            "commentText": "KasumiKriss\n\n\nOut of curiosity, are you basing this perspective on your religious beliefs or are your views secular?  Part of the the problem is that women aren't actually generally as <b> promiscuous </b>as you are assuming.  It only looks that way because it is what is shown in pornography and movies/tv.  Also, you say that women are more emotional but that isn't really true.  It's just more socially frowned upon for men to show their emotions.  Plus, men often are even more emotional than women in many cases.  For example, it's usually men who get more violent and angry when rejected by the opposite<b>  sex</b>.  Men also tend to be the ones who resort to wars.  The other problem is that most of the studies you are talking about that show that women who have mor<b> e sexua</b>l partners are less happy in marriage are conducted by religious people who have bias against women havi<b> ng sexu</b>al freedom.",

But don't come here with all those stereotypes pretending to be some guru that will enlighten people. And for your information, you have completely misunderstood feminisim. It is not against men, we don't ask for more, we ask for equal rights because we are<b>  nothing</b> less an<b> d nothin</b>g more. In other words it is not against men, it is against women like YOU who are the ones to blame why women were treated like objects with centuries, not men. 'WHAT YOU GIVE POWER TO, HAS POWER OVER YOU.'  And if you think that men are smarter and more ambitious then try analyzing kids at school and see who is better and more ambitious to get good grades in general. Girl, I am more ambitious and have a better career than most of the men I am surrounded with. If you are lazy, okay, I understand, but luckily not all women are girls like you, many are REAL GROWN-UP WOMEN, something you don't know about. And yes I always thought so and you are a living proof, women without self-love and self-respect who feel less are the reason why women were in a bad position for so long and why feminism started at a first place. And I hope YouTube will stop suggesting me your funny videos who never fail to make me hit the roof. W O W and btw housewife is not a real job if it is then quit 'working' as one for a month and you will see what your home will look like. That won't happen in any real working environment because they will replace you asap. Home is a responsibility of the people who live there, not a job. Which is different, but if you are lazy and wanna call it a job to feel that you are actually working something, go ahead! Let's see what will happen if someday you break up with your bf/husband (who seems like he has adopted a lazy teenage daughter instead of a mature partner) , you will then go to 'work' in your parents house and be a housewife there so they will support your lazy ass, don't you? As f<b> or s</b>ex, stop putting your nose in other's people private lives no matter if they are women or men, you <b> are noth</b>ing but a submis<b> sive w</b>oman with a closed mind who<b>  does no</b>thing but talk about stereotypes convincing herself that she is a guru(in bashing women) that will brain wash all of us. Some women do not deserve to be called as such, you are indeed one of them. Look at the comments below your videos and you will see only men bashing women just like you do. Congrats for that, I guess that's your goal \ud83d\udc4fREAL PEOPLE OF VALUE WHO VALUE HUMANS ARE FEMINISTS BECAUSE FEMINISM IS ABOUT EQUALITY NOT BASHING ONE OR THE OTHER. There are so many men who understand this wayyy better than you, real men are feminists. And so are real women, but yo<b> u know n</b>othing about that I guess. You put everything on scale<b>  and do </b>nothing but comparing people. Oh and the world is not only made of straight people, you seem to forget about that while bashing women with all those stereotypes, but yet again, I am not surprised that you do. Typical for someone like you whose 'lectures' are based on stereotypes instead of actual facts.",

And those are even worse than the whole wrongness, the whole lies, that everyone can see. Half-truths are deceiving and so by far more dangerous and damaging on the long run, because of the difficulties to expose them.

            "commentText": "Too many generalizations in this video. The generalization that women sleeping around don't have long lasting relationships is bogus. Everyone is different and everyone's situation turns out different. Sometimes sitting around being the \"good girl\" can still land you in an unfulfilled relationship, getting cheated on, etc. A failing relationship has many factors; some big ones are incompatibility, rushing into marriage(because you have to be married to be fulfilled in life, apparently), unfaithfulness from either party, and my personal favorite, people upholding this fairytale image of marriage that is far from the truth and the reality is not what they expect at all. Also childhood traumas and other unhealed parts of ourselves, which means one or both of them being mentally and emotionally unhealthy people getting into relationships when they should be working on themselves to become healthy, whole people first.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there is a huge gap in the reasoning that men are made and are supposed to sleep around and women aren't. If men are \"allowed\" to sleep around and are doing so, they are likely sleeping around with women, right?. Therefore they are adding to the list of <b> promiscuous </b>women and then turn around complaining that there are too many<b>  promiscuous</b> women. So either it's acceptable for everyone to sleep around or no one does and everyone should wait. Quite a lot of men here talk abou<b> t promiscuou</b>s women not being able to settle with one man as if most men are being super faithful after having their fun beforehand. I'm personally not a fan of sleeping around by men or women because I feel people should respect themselves to find a quality partner. That is your most vulnerable state and an energy exchange happens so if you don't know who you're dealing with you'll be taking on their shit. It's best to always find a trust<b> ed s</b>ex partner\r\n\r\n\r\nNot everyone wants a relationship or has that as their end goal, and marriage is a social construct. There was a time when marriage <b> had noth</b>ing to do with love! It was designed as a transaction between the families for resources and wealth. Marriage as we know it is a rather recent concept, even monogamy wasn't always the norm. People should do what works for them cause we are all wired differently. Generalizations are so harmful in any sense.",

            "commentText": "Ask yourself....outside of a loving committed relationship why does someone desire a <b> sexual </b>encounter?  Seems to me it is basically falls into 2 areas.  The first is the power or control aspect.  It's having the perception that I can get this person to do what I want.  The 2nd is the fase narrative that<b>  sex</b> is a form of validation and approval.  I heard it said that when someone wants to hav<b> e se</b>x with you it is perceived as the \"ultimate approval\".  So someone with low self esteem or perhaps a false sense of self feels that they need this perceived approval and validation to feel whole or good enough.  In both cases, the low self esteem and empty self drives people to ha<b> ve promiscuo</b<b> >us sex</b>ual encounters over and over.  It never fills the empty void but they keep trying to get the illusionary result through this \"fix\".  This is why some people become chronic cheaters chasing this illusion to fill their void.",

You could call that the power of attraction, but everything is up to interpretation.

Third who saiddddd whooo told you that women are not logical and more emotional than mennnn whooooooo ??!! Women do have brain to think and they are not stupid, but they have emotions too and men are the same okay . Don't act like my grandpa please. Forth if you don't have any problem to date and love a player who does have a multiple partners more than you and play with feelings and you say that it's okay for men to have multiple opinions more than one<b>  woman</b> in their life , then go date a player okay , but don't throw shade at women because they have the same rights as men okayyyy you like it or not . And if <b> a woma</b>n does have a multiple partners and she is plying it's not our business okay . The same as men if they play around too much at the end , they will be unbalanced. Last thing you need to know there is no difference between men and women because we are all humans okay \ud83d\udc4c , and when a girl does have a rights she does have a rights it's not trendy it's natural.",

Because today no girl/woman is able to do such things anymore. Most of the girls I know are completely messed up. They have absolutely no structure in their daily routine, their laundry is a mess. And cleaning?... Well forget it. Just take a look under the bed. Used tampons, chocolate paper, things they are looking for all the time (were are my keys/phone/purse?), ... you name it. The keys are in one of the pants in the laundry; the phone sticks between the mattress and the bed frame and the purse is under the bed. Right?! One sock is under the pillow, the other sticks inside one pant leg and this pant is somewhere inside the wardrobe, probably inside the pile of clothes on the wardrobes floor at the very bottom. The laptop is under the pile of sheets on the office chair (don't sit down on any chair, you will be surprised what you find), the laptop is not charged most of the time, especially when they need it; the desktop is full of icons (mostly pictures of little animals), and all the passwords for e-mail and all the social media accounts are stored within the applications. Right?!\n\nAnd it's getting even better. Dates? They always come too late. Shopping? They like to discuss the whole product list the market offers even if you made a plan for what to buy in the first place. Weekends? The last minute before you want to leave for the weekend activities, their moods are changing; they suddenly don't like the people you planned to spend the weekend with; they would rather like to stay in bed; ...\n\nIn short terms: unreliable, volatile and either bored or cranky all the time.\n\nAnd if you want to do your own things alone because you are sick of this shit, they call you \"selfish\", \"arrogant\", \"ignorant\", ... You know what I mean.\n\nToo many women behave like children. Far too many. What I do? I treat them like children and it works fine for me.",

Ok you recognize the fact that promiscuity wouldn't work for YOU but in what universe can you get in the mind of another person and say that it wouldn't work for him either? Just because you feel this way? Even myself I believe <b> sex </b>should be involved only where love exists and that should apply to BOTH genders but it takes years and experience and mistakes to fully understand what love is. You may think you found the one.. you slept with that person and you broke up after 3 years. Now what? Are you broken? No chance it was just a learning experience? This is learning by trial and error.. and in no way society should 'fix' the balance between genders by making one repeat the mistakes of the other. That's such a complex subject that having an absolute opinion only makes you a stupid person.",

Thats a conversation my brother and I have had many times..........that when women got their rights and freedoms they used it and many degraded themselves in the process, their marriages don't work and they are largely dissatisfied with their lives. Im still young in my 30's and when I think about how diseases we prevalent here 20 years ago, then you multiply that by  how freely women give themselves away today.............I dont think people are doing the math on the effects its having on our society now or 30 years from now. Its become so bad women expect you to take them home the first date and smash or some will think you're <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>if you don't. This is America present day 2019, its not a joke, all of it is true!",

I know I don't deserve that, though, because I look up porn and masterbate to it all the time. \n\nThe reason why girls go out and hav<b> e se</b>x with multiple partners is because they are attracted to behaviors and attitudes that few men have, and when women find a men whom turns them on, it's a rare find for them, and it's much harder for them to pass it up. On the other hand, there are few men whom know game good enough to get a steady stream of women into their beds, and men whom are good with women don't really need to stay with one partner, so when the greatest victory men experience is having women submit to him and ha<b> ve s</b>ex with them, why would he be loyal? Especially when women reward him and find him even more attractive for having <b> had </b>sex with multiple women. Women generally have a submissive nature toward whom she is attracted to (wants to be conquered), while men build their confidence and manliness upon getting what they wa<b> nt -</b> sex and women, LO<b> TS O</b>F SEX AND WOMEN, so dominant and masculine men get the girls, while more gentle natured or less confident men end up looking up porn, masturbating or abstaining until marriage. \n\nI'll be honest, I could <b> have a</b> woman whom <b> has </b>had sex before (especially since I'm spraying my seed all over), it's just I don't want her to choose and prefer the other men over me. Even if she has DNA of other guys in her, I'd still want my DNA to be the strongest and be the most desirable to her. My roommate has a girlfriend right now whom was married to an abusive husband, and she implies very strongly that she prefers the turn on of dominant abuse compared to the gentle and compliant nature of my roommate. Being in a relationship like that would depress most men and strip them of confidence and manliness. The strength of men comes from women, for what is a man w<b> ithout</b> a woman and family? Women aren't less as human beings, nor are they less in importance, but they are inferior in authority of men. Even so, women should never underestimate their effect on men. So many things that make a man confident, masculine and attractive are built upon the submissive and gentle nature of women.",

However, in a RELATIONSHIP, be it platonic, romantic, employment, business....BOTH parties have to exercise reciprocity and provide value. \nPlease tell me why any man would want a committed relationship with a <b> woman </b>who had<b>  nothing</b> to offer outside o<b> f se</b>x? \nYour response, if you really think about it, is the epitome of the sentiment and attitude many younger American women have. It's the exact reason the percentage of men willing to commit and marry is at a historical low.

They are the only ones that can do it now. The laws and media are such that men will get shut down before they can really do anything. Women need to fight to deplatform feminists at every turn. Throw in a few pro men marches and fight to end the current system that sticks it's nose in the marriage and maybe men will be able to slowly put faith back in women. Also if women think them sleeping around is okay and then expect a husband they are dead wrong. \n\nIf you are sleeping around then what makes you more valuable to a man than a prostitute? You show that you have no value in your body, have insecurity, and aren't very good at planning ahead. No man truly wants to go down on a <b> woman </b>knowing he is going places many other men have been. It's just disgusting. Women keep some of that genetic material in them from each partner no matter how well she cleans up. The idea makes me want to vomit tbh. No way in hell. I'll die alone before I go down on that snatch.",

I don't care how different men and women are, having a set of moral standards for one <b> sex </b>and another set for the other is oppressive. Think about women who already realized they won't find the man they deserve. Do they not have the right to have<b>  sex</b>? Shall they be virgins forever? And if they are divorced and can't find good men, shall they give up the pleasure o<b> f se</b>x for the rest of their lives?  \n\nAnother problem stemming from this oppression of women:  in countries where women are raised believing it is shameful for women to ha<b> ve s</b>ex outside of marriage, men complain that their wives are terrible in bed. Then they go to other women, mostly foreign women, who will do those things their wives won't do. <b> \n\nA wo</b>man just can't win. If she is experienced in bed and l<b> ikes</b> sex she is a whore. If otoh she doesn't<b>  lik</b>e sex much or lacks the experience to please a man (for no fault of her own, mind you), she is deemed frigid or bad in bed. \n\nYou are not doin<b> g your </b>gender a favor by promoting these ideas.",

As for the man whore vs women whore statement I have to agree. Both men and women should be looked at equally based on their body count but unfortunately that's not the way society looks at it. Most male and females have respect for a male who can get with many women ONLY because it's more difficult to get with women compared to women getting with men and can you really blame them? It's only natural to value a key that can open many locks and not value a lock that can be opened by many keys",

So...no your theory is wrong IMHO.\nOpening the door to<b>  sex</b> should be taken seriously by th<b> e woma</b>n and the womans job is make the man prove that he is worthy.   How does a man prove he is worthy, he communicates it and then over time (a number of dates that share truthful conversations) his actions match his talk.   The womans job is to be discerning and question him on his past relationships.  If he claims to have none, its<b>  a <b> r</b</b>>ed flag, if he claims his last relationship lasted a short t<b> ime<b>  </b</b>>(red flag), if he refuses to talk details about why they bro<b> ke <b> u</b</b>>p (red flag).  No actua<b> l n<b> a</b</b>>mes (red flag).  Hides his phone when<b>  it<b>  </b</b>>rings (red flag).\nA man cannot discuss his past without slipping up event<b> ually,</b> but a woman knows if she asks about it, the date may be over and she wont ask so she can say later, he's a pig, he only wanted one thing,  etc..    \nI don't care how many rela<b> tionsh</b>ips the woman has had, I can tell by her stories and her answers to my questions what her nature is, i can tell by her home, her grooming, her achievements, etc.  If she takes good care of herself, and kids, or others,  but if she has had lots of relationships it only tells me she favors being very social and likes to flirt, but that doesn't make her a nun and it doesn't make me think she is unworthy.   She may appear a bit more 'easy' but then if she is regal she will not hesitate to put the wolfish men in their place and abandon them.   \nAs far as relationships go...  I always told my daughters its far better to be on your own than take a guy who doesn't reciprocate your efforts towards them.  Relationships must be balanced to last. There are too many guys that take and take and they are not worth any investment.   It always ends in feelings of low self esteem (why didn't he love me, am i not worthy of love, etc.) when it should have never started (because all the signs were there, your friends told you not to date him and you refused to simply question him without getting evasions for answers).  \nThe most attractive thi<b> ng goi</b>ng for a woman is the fact she is at peace and doesn't need me (has hobbies, friends to hang out with, likes to read and takes time instead of rushing around).  I want to come home to peace.  If she is constantly feeling anxious and needy, its a major turn off, just FYI. I'll bet the women feel the same way.  They dont want an angry man, a petulant child waiting to be served and worshiped, they want a man who takes care of business and is calm, and when he gets her things she mentions wanting (she knows she is cared for).\nRelationships are like a couple dancing together.  The longer the it goes on the more it is meshes.  The wife and husband cannot be understood often and if you listen to what the wife or husband says and witness the answer or actions of the other it doesn't make sense, but the husband knows what the wife meant to say, and the wife knows the meaning of the husbands actions and words and they are as one mind.",

            "commentText": "I think the internet is an echo chamber. Most people that are experiencing bad things in their life tend to post more online. People that enjoy their life tend to not post things on the internet (reddit, forums, etc). There's so much negative shit on the internet and perhaps it's because of negativity bias. All the men on the MGTOW, <b> Red<b>  </b</b>>Pill, Incel stuff, many of the posts I see are very negative. \n\nI always question, who are the people posting behind the keyboard. Are they truly credible? Do they have their shit together in life, do they clean their own room? Or is it just people who go outside infrequently?\nWhen it comes to Amazon, more people are likely to post a negative review if something bad happens as opposed to a positive review. More people post bad shit about their lives or viewpoints than the good cause people enjoying their lives aren't on the internet posting things as frequently. \n\nAnyone can easily bias themselves on anything with selective information bias. It's an issue with the curren<b> t ag</b>e we live in where there is complete accessibility of all sorts of info through the internet. If you think women are horrible, you can google hundreds of posts about it. If you think men are horrible, you can google all sorts of post on the worst of men. All reinforcing the bias one may already have. \n\nIf you're consuming content or information the worst of women or the worst of men on a consistent basis than it skews perception. In normal day to day life, people are chill and cool. I don't get all these skewed perceptions of reality people ascribe too. Most women are cool, most dudes are cool, sure there are so<b> me cra</b>zy ones. Demonizing or belittling the other people or the oppos<b> ite </b>sex is just toxic.\n\nI scroll down the YT comment section of these types of vids and it's toxic sometimes god fucking damn.",

After that, things went downhill and I had casual <b> sex </b>with two more guys. It made me unhappy because I had lost respect for myself. There was no connection and it was purely physical, which left me empty inside. When I connected my unhappiness to the fact that I was getting validation from being considered hot by guys, I decided to stop. I am now in a much better state of mind because I have self respect. I only hope I can still find a guy who realizes the person I am now is completely different from the one who went astray those few months.

I'm sure there are  alot of people who didn't have a lot of<b>  sex</b> with others, and chose to settle with one person and they still broke up or cheated on  one another. You have to understand there's nothin you can do, that will be able to make someone stay. If  what you are saying is right, then why are there so many  divorce rate? Stop trying to impose your own ideas onto people  just to restrict them of their freedom. Everyone is free to sleep with  anyone they want and it doesn't matter  if you ar<b> e woma</b>n or a man. There<b> 's nothi</b>ng shameful about th<b> at. </b>Sex is a beautiful and wonderful  thing that you can express  with anyone, you don't have  to limit yourself  and only express  that experience  with just one person. Ever thought, that maybe being with    the same person, kissing the same person and ha<b> ving</b> sex with the same person can be boring. In beginning, it is exciting  because you guys have alot of expectations and so the attraction seems like it  high.  After awhile once you guys get used  to one another, the attraction gradually starts to   diminish.   Then you  have to  constantly work hard to keep the attraction  and relationship going.  Attraction isn't something that  is permanent. You can love  someone and not be attracted to them.  Now if  you see yourself trying hard to forcibly  try to spice up your relationship or  try to forcibly make a relationship work, then that means that  your relationship is  boring and you are starting lose the attraction that you guys once had.  Why you think people tend to say, that we were once happy , what happened. What happened was you guys loved the idea  of a   one another. You never loved the person, you loved what you expected of that person to do for you, to make you feel good about yourself.  And that's what alot of people fail to realize is that if you only love someone because  of  what thet do  and give you to  make you  feel special and happy. Then what happens if they stop providing what you  are looking for, are you going to break up and resent them. If you do then it makes your love very conditional and it also makes you  narcissistic.  Because all you care about is wanting to feel special and you are addicted to that.  That's what makes people think  that they're  in love with someone, when in reality you're simply attached and addicted to how they make you feel. That's a form of narcasstism. And alot of people confuse it for love.",

For many women, they tend to be happier once they find that one man who can make her happy for the rest of her life.  I think it's important we teach the next generation of ladies to not sleep with the entire block.  That they should have reasonable, achievable standards when it comes to choosing men, which benefits not only her but also him.  We need to teach women to learn how to find a good men who will help her build herself up while she supports her man through the good and bad times.  They need to learn to create a world where it's ok for her man to express himself to her in an honest manner.  Strong and clear communication is one of the most important factors for any relationships to survive!!!",

In ones 20s people experience their lives and figure themselves out, they're getting out of university, finding jobs, making sense of dating and seeking pleasure. This is all a very healthy and normal life, any <b> old </b>person will encourage you to make the most of it. It's understandable to me that when you're in that growth period you're not going to 100percent chance upon the person you want to marry from the get go, in fact you're going to go through many trials and errors and even lose your momentum along the way and even your faith. I think we need to be realistic and educated when talking about these matters than villanising people who are only starting their adult lives out from their 20s.\n\nThe comments demeaning women are motivated by envy through rejection. Dr Jordan Peterson talks quite clearly about how female natural selection (rejection and choosing a<b>  sexual</b> partner) can deeply hurt a man's psyche. Shaming is a tactic used to possess those very women into submission. \n\nWomen are becoming more selective and careful with settling down, that's the hard science of it. My parents in their day, finding marriage was a cultural pressure regardless. Now days most of us are well educated, we consider the decisions we make and so it naturally follows we will be more discriminatory with who we choose and if we are even ready. I haven't looked at many people and felt they were going to make good parents or partners to each other, so that says something, the divorce rates affirm this too. \n\nI see a lot of cognitive dissonance going on and I worry about the quality of intellect we have in these comments.",

We know this because some one night flings turn into marriage and others are just one off experiences where the <b> woman </b>choose to move on to the next. Any interaction with the opposite<b>  sex</b> (or sam<b> e se</b>x) plays a very real role in contributing to our natural selection mechanism. You're falling short on realising that intention to select doesn't equate to selection always.\n\nOur natural biology instructs us to test our options even without our awareness of what it is we are doing, perhaps it is merely the product of what we do that we come to an end in finding someone to settle down with or we stop knowing its time to be intentional and that can be but not always that we reduce our sleeping behaviours, some people are hyper testers whether they intend it or not ie fuck boys, \"sluts\"... \n\nThe way you began your comment sounds motivated by something personal, try removing yourself from your own experience and looking at science, human behaviour.

You are assuming that the majority of men and women nowadays act <b> promiscuous </b>because of purely evolutionary reasons. However, the majority of people will never sit on a bench and reflect upon their inner biological workings and come to the conclusion that \"the reason why I sleep around is because I try to select this ideal partner\". They do it because of indoctrination and that is what society dictates us to do. The women I've casually slept with always argumented something along the lines \"I currently just want to have fun and<b>  nothing</b> serious\". It is a choice that they made. I've also had encounters where they would get attached to me or have some feelings in the primitive stage and they would then end the casual relationship because of their choice of not wanting anything serious at that time.\n\nI simply cannot see ho<b> w se</b>x is helping you determine your life partner. What do you gain from sleeping around with multiple people? How does that help you select your ideal partner?\n\nI at one point slept with three women in a casual relationship rotation.

How is a one-night stand a selection of a life-time partner or not? You gain <b> nothing </b>in terms of selection from sleeping around. You do not know that person at all. And one night stands are precisely that: A thing for a night. They do not end in marriage.\n\nDo you have any books or scientific articles to provide for you saying that in ones 20s it is natural to be<b>  promiscuous</b>? And that even in primitive societies this is the case, regardless of moral values and indoctrination?\n\nAnd no. I have not learned that I do not want to be with the women I've slept in the past. Because those casual relationships are precisely what they were: From the beginning they served the purpose of pure pleasure without any commitment and without getting to know the person any deeper. That was the basis of these relationships. By your argument, prostitutes should be professional natural selectors when it comes to selecting life-partners. \n\nAs you say it is a choice to seek pleasure or settling down. Precisely my point. Your case that women are sleeping around due to selecting the best partner is wrong and you said it yourself: They (and men) sleep around due to there choice and settle down due to their choice and not because their biological inner workings tells them to do so in their 20s. We are not slaves to our primitive evolutionary impulses. We were once. But we have a choice as a civilized society and we are not savages anymore. Simple as that and you said it yourself. \n\nDo not use evolution as an excuse for a societal trend and the choice why people in their youth sleep around. It is their choice and not that they cannot avoid it.",

At no point have I claimed that sleeping around equates to finding an end mate, my initial comment statement something more nuanced that for those who take issue with women sleeping around and rejecting male candidates is something we should respect as their right to choose and for the bigger picture this means women and people will keep practicing discrimination (selection) until they find an end mate. Now whether sleeping around means no intention to settle down is not anything I contest, that in itself is precisely discriminatory selection where a person is choosing what to do with their reproduction functions.\n\nI've met my share of \"fuck boys\" but I'm not going to stand around generalising the entire male population and demeaning their <b> sexual </b>behaviour simply because they aren't choosing me, the empowered thing to do is shift my focus elsewhere which is to seek out the kind of man I want and/or in the appropriate spaces and see where that could lead.

                    "commentText": "@humanityandme I understand now. I will tell you how I think about the condemnation of sleeping around:\n\nI personally see this as a reputational system to label men and women who sleep around. The reason for this is because it helps you weed out the people who do not seek anything serious and you can protect yourself from such predators. At the same time you know who is just sleeping around and if you desire such a life-style, then it makes choosing easier. Because at the end of the day as much as we argue scientifically humans will lie and deceive to get what they want. I see the condemnation as a defense mechanism in society and removing it might have some serious consequences. Also not everyone is like you and has self-awareness and choice over their action by actually thinking deeply about topics like these. Most people just follow whatever the norm is within the society and time period they grow up. Nietzsche called such people herd animals.\nThis often leads people to make wrong choices and be unhappy.\n\nI know a girl who was committed to a long-term relationship. She was happy and in love and her partner was her best friend as well. She went to university and broke up with him just to experience college life style before settling down because that is what is expected nowadays in that life stage and her female friends encouraged her and she also saw that her friends were participating in casual hookup culture. Now, this girl ruined her relationship, did not enjoy the casual hookup dating culture, felt used, felt emotionless, and unhappy.\n\nNow, whether using terms such as \"bitch\" or \"fuck boy\" is the right choice? I do not know. Probably not since it is insulting and humiliating.\n\nOf course you shouldn't generalize the entire male population and we should not generalize the entire female population either. However, it is often not easy to just say next when feelings come into play and you were mislead or used.\n\nI personally, do not have any problems with rejection. I make my intentions clear for what I desire pretty early when I meet someone or the moment I see that something serious is emerging.",

Do you agree?\n\nYou've used the anecdote of the pressures of hook up culture and how that turned out being what that girl did not want, I empathise with her rather than condemn her for finding herself within hook up culture no matter how many men she has slept with, I think ideas promotion hook up culture are dangerous in this context. On the bright side, this girl learned and now can make the conscious effort to redeem herself in her dating life however I'm sure she will find herself troubled by judgmental men who can't embrace what her journey was and forgo the opportunity to seriously date someone who is otherwise worthy.\n\nTo reiterate, I agree that hook up culture is pressuring people to behave promiscuously when they'd otherwise not want to do, this touches on the issue of consent arguably too which I think social leaders should put their focus into guiding people to be in touch with themselves and not the herd mentality, there's also the notion that people want to try and learn from the experience whether it hurts them or not and I am not sure if we can remove that choice. Second, if people are transparent in choosing a<b>  promiscuous</b> lifestyle and in control of their intentions then that's their own business and shouldn't be used as ammunition to dimish their worth especially when it comes to choosing an end mate. A classic example of shaming women for excefisinf her right to sleep around is someone in the comment section brought up telegony, the theory whereby a woman's children resemble the traits of her previou<b> s sexua</b>l partners because sperm bonds to dna in her body, this commenter then said that this is why women who have slept with many men ar<b> e \"cra</b>zy\" because her brain has been impeded too...

To me such behavior usually signals the following thoughts:\n\n- I cannot trust this person since sleeping around signals relationship instability (of course people change but what if I invest 5 - 10 years into a relationship and then this person reverts back to bein<b> g promiscuou</b>s?)\n- sleeping around increases the chance of STDs and some STDs can still be transmitted using condoms\n- Do people actually lose the ability to intimately bond if treati<b> ng s</b>ex casually?\n- Does this person seek the attention and validation from multiple people<b> ?\n- </b>Sex and orgasm are highly intimate bonds between people due to the release of serotonin and oxytocin (the hormones which makes people fall in love). Kissing, cuddling and so on also releases these hormones. Thus, in essence you actually develop some emotional bond with e<b> very se</b>xual partner you encounter. Will this person ever revert back and leave me for a pre<b> vious s</b>exual partner just because of the intimate bond? Will I ever do this? You also sometimes here people say \"I am confused between loving person a and person b\". Which to me indicates that promiscuity actually might harm your future serious love-life. \n\nWhat are your thoug<b> hts on promi</b>scuous behavior and how it changes people's personality. What about their psychology?",

All such things can be at play and not define whether a person will remain <b> promiscuous.</b>\n\nI once had a partner who wanted a \"let's see how things go\" relationship, they were open to other partners and it put me in a constant state of anxiety and fear that I would be left, wasn't good enough and therefore had to dilute the bond I felt with him and keep the rest of my emotions free and receptive to others just in case, this was my first experience of being affected by hook up culture and for a while feeling very fearful of bonding with one person in future and therefore always keeping a part of me held back or in other cases thinking it was normal to go fast into dating experiences. I have questioned whether this has primed me to be<b>  promiscuous</b> (I wasn'<b> t promiscuou</b>s) but if one simply pauses and takes time to detox their life such as self reflection, healthy habits (working on oneself) then I think the buzz for promiscuity will die down and in place of that you can put in place the concerted effort to consciously go into dating with the intention of having one person. Also it's not just promiscuity, but emotional bonds with other people from a number of serious relationships someone had can even play into this inability to focus on just one person.\n\nI think mindfully setting the intention, knowing why you're doing can work with brain plasticity. It's like forming a habit.\n\nUltimately it's down to trial and error. End of the day if someone doesn't meet you half way or if you don't then there is no pairing/relationship occuring and one has to let it go and move forwards unless there's conscious effort to recognise a problem and fix it. People may not realise the consequence of promiscuity until they find themselves consciously wanting one person but struggling to discipline their learned behaviour which they no longer identify with.\n\nI'm not the expert on this though.",

All such things can be at play and not define whether a person will remain <b> promiscuous.</b>\". Well look. I think that it is important to consider the cause behind it. Let us assume that it was loneliness. Well then, to me that indicates that this person has some issues. Let us say I am in a committed relationship with a person who has loneliness-issues. What if I have to go on a business trip for 5 months? Will she be loyal or due to her loneliness invite another man into her life.\n\nThe things that you mentioned are indicators of emotionally unstable people. This again is helpful to guide you in dating people who have the qualities that you desire in a partner. I. e. I desire emotional stability in a<b>  woman</b> and not a female who shows symptoms of borderline personality disorder.\n\nFrom what I've gained about you is that you rely far too much on trial and error. I believe that is a bit naive and it could get you hurt easily even though you can avoid it (and from what I take you have been hurt in the past). Such a red-flag system is quite helpful even though imperfect as you point out. But in the majority of cases it helps you pin-point the partners you do not want. And if you get one wrong by prejudice, then that is okay. It's a far better system than brute rote trial and error.\n\nI empathize with you on your experience. I myself was no<b> t promiscuou</b>s until my very first relationship which ended 7 years ago in her cheating after three years of commitment and it set me on this path. As you see and I mentioned earlier, most of us do not want to <b> be promiscuo</b>us. It does not seem to reflect our \"nature\". It is often a reaction to our own personal experiences and what society expects or what the norm is nowadays.\n\nAnd yes you are right that with introspection one can come to an evaluation of what makes one truly happy: M<b> any sex</b>ual partners? or on intimate partner who stays with you through good and bad times?\n\nBut how many people have this ability of introspection? I would say, from my own personal experience, the majority of people are not capable. They simply just live without thinking deeper and complain about their unhappiness.\n\nI've also talke<b> d to eld</b>erly and asked them what makes them truly happy. Most of the time they give me the following answer: \n\nDeep and strong relationships with family members, friends, partner (love-life), children. So far none of them has mentioned being with mul<b> tiple s</b>exual partners. There is also a Ted Talk somewhere on this. \n\nI enjoyed discussing this topic with you since I am at a point where I reflect upon my past and need some guidance. Thank you!",

But I suppose some of the things he says, is kind of like a drug for women so they don't think clearly (similar to the dopamine hit that ordinary Instagram e-thots get from attention or praises for their beauty photos).\n\nWhat good ol' boy Jordie isn't telling you though, is that your selection options for male partners is drying up in society today, not the other way around. Does he warn of this at all? I don't know, because I can't stand listening to propaganda in general, especially not from a \"professor\". I prefer reality to be my teacher, not just theory.\n\nNow certainly your options for <b> sex </b>partners isn't what's drying up, but it is for marriage. You'll see that I'm right in time, and that Mr. Peterson helped f*ck up a lot of people's lives with his irrelevant pablum that panders to the female ego only.\n\nAnyway, the real world will teach you what university propaganda / brainwashing indoctrination will not, so there's hope yet.

I personally think that he is a bit too harsh on males (but this might be because his male audience is not the classical standard of a \"masculine\" man). And a bit naive when it comes to the dating scene. He assumes that females are in dating for purely selective reasons. But truth be told, many reject for fun, many reject for looks, many reject for money, many reject because they have already a hand full of dating partners and cannot handle another one at the time. His reasoning applies in a world where the core assumption is that females operate in the dating scene primarily for selecting a partner to settle down. This is too discrepant from today's casual dating hookup culture. Thus, none of Peterson's arguments apply. It could also be that the females that he is talking about are at the stage of settling down, then his arguments do apply. But they definitely do not apply to modern young females of the West where settling down is pushed towards the end of one's 20s/early 30s or beyond.\n\nToday's dating scene is at its fundamental core to be <b> promiscuous </b>and have fun. I've yet to meet a person who says \"I want to date multiple people at the same time because that increases my chances of settling down\". It is simply not the case. They do it because they are young and that's expected from them at that<b>  age</b>, they are at university, they fear commitment, they fear abandonment, and of course over-sexualised media such as the music industry and movies have made sleeping around the norm. \n\n\u00a0But all of this behavior comes at a cost and as you said: \"Anyway, the real world will teach you what university propaganda / brainwashing indoctrination will not, so there's hope yet.

Because I'm a critical thinker I will extract what's reasonable from any and every thinker, Petersons segment on natural selection is concrete science and I'm not going to engage in your cognitive dissonance that this is what's not playing out in reality. Also the very notion that I'm a feminist and postmodernist would be enough to give Peterson an aneurism, it's women like me he absolutely loathes and considers cancers to society, all of this to say, nice attempt at trying to control my confidence to express myself by engineering an idea that I'm a loyal Peterson follower. I can see I bother you. \n\nI don't sleep around, I'm also going to be 27 this year. There's absolutely no sheltering from the outside world by this stage. I've noticed people with your mindset seem to think just because someone has been university educated that it means they don't engage with life and learn skills practically, there's so many hours in a day, a week, a month and a year, life evolves within that time and you spend the rest of your time 'living'... \n\nAs for me allegedly lacking options for marriage, sorry to burst your bubble but  I've had men who want to marry me however I've not felt well suited to them and that's a dangerous way to go into marriage through forcing oneself or being forced, to raise a family if one isn't comfortable with the pairing. That's the first rule my upbringing instilled in me. \n\nAll I've gathered from your comment is \"you're a <b> woman </b>who men can't settle down and that bothers me because I've been personally affected therefore here's all the ways I'm going to attempt to make you feel just as inferior and flawed as I do so that you will be obedient to my will\"\n\nQuite heavy low IQ stuff to be reading on the Internet, sounds like it's coming from an Incel.\n\nEnd of the day we can spend all the time criticising women but time should be going into self development, being a better person and eventually able to seek out and be a good partner.",

Whereas I'm way more free to express truth without restraint than he is. This is probably why he's rather useless to me.\n\nNevertheless, it appears you've already adopted some of his shaming tactics, toward men, so you're kind of proving my point without even realizing it. Which is why I already know he's definitely pandering to women, because he says things that are like-minded to how you think and act now (even though you refer to yourself as \"feminist\" whilst he is not). Him being \"anti-feminist\" today is a new counter-culture attraction to young males particular (and some females), so he's just hijacking that to be more acceptable to them, all while shoving down a lot of woman-worshiping in the process (which is a bit covertly feminist, which could be why you like to listen to him regardless of his open stance on that).

You are free to either take that view or not and move on. What matters is what we/YOU are doing to situate yourself in an advantageous position to find an end mate, knowing what you know. Ie how can I become a more attractive candidate for marriage, where do I need to go to find such people, should I be on the Internet preventing someone from practising their own autonomy when I myself have my own and can find women who align to what I value in partnership....

That's all it is to me. There's much more intelligent people to spend my time listening to, that I can actually learn life-lessons from. Everything he says is basically redundant. I mean, if you subtract the biased brainwashing aspects of his opinion. I mean, it isn't a part of the real world. Basically, his talk about men vs. women is chock full of <b> mental </b>masturbation as far as I'm concerned. I guess it makes for good university discussion, but that's it. A lot of \"higher-learning\" and big words, with no substance behind it. It doesn't have a place in the real world.\n\nIn the real world, what is actually happening\u2026 is that<b>  promiscuous</b> women are basically on a binge of instant-gratification on all fronts<b>  (se</b>x, attention, other forms of ego-trips to feel self-important), because of the powers that social media provides them today. Then later in life, while their looks start to wane, they will attempt to attach to<b>  a beta ma</b>le provider for \"stability\" finally (assuming they even can, that is).\n\nIn fact \"humanityandme\" just admitted to be a great, walking / living example right now. She's 27, and about to hit the wall, which is usually aro<b> und </b>age 30. Now after sleeping around in her younger years, she's looking f<b> or a beta </b>male sucker to develop a life partner with. What a joke. I mean, that people still think smart people like me think that's not what's actually happening, and that women are the one's being ultra selective at this juncture, lol.\n\nBut many of these pote<b> ntial beta</b> male suitors are waking up too, and will be aware that they're just being used as per female desperation / as an ATM or security blanket to oppose female loneliness. This is the sad truth in society today, that Jordan Peterson I'm sure would never touch with a ten-foot pole, because it will cause him to be demonized further (socially unacceptable in public culture). Either that, or he actually is rather clueless and oblivious. I tend to think he probably knows better. As I said, he's a clever little weasel. In fact, from what I hear, he avoided being debated by certain MGTOW content creators from YouTube, so he probably knew already that he would be in a lose-lose situation, and just get cornered too quickly by that pesky little thing, called truth & reality.",

                    "commentText": "@pegpenguin I've observed this same behavior that women tend to live their life out in their youth and the moment they approach 30 they tend to settle down. I even have female friends who admit this to me. This is <b> nothing </b>new. This is taught from a young<b>  age</b> to men and women. Even my own parents encouraged me to sleep around just because your young and at university. But they often are not informed about the consequences of such advice as I pointed out in an earlier comment where I linked two papers and a Wikipedia article on BPD.\n\nI adapted a rule: If <b> a woma</b>n does not settle down with me within her youth, then she does not deserve me to be there for her when she is \"older\".\n\nAnd I am not doing this because I'm a butt-hurt male. It is very well-known that in society females are most valuable between their teenage years and until they hit 30-something. Men are disposable in society during this life-span. And Peterson actually said this himself. Women know this. And thus they live out their lives in their youth and settle down. So I am here asking myself: Why would I settle down with someone who thinks this malevolently and evil?\n\nNow, I do not subsribe <b> to <b> r</b</b>>ed pill philosophy or MGTOW. I do watch videos and read upon it and I can definitely say that a lot of what these philosophies say does fall in place with my experience and observation. But staying away or holding that much anger against women and ranting is not healthy. And IMO staying totally away from female affection and a long-term commitment is not healthy, especially in your later years. So far I am 26 and still trying to figure these things out. I still participate in dating even if I get hurt. But I definitely know how to spot the potential problematic females and kick them out of my life pretty fast (of course this becomes more difficult if you develop feelings for such a person but that should not prevent you from having self-respect).\n\nAnd I will try again and again but with defenses up so that I do not end up in a chaotic life where I lose my emotional sanity (due to females who destroyed themselves emotionally by sleeping around), or be divorced and lose my financial \"empire\" because divorce courts favor females as of today. That is all I gain <b> fro<b> m</b</b>> red pill philosophy and MGTOW. Defend yourself in a proper way and still try.\n\nIf at the end of my life I will not find my so called unicorn. It's fine. At least I tried and never gave up and I know that I was simply born in the wrong time period and lived in the wrong society.",

Thus, google for the following:\n\n(i) <b> Sexual </b>behavior in borderline behavior by Sansone\n(ii) Borderline Personality Symptomatology, Casual<b>  Sexual</b> Relationships, and Promiscuity by Sansone and Wiederman\n\nShould be the first results on Google\n\nEND OF EDIT\n\nLook at the abstract of these two papers and then read the Wikipedia article on borderline personality disorder:\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n\nWikipedia article on BDP (read the symptoms):\n\n[ Again youtube does not let me post links so read the Wikipedia page on borderline personality disorder (BPD) ]\n\nI hope that I convinced you that we should judge and criticize people who ac<b> t promiscuou</b>s in order to mild down this damaging phenomenon of casual dating hookup culture since most people do not use their brains to think this far. If we don't, then the majority of people you will come into contact in dating will show signs from the BDP symptoms list. Do you want to have such people around you? In your society?\n\nThe reason why single young women a<b> ct promiscuo</b>us is irrelevant to me unless they are one of the few humans who truly are not monogamous by nature (then we should not criticize them and accept them for what they are; however, if they desire this non-critical treatment, then it is their obligation to provide me evidence that promiscuity is inherently built in them and not that they feel like be<b> ing promiscu</b>ous). If they<b>  act promisc</b>uous out of boredom or do not want to be alone, then that is a sign of some deeper inner psychological problem. And I will always advice people (men and women) to stay away<b>  from promis</b>cuous behavior and point them to articles.\n\nThe second paper clearly show<b> s that promi</b>scuous and casual hookup behavior shows signs of BDP symptoms. Now, looking at the list of BPD symptoms should ring some alarm bells especially since in today's<b>  mod</b>ern a<b> ge w</b>here sex is tolerated without criticism (the same side you are defending) it is highly difficult to find a person who has not been sleeping around (including myself).\n\nMy point is: sleeping around comes with emotional and psychological consequences. Social leaders and educators should inform the younger people about these risks rather than encourage and push towards more free irre<b> sponsib</b>le sexual life-styles. And there is an explosion in casual hookup culture due to social media, easier communication, higher turnover of meeting new people, societal push towards conseq<b> uenc</b>e free sex, no commitment relationships, over-sexualised media, apps like Tinder, you name it.\n\nEdit: From the article I presented peo<b> ple who are </b>promiscuous actually do get some truth<b> ful tar</b>nish. Common is to say \"Women lose the ability to emotionally bond if they engage in to<b> o mu</b>ch casual sex<b> /have t</b>oo many sexual partners\", which look again at the BPD symptoms list and there is some truth to it. They have a habit to replace a partner in critical situations rather than repair. Are impulsive, and so on.\n\nPeople also tend to say that women who have slept around are \"damaged goods\". Again a primitive way of articulating things but BPD symptomatology is in essence a damaged emotional and psychological state.  In short, we usually <b> say th</b>at <b> such a</b> woman is \"crazy\" due to her emotional instability. Which again by the BPD symptoms is accurate even though a primitive thing to say.",

My rants have more to do with women thinking that men aren't aware, like we're all just slow and stupid, and should worship the ground they walk on now more than ever, and be lucky enough to kiss their feet given the chance. I don't mind deprogramming that, even if it's just for intellectual sport (trolling).\n\nI actually love women, which is why I get irritated by useless propaganda that feeds them ear-candy (ie. Peterson Pandering, etc). I'd rather be harsh, even if they hate me for it after, rather than just tell them what they want to hear, or what feeds their ego. I don't mind. I'm not here to suck up to anybody. And at least it could wake them up to reality, and what's actually going on, rather than reinforcing university talking point gibberish.\n\nObviously, you already are aware, as a young man, so that's <b> nothing </b>new to you anyway, and so perhaps how I say things sounds like<b>  nothing</b> bu<b> t r<b> e</b</b>>d pill rage. In other words, it's redundant to you at this point (as it would be to me as well).\n\nActually, I have a young niece that's living with me currently, that's just out of school, as well as an even younger niece (baby) just starting to observe t<b> his cr</b>azy world with wide eyes, so some of the concerns young women will have, affect me indirectly down the road, in a way. I guess I can't escape them entirely, lol.\n\nAs for me personally, I don't actually want to get married, or have children of my own, just for the sake of \"settling down\" or to have a family.

                    "commentText": "@pegpenguin I see where you are coming from. Well to be fair these men who put women on a pedestal as they say make the matter even worse and the so called beta orbiters too. But these men would do everything just to sleep with a <b> woman </b>which just reinforces their behavior. I've seen this many times and I have lost a handful of women just because they didn't take my criticism and moved on to a more submissive man.\n\nLet me tell you one of my recent experiences. There was a female who I got to know and we connected pretty well. We hooked up very fast and said that we do not want anything serious. It all went well for about a month. At some point we went together to a party and at the after party she asked another guy in front of me to sleep at her place. I objected to this and took her out of the apartment and told her that her behavior is disrespectful towards me and disgusting. She simply replied \"You should share me and I expect you to not react when I take home another guy in front of you\". Funny thing she at the sime would seek my affection whenever she was feeling sad or depressed and needed me for cuddling, etc. So she showed some huge signs of emotional instability disorder aka borderline personality disorder (Impulsive and extreme reactions towards mild criticism, one day affection behavior towards me and the next day she would be \"cold\", wanting to date multiple people at the same time, anxiety, insecurities; I can tell you that the entire experience with her personality was no fun at all). Well I disagreed with all of this since I consider this respect if I invest my time in going out with her and she however flirts with other men in front of me and tries hooking up with other men and if she cannot find anyone only then I will get her attention and<b>  sex</b>. It is simply not mannered and disrespectful behavior no matter what form o<b> f sexua</b>l relationship we have going on. If we go out together, we stay together that evening end of the discussion. So I broke off contact and told her that her behavior was bitchy and disrespectful (I sensed that she was trying to make me her little slave so to speak and see how far she can toy with me/how much I would tolerate; at that point I asked myself: What did she bring to our casual relationship exce<b> pt s</b><b> ex? Noth</b>ing but problems).\n\nAfter a month I showed some weakness and I contacted her and asked her for a talk because I was feeling sad about the situation. She only replied \"I do not need a talk and you made some bad accusations towards me. You also cannot expect me to waste my precious time just to make you feel better.\". At this point I wished her all the best in life and I deleted her and since ignored her.\n\nPoint of the case being. They are entitled to so much and since they can replace someone instantly, they do not even care for reflection about their behavior and introspection.\n\nI hope that you have read the abstract of the earlier papers I posted and you inform your nieces about the danger<b> s of promisc</b>uous behavior in today's society. So that they do not grow up and show symptoms of insecurity, emotional and psychological instabilities such as my above experience with that uns<b> table </b>woman. Educate your nieces and instill in them some rea<b> l go</b>od old fashioned lady like values.\n\nAbout marriage: I do not think that one should marry. I do not see the purpose of it. I never saw the purpose of marriage. I always just liked the ceremony where the two families come together and celebrate and have a big feast. What does marriage guarantee? That he or she will not cheat? Or leave? A relationship should not be built upon such chaining constraints but rather worked upon (both partners of course). I however do desire a partner since I strongly believe that love and affection from a female and sharing an intimate and deep connection is healthy.\n\nDon't you think that you will feel lonely at some point and unhappy without such a connection or without having children/a family?",

I mean, how can we quickly identify empathy vs. callousness earlier on, before trouble brews? Well I thought of at least one idea that you could possibly try. I know celebrities usually don't make the best examples, because everything could be construed as another \"photo-op\", but I'm pretty sure this is a genuine expression of someone with compassion. Just show the girl this clip on your phone next time. If she doesn't respond outside of herself, mocks it, or even grimaces, then she's a piece of shit.\n\nJust search for this video title on YouTube:\n(Selena Gomez dancing with little girl ( Revival Tour )",

                    "commentText": "\u200b @pegpenguin  I don't believe that shit-testing women makes the matter any better. I already find the casual dating scene too chaotic and unstable. I do not want to add to this problem anymore. I want to make it better for both parties. I see the emergence of tips and tricks for both genders on how to date and in my opinion this makes the matter just worse and it starts an unnecessary hatred between the two genders. I believe that we are in this together and communication and discussion between the two genders involved is the best approach and not through strategic defense or offense mechanisms. Dating should be easy for crying out loud and not a part-time job where we have to read fucking books and watch coaches or self-help crap. It is a mating process and not a god damn strategy game. It's always a chase and the power is imbalanced (women hold it).\n\nFor those who do not believe me, then try the following: Go with a female to a club. You as a male ask all females if they want to have <b> sex </b>with you immediately and go home with you now. Chances are you won't get anyone (if you're lucky then yes). Let the girl do it. She will have many men who agree to this. BTW: it is actually a fun experiment to do, you get to laugh afterwards about the reactions with your female friend :D.\n\nSo if a<b>  woman</b> behaves in shit-testing me or playing any dating games, then I immediately stop talking to her because that shows me immaturity (which I find highly unattractive) and that she is just a little sheep manipulated by her friends and blog articles like \"5 ways to make him chase you\". Such people are not worth my time.\n\nI am very radical to this. It's either you are a \"normal\" human being and devote your attention entirely to me in order to get to know me or goodbye and good luck in however you think about this dating game and with your petty amateur psychological games. In the end there will never be a perfect safe method to weed out the \"evil\" females or males. It all boils down to what @humanityandme said: trial and error and some luck. Love was never meant to be secure.\n\nA good video on love is \"Alan Watts - Falling In Love // Life Lesson Motivation\" uploaded by dawido. (keeps your romantic fantasy and hope alive :D)",

So it was a rough environment to grow up, I would say. But roughly at <b> age </b>19, when I put on some muscle mass and the<b>  fruit</b> of my integration into society and educational achievements started to show that I was working hard, they started accepting me. I actually turned many of those \"enemies\" into friends. However, I will never see them as really close friends since given the past.\n\nI moved from Germany to Sweden four years ago so I have not experienced the situation  at first hand with the flooding. But a similar situation is happening in Sweden too, so you know. I do feel some tensions here and there throughout society but as long as it stays calm, then it's okay for me. I am staying away from politics as much as possible and I do not follow news or watch TV. Never actually did. I have the feeling that it ruins my perception of the world and gives an impression that the world is far more dangerous than it actually is. And in the case that the flooding will become a serious threat to my well-being and the life how I imagine it to be, then I will move again. I will not be a collateral damage in some stupid political \"\" trend.\n\nGeorge Bruno has a reputation for being \"the father we never had\". He tries to preserve th<b> e ol</b>d classical role of masculinity in society, I believe is<b>  a <b> r</b</b>>ed pill and a firm believer in what he calls practical stoicism. He usually gives advice and wisdom. Fun to think about and sometimes laugh about but sometimes too radical as well.\n\nI can only empathize with her. I myself was raised by my grandparents till<b>  the</b> age of 11 since my parents divorced when I was 3 <b> year</b>s old and they both ran away from the responsibility. Moved to Germ<b> any </b>at age 11 then when she re-married, so basically ended up from one family to the other.\n\nI also witnessed female instability behavior at first hand. I.e. how she behaved towards her husband and in the end divorce raped him for half of his house and so on. Probably that is why I am on my defenses but not only. First three years relationship ended by the girl cheating with a good friend of mine. \n\nThis is maybe why I as a mathematician am so interested in female behavior in the dating scene. I do not buy into this narrative that people try to sell me that females are in only <b> for the</b> sexual drive and are not conscious about the mind fuckery and behavior they do. I've experience too much, same for my brother, close friends and many other males to buy into this victimized innocence game. \n\nSo far my the strongest evidence points towards entitlement at<b>  a y</b>oung age, huge expectations when it comes to selecting partners, sleeping around, showing clear signs of emotional instability symptoms, being conscious about their value when they are young and the decline of their value once they hit 30-something and thus abuse this knowledge, and the list goes on. And I have talked to <b> this wi</b>th sexual partners and female friends and many admit to doing this on a regular basis and having knowledge of this. I.e. part-taking in female fuckery. Flaking on dates because another desirable man came up. Seeking attention and validation from multiple men. Keeping men in the friend-zone as backup. Not being transparent of dating multiple partners at the same time just to give the illusion of a good girl because they see a potential partner in me but do not want to settle down at this point.\n\nSo of course I am here asking myself and many man start doing the same: Why should I t<b> ake su</b>ch a woman?\n\nOur reaction is no different from the females who know that their value in society is very valuable between their teenage years and 20s and declines after that and men are disposable during their teens and 20s and are valuable after 30+. So they use this information to live out their lives and settle down after that.\nMen start to do the same. Recognize this behavior and use that information to say \"No I will not settle down with you when your market value and youth declines\".\n\nWhere will this lead to? I do not know. Let us sit back and watch. It will be fun.",

I found an interesting paper which shows that when it comes purely to education, the trend is now in the U.S. and Brazil that women do not act hypergamous when it comes to education. The number of homogamous relationships far outnumber that of hypergamous relationships (when it comes down purely to educational degrees).\n\nTo me this indicates that th<b> e r<b> e</b</b>>d pill claim that it is in their nature is dubious or that educational status is not important to them anymore as a hypergamous criteria. Women were oppressed in terms of educational degrees until the 20th century. So hypergamy could be a societal thing. Maybe it was natural in primitive civilizations but modern civilizations (past Ancient Egypt) are far more complex than evolutionary impulses.\n\nAnother study from Hungary argues \n\"We argue that females switch between homogamy and hypergamy and vice versa, depending on the particular social circumstance.\" and \"Males, more than females, prefer and choose younger mates at marriage, whereas females tend to marry higher educated mates.\". We can see this as a hyperamous criteria from men. Men wish to marry up to young beauty. However, in Western societies young women <b> act promiscu</b>ous before settling down at the end of their 20s/early 30s and men do not see that as a good hypergamous criteria. Thus, we are left with this mating dynamic where men refuse to mate the 30+ one's and females refuse to mate in their 20s. Really stupid situation if you ask me.\n\nNote that this is Hungary and different from a more developed country like the U.S.\n\nFrom what I gather so far is that hypergamy might be natural to women in primitive times. However, in the end hypergamous trends tend to mild down where ther<b> e is ge</b>nder equality throughout society at different levels. Pointing in the direction that hypargamy is a socio-economical strategy for commitment and not a primal instinct of female behavior. \n\nSo in my view, what original feminism (not some of the radical one's) which pushes for equality of sexes at all socio-cultural dimensions (especially economic and educational wise and rights) is the best bet to get rid of hypergamous behavior.",

                    "commentText": "@salad salad Today for some reason I was thinking about this hot & beautiful girl that used to work at the local grocery store, where I used to shop. She had jet <b> black </b>hair, with teal<b>  coloured</b> eyes, and very natural, feminine lips\u2026 you know the kind. She would subtly flirt with me once in a while, but wasn't the type to make an obvious move or advancement. I suppose that's the man's job. I mean, it's obvious she wasn't the type that needed to make any advancements, but she would still drop hints. For example, one time when I was at a different cashier to check out (with an olde<b> r woma</b>n behind the counter), this younger girl would leave her station, and come to my cashier, stand right in front of me, while pretending there was actually something necessary to discuss with the oth<b> er wom</b>an. But the way she paused at one point in silence looking at me, I could tell she wanted me to say something to her, but I was more a \"deer in the headlights\" so to speak. I wasn't expecting any kind of interaction like this, I just wanted to pay for my stuff and go. Honestly, all I was thinking at the moment is that I can't afford a girlfriend right now! They too expensive, especially one that beautiful to upkeep and keep loyal, ha ha\n\nWell anyway, not long after, that grocery store closed up, and so she must have lost her job. I'm guessing she was a student probably working there just for some extra money. I'd say she was probably about 22-25 ye<b> ars </b>old or so. Keep in mind that grocery store actually paid workers well (not just minimum wage), but maybe that's why it went out of business too. You know, now quality is not a priority these days. Everything is basical<b> ly a </b>race to the bottom, sadly.\n\nWhat's the point of this? I hope you weren't expecting there to be one, lol\n\nI was just enjoying reflecting at how she had such a natural beauty. Even one day when I was there and you could tell she was obviously really tired from working long hours or from lack of sleep, and she had almost no make-up, she was still a knock-out.",

It is too naive. I can ask you a similar question: \"Why bother setting boundaries for children?\" They are creatures given by nature so they should know how to operate by their own impulses. PRECISELY: Because children have no idea about the consequences of their actions. And same for the hookup culture. We, the young population, have no information whatsoever on the consequences because our parents have no clue and our educators have no clue so no one ever informed us. We are basically rats in an experiment. I researched this and discussed my side now. I made my mind clear. There is some truth to saying nasty stuff like \"women who have slept around are damaged goods\" and I will not date women who have slept around just as a precaution towards my own well-being. Now, shaming helps me filter out these women. If you ask me \"Should we shame them?\". My answer is No. But we should label them. Should we glorify the playboy womanizer? No but we should label him. In a utopian<b>  sexual</b> reputation system we would just label people without shaming. But we can dream about such a system all day and never implement it because guess what? People lie about the amount o<b> f sexua</b>l partners when they wish to commit. I believe that society has some \"natural\" ways of dealing with many issues and labeling promiscuity is a good thing. PS: Studies have shown that it is UNLIKELY that people on campuses engage in non-committ<b> ed sexu</b>al intercourse without the abuse of substances. Another contradictory fact towards \"Just for pleasure and out of natural impulses\". Why use a dr<b> ug (alco</b>hol) to act out your \"natural\" impulse if it is so natural?",

                    "commentText": "@salad salad You made me just realize something. Perhaps the real reason that I find Peterson annoying when talking about women as though only they have the ball in their court and men are just perpetually at their mercy, is that I'm a walking / living example of how untrue that is. So it just feels like someone lying to my face (well not literally, but to a clueless crowd of young students). Especially when I hear, read, or see other examples beyond myself as well.\n\nThis doesn't mean I'm oblivious to the \"scientific\" theory behind it (which is why I simply called his unbiased aspects, as merely being redundant). In other words, it's personally useless to me to learn anything from. I mean, it's obvious that women are the ones who are the gatekeepers of <b> sexual </b>interaction (and therefor procreation). Do we really need to pay for university courses on this? Good thing I found some of his talks for free, because that's what they're worth.\n\nSo even though we know women are the primary selectors of<b>  sexual</b> interaction, does it really go any further than that? I mean, we are not cavemen anymore. Society is more complex today. To ignore that, is like having blinders on. As I said earlier, the truth of society today is that social media is allowing women to find and hav<b> e sexua</b>l partners, as easy as finding a pack of gum or candy at a corner store\u2026 perhaps even easier, because the candy sometimes even comes to you at beck-n-call! Like take-out delivery, but for free with no delivery charge. In fact, sometimes the \"food\" itself pays as it comes to you!\n\nHowever, it's also the informati<b> on a</b>ge now, where men have become more aware of female advantage, and how they use it to their benefit. In other words, becoming \"Captain Save-A-Ho\" these days, unless you've been living under a rock, has to be a more conscious decision, rather than one stemmed from naivet\u00e9, as it was in the past. And what's also crumbling is the social constructs that it's somehow still mens' \"duty\" to take care of th<b> ese promiscu</b>ous, attention-addicted, disloyal females, once their youth & beauty is finally deteriorating, far beyond any semblance of a once past innocence.",

Having inner qualities like caringness,kindness, loyalty, respectful, affectionate, selflessness, wisdom, \"smart\" etc all of these are sexy. And being able think independently too. Being able to cook is a HUGE bonus in sexiness too... It just melts my heart when a <b> woman </b>can do that. Imagine coming home from work and then you are welcomed with affection and good food too. And of course I'm not just baselessly demanding all of these from a<b>  woman</b>. I'm able to reciprocate everything ;)",

It's sad and I hate it.Some of the men in these comments disgust me though. Both men and women are affected by the soul ties of being<b>  promiscuous</b>. It weighs on both of us so I don't understand why women are the bad ones when it's men that frequently try so hard to bed us? We're then insulted for not giving you what you want, but if we do, then we're hoes. I also don't know why you'd like all of these posts about women being sluts when you could have easily gone down that path? You cannot automatically tell ho<b> w promiscuou</b>s someone is. Someone could fuck 3 people and be supper bitter and another could do 40 and be fine. I personally am not dating anyone until I'm done with school.. hopefully",

Just like any collectible or a car the condition does matter and how it was taken care of.\n\nI understand some women came from lousy backgrounds but we have access to all kinds of healing modes from exercise to meditation to herbs and research literature it's within most people's ability to find ways to improve themselves with what they have available to them.\nI started years ago with a pen and paper and just started writing and began my self research and discovery. \nYou can too.",

Also this video does not apply to people who were in relationships and it didn't work out. Move on from those people, learn from it, learn how to spot such people and do not jump into bed that fast. Always search and seek love. If it doesn't work out, that's it. Sleeping around/whoring around is the issue here. Also you might just stop loving one another. Which can happen.

She simply said she couldn't forget her past mistakes of cheating and messing with other dudes and that she would always be that way, and didn't want to keep feeling guilty by seeing me. Of course I felt like crap, because I knew I couldn't say anything to keep her around anymore. She legit said I was an amazing person but she couldn't do it anymore and dipped. Granted we had our own issues, but none that I would measure to be worth that. But in all honesty, even though it hurt, I'm basically a much happier person now and feel I've dodged a bullet. There were honestly so many signs that said to get out of the relationship much earlier but I was an idiot who was love stricken. She seemed to not want to make better choices for her life. Part of me felt I had to care for her, but that's what got me deeper into the crap from the start, caring too much.",

IMO most bad relationships come when people have this fairytale concept about relationships. The fact is that relationships are hard and require sacrifice. Just like anything in life it requires practice. Marrying the first guy you date is retarded",

I'd argue that relationships nowadays that go into marriage could actually be stronger than in the past. Just bc two people were married doesn't mean they were 'happily' married. Also abortion has no correlation with promiscuity. You can have 100 partners and never had to abort a single fetus but have 1 partner your entire life and needed multiple. Abortion has to do with access to preventable care and sometimes just luck.",

And I think the more you date the more you realize that the relationship has more to do with what can to imperfect people do to make a healthy but non ideal relationship than fantasizing about the fantasy. A lot of people end up in divorce or breaking up in relationships bc they have a fantasy that doesn't match the reality. A healthy relationship is about compromise and unselfishness",

My point was that both genders get a label for sleeping around in our society. The man gets the label \"playboy\" and usually the female gets the label \"bitch\".\n\nNow, I am not arguing that shaming or praising is good. However, I see this labeling as a reputational system to help us guide which people sleep around and weed them out when we are searching for commitment. \n\nJust as you said \"But as a<b>  woman</b> I'd never date a player who slept with a bunch of women. He'd probably just sleep around while we're dating\". That is precisely what impression I get from a female who is labeled a \"bitch\". I would not date such <b> a woma</b>n either for the same reason why you won't date a \"playboy\": You (probably) cannot trust such a person.",

Especially during high school or college.\n\nNow, I've never had a girlfriend and I certainly never slept around with anyone. But I don't care. In fact, having a girlfriend and building a meaningful relationship is something I've actually wanted out of life for many years.\n\nAnd there's another thing. People of my generation are too loose with<b>  sex</b>. This something else I noticed in college as well. Heck, I even remember a couple of lads saying that love and relationships are a waste of time.\n\nAnd yeah, feminism is such a mess these days. I mean give g women rights such as being able to have a job or vote is one thing but these days it's all \"We want to be equal to men!\" or \"All men are scum!\" and it's getting out of hand.\n\nGood talk, Krystel. I'd even say this is your best video yet.",

A lot of my friends say that when they lost their virginity there was no blood. One friend in particular said that the first time she didn't bleed cos his dick was small but the second time she did with a bigger dick then she bled, imagine marrying a guy who's dick is too small to break your hymen now he thinks you were lying about being a virgin? Anyway should I tell my boyfriend (if I ever get one) that I'm a virgin or that I've done it with one guy so he isn't disappointed ? I do masturbate though....",

            "commentText": "lf You Have to Keep Insisting That Women are Equal to Men, Then Darling, Women are NOT Equal to Men!\n\nHi. I'm Professor Cos. Notice how it is men that we are told women are equal to and not women that we are told men are equal to, not to mention that men aren't up in women's faces claiming to be seen as their equals! The word \"to\" lets you know that the default mode is set to men, which also lets you know that women acknowledge men as their superiors and are GREEN with envy and denial about it! And when the \"women are equal to men\" argument falls on its face like it always does, the \"equal in worth\" argument comes to the rescue! Yea, SURE! The real issue these women have is the reality that they are not equal to men when it comes to all the things that make men look ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! Just about any <b> woman </b>can learn how to do things that men can do, but they have to learn it from men who brought it into existence in the first place! And when they finally put on their cute little<b>  fuzzy</b> equality mittens to show the world how equal they are to men by doing anything a man can do, the cool image that interesting men possess due to their masculinity will never be exuded by <b> a woma</b>n no matter how good<b>  a wom</b>an gets at emulating men and masculinity! \n\nThe strange thing about all this equality and diversity <b> and wo</b>man power and women's marches<b>  and p</b>ussy hats and empowerment and self-esteem is that when women acquire the type of skill and knowledge and achieve the type of status and social prestige that make men stand out from average men, they tend to look down on men that are below them in that regard, whereas men just see women as they are. Men don't lose their attraction for women that they have more money, status or skills than. That should let you know that women are valued for what they are valued for, not for what men are valued for, which is why women want to be seen as equal to men! Men are the reason why we enjoy the modern world. All the cool, interesting, intellectual, fun things that we partake in were brought to you by men. Women are vessels that are used to reproduce people and to serve as outlets for recreat<b> iona</b>l sex. THAT is reality, so shoot me! Women partake in what men do, but they are not needed for it, and the world doesn't count on women for it! Women are boring. Women can be mothers and raise kids, or they <b> can be </b>sexual entertainers and swallow kids ROFL! A man's usefulness to the world is WAY more interesting and fascinating. Only men who allow themselves to be shackl<b> ed to </b>a woman or who blindly serve as cogs in the wheel live dull, uninteresting lives like women do. Like I've mentioned on numerous occasions, men get to look cool while depositing their sperm, whereas women just get to be sperm receptacles, sperm depositories, human toilets! I think it's safe to say, blessed are you, lord, our god, ruler of the universe who has not m<b> ade me</b> a woman!!!\n\nWomen's so called empowerment relies on men's weaknesses. The only types of men women are better than a<b> re do</b>pey,<b>  lame</b> ass, dumb ass dudes. Lifting women up at the expense of men isn't a testament to women's superiority. Marginalizing men and boys so women and girls can have a leg up is patronizing and condescending, not empowering. That is a good way to treat women as the inferior beings that they are. Coddling women like they are retarded children only proves how inferior they are to men. Men don't need billions of dollars spent on them to get into stem. The NBA has to lose millions of dollars each year to keep the wnba in<b>  existe</b>nce. Nobody is holding women back, women are just weak and retarded and can't handle equality. Women aren't built to be equal to men. Women are so obsessed with comparing themselves to men and competing with men and trying to get men to acknowledge them as equal to men or \"equally worthy\" as men. These are attitudes and behaviors of people who feel inadequate, insecure, and envious, not equal. I don't run around trying to prove my worth to people that are on the same level as me intellectually or otherwise. And when I see people that are better than me at anything, I admire them for it. I don't try to get even with them by shoving something I'm better than them at in their face as a pathetic way to feed them humble pie or to redeem myself. \n\nAnother strange thing about all this equality and d<b> iversi</b>ty and woman power and women'<b> s marc</b>hes and pussy hats and empowerment and self-esteem is that women hold men to higher standards than they hold themselves and other women to, all the while tormenting men into seeing them as their equals! For instance, women don't look down on women who cry all the time over every fleeting emotion they feel or express, but they would laugh at a man and see him as a wuss if he acted in similar ways. Women don't look down on women that are broke, homeless, needy, and unable to support their children, but a man in a similar position would be seen as a complete loser.<b>  In fa</b>ct, that woman would be asked by her friend or family member if she can get help from some man she might be in contact with. And get this, if said man is unab<b> le to </b>help this woman out of her situation, HE will be considered the loser! Yes, he will be considered usel<b> ess and </b>good for nothing for being unable to come to<b>  some </b>weak, needy woman's rescue! Women don't look down on women that take public transportation, but they look down their noses on men that don't own their own vehicles. Women don't look down on women that stay home and raise their kids while the provider raises her and her kids, but a stay at home dad is seen as pathetic. I could add to this list, but I think you get the point. Women seem to have a hard time swallowing the bitter truth. And the bitter truth is that men lay down the groundwork, while women just lay down on the ground and get worked, then get provided for by the government or by some man.\n\nWhat was that???\n\n\"Women invented things too\", right ladies?!\n\nLadies, I'm all out of gold stars and happy face stickers, but I hope to see you on the n<b> ext \"d</b>ay without a woman\"! Due to the amount of sandwiches left unmade at the <b> last \"</b>day without a woman\", I will NEVER forget just how important the whamen are!\n\nThe strangest thing about all this equali<b> ty and</b> diversity and woman power an<b> d wome</b>n's marches and pussy hats and empowerment and self-estem is that women are trying to convince the same men that they desire so desperately to be seen as \"equal to\" that women are better and smarter than men! And they do all this while being in need of constant and endless validation from men! I'm telling you, women are FUCKING RETARDED!!!",

YOU LOOK MASCULINE to men when you act that way and men find it very very unattractive.\n\nYou can go ahead an write all the blog posts, YouTube videos, shut down traffic for protests to tell men to think differently, it will NEVER WORK. Men look at women who sleep around the same: They serve ONE purpose and ONE purpose ONLY.\n\nSo if you<b>  are a</b> woman and you sleep around AND people know you do... THIS is why you can't KEEP a man. No man takes you seriously.\n\nYou can try to hide this ladies all you want but you are only damaging yourself, seeking out only the hottest, biggest dick, rich, etc and your standards will grow so high that you will never find a GOOD man who wants ONLY YOU, you will spend you life bitter because you can't get a hot, rich, big dick guy to STAY and the other \"average\" men aren't good enough anymore, on the eyes or in bed, you spoiled yourself and have no one else to blame but yourself.",

When women actually love, they just can't see anything else in another man. Their world revolves around that man. But all around me are men who honestly, genuinely love their partners, wives, girlfriends but still cheat. If you ask them why, they genuinely do not know why they just can't stop. And yet, they LOVE their partner. And I think everyone can agree that men and women do not cheat on the same scale at all. Infact, women cheating is a fairly recent phenomenon. It actually only blew up with the wave of feminine power that has really intensified in recent times.",

Do they have it together enough to vote in your opinion or not? \n\nI think when ideas like \"tradition<b> al gend</b>er roles\" are spoken about it sparks concern about regressing back to the past. I know some people want this without question and they'll let it be known. With others it remains unclear to me. \n\nI'll admit I have my biased having been raised by a strong, independ<b> ent wo</b>man who worked full time and raised three kids without a partner. So when I hear women NEED a man, it simply doesn't resonate.",

Nowadays, bedding her less than 24 hours after meeting her is just considered rounding first base. For young men who just want to pump & dump with no strings attached, these are grand times. For men who want more, these are bad times. I am part Vietnamese, so ALL six of my female cousins insisted I avoid American girls for marriage. They went so far as to go to Vietnam to look for a suitable traditional girl for marriage. <b> Crazy </b>enough, they found one and I am happily married to her along with a lifetime's supply of my favorite food....Pho! lol",

I don't say this to say men should sleep around, but those are just the facts. Many kids, including me, were not taught these things and had to learn the hard way to come to this knowledge.

I'm still friends with the last one but no romantic intentions from my side but he's still emotionally dependent on me. Currently I'm with a married person and I'm totally fine with it since I'm not interested in relationships and social conventions that come along with them (meeting parents, friends, birthday, presents and all the horrible stressful stuff). Still I would not sleep with someone I don't like and trust but I just don't feel heavily for anyone anymore. When you love someone you give them the power to hurt you.",

As follows.\n\nIf you're a great looking guy with the right traits in addition to great looks, you have the pick of the litter.  \n\nIf you're not a great looking guy and/or are missing the other 'traits' all women look for, you are desperate to get INTO a relationship to put an end to all the rejection.\n\nIn my experience, the only guys I know who want a relationship are tired of being rejected and figure if they get into a relationship that will solve a problem.\n\nThere've been times I was seeing 4 different women and none of them knew.  And there was no way I was going to enter a relationship. \n\nAnd besides the 'only losers are desperate for a relationship' issue, hookup culture is prevalent so there's that anti-relationship pressure too.\n\nVERY FEW of us these days want to get stuck with the same person for 6 months?  A year?  and miss out on all the variety in the bedroom.   \"I'll be sleeping with the same girl for HOW long?\"\n\nNo thank you.    \n\nIf a guy or gal wants to get married or in a LTR, they are either losers, lazy or hate variety and I doubt it's the latter.\n\n.\n.\n.",

Speaking from experience, not all guys that want a LTR are losers that haven't gotten laid. As a good looking guy in his early 20s, I've gotten laid PLENTY but i got bored of that lifestyle and feel like LTR is more sustainable and healthy.  \n\nMy advice to you is whether you agree with me or not: PLEASE DONT BE BITTER. Because the bitterness would only be a reflection of how you feel about yourself. Peace",

Never once did I watch tv or read the paper because there was a complete abundance of things to do so it was nearly impossible to get bored.  I played the piano, hiked, took 50 mile bike rides throughout the mountains, went rockclimbing, whitewater rafting, had bonfire parties, camped out, wrote stories, hitchhiked, swam in snowwater, played pool, took shrooms, and had encounters with wildlife that nearly got me killed.  Going back to the concrete jungle was hard since people are so materialistic, propagandized, redundant, stressed out, empty, and hellbent on instant gratification for the most part. People have lost their ability to communicate with others directly since they are so obsessed with social media which I tend to suck at fotunately.",

I for one would rather have the ability to assess a guy she is in a relationship with and if she thinks he is a drunken loser move on. Remember everyone puts their best foot forward in the beginning. Three months,  six months, even a year until the truth comes out. And you can come across a lot of losers before a winner comes through. There were a lot of females I dated for a short time, less than six months that I had to dump when their true colors came out. Women experience the same problem. There are a lot of Alpha posers running around luring young girls in and then the young women find out that guy was just another beta player out to get some. And those dudes are crafty especially with the petty women. They will play the game for weeks until they get what they want.  I know more than one case in which the player romance attractive women for weeks until he got what he wanted and turns out he is married with kids. Players are diabolical liars that young women fall prey to all the time.",

Men are supposed to be the leaders of this world. Whereever we go the women follow. If millenials continue to allow players to run unchecked and make heroes out of them. And pump them up as studs, instead of calling them out for the lying, dishonorable cheats they are. Then yes they will continue to spoil your pool of women. Your women will get further and further worthless. Young men of today were raised by women, so they don't have the balls to confront worthless men. They would rather take their frustrations out on women. They didn't have fathers around to teach them how to be manly. And deal with men that are screwing things up for their society.",

Thats like saying having no wife is a sin because Adam had one! 1 John 3:4, Romans 7:7 tells us what sin is, the law of God tells us what sin is and polygyny is lawful!\n\nAlso, the scripture you quoted in Titus is also referring to keeping your first wife! The word there that was translated to English is \"Mia\", which predominantly means FIRST. The point of the statement is that a teacher must know how to rule their home, not that they must have one wife! The writer (Paul, a teacher and apostle) was unmarried himself! So according to the nonsense you just stated he shouldn't be teaching! 2 Titus 3:10 is an example of the same greek word \"Mia\" being translated as \"First\". Because First= one when you are counting! You don't know what you're talking about",

Lamech was the first to take multiple wives.  He was the seed of Cain the wicked one.  Follow him if you want it's your choice but I will imitate God.  God has 1 wife which is his church so He intends for those who are His true children to have 1 wife.  Please don't be like what it says in Revelation 2: 9. I know your works and tribulation and poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy of those who declare themselves to be Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.  Some people say they are the true Hebrews but Jesus told the Jews 'you are of your father, the devil.'",

Even if the women is ugly there will be some desperate man waiting but it's not the same for the rest of the men who are not deemed attractive or whatever. There's lots of men who are not whores and will just sleep with an<b> y ol</b>d girl and usually those are the incels. Not justifying just responding back to your question.... I can speak for myself I don't ha<b> ve s</b>ex a lot with women and it's because I don't chase them. That's my personal choice but I know the women I'm friends with can h<b> ave </b>sex whenever they feel like it. They just need to go on IG and there's 3000 DM's from thirsty males. There is not a market like that for men... men on average with get 2-4 responses from women unless they are deemed hot. It's also factual that women will have more partners on average then any man so yeah....",

A fanatic Christian? A Mormon? Asexual? The peer pressure was unbelievable - and not from guys as much as from girls. There is something very wrong with that if you ask me. I have a happy marriage and a kid now, but looking at some of the girls I went to highschool with  - they are fucked up from shit they used to do. Or they are still doing it and the severity of it will hit them later.\nOn another note, I believe one can do a positive change forward. Although the damage of what you've done (e.g. sleep around, trea<b> t se</b>x as a tool to feed your own emptiness, etc.) cannot be undone - it's something you have to live with, one can always come to their senses and work on their issues, I believe. So videos like yours are a good wake up call.",

It annoys me that women are not allowed to do something that feels good and is fun just because men (and women who listen to them, like you) tell them they aren't allowed for no logical reason.\n\nIt annoys me off on a personal level. I have severely limited the number of people I've slept with in my lifetime probably because I wouldn't want to put a future partner off me. And yes, my current partner probably does appreciate that I haven't slept with dozens of other men. So I've actually inhibited my own happiness for some arbitrary status of \"purity\" that men have decided for women. It's not fair.",

I've also noticed this same attribute with several women I know who waited until marriage before they had <b> sex.</b> This amazing vividness and sparkle of life in their eyes. But women who sleep around with multiple men, they usually have cold, soulless eyes with no warmth or human connection in them. Its really kind of creepy in a way.\n\nI remember hearing an East European girl talk about how shocked she was at the level of promiscuity amongst American women. She said something very interesting that I'll never forget. She said that its no wonder why most American women have no light left in their faces because they are so<b>  promiscuous</b>. I also remember something very interesting that <b> a woma</b>n who used to work as a stripper once said. She said that if a girl works as a stripper for too long, it changes their eyes and their eyes become soulless. So I guess its true what they say? The eyes really are the windows to a persons soul.",

It seems like cognitive dissonance to me. So for all the girls who might be reading this, here's a little helpful advice. First of all, you need to stop reading those trashy, feministic women's magazines like \"Marie Claire\" \"Cosmopolitan\" and whatever other feminist rags you read. The only thing those disgusting women's magazines ever do is make women believe that by turning yourself into a walking sperm urinal for indiscriminate men is somehow empowering and liberating. \n\nAnd secondly, you need to stop reading all other forms of female oriented porn such as \"50 Shades of Gross\" and other female masturbation material. And if you have a so called \"little friend\" such as a vibrator or a rubber penis, you need to throw those things away and stop playing with yourselves! We've already had at least one blue haired feminist in this comment section who engaged in the classical feminist tactics of deflection and projection by attempting to shame men. Feminists cant ever take criticism of any kind. So ladies, lets stop spewing this feministic diarrhea out of your mouths and try to accept some constructive criticism for once in your lives.",

Once I got to know her and figured out she was nuts, I left her alone. Then she spiraled round the cock carousel a few spins, ended up screwing around with me a bit, then she got with this washed up ex NFL running back who had temper issues and used to hit her. Then THAT DUDE gets shot and killed too!!!! Now she's just a used up cunt, her voice isn't even the same anymore and her eyes look like nobody's home. Her eyes started to get lifeless after the first boyfriend got murdered, now after the second guy, she's just a monotone zombie <b> bimbo.</b>",

They do not act naturally when it comes <b> to s</b>ex. People are influenced by whatever is the norm and act accordingly.\n\nSimple example: Over-consumption did not exist. Yet it occurs nowadays because it is part of our society and culture. People will act according to the constraints of legislation and the rules of society. Same <b> for sex</b>ual behavior. If you impose constraints on how <b> many se</b>xual partners are socially accepted, then most people will behave accordingly. If you let them live out their sexuality however they wish without any consequences then they will do that.\n\nMy point is<b>  that promis</b>cuous behavior seems to indicate that psychological and behavior consequences to arise in such people. As I mentioned earlier. Having multiple partners does correlate with increase in unhappiness, depression, higher divorce rates, higher chance of unwanted pregnancy, higher chance of STDs, higher change of being a single mother (which in itself usually produces children and later adults with psychological instabilities), etc.\n\nCasual hookup dating culture is fairly new and has to be taken with care. A civilized society can only function if we procreate and provide a healthy environment in which we can raise children. If promiscuity is an indicator that correlates with people being less capable of forming long lasting relationships (which my above mentioned correlations suggest), then that leads to a serious problem and we should not promote it and rather inform the upcoming youth about the dangers.\n\nPS: I do not buy your argument a<b> t all. </b>Sexual behavior is influenced by oversexualised media and whatever is prevalent in the culture. Friends with benefits relationships did not exist in the past, open relationships same thing. Oversexualised media actually does st<b> imulate</b> sexual behavior. Same for free internet porn culture. You imitate what you see in those videos. I've done this, some partners have demanded or complained about this. Etc.",

By interacting with someone for a long time we absorb a part of their temperament overtime. We get both the goods and the bads. Just like your parents can have influence on who you are and how you think even long after they are dead they are still with you. The thing is the more <b> promiscuous </b>means you have higher chances of dealing with many people who have deep rooted problems and unsolved issues (trying to escape their issues by being in relationships one after the other) and it adds up very fast and it all affects your psyche and your image of yourself. And we need to bear the burden of that. Especially if you are someone sensitive or with a lot of empathy and if you have a good memory it will stay with you a long time maybe forever. I see it more about something psychological than physical DNA although its hard to know what happens at the microscopic level and we are still making lot of discoveries about genetics and how it evolves over time. I'm curious tough even if those people pretend they are happy if they would want their children to have<b>  promiscuous</b> adult life or not. That would speak volume about their real feeling about the topic. Because we all find excuses to rationalize why we do what we do and why it's the right thing.",

I dont think anyone should be encouraged to just sleep aroun<b> d, s</b>ex will always be better with a trusted partner but also single men or women if they want to have abit of fun and are being safe then go for it. For alot of women they find they need that security of a relationship to enjoy it the most thats what I found and that is true for many women. I just have a hard time believing due to personal observations that women who have slept around are more damaged and struggle to have happy relationships in the future, because nearly everyone has slept around to some extent XD",

And yeah i dont really feel like you have to have this long list over partners,  hell i even talk about this with people and they were like,  \" wow have you only been with that few \"   :P      OH NO I GUESS I HAVE TO SLEEP AROUND MORE  OR HAVE MORE 2 MONTH RELATIONSHIPS  XD",

Men and women who sleep around do it because they are empty, they have not purpose or fulfillment for they live a hedonistic lifestyle, but life is more than just pleasure. It is suffering for what is right, and love is the most important thing. Many say to themselves that they love a person, but it is only lust just as many men and women who have multiple short term <b> sexual </b>hookups. But they lie. Love is more than physical. It comes from the pure and righteous Spirit of God. For without God you cannot truly love, for He made you with love, Tosca. There is a love greater than all that is on earth. Only Christ Jesus can give to you. Tosca, the Lord did protect you from the pain and hurt of such. Many of these people are haunted by their<b>  sexual</b> pasts that they cannot form a true relationship because Christ Jesus needs to be in the picture. God is calling you, Tosca.",

Two wrong, for the price of one.\n\n\n\"went to a poorly-ranked school and failed to get good grades,\"\n\nOuch! Some of my grades: 99% Physics, 92% Mathematics, 100% Drafting, and won an award in Computer Science.\n\n\n\"either didn't attend university or went to a poorly-ranked university,\"\n\nAlso had post-secondary education in Multimedia, Web Design, 3D Animation, and Photoshop to explore my more creative / artistic side\n\n\n\"have no real career and have a low income, interests include cartoon video games\"\n\nIs this what your little bastard son is or something? It's starting to look like possible projection of someone else you know. I don't play video games at all btw.\n\nBut here's the best part. I don't attempt to shame other people regarding superficial or materialistic things like where they live, what grades they get, what job they have, what education they had, etc. That's reserved for a shallow and devious hypergamous tarts like yourself.\n\n\n\"and possibly actual cartoons,\"\n\nI assume you mean watching cartoons? I don't watch TV, let alone cartoons. However, I wouldn't mind making cartoons (animated or stills, such as caricatures) since I can draw very well (realistic / portrait style). However, I have higher priorities at the moment.\n\n\n\"poor at cooking and not a fan of vegetables,\"\n\nAm I being demonized with veggies as a weapon now? lol. Seriously though, I like vegetables. In fact, I just had a mixed vegetable soup before coming back to the computer to write this response to you. But I'm not a malnourished decrepit vegan nutcase if that's where this is going. And I cook for myself, almost never eat any fast food. I'm also in shape, unlike the vast majority of \"Americans\". Not that I have anything against Americans per se, I'm just not into gluttonous fatties anywhere, since I take it as a sign of being very selfish. The only exceptions I will draw up, is if eating is a coping mechanism for child abuse, or something of that nature. Otherwise, selfish and greedy.\n\n\n\"envious of men who have greater success with women.\"\n\nHmmm\u2026 that's a toss-up. Perhaps only the men that women I like, happen to like instead. Or male porn stars. Certainly not stupid beta cucks raising other men's spawn like a low self-esteem sucker / ATM machine, like the vast majority. That to me is certainly not definitive of \"success\", quite the opposite. Neither is a porn star of course, but at least everyone knows the score in that scenario, because they're not being duped by women pretending NOT to be whores, before they get divorce raped in court later down the line when things go sour.\n\n\n\"How did I do?\"\n\nWell let's tally it up. You got one half right I'd say, and all the rest wrong. So that's 0.5 out of 7, which is about 7%. So you failed miserably, lol. Although I could give you bonus points for mentioning cartoons, since I did work for DC Comics and Marvel at one time.\n\nAt least my life isn't some satirical cartoon :-)",

Feminism, in the way it exists today, it does suck. this movement, I'm sure at first had good intentions, to make genders equal, not make men look less than women. So lets not forget why it exists in the first place. Same way men are mistreated, women have been mistreated. Only problem is that it is 'cool' nowadays to call yourself a feminist, thats what the media promotes, thats how <b> crazy </b>feminist women give a bad name to us women in general, just because your hate gives them more power and more means to show how much 'they are being oppressed'. This is just a non-ending loop. Some women's hate towards men give reason for men to hate women. You shouldn't fall into that trap.",

Ugh.....I think your going by whats being said here or live in Beverly hills for I have no problem getting women and I'm 5'10. You think too much into shit. Competition? I feel I have no competition nor do I give a shit what other men do. I'm in control of myself. The women you speak of that do that to men,  the men are most to blame. If they stopped drooling over the bitch in the beginning and watched for the little things like how she carried herself, how she dressed, if she gets herself something to drink and doesn't bring one for you , never offers to pay  and expects you to pay for everything, gives attitude for little shit, doesn't like you hanging out with your friends or family and makes a child like sad face trying to be cute in attempt to get you to do somthing. If she does Any one of those and still stayed with her like most of those dumbass dude did then they are guaranteed a life of misery. My bros and most friends  are married  they are all afraid of their wives.  They have to call to ask permission for shit.   In your head you have already convinced yourself its hopeless. Then just prepare on the day you die all you'll have left is regret.",

And there has to be consequences otherwise we are screwed.\n\nBut hey, call me the devils helper for talking about what's right and wrong. that makes sense.\n\nWanna know something?

Also <b> a promiscuou</b<b> >s wom</b>an will not be trusted as a monogamous partner and there is a very legitimate reason why female infidelity will be veiwed more negatively than male:A cheating man is betraying trust but a cheating wife is betraying trust AND potentially obliging a man to be parentally responsible for children who are not his.

It's true that women can easily achieve the score counts that very very few (shall we say) harding working males achieve. Women don't seem to understand how powerful they really are. men can chase and chase and chase but ultimately it's women who choose. This is why men need an environment in which they can compete and show their worth to prospective partners.",

Women are only walking upto men and agreeing with this, as lip service even now, because the level of damage has destroyed the availability of men, their own sons are turning from them in waves. They only have the ability to play lip service games after that, they have spent too long collaborating with gov and oligarchs and now laws, police policies, employment quotas, hr policies and more are in place everywhere weaponising women raised as 'humanist' feminists by the school system are everywhere. They are completely weaponised. They are all on the spectrum.\n\nHowever perhaps there are a few that might get obsessed about what happened to get to this line and now actually genuninely do want to change, but most likely can't.  The extent to which women are confrontational and competitive now is like a taste of freedom for the dark parts of the personality. On top of which this conditioning was done in our developmental years in the school system. It would take decades to iron out most of it. Women have <b> zero </b>motivation for that with universal credit and social scoring systems around the corner.",

Now I think there is some truth to that, but the way they exaggerate shit turns it more into a big lie, just like men have done for eons of time. It's sad to see a weakminded girl like the one in the video to so easily go along with this, because there are some other aspects the right speaks of that is more truthful.  Re the 'irrational' thing, I find it quite ironic that these men's obvious irrational fear of women having too much power in society is what they are so unaware of all the while claiming they are purely rational. I think there is a difference between feminine (emotional) intelligence / energy and masculine (logical) intelligence/energy, but that does not mean that you do not possess any amount of the other <b> gender'</b>s energy/intelligence based on your<b>  gender</b>, neither are you purely rational because you're male.

Possible sign of self-sabotage behaviors. May foolishly think a bad partner is perfect not seeing their flaws. Thinking the grass is greener elsewhere kind of)\n2- lack of patience (may bail on you asap. as we have everything 1click away in our pocket mentality)\n3- lack of self awareness (we have less real alone time to think as we sink in our phone as soon as we have a minute. The person may be unwilling to face their demons and admit their flaws to keep living in a self-made bubble)\n4- lack of solving real-time problems as they happen (messy situations of normal daily relationship life will get messier and snowball. instead of fixing it and building a more solid relationship overtime it will be more and more fragile and ready to break)\n\nThat's not the kind of person anyone would want to build lifelong plans around. It's all possible to be improved and worked on but the person needs to be humble and willing. It can't be pushed on them it has to come from intrinsic motivation. It can take a decade. And it takes the right ressources and the right quality information.\n\nI think it's easy to observe that kids aren't taught how to nurture relationships and how to work through things, because even most adults they interact with these days don't know how. Most teachers have empathy but the emotionnal intelligence may not be as high as in say psychologists or executive management. People with high IQ usually have other profitable things to do other than teach kids as it's not valued in our society neither with money not status so highly qualified people move to more rewarded endeavoes. Back to my other point.. a generation before people used to repair their household items and things were built solid to last a lifetime, now it's all filmsy plastic we throw it away and buy new cheap ones as soon as there's a tear in it. Same behavioral habits got into relationships and friendships it seems.\nMaybe communications was easier back in the day when the world was less complex. There was 10 different jobs, the world revolves around maybe 100 people or less within 20km radius. now people are no better at communicating but we have to think about global issues and not offending 1/10000 people and think how everything we say and do will be perceived 20years from now. I think adults are even more childish nowadays but the need for communication skills has never been as important. it seems we haven't caught up with needs of the times we live in. We aren't taught how to have conversations most conversations we see use a broken model used for media manipulation and mass communication, not meaningful one on one problem solving and 2-way win-win negociations we see most communication of people trying to dominate or looking down on others instead of same level.",

Picking the marital partner is more about logic than attraction.\n\nA man who is in charge of his life will decide to marry because he wants to have children with someone who can pair bond with him long term; a <b> woman </b>who has never even had the urge to \"try\"<b>  sex</b> with different types of men. This is so the family unit structure that he is creating will have less likelihood of breaking apart.\n\nAnyway, many men categorize women in the dating market in two types: those who are good to fuck only, or those who would be a good, stable, loving mother. Being fuckable is easier than being the mother qualit<b> y woma</b>n, because it requires less personality attributes.",

If a<b>  woman</b> says yes with no commitment, then the men generally lose longterm interest unless they are already hopelessly in love (but they will nevertheless be internally conflicted). In the jungle they would walk away. After all, the whole point is reproduction, and they are looking for a qualit<b> y woma</b>n, and a good mother. They don't wish to devote resources to bringing up children with a girl that did not have the good sense/self-control/inner-strength to secure commitment. She isn't quality, she won't produce quality children, and she won't say no to her own children, to external threats, to tribal elders, or to her own self. They say that a person's success can be measured by how many difficult conversations they are willing to have. She won't be having difficult conversations unless it's forced on her.  A man hearing \"no\" is crucial to a longterm relationship. \nSo then the other half of this is how women select men. I don't know much about that, but I can confirm th<b> at promiscuo</b>us women are of no longterm interest to most men.",

Good is that women should get a good education and face no discrimination for jobs, resulting in them not being financially tied to men who treat them badly. Bad is the idea that women should look or behave the same as men, suppressing natural differences. Once such difference relates to sexuality and self worth, as your video has wisely identified.\n\nBTW, how is Yana? Have the two of you ceased to be friends?",

                    "commentText": "@alb12345672 Sorry for the late reply, Youtube didn't give me a notification. I agree with everything you said. Actually celibacy was practiced as a form of birth Control in north-west Europe by those born inside the Hajnal Line. Europe actually has had a tradition of <b> sexual </b>discipline, for both men and women, and its part of the way Europe was able to build wealth, by having a manageable population. \n\nIn the Tudor times in England contraception was banned and abstinence during marriage was practiced to limit the population. Imagine that! Today that would be unheard of, but most don't know European history. Plato himself stated that the highest good was not physical love, but Platonic love. All animals can perform the physical<b>  sex</b> act, but only human beings are able to express complex thoughts through dialogue.  \n\nSexuality in the media is simply pandering to the lowes<b> t commo</b>n denominator. I don't mean to be a snob, but you have a much better connection with t<b> he wom</b>an when she is on your intellectual level. And the marriage will last longer and be more stable, wit<b> h a wo</b>man that has discipline.",

Its the first round of education and socialisation in the education system, later combined with the media, and other wise backed by their parents (one of which is government). Brainwashing or 're-education' comes after that. This is built on the periods that children are 'neuroplastic' or in their 'developmental' phases. Everything in these groups likes feminism, antifa, weathermen, whatever is built on the conditioning done in primary school as per 'prussian public school program'.",

Even in marketing companies try to make a great impression on young customers so they are hooked for life and don't consider a competitor. Cellphone companies want you on a contract (or now pay out an expensive phone) or even a postpaid  plan so you are less likely to leave. Once people see choice they move on.  A <b> woman </b>that can get unlimited<b>  sex</b> on Tinder is unlikely to be faithful.\n\nAs  always your mileage will vary.  But I look at real world numbers. Birth rates (according to the gov't BTW) are below replenishment. Recent statistics came out. Th<b> e ag</b>e of marriage creeps up (some may say this is a good thing, but it also means MANY less are not getting married), less get married period, divorces are on the rise. MGTOW has thousands of ardent followers, would be unheard of even 20 years ago. I could see older guys but many of the comments are guys that aren't even 18. Women and men today are ADVERSARIAL due to feminism. Many don't understand exactly what that means. If a cop in the US pulls you over,  and you talk to him, he has to ignore and never repeat anything that could make you seem innocent. Anything that can be construed as guilt, even in the slightest, is used against you. When women take on a feminist role they operate the same way. Everything a guy does is held against them. Guys are afraid even to compliment women for ramifications. Feminist women take on the ma<b> le sexu</b>al role and look for a conquest of partners. Their biology don't work that way, however. Women don't get off from porn the same way men do. It would almost be like men buying romance novels and getting worked up over them. It just don't really work that way.\n\n There are more non married adults than ever before. There is a major movement of alternative sexuality that does not favor procreation.\n\n There is something to see here. The bible and laws were created because humans have serious flaws. Those rules (premari<b> tal </b>sex) were created to keep people in check, give them shame, etc. Now that is all gone. Your wife can cheat on you and it is really no big deal anymore.",

                    "commentText": "Technically accurate but implies a causal relationship in a dynamic that is far more complex. Furthermore, \"successful marriage\" implies something that isn't really accurate. The absence of divorce should not in and of itself constitute a \"success.\" I woukd contend that marriage endinf in divorce is much more successful than a marriage that endures abuse. \n\nWith those caveats aside, the group's with the highest divorce rates are women with more than 10 <b> sexual </b>partners and women with 2<b>  sexual</b> partners prior to marriage. If there were a clear line of causality that more = divorce, the 3-9 cohort would reflect an increase compared to 2 partners.\n\nAnd while both 0 and 1 partner have lower divorce rates, this is readily explained by two factors: 1) virgin marriage is associated with religion which not only stigmatises pre-martia<b> l se</b>x but also stigmatises divorce. The data show this religoous relationship to be accurate. Additionally, those who enter a marriage with children from a prior relationship have lower rates of reported marital satisfaction than those who do bit have children, and those with 1 previous partner were less likely to have a child.\n\nOverall, there is simply insufficient evidence available to conclude that the increase in partbers causes higher rates of divorce. It is just as likely abd perhaps even more likely that the characteristics which lead one to have more than 10 partners also affect marital stability. All in all, there's no reason to drift back to stigmatising pre-marit<b> al s</b>ex and no support for the myth of diminished pair bonding.",

You are falling victim to perceive spurious correlation. In advance of replying to you, I did the research to confirm whether or not there was evidence to support your claim. The data show that 0-1 = lowest divorce rate; 2 = highest divorce rate; 3-9 = second lowest rate; 10+ = highest rate.\n\nWere your statement accurate, the order from lowest to highest would be 0-1, 2, 3-9, 10+. Instead, the order is 0-1, 3-9, 2 & 10+ (tied). This indicates that there are other variables besides number of partners that imply a causal function. All this means is that certain demographic members likely have certain characteristics which affect BOTH number of partners and likelihood of divorce but that in and of itself affects both INDEPENDENT of one another.\n\nAnd what on earth do you assert constituted poisoning the well? You've asserted a false claim and been dismissive and rude while asserting matters as \"biological truth\" despite that assertion being false.\n\nI also offered to provide links to studies so you can analyse the statistics yourself.

Also everything after \"worldview\" was just extra words that didn't need to be there. You are so clueless, do you actually think women could beat men in a war? It's not narcissism or grandiosity, it's fact that men would dominate in that scenario. Go watch some history and see what the lives of women used to be, y'all don't even know how good you got it now.\n\nI wouldn't call it rage, I call it a realistic world view when the SHTF. I know I would survive from bush craft training, survival preparedness, learning how to live without the power grid, skilled in hunting, fishing, trapping, weapons, shooting, stealth and a host of other skills needed to survive the wild elements.\n\nIn this world most of us are indoor cats, we can't even get our hair wet without complaining.

That's what happens when pathetic betas are backed into a corner though, all you have left is name calling. I stated facts, you got <b> pussy </b>hurt. \n\nAm I bitter towards women? Sure maybe a little, or maybe I just stopped jumping through hoops for y'all. Women constantly complain about men not being men anymore and guess who killed the manly man? Women. I'm taking it back the only way I know how and I'm not going to let any women put me down or tell me what to do anymore. \n\nI'm 100% sober living in my own house, working for Enbridge, I don't need help, I give help.

I think women KNOW that they are picking bad mates, but are pretending to not know. To prove that is true, how do you explain how women are able to pick up on nice guys with pretty much 100% accuracy, and weed them out early, in search of the players and bad boys? Do you really think an intelligent person believes that you can be that great at recognizing nice guys, while being woefully unable to pickup on players and bad boys? It's BS. Men are onto your game. That's why the MGTOW guys, incels, and all of those guys are often harsh when they speak to you. They know you are not honest about what you like, and what turns you on. It's not nice guys.\n\nThe reality is that the overwhelming majority of women want bad boy <b> sex,</b> but they don't want to be judged for it, so they pretend that they \"don't know\" that the guys they're dating/chasing are players or bad boys. But, you DO know, and men KNOW that you know. The dishonesty is the biggest issue.",

In reality, EVERY guy is ALL of these things...just some are a little more of one than the other at a given time. You exposed your disdain for nice guys by saying that a<b>  woman</b> shouldn't date a nice guy just because he's nice (which I never said that they should), but a decen<b> t woma</b>n WOULD choose a nice guy over a player or a bad boy every time, if she's a sane, logical individual. This last comment exposed your hatred for nice guys again by calling them fraudulent. There's no bigger fraud than a player or bad boy. It's not even a real thing. It's a persona that guys create because they know that most women are attracted to it, and it's used to get a lot of cheap, ea<b> sy s</b>ex from whores and slutty women. No guy is born a player, or bad boy. All men start out as nice guys when they are young, and life experiences (past failures, and seeing what works for other guys in society) causes them to adapt throughout life. I'm speaking from experience. I'm a seasoned guy who has been all 3 (nice guy, bad boy, and player) at different points in my life. When you put on both the player and bad boy persona, women almost trip over themselves trying to date and/or sleep with you, and when you recognize this, it makes you dislike them, because you realize how screwed up they are. They're basically bad people. When you're the nice guy, you tend to attract the sweet, nerdy girls, country girls, church girls (not the fake ones...the true ones), and girls raised in stable, two-parent homes.",

I would like to watch that video you put up though but I understand that might be out of the question. Can't be that bad? Edit: I agree that the message sent to women go against what is truly good for them in general. There might be very few exceptions though.",
