This is what trans activists do \u2013 this is how they silence women.', '\u201cI hope people wake up to what is going on.\u201d', 'She added: \u201cI wanted it to be a conversation starter but this is a new level of absurd. I find it far more sinister and pernicious than the old-fashioned sexism where the guy at the garage is surprised I know anything about engines.', '\u201cI\u2019d take that any day over the Twitter troll who thinks I don\u2019t know what a woman is. But Dr Harrop, 31, of Sunderland, whose complaint led to the poster\u2019s removal last week, said the billboard was a \u201csymbol that makes transgender people feel unsafe\u201d.', 'He also accused Primesight of being complicit in \u201cthe spread of transphobic hate speech\u201d.', 'But the firm said it was unaware of the motive behind the campaign and would be taking it down.', 'In a statement, Primesight said: \u201cAt first glance, this copy did not raise a red flag the way it should have done.', '\u201cHands up, we have been misled by this campaign\u2019s messaging.', '\u201cWe are proud to support the LGBTQ+ community and remain fully committed to equality for all.\u201d', 'Dr Harrop, a blogger who is not transgender but describes himself as an \u201cally\u201d, said: \u201cIt really is not the dictionary definition itself, it is the motivation behind it.', '\u201cThat poster creates an environment for hostility for transwomen and makes them frightened.\u201d', 'He denied that he was depriving Mrs Keen-Minshull of free speech, saying: \u201cShe has freedom of speech but so do I.\u201d', 'But some took to Twitter yesterday to disagree.', 'Jonathan Brimicombe posted: \u201cThat someone is offended by a common noun just shows the offended person has more than noun issues to deal with, even if they are yet to realise it.\u201d', 'George Henry Newman added: \u201cSo if a trans person put one up and someone complained and it was removed we have the LGBT saying it is a attack on them.', '\u201cPeople don\u2019t have to agree to your views, it\u2019s called \u2018freedom of speech\u2019 [and] it works both ways.\u201d', 'And user Lynette Lock tweeted: \u201cBonkers simply bonkers. There must be people literally waiting and watching for something to complain about.\u201d",
