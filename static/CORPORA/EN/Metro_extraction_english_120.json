        "postText": "It\u2019s been roughly 200 years since performers started \u2018blacking up\u2019 to mock enslaved African Americans and surprisingly it\u2019s still a thing today.', 'Despite numerous headlines about why it\u2019s so hurtful, drunken students, and parade organisers still keep finding themselves in hot water over the troubling practice.', 'Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has now been forced to apologise for a yearbook photo showing him in \u2018brownface makeup\u2019 at an Arabian Nights themed party in 2001.', 'As the Liberal Party leader conceded: \u2018Yes it was. I didn\u2019t consider it racist at the time, but now we know better.\u2019', 'Before anyone jumps in to say \u2018it\u2019s just a bit of fancy dress\u2019 or \u2018it\u2019s political correctness gone mad\u2019, it\u2019s worth learning about the history of blackface to understand just how offensive it is.', 'White performers started blackening their faces with burnt cork or shoe polish for minstrel shows in 1830s New York.', 'They wore ragged clothing, painted wide and red lips on themselves and imitated Africans forced to work in southern slave plantations.', 'Historian Dale Cockrell said the shows were popular with working class white people who felt \u2018squeezed politically, economically, and socially from the top, but also from the bottom\u2019.', 'They peaked as hostility grew after slavery was abolished following the American civil war and black people started demanding civil rights.', 'In other words the shows were a form of punching down in which the audience were made to feel better about themselves by laughing at stereotypes of lazy, buffonish and ignorant African Americans.', 'The idea was conjured up by New York born actor Thomas Dartmouth Rice, known as the \u2018Father of Minstrely\u2019, who reportedly drew inspiration for his Jim Crow character from slaves he saw in the southern states.', 'US State and local segregation laws which running from the late 1800s to 1965 were even known as Jim Crow Laws, after the stage character.', 'The idea of white performers painting their face black actually stretches back to old productions of Shakespear\u2019s Othello, but blackface has become more closely associated with American minstrel shows which really emphasised hurtful portrayals of Africans.', 'Many years later the performances made their way into radio, TV shows and movies, with the likes of Shirley Temple, Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney blacking up.', 'Blackface soon caught on in other countries including Britain, where the Black and White Minstrel Show only finished in 1978.', 'Blackface \u2018allows society to routinely and historically imagine African Americans as not fully human. It serves to rationalise violence and Jim Crow segregation,\u2019 says David Leonard, a professor of comparative ethnic studies and American studies at Washington State University.', 'In a 2012 essay for the Huffington Post, he said: \u2018Blackface is part of a history of dehumanization, of denied citizenship and of efforts to excuse and justify state violence.', '\u2018From lynchings to mass incarceration, whites have utilized blackface (and the resulting dehumanization) as part of its moral and legal justification for violence.\u2019', 'He said the very idea of blacking up is far too loaded to ever be brushed off as a harmless bit of fun.', 'Mr Leonard says blackface still helps to reinforce racist views about black people being dangerous criminals or lazy unemployed people which many still hold today.', 'The practice has been extended to other minority ethnic people, hence Trudeau using \u2018brownface\u2019 as a character of a an Arabic man.', 'Leonard also argues it doesn\u2019t matter if you think it\u2019s not racist or if you had no idea it could be seen as racist.', 'He added: \u2018The ability to disparage, to demonize, to ridicule, and to engage in racially hurtful practices from the comfort of one\u2019s segregated neighborhoods and racially homogeneous schools reflects both privilege and power.\u2019', 'Other variations of blackface including Zwarte Piet, or \u2018Black Pete\u2019, a Christmas character in the Netherlands, are often defended as a form of historical tradition.', 'But anti-racism campaigners still say the mischievous sidekick of Sinterklaas who kidnaps naughty children and takes them to Spain, still promoted harmful stereotypes.', 'Founder of podcast festival ShoutOut network Imriel Morgan told Metro.co.uk she remains \u2018astounded at the level of ignorance\u2019 about donning blackface for Halloween parties.', 'She added: \u2018The reality is that if you\u2019re a non-black person you have the privilege and luxury of not having to deal with all of the biases the world places on black and brown skin.', '\u2018Chances are your skin tone isn\u2019t automatically viewed as suspicious, you\u2019re not perceived as lazy until proven otherwise, or labelled disruptive or as a class clown because you have learning difficulties.', '\u2018So when we say painting yourself black is racist, we\u2019re not saying it to be difficult or to \u2018play the race card\u2019, it\u2019s to acknowledge the fact that the very act of doing so reinforces these baseless mythical assertions about blackness and our skin\u2019s ability to override our humanity.\u2019",

You have to look at intentions behind something not just accuse someone of being prejudice when there's is no proof that they are. This is causing division when there's no need.",

Over and over the message is put out that this is a problem. People must accept that. There are a million costumes to choose for Halloween or fancy dress, why not pick one that doesn\u2019t have this type of history attached to it?",
