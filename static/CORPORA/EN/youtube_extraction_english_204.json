But no our ancestors are immigrants from Asia, Europe, etc but we are not true Canadians and Americans we are still immigrants and why not that man go back where his ancestors were born before they moved to Canada. Because Canada and America belonged to the First <b> Nation </b>people the Aboriginals. I don't care what the rest of you guys say because if you need to go back in your family tree to understand better of your family and read the history and understand how the lands was taken over and how the first<b>  nation</b> people were treated.",

The first stages of this is depopulation and the slow down of white births and the increase of the deaths by white men and women. The hilarious part about all of this is that this entire situation has been set in motion by other white MEN and WOMEN in politics throughout history. This will be a slow and painful destruction of very people that oppressed all of these immigrants in the past. God works in mysterious ways indeed.",

They are in a constant line to get into Europe or any country that has been built by white people. Indians are indeed intelligent and could build a wonderful <b> nation </b>but their problem is, is they have completely over-populated their country. It might sound harsh but if they were to stop a generation or two from being able to produce, except for their most brilliant people, then, I have no doubt that they would be a force to be reckoned with and their country would boom, meaning that they wouldn't have to infiltrate others to survive. The same goes for places like China. It's been proven that Asians are smarter than whites but they cannot build great societies because of their constant populating.",

            "commentText": "I find it vile and appalling that some people, the videographer in this instance, don't seem to understand that in Canada, people have a legal right to privacy yet the man being verbally assaulted seems to think it was his right to stick his nose into another person's business which he should have been smart enough to stay out of. He brought the verbal abuse upon himself yet now he is acting like Mr. Innocent when his interference in another man's business simply begged the white guy to tell him off. \n\nThe videographer was told before this yelling ever started, to mind his own business and stop filming him. The videographer refused. Charges in this instance would be a travesty of justice but guess what the police just did.........Disgusting!!!!!!! This is Canada and we have laws concerning people's rights, behavior and interaction but most people don't know nor understand those laws and they surely don't respect them. I hope our judges do, but recent history has proven that they don't either as they ignore legislated law and change them to suit what they think rather than substantiating what law states. We are one sick <b> nation </b>of little God wannabees, making up our own rules as we go along and flaunting our long legislated laws as antiquated nonsense.  \n\nI wonder why<b>  nothing</b> has been said about how this altercation started. It seems the owner of a parking lot decided he had the right to charge for parking and had his employee block this man's truck to get his pound of cash when the abuser was simply using his driveway to turn around on a busy street. In other words, if you step foot on my property, you owe me money. That too is a breach of Canadian law unless there is a obviously visible sign at the entrance stating that \"entry constitutes a minimum parking fee\".  YouTube seems to be becoming Canada's new legislature for all the little God Wannabees and money worshiping idolaters. If this supposed Asian man was born in Canada, his ignorance of our laws should be grounds for removal of his citizenship.",

Black people invariably have problems all over the world with prejudice and poverty, no matter where we go, however, extremely ancient cultures of totally relentless predators know that, people only have problems from themselves and can only be highly precisely tracked and targeted by people who are exactly like themselves... In this case, by Brown People, whom we no longer rec<b> ognize</b> as Black People.\n\nIn my research of human geographical history, it has become crystal clear to me that, at some point in human history there was a great ideological divide that occurred among Africans Over Tyrannical, Iron Fisted Control Over Humanity or Total Human Freedom that occurred in The Horn of Africa Reg<b> ion of T</b>he African Continent at some point in human history, that still rages on today.\n\nIndians and Pakistanis have been expell<b> ed from </b>The African Continent many times over again throughout both known and unknown human history and not only do these former Africans want a<b> ccess to</b> The African Continent, they want total control of it, even if it takes Religious Indoctrination, Hyper-industrialization, Media Bashing, Military Invasion (including <b> highly cov</b>ert terrorist infiltration) or Economic and Technological Hypnotism.\n\nIn my long ago concluded analysis, Nigeria was chosen because it it is a direct competitor to Kenya, which very conveniently has a Huge Influx of Indians and Pakista<b> nis, </b>just like Nazi Germany <b> and its</b> Ancient Indian Caste System based Class System,  Swastika and Aryan Ideology, Middle Eastern Terrorism, North American Terrorism, Chechnya in Eastern European Terrorism or anywhere else that has experienced historically uncharacteristic flareups of Terrorism.\n\nIndians have been able to accomplish this by surviving for multiple human civilizations and creating complete global resets by wiping out the vast majority of humanity in repetitively staged and executed global human Armageddonous resets of human civilizations during which Indians and Pakistanis relentlessly collect as much global human technol<b> ogy, st</b>ore it in Indian Libraries and re-release it during multiple human civilizations and thereby very successfully making themselves look li<b> ke a </b>global super race, when in fact they are just thieves.\n\n [LINK] ",

Unless you are a native, member of six nations, ojibwe etc etc. Your are an<b>  immigrant</b>.\n2. I dont care if youve been in this country dating back to some of the first settlers ,like my family or you got sworn in yesterday. We are equal and all citizens of this great country and all it has to offer. \nBoth my grandparents and both my great grandparents fought in both world wars, does that mean im more entitled than a family from Syria that emigrated last year. NO, My grandfather believed that this country needs to be a beacon of hope for those oppressed around the world, a safe haven, a second chance at life and all the rights and freedoms that come from being Canadian + hockey. .this guy is anti Canadian he is the exact opposite of what this country represents.  I know Canada is far from perfect, just look a Trudeau,  but i BELIEVE its the best country in the world and its the immigrants thats made it what it is. CANADA I LOVE YOU.",

So i can understand why he is angry. But i never insulted somebody and i respect people. Bring people like 50 000 from a country when you dont have any <b> indian </b>citizens, or Muslims, or<b>  black</b>, or chinese or others in your country i can understand. But there are too many strangers in the country and it is the destruction very slowly but surely of what the canada should be. For example, in canada, i find chinese people are too many. When i was in canada in 2001, it was great. The repartition was correct. Now, chinese people are everywhere. They are buying everything they can. And more and more and more are coming. A lot of refugees or nationalities dont talk english or french. Not at all. It brings communication problems and stress. Some of them dont want to accept the life style and live like if they were in africa....or with tradition of the native country in question..... Just here for money. So now they are here ok. We have to respect them because we are humans but multiculturalism brings absolutel<b> y nothin</b>g except people living in group. They dont mix them and they create \"clans\" in the city. Its tota<b> ly cra</b>zy because its like if they wanted to say....hey canada, i want to be citizen but finaly, they stay together talking together, living together...and just mix for the job...thats shit. Its like a state, in a state. If i want to see indians...chinese, ara<b> bs, bl</b>ack or other people, i pay a travel and i go in holidays. The worst is that all government accept them and bring them in the country because\"main d'oeuvre\" is needed and reproduction. But for me, i prefer 30 000000 people in a country than 38 000000. Never forget that all humans come from earth, but come from separated countries... countries which have been built by humans themselves.",

Canada the US are European based people created countries and they just do not want to give away their country. These so called racists or more true to there nature,\"rebels\", know that there country has been prostituted out by there own politicians. Many European based immigrants over the history of Canada and the US had to go through grueling immigration practices; non European based people do not.\nThe US is going through H-1B visa, the lie here is that the US citizens are not intelligent enough to do the work, but in reality these people work for much less, so they come here and steal the jobs. The H-1B visa is about to come to an end in the US; its about time.\nThe liberal liars out in the socialist world would say this man hates, in this case, the India based man because of the way he looks. This is not true they do not like this invader not because his aesthetics but because he knows his own politicians hav3e sold out their own people. \nI am not a <b> racist </b>I can never go to another man and say this kind of crap, but once the civil war comes and it will come, I will side with a traditional view and protect my country of origin; the good ole USA.

Pride is healthy in moderation, but to be so arrogant merely for being born a certain way or in a certain place, purely by coincidence, and to be blinded by this misplaced sense of pride to the extent that it manifests in the very incarnation of that sin, this seething rage, reveals his place in the lower rung of this hierarchy. More so, his discontent with his place. Remedial words come from remedial minds. I'm sure he'd be more than happy to scream \"shitskin\" my way. Meanwhile, I was born with a relatively high IQ, am quite the achiever, and am thusly worthier of this life by any reasonable standard. It isn't as if I'm proud simply for being born more intelligent than most, either.\n\nTry actually achieving something instead of harassing people, lest you be among the first cretins on the chopping block when it comes time to see who truly does better than whom and in which ways. That time is just around the corner. Automation will wipe out most of the low level service industries, and in that time he will assume his most hated form; the dreaded leech. The drain on society. Those like him usually aren't capable of anything more, that's why they beg for job handouts from the gubbamint when menial labour has no place in the first world anymore.",

            "commentText": "This guy is an idiot but all you un-Canadian trash in the comment saying European families are immigrants. Our Forebears were immigrants here. We are generational Canadians. We built a country here. I'm sorry Native Americans for bringing our diseases, that sucked but no one knew the science of diseases and it wasn't ever intentional, the \"blanket giving\" myth has been debunked a billion times over by credible historians. Europeans didn't steal your country from you, YOUR FOREBEARS signed treaties with ours in order to set up colonies, there never was one Native American group, they were seperated into tribes, most of which were completely isolated from each other. You can't say that the natives of Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Island) have any claim to Moosekudoboogwek (Nova Scotia) they were completely different tribes with different dialects and different cultural customs, albeit they came from the same genetic stock. Just goes to show what happens when people don't fully educate themselves and they get spoon-fed information their whole lives.\nAll I want is a Canada that takes immigration and borders seriously and for my countrymen to be well educated so we may prosper and overcome our own tragedy, so we may adequately help others overcome theirs. Letting in the whole world doesn't solve any problems, it creates them. People are the problem solvers and we need to have a country that isn't so confusing that no one inside it can understand it. We need to feel like we are part of something bigger than us, not something intangible but something within our grasp, something we can hold onto and say; \"this is where I draw the line\" my family, my home, my community, my neighbourhood, my city, my province, my <b> nation,</b> these are the things I have within my grasp and these are things that I must hold onto so that my family, my brothers and sisters and countrymen are not beset by the tragedy. The last generation was beset by tragedy, not this one. We learn from the mistakes of forebears and we shoulder the responsibility. I have a country here of generational Canadians, we have Polish and Ukrainian, Native American, French, Scottish, English, Irish, German and Dutch and many other European, Asian and East Asian denominations, if you took the time to go through the properly established methods of obtaining citizenship than you ARE my countrymen, we are a European<b>  Nation</b> in our philosophy, we strive to overcome the suffering of life. Native Americans are our countrymen and any of you un-Canadian traitors who want to tear apart our relationships with our countrymen in the workplace, at home, in public, YOU ARE A DISGRACEFUL GIT. \nThis comment section makes me want to be sick now, bye bye.",

Do you realise the majority of welfare dependents in Canada are White? Unemployment is a choice for many who have the capacity to work. Minorities will take what they can get. You walk into a Tim Hortons and see that young cashier taking your order for $14 and hour. Probably renting a room in a basement apartment somewhere. Alberta and BC has the highest minimum wage rates in the country. She's probably completing her degree in Finance at the same time. Situations are temporary money is money. Construction workers can make $25 an hour in the tar sands. There's really an excuse here when someone is born in this country that has a list of resources to aid adults in joining the workforce. White people born and raised in Canada have the privilege of a Western education and programs that are funded through public services. Move where there are jobs, seek employment agencies. I know too many immigrants from Africa and Asia who have entered the country broke as shit only to get there shit together after years of hard work and education. You don't even need a degree to work in the trades depending on your position.",

Canada has a deeply rooted <b> racism </b>that is festering underneath like a volcano waiting to erupt. People are not allowed to discuss these feelings openly for fear of social labelling and ostracizing, but you can rest assured that the majority of Canadians discuss these feelings at home in small towns, in doughnut shops, at hockey practice what is becoming of their country. Canadians are just silent and polite people but deep down are very aware of this immigration con job that has been going on for 50 years now.",

Since India was part of the British Raj, logically inhabitants of that country should have the freedom to immigrate to Britain's other colonies. There was a time where Indians were able to freely immigrate to other British colonies all across the world because they were citizens of the British Empire.

Any man who\n says that he is a Canadian, but tires to impose his/her customs and \nhabits upon us, is not a Canadian. We only have room for one flag, the \nCanadian flag. There is room or only two languages here, English and \nFrench. And we have room for loyalty, but only one, loyalty to the \nCanadian people. We won't accept anyone, I'm saying anyone who will try \nto impose his religion or his customs on us,\" -1907",

Then they opened the doors for Southern Europeans Greeks,Italians and Portuguese. They were made fun off as well, but took it all in good stride and within a few years started fitting in well with the rest of the anglo and french population. During the 1970's,80's and 90's Canada's immigration policy drastically changed scope. Europeans were no longer deemed favorable immigrants to Canada so they decided to focus on other regions of the world mostly Asia and South America. In the late 80's immigrants from mostly India, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Hong Kong and China were the new places of interest for Canadian immigration. The problem most Canadians have with these people is that they don't want to blend in to our European christian culture and don't assimilate but rather separate into their own communes all at the same time demanding social services which  come into contrast with the already preexisting culture.  So of course Canadians of Anglo and European stock feel outraged and rightfully so. White Canadians are the real visible minorities in major cities like Toronto,Montreal and Vancouver when only 50 years ago that was not the case. Don't tell me we're all equal, when Toronto has over 300,000 immigrants of Asian descent and whole malls with their language on them. I have no problem with immigration per se, but not when it exceeds its limits. Their is a local culture and local customs and they should be respected not oh i can't shave off my beard because of religious reasons even though the boxing commission of Canada clearly states that fighters have to be clean shaven to protect from injury. Canada is constantly making appeasements for these \"new\"arrivals at the expense of the already existing culture.",

I'm tired of hearing the classic government mantra that  \" Canada needs immigrants because we have an unsustainable population\" when that is so not the case. What doesn't make sense is if Canada is the second biggest country in the world why are all the new arrivals concentrated specifically in those 3 big cities that i mentioned? I think there is a deliberate attempt to create social disorder,chaos and unhappiness, by forcing people to live in close proximity to people they have <b> nothing </b>in<b>  common</b> with, and stigmatizing and even endangering those that are in disagreement with the status quo.

He was a good dude, later I started working for him on his rental properties. He later retired,sold all his rental properties and moved to Las Vegas. He had a 3 bedroom house and told me I could come live with him if I wanted to. I probably should of took him up on the offer. ..My dad is dark hair/olive skinned of Mediterranean decent and my mom is blond/blue eyes pale white Northern Europe. My great great grandfather came to USA from Germany in the late 1800's..I look way more Norwegian (white) than olive skin Mediterranean. So if I wanted to immigrate & become a German citizen or citizen of a northern Euro country. I'd get denied even if I had savings,education,job prospects,could already speak the language, no criminal record,etc..But if I looked like my dad and showed up with no identification claiming to be from Iraq or somewhere else in the middle east I'd be far more likely to be granted citizenship  even though they have no idea who I am, where I came from or whether I'm a good or bad person.",

I guess what I'm trying to say is that of any people anywhere there are good people and there are bad people! I used my family as an example of what can happen when people are given a chance to flourish and grow with their newly adopted country! Like I said I am a 5th generation Lebanese Canadian. Although I'll never forget my roots I consider myself to be 100% Canadian and if worse ever came to worse I would gladly lay my life down to protect and defend this peace loving, responsible and welcoming<b>  nation</b> that has given me and my family all that we ever wanted! what also really makes me down right angry are the people coming in from the middle east and Africa who just want a free ride! What's wrong with working hard and integrating with society the way that my family did? What pisses me off even more are the free loaders (economic migrants) who are taking advantage of the Syrian epidemic and \"piggy backing\" on them to try and come in to my country, undocumented as u said and immediately go on welfare and take advantage of anything and everything they can! These people are crippling my local economy and who are the ones getting screwed? That's right the hard working Canadian tax payer! are these are exactly the people who give the majority of these immigrants who just want to work hard and send their kids to school a very bad name and are making it very hard for them! Isn't that always the way though? The majority is always at the mercy of what the minority is doing!",

All instigated by the USA and UK, all rebels against Assad at the current war are and were supported by the US and UK, they have then formed ISIS in Iraq (which were also destroyed by the USA, so that Halliburton can win billions of dollar to built up the country by the way, remember Dick Cheney, he was a director there), so these wars were supported by the US and UK, and thats the reason the wars were so prolonged that created all these millions of refugees going to Europe! Blame your government for all the sufering of the refugees and also the people of Europe who have to contend with extra people, but lets not forget, the countries surrounding Syria took most of the refugees, Lebanon alone took more than 2 million, Europe 1 million+, a lot less. Turkey also took in more than a million. Lybian refugees started after the US killed Khadaffi who was good to his people, he built free healthcare, cheap water installations in the deserts, it was that he wanted the West pay in gold for their oil, that he was killed (and not as the western media tells you, because he supported terrorism, he supported freedom fighters)",
