        "postText": "'The Chase veteran Mark Labbett, 53, referred to the remarks made by Twitter users as everyday sexism after he revealed he had never been urged to leave the show. Jenny, 37, who is widely known as The Vixen, shut down a troll who said her performance on a recent episode was s ** t  after a solo player won a whopping \u00a370,000. Hitting back, she informed the Twitter user they were missing an apostrophe in their tweet. The user responded saying her performance was appalling, to which she replied: My performance through most of the show was above par.', 'I may have lost the Final but that was because my opponent was OUTSTANDING, not because I was \u2018appalling\u2019. Nothing to defend - I was outplayed. #TheChase.', 'Mark weighed in on the debate, tweeting: Interesting, Jenny has by FAR the best win-loss record on #thechase over the last three years yet the moment she loses (to a great solo 20) somebody calls for her to be sacked. Everyday Sexism?', 'She then asked her colleague: \u201cI was wondering - how much of this do you get when you lose, Mark ? I do wonder if there 's a gender thing.', 'Mark replied: Nobody has EVER called for me to be sacked or replaced.', 'Jenny responded: Really ? I have seen about a dozen in my mentions alone in the last 20 minutes.I even get these comments when I win : (', 'Many of Jenny\u2019 s followers also flocked to her page to share their support.', 'One user wrote: Well said Mark, too many people hide behind a keyboard. ', 'Thought @jenlion & @BradleyWalsh reactions were lovely at the end.Well done to all.', ' Jenny addressed the negative comments after she lost the game to solo contestant Judith, who scooped an eye - watering\u00a3 70, 000 against her last week. ', 'The Vixen took to Twitter to praise Judith, writing: I\u2019 ve been awaiting the broadcast of this episode...Judith is such a memorable contestant!#TheChase.', 'One user commented: Fair play Jenny.I absolutely loved some of your facial expressions as she kept pulling out answers, left, right and centre #TheChase #Judith.', 'Jenny replied: Absolute perfect play by Judith.\u00a370 k at table with nothing to lose.', 'She set a very strong 20, which forced me to rush slightly. ', 'Then capitalised on my errors by nailing pushbacks - which further put the time pressure on me, leading to more errors.#TheChase. ', 'Another user replied: She was fabulous and I thought you and Bradley were really kind to her and gave her the credit she deserved.', 'The Chase airs weekdays at 5 pm on ITV.'",

Jenny's answers were also outstanding, but 20 answers to catch someone on the chase is challenging for any chaser i.e. One answer every 6 seconds Any hesitation or  wrong answer puts even more pressure on the chaser. Judith did very well, unfortunately Jenny couldn't match her in this instance. I expected Judith to lose. I was pleasantly surprised. She deserved to win.",
