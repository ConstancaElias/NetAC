They are 100% convinced that all other human beings aren't as loved by Allah as they are, for example they say Asians are dirty and disgusting cause they eat dogs and Indians are disgusting cause they worship cows... etc and each time I start arguing with them about such things they bash me off and start treating me as if I was a Kafira that I'm trying to be open-minded and it's against Allah's rules. I'm sick of trying to the point where I don't even want to argue anymore, I'll let them think the way they think and I feel blessed to not be ignorant about this.\n\nThe bigger problem is the fact that the majority of Arabs are like this that's why we aren't developed and we still have wars and conflicts, I'm not optimistic about this cause the society is so messed up they don't teach love but rather hatred and division.",

            "commentText": "In our Noble Qur'an, Allah [s.w.t] had already addressed the issue of 'racial superiority' in which THE CONTEXT is in the following verse:\n\n'Say, O you who are Jews [ applicable to any <b> race </b>], if you [ verily ] claim that you are favoured / chosen by Allah with the exclusion of the rest of mankind, then [ why don't you ] desire death if you are indeed truthful.' [ Qur'an Surah Al-Jumu'ah: 62:6 ]\n\nFor anyone who needs further explanation on why Allah [s.w.t] explicitly said '.... then [ why don't you ] desire death if you are indeed truthful' is because, in the minds of the 'Chosen People of Superiority,' they believe that just for being 'Chosen and Superior,' Allah [s.w.t] have already reserved Jannah [ i.e. paradise / heaven ] for them. Well, if they are indeed truthful, shouldn't they have the sincere desire to go straight to Jannah [ rather than stay in this world ] ?? They are the 'Chosen People of Superiority' after all. But nope! Never will they admit to this because they know they are arrogantly living in their own delusion of superiority which they themselves claimed. Even Allah [s.w.t] NEVER claimed anybody to be superior.\n\nLASTLY, FOR THE DELUDED 'CHOSEN PEOPLE OF SUPERIORITY,' ALL OF THE THINGS I'VE SAID ABOVE, ALL OF THE INFORMATION IS THERE IN THE NOBLE QUR'AN, HENCE ALL OF THIS ARE FROM ALLAH'S [ S.W.T ] WORD. SO DON'T BE ANGRY WITH ME. BE ANGRY TOWARDS ALLAH",

            "commentText": "I agree with this! Thank you for promoting this mentality. Cultural superiority and this kind of \"tribal identity\" thing has been the cause of so much conflict. There's <b> nothing </b>wrong with being proud of your culture but you shouldn't let it make you look at others as below you. \nAlso, not to offend anyone, but at the time before Islam, the ignorance was rampant among Arab tribes. The<b>  Quran</b> literally calls it Jahiliyyah, or the Period of Ignorance/Paganism. Worshiping idols, burying their daughters alive, etc. The Prophet (s.a.w.) and th<b> e Qura</b>n were sent to correct them and \"perfect their character (akhlaq)\". So I think it's inaccurate for Arabs to feel superior for having Islam revealed to their people. It's a beautiful language and a beautiful culture, but again, not inherently better than everyone else.",

Among hispanics they idolize fair skin and talk among themselves about who's white in the family. It's everywhere. But I always thought it's might just be a preference most people have of what they admire. Not so much a <b> race </b>thing.I say that because men like Tom Cruise sell at the box office and all races come to see him or men and women like him.",

            "commentText": "Well I have an <b> Indian </b>friend in uni, in the U.K, who lived in Saudi for most of her life before doing 2 years medical boarding school in India after and moving here. She said Saudi is the best and when she lived in India she loved it too but she didn't feel fully equal to her<b>  Indian</b> friends because they view Islam and Arab culture as backwards, ugly and non-progressive or non-beneficial to the world compared t<b> o India</b>n culture. She had no Muslim friends, she truly didn't fit in anywhere, her o<b> wn ethn</b>ic place or her own religions place. Her dad was a doctor and some of his lazy untalented colleagues (yes Arab) would ask them to do some of their shifts time to time with no pay, he would be depressed but can't say anything because human rights and equality exists less there. She said the people there seem to lack intelligence, more lazy, apparently their king or something doesn't even have his personal doctor as Saudi/Arab, he is south asian, which<b>  is cr</b>azy, as it shows he doesn't really believe in his people's capabilities. At least we work hard for our successes and stay humble, and not rely on natural resources or faking our way through. It's embarrassing. Like without it, I feel like everyone knows the country would still be the squalid undeveloped, medieval-minded place it was before. It saved them man it really did and those arabs (I know not all of them are like that) are undeserving of it in my honest opinion, it's a waste. Imagine all the good other countries that need help would've done with it. I hope they realise that and get off their high horse and come back down to reality, because outside the UAE etc they<b>  are not</b>hing. It's pathetic and cringey. I've only met like two in my life, both good people and not fit the horrible descriptions people give them. I won't treat Arabs any different to anyone else if I ever meet any since my parents taught us some class and values. I know not to generalise. Thank Allah.",

            "commentText": "Here's a place you might start in defeating your \"arab superiority\", realizing you're probably not \"arab\". Arabia is a place. If you weren't born there, which you weren't, then you're not an Arab. In your case, your ancestors weren't even Arab's. Palestinians are largely SEMITES, descended from biblical SHEM. They were invaded by Arabs and so there is some Arabic heritage there in Palestine. But just because you were born in Palestine doesn't mean you're descended from arabs. It's a big mix now of Arab offspring plus Semitic offspring that people's Palestine and I wouldn't doubt even that there's bunches of more people types in Palestine than just semites and arabs. If you want to do some research on it you might google this term: \"Haplo-types of Palestine\", then take each haplogroup you find listed and do additional research on each of those haplotypes and figure out what their migratory route was and what cultures each of those haplotypes were part and then you'll have a real good idea of where the people of Palestine are from.\n\nIt's <b> weird </b>that Palestine is largely peopled by Semitic Muslims, ay? But it's true.\n\nProvisionally, I did the search and came up with these people types as all being part of the population of Palestine: Persians, Turkish, Macedonians (Hitites), Egyptians, Italians, East Africans, South Africans, Greeks, Spaniards, Portugese, French, Moroccans, Berbers... None of which are from The Arabian Peninsula. So the odds are greatest that you're no part Arab, even if you're born in Palestine, where for years the<b>  lame</b> media has been pushing the narrative that there's a split between Arabs and Jews. It's just hokey nonsense being sold by the billionaires who like to create division to use in conquering people for the purpose of THIEVERY, stealing their property and the minerals that are buried in it.\n\nIf you want to REALLY KNOW your heritage, get a DNA test, I recommend Family Tree DNA as they'll test for your genetic haplotype. Other \"genetic testing facilities\" make claims to know where you're from, which they can not possibly. So avoid any genetic test that is making claims about the region or place of your ancestry. You can know it if you know where your family is from, but they can't know it by testing your genes. So don't believe the fraud. But get your genes tested by a genetic testing facility that reports your HAPLOTYPE and then do the research on your own as to what MIGRATIONS your GENETIC HAPLOTYPE has endured. You should recognize in thos<b> e commo</b>n migrations someplace where you've been told your family is from.",

No, you can't have an expanding empire without war, that's not logical. \n\nISIS actually does many haram things, suicide is haram, they don't follow the ten rules of war, rape is haram.

Europeans trying to solve problems in the Middle East? Many Europeans are angry at the <b> refugee </b>crisis, not because children are suffering or people are dying, but because it's flooding their countries. It's what happens when you lie to a people group, divide them into unnecessary nations, ignore other ethnicities (Kurds), implement weak puppet monarchs, and all for some oil. Look at what the French, British and Italy did in their colonies! Now they complain because those same people are coming back to bite them. Look at how the west messed up Afghanistan, you supported the Mujahadeen, and they then become Al-Qaeda. You know what happened from there. \n\nYes... and according to you, only Khalijee are Arab, but all Khalijee are rich and can thank their oil for that. I completely agree with you when you say they depend on the west. Sauds are US puppets, and look at what they do to poor people in Yemen. Also, Jordan, Lebanon, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco are all succeeding and good countries. Arabs actually weren't strict before Islam, they were barbaric tribal people who would steal from each other. But that was over a thousand years ago, we can't compare the people then to the people now. Yet look at what Sauds are doing in Yemen. Also, there is a difference between Salafism and Islam. Salafism is a strict interpretation of Islam, amd not Islam itself. Don't mistaken it for Islam. \n\nThere are Arabs who still call blacks by this name, just as there are whites whom my refer to them as things that are even worse. I'm not sure where you get anything that Egyptians were slaves of the Arabs. Please go look at why Arabs were so easily able to take Egypt.",

They wanted to implement a government that leans in their favor, so while they don't directly administer these countries, we are still under their heavy influence. You are right, some of this stuff is self-imposed. It wasn't a Brit who poisoned Gamel Abdel Nasser, it was an Egyptian, our own people, betraying our beloved Gamel Abdel Nasser, just like that. But in fact, it is somewhat to blame of our colonizers, they were the one's who left us with these weak forms of government. Look what it cost us in the long run, if Britian would just mind their own business, none of this would have probably happened. \n\nISIL had <b> nothing </b>to do with Europeans? Weren't European countries (UK and Poland) the ones whom aided in the Iraq invasion of 2003, the same invasion that took down it's government, and put ISIL in power. There are many prosperous Muslim nations. Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Malaysia, Kuwait, Brunei, Qatar, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Albania, Bosnia and Tajikistan. These countries are doing pretty well. Even countries like Iran are well developed, they just aren't doing too well politically and diplomatically. \n\nThe Lebanese along with any other Arabs are well liked, whether we are Muslim or not. Syria is not in this state because of Islam. ISIL and Al-Qaeda are groups don't aren't part of the original reason for the war. It began because of conflict between the people and the government, initiated by the Arab spring. An utter failure in Egypt. The Assad regime is secular, not a theocracy.",

I don't know where you get this from, but it's wrong. Also, Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him was indeed a war leader, there's <b> nothing </b>wrong with that. He was simply a general, there is<b>  nothing</b> wrong with any general. Under him, they conquered almost all of Arabia, not even Al-Sham, Anatolia, Persia, Maghreb, Egypt, Indus River, Central Asia, Caucasus or Spain. These expeditions were made after his by the Khalifa that came after him. There were supremacist leaders like the oppressive Umayyad's, but that doesn't mean all of Islam is bad, simply because some Muslim leaders were bad. It should be noted that the Muslim community themselves were very angry at Umayyad's, hence the Abbasid revolution and why they killed any Umayyad leader that they could find or get a hold of. It was the medival ages, of course things like this happened. Things like this happen even in the moder<b> n ag</b>e. I would also like to say, that even before the Khalifa, there were Arabs in Al-Sham and the lands of Iraq (which is considered Al-Sham sometimes?)",

Brother, wjat you say about Khalijee is true, I don't disagree with you on this. Indeed they do depend on the west, but they are also diversifying their economies to brace for the price fall when oil begins becoming rare. Women are oppressed, although if your taking about Hijab I think you should know that majority Saudi men wear Kufiya a lot. I didn't know that they stopped cutting people's hands off, it's disgusting that they ever thought of doing so, something so barbaric, so uncivilized. I didn't beg anyone for help, no one is helping out the Egyptians, no one has helped out the Egyptians. I'm not putting the entire blame on the Brits, French or Italians, even the Spanish took some of the Arab world (*ahem ahem* western Sahara) but it wasn't us who implemented these weak monarchs. We were also lied to and left alone when the Sauds invaded Hejaz, allowing them to spread their strict interpretation of Islam. We couldn't stop them, what could we do? We can't fix our countries when they are run by foolish and horrible leader's. Name one good thing that Hosni Mubarak has ever done. Eastern Europe is better than us because they were able to successfully able to implement a good government system. We can't do that because we are confused and divided, we just keep starting conflicts, when will they stop? How do we even stop them? I mean, look at Iraq. In a couple years, probably a decade or so, it'll probably be better than it's ever been. Why? A good and stable government. But what do you expect us to do in Egypt? We've lost our chance to do anything, protesting won't help. I'm sure what really we could do here. Communism and dictatorship in both South and North Yemen have have severely damaged the two countries, the dictatorship still went on even into the newly unified Yemeni state. But then the Arab spring came along and just triggered a civil war, now what do they do? Europe is doing great because even before the two wars they were great major powers, those conflicts and wars have passed on. But we are still dealing with conflict, war, and bad government. Arab countries like Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco are okay because they managed to go on without conflict, but look at Libya, they are in a civil war, how do you expect them to develop in this situation. \n\nSyria, Libya, and Yemen are in civil war. \n\nIraq and Lebanon just recently came out of a civil war. \n\nLebanon and Jordan are dealing with a <b> refugee </b>crisis, they are not rich countries like Britian or Germany, they cannot as easily combat this.\n\nEgypt is dealing with a horrible military dictatorship. \n\nOn top of this, Khalijee aren't even bothering even try to host any refugees.",

Islam is not a male-dominated belief, it just seems like this because we are much more apparent. Enslave women? In what way? I don't know anyone who has married their cousins, but while it may be seen as taboo in the west, it's not in other places. I'm really not sure about here, because I don't know anyone who's married their cousin. Although a lot of what your saying is not factual information but simply assumptions, trying to make out of this and for some reason not bothering to do any proper research. Islam says <b> nothing </b>of joining ISIL, almost everything ISIL is doing is haram. \n\nSuicide is haram, rape is also haram. Slavery I don't believe is specifically haram, but Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him tried hard to abolish slavery. In fact, he married women to release them of their bonds. Please also do look up the 10 rules of warfare in Islam.",

And Arabs are the one's engulfing other's cultures? That's not why their prospering, astughfirallah they should completely remove of any form of prostitution, it's extremely disgusting. Whether you are Muslim or not, this should be <b> common </b>sense. Good on Tajikistan, there is no where saying women have to cover their heads, wear burqa's or hijabs. But they've done more then simply ban burqa's for cultural preservation, the president has done some things to restrict Muslim belief, and for a country that is over 90% muslim. Iran is still a Islamic theocracy where 99.99% of the population is Muslim, some Iranians teens becoming lax or atheists doesn't mean anything.  Actually, incest is very haram, tons of hadith (sunnah) is highly incorrect, and the prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him never married his cousin, actually, it was his cousin which married his daughter. That's not incest, and his cousin was much younger then him. ISIL should know what their doing is haram, just because some hooligans running around in guns, spreading violence, claiming their doing good in the Islam, does not automatically mean that these people are following the rules and teachings of Islam. Like I said, tons of things their doing is haram. And do some research if you'd like to know as to why ISIL is a thing. ISIL was founded by a salafist in 1999, I'm pretty sure it had no actual significance or relevance at this point, but what put them in power was the fall of Saddam Hussein which basically collapsed the entire government making it easy for them to come to power. Like the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, they want to get rid of foreigners like the west but they are also trying to conquer as much as they can and impose their strict salafist beliefs. And no, it doesn't sexually repress anyone, its just says to keep from doing disgusting haram things.",

Did they not wave that one of those Turkic pole things during Ottoman times? Those stuff are not Arab! Prositution is a disgusting thing... can't believe you would even think of ever legalizing anywhere. Tajikistan government, not the people. Tajiks mostly got Islam from Persians not Arabs, same thing with Turks, actually, same thing with a lot of people. Albanians and Bosnians never got Islam from Arabs, but from Turks. Islam is not Arab culture, it's an Abrahamic religion like Judaism or Christianity. In Ramadan, Bangladesh does not feast on Arab food, they do so on Bengali food, same thing with Indonesia, Kazkhstan, Somalia, and literally every other non-Arab muslim country. No... Zaynab was no his cousin, never was. Also, where do you get that we marry later? I understand that we might marry in our mid-20s, but this isn't late not for us.

And by thinking that the Islamic influence is simply Arabic culture, your not making any sense. Stop assuming stuff, look at history! Even Arabs were changed by Islam, yes, their vocabulary may have some Arabic words or they may use the Arabic alphabet, but the English, Spanish, Dutch, French and Portuguese have forced many people to follow their religions, speak their languages and follow their traditions. Many natives were assimilated into the language of the Spaniards, and many Africans, American Natives and even some places in Asia were forced to convert to Christianity! French and English are highly spoken in Africa, much more then Arabic! Same thing with the Americas, but with Spanish instead of French. Vietnamese uses Latin alphabet, not Arabic, not their own, same thing with many <b> African </b>languages, and other East Asian countries. Lots of Central Asia was highly influenced by the Secularist<b>  Communist</b> Rooskies, its not a surprise that the government in Tajikistan is how it is right now. Even today, they are heavily influenced by Rooskies. They use the Cyrillic alphabet, not Arabic. It's not Islam that plays fear, it's the Muslims. You are mistaking Salafist terriosts for Islam. So what if it's in Arabic? Most of our prophets are not Arabic, in fact, only two of our prophets were even Arab. Majority of them are Jews. It's in Arabic for fear of lost of meaning through translation or mistranslation, why are some Christian studies in Hebrew or Latin? Why are some Jewish studies in Hebrew? Arabic norms? I already said, it ha<b> s nothin</b>g to do with Arabs, you think it does because Arabs instead follow these norms, and you mistaken that for Arabs following their own norms instead. How is prostitution disgusting? You don't find that a women is making a show of herself simply for money at all even somewhat disgusting? Or that someone would pay a women for her to show herself at all disgusting? Yes, to a degree it is disgusting. Were not afraid of it, you just shouldn't do it before your married, that's all. \n\nIf you want to view it as a disease go ahead. But to add a few things:\n\n1. If your going to speak of the actions of the Muslims themselves or even \"Muslims\" blaming their doings on Islam, refer to the Ummah, not the Deen. \n\n2. ISIL does not fulfil anything to do with Islam, they instead are attempting to grew an empire with themselves at its head. They are using Islam as a cover, and they are also trying to us force people into it, using it. It's not Islam, it's just hooligan terriosts. How can these people be considered Muslims if they don't even truly follow Islam? Think about it.\n\n3. Salafism or Wahabism is a extreme interpretation of Islam. Not Islam itself. Even Muslims themselves think sharia is a flawed system, laws made by people from centuries ago.",

Yes I agree. SUPERIOR IN STUPIDITY.\n\nThis dude doesn't even realized that he has just ACCUSED GOD ALMIGHTY OF BEING UNFAIR. Hence his superiority in his stupidity, right there. Sorry to break your delusion but GOD ALMIGHTY DOES NOT create this <b> race </b>to be superior than that<b>  race</b>.\n\nLet me just say this to those arabs who are supposedly \"SUPERIOR\" that it's PERFECTLY O.K. to say \"I'm Arab and proud\" just like anybody and everybody else should be proud of whatever their racial background is. But it's totally a massive difference to say \"m<b> y rac</b>e is superior than other races.\"",

Facial features are very important in that, not only colors. I've see fair Arabs on the internet and they have Arabic features despite their fair complexion. I just don't think anyone should change their skin tone, they look good in their natural way.",

But how does that relate to you as a descendant of Muhammad living in 21st century who, unlike Muhammad, has no divine guidance or message from God? What heavenly purpose are you fulfilling right now on this earth that requires protection against wrong-doing as was the case with Muhammad? Now to your point about the Prophet's family, for most Muslim they're ordinary human beings. For Shia Twelvers, only 12 Imams are considered \"ma'soom\". Again, in what way does that include you? Now let me ask you this: Do you PERSONALLY (and in the eyes of God) consider yourself superior to either Bilal bin Rabah or Ammar bin Yassir?",

I remember that there was this huge Eid party and me and my siblings were playing on the bouncy castles when other children (Much older than us, they were like 14) would threaten us. They'd say things like ''You're not real Muslims, you're Danes! You can't be here! I bet you brought your pig meat as well!'' (This was in the Arabic Eid party, our mosques were based on <b> ethnicity </b>which is just horrible) This made me very sad, and soon enough i began throwing away aspects of my Danish culture. I didn't grow up with Arabic as my second language like all of the other kids, so i started to say things wrong, Grammarly incorrect, just so they'd see me as one of their own. My friend also talked very bad about Somalis and Danes, and she'd very often talk down to me.",

Real Arabs have always had white skin and olive skin color NOT brown skin as people are brainwashed to think. Saudis and Yemenis are mixed people NOT real Arabs.

The reason some Arabians in the south are darker is because the climate there is hotter than North Arabia.

People speak Arabic now and have parts of the culture, because they too were conquered by Arabs centuries ago, yet they seem to forget that fact. Palestinians are a mixture of the original Semitic peoples of the Levant who were living there long before Arab conquest, and non-Mideast ancestry from Europe, Asia, and sometimes Africa. Most of the people in my family look like <b> nothing </b>like Arabs anyway, and the ones that do, well it's because they simply look Semitic like their Semitic ancestors of the Levant did thousands of years ago. It's not like Saudis or Gulf Arabs would be very accepting of us anyway, so why kiss their asses and wish to be one of them?",

My classmate, who was Libyan, and I were discussing something about the Qur'an and he quoted a verse I didn't know the meaning of. He immediately goes oh why don't you understand this? Because I am not an Arab or a scholar?! I have had this time and time again (not in the same context) but a lot of Arabs like to make other non Arabs feel inferior. \n\nOne time we went to Dubai and at the airport, while leaving, the security guys would stop all non Arab looking people and check their luggage. When an obviously Arab looking guy passed by he would point to his passport in his pocket to the security guys and say \"Arab Arab\" and they would let him leave. \n\nAlso, Arabs would give more respect to a white person from the West than a non white person from say South East Asia.",

But I have seen mixed people who say they are Arab who live in the Middle East who bleack their skin..I also seen South Asians such as Indians and pakistanis living in the Middle East selling their own bleaching products for other minority immigrants who have darker skin. You clearly don't know shit about real Arabs. Real Arabs are proud of who they are and would never bleach their skin.",

Majm'u Al-Fataawa 19/29\n\nHe also wrote: '\u2026This was the position of Imam Ahmed (ra) and the MAJORITY of Ahlul \u2018Ilm.' Iqtidaa As-Siraatil-Mustaqeem 2/421\n\nAlso, refer to what he said in Majmu' Fataawa 27/472.\n\nUnfortunately, when discussing the issue of the \u2018Afdaliyyah' or superiority of the Arabs over the \u2018Ajamees' (Non-Arabs), many people fail to do justice to this hotly debated topic.\n\nSheikh-ul-Islam, Ibn Taymiyyah (ra) wrote:\n\n'Verily, what Ahlul Sunnah is upon: Is the BELIEF (I'tiqaad) that the Ara<b> b rac</b>e is better (Afdal) then the Non-Ar<b> ab ra</b>ce. Whether (the Non-Arabs) are Hebrews, Aramaic, Romans, Persians and other than them\u2026'. Iqtidaa As-Siraatil-Mustaqeem 2/419\n\nAbu Muhammad, Harb ibn Ismail ibn Khalaf Al-Kirmaany (died 280 \u2013 ra) who was one of the students and companions of Imaam Ahmed (ra) also mentioned this point when he wrote about the descriptions and BELIEFS of the PEOPLE OF THE SUNNAH.\n\nHe began his treatise by saying:\n\n'This is the Madhab of the Imams of \u2018Ilm and the \u2018Ashaab-ul-Athar' and (the people of) Ahlus Sunnah \u2013 who are the ones who are followed \u2013 (and they) are well known by these (issues).\n\nAnd I met those who I met from the Ulemah of Iraqand the Hijaz and As-Sham and other than them and they were upon these (issues).\n\nAnd this was the madhab of AHMED, ISHAQ IBN IBRAHIM IBN MAKHLAD (RAAHUWIYAH), and ABDULLAH IBN AZ-ZUBAIR AL-HUMAYDEE and SA'EED IBN MANSUR and other than them from those who I sat with and took knowledge from.\n\nThey used to say Emaan (faith) consists of (making) statements, (doing) actions and (having) the Niyyah\u2026'\n\nImam Harb ibn Ismail (ra) then proceeded to mention many of the well known issues of the Aqeedah of Ahlul-Hadith and then he said:\n\n'\u2026And we know the rights of the Arabs and (we know) their VIRTUE and their PRECEDENCE (in the Deen) and we love them because of the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him): 'Loving the Arabs is from Emaan and hating them is hypocrisy'.\n\nAnd we do not say as the \u2018Shu'oobiyah' (those who hate the Arabs) and (as) the lowly ones from the ex-slaves (say) who do not love the Arabs and they don't recognize their virtues, for verily their statement is a BIDAH' and (it's) in contradiction'.\n\nIt should be noted that the Hadith that was used by Imam Harb ibn Ismail ibn Khalaf Al-Kirmaany (ra): 'Loving the Arabs is from Emaan and hating them is hypocrisy' is not an authentic Hadith! Even though it's a famous and widely used Hadith, it should not be used to prove a point in Aqeedah!",

Yet, its so deep rooted into all cultures that explaining makes no difference to some people- but I will never give up. We need to remember that our <b> African,</b> Afro-Caribbean,<b>  African</b> American and dark skin brothers and sisters are treated most unjustly by other Muslims.

People speak Arabic in public thinking we don't understand what they say, but most of us understand everything but it's just  so so hard to speak. Inshallah when I graduate I'm going to study arabic so I can understand the <b> Quran.</b> Bc now I just know how to write and read it alhamdullah. Peace\ud83d\udc95",

So just because you guys have had bad experiences with Arabs, all of a sudden we should be ashamed of our \"superiority complex\"? The truth is, we are proud people. We are brought up like that, though people should not mistake it for ignorance to other races. Like, just because we take pride in our culture and history, As we should, suddenly that's a bad thing? And for all those Indians or people 'of color', It is actually YOUR OWN people who will teach you that lighter skin is more beautiful than darker skin, same goes to Somali's etc. Don't blame us Arabs for your retarted upbringing. It's not like we haven't go enough stereoptypes to deal with already. Subhi i don't know why you take pride in putting your culture own people down, but then again, you're entitled to your own opinion, just don't claim it as a \"fact\" and generalise the entire Arab World. Shame, i thought you were brighter than that. I guess not. Unsubscribed.",

It was very hard for our moms to talk and my mum tried to speak a bit of arabic which im sure she butchered, i could see my mum trying but when my mum suggested her mom to learn basic urdu so that they can hang out and interact she kinda bluntly said arabic is the most  \"aala\" language of all. which i dont argue with at all ( for her it might be ) and i myself would love to learn arabic. i do consider arabs blessed  but when it comes out of someones mouth like that . it does kinda hurts. Don't get me wrong here i do think of arabic as the most beautiful language but thinking ur better than someone on the basis of a language sounds wrong. the thing is they didnt even realize and probably had no intention of being rude . \np.s i love my friend and her mom too. they are nice folks.",

It was the first country outside of Mecca where the Qur'an was recited, acts of worship were observed, and Islam spread. Some of the Prophet's followers migrated there because he (sa) commanded them to since there was a just ruler there.\"\n\nThe Port City of Zeila, The Companions, and Najashi\n\nSheikh Dawudi wrote,\n\n\"The companions (ra) entered the horn of Africa through Zeila (A port city in the northwestern Somaliland), through Harar until they reached Ifad (Now a village named after Najash that houses a mosque, his grave and the grave of around 15 companions.) Because of that, most historians contend that Somalia embraced Islam early on - during the first migrations to Ethiopia!'\n\nI hope Khatib's will use these points this Friday and address the vital role Somalia has played in Islam's history.\n\nBySuhaib Webb",

And when these arabized sudanese started migrating to other arab countries they would often get the shock of their lives when they realize that all along they've been<b>  a Bla</b>ck ppl wearing white masks and that other arabs from the Levant and Gulf actually looked down at them and viewed them as 3abeed, resulting in an acute crisis of identity.

Not to mention how many arab countries, mostly gcc (my region), have a high percentage of expactriates who work in lower positions which makes us look down on those nationalities overlooking that in the end of the day we are all HUMAN BEINGS.

And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise.\" Allah also mentions that amongst these Arabs, there are those who believe in Allah (good Arabs). The poster is right. There is a reason why Allah sent the Qu'ran to the Arabs, at that time they were the worst of people and amongst other things like the beauty in the Arabic language. Now to correct your arrogance, brother. Arabs are not the teachers of Islam. Every Muslim is a teacher of Islam. We teach others literally or by our actions. What you're saying as is against the teachings of Muhammad (SAW). You are propagating superiority, do not do that brother. Arabs, Indians, Somalis, Europeans, and what have you are all equal except in good deeds. I repeat Arabs are not the teachers of Islam as Islam belongs to Allah only. Don't forget that Islam existed before Muhammad (SAW). It existed through Abraham, Musa (who was <b> black)</b>, and Isa ibn Maryam. Islam was perfected in Arabia, but it started with Abraham. Don't forget your place brother, we are all on equal footing in learning the deen. If you were born Arab say Alhamdullilah that Allah has given you an easier time in learning his words. But do not think you are superior to those who weren't born Arab as they will earn rewards when reading the Qu'ran. Read more brother, the great scholars came in all shapes, colors, regions, etc. Persian, Ethiopian, Roman, Arab, Egyptian, etc. Allah is our teacher and we are ALL students of Islam. Salam.",

[ Qur'an Surah Al-Jumu'ah: 62:6 ]\n\nFor anyone who needs further explanation on why Allah [s.w.t] explicitly said '.... then [ why don't you ] desire death if you are indeed truthful' is because, in the minds of the 'Chosen People of Superiority,' they believe that just for being 'Chosen and Superior,' Allah [s.w.t] have already reserved Jannah [ i.e. paradise / heaven ] for them. Well, if they are indeed truthful, shouldn't they have the sincere desire to go straight to Jannah [ rather than stay in this world ] ?? They are the 'Chosen People of Superiority' after all. But nope! Never will they admit to this because they know they are arrogantly living in their own delusion of superiority which they themselves claimed. Even Allah [s.w.t] NEVER claimed anybody to be superior.\n\nLASTLY, FOR THE DELUDED 'CHOSEN PEOPLE OF SUPERIORITY,' ALL OF THE THINGS I'VE SAID ABOVE, ALL OF THE INFORMATION IS THERE IN THE NOBLE QUR'AN, HENCE ALL OF THIS ARE FROM ALLAH'S [ S.W.T ] WORD. SO DON'T BE ANGRY WITH ME. BE ANGRY TOWARDS ALLAH",

I believe it's the history that our countries hold and just traits they pick up from their parents.. for example parents that feel superior over other nationalities will show it in front of their kids because they were raised not knowing it's bad so their children pick up from it as well.. that and the lack of education without being up any examples because I do not wish to insult any<b>  race</b>. In the end I believe tha<b> t Qura</b>n and Islam play a minor role in this.

Besides the Saturday Arabic school I used to go to when I was younger, I never really got to learn how to read and write and speak (proper) Arabic. I'm fluent in the Algerian dialect though. But I was once told that since I didn't know how to speak \"real\" Arabic, I wasn't Arab. According to the person who told me that, being Arab is defined by your ability to speak Arabic and I was excluded from being one because Algerian Arabic is far from its classical roots. That encounter sort of made me self conscious about my identity. So I started identifying myself as Algerian period. See how us Arabs even discriminate within our own \"<b> race\"</b>.",

Growing up I used to think they were the better muslims, we asians were some how lower class. Its only now years on do I see the problem with that. I mean it still exists in both communities. I went to a Muslim majority high school and I was looked down upon for brown skinned. <b> Racist </b>rhetoric was just seen as the norm.The worst was when I went hajj though. To go into the area with the  prophet's grave they split everyone by country, my mum and my sister was with me and we're all brown girls so despite being Australian they pushed us in with all the Pakistani/Bengali/Indian people. I have no issue with being put with that group but my issue was that the people in charge decide that it was appropriate to split everyone by country, then to have all the people of Arab decent go through first because some how their prayers are much more important than mine. In the end we waited for hours and we didn't even get to go in, we ended up having to go back another day and had to have the Arab members of the hajj group we went with help us get in.",

I often witness the indirect <b> racist </b>remarks us Arabs make unintentionally, especially of the desi community. The desi community in the Middle East are riducled and bashed, Arabs make their beliefs a mockery, and some Arab Muslims feel superior because they speak and read Arabic, so they don't have to invest so much time in trying to read Qur'an because it's their native language. But majority of Arabs own internalised hate for their own selves, you can kind of see it when they immediately want to befriend someone of Cacausian descent or someone with an \"ajnabi\" passport. I apologise to anyone who had to deal with us, and some of our<b>  racist</b> remarks, and the unwanted cultural situations we put you in, just because we're Arab. I hope that made sense.",

You are very correct when you say that many are unaware and they simply repeat words and expressions they have heard all their lives but it doesn't make it okay. As a teacher I always work to open the minds of my students to all cultures, religions, and walks of life and remind them that we are all Allah's creation and should be treated equally, respectfully, and with compassion. I'm going to play this video in class for them. Very well said, Subhi. Thank you.",

That's mostly when she invites her friends in her videos to spoof certain stereotypes for instance her arab friends spoofs arab men, and tazzy herself spoof south asians. Anyways sometimes as a muslim it can get hard to not get angry at the <b> racism </b>in the community, but I think in the end you can't really change what people say or if they think you'll never be a good muslim just because you aren't arab. As much as it hurts in the end you just move on, and you do things you love, and leave the rest to Allah. And for me being the control<b>  freak</b> I am, that is hard to do because my first (not best) reaction is to immediately trash talk people who ar<b> e racis</b>t or <b> be raci</b>st back, to take control of the situation and make them feel equally as hurt. But that's probably not even going to change their minds tbh. And my time is worth so much more than trying to prove to people who don't like me for something I can't help that I'm good enough. I don't do it for white racists or arab racists or any type of racists. I think putting y<b> our men</b>tal health over what the haters say is very important, and just block if you have too. Hopefully if we makes small changes as a whole the Ummah gets better, InshaAllah<b>  the ra</b>cism towards each other ends",

Of course this doesn't apply to everyone, most of the 3arabs I knew were lovely and some of my closest friends are arabs but there was always that group of people that referred to you as a \"bengali\" or \"hindi\" in a derogatory tone like it was an insult or something. Little did they know there's a difference between Pakistan, Bangladesh and India and Hindi is actually a language, not an <b> ethnicity </b>lmao. Also some ignorant people used to just assume all desis are hindus unless you wear hijab? Like they were legitimately surprised if you told them you could read Qur'an or something loool. Disrespecting other religions was another thing but that's really<b>  common</b> in a lot of Muslim majorities (like Pakistan), not just arabs.\n\nBut like a said, I only encountered a couple of people who did this most of the arabs I knew were very loving and accepting and actually really liked desi culture, as I did theirs",

While after looking into it you are correct. The <b> Quran </b>does not specifically say that Arabs are the chosen people. And truth be told the prophet did say Arabs are no better than non Arabs. Those who remain steadfast in prayer and fasting and truly believe in allah and the last day are the ones who are superior in the eyes of allah compared to disbelievers. However masjid al aqsa is in fact in Jerusalem which is in palestine and or Israeli occupied/ stolen territory. But I thinks facts point to where the location of the masjid really is.",

And it's such bigotry when everyone's always going on about how Islam is a merciful religion, and that the prophet taught us to be loving and kind and treat everyone equal, but then you always hear someone refer to a <b> black </b>person as  \"abd\" and make low and high key<b>  racist</b> remarks about everyone from India to China. Not to mention the sense of superiority arabs hold against each other, between countries and even in their own countries (the more someone resembles a white person, the more they're shown kindness and respect and vice versa). This really needs to stop. We really need to start being more aware and not let things slip by unnoticed.",

Even though I have not been brought up in India, or even been to the country, it's surprising to see that some cultures believe that they are higher that others even away from what would be referred to as 'home'. Thank you for bring up this issue and making people realise that God is still above all and since all of humankind is equal in his eyes, why can't we be equal in each other's eyes.

I have conversations with my Pakistani family members about colourism and how the ideology that a lighter skin tone is better than others is so flawed and makes no sense- biologically those with darker skin are more resilient to things like sun damage so how could light skin be more worthy just because of one persons' idea of 'beauty'? Yet, its so deep rooted into all cultures that explaining makes no difference to some people. We need to remember that our <b> African,</b> Afro-Caribbean and<b>  African</b> American brothers and sisters are treated most unjustly by other Muslims.

It was the fact that they followed a strict code of \"ethics\" that valued genealogy and the ability to trace ancestors back to hundreds of years which they believed reflected back on one's personal conduct. It didn't only target non-Arabs as this superiority complex manifested itself in inner-Arab tribal rivalries. Islam came and introduced laws that improved <b> race </b>relations, especially among the first generation of Muslims in Arabia .. it strongly encouraged the freeing of slaves generally and as an atonement for certain crimes. Sadly, it didn't ban it altogether. Muslim Arabs went from having the first<b>  black</b> secretary of treasury (Bilal bin Rabah) in Medina in the early days of the Muslim state to enslaving people of all colors in later generations, including white Europeans (Saqalibah). That is not to say it was only practiced by Arabs .. most cultures did it. The only difference is that as Muslims, Arabs struggled to reconcile their pre-Islamic traditions with a new religion that emphasized the equality of all races. This feeling of superiority is a remanent of days past and is mainly discussed behind closed doors since it is frowned upon religiously and morally.",

It's not our fault that just because we have similar heritage as of Hindus,  that we have to adopt evrything of theirs. \n\nIf pakistani culture is influenced by Hindus,  Bollywood,  India etc  then let it be as long as it is islamic (respecting elders, getting a good education,  working hard etc)\n\n just because (others).... they're arab doesn't mean they're better Muslims!! That's a huge generalization! \n\nSo I think it goes both ways, arab superiority and arab praise from non arab culture. \n\nLike stay muslim and stick to your culture! \nAnd if there's anything unislamic in your culture,  don't follow it or simply just try your best to fix it or find a solution to it. ....NO need to make your own children feel bad about the culture they were born in. \n\nI think a lot of pakistani ppl don't like how pakistanis get major influence from Bollywood whereas Arabs get major influence from their being arab and their history and how they come from the land/race (?)  The prophet came from\n\nI'm not saying that the ethnicities I mentioned  (turks,  Arabs, Indonesians) can't be good or better Muslims than pakistanis. .all I'm saying is that saying evry single one of them is good and flawless is plain <b> dumb </b>and stupid. \n\nAlthough I do agree that in some areas,  other Muslims are better compared to pakistani Muslims.\n\nIdk ..I maybe wrong",

Indonesia is not the same like Turkey or most of middle eastern countries that is homogeneous. We are heterogeneous and multicultural society but we have identity and our own uniqueness. I know it's not really important but just FYI\n\nAnd about the video, I think what he said is not to underestimate his ow<b> n ethnicit</b>y(arab) but just to emphasize that everyone is same just like what Allah says <b> in Qur</b>an. Of course I'm sure he's proud of his culture but he aimed it to racists that are still exist in arab society who look down people who are not arab. I've heard it many times from Indonesians who live in Middle East like in SA. At least we need more people who think like Subhi in this way",

People tend to either cluster Turkey in the middle east or say Turkey is very Western. Turkey is the remnants of a very indigeneous empire. It consisted of all kinds of people. for eg in the <b> black </b>sea region of Turkey there are the Laz people they have the laz language. There are the spanish jews, italians, kavkaz, chepni, turkmen, Rum. In Turkey they would ask which part you are from and ask your ancestry because we are not all Turks. Turkic people are spread out across asia and Eurasia. Turkey is different. People dont realise that.",

In the Emevi empire there was a strong movement along non Arabs called shuubiyya and they were all non Arabs who are against the <b> racism </b>and slavery that is done. Search it. It's sad and even till now Arabs say that the movement was wrong when it wasn't. Also a lot of the non Arab Muslim scientists and authors in abbasi times were arabnised and even shamed and discriminated and called infidels for having different knowledge or religion (that is not told to anyone who doesn't dig in the history those people we know now as big were people who were wanted for their heads) and for having a mixed blood or for being completely from another<b>  race</b> or writing about things that is no<b> t commo</b>n to Arabs knowledge which Persians and Turks mastered. And even now they still make all the non Arab authors back in the \"Islamic history\" as Arabs with really smart way like adding \"al\" in the beginning of surnames as an example instead of well known khavarizmi they add alkavarzimi. Those people suffered a lot sadly the pressure was real. Islamic history isn't something to be proud of just like the times of dark ages Europe. And if people kept believing in what they <b> do nothi</b>ng will change which doesn't",

You're speaking English, Does that mean you're English ? See how silly you sound ? No, speaking a language doesn't make you an Arab, and the language you speak is a corrupt language, It's not the original Arabic, but that's another topic....Being  Arab means having Arab genes,  Do a DNA test and compare your DNA with the DNA of a Saudi or a Yemeni, You will see that their DNA is completely different from yours.  Arabs conquered Egypt , That's the reason you speak the language you speak, Your people were already in Egypt and they didn't speak Arabic. Egypt was a Christian Country and the Current Egyptian language was influenced by the Coptic language, The language of the Egyptian people. + There is not 22 Arab countries.  Hahaha Sad to see that so many Egyptians are brainwashed.  You could say Arabic speaking country , Not Arab, even saying Arabic speaking country would sound kind of <b> weird </b>because The language spoken in Algeria is not the same Language spoken In Iraq.

Hahaha Assuming that I'm Arab and I believe in Arab supremacy just because I said something that goes against your ignorant world view  just  shows how uneducated you are.  No, Egyptians are Not Arabs. A simple DNA test will show you that, Todays Egyptians are natives to Egypt , just like their North <b> African </b>neighbors are native to their respective countries  (Morocco,  Algeria,Libya, Tunisia).

What I'm doing is simply waking up Egyptians and other colonized people of their delusion,  their <b> mental </b>slavery. I  have a Palestinian friend who fell in love with a Saudi<b>  woman</b> and her family was totally against an<b> d racis</b>t, he told me how they saw him as inferior. Why would<b>  a bla</b>ck person claim to be white ? Wouldn't you think that that person has been brainwashed or has some internalized opression or shame of who they are ?   Egyptians should embrace who they are. I can tell you one thing:  As long as Wannabe Arabs like Egyptians keep bowing down to Arabs they will never be enlightened, Egypt will keep being a shithole and a backwards country. The culture of Egypt is not Arab and will never be. The current Egyptian culture has been infested by a cancer which is destroying Egypt and dividing it's people. Look at the Coptic Christians being  hunt down and killed,  to the ignorant fools in this comment section who are saying that I'm trying to define her identity :  what are you doing to the minorities in your country ? Which people are trying to impose their identity on others ?  Christians are being hunt down for being Christians so don't even start with that BS.   Why are people of color   so quick to march against European colonialism but when it comes to Arab colonial<b> ism nob</b>ody says a damn thing about it ?  You get what you deserve, The leader reflects the image of it's people,  You got Dictators like Sisi and Assad because you are not enlightened and not prepared to progress and development.  You worship Tyrants, you get tyrants. You live in total ignorance,  look at any middle eastern or n<b> orth Afr</b>ican country and ask yourself,  what went wrong  ? You know the answer.  Keep rejecting reality, worshipping Tyrants  and EMBRACING ARAB COLONIALISM , all you Wil achieve by doing that is your total destruction. By the way:  Tiran and Sanafir are Egyptian !!! Look how weak and pathetic the Egyptian gov't looked like giving it to Saudi Arabia, And the people have the audacity to complain about it when they themselves are Wannabe Arabs, That's what you get for being a Slave of Arabs.

In addition to politics  and Abdelnasser's \"pan-arab\" pipe dream.  You're literally talking to people who think speaking a language = <b> ethnic,</b> genetic identity.     There are many valid genetic tests and studies done on Egyptians that show they're significantly more genetically related to copts and their ancient Pharoa ancestors than to their neighboring Arab countries like the Gulf Arabs.  But unfortunately they're too far gone to even look at scientific studies. Are you half Amazigh BTW?",

I'm an Egyptian myself mixed with other 2 Arab countries that are not originally Arab as well. Well let me tell you that when we speak about Arabs we don't include ourselves and when you state this fact it doesn't trigger us. I'm a person who is really proud to not have even 1% Arab origins and if you consider us Arabs this doesn't flatter us because you're putting a 7 thousand + culture under the Arabian category. We surely all know that the pyramids were built by Egyptians not Arabs. This Arab superiority thing doesn't work on us we're the ones who don't want to be called Arabs not you who don't want us to be one of you. Oh and btw one of the reasons why \"you\" put us under this category is because of our military forces and we all know that if Egypt becomes independent again your countries will be <b> nothing </b>without us and our protection. The world knows Egypt for its culture not for being Arab. Have a nice day",

And simply we from the Arabian Peninsula can  say we are not Arabs because we werent Arabs in the first place we were many Semite tribes each called a different name like Qedarites in Saudi Arabia,  Sabaeans in Yemen , Majanites in Oman and Dilmunites in Bahrain or east Arabian peninsula. I dont know why some westerners say \"the only Arabs are from Arabian Peninsula\" when we(people of the Arabian Peninsula) too are descendants of our ancient people that weren't called Arabs, the Arab word came later in mid ninth century BCE. So if some autistic people think they are for example Phoenicians and Not Arabs therefore we too are Dilmunites and not Arabs. I hope you got my point",

Yes, Egypt has an ancient non Arab cultural heritage, no-one denied that. However, Arab culture has been a huge influence on Egypt for well over a thousand years, in addition to the many people that migrated to Egypt from the Levant and the Arab peninsula. In the modern political sense most Egyptians consider themselves Arab and are considered Arab in a broad sense on the world stage due to their close linguistic, geographical and cultural ties with the rest of the Arab world. This in no way means that Egyptians have given up, or were asked to give up their unique cultural identity as Egyptians. I get that you think you have made a very clear open and close argument, but in trying to substantiate a group's<b>  ethnic</b>/cultural identity  by citing \"DNA tests\" you've only succeeded in sounding anachronistic.",

For the most part, saudis are actually really nice and friendly. But then there are some who just never think of us Indians as equals. Like you said, people come up to me to ask something and then they realize that I'm not Saudi and go \"ohh anta hindi\" and then just walk away. Not everyone is like that but there are some who just think we are not one of them (as in we're Muslims too). I also face something similar in India because of my religion (a religion I'm grateful to be able to follow).

To be fair though, I've hardly acquainted myself with European Canadians in my time here since I live in Toronto, but on the off-chance that I have it's almost always a negative experience because I'm outwardly Muslim. Despite all this, I do miss life in Jeddah, the friends I made, the vibrant masjids, the overall friendly people, and the feeling of truly living under Islam. I cannot stress the final point enough, since living in the west inevitably corrupts your imaan. As evidence for this, the general Muslim population where I live are deep into riba and their brains have been hardwired to accept secular liberalism. If it were up to me, I would have never left KSA, even if it meant working a menial job. And if any of you are thinking of leaving your Islamic environment just because of a few bad encounters with non-practicing Muslims, by Allah, it's not worth it. Islam comes first.",

You don't speak for everyone. If you want to address your own personal experience then that's fine but don't make blanket statements. What about the <b> racism </b>and prejudice in south Asian communities towards others? That's more appropriate for you to talk about. Subhi is arab and is talking about what he has witnessed in the Arab community. It's not to open a discussion for a south Asian to attack Arabs. It can't be that bad if south Asians still flock to the middle east right? Also, the examples you give are not so much to do with<b>  race</b> but rather with class. Maids are mistreated everywhere.

We actually fought some Arabs, and to this day, a lot of Turks have not forgotten that. My father for example always brings that up. Funny things is, my whole friend group is Arab (like 95% Moroccan) haha. They love Turks and the Ottoman Empire, they stand by it. So yeah it is kind of a <b> weird </b>relationship. Then some Arabs do hate Turks too. But now it sounds like all Turks hate Arabs (which is not the case btw) there are lots of us who love them back.",

They had this mentality that i didnt understand? , they respected me  , but were lowkey <b> racist </b>toward me , they had their own clique , and would start talking in their dialect whenever others were near , they had this feeling of superiority , and u see , i was respected less than the khalijis and southasians because i am moroccan (north<b>  african</b>) , but i was respected more and taken into consideration compared to my european an<b> d india</b>n muslim classmates . It was really hateful  to think that we were one body (muslims) but it was true.",

I know a lot of terrible Saudis (mostly they've been boys ahaha) but really they aren't that much, honestly. And Saudis especially are very nice to Sudanese people (I'm Sudanese), honestly they're one of the few Arab countries that have respect for us. I can happily say that I have never been wronged by them and my father also says in Sudanese, \"ma gasaru leyna\"! Yeah there are some <b> racist </b>ones but these ones are<b>  racist</b> to Saudis that are dark-skinned as well, so I don't really care what they say. :)\nI have been mistaked for being Saudi an<b> d India</b>n though, and I can assure you the difference! This happened TWICE before, I'm looking outside the bus in the morning, this random Saudi guy rolls down the window and makes fun of me for bein<b> g \"Indi</b>an\" by attempting to sing<b>  an Ind</b>ian song. Some of the boys in my neighborhood tease and make fun of me whenever I hang out wit<b> h my In</b>dian friends 'cause they thin<b> k I'm I</b>ndian as well, and when I talk Arabic back to them calling me names in Arabic they get all shocked.  \nbut tbh even some<b>  of my </b>Indian friends ha<b> ve said</b> racist things about Saudis because of how much they hate him.. both are at fault. :(",

In my country, Singapore, we're (alhamdulillah) quuuite united in terms of <b> race,</b> culture, religion etc. However, that doesn't mean<b>  racism</b> doesn't exist. It is VERY MUCH alive, just that majority of the people here normalise this, which is so so sad because they think tha<b> t racis</b>m is only exclusive to the US. SEE FOLKS THIS IS THE PROBLEM RIGHT HERE. I've personally received remarks from random strangers eg. \"wow you're in a university? You're smart for a Malay girl\" and \"you speak well for a Malay\". I've even heard things on the street (and whoa, the things people say are so upsetting). I try my best to politely call people out on this, but they take it as a joke like \"man, don't be so serious\", \"it's true right?\" and \"he/she also said this\". LMAO just because other people say this doesn't make it ok!!!! And you're right about the family/relatives thing - it's even harder to call them out on this because of our family tie and my respect for them. s i g h.",

Maybe I'm wrong but I would love to show this video to my half sisters who don't speak English who judge me at every turn for not being Palestinian or Muslim enough because I was raised in America. Anyways, great point, love it!",

            "commentText": "I feel like non-arabs make arabs feel superior by also imitating the culture w wearing thobes and abayas and speaking arabic. Like other cultures will regard people in their culture as superior or better than them if they are more similar to arabs which is a shame. I feel like arabs and non-arabs both play a part in this superiority complex almost like non-arabs subconciously feel that arabs are superior and arabs pick up on that and it reaffirms it fot them. GUYS I DIDN'T EXPLAIN THIS PROPERLY. I AM SAYING THIS IS THE WAY IT CAN BE INTERPRETED BY ARABS THAT SOMETIMES CULUTURAL APPRECIATION CAN BE MISTAKEN FOR IMITATING THE CULTURE SO SOME ARABS FEEL AS IF NON-ARABS ARE TRYING TO BE LIKE THEM WHEN REALLY THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO FOLLOW THE WAY OF ALLAH (SWT)& THE PROPHET(PBUH). I hope you understand where i am coming from i don't think arabs are better than non-arabs at all.",

My father went to Dubai a few years back and the first thing he told me was how rude and inconsiderate most native arabs were not just to him but to all foreigners even on the damn airport. He said he never experienced that in any of travels to the US because no matter what they treat you politely. My sister lived in Saudi Arabia and she narrated the arrogance with which Saudis treat South Asian workers and it's beyond anything you can imagine. Pakistanis don't have a superiority complex that does not mean that every Pakistani will be inclusive of everyone but they don't treat you like shit the way some Arabs do. Your own comment proves that you lack basic manners on how to deal with criticism. There is colorism prevalent in most societies including Pakistan but people don't treat foreigners living in their communities as lesser humans as a norm. It actually was an <b> Indian </b>incident in which<b>  black</b> Nigerians were attacked and beaten horribly in a mall this year not in Pakistan. We struggled for our own country so please don't pass those holier than thou snide remarks in our direction informing us how our country is less Islamic and it's inhabitants lesser humans.",

Growing up too my little brother had blonde hair and he was the only one complimented by arabs how cute he was lol. Luckily younger generation arabs in the west where i live dont have that issue its the boaters or usually the older generation. I do see younger desis with that issue tho. If anything my arab cousins who live up north get jealous of my  california<b>  tan</b> and say i wish i had ur skin color.",

Usually its more covert and coded in other ways. As a fair skinned person you are less likely to pick up on it. Blonde girls being called shalabiya even though they are not pretty at all and overweight or grandmothers favoring the more european looking or blonde hair blue eyed kids over the kids who look more arab. Or denying of a marriage prospect for their son and there is <b> nothing </b>wrong with the girl shes just tanned and its blatant why it was rejected. And this is from my experience but my other arab friends and by others as well as evidenced by this thread.",

                    "commentText": "Actually, Arabs prefer skin tones that are within a certain range. Too dark or too pale indicates that the person is not actually pure Arab. Not sure where this idea that we prefer pale skin and blue eyes is coming from. It is often questionable and referred to as mixed blood. The root of it comes from the fact that during the glory days of Arabs, slaves and concubines were brought in from Africa, Eastern Europe and Caucasian mountains. It is associated with most Arab's minds that way. That's why very dark and very light complexions are not favoured. Some Arab tribes are known to have gingers and in the greater Syria region ( Syria, Lebanon, Palestinian, Jordan and north western Iraq) we know what towns and villages have <b> red<b>  </b</b>>hair and pale skin gene mutations. The obsession with pale skin and blue eyes comes from the same mentality of idolizing your colonizer. For Arabs that refers to\nThe ottomans. True Arabs genuinely dislike very pale skin and blue eyes because it is either associated with slavery and concubines or colonization. Dark skin is just like the rest of the world association with slavery. Avoiding the sun is mainly because when an Arab tans, most often it gets blotchy and uneven after few weeks. I personally grew up hearing ' too pale .. has no colour.. looks skinned.. has Asian features.. kinky haired.. big lips' as characters to dislike. All back to the same point, just like everyone, Arabs prefer what resembles them. Supreme? Not really.. it is simply not same values or look of who we are. Arabs are the kindest and most genuinely accepting of others. Just because we appreciate who and what we are does not mean we have supremacy complex. I believe that as Arabs we have always been defending who we are because other Muslims and neighboring nations resent us for a few hundred glory years that are long gone now.",

Maybe your tribe is quite fair skin and other tribes not so. You can't put a blanket statement that real Arabs have white or olive skin. There's a Saudi Arabian man on IG name youngz and his skin is brown. It's like cardi B complexion and he's is Arab and he is Saudi! And he is darker skin! Why is it that when you go to Saudi Arabia the Arabs are A LOT DARKER! And that's the place of the holy prophet SAW? So if anything you are giving a very limited narrow skewed mindset",

Yes I know that there are many Arabs who have  this type of behavior but I have also seen this with some of the Pakistanis so <b> racism </b>and arrogance exists in all races .  Can you imagine the Prophet PBH he was majestic and people would tremble in front him yet there was 100 % no  pride and arrogance in him so people should feel ashamed of themselves if they say \"I am\"\n\nI have seen Prophet Abraham ,Isa,Musa,and Nabi Khidr PBT one time  how I saw Nabi Ibrahim PBH was the following: I saw Sayyidina Ibrahim PBH with a face that was not completely round but slightly oval, upside v eye brows, v hairline and hair was a raven<b>  black</b> and wavy and he had a aquiline nose bridge which was one flowing curve not a bump then a curve and not hooked neither jagged neither too big or too small . The curve started at root of nose  and was straight across at the nasal base  and he was  fair in color  and i saw him without a mustache just like how you see some muslim grow their beard everything about him was not too much and not too little.   The Prophet PBH said he resembled his forefather the most and he is truthful in his speech",

In our malay community where most of us are muslims, majority of us seem to think that the more Arab we are, the more Abayas we wear, or if we wear the kuffeyeh, we are more islamic. So much so its taking away our own culture :(",
