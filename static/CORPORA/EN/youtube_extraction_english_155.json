            "commentText": "You are so right about the medical community.  It's almost like they figure we are gonna die soon so why bother.  That's why I think an older person needs an advocate or 2 to attend the doctor appointments with the patient.  The advocates need to speak up and say \"don't write this person off.  They are vital to their family and community.  There is lots of life left in them\". You are not mistaken about this attitude toward the mature.  70 and older is still young and not ready to be left to die.  I think it is just terrible",

Such blatant discrimination is depressing--which definitely isn't good for anyone's health. Many people decide not to pursue zillions of tests, just as some forego treatment--not necessarily because of thei<b> r ag</b>e, but sometimes, yes.
