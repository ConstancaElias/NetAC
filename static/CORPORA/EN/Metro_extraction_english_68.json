        "postText": "An elderly couple were left disgusted after their waiter described them as \u2018old people\u2019 on their drinks bill.', 'Phyllis and Robert Hidden noticed the \u2018terrible\u2019 wording on their receipt after having lunch last month.', 'Just above the \u00a311.20 total the words \u2018Table: OLD PEOPLE\u2019 can be seen.', 'It\u2019s thought the waiter, whose identity isn\u2019t known, typed the words in an attempt to identify who the bill belonged to.', '80-year-old Phyliss only realised what had happened a few days after she\u2019d eaten at The Riverside Hotel in Kendal, Cumbria, on 4 July.', 'She said: \u2018I thought nothing of it at first until my husband pointed it out to me and I was shaking with temper.', '\u2018I was incensed.\u2019', 'She added: \u2018This is appalling behaviour. It\u2019s a terrible thing to label people like that.', '\u2018It should be table numbers you should be making a note of, not labelling the customers. Age shouldn\u2019t be what defines you.\u2019', 'Phyliss called the hotel to raise the issue and told them how \u2018disgusted\u2019 she was.', 'She demanded an apology but didn\u2019t get one until a month after the call.', 'She continued: \u2018Had I received an apology in the first instance I would have let this go.\u2019', 'The couple have now received a letter of apology and the hotel\u2019s general manager Jennifer Boow stressed the wording was not intentional.', 'She said: \u2018We would like to apologise.', '\u2018The issue has been raised and the member of staff concerned has been spoken to.', '\u2018They (member of staff) were extremely apologetic and didn\u2019t mean to cause any harm by what happened and no disrespect was intended by the wording.\u2019', 'This isn\u2019t the first time a member of staff has been caught out writing something rude on a receipt.', 'Back in 2017, a woman and her friends waited 45 minutes for a \u00a3160 meal, at Brewhemia in Edinburgh.', 'When she got the receipt, she noticed the server had written \u2018pain in the ass woman\u2019 on it.', 'She shared the receipt to Twitter to express her anger, where Facebook users offered their support.', 'However, there was no comment from the restaurant.",
