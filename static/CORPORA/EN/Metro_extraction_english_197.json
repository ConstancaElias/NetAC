        "postText": "A YouTube duo have been accused of \u2018everyday racism\u2019 after sharing a video discussing which areas in London they found most \u2018dangerous.\u2019', 'The pair, who own the channel Being British, sparked outrage with their now-deleted video \u2018Which areas in London are dangerous,\u2019 with some branding the content as \u2018racist and classist dog whistle politics\u2019.', 'Joel Woods and Lia Hatzakis \u2013 who both boasted to \u2018living in safe places\u2019 \u2013 left viewers \u2018astounded\u2019 as the vloggers named and shamed geographical areas with a higher percentage of Black, Asian and minority ethnic residents.', 'The vloggers offended when they admitted to feeling \u2018scared\u2019 when visiting Whitechapel, east London but added that they quickly \u2018realised\u2019 that residents in head scarfs \u2018are just normal people\u2019.', 'They both lived there at one point.', 'The Office For National Statistics states that in the boroughs of Newham and Tower Hamlets \u2013 where Whitechapel is situated \u2013 the percentages of Muslims is over 30%, which makes up to 21% of England\u2019s Muslim population.', 'One user on Twitter said: \u2018They picked places with high BME %s and were using coded language throughout the whole video. just be racist with ur chest [sic].\u2019', 'At other points in the video, the two claimed that people in Lewisham, South London made them \u2018feel uncomfortable\u2019, telling their viewers that \u2018you would have no reason to visit.\u2019', 'According to the 2011 census, two out of every five residents in the London borough of Lewisham are from a black and minority ethnic background, with it being the 15th most ethnically diverse local government in England.', 'The internet personalities did not stop there and added \u2018New Cross is a dangerous place\u2019 and \u2018I never feel safe in Manor House [or] Finsbury Park\u2019.', 'The vloggers, who have over 130,000 subscribers on the platform, also stated that when travelling past Wood Green on the Piccadilly line, they \u2018get panicky\u2019.', 'Speaking of the city, in general, the content creators also warned their fans: \u2018Don\u2019t show anyone you\u2019ve got an Apple Mac. They [criminals] will follow you.\u2019', 'Considering that London is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the world, social media users slammed Joel and Lia for using \u2018coded\u2019 language and being \u2018everything that is wrong with London.\u2019', '\u2018White, middle class and only feel safe in a place that\u2019s been gentrified,\u2019 wrote one user.', 'A second commented on the video name, writing: \u2018Which areas of London are dangerous aka a little bit racist.\u2019', '\u2018Absolutely astounded at these two chatting shit about London being \u201cdangerous\u201d and bad-mouthing Lewisham in particular,\u2019 another continued.', 'While one viewer commented: \u2018Probably the most revolting thing you\u2019ll be subjected to all year.\u2019', 'The channel Being British is described by Joel and Lia \u2018as a little corner in the internet where we talk about British culture, compared to other cultures, accents, and life in the UK.\u2019', 'In their trailer, they warned: \u2018If you are easily offended and everything triggers you, then don\u2019t subscribe.\u2019', ''\u2018But if you have a winning personality and love all things British and you are not an a***hole then this channel is for you,\u2019 Lia added.', 'We\u2019ve asked Joel and Lia both together and separately if they would like like to comment on why they made the video.

If you wish you can look for unofficial sources to compile or have compiled them for you. Then you can, but since everyone will be all over unofficial information i am not posting it. Now as you are lazy, although it's clearly trolling that you are doing i am not going to sit here and work each one out for you, you have the officeal sources, you have a calculator you can do it yourself i am not spoon feeding you.",

Those that are visiting landmarks in Westminster? They are also exposed to crime. You need to take into consideration the population that passes through Westminster. It is predominantly a place where most people don't live but pass through every day.",
