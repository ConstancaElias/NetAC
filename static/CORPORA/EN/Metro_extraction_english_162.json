        "postText": "A cartoonist is facing calls to apologise for a \u2018racist\u2019 depiction of Serena Williams facing Naomi Osaka.', 'It shows Serena Williams, 36, as a petulant child jumping in the air with a smashed racket on the ground, with a dummy lying on the court next to her.', 'Her opponent, who is Japanese with Haitian heritage, is pictured as white, blonde, and tiny in comparison to the \u2018disgusting\u2019 caricature of Serena Williams.', 'While Williams is shown having a tantrum, Osaka, 20, is seen reasoning politely with the umpire who asks, \u2018Can you just let her win?\u2019', '\u2018You manage to be racist on several different levels here, not only in how you depict Serena, but also in erasing Naomi into a skinny blonde,\u2019 Ian Rose wrote on Twitter.', 'My toon in today\u2019s @theheraldsun  on #SerenaWilliams @usopen pic.twitter.com/didwtQg1R5', '\u2014 Mark Knight (@Knightcartoons) September 10, 2018', 'Serena Williams was fined \u00a313,000 for coaching, racquet abuse and for verbal abuse aimed towards the umpire after she called him a \u2018thief\u2019 and a \u2018liar\u2019 during her US Open final defeat to Naomi Osaka on Saturday.', 'She used her subsequent post-match press conference to call her initial penalty \u2018sexist\u2019, saying a man would not have been treated in the same way.', 'The furore split opinion. Some said Carlos Ramos acted fairly in applying the rules, while others, such as author Roxane Gay, said: \u2018Tennis applies the rules inconsistently. This is not up for debate. Serena is penalised for things the men do and that white players so.', '\u2018She is drug tested far more frequently. There are two sets of rules and it\u2019s obscene.\u2019', 'Several people compared the drawing of Serena to cartoons of black people created during America\u2019s Jim Crow era.', 'Mark Knight, who drew the cartoon for Australian newspaper the Herald Sun and shared it online, defended himself by posting a cartoon he illustrated a few days earlier, claiming this proved he didn\u2019t treat women differently.', '\u2018Here\u2019s a cartoon I drew a few days before when Australian male tennis player Kyrgios at the US Open was behaving badly,\u2019 he said. \u2018Don\u2019t bring gender into it when it\u2019s all about behaviour.\u2019', 'Well Julie here\u2019s a cartoon I drew a few days before when Australian male tennis player Kyrgios at the US Open was behaving badly. Don\u2019t bring gender into it when it\u2019s all about behaviour. I\u2019ll accept your apology in writing? pic.twitter.com/NLV0AjPGsY', '\u2014 Mark Knight (@Knightcartoons) September 10, 2018', 'He has yet to respond to the allegations of racism.', 'Metro.co.uk has contacted Mark Knight for comment.",
