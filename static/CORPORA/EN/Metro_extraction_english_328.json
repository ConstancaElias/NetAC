        "postText": "A transgender woman tried and failed to sue beauticians who refused to give her testicles a Brazilian.', 'Jessica Yaniv, 32, accused 13 waxing salons of discrimination last year because they wouldn\u2019t trim her pubic hair and leave her with a neat line.', 'She identifies as a woman but still has a penis and testicles, body parts the businesses said they did not offer services for.', 'The waxers said they were either untrained in the art of scrotum shaving or that they should not be forced to touch male genitals if they did not want to.', 'Other estheticians said they refused to carry out the treatment for religious reasons, reports CBC.', 'Yaniv sought 15,000 Canadian dollars from each case, but the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal ruled in favour of the salons because they didn\u2019t advertise waxes for male genitalia.', 'Tribunal member Devyn Cousineau, wrote: \u2018In the genital waxing cases, I find that scrotum waxing was not a service customarily provided by the respondents.', '\u2018As such, they did not deny Ms Yaniv a service and did not discriminate against her.\u2019', 'The Vancouver Sun said Cousineau dismissed all of Yaniv\u2019s complaints and said her plan was to \u2018target small businesses for personal financial gain.\u2019', 'She added: \u2018In many of these complaints, she is also motivated to punish racialised and immigrant women based on her perception that certain ethnic groups\u2026 are \u2018taking over\u2019 and advancing an agenda hostile to the interests of LGBTQ+ people.\u2019', 'According to the Georgia Straight many of the women subject to Yaniv\u2019s complaints were not originally from Canada and did not speak English as a first language.', 'They reported Cousineau as saying: \u2018Yaniv has a grievance against certain ethnic and cultural groups in the lower mainland of BC which she perceives are failing to assimilate effectively into what she considers \u2018Canadian\u2019 culture.', '\u2018The complaints are one way in which she is attempting to make this point and punish members of these groups.', '\u2018Coupled with Ms Yaniv\u2019s open hostility towards these groups, I cannot avoid the finding that Ms Yaniv is using many of these complaints to fulfil her promise to \u2018expose\u2019 the \u2018bigotry\u2019 of South Asian and other immigrant or racialised women who would not serve her.\u2019', 'She was ordered to pay 2,000 Canadian dollars to three of the businesses for \u2018improper conduct\u2019.",
