        "postText": " Women don't feel represented by advertisements \u2013 even though they are the main responsible for buying decisions around the world. Nat\u00e1lia Hazarian investigates why that happens by specifying how ads are connected with sexism and gender inequality, and showing why we shouldn't tolerate that. With educational background in Public Relations, Nat\u00e1lia brings her expertise in communication and branding to the fields of sustainable development and human rights. She helps brands build strong attitudes in social causes while exploring how citizens are shaping new expectations and patterns of consumption.  Born and raised in Sao Paulo, Brazil, her international work experience includes the United Nations, Edelman \u2013 the world's biggest PR company \u2013, and multinationals like Unilever and Infosys. Natalia has also coordinated emergency housing projects to 91 families in 5 underprivileged communities in Sao Paulo through Techo, a Latin-American NGO that fights extreme poverty by implementing social inclusion programs. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx ",

Why do they then go out and buy the products that they've seen on said adverts? It leaves a huge plot hole in what's being said in this video, in my opinion. I'm not saying she's wrong, or that the adverts a right, but I am wondering why the creators of the adverts seem to be the successful companies.",

            "commentText": "Ads aren't meant to make you feel good about yourself, they're meant to sell a product. If that involves women (or men) having a crisis about their identity of appearance, that's what they'll do. Women are targeted more for ads aimed at their insecurity because women are generally raised to care more about their appearance, to appeal to others. Ads for products claiming to help guys \"get it up\" in the bedroom are equally willing to prey on insecurity if that's what it takes to sell a product. These ads aren't sexist, they're just exploitative. Not any better really, but we live in a world where money rules and products must sell, no matter about privacy or self esteem of the customer.\n\nEdit: Yes, sexisim and other forms of discrimination are widespread, and in many places affect women and minorities much worse than non-minorities. I just don't think that targeting advertisements created by cynical corporations interested only in selling products to the gullible through whatever means necessary, is a good place to start. The problem with <b> sexism </b>is deeper than that. It's ingrained into our culture, and in more extreme cases such as the culture of traditionalist Islamic countries, can result in women being systematically cut off from the outside world as a method of control. Human trafficking exists and thrives even in modern, first world countries because people aren't aware of it, or just don't see any way to stop it. Sexist ads are a symptom of a problem that pre-dates modern culture. We should fight not just for equality, but also for the sake of basic human decency, no matter how it be distributed. I respect anyone who truly tries to make a positive change in the world.\n\nAlso, to clarify, as I mispoke earlier, these ads may indeed be sexist, but the propagation of sexisim is not the purpose of the ads.",

Men are told to be the head of the house and they must bring in money to pay for the bills and rent or mortgage and this all starts from day one at school. When men leave the classroom and enter into the job markets they are faced with the reality that there isn't enough work out there and what is out there is below the poverty level. This puts a huge stress on the body and men feel inadequate from the get go. Men have problems just as severe as women do only we are told to bottle it up and never cry about it. In my country the No1 cause of death for young men is suicide and all men understand why this is so!!! Let that sink in real hard. It is at epidemic levels and is a growing crisis yet the tabloids and news outlets NEVER EVER speak about this. It is covered up because if it was to be talked about in the media there would be a backlash and a demand for this horrifying truth to be put right. Men are abused and sexualised and worse ignored in a far deeper extent yet women refuse to acknowledge this completely. I know several people who have committed suicide and some are from my school going back to our first day at school. I am not a unusual case but I am typical man who just have been sickened that this has been happening for as long as I can remember. Men have problems too but they are just different. It is acceptable for this beautiful <b> woman </b>to talk about this but when have you seen a man get up there and do the same thing. Never is the right answer because we are not allowed to complain simply because it would be perceived as a weakness. Men are not allowed to cry and share their struggles in life which is a terrible crime against men. Men have problems too but they are different problems and even this truth is beyond taboo and is not allowed in society!!",

I'm sure it has great points, and I probably agree with most if not all of them, but I have to say that these things are not taboo. Sure, your personal experiences might have led you to come across horrible women in the past who downplay male problems, but most, of not all people are ready to admit men have significant disadvantages in some aspects of life. However, this has absolutely <b> nothing </b>to do with the video. The video is not attacking a men's right to victimhood, it is not here to highlight how men have it better, it's not trying to silence anyone with issues, it's just trying to point out a specific problem that has to do with<b>  sexism</b> towards the femal<b> e gende</b>r in particular. That is all. Shouting men have problems too on a video about women is not going to help your point get across. And also men get abused and sexualized way worse then women? Have you ever SEEN the statistics on domestic abuse? Or talked to a women about their experiences with cat callers and men on the street? Have you ever talked to a women before? That's all.

Men are told to be the head of the house and they must bring in money to pay for the bills and rent or mortgage and this all starts from day one at school. When men leave the classroom and enter into the job markets they are faced with the reality that there isn't enough work out there and what is out there is below the poverty level. This puts a huge stress on the body and men feel inadequate from the get go. Men have problems just as severe as women do only we are told to bottle it up and never cry about it. In my country the No1 cause of death for young men is suicide and all men understand why this is so!!! Let that sink in real hard. It is at epidemic levels and is a growing crisis yet the tabloids and news outlets NEVER EVER speak about this. It is covered up because if it was to be talked about in the media there would be a backlash and a demand for this horrifying truth to be put right. Men are abused and sexualised and worse ignored in a far deeper extent yet women refuse to acknowledge this completely. I know several people who have committed suicide and some are from my school going back to our first day at school. I am not a unusual case but I am typical man who just have been sickened that this has been happening for as long as I can remember. Men have problems too but they are just different. It is acceptable for this beautiful <b> woman </b>to talk about this but when have you seen a man get up there and do the same thing. Never is the right answer because we are not allowed to complain simply because it would be perceived as a weakness. Men are not allowed to cry and share their struggles in life which is a terrible crime against men. Men have problems too but they are different problems and even this truth is beyond taboo and is not allowed in society!!",

She does not meet that basic requirement I'm afraid, not even the lower TEDx-ones.\nThis even might derive from the fact that there are no facts other than \"alternative facts\" declared to facts by <b> gender </b>study professional harpyies only.\nHaving some meaningless keynote graphics together with 15 minutes to display them or having one's ducks in a row for real are two very different kinds of approach.",

So a pretty good argument can be made that they follow more than lead. To then make the leap to connecting it to all these <b> gender </b>inequality issues is.. well.. a leap. Meh. Males are pretty hectically stereotyped as well in advertising for the simple reason that stereotyping is more effective. I don't agree that it has the predictive effect that you're arguing for. If you don't like an add, don't buy the product. Promise<b>  nothing</b> will be more effective. I don't like most adds directed at men but I find it sufficient (other than a snigger at the perpetual stereotypes) to simply ignore them. It's an essential skill in the modern world.",

No matter how you layed that out by example after example she would still never accept this. Ideology is a very dangerous concept and we know the consequences if it spreads like a viral video. WWII was started because an ideology was spread and the flock went with the growing masses. People can be horribly fickle when the conditions are there. It may sound silly but ideologies are gaining momentum in western countries and especially the US and Europe. People are turning against each other when they should be supporting one another in these economically difficult times. I don't see an optimistic future anymore.",

Men are told to be the head of the house and they must bring in money to pay for the bills and rent or mortgage and this all starts from day one at school. When men leave the classroom and enter into the job markets they are faced with the reality that there isn't enough work out there and what is out there is below the poverty level. This puts a huge stress on the body and men feel inadequate from the get go. Men have problems just as severe as women do only we are told to bottle it up and never cry about it. In my country the No1 cause of death for young men is suicide and all men understand why this is so!!! Let that sink in real hard. It is at epidemic levels and is a growing crisis yet the tabloids and news outlets NEVER EVER speak about this. It is covered up because if it was to be talked about in the media there would be a backlash and a demand for this horrifying truth to be put right. Men are abused and sexualised and worse ignored in a far deeper extent yet women refuse to acknowledge this completely. I know several people who have committed suicide and some are from my school going back to our first day at school. I am not a unusual case but I am typical man who just have been sickened that this has been happening for as long as I can remember. Men have problems too but they are just different. It is acceptable for this beautiful <b> woman </b>to talk about this but when have you seen a man get up there and do the same thing. Never is the right answer because we are not allowed to complain simply because it would be perceived as a weakness. Men are not allowed to cry and share their struggles in life which is a terrible crime against men. Men have problems too but they are different problems and even this truth is beyond taboo and is not allowed in society!!",

There aren't many advertisements (or movies, videos, music) that would put men in this kind of situation. So how they will know? How they will understand what it means to experience harassment every week/month/at least several times in a year? \nWhat needs to be highlighted and remembered: guys, do you like to be respected? Do you like to be treated as human beings and not represented to society as 'a thing'? \nIf you don't, then why you think we should? it is not about the product, it is not about buying it.

Fashion more.  Accessories more.  So their will forever be more ads targeting women with 'success' (in consumerism, landing a man, or watching their figure - to land a man and thus be able to consume more).  Yet men still get targeted for their bodies all the same.\n\nAlso, women also have been shown to respond to ads will sexualized female bodies (hello, D&B 'gang rape' ad.... sorry, but 'gang bang' and 'gang rape' are similar but not the same thing.  it's one of the leading fantasies to be taken by several men at once - generally consensually, but sometimes by force, or so the fantasy goes...).  \n\nSorry, but that's just marketing so long as consumers act predictably.

It recognizes the act of mothering a child, and honors mothers for parenting their child/children. What she misinterprets as the ad chauvinisticly demanding the <b> woman </b>to \"go back to working around the house\" is actually saying \"celibate the day for what it's actually being honored for... Mothering.\". It's hard for humans as a whole to pull ourselves out of our own personal opinion of reality, and recognize it for how it really is. So like \"we all shape our own reality\", and \"your reality is different than mine\" have indoctrinated themselves into our minds, and culture, suggesting there are multiple realities. But there aren't. The line between facts and opinions have been blurred heavily by this notion that our feelings are just as important (if not more important) than the actual reality of something. As a species we need to encourage intellectual thought process, and reduce the amount of negativity spreading that plagues our media, education systems, social media platforms, and interactions. Otherwise we'll be trapped in the downfall of our own delusions.",

I address each of her example advert below:\n\n1. This ad is from the 1950's. It is now 2017.\n\n2. This is high level fashion idustry, which virtually every right thinking western person regards as a <b> freak </b>show.\n\n3. This advert's point is the job that actually matters is MOTHERHOOD, not being a housewife. To think otherwise would seem to be willfully misinterpreting the intent of the creator.\n\n4. Brazil is an incredibly<b>  misogynist</b> society... you're preaching to the choir.\n\n5. This advert was designed within the same perverse bubble as outlined in #2, but then rejected by all decent societies, an outcome that should be rejoiced! You ask the audience \"what if this was your daughter\" when in fact anyone to whom you might be posing that question probably is among the crowd that complained about it. And by the way, this happened 10 years ago.\n\nThe title of this talk should have been \"The Dark secret behind sexist advertisements in Armenia and Brazil\". She gives the Talk in Yerevan, Armenia, so surely that more specefic title would be more pertinent, instead of trying to say that this toxi<b> c sexis</b>m is tolerated in advertising in the US and western European countries, which it really isn't.",

I'll skip talking about the issues surrounding the societal expectations for women to become mothers for obvious reasons lol. But the bothersome thing is that it's still implying that she should be doing the work on the day meant to be for her. It begs the question, where's the dad in this scenario? If she's supposed to be a single parent that's fine but I'm assuming not because products aimed at single parents usually go out of their way to take advantage of the extra selling point. Doesn't it feel just a little insulting towards men too, the implication that the dad is either A. Not present or B. So useless at cleaning OR parenting that the <b> woman </b>just didn't bother getting his help? Ads like this are<b>  common</b> and most have messages that are a slap in the face to men and women alike but are so subtle both will try to defend it saying it meant something else. Even when the \"something else\" is as bad or worse than what was assumed.",

You claim that it\u00b4s womens owns fault that they \"choose to give in\" to these ads, then I have to wonder; is it also all small girls and small boys 'own fault', that they are being exposed to these ads? And that they are buying into the idea that girls whole point of existance is to be fuckable to men, and that girls don\u00b4t have any value of their own, outside of pleasing men with their looks or niceness? \n\nAre the small children to be blamed, because they\u00b4re not able to think for themselves, and that their brains are immature? These ads are being planted into young kids minds early on. They are, and we all are, being programmed into the idea that men are superior to women, that men are powerful and women beautiful. Men are often entlitled, and most men don\u00b4t even notice this fact, only the oppressed part of this equation notice this, in other words the women. Men have <b> blind </b>spots atbout this fact and live in denial. And the more men fight womens views of their experiences, the more<b>  blind</b> they become.\n\nYes, these ads are being forced to all members of a society, noone can escape them, unless you keep your eyes closed all the time, and that\u00b4s impossible. These pictures of 'attractive' (fake) people are attacking us from everywhere. And yes, they become like drugs to immature brains in environments where these subjects never are being discussed, which is mostly all environments. \n\nThey tell us all how to see ourselves and others. Until we start to think for ourselves, and realise that they only sell fantsies, illusions, and that they hav<b> e nothin</b>g to do with reality. Ads hypnotizes our brains, the colours, the music and people in them are alluring, only to fool us into buying stuff we don\u00b4t want or need. Young brains are very receptive to the manipulations that ads are bringing to the table. So, it\u00b4s a huge problem that is global, and h<b> as nothi</b>ng to do with a single individuals choice of what to buy or not. We are all affected by the ads, whether we admit it or not, in our values and views of who we are.",

Sometimes people make a product they believe in and they want it to be available to you so you can solve a problem or relieve an irritation or inconvenience that impedes your daily life; it happens. But there's too much marketing research showing that consumers buy faster and buy more of a product and buy more often when adverts compel negative emotions in them. \n\nSeriously: the marketing industry could and should act much more truthfully, compassionately, and effectively if its power-holders so chose.",

This is not to say that men don't seek other traits, and neither do women.  Women will concede looks to resources more often, while men will concede personality to looks.  Each <b> gender </b>has its problems with shallowness.  But it's stupid to say that a man wouldn't want their partner to have looks AND a great personality.  Just like a<b>  woman</b> could want a great personality AND looks/money.  If we could pick we would make sure every box is checked off...\n\nIt's just human nature to want it all.  More money.  More looks.  More personality.  Not less.  No one wants a loser.  You get the best you can get and it's as simple as that.\n\nI think it's hilarious that you are an apologist for the ENTIRETY of women that they are so saintly as to not care about looks or money if the man has a nice personality!

Men are suffering from just as much as women, and I am not meaning to undermine women or feminism. Nonetheless we as men are suffering under expectations from other men to be hard and without love and emotions, \"men don't cry\". We as men, on the other hand, don't talk about it, especially not to other men. One of the big reasons for <b> sexual </b>assaults is this.\nI'm really into this stuff at the moment, and we have to combine both masculine and feminine problems to get a correct picture. \nWe have to learn to understand our opposite<b>  sex</b>, not become it ;)\nLastly, please excuse my english.

While men just ignores it and take a big gulp from their beer cans and go out without taking a shower or shaving in their dirty shoes and smelly socks.

And your guy friends will accept you without any hesitance. \n\nHow many women can say that your friends will accept if you go out with them wearing no make up/dirty and smelly. Or didn't get her hair done like the speaker in the video?\n\nThis problem is created by you, for you and suffered by only you. Just don't bring men into this whole problem and play victim.

It leads to women working less hours and therefore not being considered for a raise or a promotion.

The type of consumerism that promotes the idea that men are only as useful as their accumulation of wealth utility?  Partly (mostly?) because women seek out resources (or at least it's a deciding factor) when seeking a mate/partner?\n\nBoo-hoo.  Men seek out physical attraction (signs of reproductive resources) while women seek out hard assets (resources able to foster reproduction).  And ads are targeted as such.\n\nBoo-hoo, biology and psychology.  \n\nMen are soooo bad/stupid/dogs/__insert whatever completely acceptable attack on men here while completely ignoring/apologizing for women's contemptible behavior all the same__!\n\nHow well do you think a TEDTalk about how <b> dumb </b>women are for raising men to treat them like shit would go?  EVERY man comes from a<b>  woman</b>, raised in a gynocentric society (from mothers to after-school care to teachers etc) their entire formative years (and many now without a father figure).  Yet the product is always the same?  Maybe that TEDTalk could discuss women's shitty resource allocation abilities, generally speaking, and their desire to chase men with wealth (thus further incentivizing men to seek out more resources to acquire female attention).  Or ho<b> w dum</b>b they must be to keep buying and buying and buying and consuming all these goods they are marketed towards (yet complain about the ads lol)?  Or the host of other things women do that are equally terrible (pushing for larger social programs that are unsustainable, pussification of their bubble-children, contemptuous behavior towards other women based on looks/resources, etc)?\n\nThat would go over well I'd imagine.  It's just so much easier and more acceptable to lay all the blame at the feet of men.  Because we take it.  Rather, because we CAN take it.  Not that we should have to.\n\nFact is EA<b> CH gend</b>er has inadequacies.  E<b> ach gen</b>der is shallow in its predictable behavior.  <b> Each ge</b>nder is comprised of individuals that many could do better.  Yet all you hear is how MEN'S society has failed women the world over.  Women are simultaneously victims and yet they are told they are completely capable people.  They raise the men and comprise of more than half the population, yet everything is the fault of men.  Women have no agency.  Bleh",

It's not a human right for the perfume you like to be as cheap as the perfume you don't like, and most perfumes are unisex even if they aren't marketed as such. And generally, there's always a cheaper perfume that smells good if you bother searching for it. If women are stupid enough to overpay for this or that product, why shouldn't they? If a product is genuinely overpriced then there will be another company out there willing to do it for less and undercut their competition, and if you're too lazy to search for that company, or you care about the brand name of the expensive one then I have no sympathy for you.",

I think she is fully aware that people should care because women are people, not just because they are related to you in some way. She chose, specifically, to make that point because that is still a powerful way to get people to look at something differently. Making it personal gets peoples attention, and forces them to look at it from a different perspective. I agree, that ultimately, \"because she's a person\" should be the only justification needed - but that doesn't always work.",

Hollywood has some <b> sexism </b>issues, but it's not as straightforward as not featuring female protagonists. \nThis talk was about advertisements which are done by different people. Women are not usually the protagonists of the narratives featured in advertisements. This is a deliberate choice on the part of the advertisers, because they could be talking to women and featuring women as the protagonists of their ads. Movies and other forms of media have made that abundantly clear. \nAs targeted ads become more common: I think you're going to see more ads that are empowering for women, minorities, etc. It makes sense if you are creating an ad for tv to make one that appeals to the widest possible audience: which is white, heterosexual, middle-class men. But if you are creating ads for the internet, this no longer makes sense because an algorithm is going to choose who sees your ad. you therefore have a financial incentive to create ads that target whatever the audience is who is probably going to buy your product.",

I really love how she uses that for \"gang rape\" as well...\nA good way to support your narrative...\nI doubt the guy who made that one picture meant or wanted it to look like that.\nI would assume he (most likely) wanted a sexy way to portray it, but with those other guys in that position etc, and how she was laying down that looked a bit forceful.\nThis could be avoided by having at least some quality control, but not this \"SJW\" control as she supports.\n\nAlso its more annoying that more females will \"attack\" other females because of their \"normal\" bodies as well...\nDoes she really think all of them are photoshopped?\nBut I agree to saying that they might not live well, but at least they got a job and makes money for something I would say is looking cool.\nI wouldn't care about how she looks but the \"art\" that some of these ads trying to be (really depends on who's making it and how its sold?).\n\nand to that last bit... you wouldn't know that everything around you affects you in some way or another?...",

You should watch the TED talks given by Jean Kilbourne (\"The dangerous ways ads see women\") and Cameron Russell (\"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model\"). At one point Cameron shows pictures of her in magazine ads and in real life and it's a huge difference. She says that it's not her in the ads, those images are constructions built by a team of professionals. Dove also had campaigns against photoshopping because it has a negative influence on young girls. In the TED talk I mentioned, it was stated that 53% of 13-year-old American girls are unhappy with their bodies and by the time they are 17, the percentage rises to 78%. I remember when I was a young teenager I was obsessed that I had circles under my eyes even when I was well rested (in fashion magazines they NEVER had them). It took me years to realize that everybody had circles under their eyes, even the models in those ads. The photos were photoshopped :). \nAnd some ads are so blatantly sexist that it's horrifying, like that banned commercial from Guinness \"Share one with your friends\" or whatever...",

Have you seen junk food or soft drink adds ??? They are insidious...and you know who gets shaped by these?? The kids, so you can imagine, if to that you also include certain images of women that will on some level affect how you see them and treat them, and how they see. Themselves. And not everybody has a mom telling them \" oh comme on, the lady in that shampoo commercial has several stylists and makeup artists behind her to make her look so great\"...man that speech was sobering to me as a teen.  \n\nI am not anti publicity, but the people behind it should be more responsible.",

Then I read your comment Alvart, and you specifically mention the \"non-stop sexualization of men and women.\" \nMen and women are ALL affected by advertising, and are all objectified by an industry represented by men and women. I don't know what the percentages are, but I would hazard a guess that business and marketing courses and jobs are equally represented. Notwithstanding the \"Mad Men\" of the 50's and 60's, there are currently plenty of women betraying their own. \nSo effectively, the industry is preying on all of our insecurities and desires. I am not \"anti-business\", and many countries have advertising standards, but there is also the notion that no publicity is bad publicity. \nThe only meaningful way to dissuade these kinds of advertising campaigns is to speak up and not buy the products or services on offer - because \"word of mouth\" is often the most effective advertising.",

The names of the brands are 1) Ralph Lauren, 2-3) Mr. Clean (P&G), 4) Skol, 5) Dolce & Gabbana.\nPeople can always exercise their power of judgement and public manifestation of disapproval to those communications/brands. But even more important is to have coherent mechanisms and institutions able to stop communications that are aggressive to women and human rights in general from being published in the first place.",
