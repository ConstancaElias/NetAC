Hate speech is is the most important speech. you cannot speak out if there's no hate speech. More government is not the answer, less government is the answer. People should rule themselves by an elected government. Who in your country decides what's hate speech and what's not. I guess  the ones in charge .  The minority counts just like the majority . How can you protect minorities if only majority rules. What I say or think cannot hurt you only my actions can. Wow thank God I live in a constitutional America. In America the First Amendment is my right to speech the Second Amendment is my right to bear arms. I love the Second Amendment it protect the First Amendment. Thank God for America. No time in history has any country achieved so much wealth and power and done such good with it. Yes we have our problems but where would this world be without America. Freedom is the most important for any people.",

She alone, in an attempt to solve Germany's worker shortage, is responsible for allowing migrants from all over the third world to invade Germany. She should have known from earlier attempts to bolster the worker pool, that migrants from Turkey had not assimilated in German culture and thusly formed a parallel society in Germany. Two cultures occupying the same area is never a good thing.",

In this biased documentary, I fail to see one single example of ''far right radicalism'' except one attack on a persian restaurant. Alright but surely you can come up with more examples? And why was HE attacked? Missing info here.\n\n\nIt's not extremist at all to oppose a million people coming into your country who don't speak the language, have no home, no background checks etc mostly young men and the raise in crime backs up this but why do you not talk about it?\n\n\nThis censorship makes the ''far right'' movement even more extremist, you people are making them feel frustrated. Belittling them, insulting them, treating them like trash when many of these people just want to protect their families.\n\n\nMerkel wants to do the world good? I don't. Who put her in charge to decide what is good and bad? She should've had a referendum to ask the people, not act like a dictator and make the decision by herself. This is not democracy.\n\n\nI'm wondering though about the far right movement, do they hate people from middle east or ANY <b> immigrant </b>i.e. eastern europeans?",

That's not an invasion.  There may be a criminal element and also some terrorists (such is the world we live it).

The less confident tend to remain where they are, perceiving it it as too risky to 'leave everything behind'.  An <b> immigrant </b>population may seem undesirable at first, simply because they are 'different', but over longer periods of time, they tend to contribute skillfully to the societies that assimilate them.",

He hoped that the European project would go on to become the blueprint for a society run entirely by the global elite over a completely powerless population. He wrote that he wished to see the end of national sovereignty and self-determination and he believed that <b> nationalism,</b> and indeed the very concept of nations, could be demolished through multi-culturalism. He wrote that a society that was racially and ethnically diverse was one which was easily controllable by the political elite.\n\nAccording to Kalegri, a diverse and multi-cultural people were easy to control as they had no<b>  common</b> identity to rally behind in the event of a political crisis. In addition to that, a diverse population would be easy to conquer by the means of divide and rule. The newly arrived immigrants would be pitted against the native people with both sides believing that they were a persecuted minority languishing under a system of law that was rigged against their favour.",

One should be clear here: These Germans could have formed a resistance to Merkel's immigration policy without aligning themselves with neo<b> -Nazi</b> movements or without invoking notions of \"pure\" white Germans. Germany has had Turkish Muslim guest workers for decades, who are now citizens, and their children are now German citizens. For these anti-immigration parties, ANY non-white German is a foreigner. One could oppose new immigration by calling for limited quotas, or by making an argument that the German state does not have the resources to accept so many people so quickly (which is true). Instead, they resorted to arguments about the incompatibility of non-white and non-Christian people with German society. Yes, we've certainly seen this before, and to pretend it is just about \"preserving\" German culture is such a historically ignorant perspective, and it is disgusting to see so many commenters supporting that.",

and make the a 'Minority' in their own countries~?!\nTHEY~, all forms of 'Media' wither its 'Alt-Right' or 'Alt-Left' are so obsessed with 'Political Correct' portrayal of 'Multiculturalism' that even 'Cartoons' are are supposed to portray, ~the say #number~ of Millions that define each 'Scandinavian Countries <b> Ethnic </b>Population', must somehow magically include <b> 'Black</b> People~!\n\nSorry to be blunt and 'Politically Incorrect Racists' here, but the truth is<b>  'Blac</b>k People' are not part of the genuine<b>  '-Ethn</b>ic Make-up-' that defines the 'Native Swedes', Native Norwegians, Native Dennish, nor even 'Native Finnish' people' for thousands of years~!\n\nI hope I didn't burst anyone's bubble, by hurting their 'Politically Correct' feelings~!\n\nI didn't mean to burst peoples bubbles and hurt thei<b> r '-Rac</b>ist Sensitive-' view points~!\n\nSo, guess what, if 'Refugees' or 'Migrants' from 'Muslim Middle East Countries' (Wither THEY are from War-Torn Countries or not), cannot 'Technically' be identified as being part of 'Na<b> tive Et</b>hnic Swedes', Native Norwegians, Native Dennish, nor even 'Native Finnish' people population, no<b> r can </b>BLACK people from Africa or for that matter America~!\n\nSorry for the hurt feelings, if I insulted any '-SJW Politically Correct Activists-' out there~!\n\nNevertheless, just as 'Middle East Muslim Population' (Wither THEY are from War-Torn Countries or not), should 'Eventually' go back to 'Middle East' to get rid of 'Corruption' within their Government and 'Rebuilt' their Countries after the 'Wars' are finished, <b> so do </b>'Black People' wither they came from Africa or say from America~!\n\n Hope I didn't hurt any  'SJW Politically Correct Activists' out there, but 'Reality' is a 'Hard Pill' to swallow~!\n\nHere is example o<b> f why</b> '-Race-' is never ever an issue in this FAKE '-Alt-Right NATIONALIST Populist Movement-', but oh my god '-Religion-' (Particularly ISLAM) is ever more the focus of all 'Alt-Right' and even' Alt-left Media's attention~!\n\nFurthermore, the reason Turkey and Saudi Arabia and Israeli NGOs are IMPORTING all these '-Extremist Muslims or rather ISLAMIST Jihadi Migrants-' from either 'War-Torn Syria or Iraq or Afghanistan' or 'Economic Migrants' from Pakistan to European '-Welfare Friendly-' Countries like 'Scandinavian Countries, or Germany' is portray all '-Middle East Muslims-' (Practicing or None Practicing), in this ~EXTREMIST Fundamentalist Fashion~!\n\nMoreover, the reason Turkey and Saudi Arabia and Israeli NGOs are IMPORTING all these '-Extremist Muslims or rather ISLAMIST Jihadi Migrants-' even some whom are the same (Ex-cons released on bail to join ISI and Al-Nusra...to help Turkey, Saudi Arabia, United States and above all ISRAEL...gain Territory in Syria by Raping and Slaughtering Civilians...in cities like Idlib~), is to portray all '-Middle East Muslims-' (Practicing or None Practicing), in this ~EXTREMIST Fundamentalist Fashion~!\n\nAnd as everyone kn<b> ows, th</b>e common sense fact that 'Bad Immigrants' don't have to work too hard to give 'Good Immigrants' a BAD Name~!\n\nMoreover, as more of these '-SJW Politically Correct Activists-'  in the '-Mainstream Corporate Jewish Media-' work overtime to defend the 'CRIMINAL Intolerant Rhetorics' and '-CRIMINAL Actions-' of  these '-Extremist Muslims or rather ISLAMIST Jihadi Migrants-', especially those (Ex-cons released on bail to join ISI and Al-Nusra...to help Turkey, Saudi Arabia, United States and above all ISRAEL...gain Territory in Syria by Raping and Slaughtering Civilians...in cities like Idlib~) who are also allowed in Europe~, the WORSE it looks for the '-Good Middle East Muslim Immigrants-' out there~!\n\nBut one must ask why these '-SJW Politically Correct Activists-'  in the '-Mainstream Corporate Jewish Media-' do this in such an 'Obsessive Fashion?\n\nThis all because of the '-Kalergi Plan-' (-Look it up on Google-) that aims to bring in '<b> Asian an</b>d African Races-' from the '-Third World Countries-', and mix <b> them wi</b>th 'Ethnic White European Countries Population~!\n\nWhat do I mean by thi<b> s?\n\nAnd</b> how RACIST can I be that I dare say this?\n\nWell, given the fact I am technically 'Muslim' yet from (None Extremist Omol Practicing'...but very much believe in GOD) view point, and originate from IRAN that is located in the '-Heart-' of '-Middle East-', I very much doubt that by my daring to say -the Truth-', make <b> me into</b> some RACIST~!\n\n********\n\nWhat I mean to say here is this~!\n\nHere is the online definition of the '-Kalergi Plan-' stated by '-Free Mason Count Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi-' wrote a book titled 'Praktischer Idealismus,' (Practical Idealism):\n\n\"The man of the future wil<b> l be </b>of mixed race. Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice.\n\nThis should only really scare you if you're against peopl<b> e of di</b>fferent ethnic backgrounds starting families together - which is to say, this bit should only scare racists.*\n\nHe isn't saying he's going to force peopl<b> e to </b>have mixed-race marriages and families, just that he thinks it is pretty much - and very gradually - inevitable.\n\nDespite what is claimed, Coudenhove-Kalergi is hardly a hidden figure - he is widely known and referenced as one of the people who had ideas about some sort of pan-European political entity decades before the EU even existed.\"\n\nIn fact, '-Free Mason Count Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi-' whose book stated this '-Statement-' also described his views on how he believed the abolition of the right of self-determination and the elimination of European nations should be accomplished with the formation of an European Union~!\n\n*******",

                    "commentText": "So if you ask me why there sooo much freaken attention given to ISLAM, when the real THREAT is right underneath \r\nones nose, it is because this plan named after its pioneer and the '~Ideological founder of the European Union~', it is to DIVERT ones attention from the '-Maniacal Nature-' of this '--Genocidal Plan~'!\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, this '-Extremist Radical Omol Jihadi Version of ISLAM-', is a THREAT to both the 'Modernized and Moderate Populations-' living in the '-Middle East and Europe~'!\r\n\r\nLikewise, this '-Extremist Radical Version' of any of these '-Abrahamic Religions-' wither it be the '-Extremist Radical Omol Jihadi Version of ISLAM-' along with the '-Radical Version of Evangelical Christianity-' or '-Radical Version of Talmudic Zionist Judaism-~' are real THREATS to both the '-Modernized and Moderate Populations-' living in '-Middle East and Europe~'!\r\n\r\nAnd thus, this '-Extremist Radical Omol Jihadi Version of ISLAM-' with the '-Sharia Law-' being slowly proposed by 'Turkish Immigrants' working on behest of these 'Radical Criminal Leaders' like '-Erdogan-' into 'European Congress', should THEY be made into '-Law of the Land-' within these '-Western Societies~'!\r\n\r\nMoreover, while the '-Sharia Law-' associated with  this '-Extremist Radical Omol Jihadi Version of ISLAM-' being slowly proposed by '-Pakistani Immigrants- working on behest of  'Radical Criminal Pakistani Leader' are also a THREAT to '-European Moderate Societies-', should THEY be made into '-Law of the Land-' within these '-Western Societies~'!\r\n\r\nHowever, I am certain if these '-Puppet Criminal Leaders-' within these '-European Countries-' want to ELECTED into Office again~, they must STOP the -Bribery or Blackmail-' that they perhaps receive from the '-Rothschild Run European Union-' and (Much Honest leaders of 'Austria') become WISE onto this plan and put an immediate END to the '-Sharia Law-' being proposed by ~say~ 'Turkish Immigrants' working on behest of these 'Radical Criminal Leaders' like '-Erdogan-~'!\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  I am certain if these '-Puppet Criminal Leaders-' within these '-European Countries-' like 'ENGLAND want to ELECTED into Office again~, they must STOP the Bribery or Blackmail-' that they perhaps receive from the '-Rothschild Run European Union-' and (Much Honest leaders of 'Austria') become WISE onto this plan and put an immediate END to the '-Sharia Law-' being proposed by ~say~  '-Pakistani Immigrants working on behest of 'Radical Criminal Pakistani Leader' who have even created an ISLAMIST Enclave within the '-Savile Town-' located in '-Yorkshire Providence-' in UK -~!\r\n\r\nAnd if these '-Puppet Criminal Leaders-' within these '-European Countries-' like 'ENGLAND' don't yet realize that the only way any of their '-Corrupted Lot-' can be ELECTED into Office~, THEY will soon realize as they loose more and more cities to ISLAMIFICATION and '-Sharia Law-' proposed by   '-Pakistani Immigrants- working on behest of 'Radical Criminal Pakistani Leader~'!\r\n\r\nThus, there is SIMPLE SOLUTION to the STOP the ISLAMIFICATION and '-Sharia Law-' that exists within some cities in European Countries, whose '-Blackmailed and Bribed Corrupt Politicians-' long ago decided (~It was NOT Worth the Fight~) to STOP  '-Giving Away more and More of their Cities-' to these '-EXTREMIST FUNDAMENTAL ISLAMIST Migrants-' who turned their Cities into '-ISLAMIC ENCLAVE-' at behest of   'Radical Criminal Middle East Leaders-' like '-Imran Khan-' or '-Erdogan-~'!\r\n\r\nHowever, the real THREAT that no one talks about that comes NOT in the form of '-Extreme Jihadi Omol Version of Religion-' but in the form of '-Politically Incorrect- word that points to RACE~, is almost NONE-Existent in any '-Alt-Right Wing-' or '-Alt-Left Wing-' discourses~!\r\n\r\nSo, given this clear visible fact, one must why '-Race-' is an '-UGLY <b> RACIST </b>Word-' that must never be mention in '-Political Debate-?\r\n\r\nWhat might be the '-Global Elites- Plans that is seems neither so called  '-Alt-Right Wing-' or '-Alt-Left Wing-' ever dare discuss~?\r\n\r\nAgain, look up the '-Kalergi Plan-' stated by '-Free Mason Count Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi-' wrote a book titled 'Praktischer Idealismus,' (Practical Idealism)~'!\r\n\r\n \r\nWhat if Scandinavia United?

Millions of refugees, asylum seekers from a totally different culture, religion and values descending on your country and expecting them to integrate and carry on like <b> nothing </b>happened. There was always going to be social problems. Look what happened to Australia in the 1970s when they opened their arms to thousands of Vietnamese boat people. Have they regretted that and now Australia is extremely tough on asylum seekers and refugees because they have learnt their lesson. These are people who have had enough, unfortunately, it is convenient to throw the term<b>  racism</b> around. So if a ME muslim man preys on white european girls because he sees them as worth less than a musli<b> m woma</b>n, isn't th<b> at raci</b>st???  Why is no one complaining about that? ME muslims are one of the m<b> ost rac</b>ist people around, that is the irony!!! Have you see the way they treat their Filipino and Indian/Bangladashi domestic workers?? Worse than animals.",

            "commentText": "Ugh as a leftist, it's frustrating for me to see The NY Times reporting on this now. For years, the liberal media has been helping to normalize the far-right. They have run so many light, coddling pieces about how surprised they are that some people in the alt-right dress nicely, or that there are hipsters who are fascists, as if this is some quirky trend to cover with no consideration of how the tone and content of your reporting can literally affect the course of political history. By giving them the visibility of massive mainstream platforms, they exposed lots of people to the fact that there is a growing, ostensibly anti-establishment movement of these people and let them throw a few talking points out on the air, but they never really confronted the content of their platform in a meaningful way or really got confrontational with them when given the chance, to force them to show their true colors. \n\nIronically, by shirking this journalistic responsibility in favor of the liberal ethic of \"I have to seem nonpartisan and balanced, I can't take a side\" they have helped mainstream the very people people who may end up literally undoing of the liberal culture and pluralistic liberal democracies that they claim to value. These monsters are cropping up in one country after another as people get fed up with the status quo of neoliberal capitalism (and in many places like the US, being excluded by two-party political systems that claim to be democratic), and liberals have no response. Historically it was the left that provided a productive alternative for people to go to, to organize and press their demands for a civilized, just society, but the establishment (liberal and conservative alike) in many of the Western countries (especially the US) have virtually wiped the left off the political spectrum-- in America virtually all left-wing parties and labor unions are gone, and those that claim to represent labor are led by class collaborationists who are happy to sell the workers out to the owning class (so they might as well not exist). In places like France, Germany, and Britain, the socialist and labor parties ended up bought and accepted neoliberal \"reforms\" instead of pushing back, and that caused many workers to give up on the left altogether, moving to reactionary far-right movements (to the point where the French Socialist Party and the Greek Socialist Party were pretty much wiped out and replaced altogether). Liberals may not understand all of the ways that their politicians, journalist, and theorists/intellectuals have effectively aided these horrific movements, but there is a very real share of responsibility on them. I don't blame every liberal-- most individuals haven't done anything active, because most of them don't have giant platforms to give them visibility on, or political power to either use to help average workers and the poor (thereby legitimizing the system of liberalism) or to use to benefit the few richest capitalists (what they actually did). Having political power or a major mainstream media outlet is a level of power and influence that really does come with a certain social responsibility, and the way they have used that power since WWII (and especially since the 70s, when neoliberalism replaced New Deal values in most \"center-left\"/social-democratic/liberal parties) has led us directly to this crisis, where democracy itself has become delegitimized in many people's eyes because of the failings of so-called democracies (really quite plutocratic republics) and the quite right-wing liberals who were so happy to \"reach across the aisle\" and to work \"bipartisanly\" to help pass right-wing legislation that deregulated finance (eventually leading to the economic crash of 2008 that we're still recovering from), imposed austerity (which really has meant cutting social spending and public works while spending hundreds of billions on military and corporate welfare) and trade liberalization (which has often meant jobs pouring out of the developed world into poorer countries with lower wages with less developed labor movements)... The legislation that has made people so incredibly desperate and unhappy with the status quo that they're turning to literal Nazism and fascism. And liberalism has no answer to this trend-- it has two choices. Just say to these people (in the words of Felix Beiderman) about the world they've created, \"No, actually you love it--\" because they ARE the status quo. We are living liberalism, by and large, in the West. \n\nOr, their other choice. They can move to the left in a meaningful way and actually offer the programs THAT HAVE WORKED BEFORE in the New Deal, in Scandinavia, and so on. If the Democrats just embraced universal healthcare and higher education, they would win by a landslide and the alt-right would be marginalized. If the Syriza had been able to stick to their anti-austerity campaign promises without the aggressive economic threats levied by the troika of lenders and had had a real chance to implement their agenda, they would have had seriously good odds of winning over many of the poor, starving people who turned to the Golden Dawn <b> Nazi </b>Party out of desperation. And on down the line-- social democracy and democratic socialism are the only policies which can consistently make life livable for working people (at least until capitalists inevitably try to undermine them and roll back their programs, which is one of the big reasons why I think we need a system change to socialism rather than capitalism with some government program palliatives, but that's another topic). The problem is that the political elites who run the dominant political parties are reliant on the campaign finance from the biggest donors (who are the ultra-rich and corporations), and their donors don't want those policies, so they can't. And besides, if they moved to the left, it wouldn't really be liberalism anymore. It would just be social democracy. So I don't think there's really any saving liberalism, technically, and I do think they've inadvertently helped caused the proliferation of these ultranationalist movements and have a horrible track record-- but the good news is that if we just move to the left adequately and organize around actually productive goals and values, then we can win back quite a bit of the support that these parties only have because of economic circumstances. There is a growing part of the population who supports them for other reasons-- namely, because of a massive campaign of propaganda that wealthy, powerful people have been spreading including these insane conspiracy theories about \"cultural Marxism\" that helped elect Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, among other undesirable monsters... But those<b>  loony</b> right-wing ideologies are mostly too far gone anyway. It's the young people who lack perspective, but then are exposed to this propaganda and go \"I am discontent with the status quo and this gives me an explanation of why, and an enemy to fear and hate,\" so they buy into it and assume anything contradicting that information is just cultural Marxist lies... It would be funny if this wasn't becoming a normal thing to encounter. The mainstream media hasn't done much to counter that narrative either. I rarely see it even afinowledged, probably because they are so disconnected from people outside their well-to-do circles and don't see how prominent these trends are among the hoi polloi.",

Disgusting. Violence is always bad it doesn't matter if it comes from the left or right. Also of course this video is one sided as it is about the far right so it's only focusing on it and not on the problems with migrants. However, the left should also report more in separate videos and reports about how there are a lot of problems with migrants and their often incompatible views and culture",

Of course, I am against banning hijabs and religious symbols in schools because that is your personal freedom.\n\nHowever, it is fine to put your country first. It's fine to be angry when your country goes downhill. It absolutely necessary to protect your children, and to demand that your country remains safe. \n\nHowever, we also can't put all the blame on the refugees. Most of them are normal people who's homes have been destroyed due to western intervention. \n\nBoth sides are making this issue seem <b> black </b>and white. ---> Of course you have the right to think about the possible changes in culture that would happen in your country if tons of other people start coming in, just look at what happened in Palestine. At the same time, we can't force people to stay in places that are getting bombed. \n\nSo the question is: if my country won't take them, and your country won't take them, and they can't stay in a warzone - then where can they go?\n\nStop trying to polarize the sides of the argument, and let's actually start a conversation that could go somewhere.",

            "commentText": "This is the problem with the leftist media - They feed you with what THEY want you to believe and not the WHOLE scenario of the situation. They clearly have their bias and are not willing to tell you the full story and the story told by the locals. For some unkown reason they think they know better than the people who are living there. First they've shown a Persian man who was injured by <b> CRAZY </b>people who even painted a swastica on the man's store. They've done it to somehow say that this right movement was related to the attacker of this Persian man's store which is not true. The protest  wasn't about promotinh HATE towards immigrants of all kinds. The muslims who don't want to follow the rules are the ones who they oppose to. Persians aren't even ARABS in first place. The Islamic Revolution made a coup in Iran but most people there still lives their lives as if the islamic revolution didn't even exist. They're actually better than western countries when it comes to<b>  gender</b> equality and it ha<b> s nothin</b>g to do with ISLAM but with the people. Using this isolated fact to say that the movement isn't legimate because it has alliances with extremists is just pointeless. There are going to be bad people everywhere and it's wrong to label people like that. Shame on you, New York Times!\n\nThis comment was written by a brazillian mix<b> ed ra</b>ce with europea<b> ns, bl</b>ack and indigenous tribes. If that counts to you leftists!",

            "commentText": "Hm. Strange. It is true that mainly Eastern Germany sees an uprise of the right wing AfD and anti immigration protests. In Western Germany the right wingers have rather a hard time. While in East Germans who only joined West Germany 28 years ago were received and look at as economic refugees by Western Germans they fear that someone actually willing to work could take their place in German society. It is true that East Germans are still seen as  work-shy and mainly living on social welfare by West Germans living in the former FRG states.\nSo while there is an right wing uproar with the work-shy people of the former GDR, the right wing AfD doesn't resonate as much in West Germany. In contrary you can observe that in the well situated western parts the Green party is on the rise and has already gotten nearly double the amount of votes the AfD holds.\nWhy don't you touch on THAT subject too?\nI assume it is because the Greens don't help if you try to paint the picture of Germany going back to 1933 again...",

Why should the flood gates be opened to people, who by definition of the word \"foreigner\" or \"<b> migrant\"</b> under modern political theory, are not part of this statehood. Why would I want my tax money be used for migrants coming into my country? There is a very fine line that any government is walking along on this issue. For example, it puzzles me why the rich gulf arab countries like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, or Bahrain have not welcomed fleeing migrants from Syria. These countries have way more financial resources to support Syrian refugees and have more cultural affinity with the refugees. What about Moscow or Beijing, shouldn't they do their own share of heavy lifting?",

You want to be able to know who is coming in or out and keep your family safe.  You can have people over. You can let them stay and even join your family. It all works out nicely because you know if you can support them or if they can support themselves, who they are and how many. If you did not have a door with a lock or a door period. Things would be chaos! You don't know who could come in to your home,what they want or any number of things. Before long you would have <b> nothing </b>and somebody could get hurt. I am surprised this is so hard for the  New York Times to understand.",

                    "commentText": "@asborhen I live in a metropolitan area in the USA that has been about 50% \"taken over\" by immigrants since the 70's.  While it is not ALL bad, the areas in which they have \"taken over\" have been clearly blighted and are high with crimes of all kinds... the areas look like the places from which they \"fled\" for a better life, yet the areas they proliferate not only \"look\" like the places they came from, but are areas in which the opportunity they came to this country for have diminished greatly as well.  I believe there will be another 5 decades or so before homeostasis is re-established OR another 5 decades or so before virtually the entire area is turned into something completely different AND something that changes the trajectory of increasing opportunities if they keep pouring in as they have AND if they continue to reproduce as rapidly as they do and at the young ages at which they begin to reproduce... it is likely that this kind of degradation will continue... of course there are a lot of dynamics going on and it does not necessarily mean the future is totally bleak, but I see the opportunities for EVERYONE diminishing as the true concern, whether that is how the trajectory will continue or not, it is difficult to say... I am mostly optimistic ... but, this idea about how a previously thriving and safe area can quickly become blighted and unrecognizable, rapidly, IS very real.  It would not be impossible for the majority of a country to eventually become unrecognizable and the mindsets that supported the problems that lead the immigrants to leave their original homelands in the first place could easily serve to recreate the same atmosphere and problems in the new area if they dominate an area eventually.  \nFrankly, I think that is what happened in the USA... the Europeans moved in... the natives were taken out... things developed, a lot of crappy crap happened (and still is happening) and while there was some good out of the whole deal... the same problems, due to the general European mindsets, exist here. \nThe concern is not false fear... it is unfortunate that these real aspects cannot be discussed without it turning into some kind of <b> race </b>hatred thing.  Although, when you are allowing millions of immigrants within a short span of time to move into a Western multi-cultural and tolerant society,  from cultures that are chiefly intolerant and who are taught to hate the Western Civilization...  it should NOT be ignored.  \nAt least in my area, the dominant immigrants are at least part of Western Civilization and do not  hate the culture they have immigrated to.",

            "commentText": "Yeah sorry but this was a really biased report. I mean come on the AfD isn't the NPD.  Still no one should vote for them, but their members include former conservatives, social Democrat's, greens and liberals. It was founded as a The Neo liberal party and although not a lot of high ranking initial founders are still in the party leadership their are still more professors of politics or law as well as a lot of police officers in it. This demo wasn't organized by the afd and if that's hold against them you should make the left party acountable for the demos at the 1st of May. Difference is no German party is willing to cooperate with the afd while the left party is considered as a potential coalition partner for the social democrats and the greens. \nThe hole reason why the party exists in the first place, was that Angela Merkel moved the political focus of the CDU more to the middle ignoring the political responsibility of the Union to integrate into the right and meet in the middle with the social Democrats who integrate to the left (something we even learn in school here Btw), wich split the ultra conservative Wing of the party (probably still less right than half of the Republican Party ) into the afd. The Afd started as the most soft core anti Euro party in Europe (at least in my understanding) and even the German constitutional guard (one of the five separated governmental powers that we have instead of the classical separation in legislativ, judicial and executive) said they aren't anti constitutional, wich does mean a lot in Germany. \n\n(If grammar or tipping errors, sorry but English isn't my mothertoung)",

Merkel was democratically elected several times due to her doing an excellent job serving the german public all these years otherwise she would've gotten easily voted out, in the end germany is a democracy and not a monarchy or something. The situation that happened in 2015 wasn't handled in a perfect way simply because of mismanagement and not due to an ulterior globalist motive to replace an entire <b> race </b>and destroy western civilization as many right wingers claim. Despite everything she still won the last vote and nevertheless she herself just announced that it's time for her to take off. I don't see how she could be a globalist psychic vampire.",

Dictating who gets to wear what clothing?\n\n\nThe way the German government handled the <b> refugee </b>situation was absolutely horrible though. First Merkel made a big speech about how \"Germany opens its arms to everyone regardless of what\" then literally less than a week after that speech Merkel ordered that fences be built on the border of the<b>  nation</b>. You can't just call people to come towards you then start bolting down doors, of course it will lead to a problem. In many different ways for many different people.\n\n\nSome might argue that Germany has faced new problems due to recent immigration or immigration in general, but adopting Turkish style state-atheism or laws as it existed in the GDR while screaming the goo<b> d ol</b>d chant of \"raus\" will not solve any problems.\n\n\nAs for any foreigner outside of Germany actually worried about this, I don't think there's much to worry about. As Joseph Goebbels said, \"The Untermensch exists in all societies as a leavening agent to equalize all nations in degradation.\" \nExample:  [LINK] \n\n\nThe AfD has only gone through one election and it has lost its main founder and best spokespeople already. It is more of a protest party than anything else.",

The only 'aberration' I indulge in is not wearing socks in my sandals all year long because I do not feel cold in the feet and would have sweaty feet otherwise. And I rather play with my kids on the playground than sit motionless with the other parents on the bench. For this alone, all the right extreme parents sitting amongst other parents on the bench would want to send me into a concentration camp if they had the power. So, be not mistaken. Right extremism is not only about foreigners. It's about hate and trying to impose an absolute order which is suffocation for every system. It is NOT about solving problems.",

No countrymen likes to be taken over. \n\nLook at Mexico how they treat Haitians, at first they welcome them but once they started seeing how Haitians don't adapt to the Mexican culture you started seeing Mexicans being mad. \n\nMexicans are throwing a fit for a couple of hundreds of thousands Central Americans let alone millions.\n\nPreserve your culture and your identity. Don't be stupid, when I go to Germany. I want to see Germans, not Africans. No offense, but if I want to see Africans then I'll go to Africa. \n\nThere was a time when people travel to different cultures to see the different cultures and people that exist in every country. It's not fun when everyone looks the same in every country. \n\nThe European culture, please don't be so naive and take it for granted. Mexicans, Germans, Japanese, Egyptians have a right to preserve their culture and their identity.",

The war in Syria/Iraq is almost over, many refugees would want to go back to their homeland (who wouldn't) will begin to return. All that's going to be left are the college educated refugees who got a good paying job and don't want to go back. Which actually is very good for Germany in the long term. And another thing is that the stream of refugees will stop making the situation even better. So you shouldn't be complaining and be glad this is all starting to calm down. Although I find it ironic this was all a chain reaction 100 years in the making caused by the sikes-pico agreement made by the entente. Glad to see the French and British cucking Europe 2 times. Once at Versailles which caused World War 2 and the rise of communism. And now this 100 years later. Terrorism, ISIS, Saudi Arabia (which funded ISIS and Wahhabism which is a violent sect of Islam). All of these shouldn't have existed yet they do. Amazing just amazing...",

The AfD uses the arsenal of the opposition for frivolous inquieries that do neither control nor check the actions and decisions of the ruling parties. That job is still done by the left wing opposition and the ecological party.\nBut the AfD gives the ruling party an excuse to make more right wing, more oligarch-friendly decisions, usually against the interest of the 99%, and excusing those by saying they don't want to leave room for the right wing populists. Apparently by becoming more right wing populist themself.",

The last 2 elections had the AFD well below 15% and basically all other parties are pro european. Even the conservatives (Merkel) welcomes <b> refugee </b>and most Germans like that. So please don't intentionally paint a more dire picture than it is, we have seen how this can become a self fullfilling prophecy...",

                    "commentText": "\u200b@ben dover  Oh, I will happily give you some basic history classes, the type of classes that kids have at 11 or 12 in some countries where ppl are actually educated.\n1.  the Franco-Prussian war ( July 1870 - January 1871): The conflict oppose the French Empire and Republic and Italy to a large coalition of German states led by the Kingdom of Prussia. More than 1M of dead and wounded. This world war (sorry but USA wasn't there, and this war is still considered as a world war between 2 majors powers at that time), was lost by the French and led to some majors territorial losses such as the 2 French states known as Alsace and Lorraine. Those losses lead to what is known as the \"Great War\".\n2. the \"Great War\" (July 1914 - November 1918). This war was initiated by the assassination of archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo by some yougoslavists affiliated to the anarchists AND the German invasions of Belgium and France. This period represent the end of the European Empires in the XXth century and a need for revenge for a lot of europeans,  who where fed up with the \"German authority\", France wanted back the Alsace and Lorraine considered as occupied by germans, which was the case considering the fact that the people living there where always loyals to France. This war represent also the first time when the term of \"Allied\" was use as a result of the \"Triple Entente\" between Russia, France and UK opposed to the \"Triple Alliance\" between Italy, Germany and Austria (Bulgaria too, who was under German authority and the Ottoman Empire who plead allegiance to Germany and then became somehow the \"Quadruple Alliance\"). The \"Great War\" is the deadliest conflict in modern history (almost 100 M deaths world wide), the conflict spread because of the fact that germans never wanted to respect the territorial integrity of others European nations.\n3. WWII as the Americans called it first and the became an usual/easy term, (September 1939 - September 1945). This war was fulled by the deep German humiliation in the \"Great War\", the poverty that been caused for the Germans, a need for revenge, a <b> racist </b>ideology and the European cowardice, France collaborate with the<b>  nazi</b> Germany, mixed with some Italian fascism (Mussolini) and a Spanish civil war between republicans and the General Franco, also a fascist and a great friend of Hitler, USSR with Stalin who was a German allied until 1941, Japan at war with China since the 1920's and allied to Germany and USA who, after Pearl Harbor, in December 1941, join the \"Allies\" a.k.a. UK and USSR. \n\n\nSo yes, there are 3 world wars in the modern History, all caused by Germany at some levels. You're welcome.",

                    "commentText": "@Joan of Arc Alter I appreciate your optimism about the situation. And yes there are many great immigrants who come with very little, and succeed through hard work. But this situation is very different than the one you have in mind, one being legal immigration and two in controlled costed numbers. \n1. That gentleman who was assaulted by those Nazi's deserves justice. Those people that committed that crime should be prosecuted to the fullest extent. There is no place for violence and <b> racism.</b>  Unfortunately, in any population you will have people on either side of the political spectrum from Nazi's to anarchists. But the majority of people will be in the center of the distribution.\n2)Yes i agree. I personally know of people that have done so. I have no doubt some will. But the issue isn't that they can. The issue in the huge number in a short period of time. The resources required to coordinate, set up and teach German to thousands of people, while providing them food, shelter and living allowances isn't realistic. Government programs can only do so much. And the cost to provide all these things are on the backs of the taxpayer.\n3)Immigrants are famous for integrating ? Yes some are and others are not. In this case these people are literally coming with<b>  nothing</b> and with little to no family support. They are essentially a ward of the government ( tax payer funded). The infrastructure has to be in place to be able to provide and accommodate for these people. It really is not that simple. And the longer it takes to do so the harder it is to integrate and educate them. Some of them may need to go to college. You think all universities can admit that number over night? Do german citizens get disadvantaged because there would be a quota to educate thousands of new people, and thus less resources for german citizens? \n4.yes welfare is a safety net for those that really need it. What it is not is money for foreign aid. Which governments are  essentially having to do to pay for thousands of migrants until they are stable enough to take care of themselves. You are also hoping that these people want to succeed. Not all of them are going to b<b> e doctor</b>s. Does anyone know what kind of skills these people have? \n5. Ghetto, may have been a strong word. What i meant to say are areas where u have one culture completely dominate the native one to a point where it does not resemble the surrounding areas. You will see areas that have large numbers of migrants that are idle, such as coffee shops, malls etc where they associate only within their own groups. This drastically changes the demographics of the area. This does happen, check out Malmo, Sweden if you need a reference. \n6. It is very difficult for one to change cultural norms unless they are a child. Have u read about reports in Germany about safety officials telling women to cover up because they can't protect women from being sexually assaulted by migrants? In your own country officials are willing to have double standards? What happened to the feminists?  What kinds of people have they brought in? I have never heard of such things with legal immigrants before.  \n  7.There is a huge difference between a person from Ireland and a person from the middle east. They have a completely different value system. This isn't to say all europeans are great either, you have good apples with bad ones. If u transplant 1 million germans and put them in the middle of china do u think they will be able to \"integrate\" the way you describe as easy?",

Of course I can understand why people disliked it at the time and sure some things could have been handled better. But the thing is,  immigration isn't an urgent concern anymore. Immigration now is fraction of what it was back then. For some month more people are even leaving Germany than entereing it. Yet, 3 years later,  that is all the AfD and these people are talking about, making it the dominant topic in Germanys political diskussions blocking all other,more importent, issues. There is way to much focus  on immigration while we should really have discussion about the struggling pension and education system, health care, digitalisation and much more as well",

From other countrys (sweden) we know, that only a third of them has a job after 10 years. Its a huge strain on our econemy and gevourment budget.\n2. We already got a demographic problem in germany. But only in the german population. In the <b> immigrant </b>population (defined as first and second generation immigrants) there is no such problem. So even without immigration german population which ancestors lived here for hundreds and thousand of years will get a minority. Just trough having less babys than immigrants. It gets faster through immigration which is as last year about +400000 (came intro country minus went out of the country). Germany is changing and its not a small change. The population is changing and the culture is changing with it. If the trend countinues islam will get the predominant religion. You will always get resictance against such a change and it will rally behind far right groups because they have already always been against immigrants.\n\nIm a bid sad they did not talk about the eu. The afd was born from the eu crisis and immigrants is only their second topic.",

See Denmark and Sweden for example where the children of middle eastern immigrants are less integrated than their parents and see themselves as superior to the locals and above the law. But I'm sure the same thing is happening in Germany. You have been sold the lie that migrants would pay for your pensions, as if better solutions wouldn't exist, and you patted yourselves on the back for being kind and welcoming but in reality a large number of the immigrants despise you for being weak and that is exactly what they will pass on to their children. In the next 20-30 years there's probably going to be great civil unrest in most of Western Europe because of this.",

It seems the foreigner issue only becomes a real problem worth of protest when you have the wrong skin-tone and don't have the right \"look\" to be German. Another thing I noticed, during my stay as I lived in an <b> immigrant </b>heavy neighborhood in Berlin, because cheaper rents - I had a roommate that was a Syrian<b>  refugee</b> and another roommate that was from Iran. Never felt unsafe in my home, on the streets, and was treated with hospitality by everyone, Germans and immigrants. The vast majority of the immigrants I met (including my two roommates) spoke nearly fluent German too. In fact, I found pretty quickly that many foreigners from places like Australia, Uk etc. that had moved there didn't seem to have any intention of learning German (even though some had stayed for years), but everyone I met from a middle-eastern background was enrolled in German courses and studying it rigorously. I can't help but think thi<b> s immigran</b>t-hate comes with a heavy schema of what kind of people others imagine immigrants from the middle-east/north-africa as, and there's plenty of propaganda out there to make it all seem like they are all unethical criminals. It's important to remember in all of this the most people are just normal people, no matter what background. \n\nThat all said, I don't believe in open-door policies forever or do understand there is a limit to the capacity of migrants at a time that<b>  a nati</b>on can handle. But the Syria crisis was in fact an extreme situation, which lead to this influx in the first place. I don't agree that it makes any sense to create a threatening environment for other law-abiding people because you feel like they resemble other people who commit crimes. There has to be a peaceful and lawful solution to these things in the future.",

Every time 200 far-right protesters take to the streets, tens of thousands oppose them. The<b>  refugee</b> crisis continues, because of economic factors, war, crime and illegal smuggling (which is raking in millions for smugglers). So long as we do not address these problems, far-right groups will have a foothold in German politics. We need international solutions to international problems.

The pressure on housing, health services, increasing class sizes in public schools were kids with difficulties don't get a chance in their own country and public transport that crams people as cattle.

Germany and France are basically bankrolling the EU, and poor countries (like Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia) are benefiting from it. Plus, in the past few decades, more and more products are made in formerly poor nations like Romania, whose economies are growing. The EU pays them to care for refugees, many of whom are staying only temporarily. \"They (Germany) have let millions of people in deliberately into the EU\". Bollocks. The people entered through the EU borders, in places like Italy, Greece, Austria and Macedonia, NOT Germany. How is it Germany's fault that refugees came? If anything, the countries dropping bombs (US, Syria, Russia) are to blame. <b> Brexit </b>will only help the rich. The poor people, as always, will get screwed.

Your sentence is absolutely naive and stupid to say the least. Just read some basic books like Gustave LeBons \"Psychology of the masses\" or read some Nietzsche. You cannot create a human identity because we are to different. A poor chinese farmer has literally almost <b> nothing </b>in<b>  common</b> with a rich european CEO. There are only basic similarities, every culture should have it's right of existence, there is no need to forcefully merge nations and try to create a global government. Don't be a fool",

I agree that generally speaking we should have some kind of human-patriotism that binds us, but we need <b> nationalism </b>and the acceptance of national identity and racial and cultural differences first because we can establish a meaningful and harmonic relationships between all humans worldwide, just compare the USA with countries like Japan or Switzerland and Iceland, homogenous countries are always more peacefull und unviolent then multicultural ones.",

For example the AfD's  and  the  general electorate's East West divide and its historical origins weren't mentioned. These right wing nuts are a tiny, yet disgusting minority, among other radicals ( left wing, right wing, islamists). Generally the former have no  party affiliation. AfD was founded upon the Euro/ economic crisis . Etc etc etc Badly researched, factually imprecise, insinuating the status quo is worse than it actually is. Thereby fearmongering and stiring hatred. Just look at the recent elections. The vast majority of the German people voted for liberal middle to  left wing parties. Don't  get me wrong we have to fight these c**ts with everything we got. But in the great scheme of things they are a rather insignifiant pain in the behind. We need a more stoic debate about the issues of our time. Videos like these are unhelpful to say the least. Disappointing NYT, you are better and more professional than this.",

Although, there have been many changes throughout history, referring to territories and the people who occupy them, they have been fought for. Countless amounts of people have died fighting for what they believe in and for their right to claim the lands, cultivating it and building a civilized society. It is not an easy task. If it were, then people all over the globe would be content with where they reside. It is completely unfair  to have had generations upon generations create (through bloodshed) a place for your family to exist, to have it completely overturned to individuals that are of no benefit to your society. These people (refugees) should be completely capable to create a civilization of their own, yet are too lazy to put in the years and years of work to do so. EVERY 1st WORLD CIVILIZATION on this planet has had to go through these obstacles to achieve what they have today, the best countries in the world..... BUT now others want their cut. They literally have the REST of the WORLD to make their own. Why should others, who have already accomplished these feats, have to give up what was earned by their families blood???? Its not about <b> racism,</b> it's about what's fair. If people want to help others, that's fine. Do so, but don't you dare attack the people that want to protect their territory and preserve their culture.",

Or support more freedom for the large corporations to do what they want and thus exploit both the environment and the human inhabitants of the Third World even more, important factors that cause immigration? Most importantly, how can right-wing politicians defend their nationalist response to mass immigration, when the very causes of immigration are not only international, but also caused directly by wealthy and influential people in these countries which now suddenly act all surprised that they are \"under attack\" by \"hordes\" from the Middle East?

What i know is that if religion and ideology gets mixed with politcs it does not end well.(see inqusition,<b>  witch</b> hunt<b> , india</b>n genocide etc.) That is because institutionalised religion is a missuse of power. And the heads of these institutions missuse the spirituality of the people to gain more power and that often ends in violence. So i dont blame the people, the believers of a religion i blame the key figures, these snakes that are in control. On the other side the root of such problems are not only on one side. If people with a certain identity or religion get discriminated and experience violence against them it will cause them to radicalise. Violence creates violence. If one force pushes in one direction another force will push against it. Thats a universal law and who caused this inballance is hard to say.",

It's insane to partition land and hand out declarations ex nihilo (like that by Lord Balfour) and to not expect some push. It's a bit beyond chutzpah, actually. Yes, most civilizations are based on violence and conquest (and Israel was founded in blood, look up Irgun and other proto-Zionist movements) and that's the way the world works, but it's insane to think that the people who were already there will die or allow themselves to be second-class without at least fighting (i.e. the Native Americans here). It's not so much the Jewish tribalism that's grating, since tribalism is pretty normal; it's the hypocrisy, and begrudging everyone else this instinct.",

We know full well what happens in that country when the REAL far-right runs it, these people are NOT that. Theyre just sick of seeing their country turn into a slum, and that makes them nazis? If that makes someone a <b> nazi,</b> I guess Im one too. See here the folly of calling everything you disagree with<b>  nazi</b>, eventually that word loses its meaning and no one cares if you call them that. There are some, you bet, but they arent protesting, theyre vandalizing and assaulting. It also takes away profoundly from the true horror that was Hitler, but you wouldnt know about that, historys a bit of a sore spot for lefties. Hitler is just another boogeyman to you, to far too many, like my family, hes the reason they (and I) have so few relatives.",

Unlike the US, Germany has a more limited experience with non-european migration and we are quickly becoming a very divers country. That is a huge change. In 2015 Germany took in about 2,6 % of it's Population or 2,1 Million migrants (of whom 1 million were refugees).

That is a mistake because, as you said, the wrong people pay the price for that. \nBut, when refugees are coming to your doorstep, either by crossing the Mediterranean Sea or via turkey and the Balkan, what should you do? Turn them around? We did not invite anyone, but I think we did the right thing, so has Turkey (although it had even less of a choice). The challenge rather is how to tell who says the truth and who has just a 'cool backstory'? And that's where policies fail.  \n\n\n\nBy the way the German government is FINALLY working on a catalogue of migration laws that are supposed to make migration from educated non-European countries to Germany more transparent and easier.",

Compared to the Republicans in America, Shinzo Abe's LDP, or many mainstream European parties, the AfD is a leftwing party on most issues. A few decades ago, the same German \"moderate\" parties that are now in the Bundestag did not even accept the border with Poland. If you are living in today's Germany, you might not realize that similar views are normal in most countries. Americans talk of themselves as the \"exceptional\" or \"indispensable\" <b> nation.</b> China is the \"middle kingdom\". The USA, Japan, Turkey, China...  actually any<b>  nation</b> has a very different relationship to the massacres they committed. Germany has changed far more than the rest of the world. By any objective measure, we are a far left country<b> . Nationalis</b>m is the global norm, not the exception.\n\nTuran G\u00f6kb\u00f6r\u00fc\nI am a \"Biodeutscher\". I know more well-integrated migrants who agree with you than Germans :D \nThat's partly because they know other cultures better than the Germans. For example, their are huge differences between Turkish and Arab migrants in terms of education and criminal behaviour, but the Germans just see them as Muslim and don't  realize it. \nAnother reason is what you touched on: Well-integrated people like you could have had a nice future in Germany. But you will experience more prejudice now, because the problematic migrants look like you. I even hear of more and more Turkish academics who want to go back to Turkey.",

And that's just the people speaking out. I think in Germany the \"silent majority\" is anti-right, and this sentiment is stronger than in other countries because of our history. Even people who have concerns about the immigration politics have scruple to vote for the AfD because of their rhetoric. \nAlso the rise of the greens in the past two state elections I think is a symptom of this: people who didn't vote for the greens before (because they think their not compatible with our economy/industry) vote for them now to take a stance against the right (also against the groko, but that's another story).",

In Germany we have a party system but the Government has since the establishment of the federal Republic only be run by one of the two 'Volksparteien' (Volk is like the Population: they are pretty general parties which try to represent a lot of spectrums in their midst, however they used to be distinguishable by one of them, the SPD (social democrats) being more social - although I think the conservatives had a lot of social program points also - and the other, already mentioned Conservative party CDU/CSU being more conservative: like representing tradition, etc.) in coalition with a smaller party: back in the day mainly the fdp (the liberals) then the greens, I think once the conservatives even ruled by themselves on the federal level; however recently they both have been losing support (the social democrats more than the conservatives in accumulation, the csu/csu lost the most voters in the past federal election though) so they decided to coalition with each other, last year for the second legislative period in a row, plus under Merkels first legislative period there was also a great coalition, the thing is just that politics become really empty under them because there's no alternative which is strong enough:\nWhich is why now I think smaller parties in general but particularly the greens and the afd have new supporters because people just crave change: in the past two state elections the greens hav surpassed the social democrats, I don't know if this trend is going to continue but it's interesting to say the least.",

No Arabs or blacks or Indians or Asians are being told that they HAVE to share their homelands with other races of people. It's lead to full on TYRANNY against the citizens BY THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT. Arresting people for political reasons and turning contradicting political stances into HATE SPEECH. This is madness and this is just the beginning. It's insanity. No one is telling Israel and Saudi Arabia they need diversity. White Christians and western civilization have been stabbed in the back. Trump is a liberal compared to what is coming.

Even if not one of them showed the<b>  Nazi</b> greeting, everyone only walks through the streets and commemorates the victims. The true patriots despise the Nazis. Is this shown in the public media?  Reports are cheerfully cut together. A politician from the government's own ranks dared to publicly contradict the Chancellor: \"There were no hunts in Chemnitz!  What happened as a result? He was removed from his post. \nAs Germans you always have this terrible story with you.  But we cannot do anything for our history, that was before our time, and must never repeat ourselves. No genocide must be forgotten.\nBut we may take to the streets for Germany. Peaceful protest, violence destroyed and achieved only the opposite. \nMany years ago there was this terrible incident at a home for asylum seekers in Solingen. This is still being commemorated publicly today.  Even Mrs. Merkel arrived. And we must not draw attention to the German victims and publicly mourn them?\nI simply cannot understand why Mrs Merkel has such power. \nNow Austria has also decided against the migration pact. In Germany, petitions have no power? They are not published in order not to unsettle the population? \nWe are still an occupied country, aren't we? Peace treaties are a no-no.

And that I work with a language translator.\nAll those who go peacefully on the street are not the 'bad tattooed' Germans. There are always Nazis who use the situation and 'show themselves'.  But they don't belong to the citizens who take to the streets for their country. Because these citizens who fight for Germany belong to all classes and <b> age </b>groups. \nThe 'Right' mourn for a victim who was himself a 'leftist' and was killed by immigrants. And these leftists disturb the funeral march and celebrate parties near the crime scene.  \nPlease tell me one thing.  Who is on the right side?\nIn Germany, citizens take to the streets because they are afraid.  We want to help people in need.  It's about illegal immigration, about policies that forget their own people. We have pensioners collecting bottles, there are an unspeakable number of children living on the poverty line, we no longer feel safe in our home country and we are afraid.  As a<b>  woman</b>, I had to experience for myself that a 'NO' for immigration counts fo<b> r nothin</b>g. We are against the Migration Pact. \nMr. Trump says, \"America first.\"  You may say frankly that your borders will be made for you.  Build the wall. You don't sign this pact. Are you Nazis? No. And we may for ours. You fight for your state and your sovereignty.  You want controlled immigration. \nAnd we can't take to the streets for our country?  We want the same thing, and are Nazis?\nWhoever enlightens on the Internet will be censored or even completely blocked. \nWe are desperate, and our ruling politicians are not for us but against us.\nLovley regards.",

But you can see videos where this peacefull people applaude while refuge shelters burn and get attacked and call it democracy. They attack the press like facists. You know that. \n\nAbout the mourning you just exploited the death of a young man how can you call ''wir sind das Volk'' and ''L\u00fcgenpresse'' chanting mourning. The afd and pegida just used this events to chant there usual rhetoric. Im sorry but this people had no respect at all for the victim there was so much hate there. Also the Pegida and the afd have lots of people that came from the npd and other organisations that are clearly involved with the neonazi scene. There are always so many neonazis at this events it's not just some single ones. And they help to organize and push this stuff.\n\nYes the people that chant build the wall and are fearmongering against migrants are Nazis. You just saw what happend after years of spreading anti news and anti leftwing propaganda some guy send bombs.After years of spreading anti-jewish conspiracy theories a guy shot people in a synagoge. This is what happens if you empower this kind of people.\n\n''Whoever enlightens on the Internet will be censored or even completely blocked. We are desperate, and our ruling politicians are not for us but against us.''\n\nThat is exactly the kind of conspiracy stuff and lies and fearmongering im talking about. It's not true people get censored or blocked for hate speech.\n\nBtw im not American ;)",

Regarding economy the \n- CDU is a neoliberal party that supports wellfare for the rich and banks, but cuts down wellfare for the poor.\n- SPD calls itself social, but under cancellor Schr\u00f6der was even more neoliberal than the CDU, effectively halfing taxes on effordless capital gain and corporate taxes. They never dissociated themself from this policy.\n- FDP is slightly more neoliberal as the CDU, but less conservative.\n- The green party is also called the banana-party. Yesterday green (environmentalist), today <b> yel<b> low<b>  </b</b</b>>>(neoliberal), tomorr<b> ow bla</b>ck (neoliberal conservative)\n- Left... main goal is reversing the neoliberal tax reforms from Schr\u00f6der. So they basically want what we already had 25 years ago with the CDU under Kohl. Not sure a party that aims for 1990s conservative politics can be called \"left\" just because all other parties made a big step towards Mont P\u00e8llerin Society style neoliberalism during the last 20 years.\n\nWe do have a broad spectrum of choice in social politics, but a rather slim one regarding economics.",

I think you need to pick up a history book or research the political climate of today... \nThis is the retaliation of the native German people having their culture, history and values dissolved by the globalist, far left governments. The new immigrants do not integrate due to the culture and judicial systems, derived of their un-modern faiths, of their foreign lands.\n\nMaybe this is too hard for your far left brain to handle but European countries are not homogenous, they're diverse and people want to keep it that way rather than dissolving and mixing them away. After all what makes Germany, German... not a middle eastern Islamic surge of people with foreign culture, history and values.",

If you care so much about the diversity of human beings, why are you pushing agendas that result in the dissolving of all culture, history and people... \nJust admit that you have no culture, people or history that you align with or cherish, thus have no personal issue in losing it all. \nAll you do is illogically regurgitate the same far left \u2018virtuous' words to impose your agenda.\n\nAnother ironic point, that only shows your lack of knowledge for the current political climate, is how you say people can \u2018share culture' yet the sheep of your own far left agenda would say that it is \u2018cultural appropriation'.\n\nI completely contest your statement that diverse nations equates to a nation's strength... frankly multiculturalism has never worked and always caused the demise of a nations stability, security and safety (statistically), culture and historical origin. \nYou love to play the narrative that white Europeans \u2018need these immigrants' yet our nation's were strong before hand, built and populated by us natives... must I really give you a history lesson of Europe? Pick up a book and realize even the smallest of our European nations were the worlds strongest such as Britain having an empire which conquered most of the world (this being one of a million points).\nDiversity = loss of native culture, history and values.\n\nThe most uneducated, illogical comment you made yet is that Muslims and Christians could integrate with each other.... this is only true if the followers of islam, in Europe, choose to modernize and assimilate their values to the modern, western, progressive values built upon and modernized of Christianity. \nIslam and Christianity are both theocratic ideologies which inherently have different values, producing different cultural values in which contradict and cause immense tension. My point proven being the fact Muslims and Christians have mostly never gotten along historically to present day and slaughtered each other by the millions. \nBelieve it or not the progressive native Europeans want Islamic immigrants to assimilate their values, in order to integrate. This isn't possible when they immigrate by the masses and whole communities and cultural values change to that of the new Islamic immigrants this isn't diverse and it isn't progressive as the immigrant's values are oppressive, misogynistic, cause crime, no-go zones and completely contradict the lifestyle and values of native Europeans. This is reflective of the instability and culture of the immigrant's homelands. They literally migrate and bring all their problems with them. \n\nThe diversity argument has absolutely no substance, is hypocritical and unprogressive. You're another deaf-blind sheep who sees no value in Europe, other than the money it has.",

But the difference is that a patriot loves his country, what it stands for. To be a nationalist is to love your own<b>  ethnicity</b> ( this is the case for most nationalists) its more philosophical, youre not as blinded by loyalty as a patriot is, to you ideology matters strongly, and also who sits in the government.",

Because of what it stands for. What does it stand for? Individual liberty and freedom. What will he fight for? The right to choose, bear guns etc. Lets say half the american population thinks like this. Do they have to become nationalists? They dont need to.\n\nPatriotism in the modern sens didnt exist before the europeans first established the reality of <b> nationality </b>following the french revolution and napoleon. You dont have to first be a patriot to become a nationalist. A future to be nationalist doesnt necessarily have to start out buying products made in his country for the sake of it to later start an armed insurrection against his government because he doesnt like the ideology that runs it.",

The right-wing acknowledges that people are not equal, thereby rejecting egalitarianism. \n\nThe Republicans and Democrats obviously don't care about anyone.

If they did, they wouldn't have abandoned the white working class in favor of <b> ethnic,</b> religious, and<b>  sexual</b> minorities. They use social programs as a means to steal money from the citizens and hand it back to them as a bribe for votes. \n\nThe Republicans are honestly just progressives that are decades behind the cultural revolution.

Even if you never descend from your rock, when your god-bled blood flows in disgrace and pain over the earth, suffer, suffer the great blessing given to the few, the strong. Rings are no longer for luck, because you have another choice. Not revenge, not institutions, not power and not prosperity buy you. Be what you were, what you should be, what you should never forget. Be hate and do not hate, be ridiculed and do not defend yourself.\n\n\n\n\"Simson Germany! Your eye is <b> blind,</b> your forehead is<b>  bald</b>. Turn your gaze into yourself, turn your titanic power against yourself. You will not break the pillars of the earth. The court is not yours. Turn the mill of the Philistines and sing the song of God.\n\nAhasver Germany! You do not have power to die. German feet will move across the earth and seek home. You will eat a bitter bread and your home will not be your home. From strange doors they will hunt you for the reflection in your tired eyes.\n\nO you Germany! Loved in your foolish delusion, tenfold loved in your godforsaken madman and vice, ten thousand times loved in your humiliating suffering, what do you know of your fate? ...\n\nYou are arrested and lapsed, and when the hands of men let go of you, you fall into the hands of God.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nSource: Walther Rathenau in \"Critique of the Triple Revolution\", p. 67/77\n\nIve asked myself why the elite is targeting germany/germans the most and ve found out really corious stuff.\n\nThe Germans were the Assyrians.\n\nBefore emigrating to Europe, they lived in the near of the Caspian <b> / Blac</b>k Sea. After the Assyrian kingdom fell, they migrated along t<b> he Bla</b>ck Sea to the river Moselle in Germany. There they also built the first European city called Trier. Trier is 1300 years older than Rome. This is how it stands in Latin on <b> the<b>  </b</b>>red house in Trier.\n\nIn the past they invented the wheel and in the modern day the car.\n\nThe Germans/Assyrians are called in the bible as \"gods hands and the root of his anger. They are the sword of god. Jahwe said that the assyrian king (the next chancellor maybe) will be the one who leads the beast (political system/EU), will fight against Jahwe. \n\nShort Version: Who is Jahwe? \nThe creator god of the egyptian believe was named \"El Schaddai\" and not jahwe. Moses was maybe a egyptian pharao (Tutmoses III) who connected to a creature which is described on the Kabbalah as a desert demon with the name jahwe. \nSo i guess they are the good guys and not the bad ones.",
