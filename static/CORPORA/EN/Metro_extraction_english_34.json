        "postText": "Hello, and welcome to another edition of \u2018absolutely wild and crazy toxic masculinity news\u2019. I am your host, and I am confused.', 'A video online has gone viral that suggests enjoying women\u2019s bums in a sexual sense is a gateway to homosexuality.', 'Men\u2019s rights activist RooshV \u2013 real name Daryush Valizadeh \u2013 claims that he \u2018says no to the back hole\u2019, and won\u2019t put his \u2018benis\u2019 near somewhere with \u2018doo-doo\u2019 \u2013 because apparently having anal sex with a woman is \u2018gross\u2019 and has some sort of bearing on his sexuality.', 'It\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s satire given that Roosh previously advocated for making rape legal on private property (although he later backtracked and said this was a thought experiment) and has refused to do interviews with journalists unless they perform sex acts on him.', 'He\u2019s also written articles on how women are like bread, bath tubs, and t-shirts, how contraception prevents love, and how women\u2019s only purpose is to reproduce.', 'Plus, it comes on the back of the revelation that there are men who won\u2019t wipe their own asses properly for fear of seeming gay. So not totally out of the realms of imagination.', 'Female butt obsession is a gateway to homosexuality. pic.twitter.com/H8cFAX62x9', '\u2014 Roosh (@rooshv) January 28, 2019', 'Let\u2019s assume this isn\u2019t another one of his \u2018hilarious\u2019 thought experiments and take him for his word.', 'If that\u2019s the case, he genuinely believes that liking a body part of a woman as a man would be in some way homosexual.', 'While funny in a grim sort of way, #nohomo culture can genuinely confuse young people into thinking they don\u2019t know their own mind when it comes to their sexuality or that there\u2019d be anything wrong with them not being straight.', 'So, in case you hadn\u2019t been aware yet, there is nothing wrong with being gay, but men liking women is certainly not gay.', 'He also thinks it\u2019s disgusting since it\u2019s where people rid themselves of bodily waste. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s heard, but waste is also excreted from his very own benis\u2026 And yet he still expects people to go near that? Interesting.', 'There are a lot of questions we have after the video. Why is the banana on his microwave dressed in a towel? Why is he drinking from a disposable cup when he\u2019s sitting in his house? Why is he so scared of his own back hole?', 'Some questions are just too vast to be answered. And best never thought about ever again.",

And yes, men's rights activists exist because they are necessary, even more so than you know because humans are naturally lacking in empathy towards men, its why they are the majority of homeless, its why we can spend their lives in war without a second thought.  This is the evolved response, and it results in gross levels of <b> sexism.</b> Just look at the university system where women have been the majority of students for many years now, and still there are affirmative action programs and exclusive scholarships and other programs only for them, with no male counterpart.  MRA's whether you like it or not have a point.And people who throw pick up artists like roosh under the bus to save themselves really should know better by now. They will lie about Roosh, and once they are done with him, they will lie about you, this is how they work.",

They claim that male politicians have no place in deciding over women's bodies.  Ok, to be consistent then female politicians should have no say in war because that is a decision to spend the blood of men.  \"my body my choice\" but not my responsibility.  Remember the argument for abortion is that its wrong to force parenthood upon a <b> woman,</b> yet this is exactly what they are doing to men.  And they've even check mated themselves on conception, because they have already claimed that<b>  sex</b> isn't consent to parenthood.  There is endless hypocrisy, too long to even go into here in a post.",
