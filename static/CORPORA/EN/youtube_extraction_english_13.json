Men and women have the same rights on paper, but that doesn't get into many heads and so equality is still not reached",

Must Watch.   [LINK] \nPublished on May 22, 2013  Feminists and other leftists are useful idiots who serve only to destabilise the society. When the goal is reached, they will be \"lined up against the wall\". \n\n [LINK] \n1984 interview with a former KGB agent and Soviet diplomat, Yuri Bezmenov.\nReminds me of the many reports regarding American and Canadian daughters of a bitches in America and Canada which is an overboard political correctness cultural marxism country which we Russians created to destroy the American and Canadian family. destroy the family then you destroy the brick of society, destroy many bricks then the entire building goes down. \n\nThat building is the American and Canadian<b>  nation</b> and we of the former KGB now known as the FSB are very proud of what we just did and you Canadians and Americans think you won the cold war? No! We russians won the cold war for we have destroyed the western family! Destroy the family then society collapses, when society collapses then the economy collapses, when the economy that supports the military collapses then all U.S and Canadian militaries collapses.\n\nWe Russians won the Cold War for look at your societies, over 50% divorce rares, out of control insane feminism, indiscrimination against the while caucasian mal<b> e gende</b>r in all walks of life, the feminization of education in order to destroy  the intellectual a<b> nd ment</b>al potentials of boys and men by deliberately ignoring their educational and intellectual needs by ignoring the difference of thinking pattern between male and female, open and outright  indiscrimination against male co-workers in the work place and places of learning, etc.\n\nPolitical correctness is TYRANNY WITH A SMILE. PC particularly serves mediocre politicians and the bureaucrats they appoint.  It is used to hold on to jobs, silencing critics and threatening anyone who questions their abilities.  If the offended party can strike back with accusation<b>  of rac</b>ism, discrimination, prejudice, and hatred, then PC has done its job.  PC is a way of covering up incompetence and corruption.  It has worked well in the U.S. for decades: attack the accuser.  Benjamin Jealous, president of the NAACP, wrote, \"Let me tell you something about political correctness: when politicians start overdoing it with PC, rest assured they're either hopeless at what they do or have screwed everything up big time.",

Equality would be for everyone to get treated just as good or bad as the other <b> gender.</b> Human is human and the way you get treated should be depending on the way you act and not what<b>  gender</b> you are. Young man and women should work together to create real equality and to give neither women nor man a better treatment.",

            "commentText": "I glance at this out of curiosity, and saw a sign saying we haven't needed feminism since 1920.  Well I'm ignorant of the importance of the dates so I did a little self education.   1920 is when most western countries gave women the vote.  Two years earlier the gave women over [30]?  The vote.  So I was thinking what changed to give women the vote.  Well what changed is that after sacrificing millions of <b> common </b>men's lives in ww1 the nobility and land owners who were the only ones that could vote (surprisingly true for women land owners to) had no leg to stand on to deny these men the vote, after all it was the<b>  common</b> mans sacrifice that enable these countries to still have the lands and titles they enjoy.  So after th<b> e commo</b>n man got to vote those same men who toiled endlessly in conjunction with their wives to feed, cloth and educate their children, well they went to the grind stone and bolstered the suferget movement and 2 years after men had the vote so did women.   So i was perplexed, why the big stink on not getting the vote for women when essentially they got the right a very short time after all men.  Now I know it's not the same for all countries that were allies in ww1 but In general women got the vote because of male sacrifice of lives elevated a<b> ll comm</b>on people.  Kinda sucked the wind from the sales of feminist outrage when looked at this way.",

It's those kinds of accounts that are telling people how to try combatting climate change. They stand up for people around the world.

I support social justice and<b>  gender</b> equality, and any label that someone uses who wants to accomplish that is fine with me, whether it's feminist, anti-feminist, MRA, egalitarian, etc. Some labels have a better track record than others but I've found it's much better to actually talk to individual people rather than vilify an entire label, since these labels in particular contain vastly different ideas within them.",

            "commentText": "Some thoughts from a male, aged in his fifties, who was alive when feminism's Second Wave was coming to be, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. I saw that time period, first-hand, so I can say this with absolute certainty: the idea that's going around, today, that feminism has, all of a sudden, stopped being something \"good\" and is now suddenly \"toxic,\" is wrong-headed. That is a very misguided, anti-rational, anti-facts concept. It is inconsistent with provable history. That idea is, at best, a belated admission that feminism has been toxic, since the 1960s / 1970s -- but without actually admitting that, yes, some feminist leaders were always 100% BatSh*t.\n\nTake the incredibly insane words and thoughts of feminist leader / writer, Caroline Hennessey, as just one example. She wrote two books, that initially were highly praised and were widely accepted by women, all over. She not only advocated violence against men, but advocated for Guerilla Warfare against corporations; cutting men's body parts off; etc., etc., etc. And she did all that in 1970 (with her first book) and 1971 (with her second book). See my online reviews over on Amazon <b> dot </b>com, to see what men have been facing for the past five decades or so. Note that I have made most of my points not through my stated opinions, but through page scans of the completely insane, male-hating, massively-entitled crap that author shoveled:\n\nProof of insane 1970s hatred, by women, against men:\n\nAmazon book reviews of Caroline Hennessey's \"I, B.I.T.C.H.\" book:\n\n [LINK] \n\nAmazon book reviews of her book, \"The Strategy of<b>  Sexual</b> Struggle\":\n\n [LINK] \n\nAnd for bonus points:\n\nProof of insane 2018 hatred, by women, against men:\n\n [LINK] \n\nThere you go -- now, you can educate any portion of feminism that can be educated. Simply show them the facts, above (or, better yet, ladies, write your own reviews of such horrible books; making your displeasure with the craziest feminists crystal clear, for all to see) ... which will more than likely bring out the aforementioned craziest feminists, for your future \"talks\" with the insane and toxic people we men have tried, without success, to reason with for ages.\n\nPersonally, I think that holding up \"we don't like feminism\" signs won't cure the problem. Filling up jet airliners with known feminist leaders, and shipping them to Saudi Arabia, against their will, so they can live in a real<b>  \"Patriarch</b>y,\" might begin to actually resolve some problems that feminist leaders won't even acknowledge exist; let alone, that they have caused for humanity.\n\nAs this individual sees things: as long <b> as cra</b>zy leaders remain in the same powerful positions they have been in, for decades, many of us men will happily remain \"MGTOW For Life\". We're not going to share our homes; our beds; our resources. We're going to intentionally segregate ourselves from the harmful narcissists, all around us, and call it a male \"awakening\" and/or a male \"emancipation\" -- or just call it \"well deserved peace and quiet, after decades of abuse\".\n\nMany men are going to remain \"No Contact\" as regards women -- for the rest of our lives. Five decades of horrific abuses, and the Complex-PTSD women caused men to have, tends to do that. Many men are fed up. Many Men are abandoning women to their fates. \"Thank feminism\" in whatever way you women deem appropriate: but realize that some things, once broken, are never going to go back to being what they once were. MGTOW exists, to protect men; and our numbers are growing, daily. MGTOW doesn't even have to recruit: feminism does that for us. Each and every bit of lunacy or hate they spew, takes more men away from not only toxic and hate-filled women, but away from ALL women at ALL times. (\"It's not sexist: it's survivalist\"!)",

I'm sorry if you don't like the word but if its called Feminism is because women invented this movement for equal rights. Being feminist doesn't mean I believe all man are rapists, NO, i jus want equality and if someone told you Feminism was about bringing man down they are not right, It's really sad that people still don't understand the word. Also, you can't say I'm not \u03b1 feminst but respect my opinion, why? Cause if you arr not \u03b1 feminist means you don't want equality and if you don't want equality you are disrespecting the other <b> gender,</b> wich means you can't ask for respect when your opinion is about not respecting.",

The only reason you're in your position and not in the position of other girl that's being treated like a possession, an object or someone of lesser intelligence, is because of this fight that we as feminists are still a part of. How dare you throw that back in our faces? \n\nYou may no longer feel the need for feminism personally, but that is only because you're thinkink of what the movement can do for you, and not what it hopes to achieve for everyone.\n\nYou have the advantage of living in a world shaped by people who have made it better for you, do not turn around and decide that if you're no longer affected by the issue then the issue has resolved itself. That the problema is gone. You're using a position of privilege to choose to be ignorant.\n\nYou're saying, in effect, that because you feel feminism cannot do any more for you as an individual, that the push for change is no longer needed. You're living without <b> gender </b>constraints, so why should you care what happens to anyone else?\n\nFine, you no longer need feminism.

It's a <b> common </b>misconception that we hate men or think we are superior to them when in fact we just want to be equal. It is fair saying we don't need feminism anymore as we are all equal yet for me as a girl I don't feel equal to men in the slightest. There are still issues of the<b>  gender</b> pay gap that is trying to be tackled by the British government here in the UK and I have talked with my MP Hillary Ben about the steps towards equal pay. I believe there are times where both genders aren't treated equally and women suffer abuse and discrimination for thei<b> r gende</b>r and/<b> or ethnici</b>ty. However, I do respect these women against feminism as people can have their own opinions and I support free speech in every way but personally I believe we have the right to choose whether we are a feminist or not and shouldn't be shamed for it. The majority of people in these comments are one sided and for one or the other yet I think our upbringing and experiences lead us to what we believe. I<b> f a wo</b>man grows up without being discriminated, it isn't hard to see why they would be against feminism however for someone like me who suffers social injustice everyday due t<b> o my ge</b>nder and is friends with people who experience the same, I stand by feminism all the way as it makes me feel empowered and helps to conquer the inequality I face.",

Feminism's stated goal is to destroy \"the <b> patriarchy\"</b>.  What does that mean?  It means to destroy western society and replace it with Marxism.  All feminists are left-wing socialists.  Since feminism has become mainstream back in the early 1970s, women's level of happiness has continued to decline.  Women are way less happy than they were 40 years ago.  Feminism is the reason.",

There are countries out there that could use their support but to sit on their <b> fat </b>arses acting like they're oppressed in the USA or Australia is a bit of a joke! There's a reason why more men are seeking wives outside of their country and feminism is a part of it. Telling us what we can and can't say and don't defend yourself or you're \"Mansplaining\" we can't sit with our legs open despite having a penis and testicles because we're \"Manspreading\" challenging us at every opportunity like we're a burden on society simply for being men. I can tell you on behalf of most men of the west we'd rather look beyond our own borders to find a<b>  woman</b> who can appreciate and validate us that's why it's more popular than ever before. Mark my words this is only the beginning but feminism is destroying relationships for women in western countries which leaves the door wide open for a lot of single ladies out there from foreign land and perhaps they will inherit the earth in the end.",

The <b> feminazi </b>we see today are not feminists. They hate men. What bothers me the most is that instead of attacking the women who wrongly apply feminism they attack the very concept of feminism. So they include in the same bag the<b>  crazy</b> women who think they are superior than men and the real feminists who truly believe in equality. In fact when I read their comments I noticed that some of these women REALLY DON'T believe in equality (maybe for religious reasons). So my point is these women should not be using the word feminist in the video because their message will produce hate towards those who are truly feminists because people will think that they ar<b> e feminaz</b>i while they are not",

Even if you type feminism into Google the first result is the definition \"the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes.\" Women have equal if not more rights than men do. In the U.K, America, Canada and Australia Women are the freest and most liberated in the world. What more honestly is there to be done? All I hear feminists moan about is the pay gap (which has been proven wrong time and time again but they still don't listen) and more trivial things like mansplaining and manspreading (Which someone was actually arrested for) I know I'm going into the extreme third wave \"<b> Feminazi\"</b> feminism for examples but for a word that means different things to different people I'd rather just stick with the word that means what it means. \nEgalitarianism: \"the doctrine that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities\" \n\nI'm not tarring all feminists with the same brush, My Ex girlfriend was a feminist and she was lovely. As I say There are feminists that I like as per mentioned Christina Hoff sommers and also, this is annoying me I have her face in my head but I cannot for the life of me think of her name, by the time I send this I'll remember and edit the comment with her name ;]\n\nNo one is stopping women from working Blue collar jobs, And you know what I totally encourage that, I've seen female plumbers and electricians. Just that the majority of women don't go for that line of work. Same way men don't tend to go for teaching and nursing jobs.",

It is the Suffragettes who threaten violence towards others and not the other way around. In fact the majority of the state was supportive of their cause. The The Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) or The Suffragettes as they are more widely known were a group of mostly upper-class wealthy and aristocratic women, all of them white, most of them racists who had the support of the majority of the British government at the time they were protesting for their \"right to vote\". They resorted to violence and terrorism and attacking the police as part of their campaign. In response to this violence and terrorism (they bombed places and burned houses down) the police arrested some of them before quickly realising them. Two years into their campaign the WSPU was disbanded by its leaders after having been bribed with a substantial amount of money\u00a0to do so\u00a0by Stanely Baldwin's Conservative government. They quickly proceeded to\u00a0turn the WSPU\u00a0into an agency for the government for recruiting men into the first world war. They lead the white feather campaign where members were encouraged to go around sticking white feathers on young boys and men on the streets of the UK to brand them as cowards for not enlisting in the war....as a result of this campaign tens of thousands of men were pressured into war and death.\n\n\nFeminism is an ideology built by liars on an ocean of lies. The BBC is a mouth piece for feminist distortion and lies. 92% of women refuse to identify with feminism in the UK.  Join us! Stand up to <b> sexism.</b> Stand up to feminism. Join the anti-feminist movement, which has been growing exponentially for almost 150 years now. Lets put an end to this highly destructive ideology that is feminism!",

So I don't believe anit-feminist women they know they over reached and got greedy. So they are changing the ractices to get men to come back. The juice is not worth the squeeze. Jist go MGTOW.

Feminism is men and women being treated EQUALLY!!!!!! Like we're NOT a toy to be played with! We are every bit as good as men. Not better, not worse. EQUAL!!!! And men should respect that like we respect them! They don't understand it cause they've always been raised to tower over women, and control them... And that they can do ANYTHING the want in this world!!!!! What do they teach girls? \"Put your glass slippers on and your tiara, get married have kids and know that you belong in the kitchen.\" \n\nWell I'm DONE with that!! And I know firsthand what this is like because my dad is sexist, and always taught me what is in quotes up there. YOU. BELONG. IN. THE. KITCHEN.......\n\nWELL NOT ANYMORE! \n\nWatch me. I'll go higher in this world than my dad would ever want me to. I'll get a job better than he ever had. I'll make a point that no one will ever forget. And later in life when you see that independent <b> woman </b>on tv, and in the papers setting an example for little girls.....that will be me!",

ALL girls in underdeveloped countries  being able to get an education instead of being forced out of school to get married and have babies. As in girls in their teens being sexualised by dress codes social media. Feminism is just a word I don't see why people get so riled up by it.

Here are a few pointers to get anyone who may be interested started on the research:\n\n1st wave: look up a video called \"suffragettes - terrorism & lies\" & research the Emmiline Pankhurst & The White Feather movement.\n\n2nd wave: look up a very important article called \"marxist feminism's ruined lives\" and pay very close attention to the credentials of the <b> woman </b>who wrote the article - Mallory Millett. Mallory is the sister of Kate, one of the founders and most influencial figures of the 2nd wave for her book <b> \"Sexual</b> Politics\" that became to go to bible for Women's Studies classes that were introduced into academia at the start of the 70's to indoctrinate the students. \n\n3rd wave: Not that it needs any further debunking, but for anyone's whose still on the fence, you could do worse than look up Janice Fiamengo, Christy0Misty, Christina Hoff Sommers, Karen Straughan<b> , R<b> e</b</b>>d P<b> ill Bl</b>ack, Hannah Wallen, Christy0Misty, Studio Brule and a groundbreaking documentary by Cassie Jaye called <b> \"Th<b> e</b</b>> Red Pill\" among others.\n\nOnce you've done that lot, if you're feeling especially brave you could go straight to the bottom of what's a very deep rabbit hole and view an exceptionally well researched video by M<b> ichael</b> Black called \"Psychological Warfare: Cultural Marxism, Feminism & Islamism\"",

There are parts of the feminist movement that I'm not completely for, but as a whole I stand by it.  \n\nTo me being anti feminism is being anti equality. If these women were just indifferent about it that would be one thing, I know plenty of women that don't identify as a feminist (it is mostly due to the stigma on the idea of feminist which I think is sad) but to be actually ANTI feminism to be against the movement that fought and is still fighting for human equality in this world is very bizarre to me.",

You are right in that dictionary definitions are no always what the movement is for, but the main message and purpose behind feminism is equality that is what we are fighting for and I know a lot of feminist and got to a very female driven school so I know this for a fact. You may have an idea of what a feminist because someone had what you saw as negative characteristic traits and labeled themselves a feminist, but that isn't all or even the majority of feminist. I have encountered people who were more on the extreme side of feminism where is was pretty much anti men and I do not agree with that, I think men have different but just as valid struggles as women.

When I heard about the movement, I was shocked by the feminist claims. \"77 cents to a man's dollar!!\" and all that crap.\n\nWhen I joined, I heard that 1 in 6 women at raped. I heard that I will be paid less. I heard that I will be assaulted by all these men and th<b> e patriarch</b>y is accepting it. I heard that I would be catcalled, attacked, and even shamed by men because I was purely<b>  a wom</b>an.\n\nBut I did research and discovered it was bullshit. the defintion of feminism does not speak for the actions of its people. Feminists have manipulated the media into speaking for them, rather than against them, lies, terrified young women like myself and used me to further th<b> eir misan</b>dry. I ask you, if you are really for equality, why are you feminists allowing <b> real miso</b>gyny in places like Saudi Arabia? Why are you not critiquing the Islamic religion and choose to accept sharia law when sharia law harms women? Why are you pushing your opinions and beliefs on young women who are being fed bullshit lies?",

The husband could have paid for everything they have, he could have looked after the kids better and he could have paid for his wife's wants and needs, but In court half and sometimes more of HIS stuff goes to the <b> woman,</b> including kids. The father will then have to pay thousands in child support each year until the kid is 18, and they will have to pay the wife alimony for a long period of time. This one guy had to pay his wife 30% of his salary for 20 YEARS! If you earn 50k a year, without taxes you have to pay your wife 15k a year just because she was your wife, even if she cheated on you and has your house",

Nearly 100% of people believe in that.  But they read the definition of feminism, and then they look at the ACTIONS of feminists today.  BIG difference.  They see that the actions of feminism aren't actions of equality, but are more of man-hating, victimization, rape culture, <b> patriarchy,</b> false propaganda, etc. and they see through the lies.  If feminism was still about equality, like its definition implies, everyone would be a feminist.  But just look at what feminists do and say in 2016 and you'll quickly see a massive disparity between the dictionary definition and what feminists actually do and stand for today.  We'll judge feminism on its actions today, not on the dictionary definition.",

It's not to do with women superiority, just the chance for men and women to be equal in our modern society. People need to realise that our ancestors fought for feminism, women can vote because of feminism, women are free and it's the way things should be. However, there are still places where men are payed more than women, and where men are treated better then women, and it's the feminists who stand up and say that it's not on. We need these people, because without them we can never reach true equality. I'm 15 and I can see this, why can't you?",

Rather than see how the myriad choices, decisions and actions that millions of people take second-by-second push against each other constantly to 'produce' society as we know it, it takes rather crude and arbitrary classifications - white, <b> homosexual,</b> male, female etc. - and insists that all social phenomena can be explained using these.\nThe reasons for injustice and inequality are profoundly complex and to suggest that it comes down to something as simple as one class oppressing another is an absurdity that is as unproven as it is unfalsifiable.\nAnalysing and discussing the premises on which a question is based (e.g. How are group X oppressed by society?) is a staple of critical thinking about an issue - as noted above, the fact that so many course leaders within the social sciences, arts and humanities refuse to accept such questioning in their classes is an absolute travesty.\"  [LINK] ",

During this acknowledged first wave of feminism in the UK, they did  deal with the government of the day to support WWI in return for getting the vote. This led to the very famous white feather campaign in which they insisted men & boys are publicly harrassed & badgered young men & boys into their sordid deaths on the front. These same men and boys, some as young as 14, did not have the right to vote either. Yes, these women of privilege with servants won the vote for property owning women over 30 with the blood of men & boys. I wonder if they will cover that in the suffragette film? Probably not.\n\nThen we had the 2nd wave of feminism & what did those feminist leaders & leading lights give us? Well...\n\nValerie Solanas, founder of SCUM magazine who said \"to call a man an animal is to flatter him; he's a machine, a walking dildo\" or\n\nAndrea Dworkin, \"I want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high heel shoved in his mouth, like an <b> apple </b>in the mouth of a pig\" or\n\nMarilyn French \"Men are rapists and that's all they are\" or\n\nRobin Morgan \"I feel that man hating is an honourable & viable political act\"\n\n& today we have the so called 3rd wave where women are now always viewed as the perpetual victims unable to make their own decisions because of male oppression due to some mythical worldwide patriarchal conspiracy. Such myths as 1 in 5 women will be raped or sexually assaulted by men & the many times debunked wage gap are still rolled out as absolute truths in the same way some dead man rose from the dead 2000 years ago. It is done with the same zeal & fervour & to question the feminist faith brings out the feminist shaming tactics. We can't even have a dicussion without being labelled as misogynists.  Yet these very same feminists like to tell us that they are all about equality, which such wonderful hashtags as killallmen & yesallwomen, but these are not \"true feminists\". Apparently.\n\nWell, you can keep that sort of equality thanks.",

                    "commentText": "+Ellie MacK\u00a0\n\n\n\"But I just want not to be put down because of my <b> gender\"</b> The only reason people use gendered insults for women and not for men is because men don't get offended by them. The point of an insult is to give offense, and so they will insult you based on anything they believe will offend you. Men are insulted according to their<b>  gender</b> as well, however, they do it differently. Men are told they are not manly enough as an insult, called faggots, girly boys, basement dwellers, virgins, so on and so forth. This was also the way in which women were insulted before, being called unladylike however, largely due to Feminism, this is no longer an effective insult and so th<b> e gende</b>r specific insults have devolved into what they are now. \n\n\"to have equal pay\" You have it, and if you don't and can prove it, you have an open and shut lawsuit which is as good as a blank check.\n\n\n\"Equal opportunities\" You have them and more, there are countless special interest programs promoting women into more lucrative fields. However, as a statistical whole, women simply choose to not pursue these opportunities and instead stay happily in the medium of income potential. Look up the number of women entering science courses with the number enteri<b> ng gend</b>er studies... \n\n\n\"I will protect myself f<b> rom sex</b><b> ism\" se</b>xism goes both ways.\n\n\n\"I will still be a feminist for as lo<b> ng as s</b>exism towa<b> rd ANY </b>gender exists\" Feminists are the biggest, most blatant, and most accepted (publicly) perpetra<b> tors of</b> sexism. So much so that they are even trying to say they're not sexist. If you are truly one for equality, you would be an Egalitarian and anti-Feminism. \n\n\nFurt<b> hermore</b>: sexism or any other form of prejudice / hate are ways of thinking. You will never end them and to even attempt to do so would require Orwellian level tyranny complete with \";thought crimes\" You might say \"I want to end the expr<b> ession </b>of sexism\" which is in a way doable, but not by over sensitivity as that actually makes the prob<b> lem wor</b>se. Sexism primarily is expressed as an insult more than a true ideology, and as I stated before, the more offense taken from an insult, the more powerful the insult is and the more pervasive it's use will become. See the N word for another example.",

However if women don't have to live up to men's standards but men still do, THAT is unequal. Especially if the benefits of meeting those standards are just given to women regardless but not allocated in the same way for men. However, democracy has <b> nothing </b>to do with any of that. Democracy has to do with the allocation of government power and law by the masses rather than a select few elites, and has ABSOLUTELY<b>  NOTHING</b> to do the labors necessary to provide for a society without it collapsing without food, water, defense, or even a basic infrastructure. We can't just vote to not do what's necessary for survival and still live. Being a man means doing what has to be done. If women can't live up to that standard, women aren't living up to men's standards. I don't care how much this might offend you delicate sensibilities nor hurt your 'feels', its just reality. \n\nYes, it is true. If you ignore the unequal balances of benefits to responsibilities based aroun<b> d gende</b>r by focusing on a separate topic, you're using a redirect. Further, I doubt women were just lining up to man the trenches given then they passed on the right to vote in order to avoid the draft. Also, raising children and doing basic labor while the men are gone is not the same as going off to get shot, burned, bombed, gased, etc... in war.\n\nAs to the Nazis, I don't see why I shouldn't play that card since it fits. However, you could really insert just about any violent group of militant expansionists in their stead if it would make you feel more comfortable. I do not know to whom you might be referring, but I do know many feminist authors of the time supported Hitler. However, in the end I don't care since whoever it was that you meant, it wouldn't invalidate my point that evil must be stopped by force or it will use force to destroy any other form of opposition, making war a necessary evil in the face of human inhumanity.",

Abortion is a good example. Women get 'my body, my choice' (all the rights) but don't get stuck with 'my financial responsibility' (no responsibilities).

Girls are being oppressed all the time, and so are men. Women and Men are being raped, there is still a pay gap, there is still domestic abuse for both genders, there is still women treated like property so as long as these things are still around there is not equality or ENOUGH equal rights. People like you sicken me, you're too simple to understand basic concepts. Men and women should be equal, that is feminism. It's called feminism because at the time the movement was started, true, women were in a worse place than men and in some areas today they still are. In areas men and worse off. It's not about who is worse off- it's about making sure that we work together for equality, that's feminism. Hopefully you'll get this through you're brain the next time your friend, wife whoever is raped. Or maybe when your male friend suffers from abuse in the home. Hopefully",

Especially since women seem very happy about that whole agreement (see Emmeline Pankhurst on conscription for example). Maybe women and men very treated fairly yet not equal. Men forced into danger through huge obligations to the <b> nation </b>or society and women forced into safety and with freedoms removed. It forms a pretty obvious pattern of population optimization that quite clearly effect both sexes mutually. So focusing on women isn't inherently bad but should not be seen as more important hence it clearly isn't. \n\nCalm those tits and grab some perspective. If they don't want to call themselves feminists because the feminists they meet hate male's and male heterosexuallity, or whatever reason they have, just let them. They obviously share your values but don't believe that feminism is a solution to any of the problems you present. And I love how great of an example you set for the excellency of feminism by proving how emotional and impossible to deal with you can be. Search for the word egalitarianism once and then you'll realise why FEMINISM, not equality, can be done away with.",

Because feminists don't really know today what feminism is.. Radical feminism celebrate the book SCUM and the more nice ones think is about bot<b> h gende</b>r equality when it is not, it is about womens rights and their equality to men, not men's equality to women.\n5. I don't think a complimang about something I show up <b> is sexi</b>sm\n6. I can joke with people\u00a0\n7. I know there is assholes out there and not to blame a wh<b> ole gen</b>der for it\n8. I'm not a expert in history but I know many feminists lie about that women couldn't vote and divorce before they came (Totally bullshit)\n9. I can agree that people should dress how they want, but feminists say that really much, and then they complain how other people are dressed (More like: I like the same rules for all genders on that, not only for women)\n10. I read about things, I know what I am and what I stand for, I read fact's and listen to what other tells me. I think logical and I'm not a feminist, not you either, because you don't fucking know what it stand for!\"\n\n( I just want to say that English isn't my first language, so I know pretty much of my spelling is wrong)",

It promotes the CHOICE to be whatever kind of person you want to be, and does not discriminate against any specific <b> gender </b>or behaviour-unless that behaviour is morally corrupt and wrong- for instance feminists do not hate all men, but they do hate rape;\u00a0feminists acknowledge that someone of any<b>  gender</b> can be the victim or the offender o<b> f sexua</b>l assaults, and it is the perpetrator who is to blame, feminists do\u00a0not negatively\u00a0generalize and do not marginalize men, but are they are aware of the statistical fact that\u00a09 of every 10 rape victims were female in 2003 (RAINN | Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network)\u00a0and that 99% of rape perpetrators are male (US Bureau of Justice Statistics).\u00a0Feminists want to end domestic violence and gendercide in countries like Guatemala and China. Feminists want to stop the outrageous amount <b> of sexu</b>al assault\u00a0people of all genders face while serving in the military.\u00a0Feminism fights against\u00a0damag<b> ing gen</b>der roles like the way the media sexualizes\u00a0and objectifies people and glamourizes violence and\u00a0unhealthy portrayals of men and women.\u00a0Feminists want to stop daily act<b> s of se</b>xism like cat calling, rape j<b> okes, homop</b>hobia, and \"slut-shaming\". Feminists advocate for\u00a0LGBTQ+ awareness.\u00a0Feminism fights or the equal distribution of HUMAN RIGHTS and aims to eliminate the marginalization of minority groups. Feminism works <b> to end patr</b>iarchy. It is the ignorant stereotypes and stigma which surround feminism that gives the movement a bad wrap but none of the negative rumours are true. Feminists\u00a0do NOT hate\u00a0all men.\u00a0Feminists\u00a0DO respect stay-at-home-mothers, and\u00a0fathers. Feminists are NOT all a\u00a0bunch of hairy,\u00a0whiney, lesbians (and\u00a0if you are a hairy, <b> whiney, </b>lesbian,\u00a0that's cool too, because who you are and how you act is YOU'RE choice and no one else's).\u00a0Feminism is a GOOD thing, and really does benefit everyone, of all genders positively. I am proud to call myself a feminist, and if you aren't maybe you should take some time and investigate why exactly you are choosing not to embrace something which will benefit you and society positively in so many ways. It is so important to educate yourself before determining your values.",

They focus on their own and a lot believe that feminism will fix mens issues. That's why I'm anti feminist. I don't agree with anti feminists doing to feminists what they do to us though, calling them idiots. It's a different view and I respect the opinion of any feminist who respects my opinion. Women's rights are becoming a joke in my opinion. Be happy with this equality we have. Both women and men have the same inequalities. Furthermore, most feminists you tell your opinion to will disregard it if it doesn't line up with their agenda and opinion. Urgh, rant over",

Emilline Pankhurst considered Davison to be unstable and tried to maintain their distance from her for the most part. Pankhurst was a hypocrite and a bigot, but she was no fool. \n\nSuffragettes did not suffer any kind of risk of death or injury. Even when they were jailed for crimes of vandalism during their \"smashing glass\" campaigns, they were treated with better conditions than other prisoners. \n\nThe \"cat and mouse act\" was introduced by the British government precisely to insure that no suffragettes died or became ill in prison. Suffragettes also learned early on, that they could get away with most things without consequence, even on occasion assaulting the police. Police in Britain were at first, very reluctant to use their batons on women. \n\nWhen the Police finally did begin to respond to attacks, the reaction amongst British women was mostly disgust at the way the suffragettes had behaved. The suffragettes, they felt, had forced the police to do the previously unthinkable; to use physical violence against women.

What. Good.\n\nAbout the inequality in muslim world. Yes women do not have the same rights, but at the same time, they dont have many of the responsibilities either. A muslim man has to take care of his wife and kids, while womans earnings are purely her to spend. This means men are prefered in education, because their entire future depends on getting a job. I am not advocating for muslims, faaar from it. But it is not as <b> black </b>and white.\n\nMen got the right to vote (only rich/land owners had it before) in EXCHANGE for the privilige of dying in wars. Women did not want to vote AND die in wars, so they politely declined the offer. Then came suffragetes, who protested to ALSO be able to vote, but WITHOUT the possibility of draft.

This mentality that one must hookup and have a girlfriend - as one needs air to breathe - is both antiquated and completely out of touch with the circumstances. Truly sensible women know that they haven't got a hope in hell of finding a \"good man\" especially when they are becoming more scarce by the month and those who do qualify are themselves off the dating market and going MGTOW. So the odds look grim on both ends. Good men are going extinct and men in general are just refusing to associate with women on more and more plains of interaction: dating, working, socializing, etc.",

The slave would work hard in the field and/or house of their owner and in return, the owner provided a home, food, clothes, and entertainment. Money may not have been involved, but all was provided for and community would scorn you for mistreatment or maltreatment of slaves. Of course, as time went on, this got out of hand, especially while slaves were soled to other countries or forced into slavery. That's when abuse occurred. Slaves were maltreated and forced to work for no money or compensation. If a person is willingly a housewife, while it may be a form of original slavery, it is not how it is depicted today. There is no harm as long as there is appreciation and it is an agreement where both are provided for. The root of the original women's issues were lack of appreciation, lack of respect, and inequality. Those are no longer issues. Feminists nowadays are just picking fights for no reason and are putting down their own kind because of choices other women want to make that they (the feminists) think are weak. It's bias and excludes other people's perspectives. Worse, it disregards and puts down men entirely. Modern Feminism is not fair and it's wrong. A housewife, unless forced to be so, is not a weak slave undergoing abuse. Also, how dare you compare a loving and willing housewife to being a slave?",

That doesn't adress the topic, of naming a single law that expresses a single right that men have that women do not. There isn't one. There are, however, many rights that women have that men seem not to...such as the right to choose to become a parent. Of course, that is a topic that no feminist wanting equality is willing to argue should be equal...which I agree it shouldn't....but that doesn't stop them from continuing the delusion they want equal treatment.\n\nThe fact is, women aren't oppressed in first world countries. Individual people CHOOSE to be oppressed in first world countries. If you blame society for your faults, then YOU are CHOOSING to oppress yourself. The fact that some men are dicks to women isn't evidence of the need for feminism, any more than the fact that some women are cunts to men is evidence of the need for \"meninism\", which feminists literally try to censor from public.

For example, the CDC's nationally representative data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual <b> sex,</b> and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were 'made to penetrate' someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced<b>  sexual</b> coercion and unwante<b> d sexua</b>l contact had female perpetrators.\"\n\n [LINK] \n\nThis is why feminism needs to go. It prevents actual victims from getting the help they need by belittling actual victims in order to justify feeding the narcissism of entitled and priveleged girls who want the attention on them.",

                    "commentText": "Maria And Gianni's Channel\n\n\"We do not see things as they are, we see them as we are.\" Anais Nin\n\nConsider the following stories.\nI read an interview of a former professional hockey player, about his experience being the only <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>athlete. He was ashamed of admiting he wa<b> s g<b> a</b</b>>y, because of the attitude and persona in the locker rooms. So, he went through high school, on the NHL draft scout list, dating girls, and partying and drinking every night, even though he didn't really like the lifestyle. It wound up costing him his spot in the draft, as his performance slipped, and he lost the spotlight. Having missed the NHL draft, he signed on to play in European leagues, in Norway. There, he continued the charade of dating women and hiding who he was, always feeling depressed and alone. He said that the constant attitudes, and anti-homosexual remarks in the locker rooms led him to attempt suicide on several occassions. He now is sharing his story, because of how destructive those locker rooms were to him.\n\nHe had a friend who knew he <b> was<b>  </b</b>>gay. His name was Brendan Burke, the son of NHL Hall of Famer, and Toronto Maple Leafs General Manager Brian Burke. Brendan too was a shoe in for the NHL Draft. The Maple Leafs loved him, and he was a welcome guest in their locker room any time. Brendan was a star in the eyes of the league he was destined to play in, and was even the subject featured on TSN discussions routinely. He was a proud ambassador of the sport, and all sports really, inspiring kids all over. They lived radically different lives. \nShortly before Brendan's tragic death in a car accident, he told his friend on the phone, \"I can't wait for the day you can come out and be as accepted by your family as I am with mine\". Yes, that's right. Brendan Burke was expected to be the first o<b> pen<b> l</b</b>>y gay player drafted into the NHL. His campaigns to show tha<b> t b<b> e</b</b>>ing gay didn't mean you couldn't be an athlete, and couldn't be welcomed in the locker room were summed up in his notorious catch phrase \"If you can play, you can play\". Those TSN discussions, were about how this would change the NHL, having it's fir<b> st <b> o</b</b>>penly gay hockey player. Not because people weren't ready...but because people knew there are already likely players who are. As over 70% of the NHL Players Association is from Canada, we will go ahead and use Canadian stats on it. As of 2012, 5.3% openly id<b> ent<b> i</b</b>>fied as gay in a survey. So, 5 out of <b> eve<b> r</b</b>>y 100 are gay. The NHL had 30 teams at that time, all with rosters of 20-23 players. That means there were 600 to 700 players in the NHL at any given time (Double that if you include the entire AHL farm team roster). So, statistically speaking, there should be, roughly 30-35 players in <b> the<b>  </b</b>>NHL who are gay, and another 35 or more in the AHL. Brendan Burke didn't ignite a firestorm of backlash. He didn't live a life of depression and anxiety, or victimhood because of the chauvenistic nature of professional sports. He was openly welcomed by the entire community. The news of his death shook the league. NHL teams lowered their flags, and played in honour of him for what he had accomplished for the league, despi<b> te n</b>ot even being old enough to play in it. The Toronto Maple Leafs started the campagin \"You can Play\", taping their<b>  sticks i</b>n rainbow coloured tape and saying that their lockerroom is, and always will be a welcome place for everyone, <b> regardl</b>ess of their sexual orientation. Other teams and players followed...many. Some from the NBA, even football players, and<b>  ot<b> h</b</b>>er sports. \n\nTwo gay men, one exact same industry and circle (many of the players in European leagues played in or with NHL players/teams too). Two radically different outcomes in life. Why?\n\nHow you are treated comes down entirely to how you expect to be. The first man tried to hide who he was. He lived a phoney life, and as such, people didn't see him as authentic. They didn't trust him. He pissed his future away drinking and partying to try and be \"cool\", when the rest of his teammates were abstaining (many Junior hockey teams here do not let their players drink, have a curfew, etc). He chose his path, as tragic as it was. The other, chose to be himself. He never hid who he was. He didn't worry about whether his father would reject him for being who he is, because he knew that was beyond his control, and had no reflection on him. As a result, he discovered that his father was one of the most staunch supporters he had. Did he face adversity along the way? Of course he did. We all do. But it's how we deal with it that makes all the difference. \n\nOne girl started at the bottom of the pay in a company, as an assistant, complaining she couldn't afford to take care of her children as a single mom, and ended up quitting. Another girl started at that exact same spot, and decided that since she was a single mother, she had to fight as hard as she could to do everything she could to get her kids out of that low income life. Within a few short years, she rose to CEO of that company, starred as a venture capitalist investor on a reality TV show, and is one of the most powerful people in the business world in the country, with hundreds of millions of dollars at her disposal. \n\nIf you feel like you are expected to a<b> ct a cer</b>tain way<b>  as an</b> African American woman, then don't. Be yourself, and to hell with the stereotypes of others. It isn't a reflection of you. Of course there are people that will attempt to hold you back...there are for everyone. Oprah Winfrey faced those e<b> xact sam</b>e proble<b> ms as </b>an African American woman when she started her career<b> ....in a</b> time when neither African American, nor women, were really even considered to be able to be anchors. Yet she defied them all. \n\nOthers can tell you all they want what you are capable of, or what you are allowed to do, or not do....but it doesn't matter, because they don't get to decide. You do.",

That's an obvious difference. \nThen when women have a job and then they get pregnant they get fired because the companies won't pay you unless you are working so basically here in italy if you are a <b> woman </b>you cannot get pregnant or else you will get fired. \nBtw thank you for being respectful towards everyone who has replied to you so far it's nice to have a civil conversation from time to time. \nAnd sorry for my bad english",

In Indonesia, the violence against women tripled between 2010 and 2014; Iraq highly and openly discriminates against women and violence against them is common; In Jordan, women do not have equal economic opportunity or participation; 90 percent of married Egyptian women have undergone FGM and rape culture actually exists there. I could list many more examples, but my point is, those countries need feminism, those countries need women empowerment because on a general and statistical level they're treated awfully. \n\nYou can be for equal rights and not be a feminist, it's called \u2018equal opportunity' - us women can vote, work and are paid equally (the pay gap has been widely debunked and is proven to be due to women's choices, such as statistically taking more time off than men for reasons such as pregnancy, and they're more likely to pick a part time job, not inequality). \n\nFeminism has always meant \u2018women empowerment', so we could have the same rights as men. It was needed in the 1900s, not the 2000s. There are a few idiotic men, but we don't need a whole movement to deal with those few men - we need to defend ourselves as opposed to running for a cover called victimhood. Let's all wake up and realise this movement needs to move to other countries that need it, because we do not need this man-hating bs in our first world countries. \n\nIf you've actually read this, thanks and well done bc this is long af lmao",

No, I didn't.\n\nI am well aware war- especially today has a very negative impact on civilian populations. Two examples are the DRC and Bosnia. But as you are well aware male suffering is trivialised by the media. If there is a <b> terrorist </b>attack in a warzone and 30 people are killed how many times do we hear the expression 'including women' - the insinuation is that male civilians are expendable!\n\nRegarding men forcing other men to fight, that's true. And I acknowledge early feminists- to their credit, often spoke out against that but so did pacifist men. But it is quite obvious that modern third wave feminists don't give a damn about issues that disproportionately impact men. Ever hear the sarcastic feminist attitude smugly looking down on 'male tears' when men do raise these issues?\n\n\u00a0I was challenging the feminist claim that men as a<b>  sex</b> are automatically 'privileged' which is something feminists like you perversely believe and continue to lie about. This is part of third wave feminism's hateful agenda to distort history to present all men as one and the same. Western women are arguably the most privileged people on the planet.\n\nMilitary conscription is one issue, the fact that far more men are homeless is another.\n\nBut then again, as a feminist I don't expect you to be objective.\n\nWhereas I care about HUMAN suffering, as a feminist all you care about is women. This makes you a nauseating hypocrite.",

Most feminists (I know there are the radical man hating feminists but you can't generalise based on a few) do not think that all women's problems are caused by men (unlike way that a lot of MRA's seem to think all their problems are caused by feminism.) When it comes to issues about inequality between men and women I don't necessarily blame anyone I just want to raise people's consciousness on these issues - if i'm blaming anyone it's just the general structure of and general views in society shared by both men and women. When women were fighting for the vote they weren't blaming all men they were just criticising the general attitude of society which both men and women had which was that we were inferior to men and too emotional to be able to vote.",

I've come across too many idiots on here who don't know shit about what they're even advocating and then try to \"damage control\" what their movement has committed by doing what you just did, claim \"Not all Feminists are like that\". Got any more damage control methods you want to showcase? If not, then fuck off you dumbass.",

As men need to prove that are not violent and can be sensible, women need to prove that they can be taken serious in the corporate environment without abdicate from being feminine. To be a leader you don't have to be masculine. You need to reach to people and influence them. So we have a long way to go with this feminism idea.

            "commentText": "This is a one off post. I don't want to get into \u00a0a debate with a bunch of angry young people. \u00a0\na) There are many types of present-day feminism (that have built on the strengths and overcome many of the limitations of the first and second waves of feminism), they may differ in beliefs on how to achieve equality, but they all still share the same goal of equality. I am a man who self-defines as feminist using the same definition as bell hooks.\nb) Not accepting the definition of feminism a person identifies them self by, especially when you also shout at them and demand that they accept your definition of feminism, does little to help in the fight for equality.\nc) When a feminist suggests you read some feminist literature to get a better understanding of feminism, it does not mean that they think you are <b> dumb,</b> just that they think your may not have had access to much education on the subject. Education is not intelligence. There are many structural barriers in today's society preventing intelligent people from having equal access to education which feminists, who share a goal of a wish for equality, are trying to address.\nd) The professions I work in, social work and psychotherapy, have benefited greatly from the peer-reviewed research and overall literature of feminism. In particular, structural/anti-oppressive social work was influenced by feminist writings identifying prejudice ingrained within language and when we looked at the language of risk assessment we saw ingrained prejudice there which contributed to discriminatory practices towards Aboriginal people and by association, the infamous 'Aboriginal 60's Scoop' which traumatized so many Aboriginal families. This helped social workers learn to change the language and format of risk assessment tools and to start using less judgmental language and practices in their daily work which, in turn, \u00a0led to more successful outcomes protecting children and empowering marginalized families. Dr. Laura Brown's feminist research helped identify<b>  gender</b> bias within the language and assessment tools of traditional psychotherapy, which influenced changes in such areas, and we can now see even the DSM5 using less biased language as a result. The influence of feminism has brought about greater success rates in therapy, especially among clients from marginalized groups. There is obviously, much more work to be done in addressing such structural prejudice and I suspect feminist literature will continue to be a guiding force in helping us to do so.",

            "commentText": "I've always hated how femininsts portrayed women and men of the past. Only focussing on the negatives, of women's lives, and never looking at the positives, or even bother to compare their situations with the equally shitty lives of men in those days to get an objective view of life in the past. Let's face it. Life was shit for everyone unless you were one of the few lucky to be born wealthy.\n\nAnd frankly, it's that same one-sided and extremely selective way of looking at things that is what annoys people most about feminism. It's become an ideology that needs to turn \u00e9verything into the next big <b> gender </b>(meaning women's) issue to be able to desperately cling on to the victim role. Thankfuly with a core belief like that of<b>  patriarchy</b> theory (I love how adding 'theory' makes it sound legit) you can keep blaming men for any injustice and ignore everything else. And that's the problem. Feminism sees itself as an infallible authority on justice and equality, but it'<b> s blin</b>d to it's own bias and inna<b> te misand</b>ry. The claim that feminists are about equality in itself is hilarious as soon as you start listening to the m\u00e1ny different interpretations of what equality might be. The main problem being that if you believe<b>  in patriar</b>chy and seem men as innately bad, equality won't mean genuine equality. Equality will mean equality... for women. That's a fundamental flaw, and one that at this point has caused a dangerous imbalance. I'm glad to see people (including myself) are recognizing that.\n\nIt's only after the whole Eliot Roger case that feminists really showed their ugly side and the media bias became hard to ignore. Especially when you start to realize how derailed, and dangerously powerful politicized feminism has become, and how many men's issues are being ignored because of that core feminist ideology that fails to allow men as victims. The only reason feminists are finally starting to make some offensively small allowances towards men, is because they are realizing people are waking up and that if they don't, they'll lose everything. Noone will believe a movement that claims to be about equality yet fails to live up to those bold statements. But it's already too late. Feminism is already on the way out, and good riddance. I'll admit it's done some good,<b>  but not</b>hing that wouldn't have come about by itself in time, and it's done far more harm in the long run. So I'v<b> e got no</b>thing but praise for  #womenagainstfeminism",

It's \u00a0the whole 'man-hating' myth which puts of so many young impressionable kids from seeking out and benefiting from feminist resources which can help them better deal with so much prejudice in the world today. In my opinion, feminism has done more than the 'humanism' movement or any other group that claims to have an interest in fighting for equality. The feminist studies identifying <b> sexism </b>in the language, education and traditional psychotherapy that has led to significant changes in these areas, and in turn improved the quality of life for many marginalized people as a result. I highly recommend anyone wanting a clear understanding of what feminism (as the fight for equality) is, to read some Bell Hooks. Cheers.",

I call this feminism, and I believe the term had been very clouded by radicals and people spreading hate.",

I agree in a way, however I would add \"of value\".   They have added plenty to our society, for example, Feminism has facilitated the destruction of the family.\n\nSome ways they have done this, tell young ladies they can have it all, career, wife, mother.  This has caused many young ladies to focus on their careers through their 20s, then ask where all the good man have good in their 30s.  Single mothers have become idolized, while fathers have no control whatsoever over reproductive rights (other than abstinence of course) and are labeled dead beat dads.   Granted, some certainly are, on the other hand some had their children stolen from them by corrupt family courts, empowered and encouraged by feminism.\n\nNo fault divorce, pushed for by feminists, means that many men that have not cheated on, or abused their wives, can be divorced for literally trivial \"offenses\".  Over 70% of divorces are filed by women. With few exceptions, fathers are relegated to seeing their children every other weekend, but are still responsible to support them.  \n\nPushing false narratives such as the wage gap, rape culture, manspreading, mansplaining, etc. have driven a wedge between the sexes based on blatant lies.\n\nIf I am understanding your point correctly, I must disagree, feminism is cancer.",

No. Everyone had shitty little lives, aside from that small minority of wealthy individuals at the top of the ladder, that consisted of both men and women. All the rest was lucky enough to have a meal at the end of the day. It's easy to judge from your comfy little 21st century life. And people look at the right to vote like it was really such a big deal. Humans didn't have the right to vote for the majority of their existence, man or <b> woman.</b> Eventually men got the right to vote after dying by the millions in nasty trench warfare. Women weren't \"fighting\" for their rights to go to the battlefield, were they? Ofcourse not, because it was hell. What consisted of \"fighting for the vote\" was basically a bunch of women standing around with picket signs annoying people untill men just gave it to them, because that's what men do.
