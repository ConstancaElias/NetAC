        "postText": "A transgender teenager who took his own life was getting hormones from unregulated online doctors.', 'Jayden Lowe, 18, died after being told he would have to wait years for gender reassignment treatment on the NHS.', 'He was paying \u00a330 a month to receive testosterone in the post, an inquest into his death heard.', 'However, his mum Claire Lowe, 49, has now called for a second inquest after realising the teen received treatment from GenderGP, which operated without a licence between March 2017 and February 2018.', 'The firm is run by Mike and Helen Webberley, who have both since been suspended by the British Medical Council pending investigation.', 'Mrs Webberley was fined \u00a312,000 in December 2018 after she was found guilty of illegally providing healthcare services from her home.', 'The transgender specialist treated children as young as 12.', 'Claire told CambridgeshireLive: \u2018You would have expected this to come out at the inquest. We don\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t.', '\u2018As far as we were concerned, he was 100 per cent that \u201cthis is the answer to my problems\u201d. We had no idea they weren\u2019t registered.\u2019', 'His dad Neil, 55, signed off the treatment because Jayden was about to turn 18 and they \u2018knew he would go in for it anyway\u2019.', 'Mr and Mrs Webberley are now reported to be moving to Spain to carry on the business.', 'Jayden had already been on the child and adolescent waiting list for 11 months when his GP told him he would be referred to the adult list because he was turning 18.', 'This meant he would have been left waiting for an additional two years.', 'He told his mum at the time: \u2018I can\u2019t live like this.\u2019', 'Jayden had been taking the treatment for \u2018a few months\u2019 when he died after being hit by a train on September 22, 2018.', 'A coroner was satisfied Jayden took his own life and recorded a suicide verdict at an inquest in March.', 'Coroner Rosamund Rhodes-Kemp said delays in Jayden\u2019s treatment were a \u2018significant factor\u2019, but added: \u2018The precise details of what was going through his mind will never be known.\u2019', 'In a statement on GenderGP\u2019s website, Mr and Mrs Webberley said: \u2018There are no words to describe the devastation when a life is lost, let alone how much deeper that pain must be felt in cases where the person struggled for years to access the care they needed, and was refused.', '\u2018Whatever the circumstances, our hearts go out to Jayden Lowe\u2019s family who, it is clear, did all they could to help him.\u2019', 'It added: \u2018When Jayden approached GenderGP he explained: \u201cI have been on the NHS child and adolescent waiting list for over 11 months now only to find out they won\u2019t even see me because I\u2019m going to be 18 in a few months so I am currently being referred to the adult services but the waiting list is up to two years. I currently feel extremely unhappy and impatient. I have waited long enough\u201d.', '\u2018Dr Mike Webberley, a consultant of 35 years\u2019 experience with the NHS, assessed Jayden, together with GenderGP\u2019s multidisciplinary team of nurses, psychologists and therapists.', '\u2018They determined that prescribing testosterone to achieve masculinisation was the correct course of action. There is robust evidence that access to timely treatment can greatly relieve mental distress, particularly in younger gender variant patients who are acutely socially aware of their gender misalignment.\u2019', 'Jayden was 13 years old when he came out to his parents in a text.', 'A spokeswoman from the General Medical Council told CambridgeshireLive: \u2018Dr Helen Webberley and Dr Michael Webberley are both interim suspended while the GMC investigates. The interim suspensions were imposed following separate Interim Orders Tribunals at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service.\u2019",

GenderGP provided a lifeline for trans people who have 4 year waiting lists for a first appointment on the NHS who are in dire need of help. They've since moved to Spain as the medical council have prohibited them from working in the UK as they were ruled not fit to practice. The NHS is not fit for purpose and one of the few private services has been forced abroad. Until the situation changes, this will keep happening.",
