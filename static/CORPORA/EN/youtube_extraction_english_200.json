            "commentText": "I'm am currently dealing with this.  I work as a freelancer/contract basis and have more than double the experience as most in my business but have a really hard time getting work now.  I'm only 48.  But to them, I'm an <b> old </b>man.  The people doing the hiring are young and they only hire the young.  My work and resume speak just don't seem to matter anymore.  So now I'm trying to find work outside my industry, just a normal job, to help pay the bills. But even then, I get laughed at a lot.  They're like what are you doing here?  They don't take me seriously.  It's SO frustrating!!!",
