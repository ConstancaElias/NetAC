THAT is what i oppose and that is why I refuse to be labelled as antisemitic. I have <b> nothing </b>against Jewish people or their religion. And because I am an Atheist, I do not believe in any religion. I see all religions as ways for governments to force regimes onto lands of people for control through blackmail and fear of persecution. So, take away religion in Israel and you're left with a Banking Gangster Cartrl who stole a country to use as a military base in order to force commercial, economical and governmental control into other local countries, especially for their oil and other minerals.",

I came to watch this because I have noticed that throughout the \"anti-semitic Labour Party \" alegations two of the most direct victims of the attacks are two old-guard traditional socialist leaning politicians with incredibly positive records regarding combatting<b>  racism</b>. My earlist political memories are associated with the Anti-Nazi movement and the free festivals arranged by Ken Livingston, in the late 1970's with the \"Rock agains<b> t Racis</b>m\" events. And Jeremy Corbyn, who has protested throughout his adult life in many anti-racist events.\nNeither of these individuals have made statements that involved any attacks, but their words were intentionally taken out of context. I am almost bemused by the fact that no-one at all in the mainstream media addresses the question of \"political zionism\", and apart from george galloway in a very biased episode of QT, I have not seen an episode of Questiontime where an audience member has asked a question about the \"Zionism\" issue. Continually I watch the media use the entirely weaponised \"anti-semitic\" but never in mainstream media do we hear the word \"Zionist\" or \"political zionist\", these are not fictional beings, and these expressions are not used as insults to describe these people. \n\nI also researched a little history on the initial beginnings of the accusations and very quickly found the generally identified starting point of the accusations. \n\nIn fact, the initial accusations begun under Ed Milliband's leadership, and seemed to result from Milliband's statement that he, if made the next prime-minister believed in a two state solution, this is not something that the political zionists agree with, and through their network of pressure groups and action groups began the momentum of accusations. \n\nI also did this with Ken Livingston, and found that his the trigger was a quote in the JC stating that Livingston had said \"most jews are tories...\", What livingston had actually said was \"during the 1980's under Thatcher many Jewish people did very well, and they started to vote Tory\". \n\nI would really appreciate seeing a question on QT which asks the panel about Zionism and Anti-Semitism, there is a  very important distinction and it needs to be explained and seperated instead of avoided. Anyone who spends any time studying it can see that the political zionist unit has far too much global power and is using language to hide behind",

They only converted to Judaism to escape persecution. They spoke Yiddish- which is not Hebrew- but is phonetic Khazarian that is made to sound like Hebrew, so they can claim ancient tie to Semite Jew! They started Zionism- a military movement- in the late 19th century. This movement- headed by Rothschild Jews- force England to grant them Palestine officially in 1948 via the Balfour Declaration. Ever since then, these Zionist cunts have embarked on the mission of <b> ethnic </b>cleansing (a crime against humanity) against Palestinians- the true Semites (or should I say, Canaanites) of Palestine- a place where Jesus was born. Jesus was not Caucasian. Being a Palestinian, he would have olive skin, brown eyes and dark<b>  black</b> hair. \nJudaism is a dead religion:\nJews lost their kinship. Th<b> e Ol</b>d Testament says; king David's line would stop once the Prophet Jesus Christ arrives on earth and he did, but the hatful Jews killed him.\nJews lost their priesthood once the second temple was Destroyed in 70 AD and with it the genealogy. Therefore, no Jew can prove he is from the trouble of Levi. And with no Priesthood; there cannot be a temple. \nJews have no prophet; there has been no Jewish prophet after Jesus Christ. \nTherefore, These fake politically driven Jews are mere thieve<b> s, nothi</b>ng more.",

Anyone I know who is against israeli policies who isn't an anti-semtie doesn't use or in many cases know the term anti-zionist. They just state they don't agree with this or that. To use the phase anti-zionism u need to be in the know somewhat. Also if u use the phrase anti-zionist on any jew outside of israel that is also anit-semtism. Since a jew in London, or Panama, or anywhere in the world has <b> nothing </b>to do with israel. It's like blaming a catholic on Boston for something the vatican says or does.",

Mr. Sacks example of some criticizing the British government vs. others saying Britain shouldn't exist clearly shows he has a nuanced view of the situation and a good interviewer would have asked questions like \"What do you think of those who support the existence of Israel as a Jewish ethnostate but also support the right of Palestinians to have their own ethnostate and not be forced out of Gaza where their ancestors have lived for at least a 1,000 years?\"\n\nOr another good question: \"Do you support the State of Israel's policies to ensure that <b> ethnic </b>Jews are the dominant majority? If so, would you also support the British people (i.e. English, Welsh, Scots, & Irish) if they were to implement policies that ensure their ethnicities remain the dominant  majority in Britain?\"",

It is to be noted that in most of these confrontations only one side has any real evidence. The critic might point to evidence of <b> ethnic </b>cleansing, property destruction and land theft, and various policies that have, according to David Harel, the vice-president of the Israel Academy of Science and Humanities, turned Israel into an 'apartheid' state. On the other side, however, those using the straw man fallacy often have no objective evidence at all. Their claim of anti-Semitism is based on their own idiosyncratic definition of this prejudice. Making a case in this way also involves 'begging the question' or 'circular reasoning,' which are also erroneous ways of arguing. This occurs when a person 'assumes as evidence for their argument the very conclusion they are attempting to prove.",

            "commentText": "The comparison between the right to criticise the British government and Britain's right to exist is faulty at least and does not stand. Britain has existed as an independent state in its own territory for thousands of years without interruption. The territories they conquered through colonialism and imperialism they don't own anymore, and those are more similar to the story of the establishment of the modern state of Israel, if you will, as people living in the area for centuries were deprived of self-determination. I understand Rome acted very bad in expelling them from the land in AD 70, but that means for almost 2,000 years there was no political Jewish presence in the land to claim or fight for independence while living and suffering in their motherland. My country Albania gained independence from the ottoman empire after 500 years of an occupation that was not only brutal but almost destroyed our identity through forced assimilation and conversion into ilsam. However, Albanians lived in the land all the time, always constituting at least 90% of the population. So, you can see, we held the right to claim independence after all those years and to remove occupants from the land we always owned and always had the right to claim rule over. In Israel's case, you celebrate independence against whom exactly, the people who, after Rome brutally dislocated you, lived there for generations? The state of Israel now being a fact, I do not oppose its existence, but as to it being right... I am not sure. Remember, religious Jews never agreed with Herzl's vision of a Jewish state without the arrival of the Messiah. And no, anti-zionism is not, in principle, the same as antisemitism. Being critical of the way a state came to be is not the same as hating each and everyone who is Jewish.",

To equate anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism is to call many many secular Jews (and Israelis) anti-Semitic - and most of the enlightened world as well. No true humanist or secularist can support the present <b> nation </b>State of Israel because it is not a democracy - Zionism ensures it never will be - and it engages in apartheid. The same holds for most, if not all, of the Arab states - there's no democracy and the entire Middle East is flooded with<b>  nothing</b> but warring misogynistic theocracies. And no one with half a brain supports a Christian America or any Christia<b> n natio</b>n state. Further, no one that accepts the scientific method and natural selection can truly support any state founded on religion/mythology. By \"Lord Load of Gefilte Fish's\" definition millions, perhaps billions, are anti-Semitic.  Even the most obnoxious zealot anti-Israel loudmouths mean the State of Israel shouldn't exist - in its present form. But no wonder. As long as corporate media continues to give religious leaders a seat at the table - these myopic folk who make stuff up to further their own religious agenda<b>  - nothi</b>ng will ever change. That goes for Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, and Wiccans as well. Lastly, it's too bad to see religious leader's willful but ignorant erudition on display when they cannot distinguish social stereotyping and tribalism and implicit bias - f<b> rom rac</b>ism and anti-Semitism. Clearly \"Lord Gefilte Fish\" never took a psych 101 class. A little less emphasis on being the chosen little Gefilte fish in an anti-Semetic pond - and a little more emphasis on being a primate - then let's here what 'Lord Gefilte Fish' has to say.",

How long can you shout and claim \"Anti Semitic!\" Before people stop listening? They only gave you that curtesy of listening because they were only hopping you could be reasoned with. But anti Zionism is now anti semetic? Oh dear. This one is wearing <b> thin.</b> \nSo Jews were hated for their religion? And what was practiced in this religion that has had them kicked out of over 100 countries in the past that we know of?\nLike I said the tide is turning. \nIs calling you the \"Tares\" Anti-semitism? \n\nMatthew 13:24-30 \n24\u00a0Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 25\u00a0but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 26\u00a0But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth<b>  fruit</b>, then appeared the tares also. 27\u00a0So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 28\u00a0He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 29\u00a0But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 30\u00a0Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.\n\nThey look physically like us but that \"White Devil\" the world hates are the very ones who run the media, banks, all corners of entertainment industry and government. Then they claim to be victims?  They hate whites, they masquerade as whites except when they want to claim or get recognition. Then it's \"I'm not white. I'm Jewish.\" And that is what they are brought up to believe and do believe.\nThese Tares (as Jesus told us) are the same ones who are infesting white Europe and only white Europe under the guise of multiculturalism.\nJesus was not a Jew. He was an Israelite. Jacobs name was changed to Israel. Israel is not a place, it's a memory, it's who you are. Hence \"The lost tribes of Israel\" \nWhere is Jacobs pillow? \"The Throne of David\"?\nWhy is it that their Israel has never matched up to the bible but it matches up to Britain perfectly?\nHow can anyone honestly believe that that middle eastern robbery is the work of God. Why is it these Jews do not have the throne?\n\nIt was emperor Constantine who established the Jerusalem in the Middle East 200 years after Hadrian had torn down th<b> e ol</b>d and disassociated it with Edinburgh. Constantine established it for political reasons that are still being practiced today. there is a plethora of sites in Edinburgh that still carry its past. There have even been gold and silver coins with King Solomon been found in the city and as far as Cornwall England. Do you know that Edinburgh has a \"Jacobs ladder\"? Names have a way of sticking even \"The Jacobites\" were no mere conscience. How can people claim to be of God when most of them know the lies and diciest Israel was established on. This is not the work of God.\nThe bible makes it quite clear that Israel is a covenant, a promise, a memory, it's Jacob. Not a place. And when that memory gets blotted out of the history books (for the most part) they control. People forget who they are and that's why they are called the lost tribes of Israel.\nHosea 4:6 \n6\u00a0My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.\n\nRobert the Bruce of Scotland was the last king to sit on the throne of David. Before it was taken into hiding in Scotland when Edward Longshanks invaded Scotland. It still remains hidden in Scotland today. Edward Longshanks (King Edward I of England) claimed to have stolen it when he invaded scotland, he did not. All Edward Longshanks did was create a counterfeit throne (much like the Jews counterfeit \"Israel\") and paid a few traitor lords of Scotland in land and gold if they would pay homage to him as King. And acknowledge his counterfeit throne as the real throne of David. Th<b> at h</b>ag that claims to be sitting on the throne knows it's counterfeit. She and all her kin are illegitimate. \nUnderstanding the oath that is given to God by those who can sit on the throne of Israel. Is to understand that the monarchy now ruling the uk are illegitimate and not gods chosen to rule Gods people. Brits were all celts so to speak before Rome invaded. Jacobs pillow (the Thorne of David) was carried for hundreds of years by the  people's of ancient Britain after the fall of Judea. The throne of David was transplanted in Ireland. Then it was taken to Scotland where the Kings of Scotland were crowned. The reason for the term \"God save the King!\" Is because only a king who is of the blood line of David and of God can sit on that throne and rightfully rule over gods people (The tribes of Israel/ the Israelites).  \nEzekiel 21:27\nI will overturn, (Judea)\noverturn, (Ireland) \noverturn, it: (Scotland) \nand it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him. \n(\"Him\" being the King of kings, Jesus Christ)\n\nWhere is the these Jews answer to Ezekiel?\n\nGenesis 12:2\nAnd I will make of thee a gr<b> eat nat</b>ion, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: (Great Britain) !\n\nThese are both from<b>  the</b> Old Testament. They may be oldies but they are goodies, and these Tares fufill none of them.\n\nHere is a new one. \nRevelation 2:9 \nI know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.\nThe BBC are the PR firm of these Tares and all other MSM outlets.\n\nBeannachd Dia Dhuit.",

Zionist expansionism/imperialism - is another matter entirely... and the Rabbi, in failing even to admit there is such a thing as a 'Greater Israel Project', is using a typically Jewish kind of verbal 'sleight of hand' with this straw-man and hoping no-one will notice.\n\nIf Israel were to cease her continual genocidal behavior against her neighbors, stop her <b> ethnic </b>cleansing of Arab countries, and and pull back out of all occupied territory, to the borders established for her by the international community in 1967, perhaps the anti-Zionist movement would dwindle considerably... (and if she were to hand over her Zionist banksters to international legal authorities for their international monetary scams, the 'Federal Reserve' banks, it could possibly disappear altogether!)\n\nInstead, however, all we see is Israel (and her Zionist banksters) behaving abominably, and in true Jewish style, scapegoating her victims/neighbors. \n\nIf Jews do not like 'anti-Semitism', perhaps they might ask themselves, where does it come from? How could anyone possibly NOT love 'God's Chosen People'? Or what said 'Chosen Ones' have planned for the 'Goyim'...? What's not to love, already...?",

The wako from wako (David Koresh) was a devote Christian speaks for all of Christianity. Maybe Jim Jones speaks for Christianity. Why don't you read more sites on Zionism and Judaism. True and real Zionist is just the believe that Jews deserve there own homeland.  <b> Nothing </b>else. \n\nJews don't own all the  money and banks. Just use<b>  common</b> sense. Do you think any of the 600 billion promised to Iran would of gone to them if so. Just think so much goes to enemies of Israel. Just think. \n\nYou can go to any Jewish bookstore and buy a Talmud. Non Jews are not forbidden to go. You can find translations on line. Go and try. As for your quotes this is what your sources do. Lets say that the Talmud says in Tractate X page y.   \n\n\"Rabbi X says that the world thinks it's permissible to lie, cheat, steal and even kill non Jews with no punishment. I'm here to tell you it's wrong and here is the proof. \"\n\nYour sources will do this. \n\nHere is a quote from Rabbi X in Tractate X page y \n\nit's permissible to lie, cheat, steal and even kill non Jews with no punishment. See how evil the Talmud is. \n\n If you bother to read before and after the quote you'll see how they lie and manipulate the verses to produce anti Semitism. Challenge me on anyone of your quotes and I'll show you. \n\nWould you like the religious reason or the non religious reason why Jews were kicked out of all countries? Or both?\n\nMy Site is the actual Arab leaders telling you this. It's not lie. It gives you all sources what TV shows, what papers so you can yourself go to the archives of those stations or papers and see for yourself. Just like me this site doesn't ask you to take my (or its) word for it. Check it out yourself\n\nI am more than willing to get into a Gaza discussion with you but let us try to separate. I don't want post to get to long. But believe me I have what to say and prove to you who the rea<b> l terroris</b>t are. Who is the liars are. Look at there media and ours. That alone should tell you something. Israel is not perfect but it's much more human than they are. \nThey lie to you much more.  You are justifying the wrong way. Israel defends itself from suicide bombers. They don't force them. \n\nAs for the chosen ones. You misunderstand that too. It doesn't me G-d love big over small, white ov<b> er bla</b>ck and so on. What it means is simple. G-d was first looking for someone to choose him. No one di<b> d.  Noth</b>ing but idolatry.That was until Abraham came along. He past on his teaching to Issac and Jacob. It was then that G-d made a covenant. Since you chose me (to the fathers) i will choose you and your descendants as my people. \n\nOur post are getting long. Please keep them short. One subject at a time. But do me a favor. Please read the Israel side of things. \n\nHave a good day",

                    "commentText": "As I've said, it's not so much what Israel 'says' that makes me believe that Zionism is a <b> racist,</b><b>  imperialist</b> doctrine, but what Israel actually DOES in Gaza and the WB... I watched her actions for a long time before I became an anti-Zionist and it is her actions that I judged her on, not just her ideology... and it seems like ISrael is quite full of 'wakos'... (Btw, it's spelled 'Waco'...)\n\nAnd believe it or not, I was brought up as a Christian, and was taught that Israel was the 'Holy Land' and that the Jews were 'God's Chosen People' as per the bible (Torah), along with Christians, of course, as believers in the same sky-fairy. I did not become an atheist, nor an anti-Zionist until much later in life... (only during the last few years) until after I'd learned that 'God's Chosen People' were not all 'nice guys', or 'the good guys' as per the myth.\n\nWhat you call 'True Zionism' is really the complete inversion of Judaism... and it belies current and on-going Israeli expansionism. And here's a curious question for you: How is it that prior to WWII the Ashkenazim were in a minority of 'World Jewry', but today they comprise 90% of it... How did this come about?\n\nListen up: The ownership of the banks by ISrael's banksters does mean that they quite literally own virtually all the money in the world, which is only LOANED to the rest of us; no money at all comes into existence without being BORROWED into existence... and who owns it? Those who print it, who create it (out o<b> f thi</b>n air!) and loan it out to we 'Goyim' at interest. This is 'usury'... surely you've heard that word before? And it is the source of all inflation, which exists as a secret form of taxation imposed, willy-nilly, upon the rest of the world.\n\nAnd I've NEVER judged ALL Jews, nor even all Israelis, as if they were ALL Zionists; I'm aware that many of them aren't... but you are using the 'No True Scotsman' myth for Israel and saying 'No True Zionist' would do anything devious or underhanded... Do I really need to explain why this is a fallacy? In any case it is usually a mistake to believe one's own propaganda... (as you are doing, I might add).\n\nIf what you say about 'True Zionists' 'just wanting a homeland' were true, then how do you account for Israeli expansionism/imperialism? Why is ISrael not content to stay behind the more than generous allocation of borders which was given to it by the international community in '67? And why does Israel continue to attack her neighbors (when she's not getting them to attack each other using false flag operations... The Gulf of Tonkin, the Lavon Affair, the attack on the USS Liberty and 9/11 were all Israeli false flags used to drag her golem, the USA, into wars from which ONLY ISrael and her banksters benefit). Of course, you will deny the veracity of these facts too... but they ARE true.\n\nI don't know which '600 billion' you're talking about but if Israel is 'giving' this money to anyone, it is a LOAN which will be repaid with interest, like all loans from the banksters. Debt is their weapon... so any 'loan' is no act of friendship or kindness; quite the contrary.\n\nAnd yes, I'm aware that there ARE actual 'rabbis' who, like your 'rabbi X' in your example, contradict other rabbis who say it is permissible to rob, rape and murder non-Jews... but this does not change the facts that, a) such rabbis DO exist and DO believe those things in the first place, and b) that such rabbis are actually in the majority now, and your 'kind' rabbi, who objects to such an evil double standard is very much in the minority... \n\nLike Norman Finkelstein, perhaps... Now there is a believable Jew... an admirable fellow.\n\nI've already given you quotes, and challenged you to give me a context which could make any of them sound less evil, but you just say are not in the Talmud and so do not even attempt to place them 'in context'. I don't know any Jewish bookshops but I'd be happy to read a Talmud if I can get hold of one... Is there no online version I could read? Rumor online has it non-Jews are forbidden, on pain of death, from reading it. \n\nAnd what about the Zohar? From what I've heard it's even worse than I've said the Talmud is supposed to be... (and then, of course, there's the Kabbalah, but that's quite another story, isn't it? But much used by your banksters, for a start... you DO know that 'Freemasonry' is a Jewish invention? This is a fine example of the use of mystery cults as tools of imperialism, about which I've already spoken briefly).\n\nI'd actually like to know the REAL reason they were kicked out of so many countries... truly, 'anti-Semitism' really just doesn't explain this at all... but some of those cabbalistic and imperialistic practices I've mentioned just might.\n\nNow you personally may not think Zionism is about imperialism or expansionism, but this doesn't make it so, does it? Did you google the 'Oded Yinon Plan' for 'Eretz Yishrael' yet? You see, in spite of your denial, such imperialism not only exists, it is central to Israeli policy, so your denial comes across as just another lie... You already have a 'homeland'... why bother that the borders are not quite what your fairy-tale character says they 'should' be? Why the expansionism? \"Today Eretz Yishrael... tomorrow the WORLD!\" perhaps? (Sound familiar?).\n\nTell me also, why is it that Jews have a 'right' to a homeland (which was someone else's before they took it!) but Palestinians don't? The same reason, no doubt, that Jews have the 'right' to 'self-defense' but Palestinians don't...\n\nYou still don't get it, do you? Israel's treatment of Palestine and Palestinians is what creates suicide bombers... or do you think you can treat people worse than you'd treat any animal and it would have no effect on them? That you can steal people's land and homes and NOT have them fight to get it back? This does not make sense. Or do you think that, as \"God's Chosen People\" you Jews can do no wrong? That any evil you do is 'God's evil' and thus 'good'? (as per the Talmud's 'Law of Inversion'? Or do you deny that this law even exists?)\n\nI suppose you don't remember how the Zionists thanked the British for their help in obtaining Palestine for the Jews' 'homeland'... by bombing the then British headquarters in the King David Hotel in Jerusalem... After such treachery, who can fail to believe in Jewish duplicity?\n\nI really don't care how you attempt to justify the 'Chosen Ones' phenomenon... I really don't care how they say they were 'chosen'... (So a Jewish fairy-tale says Jews are their own god's 'Chosen Ones'... Big deal! Why should ANY non-Jew even take such a notion seriously?) As I've said before, there are NO 'Chosen Ones'... only self-chosen R-souls.\n\nAnd how come the majority of Ashkenazim are actually atheists, but this still doesn't stop them from using these fairy-tales as the basis of their claim to the land that Israel currently occupies, as well as the rest of 'Eretz Yishrael' as it is described in Jewish fairy-tales? Seems a little 'odd' don't you think? Not to mention 'hypocritical'...\n\nI'm sorry our posts are getting long... but it is necessary for me to address each point you make and I like to do so as completely as I can.\n\nOh, one point I've missed... you say there are Arab 'leaders' who now 'toe the Jewish line' and say that Arabs are the 'real terrorists'. So what? What about all those Jewish soldiers, ex-members of the (ironically-named) IDF, who have told the truth about what they were expected to do in Gaza and the West Bank? I think you know as well as I do that it is not so difficult to brainwash people into saying just what you want them to say, so such examples (of 'Arab leaders') are questionable at best... Though in the case of the IDF soldiers, who gave their testimony willingly and without any form of brainwashing,  prompted by their consciences alone, these ARE believable.\n\nHave a nice day.",

You are <b> blind </b>as a bat to the truth. \n\nJews do not own the banks period. Jews own some but plenty are owned and operated by non Jews or a board of directors that aren't Jewish. \n\nZionism and Judaism aren't the same but a vast majority of Jews support  Zionism. Zionism is<b>  nothing</b> like you think it is. Anti Zionist are that for one of two reasons. They had bad experiences with some so they take it out on all. That or you were befriended by an anti semit/ and or  Zionist who talked to you and conceived you of the lie you believe. Which one for you?\n\nTell me if Zionism is so much about expansion then why has Israel  been willing and actually gave away so much land for peach? Amazing all they want to do is expand expand but all they seem to do is give ups land. Remember the Gaza, Golan Heights. They offered 5 times to give up almost all that the Palestinians want but  were rejected each time. And each time we give up land it's used against Israel. The Gaza is used to launch rockets and for tunnels. One gives up for peace one rejects peace and users there new land for war. Look at the history the actions alone should tell you Israel is not about expansion. \n\nYou seem to want to mention the supposed bombing of Israel but forgot the non stop bombings of the Arabs in Israel and all over the world. Why concentrate on Israel and ignore the rest of the bombings. Anyway we can go one by one with your anti Israel bombings if you wat. \n\nThe majority of the world is not Ashkenazim. The're plenty of sfardim. In my area t he majority of Jews are not Ashkenazim.  Most Jews aren't atheist they believe in G-d but just don't feel they have to be religious. o\n\nThe Chosen people idea is in the bible read it. \n\nThe IDF is not perfect but believe me they are a zillion times better and more moral than the Arabs. What other country would throw it's own out of a land to give it to there enemies who swear to kill them. What other army warns there  enemies to move because an area will be bombed.?  \n What other country stops planned bombings to save lives. You say all they want to do is kill look into the news the go out of there way to protect there enemies civilians.  Read what is really going on. \n\nI live in Israel I talk to many people in the Army or who was in the Army all you believe is  BS. \n\nHave a good day.",

I do not believe the Israeli narrative with regard to Gaza and the West Bank either.\n\nI never said \"Jews\" own ALL the banks... but Zionists most certainly DO. You DO realize that the majority of Zionists are actually Christians? (And some Muslims, too... believe it or not!) And, as the current saying has it, \"all wars are bankers' wars!\"\n\nFunny how the 'vast majority' of Jews are now Ashkenazi, too, isn't it? You never did answer my question about how this came about since they were in a minority before WWII...\n\nWhat land has Israel given away? That it was not FORCED to by the International Community...? Do you deny that the settlements and the encroachment of the 'security' wall (Ie. the 'land grab' wall...) continue to go on, in direct contravention of International Law? And in total provocation of the Palestinians... who you claim have no right to defend themselves from this on-going real-estate theft, even if they had the means to do so, which they DON'T.\n\nDo you deny that ISIS were supported by Israeli air-strikes during ISIS' invasion of Syria? Or the desire of Israel to get its golems, the USA and NATO to go to war YET AGAIN on ISISrael's behalf against both Syria and then Iran so ISISrael can install a pro-Zionist puppet government? Sorry mate, but your denials are fooling no-one.\n\nIf someone invaded your property, and killed off many of your family members, then after a lengthy battle a stalemate was reached, in which you were given permission to live in the attic and basement, while the invaders occupied the rest of the property, how long would it take you before you would stop fighting to get back ALL your property? Or would you be content to live in the attic and basement, like a rat?\n\nYou seem to think I don't criticize Islamic terrorism but I do... on sites where it is relevant; this site it is Israeli terrorism which is relevant. And even if it was relevant here, Islamic terrorism does NOT excuse Israeli terrorism (or Israeli 'false flags' or 'perpetual war for perpetual profit'; the motto of the Zionist banksters!), though I realize you apparently think otherwise.\n\nSo... now you are equivocating about most Ashkenazis being atheists... I suppose you really have to do this, don't you, so you can go on maintaining the claim that your sky-fairy 'gave' you that land... \"A land without people for a people without land\" was how it was originally sold to the rest of the world (and, I'm quite sure, still how it is taught in Israeli schools), rather than the truth that 800,000 people were either slaughtered or evicted from their homes in order to make way for your 'Jewish homeland'...\n\nSo... you DO believe in the 'Chosen Ones' concept, then? I don't... I'm an adult and far too<b>  old</b> to believe in fairy-tales! There are NO 'Chosen Ones'; ONLY self-chosen R-souls who think they're above everyone else. Such arrogance usually comes a cropper in the end.\n\n\"What other country would throw it's own out of a land to give it to there enemies who swear to kill them.\" \n\nWell now... it's funny you should mention this; now I have a chance to tell you how the Ashkenazim got to be such a vast majority of world Jewry... but I won't go into great detail here; suffice it to say that in the diary of Theodore Hertzl, prior to the start of WWII, it says, \"The suffering of the Jews must be made to increase\"... and \"The anti-Semites will be our best friends; the anti-Semitic countries, our allies...\" You see, they had a problem: How did the Zionists get Jews who had been living in Europe quite comfortably for centuries, to 'up stakes' and start all over again in the middle of a middle-eastern desert? Not only was WWII the Jews' idea... so was the Holocaust; what better way to get them to move?\n\nIsn't it true that it was mostly the Sephardim who were 'exterminated' in the concentration camps? And now the Ashkenazim are the 'majority'? You deny this, but I've seen statistics which said that the Ashkenazim represented 90% of the Jews in New York, and more like 95% of the Jews in Israel, which are the two largest Jewish communities in the world.\n\nI understand too, that Germany was one of few countries that would accept Jews after they were kicked out of Russia... but this didn't stop 'Judea' (ie. the Jews in diaspora) from declaring war on Germany in 1936, did it? They introduced sanctions which led to the deaths of millions of Germans... and this was also the REAL beginning of WWII.\n\nAnd don't forget Israel's 'Thank You' to the British for all their help in getting a homeland for the 'Jews' only three years after the war ended... \n\nNot real strong on 'gratitude' the 'Jews', eh?\n\nBut you think you're a 'Chosen One' and as such, you can do no wrong, so I realize there's little point arguing with you any further. Your position is more religious (and propagandist) than rational, therefore you prefer mythology to history and doing whatever you like to anyone you like, to having to behave like a civilized human being towards everyone, even those you dislike, and negotiate with them in good faith, as equals.\n\nI'm not surprised. But I thought you 'Jews' were supposed to be smarter than that.\n\nHave a nice day...",

Israel doesn't encourage there citizens to blow themselves up.  Israel readily agrees to peace talks and offered so much so many times for peace. It's the Arabs that rejected every offer of Israel. It's Israel that does  what it can to protect enemy civilians not the Arabs.  Arab media says over and over kill kill kill. You'll never find this on Israel media. Far more Arabs are killed by Arabs in far more cruel ways then Israel ever killed but somehow you think Israel is the bad ones.  ARabs live far better with far ore rights in Israel than they do in Arab lands.  You believe lies. So with this let us just call it even. You won't change my mind and I won't change yours. Let the readers decide for themselves. \n\nZionist don't own banks. So much money goes to so many things against Zionist interest. Why are you so <b> blind </b>not to see this?\n\nI answered you.  A vast majority of Jews today are not Ashkenazim. There are many Sfard and Sfardi ones. \n\nThe  Bible is clear this land is the Jews read it.  You say that Palestinians were evicted from there homes. Yet you forget that in Gaza Jews were evicted. Palestinians have plenty of places to go. Many live in Israel. All Arabs can live in Israel. You also forget that there was a Jewish presence here long before there was a Palestinian one. I see you ignored my 12 questions to you. There never was a Palestine before Israel came along. That was invented after Israel became a state.\n\nIsrael had to give up the land BS. Israel freely offered the land. More than 5 times. When Ehud Barak was prime minister he freely offered 95% of what they wanted and each time every offer it's the Arabs that rejected the offer. Not  Israel. This people that want to expand offer to give up there land over and over. Offer not forced offer. \n\nNo country for any reason does what it can to protect it's enemies citizens the reasons you gave are made up.  Amazing anything pro Israel you have a logical reason why it's BS but with anything anti Israel so true. \n\nThe Jews are the chosen ones. Read the bible. Just read it. It's clear the land was given to us. It's clear that G-d chose us. If you don't believe in the bible how can I argue with you on this. \n\nJews started WW2 that is funny. I see you clearly read anti Zionist sites and believe any BS they give you. Germany tried to kill all Jews. Yet Jews started this. I suppose you believe crap like Jews did 911, there was no holocaust and that the Arabs are really peace loving people.  \n\n I agree there is no point in arguing with you. Your a<b>  blind</b> fool. \n\nI suggest to all readers look up Prague University. They support all I say with facts. How Israel is the most moral army.  How Israel always offers land for peace and so on. \n\nWe are done here. I can't deal with someone s<b> o blin</b>d to the real truth. That hates Israel for no reason and refuses to see both sides. Anything pro Israel is jus propaganda BS but anti Israel is absolute truth. You'll say this even if the sources where from the same paper and source. If you dare read and see the Zionist sites what they have to say. You clearly only read one side. \n\nGood bye. You go on being right. Till then we are done. \n\nAny reader can contact me separately to ask any questions.",

There are beheading in public. There are public executions on a regular basis all over the Arab world.  None of this you find in Israel. None. Yet somehow you insists it's the Israelis that are the cruel brutal killers and don't want peace.  Tell me again if you are so sure that Zionist or Israelis are so cruel then please go in the middle of the Palestinian control areas.  Yell I love Israel. say anything against the goverment there. Dress like a religious Jew and see it will take around 10 seconds for you to be tortured and kill. This is no joke.  You can dress and live like a religious Arab in Israel. You can vote and receive all the rights in Israel as an Arab that any Jew can.  But again somehow it's Israel that is the brutal people. Just don't get you. \n\nWith your peace talks. Israel not only agrees they make real offers. They gave away land. Each and every time this peace offer of Israel was meet with war from the Arabs.  Each and every time it was Israel that makes the offer and the Arabs that refuse. But again somehow Israel is the one that doesn't want peace. \n\nJews were in this land long before Arabs.

You dont' believe in the bible so it's useless to mention it. \n\nYou claim that Israel makes the Palestinians live in barbaric conditions. Why don't you bother to find out what is going on. Israel allows tons and tons of aid into the area. They allow so much food and cement to rebuild houses. What did the Hamas authority do? They kept the food for themselves and took the cement to build tunnels to get into Israel and do <b> terrorist </b>attacks. All the medical supplies, and medicines and ambulances in the territories are from Israel. So many Palestians go to Israeli hospitals to be treated. I believe it was the Hamas leader (or one leader) that requested he be treated in America or Israel. Don't give me this BS that Israel makes things unlivable for the Palestians. It's there own that does. They deny there own the very basics.  You should see areas in the territories. They certainly aren't lacking. \n\nThis is what you are saying \n\nIsrael wants to expand expand. Reality. Israel has to give up give up (and does) and the Palestinians want want want and get. \n\nIsrael are the evil<b>  terrorist</b>. Reality They send there own to kill themselves by killing Israelis. Arab are responsible for almost ever<b> y terroris</b>t attacks in the world. Yet Israel are the ones that are t<b> he terrori</b>st. \n\nIsrael is evil and teaches there own to be evil.  Reality. there media is full of kill kill kill. You're a maryter who gets 72 virgins if you kill Israelis and Jews. You get streets named after you if you kill. You never find this on Israel media. This is never taught to Israel. Yet again Israel is <b> the terror</b>ist. \n\nYou say the PLO are forced to act so barbaric since Israel treats them so bad. Reality is the opposite. Israel was forced to build the wall because of<b>  the terro</b>rist attacks. Those attacks dropped dramatically since that wall was build. But it's wrong for Israel to build there own. All the security measures are wrong even though they protect Israelis. \n\nOne of my favorite that I only noticed on Shabbat. Israel only gives land because the UN says so. Or the world must listen to the UN. Yet it was the UN that gave Israel to the Jews. Not all of it. The Palestinians got more land than Israel. Israel was willing to live in  peace. The Arabs attacked  So in short. If the UN does something that makes Israel looks good well Israel does it because they have to. Opposite if it makes the Arab look bad O ignore the stupid UN. \n\nYou Israel is so bad that they don't care about there enemies citizens. Reality Israel does everything to make sure they have a chance to leave before an attack. The response of Hamas is to force there own to stay in the line of fire. They take there own into the battle fiels. There wives children and babies. They put there weapons in hospitals, schools and residential areas. But somehow  Israel is the evil ones. \n\nMy above should answer your questions.  Israel in reality treats the Palestinians good. makes sure they are taken care of Nazis did the opposite to Jews. It's there leaders that make life miserably for the Palestinian. \n\nNow you come back and back and I have to answer you. If  you want to stop then stop but do me a favor. Research the Zionist side. \n\nIf you want to stop stop. If you answer just like you I feel I have to answer. So it's your choice stop or continue. I prefer you stop.

Palestinians or Israel?\n\nAll the above should make it clear that it's the Palestinians that keep the violence going not Israel. It should be clear that human life <b> means no</b>thing to them but means a lot to Israel. \n\nIf you are so sure that Israel is the monster here then take me up on my challenge.  You conveniently never mention that. Will you go deep in there territory dressed as a Jew? I'm more than willing to do the opposite in Israel.\n\nAs for your claim Jews kill so many Palestinians. Again if there authority would just let there citizens listen to the warnings.  Leave dangerous areas. If there authority would not use there own citizens as shields then around 90-95% of the Palestinian deaths would not occur. \n\nJews do not think non Jews are subhuman., I proved it to you and you just ignore that.  \n\nYou have no clue of the idea of chosen ones. It's not that we think we are so much greater so we can mistreat others. I explained it to you but in one ear and out the other. \n\nI\"m no liar and I am not paid to do this. Israel doesn't need to pay anyone. There are plenty of Israel supporters that freely and willing post     pro Israel stuff like me. \n\nNow I will say goodbye. Just like you if you bash Israel I feel I have to respond. If you think you can be the better man then don't reply.  Don't  tell me I\"m wrong for replying and should say good bye when you reply and do the same.  Just like so many anti Israel people. Israel is wrong for doing x but when non Jews or non Israelis do the same it's ok they are forced to.\n\nCan we agree to disagree? Just say yes. Your pro Israel and always will be and I'm anti Israel and always will be. I'll say good bye and that will be that.  \n\nCan you be a big man? Can you do this?\n\nHave a good day.",

I just don't believe it. Its self-serving Zionist propaganda which does <b> nothing </b>but demonize Arabs whilst lionizing Jews... and about as far from 'truth' as such ideologically-originated positions usually are.\n\nI never once denied that the Palestinians hate the Jews... or that they were brutal. I merely gave you a better explanation for their hatred than mere 'anti-Semitism' (as YOU define that word... it's meaningless to me!) as well as their brutality... (which Zionist Jews have driven them to, of course).  \n\nSo of course I'll refuse your 'challenge'... which amounts to<b>  nothing</b> but a challenge to suicide. \n\nBut you STILL seem to think it's okay for Jews (no doubt because they are 'God's Chosen People') to steal land from people and deny those same people any right to either defend themselves or to protest against the theft... but hey, they're NOT 'chosen ones' are they? So whatever they feel doesn't count, does it? It's not like they're actually HUMAN or anything is it...  \n\nOkay, so I was wrong about there being no online Talmud... on this issue I'll stand corrected... and, as it was a far more reasonable challenge (though still a tall order, mind you!) I shall read it and get back to you when I find the quotes I have previously mentioned... or other quotes of similarl<b> y racis</b>t content. It may take me some time, however, but I'm sure you won't mind waiting, will you?\n\nBut I notice you still haven't addressed the Oded Yinon Plan for Greater Israel (\"Eretz Yishrael\"). I suppose, as you have provided me with a link to the Babylonian Talmud (I hope it is in English, or there will be little point in your referring it to me...) perhaps I should return the favor by providing you with links to explanations of the Oded Yinon Plan for Eretz Yishrael... Here you are:\n\n [LINK] \n\n [LINK] \n\n [LINK] \n\nI suppose three links should be sufficient to establish its existence... which is absolute proof that much of what you've said is just Zionist bullshit, simply because there IS such a plan, and this in and of itself PROVES Israel's imperialistic, expansionist nature and goals.\n\nOkay, I won't say 'goodbye' because I still have to come back to you with the quotes from the Talmud, if and when I find them.\n\nJust in case you think I'm totally making them up, however, I'll also give you the sources I have them from... This video clearly shows them in The 'Treatise Sanhedrin' of the Babylonian Talmud:\n\n [LINK] \n\nYou may not hear from me for a while (for which I'm sure you'll be as grateful as the Jews were to the British for 'giving' them Palestine...) but I will be back, after I've read the Talmud, so I won't say 'goodbye'... just 'au revoir'...\n\nPS: Oh, btw, exactly what is your position on these quotes? That they exist and are disputed? Or that they don't exist at all? I merely ask because I'd like to know exactly what it is I'm trying to refute... You know all I asked for in the first instance was an explanation of what context could possibly make these quotes any less evil than they obviously are... (assuming, for the moment, that they do exist... though tbf, the links I've given you should be plenty of proof that they DO come from the Babylonian Talmud... perhaps you might like to save me the trouble of reading the whole thing and accept that, yes, they do at least exist... and maybe confine any rebuttal to trying to make them sound less 'evil'...)\n\nThen maybe our discussion might move to more fruitful areas... such as philosophy, perhaps...",

Yet even the most Israeli-nationalistic of Zionists still call themselves Jews.\n\nBit odd that, isn't it? \n\nSo how do I know if you are really a 'Torah-observant' (ie. 'true') Jew if you disobey the commandment of God that you should not have any <b> nation </b>of your own until the messiah comes? (And if you're not a true Jew, but call yourself one, how can I - or anyone else - trust you?)\n\nOr will you say that the messiah has already been and gone? Are you secretly accepting Sabbattai Tsvi as your messiah? Or perhaps it was his 'reincarnation', Jacob Frank? (The author of the Zohar, I understand...)\n\nOkay...

                    "commentText": "I AM in the process of reading that site you linked me to... but it IS a very big site and will take some time... also it is not the easiest of sites to read as it is full of either Yiddish or Hebrew terms I've never met before, so I may need to ask a question or two every now and then. I'm not being deliberately obtuse; I have agreed to read that site (and the Talmud), and I'll do so in good faith, but this is obviously going to take some time.\n\nYou know that I don't think of 'all ISrael' as being 'cruel'... just the Zionists... although you can't deny that they are in the majority. (What percentage of Israel would you say are Zionists?)\n\nYou were talking about 'True Zionism' and saying that 'True Zionism' was neither expansionist nor <b> racist,</b> nor cruel... I send you a link to a video which disproves this from the mouths of Israeli prime ministers throughout Israel's history which totally proves that your statement is untrue, in their own words. You have yet to comment on that video. \n\nBut my latest question is taken straight from your linked site and I think it's a fair enough question... According to the definition of what constitutes a true Jew in your (Babylonian) Talmud, Zionists cannot truly consider themselves 'Jews' because Jews MUST observe the Torah and obey God... these two things are essential to being a Jew, even according to the Talmud... and God commanded that Jews should never have a state until after the return of their messiah. So how can any Zionist truly consider himself a Jew? It seems to me that either you are a \"True Jew\" or you are a Zionist, but it is impossible to be both simultaneously, even according to your Talmud...\n\nI must point out too, that there are some Jews (or 'ex'-Jews, such as<b>  Shlomo</b> Sand, and perhaps Norman Finkelstein, for example) who might agree with my reasoning... \n\nNow, for me to stop would be to give up on your challenge... which would be an easy thing for me to do... but then neither of us would learn anything, would we? However, I shall try to keep my posts short and down to one point at a time... \n\nYou may notice that my last couple of posts were both brief and had only one question each in them, though I have reiterated them both here as I would like them both answered because they are both directly relevant to claims you have made yourself.\n\nBtw, I'm very glad that you consider your 'messiah' has not come yet... but you can't deny the Sabbattaean element of (modern, so-called 'reformed') Judaism... or Zionism. My question with regard to what you call 'True Zionism' (but by which I think you really mean 'True Judaism') is an attempt to discover to what extent 'True Judaism' has been 'infected' and subverted by Sabbattaeanism and Frankism... ie. to what extent is 'reformed' Judaism STILL 'True' Judaism? Or, put another way, to what extent is Zionism REALLY Judaism? Does it not rather stand traditional, Torah-observing Judaism on its head? That's how it seems to me, anyway...",

You can't just read the whole Talmud and just expect ot understand it. That is like saying you can read the whole Encyclopedia and understand everything in it. \n\nSabbattaen is a small group and it doesn't speak for mainstream Judaism. No more than any one branch of Christianity speaks for all of Christianity. \n\nZionism and Judaism are not the same. You don't have to be religious to be a Zionist nor do you have to be Jewish that should be obvious.  But a vast majority of religious Jews are Zionist. This should tell you something.  \n\nYou tell me there are some Rabbis that agree with you that Zionist is evil. Unfortunately you are correct. But I can show you a huge list of Arab leaders that are pro Zionist. Your response to that is my response to you. \n\nBeing observant does not mean to observe perfectly. And again I told you there is no law that Jews can not have there own homeland even when it's not under Torah law. That is a minority opinion. I gave you the answer to that and I see you ignored it. This is what I\"m seeing with you. I respond to your points but they are ignored or you just repeat your points as if I never responded forcing me to repeat mine.  Do you remember my answer to this?\n\nYou say there are Jews like Norman that agree with you. Funny how you ignore the tons of Jews that don't. You seem to want me to say his opinion is much more important that all the Jews in Israel that love Israel.  I can give you an Arab that to me has much more weight than  Norman. She is not Jewish and grew up in Lebanon. She's very pro Israel. She'll tell you over and over that Israel is a great country and the radical  Muslims that run Palestine and many other countries are the real monsters. Her name is Brigitte Gabriel.  Take a look at here stuff. But I bet you'll find a reason why your Norman is real and speaks for all of Israel and Brigitte shouldn't be taken serious. \n\n [LINK] \n\nMy challenge to you (about going into the territories) was to only show you who the real monsters are. You are totally safe looking and acting like an Arab in Israel but you put your life in danger just looking like a Jew there.  I see you just making excuses for there brutality. Even if you feel they have an excuse it still gives them no reason to teach 3 year <b> old </b>kids to kill. To have three year<b>  old</b> girl on public TV give a demonstration on how to kill Jews. It gives them no reason to have kindergarten graduations put on plays were they pretend to kill soldiers and take over Israel.  If they truly wanted peace they should only teach the adults to kill and say I wish we didn't have to but we must. This they don't say but Israel does. \n\nNow again only one question or point at a time. Please. Ask me directly then I'll answer. I think I addressed all your points. I just you see you ignoring many of them and act as if I never said it.  But to be honest the kindness thing you can do is to just stop. I really with my heart and soul prefer this. It's a true waist of time for both of us. Readers can decide fore themselves and contact me or you for questions. \n\nHave a good day.",

Please make up your mind.\n\nI'll be back later to answer this latest post after I've considered what it says in a bit more depth. I think I have answered all your points but I'll check to see if I have 'ignored' any (I may have ignored repetitions of points I've felt I've already answered); you just don't like my answers or my refusal to simply accept all your Zionist assertions, and your Zionist interpretation of history, at face value, when it is so easy to demonstrate Zionist duplicity, eg. the motto of the Mossad: \"By deception thou shalt make war!\" Which, I understand is taken from the Talmud. Or the attack on the King David Hotel in '48... or the attack on the USS Liberty.\n\nI'm glad you don't want me to read the whole Talmud; but I think it necessary for me to at least read the relevant section, the Sanhedrin Treatise, from which the quotes were supposedly taken.\n\nFor the time being let me just say that either you haven't sufficiently understood my point about Zionism being the inversion, or even the direct opposite of traditional Judaism (or are you saying you've accepted the Sabbattaean 'Law of Inversion' as being valid, perhaps? Btw, this is not an insignificant point for ALL \"Jews\"... and the rest of the world, too!) or else you are being deliberately obtuse; even according to the definition of what it means to be a Jew in the Talmud, Zionism is diametrically opposed to God's own, personal command to (and plan for) the Jews that they should have no homeland; it was part and parcel of being a Jew... The 'Wandering Jew' was the archetype... Until the messiah comes. And you say he hasn't 'been and gone' (which statement I accept).\n\n(Btw, I'm not just saying this to suggest that I want Israel to disappear... I have no objection to Israel, and personally have no belief in 'prophecy' as such; but I hope you will understand that I, and the international community, DO have a legitimate objection to 'Eretz Yishrael'... and that has been the entire focus of my discussion so far).\n\nI'll start responding to your latest post, one point at a time, with the problem of 'Jewish religion as it pertains to Jewish identity'.\n\nYour suggestion, whilst sounding reasonable at first glance, that 'an imperfect Jew is still a Jew', whilst referring to Zionism and a desire for a homeland which derives ultimately from the Sabbattaean 'Law of Inversion', is a bit like saying that 'even a Satanist is still a Christian' (and, please note that at least I DO recognize that Sabbataeanism is the Jewish equivalent of Satanism).\n\nAnd, like the Satanists, with whom I'm sure they are allied, I'm aware that these Sabbattaeans (and Frankists, from which group modern Zionism originated) actually represent a small minority, but, through their use of Cabbalism (ie. secret societies and/or occult, 'magical' practices), and enormous wealth, largely through their infiltration and occupation of positions of power and authority the world over, have wielded an inordinate influence on global affairs... and not just in the establishment of a Jewish 'homeland'.\n\nAs I understand it, this isn't so very far from the Orthodox position on the subject of Sabbattaenism, too...",

That alone should tell you something.  His points of view are not accepted as valid in Orthodox today. His form of Judaism is not an acknowledged form of Judaism in the Jewish world. Just like Messianic Judaism. Zionism didn't start with them either. Get real\n\nI think Israel has every right to exist.  I don't think there is any legitimate reason for Israel not to exist. If you want to say there is then every country has been brutal past. Look at America and how it was to the Indians. Maybe America should be given over to the Indians for Americans were brutal to Indians. Britain has a history. The church has a history of violence. Not one country or religion can you not find reasons for it not to exist.  But as always Israel is the one that gets all the attention.  I say a vast majority of the claims against Israel are lies and I am willing to prove one by one. \n\nI understood your points but just like you I see you being advasive of my points to you. The following mail seems to ignore so many of them.\n\nBeing a Jew and acting like one are two different things. By Jewish law your a Jew if your mom is or you convert properly.  But that doesn't mean your acting like one. Messianic Jews act like Christians not Jews. Jews that ignore Torah and the commandments aren't acting like Jews.  It would be the same as an American. If he has citizenship he's an American. If he lies on his taxes, joins a <b> communist </b>party or anti American stuff then he's not acting like an American.  \n\nBut again do me a favor just call it quits. Such a waste of time. That again would be the kindest thing you can do for me.",

I'd say that'd be a pity after we've both put so much energy into this discussion so far... I'll still go on to read the Sanhedrin Treatise, and the other website you linked me too, but won't get back to you, if that's what you want.\n\nHave you no comment, at least, on the video of quotes about Israel and Zionism (re Zionist expansionism and aggression) that I've given you a link to? It is direct and positive proof that your 'True Zionism' is a mythical beast, at best! (And a total deception at worst...)\n\nOh... btw, I've no objection in principle to her existence; I'm NOT one of those calling for Israel to disappear... nor do I 'believe in' the prophecy that she will... but I would say that if Israel continues to behave as she does, with 'Chosen Ones' impunity to the laws and sentiments of the international community, I'd say it's a logical certainty that she WILL.\n\nPS: I've never had any trouble understanding anything I've ever read in any encyclopaedia so far... ;) Have a nice day.",

I gave you the answers I guess I have to again. \n\n1. There never was a Palestinian land before or a Palestinian people. I gave you those 12 questions to prove it.  Just look at who is called the Palestinian people all the time.  People of Lebanon, People in the Gaza. People all over the world. \n\n2. Jews were there fare longer and long before Islam was even heard of     it's really the land of the Jews. \n\n3. They were given the land in 1948 and they could of had it and kept it for Israel had no interest in war. But they went to war and lost it. Is it not the UN rule that what a country wins in war they get to keep? I think you fail to realize that the UN is one of the most anti semetic organization there is. They pick on Israel far more than any other country even when the accusations against Israel exist far more in other countries. \n\n4. Jordan is what was the Palestinian land.  They have plenty of places to go. That is were  they live. Tell me were do the Jews have to go? Why don't they deserve a land of there own? Why is it that this tiny ant of a <b> nation </b>has to give up land when the Arabs own the rest of the middle east? Take a look at a map. Always Israel that has to give up. None of the  Arab nations have to do anything. \n\n4. Every time they are given weapons (and believe it or not Israel has given them weapons in the past) or land they turn around and use it to kill Israeli and Jews and you honestly can't understand why Israel wont let them have an army? Tell me why won't the US allow Iran to have nuclear weapons? Same reasoning here.  But I guess it's right not to give Iran Nuclear weapons but wrong for Israel not to let the Palestinians have weapons. \n\n5. Read the charter of Hamas it's clearly says they only want the destruction of Israel<b>  nothing</b> else. This is why they reject every peace deal even the one were they could of had 95% of what that asked for. \n\nI can go on but I think you got the idea. \n\nHave a nice life and may you only find blessings and happiness. \n\nSo have a nice life.",

                    "commentText": "(Sighs gently...) I can see you're not learning anything... You see, this response is really unsatisfactory and only demands further comment and/or questions:\n\n1: It does not matter that neither a <b> nation </b>nor a state of Palestine existed prior to '48; the region has been called Palestine since Roman times, and it is hardly surprising that its occupants, both Jewish and Arabic (as the Jews were never really 'expelled' from Palestine by the Romans either), identified themselves as Palestinians; it was called Palestine even under the Ottomans and British... Besides, if you're saying that a people without a state have no right to establish one (even in the region in which they have lived for centuries) then you're also saying that the Jews, prior to '48, had no right to establish one either. Remember it was the RIGHT to a state I asked about... not the 'reality' - or otherwise - of one... And as I've already said, whether or not there was an actual state or<b>  nation</b> of Palestine prior to '48, the 800,000 people who lived there and who were either killed or forcibly evicted during the Nakbah actually owned the land; they had LEGITIMATE title to it and were evicted under force of arms. Illegally. \n\n2: Now I think you finally reveal your real objection; it is not to the presence of Arabs as such, which Israel objects to but Arabs as Muslims... it is the presence of their religion in what you regard to as YOUR 'holy land'. (Does the phrase 'religious intolerance' mean anything to you?) Ironic that their fairy-tale and yours are so similar, especially in their belief in their own status as 'Chosen Ones', and the fact that the region is THEIR 'holy land too'... and, even more ironically, their fairy-tale is based on YOUR Jewish fairy-tale, too. If you would only think for a few moments about what I've said about religions being the tools of, not imperialists, but the (money-)power behind the imperialists, you might realize that it is, and always has been, through religion that imperialists control the people... and the Jews been controlling both Muslims and Christians for centuries, through those ancient Jewish fairy-tales. There is some hope for the world, perhaps, in the fact that most of the Ashkenazim are atheists... if only they can eventually learn to let go of their 'self-chosen' 'Chosen One' status!\n\n3: Now this is just a lie... they were NOT 'given land' in '48 at all, but rather had the large majority of their land taken away from them; only a Jew could squint enough to see it any other way. IF Israel had 'no interest in war' where did this 'Nakbah' (Catastrophe) come from? Who was it that killed or evicted all those 800,000 Palestinians? (Which fact also well explains why there are so many people all around the world who now identify as Palestinians). They did NOT 'went to war and lost it'; they were invaded, tried unsuccessfully to defend themselves from their invaders, who then promptly grabbed as much of their land as they possibly could... in direct contravention of International Law. Oh, look... there's that word again: \"anti-Semitic\"... wonder what it means? So far as I can tell it's just a kind of tic; a nervous response to any kind of criticism of anything remotely to do with Israel, Judaism or Zionism.\n\n4: Jordan was not part of the territory agreed to by the UN as 'Palestine' under the 1949 Armistice Lines; and instead became the kingdom of Jordan (or rather, TransJordan)... But in any case we're talking about those Palestinians who were living in what is more commonly recognized as 'Palestine', the borders of which, strangely enough, prior to '48 were identical to those Israel currently claims... (to the extent that Israel recognizes ANY borders at all...) Besides which, to transfer Palestinians away from their home land to Jordan would involve their mass deportation and this would be against International Law. (Not, I realize, that Israel gives two hoots about that... 'Goyim' Law, eh...?)\n\n4 (b): You should have given them freedom and maybe even their land back; or at least the right of return, so they could live as Israelis in the new Israel... (as per the 'one-state solution', perhaps?) then they would have had cause to thank you, rather than hurt you... but if you rob them, force them to live in intolerable and uncivilized conditions, and then YOU give them weapons, who is to blame for your stupidity?\n\nIf you wish to discuss nuclear weapons, I could point out that Israel is already a nuclear armed rogue<b> , terroris</b<b> >t nati</b>on, with at least 300 illegal nukes and an existing plan, very eloquently entitled, the 'Samson Option' in case she should fail to get her way through more conventional means. (Need I say more?) Need I say that the threat of force is also illegal under International Law?\n\nTbh, from where I sit, were it not for your Samson Option, it might actually give me a strange sense of relief, if anything, if Iran were to get nuclear weapons, because then at least there might be some possibility of a 'balance of power'... and if this means Israel and Iran get locked into some kind of 'cold war', a<b> rms r</b>ace stalemate, then so be it! \n\nApart from anything else, however, it must also be pointed out that, unlike Israel, who has not stopped attacking her neighbors (when she's not getting them to attack each other...) ever since her inception, Iran has not actually attacked ANY O<b> THER NA</b>TION in several hundred years. \n\nISISrael was born in blood and can only continue to exist in blood... apparently!\n\nHamas is an extre<b> mist, terr</b>orist organisation who bullies the Palestinian people into doing whatever it wants... left alone, the Palestinian people might even be persuaded to accept a one-state solution. But Hamas is also Israel's creation, and it was infiltrated by the Mossad very early in the piece and has in all probability been largely controlled by them ever since. Besides... judging all Palestinian people, or what they want, by the Hamas charter would be like judging all Israelis and what they want by the standards and actions of the Stern Gang, or the Ergun... Oh, dear! Unfortunate choice of words... I forgot how many of your previous prime monsters have been members of those part<b> icular ter</b>rorist organizations. Anyway, I seem to remember that Hamas have also 'come on board' for what is referred to as the Palestinian 'Peace Offensive' (though one can only imagine why ISISrael finds peace so offensive...) \n\nI could go on, but I think you get the idea... Sorry, but I couldn't let your lies and half-truths pass without comment. It's just not in me.\n\n'Bye now... have a nice life.",

Zionists aren't semites. \n\nSharing features with their fellow <b> ethnic </b>Europeans of a sharp nose and fair skin, they ought to return to their European homeland. Genuine Arab and Jewish semites of the region who share features of a soft nose and olive/tan skin, deserve to remain in the region. \n\nAs for the comparison against Britains right to exist vs Israels, this is a flawed comparison for the simple reason that Israelis lay false claim to that land. They falsely claimed they were semites and that their forefathers lived here. That may have been true for SOME of them, but the vast majority of Israeli Zionists are not true semites. They are Europeans who used the European White Guilt  as a way to usurp Palestinian (Muslim, Christian or Jewish) land! \n\nIt's not just about Israels policy or bad decisions. It's about their fundamental claim to that land which is an ABSOLUTE LIE.",

Anti-Zionism is 100% rooted in Antisemitic values. People who try to obscure the truth are just racists who are afraid to accept that label. Why don't they just admit what they are, instead of trying to glorify it and make it into some righteous cause to openly hate all Jews who support Israel (most Jews). It's because they are cowards. An anti-Zionist Jew is like a<b>  black</b> person who i<b> s racis</b>t towards blacks, or a Non-Jewish white person who wishes he w<b> as bla</b>ck, and hates all white people.

You realize, don't you, that in its more intellectual formulations, Taoism is an atheistic philosophy? \n\nIt's mystical strain notwithstanding... I think I know where that came from now: The very first 'Chinese' - actually 'proto-Chinese' - imperial dynasty, the Shang, who were originally migrants to the area, when 'Taoism' was already ancient, and who worshiped a volcano god called Yahwe... \n\nI'm currently considering the hypothesis that ever since they left (or perhaps, were evicted from...?) the Chaldees, the tribe known as the Magi and their descendants, using their monopoly on knowledge (they were the first to compile an encyclopedia and establish bureaucracy) became a caste (still very much 'tribal' even today!) of ancient priestly-bureaucrats who have been 'farming' empires (eg, Babylon, Persia, Media, Assyria, Lydia, Rome, Sparta, Athens, Macedonia, etc); by investing in them, (and their wars!) and reaping huge profits as they both rise and, inevitably, fall... (quite probably assisted in both trajectories by a sacrosanct 'free market' over which they, the money-lenders/makers/usurers have total control... not much has changed).\n\nThey still do so by cultivating mystery cults/religions in which the putative emperor is the 'Son of Heaven' or the 'Son of God'... and his people are, therefore, 'God's Chosen Ones'... \n\nBut, and this is the 'crux of the biscuit': the Imperial Way is NOT the Way! The Imperial Tao is NOT the Tao! :)\n\nTime to do away with all these ancient, sado-masochistic, ('Jewish') fairy-tales... and once more, it is time to cultivate what Confucius referred to as 'Ren' - 'Human-heartedness' - Humanity, instead of throwing it away in an inevitably futile attempt at becoming little 'god-lings'... Time to cultivate the Tao of Humanity; the only appropriate Tao for Humanity! :D",

Billion of dollars have been poured into Gaza and the West Bank to no effect.  Where has the money gone?  Most of land used for Jewish <b> immigrant </b>settlements was fairly purchased.  Granted there has been unfair confiscation of some Palestinian settlements.  Every time Israel made 'land for peace' deals with the Palestinians, it ended badly for Israel.  Palestinians and Arabs living in Israel enjoy unpresidented freedoms, even election to the Knesset. Name me one Middle East country that has a Israeli cabinet member!  In fact, where are the Jewish populations of those countries?  Where are the Christian and other religious populations?  Palestine is a convienient excuse to criticise Israel by the other Arab nations.  Why don't they open their doors to Palestinian refugees? Why don't they cerate a Palestinian<b>  nation</b> somewhere else that is safe for them?",

Thousands were even following Jesus even Israelites, as they did not like the Selfish Talmudist Judaism. Thus, around 100 ad, Rabbi Shaoul a Jewish high priest started \"reforming\" it all, creating the \"Judeo-Christianity\". mixing Judaism with Christianity. Similar grouping created the Evil ISlam.

Then the armies of FIVE surrounding countries all attacked the new state of Israel with the intention of destroying Israel and killing all the Jews.

The Jewish people have a right to our homeland that we have occupied continously for over 3000 years. Disagree with the ISRAELI government if you want- deny our right to exist as a <b> nation </b>and you are an anti semitism whether you like it or not! !",

And israel gave ample warning to leave the areas of war and dropped leaflets etc but hamas prevented them and murdered many directly. Hamas wanted the civilians to stay put to protect their rockets from getting destroyed because they knew israel tries its best to avoid civilians.

Why don't they do this!?   Because these Pharisees are fake...th<b> ey us</b>e 'race' as a shield but a Jew<b>  isn'</b>t a race at all<b> .  Only</b> a racist would<b>  make</b> it a race.  Try not to be gullible. Think circumcision and why God had them do it.  If you are a child of God based on the flesh, then MAN IS GOD from Adam onwards.  Seem like a bunch of self Idolatry pretending to worship God but jus<b> t a for</b>m of racist colonialism repacked and blaming God to sucker the ignorant",

The point here is that there is at least some semblance of power sharing, such as the Kurds holding 18 seats of Iran's 290 seat parliament (as of the 2013 figures).

My mother's family were sent to Spain.  Arabs and the like moved in and settled.  It was ruled by a number of conquerors:  Ishmaelites, Christians, Mongels, Turks ...  It was a type of no-mans land and considered a country. It was renamed Palestine by the Europeans for the lack of a better name. Gaza and the West Bank are ruled by the Palestinian Authority.  If Gaza is a shithole, blame them not Israel.  It is politically convenient for the Arab nations to keep Palestinians in a ghetto in order to make Israel look bad.  Consider this:  What would England do if Scotland, or Wales,  fired missiles at London and terrorised the country?  What did the UK do in Northern Ireland?  Sent in troops and engaged the IRA.  What is Israel to do when attacked by terroritsts with murderous intent?",

Instead of creating a <b> Nation </b>and taking lands illegally they should have lived in peace in little communities in Israel or in the area.

Many Jews/Israelis are reasonable, however, sadly, there is a core of fanatics, Zionists, call them what you will, who persist in making such unreasonable demands that peace in the region is thereby made IMPOSSIBLE. This isn't a secret. Everyone knows about this, so lets stop pretending. The outside world is now sick to death of this running sore. Sympathy for Israel is now at rock-bottom.

This is done through willful lies by miseducating and misleading the public with their perverted one-sided, anti-Israel, anti-Semitic views and propaganda. \n\nWe has seen your filthy kind throughout history and your STUPID arguments have been bandied about so much that everyone is sick and tired of them.

It has served as a timely reminder to me - and no doubt to anyone else reading it, - just what a bunch of nut-jobs you represent. To be an 'anti-semite' I'd have to actually have to care about your stone-age religion, but I merely hold it in the same contempt as I do ALL other religions that have been used to justify repression, hatred, violence and the continued, endless cycles of grief imposed on generations of children in it's name. Even Communism and Nazism have worked in much the same way. I wouldn't wish to single out Judaeism.\n\nThe reality is that, thankfully, good people do not need yours - or any other religion - to be good, behave well, love - and live in peace.\nThe reality is, that most people don't give a toss about your backward cults, ANY of them - they really simply are not interested. Only those brought-up and indoctrinated/brainwashed from birth live in that bubble - just as with Islam and Muslims. Both of those religions share the same basic fanaticisms and hatreds. What you simply cannot abide is that anyone DARE have ANY opinion that either differs from yours - or does not actively support it. Ironically, you share many of these traits with the Nazis.\n\nIsrael has ignored UN Resolutions for decades. Having stolen land after the war, by violent means, Israel has displaced most Palestinians - and herded them into small pockets of land. Not exactly the Warsaw Ghetto - but uncomfortably close Mr.Ben....\n\nMy father was in the forces during the war. A lot of people gave their lives to free Europe from Nazism. Many Jews fought bravely alongside them. He was then posted to Palestine after the war to try and keep the peace. However - he and his friends were being attacked and killed every day by the very Jews they had fought to free - some of whom had even fought along-side them. Terrorists like the Stern Gang, no different from the IRA, Al-Queida or ISIS. Yes, that was a great thank-you for those lads - for all their sacrifices.\n\nThankfully, I also know that ignorant morons like you do not represent either all Jews - nor all Israelis. I think Israel can have a future - if the moderates can prevail. If the mindless idiots like you prevail - then it will end badly and masses of (Arab) humanity sweep Israel away - as surely as night follows day. If that happens - then 100% of the blame will fall of the brainless fanatics like you. The finger in the dyke is US support - and we all know WHY that support is given. The day that is withdrawn, the whole of the Middle East will descend of Israel. The small bully that hides behind the big guy will get payback - and it won't be pretty. I fervently hope that will not happen, and that peace will prevail, but judging Israel by her actions - it seems almost inevitable. Just because brainless morons like you don't like the TRUTH - doesn't make it 'anti-semitic', it just makes it an unpalatable truth that you have neither the guts not the intelligence to face.",

It is clear you are not a Torah scholar, a historian let alone what Zionism, anti-Semitism truly is and means.  Thus, you simply ignored the points of the great rabbi sacks was making.\n\nZionism in its political form is the national liberation movement of the Jewish people which holds that the Jewish people like any other <b> nation </b>are entitled to a homeland. This is based on the fact that the Jewish<b>  nation</b> are the indigenous people to the land and maintained a continuous presence for 4,000 years as recorded in the Bible and has been proven to be true based on archaeology and history. \n\nTherefore Zionism recognizes that the Yiddishkeit (Jewishness) is defined by shared origin in terms of religion, culture and history, hence the Balfour Declaration. The Balfour Declaration holds categorically that Palestine (the idiom of that time, yet a misnomer) is the national home for the Jewish people. \n\nThe Mandate for Palestine includes the Balfour Declaration and it specifically referred to the \"the historical connection of the Jewish people. . . \" This means the moral validity of \"reconstituting the Jewish homeland as a National Home in Israel as the country of the Jewish people. Therefore the term \"reconstituting\" demonstrates the fact that Palestine (Israel) had been the Jews' home. \n\nFurthermore Zionism is composed and consists of Western values of individuality, equality and freedom. For example the values of freedom of speech, press, dissent, association and religion just to mention a few.\n\nMoreover, Zionism does not discriminate against anyone. Israel is a pluralistic and democratic society and its open character qualities allows everyone to be the best person they can be. It also protects religious and political rights for all its citizens including Christians, Muslims, atheists an all others. Anyone who believes in these values that I mentioned above regardless if they are Jewish or not is a Zionist. \n\nOne more point and that is many who are against Zionism do not really understand the concept because their information is willfully distorted by propaganda which comes from the anti-Semites (the Jew haters). Moral leaders of various faiths have repeatedly warned that anti-Zionism is antisemitism in practice. \n\nThe late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said upon hearing <b> a Blac</b>k student at Harvard launch a tirade against Zionist: \"When people criticize Zionist they mean Jews. You're talking antisemitism.\"\n\nIn conclusion anti-Semites have no facts and others alike are not concerned with truths but resort to falsification of history and fabrications in order to support their evil claims and agendas which their objectives is demonize Israel the Jewish people. This is done through willful lies by miseducating and misleading the public with their perverted one-sided, anti-Israel, anti-Semitic views and propaganda\n\nAnti-Semites have no case whatsoever.",

The people who don't think that Israel should exist should stop chattering and do something about it. They've already tried four times. The next time will, I believe, be the last.",

When a state uses the law to deny a section of its people equal right before the law then I have a problem with that.  Israeli Arabs and Bedoiun Arabs are denied ownership of land and property through rigged laws and <b> racist </b>courts.  When a state forces birth control onto a<b>  black</b<b> > ethni</b>c group then I have a problem with that.  It was discovered that under the guise of State provided medical aid the Ethiopian Jews, and especially the women subjected to both sterilisation and birth control.  The recent inclusion of the hard right wing extremists into the Israeli government is worrying.  If these right wing extremists were in a state other than Israel they could be called neo-nazis.  When politicians who call for the expulsion of Arabs and even talking of gassing them are then included within the Israeli government then you can talk of the similarities with the Nazis.\n\nA foundation legend of Israel is that it was founded on the deaths of millions in the Holocaust.  By following policies of apartheid from South Africa and legalised discrimination against non white and non Jewish citizens it is urinating the memory of the dead<b> .  Na</b>zi Germany did not start with gas chambers they started with legalised discrimination and exclusion of Jewish Germans from society.  The rhetoric of the Israeli right wing and settler movement is following the path of the Nazis.  Never forget the nazis went from the Nuremburg laws to Treblinka.\n\nAnti-semitism is evil.  It has no place in our world.  We have a duty to combat and stand up to evil where ever we see and find it.  Currently the politicians of Israel's hard right are embarking on a dark, dangerous and evil path that echoes Germany of the 1930's.",

I'm all for diversity, but not when it turns violent).\nEven if it is only a vehicle for stupidity (which is debatable: suppression of contraceptives is the first example that comes to mind when i think of badness to have come purely from religion. That alone has contributed to mass suffering in the form of the spread of STDs/STIs, overpopulation and all the misery that comes with that) does that make it ok? even as just a vehicle, it can still amplify our problems (womens rights, <b> homophobia,</b> suppressing freedom of thought and speech, acceptance of other cultures are all problems not unique to religion but certainly aggravated by it). and even aside from that, the vehicle for a problem is still a part of that problem, and one way to solve a problem is to eliminate all the vehicles through which it spreads itself.\n(sorry for the long comment)\n(no i'm not Canadian but i am British, so i still have to apologize for everything ;))",

I guess the thing is, religions are such massive institutions that you are bound to have many good and many bad people within any major religion. And yes, there are examples of good, understanding people overcoming the barriers placed in front of them by religion to collaborate (i think the SESAME project is a nice example of this), but even here they are having to overcome barriers that are at least partially there because of religion, and it is rationality that is helping them to overcome these barriers (i know that was a specific example but you can use it as a general formula for intelligent, sensitive religious people who are having to overcome the barriers set in place by their own religion).\nMy point was more that, while it certainly has the power to conjure some good out of <b> nothing,</b> religion also very definitely has the power to create much evil out of<b>  nothing</b>. I guess our difference in view lies on how these two factors balance out?",

As I sincerely believe none of the major prophets ever actually spoke to God or any angels (as they don't exist) that gives a few options:\na) Jesus, Muhammed, Moses (if he existed, i'm fairly sure the others did at least) were plain barking mad, to the point of hallucinations and talking to things that didn't exist. I doubt this is the truth, as they were all coherent enough to create a major religion.\nb) They were benign and wished to tell white lies to help the world, but incredibly naive with little understanding of human nature and how their prophecies could be abused. Even if this is the truth, this is not a particularly desireable foundation for the moral guiding of the majority of people in the world today\nc) They were malicious, cyncial and power hungry, and created the religions precisely because of the power structures and subordination that could lead on from this. I honestly wish it were not this way, but a few things lead me towards this. Firstly, all these religions were created back in the mists of distant past, where scientific knowledge was at a low and ease of deception was at a high. But there are a few younger \"religions\", which have grown since the ages of enlightenment. Namely Scientology and Mormonism. Now i know this is not a massive sample, but given that these are the only two religions that we've really been able to study the rise of, and they both clearly call into category c, that is already a hint at the true nature of what religion is.\nThen we go searching in the books for clues. Take the most popular book in the world (the Bible) and go right to the very beginning, the opening Genesis, one of the most famous stories to man, and a foundation of Christianity. Even if many Christians no longer believe it as literal truth, many love it for it's moral message. and that message? That we should live in blissful ignorance underneath an untouchable dictatorship, and that the original sin was to gain knowledge and leave the state of blissful ignorant submission under said dictator.\nDoes that, one of the very founding moral stories of Judeo-Christian philosophy (I don't know Islam's genesis story but i suspect it is similar) not scream \"Population control\" to you?\nHence I feel there actually is something wrong with the philosophy of religion, as it seems clear to me that, at their core (for the major monotheistic religions at least), they were created cynically and specifically to allow for oppression and dictatorship, whilst tricking people into being content with their \"spirituality\" and feeling good about themselves as subordinates so they dont rebel.\nP.S. If you read this far, go get yourself a cookie as you fucking deserve it ;) again, sorry for the long comment",

But do you really think the small amount of self-help and comfort it can provide to certain (but not all) individuals, counters the mass pain, suppression, and division it brings upon the masses?\nAlso, if we talk about the effect of religion on individuals, it's not all rosy. I was speaking to a catholic friend recently who is beginning to doubt her faith. One of the things we spoke about was how in her childhood, at a catholic school, all the children were taught that they were sinners. that they were guilty. that they owed it to God and Jesus to follow the rules of the bible, as Jesus had died and suffered for them. Do you think this brings comfort to the individual? telling innocent children as they grow up that they are by default guilty sinners who have to spend their life repaying a debt to God in order avoid eternity in Hell? It certainly had a damaging effect on my friend for much of her life.\nI know that this sort of treatment is not commonplace within christianity anymore, but it has been throughout history, similar mindsets are certainly commonplace in other religions, and i think you'd be surprised at how many christians actually are brought up like this, even today...\n(Again, I know it's a specific example, but I find it a microcosm for much of religion in general)",
