Well, that isn't too surprising if you just rely on the lying MSM for news? Besides, Trump wanted the Senate which is what he has got. He is also just one of a handful of Presidents to increase his number of seats in his first mid-terms. Also look at the much larger numbers that Obumma and Clinton lost in the House in their first mid-terms. And people are not turning against <b> Brexit.</b>That is just wishful thinking on your part.
