They are 100% convinced that all other human beings aren't as loved by Allah as they are, for example they say Asians are dirty and disgusting cause they eat dogs and Indians are disgusting cause they worship cows... etc and each time I start arguing with them about such things they bash me off and start treating me as if I was a Kafira that I'm trying to be open-minded and it's against Allah's rules. I'm sick of trying to the point where I don't even want to argue anymore, I'll let them think the way they think and I feel blessed to not be ignorant about this.\n\nThe bigger problem is the fact that the majority of Arabs are like this that's why we aren't developed and we still have wars and conflicts, I'm not optimistic about this cause the society is so messed up they don't teach love but rather hatred and division.",

Well, if they are indeed truthful, shouldn’t they have the sincere desire to go straight to Jannah [ rather than stay in this world ] ?? They are the “Chosen People of Superiority” after all. But nope! Never will they admit to this because they know they are arrogantly living in their own delusion of superiority which they themselves claimed. Even Allah [s.w.t] NEVER claimed anybody to be superior.\n\nLASTLY, FOR THE DELUDED “CHOSEN PEOPLE OF SUPERIORITY,” ALL OF THE THINGS I’VE SAID ABOVE, ALL OF THE INFORMATION IS THERE IN THE NOBLE QUR’AN, HENCE ALL OF THIS ARE FROM ALLAH’S [ S.W.T ] WORD. SO DON’T BE ANGRY WITH ME. BE ANGRY TOWARDS ALLAH",

It is in quran too when God said ( we have created you in nations and different tribes for you to meet and learn,  the most dignified among you are the ones who consider Allah more)  meaning who truly knew Allah, God,  and respect God teaching,  to be peacefull and wise in  dealing with other cultures.  And one must ask,  why God ask us to travel and learn about people from different race and culture.  Through knowing others we learn new tings about the creator, the universe rules through god's well, and the mysterious beuty in his creation. This also expanding peoples thinking.",

Being black, I'm looked down upon by everyone of every race including my own for being dark skinned. It amazes me how much Arabs here especially those from sham(Syria,Palestine,Lebanon, and Jordan) always ask people in the masjid to pray for their country as we are all Muslims but would not want to stand next to me for salah. Its very hypocritical of them. Many of them are raised this way and its so sad. Thanks for talking about this😭😭",

There's nothing wrong with being proud of your culture but you shouldn't let it make you look at others as below you. \nAlso, not to offend anyone, but at the time before Islam, the ignorance was rampant among Arab tribes. The Quran literally calls it Jahiliyyah, or the Period of Ignorance/Paganism. Worshiping idols, burying their daughters alive, etc. The Prophet (s.a.w.) and the Quran were sent to correct them and \"perfect their character (akhlaq)\". So I think it's inaccurate for Arabs to feel superior for having Islam revealed to their people. It's a beautiful language and a beautiful culture, but again, not inherently better than everyone else.",

Among blacks I grew up with for a time, they would attack the darker skinned among them. I had some trouble for being fair skinned. Among hispanics they idolize fair skin and talk among themselves about who's white in the family. It's everywhere. But I always thought it's might just be a preference most people have of what they admire. Not so much a race thing.I say that because men like Tom Cruise sell at the box office and all races come to see him or men and women like him.",

    "commentText": "Well I have an Indian friend in uni, in the U.K, who lived in Saudi for most of her life before doing 2 years medical boarding school in India after and moving here. She said Saudi is the best and when she lived in India she loved it too but she didn’t feel fully equal to her Indian friends because they view Islam and Arab culture as backwards, ugly and non-progressive or non-beneficial to the world compared to Indian culture. She had no Muslim friends, she truly didn’t fit in anywhere, her own ethnic place or her own religions place. Her dad was a doctor and some of his lazy untalented colleagues (yes Arab) would ask them to do some of their shifts time to time with no pay, he would be depressed but can’t say anything because human rights and equality exists less there. She said the people there seem to lack intelligence, more lazy, apparently their king or something doesn’t even have his personal doctor as Saudi/Arab, he is south asian, which is crazy, as it shows he doesn’t really believe in his people’s capabilities. At least we work hard for our successes and stay humble, and not rely on natural resources or faking our way through. It’s embarrassing. Like without it, I feel like everyone knows the country would still be the squalid undeveloped, medieval-minded place it was before. It saved them man it really did and those arabs (I know not all of them are like that) are undeserving of it in my honest opinion, it’s a waste. Imagine all the good other countries that need help would’ve done with it. I hope they realise that and get off their high horse and come back down to reality, because outside the UAE etc they are nothing. It’s pathetic and cringey. I’ve only met like two in my life, both good people and not fit the horrible descriptions people give them. I won’t treat Arabs any different to anyone else if I ever meet any since my parents taught us some class and values. I know not to generalise. Thank Allah.",

They were invaded by Arabs and so there is some Arabic heritage there in Palestine. But just because you were born in Palestine doesn't mean you're descended from arabs. It's a big mix now of Arab offspring plus Semitic offspring that people's Palestine and I wouldn't doubt even that there's bunches of more people types in Palestine than just semites and arabs. If you want to do some research on it you might google this term: \"Haplo-types of Palestine\", then take each haplogroup you find listed and do additional research on each of those haplotypes and figure out what their migratory route was and what cultures each of those haplotypes were part and then you'll have a real good idea of where the people of Palestine are from.\n\nIt's weird that Palestine is largely peopled by Semitic Muslims, ay? But it's true.\n\nProvisionally, I did the search and came up with these people types as all being part of the population of Palestine: Persians, Turkish, Macedonians (Hitites), Egyptians, Italians, East Africans, South Africans, Greeks, Spaniards, Portugese, French, Moroccans, Berbers... None of which are from The Arabian Peninsula. So the odds are greatest that you're no part Arab, even if you're born in Palestine, where for years the lame media has been pushing the narrative that there's a split between Arabs and Jews. It's just hokey nonsense being sold by the billionaires who like to create division to use in conquering people for the purpose of THIEVERY, stealing their property and the minerals that are buried in it.\n\nIf you want to REALLY KNOW your heritage, get a DNA test, I recommend Family Tree DNA as they'll test for your genetic haplotype. Other \"genetic testing facilities\" make claims to know where you're from, which they can not possibly. So avoid any genetic test that is making claims about the region or place of your ancestry. You can know it if you know where your family is from, but they can't know it by testing your genes. So don't believe the fraud. But get your genes tested by a genetic testing facility that reports your HAPLOTYPE and then do the research on your own as to what MIGRATIONS your GENETIC HAPLOTYPE has endured. You should recognize in those common migrations someplace where you've been told your family is from.",

After oil, the Khalijees will not suffer, you are ignorant to the economic precautions they've taken to combat when the oil rates begins falling. By the way, a Jihadist is one that struggles, Jihad means to struggle or rise up against struggle. Your definition of Jihad is incorrect.

Sudan is an Arabic word for land of the blacks, you are calling Arabs the bad guys by referring to people of an Arabic name? Hmmm... that doesn't make sense. Afghani is a nationality that in fact could refer to an Arab inhabiting the country (listen to the anthem) \n\nAccording to the anthem, Afgans include: \n\nBalochs, Uzbeks, Pashtuns, Hazaras, Turkmen, Tajik, Arabs, Gujjars, Nuristani, Brahuis, Qizilbash, Aimaqs, Pashais. \n\nNorth Africans include Amazigh and Copts. Amazigh are around, their culture is still vibrant, and they've adopted Islam. Copts are Christian Egyptians, they are around, and we live in harmony with them. Anyone who disturbs that peace is an extremist. East Africans are Sub-Saharan, we haven't engulfed any of their cultures, they are around, and in vast numbers. Somali do not call themselves Arabs, they practice Somali culture, they are proud Somali.

Death cult? Suicide is haram, hope you know that. Saudi Arabians are fat? That stereotype is reserved for another people.

No, you can't have an expanding empire without war, that's not logical. \n\nISIS actually does many haram things, suicide is haram, they don't follow the ten rules of war, rape is haram. Islam affects peoples cultures, even the Arabs cultures. Look at Arab culture before and after Islam, very different. It doesn't destroy them though, that's wrong. Europeans trying to solve problems in the Middle East? Many Europeans are angry at the refugee crisis, not because children are suffering or people are dying, but because it's flooding their countries. It's what happens when you lie to a people group, divide them into unnecessary nations, ignore other ethnicities (Kurds), implement weak puppet monarchs, and all for some oil. Look at what the French, British and Italy did in their colonies! Now they complain because those same people are coming back to bite them. Look at how the west messed up Afghanistan, you supported the Mujahadeen, and they then become Al-Qaeda. You know what happened from there. \n\nYes... and according to you, only Khalijee are Arab, but all Khalijee are rich and can thank their oil for that. I completely agree with you when you say they depend on the west. Sauds are US puppets, and look at what they do to poor people in Yemen. Also, Jordan, Lebanon, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco are all succeeding and good countries. Arabs actually weren't strict before Islam, they were barbaric tribal people who would steal from each other. But that was over a thousand years ago, we can't compare the people then to the people now. Yet look at what Sauds are doing in Yemen. Also, there is a difference between Salafism and Islam. Salafism is a strict interpretation of Islam, amd not Islam itself. Don't mistaken it for Islam. \n\nThere are Arabs who still call blacks by this name, just as there are whites whom my refer to them as things that are even worse. I'm not sure where you get anything that Egyptians were slaves of the Arabs. Please go look at why Arabs were so easily able to take Egypt.",

They wanted to implement a government that leans in their favor, so while they don't directly administer these countries, we are still under their heavy influence. You are right, some of this stuff is self-imposed. It wasn't a Brit who poisoned Gamel Abdel Nasser, it was an Egyptian, our own people, betraying our beloved Gamel Abdel Nasser, just like that. But in fact, it is somewhat to blame of our colonizers, they were the one's who left us with these weak forms of government. Look what it cost us in the long run, if Britian would just mind their own business, none of this would have probably happened. \n\nISIL had nothing to do with Europeans? Weren't European countries (UK and Poland) the ones whom aided in the Iraq invasion of 2003, the same invasion that took down it's government, and put ISIL in power. There are many prosperous Muslim nations. Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Malaysia, Kuwait, Brunei, Qatar, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Albania, Bosnia and Tajikistan. These countries are doing pretty well. Even countries like Iran are well developed, they just aren't doing too well politically and diplomatically. \n\nThe Lebanese along with any other Arabs are well liked, whether we are Muslim or not. Syria is not in this state because of Islam. ISIL and Al-Qaeda are groups don't aren't part of the original reason for the war. It began because of conflict between the people and the government, initiated by the Arab spring. An utter failure in Egypt. The Assad regime is secular, not a theocracy.",

I don't know where you get this from, but it's wrong. Also, Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him was indeed a war leader, there's nothing wrong with that. He was simply a general, there is nothing wrong with any general. Under him, they conquered almost all of Arabia, not even Al-Sham, Anatolia, Persia, Maghreb, Egypt, Indus River, Central Asia, Caucasus or Spain. These expeditions were made after his by the Khalifa that came after him. There were supremacist leaders like the oppressive Umayyad's, but that doesn't mean all of Islam is bad, simply because some Muslim leaders were bad. It should be noted that the Muslim community themselves were very angry at Umayyad's, hence the Abbasid revolution and why they killed any Umayyad leader that they could find or get a hold of. It was the medival ages, of course things like this happened. Things like this happen even in the modern age. I would also like to say, that even before the Khalifa, there were Arabs in Al-Sham and the lands of Iraq (which is considered Al-Sham sometimes?)",

Brother, wjat you say about Khalijee is true, I don't disagree with you on this. Indeed they do depend on the west, but they are also diversifying their economies to brace for the price fall when oil begins becoming rare. Women are oppressed, although if your taking about Hijab I think you should know that majority Saudi men wear Kufiya a lot. I didn't know that they stopped cutting people's hands off, it's disgusting that they ever thought of doing so, something so barbaric, so uncivilized. I didn't beg anyone for help, no one is helping out the Egyptians, no one has helped out the Egyptians. I'm not putting the entire blame on the Brits, French or Italians, even the Spanish took some of the Arab world (*ahem ahem* western Sahara) but it wasn't us who implemented these weak monarchs. We were also lied to and left alone when the Sauds invaded Hejaz, allowing them to spread their strict interpretation of Islam. We couldn't stop them, what could we do? We can't fix our countries when they are run by foolish and horrible leader's. Name one good thing that Hosni Mubarak has ever done. Eastern Europe is better than us because they were able to successfully able to implement a good government system. We can't do that because we are confused and divided, we just keep starting conflicts, when will they stop? How do we even stop them? I mean, look at Iraq. In a couple years, probably a decade or so, it'll probably be better than it's ever been. Why? A good and stable government. But what do you expect us to do in Egypt? We've lost our chance to do anything, protesting won't help. I'm sure what really we could do here. Communism and dictatorship in both South and North Yemen have have severely damaged the two countries, the dictatorship still went on even into the newly unified Yemeni state. But then the Arab spring came along and just triggered a civil war, now what do they do? Europe is doing great because even before the two wars they were great major powers, those conflicts and wars have passed on. But we are still dealing with conflict, war, and bad government. Arab countries like Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco are okay because they managed to go on without conflict, but look at Libya, they are in a civil war, how do you expect them to develop in this situation. \n\nSyria, Libya, and Yemen are in civil war. \n\nIraq and Lebanon just recently came out of a civil war. \n\nLebanon and Jordan are dealing with a refugee crisis, they are not rich countries like Britian or Germany, they cannot as easily combat this.\n\nEgypt is dealing with a horrible military dictatorship. \n\nOn top of this, Khalijee aren't even bothering even try to host any refugees.",

I don't know anyone who has married their cousins, but while it may be seen as taboo in the west, it's not in other places. I'm really not sure about here, because I don't know anyone who's married their cousin. Although a lot of what your saying is not factual information but simply assumptions, trying to make out of this and for some reason not bothering to do any proper research. Islam says nothing of joining ISIL, almost everything ISIL is doing is haram. \n\nSuicide is haram, rape is also haram. Slavery I don't believe is specifically haram, but Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him tried hard to abolish slavery. In fact, he married women to release them of their bonds.

That's not why their prospering, astughfirallah they should completely remove of any form of prostitution, it's extremely disgusting. Whether you are Muslim or not, this should be common sense. Good on Tajikistan, there is no where saying women have to cover their heads, wear burqa's or hijabs. But they've done more then simply ban burqa's for cultural preservation, the president has done some things to restrict Muslim belief, and for a country that is over 90% muslim. Iran is still a Islamic theocracy where 99.99% of the population is Muslim, some Iranians teens becoming lax or atheists doesn't mean anything.  Actually, incest is very haram, tons of hadith (sunnah) is highly incorrect, and the prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him never married his cousin, actually, it was his cousin which married his daughter. That's not incest, and his cousin was much younger then him. ISIL should know what their doing is haram, just because some hooligans running around in guns, spreading violence, claiming their doing good in the Islam, does not automatically mean that these people are following the rules and teachings of Islam. Like I said, tons of things their doing is haram. And do some research if you'd like to know as to why ISIL is a thing. ISIL was founded by a salafist in 1999, I'm pretty sure it had no actual significance or relevance at this point, but what put them in power was the fall of Saddam Hussein which basically collapsed the entire government making it easy for them to come to power. Like the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, they want to get rid of foreigners like the west but they are also trying to conquer as much as they can and impose their strict salafist beliefs. And no, it doesn't sexually repress anyone, its just says to keep from doing disgusting haram things.",

Islam is not Arab culture, it's an Abrahamic religion like Judaism or Christianity. In Ramadan, Bangladesh does not feast on Arab food, they do so on Bengali food, same thing with Indonesia, Kazkhstan, Somalia, and literally every other non-Arab muslim country. No... Zaynab was no his cousin, never was. Also, where do you get that we marry later? I understand that we might marry in our mid-20s, but this isn't late not for us. Even so, this is mostly likely a modern thing. I do think I've been told that at the time of my great grandparents that people would marry around the age of 16 or 18.

Stop assuming stuff, look at history! Even Arabs were changed by Islam, yes, their vocabulary may have some Arabic words or they may use the Arabic alphabet, but the English, Spanish, Dutch, French and Portuguese have forced many people to follow their religions, speak their languages and follow their traditions. Many natives were assimilated into the language of the Spaniards, and many Africans, American Natives and even some places in Asia were forced to convert to Christianity! French and English are highly spoken in Africa, much more then Arabic! Same thing with the Americas, but with Spanish instead of French. Vietnamese uses Latin alphabet, not Arabic, not their own, same thing with many African languages, and other East Asian countries. Lots of Central Asia was highly influenced by the Secularist Communist Rooskies, its not a surprise that the government in Tajikistan is how it is right now. Even today, they are heavily influenced by Rooskies. They use the Cyrillic alphabet, not Arabic. It's not Islam that plays fear, it's the Muslims. You are mistaking Salafist terriosts for Islam. So what if it's in Arabic? Most of our prophets are not Arabic, in fact, only two of our prophets were even Arab. Majority of them are Jews. It's in Arabic for fear of lost of meaning through translation or mistranslation, why are some Christian studies in Hebrew or Latin? Why are some Jewish studies in Hebrew? Arabic norms? I already said, it has nothing to do with Arabs, you think it does because Arabs instead follow these norms, and you mistaken that for Arabs following their own norms instead. How is prostitution disgusting? You don't find that a women is making a show of herself simply for money at all even somewhat disgusting? Or that someone would pay a women for her to show herself at all disgusting? Yes, to a degree it is disgusting. Were not afraid of it, you just shouldn't do it before your married, that's all. \n\nIf you want to view it as a disease go ahead. But to add a few things:\n\n1. If your going to speak of the actions of the Muslims themselves or even \"Muslims\" blaming their doings on Islam, refer to the Ummah, not the Deen. \n\n2. ISIL does not fulfil anything to do with Islam, they instead are attempting to grew an empire with themselves at its head. They are using Islam as a cover, and they are also trying to us force people into it, using it. It's not Islam, it's just hooligan terriosts. How can these people be considered Muslims if they don't even truly follow Islam? Think about it.\n\n3. Salafism or Wahabism is a extreme interpretation of Islam. Not Islam itself. Even Muslims themselves think sharia is a flawed system, laws made by people from centuries ago.",

Most of Arabs to me look more natural in their own skin shade, when they lighten it up, they don’t look natural and it’s a fake look. Facial features are very important in that, not only colors. I’ve see fair Arabs on the internet and they have Arabic features despite their fair complexion. I just don’t think anyone should change their skin tone, they look good in their natural way.",

We are an Ummah, if we have a problem we will solve it TOGETHER, but we need to remain united as MUSLIMS. All races have racism and inequality issues, no surprise there. So instead of bashing one race, and quite frankly being just as racist.. Just watch the video and agree. We all have suffered racism at one point or another so we get that everyone has had bad experiences but people don't make other Arab brothers and sisters feel unwelcome or harassed. South-Asians, Asians, Arabs and all the other nations do have problems involving racism. Don't take one horrible person as an example and paint an entire race, religion or nation with hatred.",

I find this is very disrespectful as a non Arab who learned Arabic and the verse does exist you can search (thankfully learning Arabic  allowed me to see the truth behind all of the good glazed things that Arabs and their religion claim) so it's pretty normal why a lot of the Arabs think they are superior.",

I think these people are really turning many people away from Islam  because of how they treat others. Please try to correct yourselves and follow the prophet (s) accordingly.\n “There is no difference between an Arab and a non Arabs except piety” لا فرق بين عربي ولا أعجمي الا بالتقوى \n\nWhy Arabs in particular are imitating the Jewish. In order to be Jewish you need to have Jewish blood. Because God ‘chose’ them. Unfortunately, they understood the meaning wrong. God chose them at the time because of their faith. I feel bad when for the muslims when they keep on complaining about the racism in the West. I would recommend to resolve the issue of racism in Middle East then we can have the privilege to talk and correct other nations.",

At first things were lovely and picture perfect, and I've had a lot of Saudi friends and no offense but I've noticed the ones from the eastern providence such as Safwa and especially Al qatif come off as if they are better, richer, and more important, arrogant. \nThey flash their expensive items and belongings, money, designer wear, and act as if you are beneath them. It's disgusting and wrong! \nAnd the way men treat woman is as if they are meat. A lot of saudis I've witnessed have wives back home or fiancés and they come here have sex with multiple girls and have babies leaving them behind after promising their mothers the world, false hope, and partying, drinking, drugs, and it goes on and on. \nIt breaks my heart that the mothers and women/ wives back in Saudi have no clue. \n\nAgain I'm not racist, I mean come on my children are Saudi, and I love the Arab / Saudi culture and everything about it, but I can't stand others who are arrogant, liars, and come off as if you are nothing but trash beneath them. \nThere is good and bad people all over. Just be wise and take care of yourself, And of course trust your instincts. \n\nI love arabs and the cultures. And I will always defend arabs and Muslims. \n\nInshallah the world will wake up one day and become a better uniting place. \nMuch love.",

I remember that there was this huge Eid party and me and my siblings were playing on the bouncy castles when other children (Much older than us, they were like 14) would threaten us. They'd say things like ''You're not real Muslims, you're Danes! You can't be here! I bet you brought your pig meat as well!'' (This was in the Arabic Eid party, our mosques were based on ethnicity which is just horrible) This made me very sad, and soon enough i began throwing away aspects of my Danish culture. I didn't grow up with Arabic as my second language like all of the other kids, so i started to say things wrong, Grammarly incorrect, just so they'd see me as one of their own. My friend also talked very bad about Somalis and Danes, and she'd very often talk down to me.",

I can only apologize for her actions and that’s it. You can’t spend your life trying to change a stone!

As soon as it came time for him to find a wife, his parents openly told him to \"dump the Spanish girl.\" And he did! He just got married to an Arab girl and dropped my friend without warning! He just stopped talking to her and months later, she ran into him at a fucking diner eating with his wife. When she confronted him, he casually told his wife \"oh, she's just some Spanish chick I used to hang out with.\"  That's fucked up.",

People speak Arabic now and have parts of the culture, because they too were conquered by Arabs centuries ago, yet they seem to forget that fact. Palestinians are a mixture of the original Semitic peoples of the Levant who were living there long before Arab conquest, and non-Mideast ancestry from Europe, Asia, and sometimes Africa. Most of the people in my family look like nothing like Arabs anyway, and the ones that do, well it's because they simply look Semitic like their Semitic ancestors of the Levant did thousands of years ago. It's not like Saudis or Gulf Arabs would be very accepting of us anyway, so why kiss their asses and wish to be one of them?",

My classmate, who was Libyan, and I were discussing something about the Qur'an and he quoted a verse I didn't know the meaning of. He immediately goes oh why don't you understand this? Because I am not an Arab or a scholar?! I have had this time and time again (not in the same context) but a lot of Arabs like to make other non Arabs feel inferior. \n\nOne time we went to Dubai and at the airport, while leaving, the security guys would stop all non Arab looking people and check their luggage. When an obviously Arab looking guy passed by he would point to his passport in his pocket to the security guys and say \"Arab Arab\" and they would let him leave. \n\nAlso, Arabs would give more respect to a white person from the West than a non white person from say South East Asia.",

Also, there is zero Political Correctness in the Arab World. So many times there'll be remarks that would be considered racist in the West. Because I have a much darker skin tone than my whole extended family, my Grandma once joked about me being \"Abed al Aswad\" which literally means the Black Slave. My Grandma isn't a racist (hell, she's of mixed race herself) but when you're raised with statements like this being normal, it grows on you and eventually passes on generation to generation. As the new generation, we, the youth of the Arab World must put an end to this. However, it's not like people of colour are mistreated and not given a role to play in society, it's just that we grow up with these shitty thoughts that are very wrong.",

    "commentText": "Sheikh-ul-Islam, Ibn Taymiyyah (ra) was of the opinion that Arabs ARE SUPERIOR (Afdal) than Non-Arabs and he claimed that this was the view that was held by the MAJORITY of the scholars – ‘Al-Jamhoor’- .\n\nHe wrote: “And the MAJORITY of scholars are of the opinion that the Arab species is better (Afdal) than the Non-Arab (species) just as the nation of Quraish is better (Afdal) than the Non-Quraishite nations and (just as) the nation of Bani Haashim is better (Afdal) than the Non-Bani Haashim (nations).” Majm’u Al-Fataawa 19/29\n\nHe also wrote: “…This was the position of Imam Ahmed (ra) and the MAJORITY of Ahlul ‘Ilm.” Iqtidaa As-Siraatil-Mustaqeem 2/421\n\nAlso, refer to what he said in Majmu’ Fataawa 27/472.\n\nUnfortunately, when discussing the issue of the ‘Afdaliyyah’ or superiority of the Arabs over the ‘Ajamees’ (Non-Arabs), many people fail to do justice to this hotly debated topic.\n\nSheikh-ul-Islam, Ibn Taymiyyah (ra) wrote:\n\n“Verily, what Ahlul Sunnah is upon: Is the BELIEF (I’tiqaad) that the Arab race is better (Afdal) then the Non-Arab race. Whether (the Non-Arabs) are Hebrews, Aramaic, Romans, Persians and other than them…”. Iqtidaa As-Siraatil-Mustaqeem 2/419\n\nAbu Muhammad, Harb ibn Ismail ibn Khalaf Al-Kirmaany (died 280 – ra) who was one of the students and companions of Imaam Ahmed (ra) also mentioned this point when he wrote about the descriptions and BELIEFS of the PEOPLE OF THE SUNNAH.\n\nHe began his treatise by saying:\n\n“This is the Madhab of the Imams of ‘Ilm and the ‘Ashaab-ul-Athar’ and (the people of) Ahlus Sunnah – who are the ones who are followed – (and they) are well known by these (issues).\n\nAnd I met those who I met from the Ulemah of Iraqand the Hijaz and As-Sham and other than them and they were upon these (issues).\n\nAnd this was the madhab of AHMED, ISHAQ IBN IBRAHIM IBN MAKHLAD (RAAHUWIYAH), and ABDULLAH IBN AZ-ZUBAIR AL-HUMAYDEE and SA’EED IBN MANSUR and other than them from those who I sat with and took knowledge from.\n\nThey used to say Emaan (faith) consists of (making) statements, (doing) actions and (having) the Niyyah…”\n\nImam Harb ibn Ismail (ra) then proceeded to mention many of the well known issues of the Aqeedah of Ahlul-Hadith and then he said:\n\n“…And we know the rights of the Arabs and (we know) their VIRTUE and their PRECEDENCE (in the Deen) and we love them because of the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him): “Loving the Arabs is from Emaan and hating them is hypocrisy”.\n\nAnd we do not say as the ‘Shu’oobiyah’ (those who hate the Arabs) and (as) the lowly ones from the ex-slaves (say) who do not love the Arabs and they don’t recognize their virtues, for verily their statement is a BIDAH” and (it’s) in contradiction”.\n\nIt should be noted that the Hadith that was used by Imam Harb ibn Ismail ibn Khalaf Al-Kirmaany (ra): “Loving the Arabs is from Emaan and hating them is hypocrisy” is not an authentic Hadith! Even though it’s a famous and widely used Hadith, it should not be used to prove a point in Aqeedah!",

Yet, its so deep rooted into all cultures that explaining makes no difference to some people- but I will never give up. We need to remember that our African, Afro-Caribbean, African American and dark skin brothers and sisters are treated most unjustly by other Muslims.

So just because you guys have had bad experiences with Arabs, all of a sudden we should be ashamed of our \"superiority complex\"? The truth is, we are proud people. We are brought up like that, though people should not mistake it for ignorance to other races. Like, just because we take pride in our culture and history, As we should, suddenly that's a bad thing? And for all those Indians or people 'of color', It is actually YOUR OWN people who will teach you that lighter skin is more beautiful than darker skin, same goes to Somali's etc. Don't blame us Arabs for your retarted upbringing. It's not like we haven't go enough stereoptypes to deal with already. Subhi i don't know why you take pride in putting your culture own people down, but then again, you're entitled to your own opinion, just don't claim it as a \"fact\" and generalise the entire Arab World. Shame, i thought you were brighter than that. I guess not. Unsubscribed.",

Heating up the situation about arabs feeling superior at this specific moment couldnt be more worse. We are already being taken down by an huge anti-arab storm, but oh lets just add this to it aswell. Are you really trying or thinking that you will solve this situation, or just create a platform for haters to come hate. Just take a look at the comment section, well done great job.",

This is the very reason why so many people don't talk about problems like this because they're too concerned about what other people will think or say. I mean if you really truly acknowledge how dangerous and detrimental racism is within the Muslim communities you'll want to bring a change this instance and not wait until the 'hate dies down'. There will always be people hating from within the religion and outside of it. It's quite worrying to me that you think this way.",

I like having friends from all parts of the world and somehow I found myself getting along with Pakistanis and Indians really well, and the other day we had a group project in my biology class where my Indian friend and I were put into a group with two other local girls. They were literally talking to us in such a mean way until they asked me if I were Arab and when I told them where I'm from, their tone with me changed COMPLETELY, but they were still treating my friend like shit. I got so pissed. I'm still so pissed. I don't understand why they think they're so superior. We're all equal. We all come from the same God; where we're from does not make us superior nor inferior.",

    "commentText": "happened to me a few months back when my friend and her mother (arab) came over to visit me after i was in a crash ( i survived lol) but the thing was both my friend and her mother dont speak urdu even tho they have been here for 20+ year ( in pakistan.) my friend was born in Pakistan. It was very hard for our moms to talk and my mum tried to speak a bit of arabic which im sure she butchered, i could see my mum trying but when my mum suggested her mom to learn basic urdu so that they can hang out and interact she kinda bluntly said arabic is the most  \"aala\" language of all. which i dont argue with at all ( for her it might be ) and i myself would love to learn arabic. i do consider arabs blessed  but when it comes out of someones mouth like that . it does kinda hurts. Don't get me wrong here i do think of arabic as the most beautiful language but thinking ur better than someone on the basis of a language sounds wrong. the thing is they didnt even realize and probably had no intention of being rude . \np.s i love my friend and her mom too. they are nice folks.",

    "commentText": "Islam, Somalia & The Horn of Africa  \n\n\"There is no doubt that occupants of Ethiopia (at that time a much larger area that included most of the horn of Africa: Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia) accepted Islam before Syria, Iraq, Yemen or Egypt because they embraced it before the migration to Medina.\" Sheikh 'Abd al-Qadir 'Uthman 'Abd al-Salam\n\nHabasha & The First Migration \n\nSheikh Khalid Dawudi wrote,\n\n\"Habasha (during the Prophet's time) encompassed the entire Horn of Africa (Djibouti, Eretria, Ethiopia, and Somalia). It was the first country outside of Mecca where the Qur'an was recited, acts of worship were observed, and Islam spread. Some of the Prophet's followers migrated there because he (sa) commanded them to since there was a just ruler there.\"\n\nThe Port City of Zeila, The Companions, and Najashi\n\nSheikh Dawudi wrote,\n\n\"The companions (ra) entered the horn of Africa through Zeila (A port city in the northwestern Somaliland), through Harar until they reached Ifad (Now a village named after Najash that houses a mosque, his grave and the grave of around 15 companions.) Because of that, most historians contend that Somalia embraced Islam early on - during the first migrations to Ethiopia!”\n\nI hope Khatib's will use these points this Friday and address the vital role Somalia has played in Islam's history.\n\nBySuhaib Webb",

And when these arabized sudanese started migrating to other arab countries they would often get the shock of their lives when they realize that all along they've been a Black ppl wearing white masks and that other arabs from the Levant and Gulf actually looked down at them and viewed them as 3abeed, resulting in an acute crisis of identity. A similar thing happened when self-identifying arab sudanese immigrated to north america and much to their disappointment, realized that here too they were just another group of Black ppl. It's a surrea tragicomedy largely of their own making.",

I say we to not exclude myself from the group 😂😂😂 plus the political issues take part in deepening that more.

And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise.\" Allah also mentions that amongst these Arabs, there are those who believe in Allah (good Arabs). The poster is right. There is a reason why Allah sent the Qu'ran to the Arabs, at that time they were the worst of people and amongst other things like the beauty in the Arabic language. Now to correct your arrogance, brother. Arabs are not the teachers of Islam. Every Muslim is a teacher of Islam. We teach others literally or by our actions. What you're saying as is against the teachings of Muhammad (SAW). You are propagating superiority, do not do that brother. Arabs, Indians, Somalis, Europeans, and what have you are all equal except in good deeds. I repeat Arabs are not the teachers of Islam as Islam belongs to Allah only. Don't forget that Islam existed before Muhammad (SAW). It existed through Abraham, Musa (who was black), and Isa ibn Maryam. Islam was perfected in Arabia, but it started with Abraham. Don't forget your place brother, we are all on equal footing in learning the deen. If you were born Arab say Alhamdullilah that Allah has given you an easier time in learning his words. But do not think you are superior to those who weren't born Arab as they will earn rewards when reading the Qu'ran. Read more brother, the great scholars came in all shapes, colors, regions, etc. Persian, Ethiopian, Roman, Arab, Egyptian, etc. Allah is our teacher and we are ALL students of Islam. Salam.",

Well, if they are indeed truthful, shouldn’t they have the sincere desire to go straight to Jannah [ rather than stay in this world ] ?? They are the “Chosen People of Superiority” after all. But nope! Never will they admit to this because they know they are arrogantly living in their own delusion of superiority which they themselves claimed. Even Allah [s.w.t] NEVER claimed anybody to be superior.\n\nLASTLY, FOR THE DELUDED “CHOSEN PEOPLE OF SUPERIORITY,” ALL OF THE THINGS I’VE SAID ABOVE, ALL OF THE INFORMATION IS THERE IN THE NOBLE QUR’AN, HENCE ALL OF THIS ARE FROM ALLAH’S [ S.W.T ] WORD.

I believe it’s the history that our countries hold and just traits they pick up from their parents.. for example parents that feel superior over other nationalities will show it in front of their kids because they were raised not knowing it’s bad so their children pick up from it as well.. that and the lack of education without being up any examples because I do not wish to insult any race. In the end I believe that Quran and Islam play a minor role in this. If anything Islam teaches us to be more humble and we all know that some Arabs (not all) neglect most of the good traits Islam teach us",

But I was once told that since I didn't know how to speak \"real\" Arabic, I wasn't Arab. According to the person who told me that, being Arab is defined by your ability to speak Arabic and I was excluded from being one because Algerian Arabic is far from its classical roots. That encounter sort of made me self conscious about my identity. So I started identifying myself as Algerian period. See how us Arabs even discriminate within our own \"race\".",

Ethnically I do have some Berber blood (like all Algerians whether they acknowledge it or not) and some Turkish ancestry as well. But it's hard to pin point my ethnicity. Us Algerians have known centuries of colonialism and migration that I can't really trace back my ancestry (believe me I tried and it's frustrating not knowing).

Growing up I used to think they were the better muslims, we asians were some how lower class. Its only now years on do I see the problem with that. I mean it still exists in both communities. I went to a Muslim majority high school and I was looked down upon for brown skinned. Racist rhetoric was just seen as the norm.The worst was when I went hajj though. To go into the area with the  prophet's grave they split everyone by country, my mum and my sister was with me and we're all brown girls so despite being Australian they pushed us in with all the Pakistani/Bengali/Indian people. I have no issue with being put with that group but my issue was that the people in charge decide that it was appropriate to split everyone by country, then to have all the people of Arab decent go through first because some how their prayers are much more important than mine. In the end we waited for hours and we didn't even get to go in, we ended up having to go back another day and had to have the Arab members of the hajj group we went with help us get in.",

Also, I am really disappointed in the Arabs calling our Black Muslims “Abd” instead of “Sowd”, and using religion to justify that. You cannot call someone “Abd” and justify it using religion without adding “Allah” (Like, we are all Abed Allah but when you remove the God part you’re literally just calling someone a slave- and that’s racist).",

Majority, unfortunately look down upon black Muslims and will only engage with black Muslims if they are mixed, Somali, or an imam or sheikh. It gets becomes such an issue that some will not eat with black people from the same dish. As well as they think that one cannot be a South African Zulu Muslim and not be 'beautiful' or have a 'nice sharp nose' but rather immediately think that you are Somali, or Sudanese or whatever. This is such a sad thing to see and experience especially considering the fact that the Prophet Muhammad (saw) and Allah (SWT) clearly said that it is wrong to think that you are above anyone. May all racism, prejudice, pride and any sign of evil attributes, attitudes and behaviour be removed from us and may we be an understanding and tolerating ummah. Ameen.",

I often witness the indirect racist remarks us Arabs make unintentionally, especially of the desi community. The desi community in the Middle East are riducled and bashed, Arabs make their beliefs a mockery, and some Arab Muslims feel superior because they speak and read Arabic, so they don't have to invest so much time in trying to read Qur'an because it's their native language. But majority of Arabs own internalised hate for their own selves, you can kind of see it when they immediately want to befriend someone of Cacausian descent or someone with an \"ajnabi\" passport. I apologise to anyone who had to deal with us, and some of our racist remarks, and the unwanted cultural situations we put you in, just because we're Arab. I hope that made sense.",

If they actually did this, the problem you mentioned as well as many other problems in Muslim countries would not exist! Being just, fair, not racist and treating others equally and with respect and dignity are the underpinnings of our religion. There is a reason we are mandated to complete Hajj. At Hajj every color, race, and social class stands in the same clothes next to each other, because no one is better then anyone else and we are all servants of Allah (swt). We always get mad at American's for conflating culture with religion, yet sometimes I think so many Muslims in Muslim countries don't know the difference between culture and religion either! Half of the things that happen in Muslim countries are completely antithetical to Islam.",

        "commentText": "Tazzy never makes fun of arabs. That's mostly when she invites her friends in her videos to spoof certain stereotypes for instance her arab friends spoofs arab men, and tazzy herself spoof south asians. Anyways sometimes as a muslim it can get hard to not get angry at the racism in the community, but I think in the end you can't really change what people say or if they think you'll never be a good muslim just because you aren't arab. As much as it hurts in the end you just move on, and you do things you love, and leave the rest to Allah. And for me being the control freak I am, that is hard to do because my first (not best) reaction is to immediately trash talk people who are racist or be racist back, to take control of the situation and make them feel equally as hurt. But that's probably not even going to change their minds tbh. And my time is worth so much more than trying to prove to people who don't like me for something I can't help that I'm good enough. I don't do it for white racists or arab racists or any type of racists. I think putting your mental health over what the haters say is very important, and just block if you have too. Hopefully if we makes small changes as a whole the Ummah gets better, InshaAllah the racism towards each other ends",

Of course this doesn't apply to everyone, most of the 3arabs I knew were lovely and some of my closest friends are arabs but there was always that group of people that referred to you as a \"bengali\" or \"hindi\" in a derogatory tone like it was an insult or something. Little did they know there's a difference between Pakistan, Bangladesh and India and Hindi is actually a language, not an ethnicity lmao. Also some ignorant people used to just assume all desis are hindus unless you wear hijab? Like they were legitimately surprised if you told them you could read Qur'an or something loool. Disrespecting other religions was another thing but that's really common in a lot of Muslim majorities (like Pakistan), not just arabs.\n\nBut like a said, I only encountered a couple of people who did this most of the arabs I knew were very loving and accepting and actually really liked desi culture, as I did theirs",

While after looking into it you are correct. The Quran does not specifically say that Arabs are the chosen people. And truth be told the prophet did say Arabs are no better than non Arabs. Those who remain steadfast in prayer and fasting and truly believe in allah and the last day are the ones who are superior in the eyes of allah compared to disbelievers. However masjid al aqsa is in fact in Jerusalem which is in palestine and or Israeli occupied/ stolen territory. But I thinks facts point to where the location of the masjid really is.",

Not to mention the sense of superiority arabs hold against each other, between countries and even in their own countries (the more someone resembles a white person, the more they're shown kindness and respect and vice versa).

Even though I have not been brought up in India, or even been to the country, it's surprising to see that some cultures believe that they are higher that others even away from what would be referred to as 'home'. Thank you for bring up this issue and making people realise that God is still above all and since all of humankind is equal in his eyes, why can't we be equal in each other's eyes.

It was the fact that they followed a strict code of \"ethics\" that valued genealogy and the ability to trace ancestors back to hundreds of years which they believed reflected back on one's personal conduct. It didn't only target non-Arabs as this superiority complex manifested itself in inner-Arab tribal rivalries. Islam came and introduced laws that improved race relations, especially among the first generation of Muslims in Arabia .. it strongly encouraged the freeing of slaves generally and as an atonement for certain crimes. Sadly, it didn't ban it altogether. Muslim Arabs went from having the first black secretary of treasury (Bilal bin Rabah) in Medina in the early days of the Muslim state to enslaving people of all colors in later generations, including white Europeans (Saqalibah). That is not to say it was only practiced by Arabs .. most cultures did it. The only difference is that as Muslims, Arabs struggled to reconcile their pre-Islamic traditions with a new religion that emphasized the equality of all races. This feeling of superiority is a remanent of days past and is mainly discussed behind closed doors since it is frowned upon religiously and morally.",

It's not our fault that just because we have similar heritage as of Hindus,  that we have to adopt evrything of theirs. \n\nIf pakistani culture is influenced by Hindus,  Bollywood,  India etc  then let it be as long as it is islamic (respecting elders, getting a good education,  working hard etc)\n\n just because (others).... they're arab doesn't mean they're better Muslims!! That's a huge generalization! \n\nSo I think it goes both ways, arab superiority and arab praise from non arab culture. \n\nLike stay muslim and stick to your culture! \nAnd if there's anything unislamic in your culture,  don't follow it or simply just try your best to fix it or find a solution to it. ....NO need to make your own children feel bad about the culture they were born in. \n\nI think a lot of pakistani ppl don't like how pakistanis get major influence from Bollywood whereas Arabs get major influence from their being arab and their history and how they come from the land/race (?)  The prophet came from\n\nI'm not saying that the ethnicities I mentioned  (turks,  Arabs, Indonesians) can't be good or better Muslims than pakistanis. .all I'm saying is that saying evry single one of them is good and flawless is plain dumb and stupid. \n\nAlthough I do agree that in some areas,  other Muslims are better compared to pakistani Muslims.\n\nIdk ..I maybe wrong",

Indonesian is a group of ethnicities and races like javanese, bugis, balinese, malay, papuans, arab, chinese or indian descents. Indonesia is not the same like Turkey or most of middle eastern countries that is homogeneous. We are heterogeneous and multicultural society but we have identity and our own uniqueness. I know it's not really important but just FYI\n\nAnd about the video, I think what he said is not to underestimate his own ethnicity(arab) but just to emphasize that everyone is same just like what Allah says in Quran. Of course I'm sure he's proud of his culture but he aimed it to racists that are still exist in arab society who look down people who are not arab. I've heard it many times from Indonesians who live in Middle East like in SA. At least we need more people who think like Subhi in this way",

People tend to either cluster Turkey in the middle east or say Turkey is very Western. Turkey is the remnants of a very indigeneous empire. It consisted of all kinds of people. for eg in the black sea region of Turkey there are the Laz people they have the laz language. There are the spanish jews, italians, kavkaz, chepni, turkmen, Rum. In Turkey they would ask which part you are from and ask your ancestry because we are not all Turks. Turkic people are spread out across asia and Eurasia. Turkey is different. People dont realise that.",

The issue of colorism is not limited to the east neither but also exist in Africa and Asia. It's sad Islam was suppose to remove this disease of superiority. The prophet warned us against this in his final speech. And It's definitely created division in the Muslim ummah, i see it as one of the diseases that holding us back from succeeding as an ummah.

In the Emevi empire there was a strong movement along non Arabs called shuubiyya and they were all non Arabs who are against the racism and slavery that is done. Search it. It's sad and even till now Arabs say that the movement was wrong when it wasn't. Also a lot of the non Arab Muslim scientists and authors in abbasi times were arabnised and even shamed and discriminated and called infidels for having different knowledge or religion (that is not told to anyone who doesn't dig in the history those people we know now as big were people who were wanted for their heads) and for having a mixed blood or for being completely from another race or writing about things that is not common to Arabs knowledge which Persians and Turks mastered. And even now they still make all the non Arab authors back in the \"Islamic history\" as Arabs with really smart way like adding \"al\" in the beginning of surnames as an example instead of well known khavarizmi they add alkavarzimi. Those people suffered a lot sadly the pressure was real. Islamic history isn't something to be proud of just like the times of dark ages Europe. And if people kept believing in what they do nothing will change which doesn't",

You're speaking English, Does that mean you're English ? See how silly you sound ? No, speaking a language doesn't make you an Arab, and the language you speak is a corrupt language, It's not the original Arabic, but that's another topic....Being  Arab means having Arab genes,  Do a DNA test and compare your DNA with the DNA of a Saudi or a Yemeni, You will see that their DNA is completely different from yours.  Arabs conquered Egypt , That's the reason you speak the language you speak, Your people were already in Egypt and they didn't speak Arabic. Egypt was a Christian Country and the Current Egyptian language was influenced by the Coptic language, The language of the Egyptian people. + There is not 22 Arab countries.  Hahaha Sad to see that so many Egyptians are brainwashed.  You could say Arabic speaking country , Not Arab, even saying Arabic speaking country would sound kind of weird because The language spoken in Algeria is not the same Language spoken In Iraq.

What I'm doing is simply waking up Egyptians and other colonized people of their delusion,  their mental slavery. I  have a Palestinian friend who fell in love with a Saudi woman and her family was totally against and racist, he told me how they saw him as inferior. Why would a black person claim to be white ? Wouldn't you think that that person has been brainwashed or has some internalized opression or shame of who they are ?   Egyptians should embrace who they are. I can tell you one thing:  As long as Wannabe Arabs like Egyptians keep bowing down to Arabs they will never be enlightened, Egypt will keep being a shithole and a backwards country. The culture of Egypt is not Arab and will never be. The current Egyptian culture has been infested by a cancer which is destroying Egypt and dividing it's people. Look at the Coptic Christians being  hunt down and killed,  to the ignorant fools in this comment section who are saying that I'm trying to define her identity :  what are you doing to the minorities in your country ? Which people are trying to impose their identity on others ?  Christians are being hunt down for being Christians so don't even start with that BS.   Why are people of color   so quick to march against European colonialism but when it comes to Arab colonialism nobody says a damn thing about it ?  You get what you deserve, The leader reflects the image of it's people,  You got Dictators like Sisi and Assad because you are not enlightened and not prepared to progress and development.  You worship Tyrants, you get tyrants. You live in total ignorance,  look at any middle eastern or north African country and ask yourself,  what went wrong  ? You know the answer.  Keep rejecting reality, worshipping Tyrants  and EMBRACING ARAB COLONIALISM , all you Wil achieve by doing that is your total destruction. By the way:  Tiran and Sanafir are Egyptian !!! Look how weak and pathetic the Egyptian gov't looked like giving it to Saudi Arabia, And the people have the audacity to complain about it when they themselves are Wannabe Arabs, That's what you get for being a Slave of Arabs. TIRAN AND SANAFIR - Egyptian-Coptic-African.",

In addition to politics  and Abdelnasser's \"pan-arab\" pipe dream.  You're literally talking to people who think speaking a language = ethnic, genetic identity.     There are many valid genetic tests and studies done on Egyptians that show they're significantly more genetically related to copts and their ancient Pharoa ancestors than to their neighboring Arab countries like the Gulf Arabs.  But unfortunately they're too far gone to even look at scientific studies. Are you half Amazigh BTW?",

I'm an Egyptian myself mixed with other 2 Arab countries that are not originally Arab as well. Well let me tell you that when we speak about Arabs we don't include ourselves and when you state this fact it doesn't trigger us. I'm a person who is really proud to not have even 1% Arab origins and if you consider us Arabs this doesn't flatter us because you're putting a 7 thousand + culture under the Arabian category. We surely all know that the pyramids were built by Egyptians not Arabs. This Arab superiority thing doesn't work on us we're the ones who don't want to be called Arabs not you who don't want us to be one of you. Oh and btw one of the reasons why \"you\" put us under this category is because of our military forces and we all know that if Egypt becomes independent again your countries will be nothing without us and our protection. The world knows Egypt for its culture not for being Arab. Have a nice day",

Qedarites, Majanites,Dilmunites,Sabaeans,Himyarites. \n\nSo literally there are NO  Arabs at all according to you \"identifying Arabs or not with DNA\" because Saudis ancient people were called Qedarites.

And simply we from the Arabian Peninsula can  say we are not Arabs because we werent Arabs in the first place we were many Semite tribes each called a different name like Qedarites in Saudi Arabia,  Sabaeans in Yemen , Majanites in Oman and Dilmunites in Bahrain or east Arabian peninsula. I dont know why some westerners say \"the only Arabs are from Arabian Peninsula\" when we(people of the Arabian Peninsula) too are descendants of our ancient people that weren't called Arabs, the Arab word came later in mid ninth century BCE. So if some autistic people think they are for example Phoenicians and Not Arabs therefore we too are Dilmunites and not Arabs. I hope you got my point",

Yes, Egypt has an ancient non Arab cultural heritage, no-one denied that. However, Arab culture has been a huge influence on Egypt for well over a thousand years, in addition to the many people that migrated to Egypt from the Levant and the Arab peninsula. In the modern political sense most Egyptians consider themselves Arab and are considered Arab in a broad sense on the world stage due to their close linguistic, geographical and cultural ties with the rest of the Arab world. This in no way means that Egyptians have given up, or were asked to give up their unique cultural identity as Egyptians. I get that you think you have made a very clear open and close argument, but in trying to substantiate a group's ethnic/cultural identity  by citing \"DNA tests\" you've only succeeded in sounding anachronistic.",

My mom was raised like this so for her it's not bad or anything and my sister got it from her and, thank god, i didn't. But like when i tell her she usually laughs and it pisses me off, cause i really try to make her see that it can be really offensive, she doesn't see it. She's bot a bad person tho, if she could see it she'd probably stop but how do i make her open her eyes ....",

Every Arab patient is referred to by their name but if it was a non-Arab then they are known as \"that Hindi guy\" or \"hada filibeeni\", etc and I can go so far as to say that they do not receive the same attention and care as the other Arab patients do. I could actually go on forever about this haha but I truly appreciate the fact that you shed some light on this, and there is actually someone out there other than me who wants to change this 😅You go Subhi!",

Like you said, people come up to me to ask something and then they realize that I'm not Saudi and go \"ohh anta hindi\" and then just walk away. Not everyone is like that but there are some who just think we are not one of them (as in we're Muslims too). I also face something similar in India because of my religion (a religion I'm grateful to be able to follow). But it's basically like we belong no where 😓 \nWait, I think I know where we belong!

My family and I left KSA over a decade ago to Canada for my career and it's a little embarrassing to admit that I've been treated better by the hostile non-Muslims here than by some of the Saudi natives back home. To be fair though, I've hardly acquainted myself with European Canadians in my time here since I live in Toronto, but on the off-chance that I have it's almost always a negative experience because I'm outwardly Muslim. Despite all this, I do miss life in Jeddah, the friends I made, the vibrant masjids, the overall friendly people, and the feeling of truly living under Islam. I cannot stress the final point enough, since living in the west inevitably corrupts your imaan. As evidence for this, the general Muslim population where I live are deep into riba and their brains have been hardwired to accept secular liberalism. If it were up to me, I would have never left KSA, even if it meant working a menial job. And if any of you are thinking of leaving your Islamic environment just because of a few bad encounters with non-practicing Muslims, by Allah, it's not worth it. Islam comes first.",

You don't speak for everyone. If you want to address your own personal experience then that's fine but don't make blanket statements. What about the racism and prejudice in south Asian communities towards others? That's more appropriate for you to talk about. Subhi is arab and is talking about what he has witnessed in the Arab community. It's not to open a discussion for a south Asian to attack Arabs. It can't be that bad if south Asians still flock to the middle east right? Also, the examples you give are not so much to do with race but rather with class. Maids are mistreated everywhere. How are south Asian doctors and engineers treated in the Middle East?",

We actually fought some Arabs, and to this day, a lot of Turks have not forgotten that. My father for example always brings that up. Funny things is, my whole friend group is Arab (like 95% Moroccan) haha. They love Turks and the Ottoman Empire, they stand by it. So yeah it is kind of a weird relationship. Then some Arabs do hate Turks too. But now it sounds like all Turks hate Arabs (which is not the case btw) there are lots of us who love them back.",

I am an Egyptian that grew up in the UAE, and there I've met and befriended people from all cultures whether Arab and non-Arab. Just looking back at it, makes me feel ashamed of how this sickening mentality has seeped through our minds without realising it. Arabs also are unfortunately racist not to the non-Arab only but to other Arabs as well. Of course I am not generalising but there is a problem.",

I know a lot of terrible Saudis (mostly they've been boys ahaha) but really they aren't that much, honestly. And Saudis especially are very nice to Sudanese people (I'm Sudanese), honestly they're one of the few Arab countries that have respect for us. I can happily say that I have never been wronged by them and my father also says in Sudanese, \"ma gasaru leyna\"! Yeah there are some racist ones but these ones are racist to Saudis that are dark-skinned as well, so I don't really care what they say. :)\nI have been mistaked for being Saudi and Indian though, and I can assure you the difference! This happened TWICE before, I'm looking outside the bus in the morning, this random Saudi guy rolls down the window and makes fun of me for being \"Indian\" by attempting to sing an Indian song. Some of the boys in my neighborhood tease and make fun of me whenever I hang out with my Indian friends 'cause they think I'm Indian as well, and when I talk Arabic back to them calling me names in Arabic they get all shocked.  \nbut tbh even some of my Indian friends have said racist things about Saudis because of how much they hate him.. both are at fault. :(",

In my country, Singapore, we're (alhamdulillah) quuuite united in terms of race, culture, religion etc. However, that doesn't mean racism doesn't exist. It is VERY MUCH alive, just that majority of the people here normalise this, which is so so sad because they think that racism is only exclusive to the US. SEE FOLKS THIS IS THE PROBLEM RIGHT HERE. I've personally received remarks from random strangers eg. \"wow you're in a university? You're smart for a Malay girl\" and \"you speak well for a Malay\". I've even heard things on the street (and whoa, the things people say are so upsetting). I try my best to politely call people out on this, but they take it as a joke like \"man, don't be so serious\", \"it's true right?\" and \"he/she also said this\". LMAO just because other people say this doesn't make it ok!!!! And you're right about the family/relatives thing - it's even harder to call them out on this because of our family tie and my respect for them. s i g h.",

Like other cultures will regard people in their culture as superior or better than them if they are more similar to arabs which is a shame. I feel like arabs and non-arabs both play a part in this superiority complex almost like non-arabs subconciously feel that arabs are superior and arabs pick up on that and it reaffirms it fot them. GUYS I DIDN'T EXPLAIN THIS PROPERLY. I AM SAYING THIS IS THE WAY IT CAN BE INTERPRETED BY ARABS THAT SOMETIMES CULUTURAL APPRECIATION CAN BE MISTAKEN FOR IMITATING THE CULTURE SO SOME ARABS FEEL AS IF NON-ARABS ARE TRYING TO BE LIKE THEM WHEN REALLY THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO FOLLOW THE WAY OF ALLAH (SWT)& THE PROPHET(PBUH). I hope you understand where i am coming from i don't think arabs are better than non-arabs at all.",

My father went to Dubai a few years back and the first thing he told me was how rude and inconsiderate most native arabs were not just to him but to all foreigners even on the damn airport. He said he never experienced that in any of travels to the US because no matter what they treat you politely. My sister lived in Saudi Arabia and she narrated the arrogance with which Saudis treat South Asian workers and it's beyond anything you can imagine. Pakistanis don't have a superiority complex that does not mean that every Pakistani will be inclusive of everyone but they don't treat you like shit the way some Arabs do. Your own comment proves that you lack basic manners on how to deal with criticism. There is colorism prevalent in most societies including Pakistan but people don't treat foreigners living in their communities as lesser humans as a norm. It actually was an Indian incident in which black Nigerians were attacked and beaten horribly in a mall this year not in Pakistan. We struggled for our own country so please don't pass those holier than thou snide remarks in our direction informing us how our country is less Islamic and it's inhabitants lesser humans.",

I'm not like that anymore alhumdullilah (cuz Asian eyes are attractive, and dark eyes against chocolate skin of African people are gorgeous and I love them)",

Usually its more covert and coded in other ways. As a fair skinned person you are less likely to pick up on it. Blonde girls being called shalabiya even though they are not pretty at all and overweight or grandmothers favoring the more european looking or blonde hair blue eyed kids over the kids who look more arab. Or denying of a marriage prospect for their son and there is nothing wrong with the girl shes just tanned and its blatant why it was rejected.

Even my mom says and believes that lighter skin is prettier. When my younger sister grew darker, my mom was upset and same for me. She always says how we were sooooo white when we were babies like it's a compliment. It's so sad it needs to stop. Why do we view blackness with such negativity. I remember watching a video where a girl said in her culture it would be much better if the baby was fat rather than dark and fatness is unhealthy.

European imperialism and colonization across the globe for centuries obviously has left countries with a menatlity that the more European you look the more attractive you are. It's not just in arab countries but everywhere.  In fact I'd say its worst in other asian countries like India or korea. But let me point out even before colonization societies viewed light skin as superior. If you were light skin you were most likely rich and didn't work in fields like their dark skin counter parts.

        "commentText": "Actually, Arabs prefer skin tones that are within a certain range. Too dark or too pale indicates that the person is not actually pure Arab. Not sure where this idea that we prefer pale skin and blue eyes is coming from. It is often questionable and referred to as mixed blood. The root of it comes from the fact that during the glory days of Arabs, slaves and concubines were brought in from Africa, Eastern Europe and Caucasian mountains. It is associated with most Arab’s minds that way. That’s why very dark and very light complexions are not favoured. Some Arab tribes are known to have gingers and in the greater Syria region ( Syria, Lebanon, Palestinian, Jordan and north western Iraq) we know what towns and villages have red hair and pale skin gene mutations. The obsession with pale skin and blue eyes comes from the same mentality of idolizing your colonizer. For Arabs that refers to\nThe ottomans. True Arabs genuinely dislike very pale skin and blue eyes because it is either associated with slavery and concubines or colonization. Dark skin is just like the rest of the world association with slavery. Avoiding the sun is mainly because when an Arab tans, most often it gets blotchy and uneven after few weeks. I personally grew up hearing “ too pale .. has no colour.. looks skinned.. has Asian features.. kinky haired.. big lips” as characters to dislike. All back to the same point, just like everyone, Arabs prefer what resembles them. Supreme? Not really.. it is simply not same values or look of who we are. Arabs are the kindest and most genuinely accepting of others. Just because we appreciate who and what we are does not mean we have supremacy complex. I believe that as Arabs we have always been defending who we are because other Muslims and neighboring nations resent us for a few hundred glory years that are long gone now.",

My dad is also light skin even though he is sudani, but he doesn't talk bad about people with dark skin because he was born in an African country. I just wish people in general could stop judging beauty by skin color.\n\n\nEdit:  You know actually Sudan is an Arab country because we speak Arabic as our first langue and we practice the Arab culture, of course we have our differences like every Arab country. Not all Arab countries are the same, but I still consider my self African mainly because people won't acknowledge the fact that im Arabic even though I speak the langue!",

Maybe your tribe is quite fair skin and other tribes not so. You can’t put a blanket statement that real Arabs have white or olive skin. There’s a Saudi Arabian man on IG name youngz and his skin is brown. It’s like cardi B complexion and he’s is Arab and he is Saudi! And he is darker skin! Why is it that when you go to Saudi Arabia the Arabs are A LOT DARKER! And that’s the place of the holy prophet SAW? So if anything you are giving a very limited narrow skewed mindset",

Yes I know that there are many Arabs who have  this type of behavior but I have also seen this with some of the Pakistanis so racism and arrogance exists in all races .  Can you imagine the Prophet PBH he was majestic and people would tremble in front him yet there was 100 % no  pride and arrogance in him so people should feel ashamed of themselves if they say \"I am\"\n\nI have seen Prophet Abraham ,Isa,Musa,and Nabi Khidr PBT one time  how I saw Nabi Ibrahim PBH was the following: I saw Sayyidina Ibrahim PBH with a face that was not completely round but slightly oval, upside v eye brows, v hairline and hair was a raven black and wavy and he had a aquiline nose bridge which was one flowing curve not a bump then a curve and not hooked neither jagged neither too big or too small . The curve started at root of nose  and was straight across at the nasal base  and he was  fair in color  and i saw him without a mustache just like how you see some muslim grow their beard everything about him was not too much and not too little.   The Prophet PBH said he resembled his forefather the most and he is truthful in his speech",

Nobody really looked at us like equals and i wasn't sure why. I heard my parents discussing how they judged us through our colour and inability to speak Arabic. The way even shopkeepers treated us was appalling. I've never understood it since we have been taught that we are all equal but coming from a part Arab I'm glad to know that I wasn't just hallucinating about the discrimination we faced.",

Especially in saudi when it's supposed to be the holiest and one of the most religious lands. I suppose racism exists in every culture though south-east asians are usually very racist towards black people but they look up to arabs a lot. I just think racism is a display of ignorance and miseducation or no education. I can definitely tell this is how the muslim community feels as a whole though",
