We older people saw what it started off as, a benign <b> common </b>trading market. But since 1992 it has become more and more dictatorial, issuing diktats from on high to<b>  nation</b> states very often not what we would want. It's not democracy, we're not allowed to control our borders and we have to pay over a fortune for no good reason.  But a young person will have been brainwashed by the educational establishment that the EU is something good that we should stay in.  I recommend young people should watc<b> h Brexi</b>t the Movie for a better understanding.  Once you've seen that you'll see why people voted to leave. It's basically turned into something that's no longer good for this country - that is, if it ever was.",

You demonstrate your ignorance and your weakness by thinking its perfectly OK to be intolerant of others and, when challenged, make a personal attack like 'you haven't done anything'.

I will not stand by and d<b> o nothin</b>g. As I didn't when I served my country for 15 years and went to war. You are a perfect example of why the young need protecting from themselves sometimes. Because as this man courageously pointed out: We have the life experience and you do not.\n\nI voted for Ted Heath in '72 and voted Remain in '75 when it was the EEC and just about Trade with 8 other similar countries. FoM was no issue as it was about 30,000 a year. I worked in Germany and knew Germans who worked here. No problem. Where it has gone wrong is the Socialists created the 'EU' and a political project to become a United States of Europe, our Governments were conned or (in Labour's case) connived with it and we were never asked to join the EU. It was foisted on an objecting population. And then in 2004 Labour failed the country completely by opening the floodgates in uncontrolled mass migration from an EU of now 27 other countries, 12 of whom were utterly poor <b> ex communi</b>st countries, 7 years earlier than anyone else to simply 'rub the Right's nose in diversity'! Bastards! And then invented 'Tax Credits' so that large companies could employ these thousands of migrants on low wages to increase profits! And we, our schools, our NHS and our housing have suffered the consequences ever since.\n\nYoung lady. When you have earned a few T Shirts, been around a few blocks and maybe got your soft hands dirty with hard graft then get back to us. Until then shove your Socialist, self righteous, sanctimonious and entitlement driven attitudes where the sun don't shine .....",

She had 12 years of schooling also paid for by the working mans taxes and she has the gall to tell these people they didn't know what they were doing on 23 June 2016. Cheeky madam, her parents should have taught her to respect her elders.",

I am much older than she. I am also much more worldly and much more informed and better educated than she is. I can also fathom out for myself that denying someone the right to a vote because a; they are not informed enough (although judging by her standards, I cannot imagine what\u00a0level she would set\u00a0this at), or b; they do not have enough time to live. This\u00a0\u00a0is one of the most singularly vile and\u00a0disgusting concepts that I have heard. Maybe she really does want to live in a totalitarian state. If people were to be disenfranchised, one of the first criteria for realignment would be the <b> age </b>of the voter. 18 is way too young; however, we have to start somewhere. It is interesting that the areas where a strong majority of the electorate vote Labour is amongst; those in full time education (students and full timefurther education drones) and the permanently unemployed. Both categories should have the right to vote removed from them.",

            "commentText": "The millenials think that the older generations have all maliciously and deliberately added debt to the national economy that they have to pay for. The baby boomers did benefit at a time in the past in a manner people today can not, and it is true that in many ways this has disenfranchised certain aspects of the youth population,  but the unexperienced, mal-educated (indoctrinated) uni kids of today have gone one step further and assumed that the generations before them have political apathy and aren't worth listening to, nor are they deserved of their lawful right of a political voice.\n\nThis is a shame, because experience defeats \"education\" everyday. There used to be a time where the majority of your teachers had previous work experience in their field, so you were at least getting second-hand experiences. Today, most teachers are \"career\" teachers; just as bad as politicians and touting their own brand of ideological waffle.\n\nThis scenario also has the added consequence that the millenials typically express bigotry towards anybody with more life experience: easily identifiable in a person on account of <b> age </b>ie. you can tell by looking at them they've been around longer, therefore the chances are he/she has more relative experiences than you. This dismissal is inherently unnatural of human beings; in most cultures the older and wiser, the more revered you are.\n\nInterestingly, and paradoxically, it is this way of indoctrinating students to whine on in lack of experience that has caused the teacher to lose control in the classroom in 21st century UK. They do not respect their elders as a default position.",

So it must be from the remain side itself who's only form of attack seems to be a poor effort to shame voters into changing their minds...Sorry but you cannot shame people who hold no shame, but who voted with a clear conscience against the UK's membership of a corrupt , non democratic organisation. Even if the EU was democratic, many would have still voted to leave, can the remain side not see that as the EU gains more centralised decision making , each countries citizens influence becomes more diluted... Eventually the role of a member states government will have no more power at decision making than your local/parish council....But that aside I personally voted to leave to empower the UK, to enable the economy to grow , to enable the UK begin positive trading within expanding economies, to enable the UK to become the<b>  nation</b> that set the standards in safety, build quality, building codes etc.. I realised that outside of the EU we are better able to react quickly to global changes rather than reaching half baked compromises due to the vestige interests of 27 other nations, a compromise that is only reached after endless months of inaction and pontificating.",

We had to go to the commonwealth because of labour shortages. ironcally it was the unions who objected to the immigrants.  They marched on parliament citing their jobs were at risk.

This can be achieved by successive steps, each disguised as having an economic purpose, but will eventually and irreversibly lead to federation.\"\nI'm no fan of the Tories OR Labour, but how is unlimited immigration going to give us more housing? How is unlimited immigration ever going to improve the lives of the least well off in society? You don't need to read economics for dummies to realise that a surplus of workers combined with a dearth of jobs will ALWAYS keep wages down. The <b> Black </b>Death of the fourteenth century freed the serfs and increased wages- the opposite will obviously DO the opposite.\nThe EU is not some benevolent organisation- it's ran by, and for the benefit of multinational businesses.

If the media had better converge of the leave side from both the left and the right, leave would have an even higher turnout for leave , this was done to fuel the media's pro eu agenda\nYou have to remember it was the left that wanted <b> brexit </b>in 1975 and I hate how the media has spun this into a totally right wing issue",

The Tory party has ripped up its manifesto in less than 30 days and you are attempting to argue a Labour party\u00b4s position held 40 years ago (which, by the way, was a deeply divided decision then as it is with the current day parties). \n\nThe fact is, the Tory party has been divided over this issue since 1992 and the  Maastricht Treaty and Cameron used the Ref as a way of managing the party and miscalculated the snakes (Rees-Mogg, Cash, Duncan-Smith, Redwood) who are a bunch of egomaniacs and right-wing ideologists who have betrayed their country by putting their selves before the <b> nation.</b>",

We must find a way to spread our message of Europe being a homeland for the native Europeans and not everyone in the world that wants to come here. We must persuade younger people with genuine concerns about identity, immigration and multiculturalism that their is a place for them in the alt right. Their are lots of different groups within the alt right but we are growing. We must challenge those on the left and expose them for the hypocrites they are. The memes and videos are just the start, we must spread our ideas through social media and attract attention even if it is bad, you know what they say, any publicity is better than no publicity. I have a lot of respect for the identitarians who tried to stop the boats of migrants from coming into Europe. I think more actions like that are needed to show people that yes we can make a different and we can change the way Europe is heading.",
