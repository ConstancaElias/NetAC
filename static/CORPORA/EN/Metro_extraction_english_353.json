        "postText": "\u2018You\u2019re different from the other Asians/Muslims,\u2019 or \u2018wow, you\u2019ve really broken the mold,\u2019 are just some of the things I\u2019ve had said to me by well-intentioned people.', 'Such statements are designed to praise the work you\u2019ve done for earning your place at the table, for going over and beyond what many, it seems, might have expected of you. You\u2019ve exceeded their expectations.', 'And what is it exactly that is expected of those of us \u2018who are different from others\u2019? What do you think the rest of us are like? It seems the default expectation of a son or daughter of immigrants, especially if they happen to be from a Muslim background, is not much at all.', 'We\u2019re likely to be trouble makers, suspect, lazy, sponging off the state, or within the same breath, taking all your jobs and being lazy \u2013 a contradiction I\u2019ve never quite understood.', 'So, when the outstanding Mo Salah of Liverpool Football Club was being praised for reducing hate crimes in Liverpool, it once again reminded me of the conversations I and so many other people of colour are used to having, about those of us who are classified as \u2018good immigrants\u2019 and those of us who are \u2018bad immigrants\u2019.', 'Take nothing away from Mo Salah, his performances not only as a footballer on the field as well as the way he conducts himself off the field make him a role model that many should rightly look up to. If it so happens that this has led to a fall in hate crimes against Muslims at a time when the far-right is rising across Europe, that too can only be considered a good thing.', 'But relying on how exceptional some of Muslims are, so that the rest of us \u2013 who are equally brilliant in our own way \u2013 can live a little easier, isn\u2019t the best way to tackle racism. It fills me with much unease to know that my worth and value as a human being will be determined by how brilliantly a footballer, or an athlete or a baker is performing so that Britain can get a positive view of the rest of us.', 'If Mo Salah performs badly, or dare I say it, even leaves Liverpool Football Club, will I then have to worry about my sisters and mother walking through Liverpool if they have a headscarf on?', 'What about the rest of us? The stay at home mother who is looking after her disabled son, or those who contribute taxes even though they\u2019re just getting by, aren\u2019t they exceptional and worthy of being treated equally, too?', 'Do we really need to be exceptional so that we aren\u2019t discriminated against? A question that doesn\u2019t just hold true for Muslims, but for all other minorities and women. Can\u2019t we be average, mediocre, boring and still think we have a right not to be discriminated against? For millions who face discrimination, are we saying it\u2019s OK just because they\u2019re not exceptional in our eyes.', 'The need for basic human dignity shouldn\u2019t have to be based on someone needing to be exceptional or even liked by you.', 'Attributing decreases in hate crime to one exceptional individual like Mo Salah also brings the added problem of ignoring the structural issues that give rise to anti-Muslim racism and hatred, allowing others off the hook.', 'Anti-Muslim racism \u2013 like Muslim charities being investigated without any cause for links to extremism \u2013 won\u2019t be solved by one exceptional individual.', 'I refuse to buy into the idea that my right to be treated as a human, to be considered an equal, is to aim for a bar that is set so high.', 'I\u2019m now at risk of sounding like the \u2018ungrateful\u2019 immigrant. It is always assumed that arguments like mine are borne out of anger or hatred for the country that has \u2018given me\u2019 so much opportunity.', 'Yet to apply James Baldwin\u2019s words on America to Britain, I love Britain more than any other country in the world, it\u2019s my home, I don\u2019t know any other country I could call home, and it is for this reason that I insist on the right to criticise it.', 'No one should have to be exceptional, just so they are not discriminated against.",

Are you really saying the all these people deserve everything that has happened to them because Politicians wished to depose Dictators in Iraq (Sadam) who murdered and terrorised his own people. Gaddafi in Libya, who  equally terrorised his people ( I know they did because I worked there and the ordinary people didn't live well and were afraid of saying anything in case someone heard and reported them) Afghanistan, the British fought the Russians there at the turn of the Century. The Russians fought there first of course. Did you know that? So when you say that the West invaded Muslim countries, name one that doesn't terrorise their citizens. There isn't one..",

You seem to dismiss the amount of destruction and people that have been killed in the name of Christianity by the West by failing to mention them at all. Secondly Iraq was better off with Saddam and everyone knows that except deluded Americans who are brainwashed into thinking that everything they touch turns into gold dust. And what you say about Libya is a complete utter lie. Libya where health care was free, education was free, where newly married couples would receive an amount etc Libya was one of the most prosperous <b> African </b>nations that had the potential to be an economic force. Oh and your final point regarding the Brits fighting Russia ; which side did the Brits take and arm? Oh yeah the Taliban",
