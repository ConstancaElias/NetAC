        "postText": "As a secondary school teacher I\u2019ve sat through \u2013 and led \u2013 countless assemblies. But at the end of this school year I led the assembly of my life.', 'Along with a fellow teacher, I came out to our entire school.', 'Some of the students knew I was gay \u2013 I co-run a weekly LGBT+ group at the school \u2013 and I suspect some of them had perhaps guessed. But for the majority of them, my sexuality wasn\u2019t something they knew about.', 'But that changed one day a couple of weeks ago when a colleague came to me and told me a sad story. He\u2019d been talking to a year 10 student about some other kids who had recently come out as bisexual.', 'The student said he felt they\u2019d been attention seeking. My colleague, Luke, came out as gay to the student, and explained a bit about the coming out process.', 'When Luke told me this, I shared some stories of homophobic language I\u2019d heard around school. He suggested doing an assembly for the year 10 students, and once we asked senior staff if this was OK, the plan quickly escalated to assemblies for the whole school.', 'The kind of things we hear that we\u2019re trying to eradicate are comments like \u2018that\u2019s so gay\u2019 or \u2018Snapchat is gay!\u2019. We hear them all the time. Could we really help stop this habit for good?', 'So what\u2019s so different about this assembly? Well, just 15 years ago, doing what I did would have been illegal under Section 28. That act was passed in 1988 and essentially stopped schools from \u2018promoting\u2019 homosexuality. My assembly could have landed me in prison.', 'Repealed in 2003, Section 28 covered the first five years I was at school. There we had a teacher who spoke about being gay \u2013 he was breaking the law. Now the law has changed I feel privileged I\u2019m able to speak so freely.', 'I come out to someone every day in one way or another. It can be super awkward. Sometimes I\u2019m forced out. This way, with the assembly, I was going to reach out to students and do something for myself, too.', 'A few students told me they had no idea I was gay and I loved that, because it showed that although my classroom is covered in Stonewall posters they haven\u2019t made an assumption, which is lovely.', 'It was daunting, but the risk felt worth any stress I felt.', 'We wrote an assembly that could be delivered to each year group across the course of a week, before the end of the summer term.', 'Before each assembly Luke and I would have a huddle, feeling terrified. Nothing could have prepared me for the moment we stepped on stage.', 'Of course, there was definitely a bit of me that worried that I might have to have difficult conversations with kids who might say they didn\u2019t agree with what we were doing. But it didn\u2019t happen.', 'A few students told me they had no idea I was gay and I loved that, because it showed that although my classroom is covered in Stonewall posters they haven\u2019t made an assumption, which is lovely.', 'Our school is going for a rainbow flag award and this will count towards it. I can\u2019t describe how proud I am. And now I\u2019ve spoken about it on national TV, too. So I guess I\u2019m out to the entire world!', 'Still, Section 28 has left countless teachers wary of the backlash of coming out. I hope I\u2019ve showed that it\u2019s possible and it can be a positive thing. This was as much for teachers as for the kids.', 'It\u2019s not just about coming out as gay \u2013 the trans element is huge, too. It\u2019s a much more obvious thing to decide.', 'Coming out as trans is much more difficult than as gay and I would like to think students will feel now they might be more comfortable doing that.', 'Of course we worried there\u2019d be negative feedback but I can honestly say there hasn\u2019t been any. The response has been overwhelming.', 'Students have been coming out to us, telling us their stories and generally expressing huge positivity towards the LGBT community as a whole. It\u2019s brought the whole school together and that\u2019s the best reward of all for taking such a risk.', 'It\u2019s all well and good talking about Drag Race stars, and Ellen, Tom Daley and Laverne Cox, but what our students need are role models they see every day and know face to face as real people.', 'I hope I\u2019ve shown myself to be one of them.",
