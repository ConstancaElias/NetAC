If you want to condemn all whites for anything bad ANY european ever did in the past, let's also look at accomplishments from white people.

Among many, many others....\r\n\r\n-ONE SINGLE European save over 250 million lives.  The smallpox vaccine was invented by a WHITE man.  You want to whine about non euro dead as a result of colonialism, slavery, etc.  Let's also talk about the other side.....lives that have been saved and improved by the inventions of Europeans.  Fair is fair after all.\r\nWHITES INVENTED:\r\n-the automobile\r\n-the airplane\r\n-the jet engine\r\n-the computer\r\n-the MRI\r\n-the CT scan\r\n-radar\r\n-sonar\r\n-the helicopter\r\n-the internet\r\n-the telephone\r\n-harnessed electricity\r\n-many water purification methods that saved 10's of millions\r\n-medical inventions, vaccines, etc that have saved hundreds of millions\r\n\nWhites have saved many, many more lives than they have taken.  \n\nMost blacks in america have no clue about the truth of slavery.

I have able0body privilege because I am healthy and am not wheel chair bound.  If someone points out this privilege, it does not mean they hate me lol.  All White privilege means is that Whites in America benefit from being the racial majority.

Who is, or will be, counted as a son of God, is determined by whether or not His Word abides in them, or not.

Some strive to know Him, and are chosen, brought near, whilst others are chosen, and so strive to know Him. .. I have never forgiveness for what are called racists, but ought to be called eugenicists, so as not to confuse them with athletes who compete in races. They may say to defend their actions on the day of judgement that they thought the bible told them to be eugenicists - but misinterpreting scripture is not a valid excuse. A wicked man may look to scripture for a hope of salvation, but if the correct interpretation is withheld from him, it simply means that he is doomed, unable to discover how to love others, to do good, and not evil.",

Why don't we all just do what we can in our communities to make life equal for everyone? That's all we can do. By putting out videos that vilify people of any color, it changes the perception of others on that color. It enhances animosity. We should be enforcing love and acceptance, not picking one <b> race </b>to place all the blame. I am of mixed<b>  race</b>....People of both my descendants races, I don't belong. But in most eyes, I am human and accepted. By vilifying on<b> e rac</b>e, it just enhances hate. So how about we all accept that there are some huge changes that need to be made and focus on those changes instead of blaming everyone of a certain color. It's silly. This is how violence and hate breeds. We don't need this, the media does enough of this. We should love each other I don't understand videos like this.... The disparity is known, I'd like to instead hear about what people are doing to make things better rather than encouraging the hate a<b> nd raci</b>sm. :( I cry for our inability to love each other all the same. People of ev<b> ery r</b>ace can get lost in our differences rather than embrace them, we can try to change them, but it's likely unsuccessful. That is why our voices of unity and equality must scream louder than their voices of hate. We need to unite, of all colors, not divide,like this video encourages.",

They and their children will survive, and they will return.\n\nZephaniah 3:19 And I will deal severely with all who have oppressed you.

I will give glory and fame to my former exiles, wherever they have been mocked and shamed.\n\nAmerica and all nations are doomed, because our Heavenly Father has said that he would spread his children among ALL nations then bring an end to those nations..

Anyone who has volunteered at a charity or thought they would change the world teaching inner city blacks can tell you th<b> e blac</b>k community is damaged.

I had my blood tests taken by a nurse and she called the other nurse because i needed some tablets. The other nurse came in looked at the results, spoke very loudly to me and told me that I needed urgent medication and if my result got any lower i would have to take a blood tranfusion. Obviously, with all of this information being processed I looked at her in shock and disbelief.\"Do you inderstand English?\" Is what she said to me, in a very patronising tone of voice.  I responded by saying \"Of course, I do\" \nTurns out the doctor told me it wasnt even that low, I just needed to boost it up a bit and he reassured me in a calming tone of voice. After that I told him about what had happened and he said that he will speak to her. I'm glad i complained.",

In my school, 95% of the time when somebody causes trouble, bullies, starts a fight etc. immigrants got something to do with the situation. Usually fully but sometimes they are just involved. I understand why people have these thoughts on people who have a differen<b> t rac</b>e. I have many friends who come from middle-east and they are very nice people. But the problem is, you cant tell just by looking at people are they an asshole or a decent guy. Thats why people have prejudices.",

To be truly brave is to speak the truth with an unbiased lens. Today, if you see actual discrimination done by anyone in the government or in a business, we have laws to protect and diminish the advancement of people such as this. Today, however, there is an epidemic spreading with the use of social media. One of the major issues is something called \"confirmation bias\" it means you seek information to match what you believe and ignore what doesnt match your beliefs. I accuse you of doing this.",

So  maybe they should randomly take REAL peoples names of eithe<b> r blac</b>k or white skinned people and then measure the results.  That's how you scientifically test something.",

                    "commentText": "@Dennis Walker Explain the privilege? Here's the thing, no other racial group in the US has experienced such institutional discrimination like the Native Americans and blacks for almost the entirety of this country's existence. Because of that, Native Americans and blacks suffer from disadvantages set forth by previous generations. Things are getting better now, but, I'll give you one example, it's anecdotal but it's one example, I'm a pilot, soon to be an airline pilot. The first <b> black </b>airline pilot wasn't until 1964. Even to this day, in America, there are only less than 2%<b>  black</b> pilots, even less for women pilots.  Now, last February, I was blasted by someone saying that it's people like myself (blacks) and women, as the reason why white men like himself couldn't get an airline job in the 1980s...\n\nEven though he has had the OPPORTUNITY since the beginning of aviation...  Blacks and others minorities have only had the opportunities for a few decades, as opposed to everyone else.  Which goes to a bigger institutional point. Yes, personal responsibility is very important, but it's rather ignorant to deny that some individuals due to institutional oppression that has lasted up until the last 50 years, didn't have affect on these said group's ability to succeed and excel.  There's still reports of racial bias in several locations throughout the country that disproportionately target people of color over others.  It's hard to move forward, when you have people still trying to hold you back.",

Yeah it happened , yeah it was bad , but get over it and quit blaming every white for the transgressions of 5% , that is very very childish .Quit making excuses , graduate high school,  get a job and do not have children out of wedlock.

With no father in the home , children are 5 times as likely to quit school , and 20 times more likely to go to prison . So unt<b> il bla</b>ck culture changes to where these practices are condemned instead of being the norm , it will not matter what anyone does , it will not accomplish anything .I would add one more requirement, if you can not afford to have children without government assistance, don't have them.",

And seeing the <b> racist </b>behavior of<b>  black</b> lives matter , and the bias against all police blm promotes  , the traitor Obama and hi<b> s rac</b>e baiting administration pushing false narratives , and people's willingness to assume guilt or racial bias despite mathematical statistics proving otherwise , I am inclined to believe the jury or judge presiding over the case . From what I have been able to find out about the case , despite the tragedy it was , Tamir Rice's parents , we're as much to blame as anyone . So if you have any facts about this case not available to me , share them and let's dicuss them . But understand that beliefs are not facts .",

This is all the two officers had to go on when they arrived on scene . The dispatcher fails to mention that the caller thought it was a bb gun 1st mistake . The police car pulls up to the gazebo and the officer exits the police car with his weapon drawn . Standard procedure for this situation . Regardless of whether the officers said it once or three times , anyone taught to comply with the police would drop the weapon . 2nd and most grievous mistake made by Tamir Rice . What everyone refuses to even consider is Tamir's parents complete failure to perform the basic requirements of parenting . First there is no such thing as a toy gun . Second removing every part that identifies it as a toy . Third not teaching basic gun handling procedure . Fourth allowing him out with a gun . Fifth failure to teach Tamir that you never point a weapon at anyone except in self defense . Sixth , failure to teach compliance with the police . So I can see firing the dispatcher , but the entire rest of the responsibility is on Tamir's parents . They should be locked up for endangering the life of a minor and negligent homicide for their sons death . Their failure as responsible parents was the only reason their son died .",

They could have just given th<b> e blac</b>k resumes to harder to obtain jobs when compared to the white resumes. They don't specify that they were given to the same employer, and if they did give to the same employer then the employer would have noticed it. Bad experiment integrity.\n2. Nowhere do they state that the same car is bought, or that the same dealer was used, or that the car was paid in full vs paid over time with interest accrued. Trash correlations.\n3. Of cour<b> se bla</b>ck drivers are more likely to be pulled over, and here is why. First of all, think about what type of neighborhood you would most likely fin<b> d a bl</b>ack driver. that's right, poor neighborhoods and that is also where crime happens the most. So logically you would find more pull overs near poor neighborhoods, and they just happen t<b> o be b</b>lack. confounding variables everywhere.\n4. Remembe<b> r #3, </b>black people are poorer (its not their fault, its just a result of recovery from slavery+unfairlaws that takes time to heal). So they would immediately have less options based on their budget. It is never stated that the clients studied had the same budget rang<b> es.\n5.</b> Black people would be more likely arrested for weed because they are more likely to be pulled over or questioned because of the reasons I stated on #3. again, invalid correlation\n6.poor people are jailed more, that's known, again its not their fault blah blah blah.\n7. Better health care comes from more money, that easily explains that. again t<b> he sam</b>e black people are poorer scen<b> ario.\n</b>8. Black people would be less likely to contact WHITE legislators, this one is really easy to see the flaw in. \n\nThis entire study is basically saying, \"poor people get less benefits, what a surprise right?\" it just happens to be that<b>  a lot</b> of black people are poor, to solve this you don't go around making videos telling p<b> eople t</b>hat racism exists. To help in the cause you try to improve the USA economy so that poverty levels are reduced on all fronts.",

You've already convinced the people who agree with you, but using one-sided arguments isn't going to convince people who don't. Presenting the whole argument of  each topic with a brief synopsis, and acknowledging the other talking points while still emphasizing what can't be explained by anything other tha<b> n rac</b>e is what's going to convince rational people. Irrational people won't be convinced regardless. Sometimes people just have never had the full facts and statistics clearly presented to them and it's all they needed, but incomplete arguments aren't going to do that. Anyways just my thoughts.",

It is the notion of ascribing moral, social or political significance to a man's genetic lineage\u2014the notion that a man's intellectual and characterological traits are produced and transmitted by his internal body chemistry. Which means, in practice, that a man is to be judged, not by his own character and actions, but by the characters and actions of a collective of ancestors.\n<b> Racism </b>claims that the content of a man's mind (not his cognitive apparatus, but its\u00a0content) is inherited; that a man's convictions, values and character are determined before he is born, by physical factors beyond his control. This is the caveman's version of the doctrine of innate ideas\u2014or of inherited knowledge\u2014which has been thoroughly refuted by philosophy and science.<b>  Racism</b> is a doctrine of, by and for brutes. It is a barnyard or stock-farm version of collectivism, appropriate to a mentality that differentiates between various breeds of animals, but not between animals and men.Like every form of determinism<b> , racis</b>m invalidates the specific attribute which distinguishes man from all other living species: his rational facult<b> y. Raci</b>sm negates two aspects of man's life: reason and choice, or mind and morality, replacing them with chemical predestination. -Ayn Rand",

Since this is not taking place and America is now a land of mixed races their is violence and disrespect everywhere ! Individuality is out the window . I have no doubt that America will probably soon be totally destroyed ! Who wants this ? It is the super - rich plutocracy that wants this ! It has always been the super - rich who have wanted monopoly and dictatorship ! It has always been the super - rich that have wanted to totally destroy the United States of America ! The truth is the super - rich love liberalism and the super - rich have now gained total control over both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party ! Unless this is thwarted very soon and I do mean very soon America is going to become a land of TOTAL DICTATORSHIP ! Best Wishes -- Joseph Stefurak",

I remember just last year going to look at a home in a neighborhood that was predominatel<b> y blac</b>k, no problem with that here, but the part about it that put me off was when everyone\u00a0that was out in their front yards turned and stared at me driving by like I was in the wrong neighborhood. Also remember a time that my mother had gone to a mall and overheard o<b> ne bla</b<b> >ck wo</b>man saying to another, \"What is that white bitch doing here\".

So if there is something that someone has not accomplished in their life it's not the fault of someone else, it's that individuals fault for not pursuing their goals of a better life. \u00a0 The thing that bothers me the most is so many people play into the hype of the media that continually helps in the false propaganda of \"Oh this group and that group are being held back\". It's time that every individual stop playing the poor me card and grow up and start taking accountability for themselves.",

I don't even follow the media or news stations, but whenever I hear anything pertaining to <b> racism </b>its that, not that<b>  black</b> people are being held back. People think tha<b> t blac</b>k people just see this stuff on tv or just need something to complain about, but you have to stop and think is at least some of it tru<b> e. Bla</b>ck people having it harder is something I've seen, I don't think it's an excuse to give up and bec<b> ome noth</b>ing, that's half the races problem, they don't see a reason to try. It's harder for them to move up the workplace totem pole and even sometimes get paid as much as others, for example my mom has tons of experience from many different workplaces, and they were going to recieve raises for ones who have a lot of specks, but she only got raised 25 cent and a young Caucasian girl that just came in and is actually ranked lower than my mom is getting paid more than her and she has nowhere near as much experience nor is her job as important as my moms. My brothers job got new management that fired him without giving him an appropriate reason and all of the o<b> ther b</b>lack people there, now there's only white people working that job. Someone I know got taken off of disability and they told her to go work, but she was only 96 pounds and couldn't handle it even though she tried and she died because of that. My step dad was told by a doctor that he cannot work because of his lupus, but disability still denies him, so he has to work and every job he gets, he gets sick and loses that job for not being able to stay on it. My point is it exists, maybe not in your life, you don't have to be subjected to see it, and I agree only that its not a reason to give up.",

This is not an example that is <b> race </b>specific,\u00a0new employees at\u00a0many companies generally tend to start at a higher salary than long term employees, it's usually part of the negotiations that\u00a0 occur during that person's\u00a0talks as to whether or not they will accept employment with the employer. I have seen a lot of new employees start with more money where I work and they are incapable of performing their jobs as well as I perform mine. The example that you provided of your brother's termination due to a new manager is also not<b>  race</b> specific. Many times when a company\u00a0brings in new management, that management comes in with new views as to how things should be done and many times that comes with the decision to tear down the department and rebuild with\u00a0new\u00a0or fewer employees.\u00a0The other examples that you provided of a sick friend being forced to work and your step dad who has lupus and can't get disability are also not examples o<b> f racis</b>m, this happens to white people as well. A\u00a0white co-worker of mine a few years ago was diagnosed with\u00a0Lou Garrets disease and due to her illness was not able to work most of the time,\u00a0she was terminated. Another white co-worker of mine had\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis and suffered crippling pain on a daily basis, she missed a few days a week due to her illness and was terminated. \u00a0My point is that before we can deem something <b> as raci</b>sm, we have to look at the whole picture not just what we choose to see and hear. D<b> oes rac</b>ism exist? Yes it does. It exists in e<b> very </b>race that walks this earth. What do we do about it? Our first step is to stop associating with people who label others based on the color of their skin. Our second step is that we stop giving into those that constantly cry wolf.",

A degree typically doesn't mean that you are more intelligent than another person. It only means that you spent the time in the courses and passed them at a satisfactory level, and even that isn't a guarantee that all people with a degree deserved to receive it, but they did and still do, thanks to a little practice in college called the bell curve. If you think it's hard for an Asian to get into a \"top notch\" college, try growing up a poor Caucasian who can't afford it and all the attempts at any grants are denied because everything that they have left are funds that are set aside for \"minorities\".",

Prime example: the video \"depicted\" a supposed difference between two racial backgrounds being financed for a vehicle and claimed that on average blacks were more likely to pay a higher interest rate than whites. If you think about that claim logically you have to consider the obvious question. Why are they paying higher interest rates? Are dealerships and financial institutions\u00a0all across the <b> nation </b<b> >racist</b>? Highly unlikely. Or is it the simple fact that on average a person of color is less likely to negotiate the terms of the loan and not willing to walk away from the dealership and take their business elsewhere? Dealerships and financial institutes around the world are more than willing to take advantage of anyone willing to take a high interest loan. Is i<b> t racis</b>m? No!\u00a0 So instead of crying wolf every time\u00a0the neighbors Chihuahua barks, how about we all save the real cry for help for when the wolf actually shows up?",

Although the SD 'is commonly given \u2026 as 15' for everyone (Herrnstein, 1994, p. 276), <b> the bl</b>ack SD for the data used in Figure 14-5 was 12.4. According to Jensen, the SD for whites is 16 (18 for males and 14 for females) but is 10 or 11 (some say 14) for NE Asians and about 12 for blacks. 45 A group that has a larger SD will have both more geniuses and more dummies than another group that has the same mean but a smaller SD; white males have the largest SD, which may explain their greater achievements (see next chapter).\"\n\n- proudly? \u00a0i didn't sense that, but u did? \u00a0u have some amazing cyber mind reading skills? \u00a0and continue on this childish need of wishing i was this dummie u want to debate - good luck with that...\u00a0\n\ni scored 92% on the science section of our ACT, did u? \u00a0 or maybe your 8<b> 4 IQ na</b>tion doesn't have such high level tests for Ivy League and such... \u00a0were u a bio major like me?\n\niqtest.com \u00a0take the test, lets compare results... did u graduate with honors? \u00a0did u beat 96% of entering juniors in college in math? \u00a0did u ace your last college math class? \u00a0\n\ni'm on the fast sloping downward right side of the bell curve, but u of course are flat lining, right? \u00a0mensa or better? \u00a0u in that top 2% grouping? \u00a0\n\n- the way i write? \u00a0my own fast hack style with some efficiencies built in... its MARGIN, i wouldn't make that mistake, unless typing fast enough...\n\nhere is some schooling for<b>  u, a r</b>acist primer u need:\n\n [LINK] \n\n- u can get a free abridged version, which is how i got mine...

            "commentText": "Only white people can be Racists because of Systematic White Supremacy and where it is originally rooted from not that delusional dictionary that white folks use to deflect from the real definition of <b> racism.</b> Let me explain:\n\n'There is an element of whites who are<b>  nothing</b> but cold, animalistic racists. That element is the one that controls or has strong influence in the power structure. It uses the press skillfully to feed statistics to the public to make it appear that the rate of crime in th<b> e Blac</b>k community, or community of nonwhite people, is at such a high level. It gives the impression or the image that everyone in that community is criminal.'\n\u2013 Malcolm X, speech at the London School of Economics on Feb. 11, 196<b> 5\n\nBla</b>ck people cannot<b>  be rac</b>ist. We could possibly be prejudice, but the power dynamics of the system of white supremacy proves <b> that B</b>lack people do not have the ability to oppress other races. Malcolm teaches<b>  that r</b>acism uses a system to oppress and hold power over a person based on<b>  thei</b>r race.\n\n'In A<b> merica,</b> racism exists but racists are all gone. Racists belong to the past. Racists are the thin-lipped mean white people in the movies about the civil rights era. Here's the thing: the manifest<b> ation o</b>f racism has changed but the language has not. So if you haven't lynched somebody then you can't be<b>  called</b> a racist. If you're not a bloodsucking monster, then you can't b<b> e calle</b>d a racist. Somebody has to be able to say that racists are not monsters.'\n-Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Americanah\n\nAdichie cleverly states that 'racists belong to the past' because 2<b> 1st cen</b>tury racism has evolved into a monster that appears to be nonexistent or undetectable.  When white people are able to sit in the sa<b> me roo</b>m with Black people without calling them 'n*ggers' then i<b> n the w</b>orld's racist view that is progress.  The truth is that racists still exist, but they are able to hide behind so many things just<b>  not to</b> appear racist.\n\nBut this is what many ignorant white folks will try to do when it comes <b> to the </b>topic of racism:<b> \n\nTry t</b>o Ex<b> plain </b>Racism to a Black Person...smh\n\nMany white people will be quick to refer to Webster's dictionary for a simplif<b> ied exp</b>lanation of racism in an attempt to blatantly ignore the fact that racial prejudices have to be coupled with the ability to oppress a certain community in ord<b> er to b</b>e considered racism. The dictionary, obviously, provides an oversimplified<b>  explan</b>ation of what racism really is and, therefore, that definition should be the last thing white people reach for when they find themselves knee-deep in<b>  a conv</b>ersation about racism in America.\n\nOr this is another thing white folks will say as well:\n\nClaim the Real Pr<b> oblem</b> Is Class and Not <b> Race...ag</b>ain smh\n\nWhile classism is certainly a serious issue in America, it isn't one that should take<b>  away f</b>rom the fact that<b>  racism</b> still plagues the nation and deserves to be at the forefront of national discussions. Even more important is the fact t<b> hat peopl</b>e n<b> eed to </b>realize classism and racism are more connected than some white people bel<b> ieve. T</b>he negative impact of racism has <b> worked</b> for centuries to leave Black people in poverty. So, more often than not, those low-income communities are also the communities with the highest population of people of color.\n\nAnd this is one of the main stuff ignorant white people specifically w<b> ill say</b>: \n\nClaim They Can't Be Racist Because They're \u2018Colorblind'...smh..smh\n\nBeing 'colorblind' is a problematic claim in and of itself because it negates the cultural values, norms, expectations and life experiences of people of color. S<b> ociety </b>should not try to combat racism by<b>  maki</b>ng ill attempts at ignoring race. I<b> nstea</b>d, people should acknowledge race and celebrate those cultural differences. If society continues to hide behind a 'co<b> lorblin</b>d' veil, the true issues of racism that plague the country will never truly be resolved.",

Here are some highlights:\n\nThe median wealth gap difference between a White family and<b>  a Bla</b>ck family is $80,000.\n1 i<b> n 9 Bl</b>ack children has an incarcerated parent compared to 1 in 57 White children.\nA White man who has been to jail still more likely to get a job th<b> an a B</b>lack man who hasn't.\n\nAlso take a look at t<b> his...</b>Black people are the most vulnerable cogs in the wheel, and remain in a permanent state of crisi<b> s. \u00a0If</b> Black people remain vulnerable, no one in America's so-called democracy is safe. \u00a0The problem is institutio<b> nalized</b> racism, in a country which fails to acknowledge there is a crisis. \u00a0And yet, another study on a major American city sounds the alarm on the barrier<b> s faci</b>ng Black people. This <b> time i</b>t's Black men in Pittsburgh.\nThe study from the Urban Institute is titled, 'Barriers & Bridges: An Action Plan for Overcoming Obstacles and Unlocking Opportu<b> nities f</b>or African American Men in Pittsburgh.' \u00a0The 67-page report found that in the post-industrial economy in which Pittsburgh is thriving, based particularly on a shift from manufacturing to finance and health services, hiring practices that shut out people of colo<b> r have</b> kept Black men from economic opportunity.\n\nThe Urban Institute Report focuses primarily on documenting the racial dispari<b> ties b</b>etween Black and white men in their access to jobs, financial services, and business development opportunities. It also identified structural barriers in the form of policies, practices, and norms that help maintain racial gaps.\n'Though economic disadvantage befalls people of all races an<b> d ages, </b>young African American men have borne a disproportionate share of the burden of Pittsburgh's economic change,' the report's authors wrote. 'Although never fully equal, the well-paying manufacturing <b> jobs tha</b>t many African American men were able to secure with only a high school diploma (or sometimes less education) have virtually disappeared, leaving many men with few alternatives for adequately supporting a family.'\n\nAccording to the study, city leaders realize the need to change the way Pittsburgh does business, which contributes to the considerable racial disparities. \u00a0The city wants to attract more employers and industries, and suffers from a 'mid-level skills gap,' in which employees have been on the job for either 40 or more years, or less than five years. \u00a0Further, the city's interest in racial inclusion is driven by younger workers, who want to live in places that reflect Ameri<b> ca's ra</b>cial and ethnic diversity.\n\nIntergenerational mobility was identified as a factor leading to racial exclusion, as<b>  unions </b>kept out African-American<b>  worke</b>rs, leaving Black children lacking in the resources their white peers receive to acquire the skills the new w<b> orkfor</b>ce demands. \u00a0Black men in particular, have suffered from structural barriers, including current institutional practices, geographic segregation, social isolation from critical networks, and economic and other accumulated disadvantages resulting from a lack of access to employment, education, and other opportunities.\nIn Pittsburgh, the consequences of these b<b> arriers </b>are clear. \u00a0African-American men are 11.4 percent of men ages 18 to 64 in the Pittsburgh region, yet they are a mere 5.4 percent of the region's adult male workforce. \u00a0The report also found that in <b> many k</b>ey industries, Black workers find themselves at the bottom of the pay scale. \u00a0Moreover, the report not<b> es that </b>'Pittsburgh's African American men have historically and disproportionately faced unprecedented barriers to economic opportunities' among people liv<b> ing in</b> the region. For Black men with at least a high school diploma, the unemployment rate between 2007 and 2011 was 12.2 percent, more than double that of whites (5.1 <b> percen</b>t). \u00a0In addition, Black men are far more likely to live at or below the poverty level.\n\n'Structural barriers such as the expense of job training programs, online job applications (for men without easy access to a computer), and insufficient financial collateral to qualify for a business loan are very real for men who disproportionately struggle to make ends meet,' the report noted.\n'You have people who are disproportionately touched by the criminal justice system \u2014 sometimes unfairly \u2014 and they are disproportionately excluded from health care and other security-sensitive sectors,' Urban Institute fellow Margaret Simms told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\n\nSimms called the city 'one of the most segregated metropolitan communities in the country,' split along historical racial divides that still shape neighborhoods, the workforce and professional and social networks.\nThis latest study is but one of numerous reports that chronicle the<b>  impact</b> of institutional ra<b> cism on </b>the well-being of African-Americans. \u00a0For example, a recent study found that in Bal<b> timore</b>, banks are cheating Black people out of m<b> ortga</b>ges based primarily on race rather than income. \u00a0Companies use the court system to pursue c<b> ollect</b>ion lawsuits to target Black communities and squeeze them <b> finan</b>cially. \u00a0Further, due to<b>  race-</b>based predatory lending, Black homeowners lost wealth as whites gained wealth, cutting them out of the so-called American Dream. \u00a0The police financially exploit communities of color, as one Oklahoma study found that Blacks and other minorities accounted for two-thirds of the cash seizures by law enforcement.\nIn addition, the racial disparities in health care are evident, as Blacks and Latinos receive lower quality care and are made to wai<b> t long</b>er to see the doctor, and Black children are less likely to receive crucial pain medication than whites in the emergency room.\n\nThe studies are endless, all with similarly disappointing and alarming findings. \u00a0The reports will continue to mount if America fails to address the fundamentals of systemic racial discrimination, and seek to eradicate them immediately.",

The amount of <b> black </b>slaves brough too Canada is believed to he in the hundreds. Not only that but they where brough to Canada from the united states. As no shiploads of human chattel ever came to Canada. If you are gonna do research dont cherry pick what you use to provw tour point. The slave trade in Canada was no different from the slave teade in Africa. Warring tribes of indigenous people, took slaves from tribes the where at war with. So you can take your, \"all whitw folks benifit from slavery and shove it up your ass.",

So again Most slaves were imported from other British colonies and the Americas.\n\nSlave trade that white folks created was based on skin color, superiority and inferiority! They treated their slaves inhumanely or like animals just because of their white supremacists ideology over people who were<b>  black</b> that look different from them!\n\nNow every country all across the globe throughout history had slavery of some sort where warrior tribes took enemy tribe warriors and made them prisoners of war. But the thing was it wasn't based on skin color! It was based on enemy tribes going to war with each other which can be dated back to the beginning of time!\u00a0\n\nWhite folks made slavery about you ar<b> e blac</b>k so you are inferior and you will be treated like an animal or worse then a animal. Some of the africans back in Africa had no idea what was going on when the white folks put those captured Africans through the slave ports and then on the slave boats and then on the slave plantations. They had no idea the inhumane treatment white folks would bring upon their own people!",

The fact of the matter is, you don't know<b>  the B</b>lack experience in America because you'r<b> e not </b>Black, therefore you can't tell Blacks how to solve the problems <b> in the</b> Black community because you have no accurate depiction of what the problems even are, considering you don't live through them. It's the equivalent of an Obstetrician trying to tell a Plastic Surgeon how to do a Rhinoplasty.\n\nAnd to stress my point even further, there's a cliche that is tried and true, and it states, \"don't judge a man until you've walked a mile in his shoes\".....Let me be very fucking clear with you when I say this.\n\nYou have never, and will never, w<b> alk the </b>African American walk, so you can never, and will never be able to accurately judge what the fuck is going o<b> n in t</b>he Black community.\n\nI'm sorry if your self-<b> right</b>eou<b> s race and n</b>ationality has led you to believe that because your Pap-Pap shot a few Native Americans that you're somehow the spokesperson for righteousness regarding races other than your own, but I advise you to look reality in the fucking face, and beg it to infiltrate your naive mind.",

            "commentText": "I'm gonna hit EVERY \"<b> racism\"</b> in the video, and debunk them all... 1) They claim<b>  black</b> sounding names are less likely to be hired than white sounding names. This is no<b> t rac</b>e discrimination. It is name discrimination. My aunt is a white hippie, and named her children \"Star\" \"Moon Beam\" and \"Flower\". All of her children had trouble getting jobs because of their names in spite of them being white. If she named her kids Sally, James, and Kelly they would be more \"Hire-able\". When<b>  a bla</b>ck mother names her children Le-a, Tyrone, and Jamal instead of Larry, Tyler, and Jeffery same deal.  Don't name your kids something stupid if you want them to get a job one day.<b>  2) Bl</b>ack people are charged roughly 700 dollars more for an automobile. Interesting phenomenon. How<b> ever b</b>lack people are charged the same when they have to pay a phone bill, or go to McDonalds, or get a gallon of gas? Interesting. I would not attribute prices on cars being more for blac<b> ks to r</b>acism. That is simply weaker bargaining skills<b>  among</b> black people as a whole than white pe<b> ople. </b>A black person is capable of getting a reduced price on an auto the same way a white person can, they just gotta learn to bargain bet<b> ter.  </b>3) Black drivers are twice as likely to be pul<b> led ov</b>er. Black people commit more traffic violations? Wh<b> ere is </b>the racism I don't<b>  get i</b>t? 4) Black clients are shown 17.7% fewer homes that are for sale. Again this echo's back to my previou<b> s stat</b>ement. Black people are not as good at bargaining skills. All this<b>  means</b> is the black couple are happy after the fourth house they saw for sale, and the white couple is happy after the fifth house they<b>  saw. I</b>t's not racism at all. 5) Equal marijuana use yet blacks are 4 times more likely to be arrested for it. I don't know how they figured out usage being equal on that one. It is a crime to smoke weed... were they taking a survey asking who breaks the law expecting honest answers? Okay Lets just say it is roughly equal usage, and blacks are about 4 times as likely to be caught smoking weed... I'm gonna tell you a story about this one. When I was in high school I smoked a bit of weed myself. I would always smoke it at home with just one or two friends. I would clean up any weed, and hide it well. I would blow my smoke into a drier sheet inside a paper towel roll to get rid of<b>  the s</b>mell... A black guy I knew would just sit on his porch, or drive in his car smok<b> ing we</b>ed! He was black and more OPEN ABOUT SMOKING and thus he was eventually arrested where I neve<b> r was. </b>That's not racism! That is just him being stupid about it, and me getting away with it because I was more c<b> lever </b>about it. 6) Black people are 6 times more likely to do prison time. Okay lets look at that from a different angle. Women commit far less rapes than men do. A lot less often. Yet many more men are in prison for rape than women. The rate of crime is higher among that demographic so the rate of incarcerat<b> ion refl</b>ects it. 7) Doctors did not inform blacks as often as whites about the importance of a certain heart procedure. This is simply misinformation. Any doctor that would admit to doing this would lose his license for malpractice. 8) legislatures respon<b> d less</b> frequently to black sounding names. See point 1... same exact argument. 9) Finally th<b> ey ask </b>if this is not racism then what <b> is. I'l</b>l t<b> ell you</b> what racis<b> m is. R</b>acism is treating racism as<b>  if it </b>is a 1 way street. Raci<b> sm doe</b>s not only happen to black people. <b> White p</b>eople c<b> an exp</b>erience racism. So can black people. So can asians<b> . So </b>can latinos or any other r<b> ace you</b> can think of. The real racism here is when you m<b> ake th</b>e ignorant portion of the black community, and the liberal white guilt portion of the white community come together and collectively look at blacks as a \"victim\" and whites as a \"criminal\" together painting white people in a bad light. You should be ashamed of yourself<b>  for no</b><b> t telli</b>ng the truth about racism. Racism happens in multiple directions. Tell it how it is, and not just your propaganda hate speech.",

                    "commentText": "I thought hitting enter would post comment on here. Here I'll break it down with some spacing:\n\n\u00a0\nI'm gonna hit EVERY \"<b> racism\"</b> in the video, and debunk them all...\n\n\u00a01) They claim<b>  black</b> sounding names are less likely to be hired than white sounding names. This is no<b> t rac</b>e discrimination. It is name discrimination. My aunt is a white hippie, and named her children \"Star\" \"Moon Beam\" and \"Flower\". All of her children had trouble getting jobs because of their names in spite of them being white. If she named her kids Sally, James, and Kelly they would be more \"Hire-able\". When<b>  a bla</b>ck mother names her children Le-a, Tyrone, and Jamal instead of Larry, Tyler, and Jeffery same deal. Don't name your kids something stupid if you want them to get a job one day.\n<b> \n2) Bl</b>ack people are charged roughly 700 dollars more for an automobile. Interesting phenomenon. How<b> ever b</b>lack people are charged the same when they have to pay a phone bill, or go to McDonalds, or get a gallon of gas? Interesting. I would not attribute prices on cars being more for blac<b> ks to r</b>acism. That is simply weaker bargaining skills<b>  among</b> black people as a whole than white pe<b> ople. </b>A black person is capable of getting a reduced price on an auto the same way a white person can, they just gotta learn to bargain bet<b> ter.\n\n</b>3) Black drivers are twice as likely to be pul<b> led ov</b>er. Black people commit more traffic violations? Wh<b> ere is </b>the racism I don't <b> get it</b>?\n\n4) Black clients are shown 17.7% fewer homes that are for sale. Again this echo's back to my previou<b> s stat</b>ement. Black people are not as good at bargaining skills. All this<b>  means</b> is the black couple are happy after the fourth house they saw for sale, and the white couple is happy after the fifth house they<b>  saw. I</b>t's not racism at all.\n\n5) Equal marijuana use yet blacks are 4 times more likely to be arrested for it. I don't know how they figured out usage being equal on that one. It is a crime to smoke weed... were they taking a survey asking who breaks the law expecting honest answers? Okay Lets just say it is roughly equal usage, and blacks are about 4 times as likely to be caught smoking weed... I'm gonna tell you a story about this one. When I was in high school I smoked a bit of weed myself. I would always smoke it at home with just one or two friends. I would clean up any weed, and hide it well. I would blow my smoke into a drier sheet inside a paper towel roll to get rid of<b>  the s</b>mell... A black guy I knew would just sit on his porch, or drive in his car smok<b> ing we</b>ed! He was black and more OPEN ABOUT SMOKING and thus he was eventually arrested where I neve<b> r was. </b>That's not racism! That is just him being stupid about it, and me getting away with it because I was more cl<b> ever a</b>bout it.\n\n6) Black people are 6 times more likely to do prison time. Okay lets look at that from a different angle. Women commit far less rapes than men do. A lot less often. Yet many more men are in prison for rape than women. The rate of crime is higher among that demographic so the rate of incarcerati<b> on refle</b>cts it.\n\n7) Doctors did not inform blacks as often as whites about the importance of a certain heart procedure. This is simply misinformation. Any doctor that would admit to doing this would lose his license for malpractice.\n\n8) legislatures respon<b> d less</b> frequently to black sounding names. See point 1... same exact argument.\n\n9) Finally th<b> ey ask </b>if this is not racism then what <b> is. I'l</b>l t<b> ell you</b> what racis<b> m is. R</b>acism is treating racism as<b>  if it </b>is a 1 way street. Raci<b> sm doe</b>s not only happen to black people. <b> White p</b>eople c<b> an exp</b>erience racism. So can black people. So can asians<b> . So </b>can latinos or any other r<b> ace you</b> can think of. The real racism here is when you m<b> ake th</b>e ignorant portion of the black community, and the liberal white guilt portion of the white community come together and collectively look at blacks as a \"victim\" and whites as a \"criminal\" together painting white people in a bad light. You should be ashamed of yourself<b>  for no</b><b> t telli</b>ng the truth about racism. Racism happens in multiple directions. Tell it how it is, and not just your propaganda hate speech.",

In accordance with that, the related area of standing on the cutting edge for change is even worse in how demonic peoples try to engineer all this to plague free people of all kinds, (believe JFK and MLK were treated equally with certainty as brothers in spirit) in order to keep an actual separating world of injustice close to the chosen people with a misery tax, on individuals even just standing by or as a part of a moral community, if it's making fair, compassionate progress.  Think of what is behind some tragedies and debilitation.  Get over the finicky drama of images of fancy innocent appearances of privilege, demons blackmail unimaginably vulnerable people by unimaginably mimicking their causes.  It's all too easy to take down vulnerable people in the crosshairs of injustice and justice alike than it is to get real with managing this prolific world for charity, too.",

And supporters would often say its because they are under represented in top schools. Even if that is the case then why dont you apply this logic to sports. I think we can all agree that Asian are under represented in any sports. So to fix this :teams should have affirmative action for Asians to get pick instead of <b> African </b>Americans because of their<b>  race</b> and not their qualifications. This is ridiculous and its no different than affirmative action in schools. And people that support this stupid ideology is pushing for supposedly equal rights, HA that makes me laugh. Would you want your favorite sports team to always lose because they were filled with a bunch of Asians that got in on thei<b> r rac</b>e and not their athletic capabilities . Or would want to have a surgeon that's not to sure on how to do the operation on you because he got into med school  because of h<b> is ra</b>ce and not his qualifications. I dont think you would want either of that ,but sadly we have that going on today in schools. Its baffling how every school text books,teacher ,politicians says the program help minorities  but in actuality it only helps Latinos <b> and Afri</b>can Americans and is suppressing the smallest minority in America and that is Asian Americans. I cringe every time i learn about Affirmative action in school and they away says its to help the minorities.",

Let me start with Homosexuality. White Supremacist absolutely flipped out when same-sex marriage was legalized and in my opinion coming from a Christian, I think people just need to mind their own business. It's not our place to play God, so let people be and just YOU as a person worry about being a good Christian. If most really read the Bible then they would know refusing to work with each other is a sin. Judging people is a sin, and they do all of that. Some mention how Gays molest children, when a lot of them do it themselves and then want to run to God and ask for \"forgiveness\" when caught. Next, <b> Racism.</b> Never think for one minute that because your skin is white that your right and everything else is not. Stop saying<b>  black</b> people need to addres<b> s blac</b>k <b> on bla</b>ck crime because some white people can't even address white on white crime. Atleast people of color create programs in hopes to bring people together and to bring awareness to certain things while some white people rather sit at home and be keyboard warriors. Everyone is beautiful, talented, educated, worth something, but unfortunately some people are not as lucky as others to be told them things or have the means to accomplish their dreams. The real people who's destroying this world are people who's feeding into mindless white supremacists who are trying to provok<b> e a r</b>ace war, but don't be fools and give them what they want, especially when we are coming so far <b> as a na</b>tion, don't give in. To all of the people who are police officers and veterans of other races, yes people do respect your service. Unfortunately I ran acr<b> oss a r</b>acist blogs asking why are people of color, more directed towards blacks, asking why are they even allowed in uniforms. I thank everyone for their service, and I look forward to a better America eventually.",

Stop being associated with an ignorant, violent, sympathy seeking culture and you'll be A+ ok!\n\nI'd love to see this same comparison with Asians vs. Blacks, etc.\n\nYou'd see the exact results.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Asian culture is associated with numerous positive attributes. Intelligence, hard work, etc. It's even an accurate stereotype when you look at their academic performance. Their music reflects this, their food, their countries of origin. Asians are less likely to ask for hand outs, less likely to be on well fare. They are more likely to be business owners and have college degrees, etc. It goes and on.\n\n<b> Black </b>culture is associated with sports, hip hop, violence. They aren't looked at as hard workers. When you look at the stereotype it also fits. In the academic realms blacks do worse than Asians and whites. Hold jobs for shorter periods of time (or not at all) and it all reflects in their music, their food and again their countries of origin. Blacks are also noted as being the primary<b>  race</b> to ask for help, hand outs or to get well fare. This is also reflected in the numerous \"social programs\" to exclusively help blacks that leave whites, Asians and Mexicans out in the cold because apparently it's only blacks that need \"special help\"....\n\nSo yeah. I believe all the statistics in this video. But now let's see if you guys have the balls to really admit why it is the way it is instead of just pointing a finger at an invisible monster calle<b> d racis</b>m.",

The assertion that there are those who dismiss the existence if <b> racism </b>is a straw man. So far as I can ascertain no one makes the claim that<b>  racism</b> doesn't exist. Many people will assert tha<b> t racis</b>m may not be the primary factor in various issues. For example you mentioned some of the issues faced <b> by bla</b>ck men regarding our legal system. However, one little known fact is that when you look at all the factors you actually find that when it comes to your probability of having a run in with the cops the primary determining factor is y<b> our gen</b>der. Secondary to this is your economic sta<b> tus. </b>Race is tertiary to the other two and overlaps heavily with the economic status. After all we aren't exactly s<b> eeing </b>black women or w<b> ealthy</b> black men gunned down by cops. No... Ju<b> st poo</b>r black men. We also see poor white men getting gunned down by cops too like one gentleman who was recently shot 8 times because he was suspected of stealing a bicycle... that he did not steal. Granted yes the skin color makes a difference in the prevalence but not nearly as<b>  much a</b>s gender and economic status. Of course no one is out there claiming the police or legal system is sexist or classist are they?",

Everybody knows what happens if you walk, (God forbid!) into the wro<b> ng bla</b>ck neighborhood. Too many of them to even attempt counting.  Doesn't matter what color you are.

Where do you see white people doing this to <b> any r</b>ace? Do you see white people bitc<b> h if b</b>lack people \"appropriate\" their culture? No. Because we don't give a care about who does what & with who's stuff. We don't try to keep our customs to ourselves or the things we sell.

No not all \"Americans\" are privileged. Some live in worse conditions than people in Africa depending on where you are. Try heading to Mississippi or Detroit. Just because you don't really know what Africa is about, doesn't mean I don't. They only show the worst parts of Africa on TV. Just like they want us to believe It's the same size as America when you could actually fit 3 or 4 America's in Africa. It's a big lie to keep people complacent, while they rape it. \n\nLike I said I'd love to be part of the buildup of Africa.

In American slavery they considered blacks not human or cattle. Property. When you take a person's or people's humanity away, you're open to do anything to them. In other forms of slavery they didn't try to say U weren't human; just that you owed in some way or lost a war. At some point you were able to get your humanity back. I like the way Immortal Tech put it. He said if whites would've just said \"look you just lost the war. That's why we took you. We where stronger than you so we took you. Now that it's over we can return to life as usual.\" But because of how bad the things they did were, they had to consider us inhuman so it didn't feel or look so bad.

If you're willing to pull all whites out of that continent and leave us alone, I think that would be an awesome idea. The \"You wouldn't last\" argument only stands because of the destabilization efforts that have been ongoing for hundreds of years now. How can Africa ever get herself on her feet when whites effectively manipulate the region  as to control the resources? You do the same thing there that you do here. Pump drugs and weapons into areas, pick a side and sit back and watch the carnage. Then you put the results on live TV and say \"see, look at the animals. They can't even get along.\" At some point throughout white's genetic development you learned how to manipulate on an astronomic level. It must have been all that time in cold climates that gave you that ability. All that time in the cold, fending for scraps and turning on your own that produced such an outstanding manipulative capacity. \n\nWhat's wrong with Blacks running Africa and selling you the resources you need? It's not like you want to do the actual work. You can't really survive in the climate without actual help anyway. Why not let us take things over and sell you what you need? We could have a real working relationship here. Humans are specialized for certain environments. Why not create a world wide equilibrium that benefits all? Why not truly work together, instead of fearing one <b> race </b>might take all. We all know each other now. We have no cut cards. Lets work together and move past this planet? \n\nI know the things I'm saying could never happen tho because your hate for blacks far extends resources and land. It's personal. You hate<b>  black</b> men specifically because of how your females feel about us. As Sigmund Freud said \"It's all abou<b> t se</b>x.\" White men are scared of genetic annihilation. They know that if given the choice, women will always pick the guy with the bigger dick. Hopefully when that's not a problem anymore we can get to the business at hand.",

Free speech is only protected in public matters, employment, and businesses that are open to the public. It is not protected from being blocked or banned by individuals or groups on social media platforms. Freedom of speech also does not protect you from getting your ass whooped for being a bigot, and it doesn't protect you from an angry community that defends it's citizens from discrimination and hate. My personal opinion is that <b> racism </b>has no place within our communities and needs to be eradicated, because<b>  racism</b> and other forms of discrimination perpetuate violence against marginalized people. If ISIS was at a park in one of our local neighborhoods recruiting new members and spreading their bigotry against those who were against their caliphate and form of worship, would you allow them to continue to do so, or would you protect their so-called 'free speech'?

            "commentText": "The problem with these types of videos that create <b> Racism </b>and Hate are that they don't take into effect demographics. You send out 100 resumes. So what? They can be the same but you don't send them to the same person. Thus just because one person responds to a white resume it does not mean they would not have responded to the exact same resume by the<b>  black</b> name. Same goes the other way around. A so called study like this does not count as the jobs can't all be the same, the person going through the resume is not the same etc. Thus it's totally random.\n\nBlacks get pulled over more often or get arrested more often for drugs. Again, whats the demographic for these events? Some places have more crime, areas with more crime are predominatel<b> y blac</b>k areas. Thus you can understand the mo<b> re comm</b>on pulling over and arrests. Also you have to look into the backgrounds of those being pulled over. A young white kid with NO RECORD is much less likely to be arrested for Pot than a yo<b> ung bl</b>ack with a record. Si<b> mple co</b>mmon sense.\n\nWhat a lot of you fools<b>  call R</b>acism is simply Stereotypes. Having a stereotype is not the same as b<b> eing a </b>racist. You also need to look at the definiti<b> on of a</b> racist. Not many true racists alive today. There are some but not many. What most people have is stereotypes these days. They don't apply to all that is true but they are BASED ON TRUTH and EXPERIENCE in their creation. Thus it has been done enough and witnessed enough to create the stereotype. Example = Not all Asians drive bad but enough of them sure do to create the stereotype. Don't believe me? Come drive in SF sometime.\n\nStereotypes exist and will until the end of time. Everyone has them and everyone believes in them. They are true to a degree and as mentioned above they are created by experience. Having them does not ma<b> ke you </b>a racist. Simply put if you stick your hand into a fence 20 times and the dog on the other side bites your hand on the 21st time. Then next time you see a dog (any dog) on the other side of the fence you are going to be very cautions before you even try to stick your hand into the fence. Does that mean you hate all dogs? Does that m<b> ake you</b> a racist against dogs? No, it simply means based on a stereotypes and profiling you know there is a chance (however slight) that you MIGHT get bit thus you are a cautions.\n\nLife works the same way. We see stuff of TV, we witness stuff in real life, we hear things and thus it create stereotypes and profiles by which we live our lives. T<b> hat is </b>NOT racism.\n\nSee how that works? Yo<b> ur video</b> is nothing but troll bate and a fabricator of hate.",

As implied in this clip, those statistics overlook the fact that the people arresting and convicting are overwhelmingly white. Coupled with the disparity in employment, and consequently income, non-whites and whites engage in criminal activity at identical rates when adjusted for economic status. Ironically, the higher conviction and incarceration rates are just additional evidence of<b>  racism</b> in our society.",

White America needs to be heard from, not just lectured to.... This time, the Silent Majority needs to have its convictions, grievances and demands heard. And among them are these:\n\nFirst, America has been the best country on earth for<b>  black</b> folks. It was here that 600,00<b> 0 blac</b>k people, brought from Africa in slave ships, grew into a community of 40 million, were introduced to Christian salvation, and reached the greatest levels of freedom and prosperity blacks have ever known.. Jeremiah Wright ought to go down on his knees and thank God he is an American.\n\nSecond, no people anywhere has done more to lift up blacks than white Americans. Untold trillions have been spent since the '60s on welfare, food stamps, rent supplements, Section 8 housing, Pell grants, student loans, legal services, Medicaid, Earned Income Tax Credits and poverty programs designed to bring the African-American community into the mainstream. Governments, businesses and colleges have engaged in discrimination against white folks -- with affirmative action, contract set-asides and quotas -- to advan<b> ce bla</b>ck applicants over white applicants. Churches, foundations, civic groups, schools and individuals all over America have donated their time and money to support soup kitchens, adult education, day care, retirement and nursing homes for blacks.\n\nWe hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude??\n\nBarack talks about new 'ladders of opportunity' for blacks. Let him go to Altoona ? And Johnstown, and ask the white kids in Catholic schools how many were visited lately by Ivy League recruiters handing out scholarships for 'deserving' white kids...? Is white America really responsible for the fact that the crime and incarceration rates for African-Americans are seven times those of white America ? Is it really white America 's fault that illegitimacy in the African-American community has hit 70 percent and <b> the bl</b>ack dropout rate from high schools in some cities has reached 50 percent?\n\nIs that the fault of white America or, first and foremost, a failure of<b>  the b</b>lack community itself?\n\nA<b> s for r</b>acism, its ugliest manifestation is in interracial crime, and especially interracial crimes of violence. Is Barack Obama aware that while white criminals <b> choose</b> black victims 3 percent of th<b> e time</b>, black criminals choose white victims 45 percent of the time?\n\nIs Barack aw<b> are th</b>at black-on-white rapes are 100 t<b> imes mo</b>re common than the rev<b> erse, </b>that black-on-white robberies were 1<b> 39 time</b>s as common in the first three years of this decade as the reverse?\n\nWe have all heard ad nauseam from the Rev. Al about Tawana Brawley, the Duke rape case and Jena . And all turned out to be hoaxes. But about the<b>  epide</b>mic of black assaults on whites that are <b> real, we</b> hear nothing.\n\nSorry, Barack, some of us have heard it all before, about 40 years and 40 trillion tax dollars ago. This needs to be passed around because, this is a message everyone needs to hear!!!",

Some would say Egypt is the most prosperous of <b> black </b>civilizations depending on how you define <b> \"black</b>\" \n\n\nWhile Trillions may have been spent it is notable that blacks in America have been paying taxes since they have existed and there's that elephant in the room of unpaid slave labor.  Also the 14th Amendment would disallow any racial preference via the  equal protection clause, therefore we really cannot consider it a direct benefit to blacks and numerically more whites are on assistance than blacks. \n\n\nI don't think anyone is blaming white america for the problems o<b> f Racis</b>m.  In fact white america very little power other groups.  They are more beneficiaries of the system rather than the controllers.  <b> \n\n\nRaci</b>sm is a system of control by a powerful group of people to limit or award access to resources in every institution.  This is not something that white america controls but rather benefits from.  Thus I'm not blaming white people for mass incarceration. It just so happens that the people that created the laws that they new would be applied unjustly where white. It's perfectly plausible that the same laws could be created by a group that contains other races as well. \n\n\nWhy would a white criminal choos<b> e a bl</b>ack victim at the same rate?   The majority of crime is economics based.  So the incredulity of a white (who is amongst the wealthiest group) singling o<b> ut a b</b>lack (who is of the poorest group economically) for a crime doesn't make sense and the numbers bear this out . \n\n\nRape - the question isn't whether rapes are happening more by a certain segment.  The question is \"are we prosecuting ALL makes that are sexually assaulting women?\"   judging by the new trend of women carrying the mattresses they were assaulted with on campus I'd say that most rape goes unreported and that white males are under-prosecuted.\n\n\nHow was Jena a hoax?  \n\n\nI think if you want to bring real dialogue <b> about R</b>acism you'll skip the phony statistic and be honest and real.",

            "commentText": "This the behavior of white people...!!!\n\nThe sociopath doesn't think like you do\nWhat you see as important, is not of great importance to the sociopath. Firstly, sociopaths see life as a game and you the victim are just a player in the game of life. They see others, quite literally as \u2018fair game'. By trying to seek revenge, in the sociopaths mind, you are being a willing player in the game. You are continuing to play the game with him/her. The sociopath won't mind this, as quite simply they \u2018don't care'. They don't really care about anything except themselves and their own selfish needs. if they fake that they do care, this is usually only to get something for themselves.\n\nIn the sociopath's mind, if you are going to try to exact revenge, then you are becoming a willing participant to:\n\nBlaming\nFraming\nShaming\nThese are the three things that the sociopath will do, should you try to exact revenge. And this is the reason why it is a waste of energy, and will only serve to bring further problems into your life.\n\nFirstly the sociopath will turn the situation around and blame you. If it is evident that you have done <b> nothing </b>wrong, don't be fooled into thinking that because you have done<b>  nothing</b> wrong, then the sociopath will be exposed and you look like the \u2018good guy', it doesn't work like that in the mind of the sociopath. Next stop is Framing, if they cannot effectively blame you \u2013 well then they will frame you. You already know that sociopaths are compulsive pathological liars, manipulative and deceptive.\n\nAfter blaming and framing comes shaming. This is where the sociopath will use everything that they learned about you in the assessment stage, all of your weaknesses to humiliate you and make you feel shame.\n\nAt this point, things are getting much worse for you. If the sociopath owes you money, realistically you are better off writing the money off. As although the sociopath might promise to give you back what they owe you, they will simply use this as a way to extend the game, and stall for time, make excuses. All any interaction with the sociopath does, is to establish you as a player in the game, and also a willing victim for further abuse. To them, you are simply playing the game. This is something that they enjoy.\n\nTaking revenge rarely works\n\nRevenge on the sociopath will rarely work because\n\nThey don't care\nThey are pathological liars and will turn it around on you, using blaming, framing and shaming\nThey don't worry about the future, what is important is right now. They have a lack of long term goals\nThey see life as a game, and you the victim are just a willing player in the game\nThey like to win and retain control and will do just about anything to achieve this\nThey like to play victim, and can use the contact to lure you back in, for a further round of abuse (and will do, if they think that you are useful for further source of supply)\nWhat is the best way to get revenge?\n\nThe best revenge is living well. By establishing no contact, and getting on with your life as if you do not need the sociopath. Even if your heart is breaking, focus on you, and your life, do not waste your energy focusing on the sociopath, and the sociopaths life. It will only bring more negativity into your life.\n\nPositivity attracts positivity. So attract positive things into your life. By focusing on what the sociopath owes you, or trying to get revenge, you \u00a0are focusing on negative energy, and this will only bring further negativity into your life.\n\nBy focusing on you, and your own life, bringing things into your life that are positive, you will bring into your world, more than you had lost with the sociopath, much more than what the sociopath owes you. Its a win win situation for you.\n\nEstablish No Contact\nFocus on you\nRealise that you will not recover losses from the sociopath, \u00a0but that you can recover personal losses in your life, by focusing on you and your life\nBe around people that you trust, that bring out the best in you, people that make you feel good around you. If there i<b> s nobod</b>y, then learn to love your own company, remember what peace there is in silence\nTry to do one thing each day that makes you smile, even if that is going for a walk and admiring the beauty \u00a0in the world, that is nature\nCatch up with other losses, friends, family, rebuild your home, your life\nRebuild your life \u2013 without the sociopath\nRevenge on the sociopath is wasted energy. It will get you nowhere, and will only encourage the sociopath to play the game further with you.\n\nIf you do get tempted\u2026. please remember those three words\n\nBlaming\nFraming\nShaming\nThis is all that you will attract back towards you. Little else (unless the sociopath has committed an illegal offence that can absolutely be proven) \u2013 in this circumstance, call the police, do not deal with it yourself. Remove yourself from the game. Refuse to play the game.\n\nEstablish No contact today, and start focusing on you. Learn to love yourself, find your own inner happiness \u2013 your worth it :)",

His ass better be home doing his homework and chores.     The anger is very real.    You don't have to go far to see  <b> black </b>men venting their rage at  sadly<b>  black</b> women.    But this path was set a long time ago when somehow the idea to figh<b> t patriarch</b>y was a good dose of feminism and the ejection of the father from the home in lieu of a Gov check. \n\n\nI grew up in mostly a single parent household until the end of Jr High.   My step-father stepped up and gave me a precious 5 years of  \"what a man does\".   I don't really give a GD about appeasing  a particular groups feelings.   Boys need a father figure during t<b> he transiti</b>on from pre-teen to young adult or for many it's game over. \n\n\nI feared my step-father much more than my mother.   He also was a police officer for about 4 years and he told me how he couldn't get over the fact that his life was in danger every night and this is coming from a military guy that did overseas deployments.   \n\n\nPolice Officers have a very unique job that is highly stressful . I'm not for police brutality no more than anyone but I'm even more angry at the destruction of families via the demotion of fathers in the home.     /rant     \n\n\nstay safe officer.",

The problem is, every statement you made here is difficult to back up opinion, at best, and, at worst, is factually false. The idea that <b> racism </b>only occurs from \"privilege\", \"status\" or \"institutions\" is a THEORY, mostly propagated by racists, to justify their own<b>  racism</b>. Definitions absolutely matter. Please google<b>  \"racis</b>m def\". Out of the 4 dictionary results that come up for me, only one result even impli<b> es raci</b>st governmental institutions as a possible, secondary supplementary definition AND not one even mentions the words \"privilege\", \"status\" or \"institutionalized\". I am not saying that you believe the following, but, the belief that the accepted definition<b>  of rac</b>ism is insufficient because it was written or influenced by whites, is, ironica<b> lly, ra</b>cist. Your prejudiced assumptions about what I \"am hoping for\" are prejudicial and f<b> alse. R</b>acism is clearly defined and your descript<b> ion of </b>racism is factually wrong. Even if one assumes your statements are correct, you would still have to agree that this video is is discriminatory in its solely portraying whites as discriminatory and blacks as victims of discrimination. Don't get me wrong, my <b> friend.</b> Racism is absolutely a problem and does not make any sense. Please understand the irony in addressing the harm and unfai<b> rness o</b>f racism while simultaneously limiting the scope of the discussi<b> on to</b> the race of those affected.",

So I propose we solve the problem like an economist solves problems. We find the trends, we investigate those trends, and we conclude rational decisions.\u00a0\n\nI<b> f racis</b>m is so pervasive, we must ask why. Now I'm going to piss off a bunch of SJW's here, and that's okay with me ;)\u00a0\n\nMost people kn<b> ow raci</b>sm is wrong, most people don't admit to be<b> ing rac</b>ist, yet people<b>  act ra</b>cist. Look at the statistics, and realize people are often unaware or unwilling to admit if they are sec<b> retly r</b>acist. This isn't a justification, its a trend, lets ask ourselves why. Has morality, or the \"right thing to do\" ever really steered people away from behaviors they wanted to engage in? I don't think so (think to the number of people who claim each other to be immoral) and if you're willing to accept that premise then we can conclude there is something confounding causing the issue.\n\nTelling peopl<b> e that </b>racism is unethical, useless, wrong, immoral, illegal or stupid doesn't seem to convince people to give up that bad habit. Why is that? This is another trend.\n\nEducating them from <b> a yo</b>ung age seems to make people more tolerant, yet in the end they still fall into those same bad habits, albeit much less publicly. Why is that?\n\nAre there any other behaviors we could associate with a population tha<b> t mimic</b>s racism? I believe there are several<b> , chiefly na</b>tionalism, class-ism, affiliations to political parties, ect. People can be moved to great emotion and illogical behavior by these stark divides. Another trend.\n\nI could keep going but I want to postulate this. If we start attacking this problem online, and start discussing with one another constructively the things we think, we as a democracy might be able to formulate a solution that our children can finally enjoy. Instead we feed trolls, point fingers, call names, bog ourselves down in conjecture and commit logical fallacies, all to feed an internal need of ego. Why is that?\u00a0\n\nI think the Internet is this country's only real shot at fixing this problem. Schools won't or can't. Government won't or can't. Businesses don't bother trying much at all. We can though. We can debate, discuss and problem solve together and make a difference. I just say that whats going on down there in the comments is atrocious.",

            "commentText": "So in other words, if cops pull over 50 <b> black </b>people they HAVE to pull over 50 white people too in order to seem fair? The prison thing is ridiculous too. Everyone there was found guilty in a court of law and many of them by a jury of their peers. It wasn't just, white cop sees<b>  black</b> man with a hoody and throws him in prison for 25 to life......\n\nThe assumptions made by these claims are too simplistic and ignore too many other factors as to WHY they are that way. I am not denying tha<b> t racis</b>m exists. OKAY? okay. There will always <b> be raci</b>st people of all races.\u00a0\n\nHere's the thing, I'm willing to confront wh<b> ite rac</b>ism (as a white) head on. Anyone who demeans blacks in front of me based solely on t<b> heir </b>race will get an ass chewing, but I expec<b> t the </b>black community to step up and look at the problems within their own communiti<b> es an</b>d race as well and why <b> so man</b>y black kids never make it through school, have fatherless homes, use drugs, glorify \"thug life\" mentality. Being born poor for example, is NOT an excuse for staying poor and committing crimes. By the way yes i can talk about these issues because we all live in the same country and communities. It's a shared problem.\u00a0\n\nHere is a thing, can I walk into a restaurant full of only white people and start talking out loud using the N word and degrading blacks and blaming them for everything? NO. I would either be kicked out or have my ass kicked, maybe both. At the very very least i would get scowls from people and they would not associate with me. In other words, in the majority of white culture it is WRO<b> NG to b</b>e racist, and cal<b> ling me</b> a racist because I'm white is insulting to<b>  me and</b> is racist itself.\u00a0\n\nAre there poor whites sitting in their trailers smoking crack and committing crimes? ABSOLUTELY! No one is arguing th<b> at on</b>ly one race is capable of committing crime. The problem is that the reason more blacks are in prison is no<b> t becau</b>se of racism, but because of the epidemic of crime, poverty and lack of<b>  educa</b>tion in black communities. UNTIL THAT IS FIXED this problem will continue on and on and on.\u00a0\n\nI don't mind people talkin<b> g openl</b>y about racism. It does still exist. But what I do mind, is when people distort facts or make generalizations about things without digging any deeper. I also hate when we can't have an honest discussion about the plague of problems withi<b> n many</b> areas of black communities that hold back their own success, which is in turn blamed on whites. I'm sure I offended someone, but honestly we need to change how we talk about these issues.",

                    "commentText": "@SylvanaForrester You've posted the following statement: \"I don't really give a shit about how <b> black </b>people experience the world. It's their problem\". No, actually. It's America's problem, for the following reasons (your dearth of sense requires a rather protracted refutation):\u00a0\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\nYou are, presumably, and wish to be considered an American, do you not? If so, then presumably you expect to be treated in a manner that, at minimum, is fair and just under the law (from the U.S. Constitution, on down to the state and municipal statutes).<b>  Black</b> Americans  -  who are not guests in America \u2013 are endowed with all of the same birth rights and protections under the law as you, and have exactly the same expectations.\n\n\n\nIs it a prerequisite that all white Americans be perfect moral individuals today in order for any white American tomorrow to be given fair, just, and non-discriminatory treatment, under the law?\n\n[If a man with blue-coloured skin messes up on Monday, does this mean that all blue people who are treated poorly the following Friday have no legitimate grievances to bring before the larger society (comprised mostly of people with green-coloured skin)?] \n\n\n\nStated differently, should <b> a woma</b>n dressed promiscuously not be taken seriously or does she not have any right under the law of the land to: a fair trial, an able prosecutor, an impartial jury etc. in the matter of an allegation of rape that she has brought if it can be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that someone h<b> ad s</b>ex with her, in this instance, without her consent? Are t<b> his wo</b>man's sartorial preferences, or her lifestyle, germane to whether the matter should proceed to court? Or, are there more relevant and compelling factors to be considered in forming an opinion and drawing any legal conclusion about <b> this w</b>oman's \"allegations\" (specifically, that she did not, on the occasion in question, agree to<b>  hav</b>e sex with the defendant)?\n\n\n\nWHITE PEOPLE BEHAVING BADLY: A CONDENSED HISTORY\n\n\n\nWhen white Europeans packed en<b> slaved</b> black Africans into the bellies of their ships and sent these e<b> nslave</b>d black people thousands of miles across the ocean to a future of misery in the \"land of the free\" this occurred for what reason?\n\nWhen the <b> lives </b>of black people were being quantified by those most enlightened of white men (the floundering fathers who wrote the American Constitution) as somehow being invested with three-fifths the value of a white life is this in any way indicative of the moral putrescence already at work in the hearts of those seeking to bu<b> ild a n</b>e<b> w nati</b>on?\n\nBlack people were relegated to the status of three-fifths a human for precisely what reason?\n\nWhen Martin Luther King Jr. took a bullet to his face on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel it was for what reason, a<b> gain?\n</b>\nWhen bl<b> ack me</b>n, and black women were being knocked senseless by the clubs and batons of white Alabama State Troopers on the Edmund Pettis bridge in 1965 this was done on account of <b> what?\n</b>\n\n\nWhen black Americans travelling throughout the southern United States were refused accommodation by white owners of motels and hotels, <b> and wh</b>en these black people were then forced to sleep in their cars - and the only toilet to be found on such occasions was a bush -  this moral affront to basic human dignity occurred for wha<b> t reas</b>on?\n\nWhen black men were being lynched <b> by th</b>e \u2018s<b> uperio</b>r race' and black women were being raped by \u2018massa' (Thomas Jefferson et al.) it was for what reason, rem<b> ind me</b>?\n\nWhen nine black high school students (the so-called \"Little Rock Nine\") required no less than the 101st Airborne Division of the U.S. Army in order to ... wait for it ... attend the same high school as w<b> hite s</b>tudents these black high school students were spat upon by grown white women and grown white men because they had done what, precisely, to white people?\n\nWhen the innoce<b> nt liv</b>es of 4 little black girls (Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson, and Denise McNair) were snuffed out, in the 16th Street Baptist church bombings of 1<b> 965, </b>by the \u2018superior race' (represented in this instance by the KKK) this was due to what, precisely?\n\n\n\n<b> THE EX</b>PERIENCE OF MANY BLACK PEOPLE IN AMERICA TODAY\n\nWhen H<b> enry L</b>ouis Gates Jr., a black man, and professor at Harvard University was entering his own home and in the process was confronted by police, he needed to explain to the police his lawful entry into his own for what reason, precisely?\n\nWhen Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, and Freddie Gray were the police involved in stated murders endowed with some supernatural cognitive power that would allow them to conclude anything at all about the particular family envir<b> onment</b> from whence these black males came? Or was it,<b>  perha</b>ps, the that stated black males were they playing their iPhones too loudly for the cops' liking?\n\n\n\nWhen the CDC \"whistle blower\", Dr. William S. Thompson, tells America that the CDC intentionally skewed and fudged data that indicated th<b> at young</b> (up to 36 months) African American males were at a greater risk for autism when receiving a certain  vaccine (designed to immunize against measles, mumps, and rubella) then what does this say abou<b> t the </b>value and respect for black life express by s<b> ome m</b>embers of the 'supe<b> rior</b<b> > race</b>? Are these 36 month old black boys already being indicted and dehumanized by white society before they even get a chance to \"act like subhumans\" on any sub<b> way </b>in America?\n\n\n\nWhen 21 year old, white American, Dylan R<b> oof al</b>legedly shoots and kills 9 black members of a bible study group in Charlesto<b> n, SC </b>we know that these murdered black people must have had it coming to them, and that they were either playing their music too loudly, or were the products of single parent households. Correct? \n\nIrrespective of the fact that the American congress allowed the supreme commander-in-chief, that most upstanding of white individuals, George H.W. Bush to initiate a war against Iraq on the basis of a carefully crafted lie, this according to your reasoning cannot be ascribed to any moral depravity of the greater white masses. Rather, this war should apparently, at the very least, be taken as yet anot<b> her e</b>xample of the \u2018in-corruptible race' re-aligning the moral compass for the rest of humanity. Is that not true?\n\n\n\nWhen Paul Castellano, Italian American mafiosi and head of one the five criminal syndicates based in the boroughs of New York city (your favourite place to party) is gunned down in a gangland execution by rival mob factions we know that this, while morally reprehensible, can in no way be ascribed to the proclivities and sensibilities of white Americans as a whole, right? Further, we can go so far as to claim that these mobsters a<b> re not</b> white people at all; they're black. After all, \"this [type of behaviour] has abso<b> lutel</b>y no equiva<b> lent a</b>mong any other race\" except for black people according to you.\n\nWhen Ludwig Fainberg et al. were heading up the Russian mafia based out of Brighton Beach, New York they were, presumably, more interested in games of chess than in extortion, murder etc. and thus should never have been arrested and indicted. After all, these were 'good boys', from good families. At minimum, they were white men and we should all, presumably, take some comfor<b> t from </b>that. Correct?\n\nSimilarly, when Whitey Bulger (the notorious Irish American gangster based formerly out of Boston) was charged (in 2011) with no less than 19 counts of murder (among other things) we can safely assume <b> that th</b>is must be some sort of mistake. Whitey, after all, is - dare I state it - white. He would never behave i<b> n such </b>an irremissible manner. Hell, ol' Whitey has probably never acted like a 'subhuman' on the subway, or rocked an iPhone without the good sense to, at least, wear some gosh darn headphones. \n\n\n\nWhen white people attending the G20 summit (of 2010) in Toronto, Canada rampaged, looted, defaced and damaged property and fought with t<b> he polic</b>e this can be dismissed as having nothing to do with the proclivities of whites in general, correct? And, the same conclusion can presumably be drawn after witnessing white people riot subsequent to a hockey game held<b>  in </b<b> >Vanco</b>uver, in 2011, no?\n\nEighteen year old black male Michael Brown is confronted by a white cop and, though he (Michael Brown) is unarmed he is shot and killed  -  murdered  -  by this cop who apparently believed that the penalty for walking down the middle of the street (and not the sidewalk) is instant exec<b> utio</b>n. By contrast, James Holmes, a 24 years old at the time, and a  white American, walks into a movie theatre dressed as Batman and allegedly unloads his guns against the patrons in the theatre, killing 12 people and injuring 58 other people but (lo and behold) Mr. Holmes is arrested by police. Not shot on the spot. Arrested. Mr. Holmes will began his day(s) in court in April of this year (2015). No such \u2018luck' for Mike Brown who, as we know, is dead. Not arrested. Dead.\n\n\n<b> \nWhe</b>n a white teenager, Ethan Couch (16 years old at the time was legally intoxicated and, as a result, slammed his pickup truck into four innocent people, killing them all), is deemed  by another white individual, Judge Jean Boyd, to be the victim of and suffering from some such affliction as \"affluenza\" (purportedly too rich to be expected to have been more responsible) and is not sentenced to jail but, rather, is given probation and ordered to report to a \"rehab\" clinic for rich kids this in no way should illicit a moment's pause or reflection on the privilege enjoyed by rich white Americans, correct?\n\nNever mind that <b> the </b<b> >same </b>judge, Jean Boyd, sentenced a 14 year old black minor to a 10 year sentence in a juvenile detention centre (after the un-named minor punched another individual who then fell hitting his head on the pavement and later died in hospital). Indeed, according to your statements, Ethan, like you  \"at the end of the day get[s] to be white and enjoy all of the perks of being white and that's fine by [you].\" \n\nIt matters not, according to your own 'logic' that Ethan Couch's own familial upbringing can be called into question as evinced by the fact that none other than his (Ethan Couch's) father, Fred Couch  - apparently not wanting to be outdone by his son when it comes to behaving like a fool  -  <b>  was arr</b>ested for allegedly imp<b> ersonati</b>ng a cop. Nothing to see here though, and nothing can be inferred from this, right? These, after all, are white people ... I have to keep on reminding <b> myself</b>.\n\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nI am not here suggesting<b>  that </b>black people are beyond reproach. If we (i.e. black people) wish to be viewed as fully human then this, by definition, comes with certain 'baggage'; it means, at the outset, that we are not perfect. It means, also, that when we assert or humanity and our right to be treated with respect and dignity (before God, and before the U.S. Constitution) then we ought to be prepared for the inevitable and predictable countervailing assertion that says, basically, \"Yeah, you see. Finally y'all admit that you people a<b> re a .</b>. b .. c .. d etc.)\n\n\nIn fact, all we're (i.e. black people) admitting' is that we are human. We have never relinquished, and we never will give up any of our rights before God and before the law. And, rest assured, we will prevail over those forces that would seek, as you do, to dehumanize us - all the while as we struggle with the failures and foibles of our humanity.\n\n\nA great, great man once told your forebears, and is saying to you, \"Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of t<b> hese b</b>rothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.\"\n\n\nBlack people in America are, and always have been, the moral conscience of the republic. That frustration you feel is you moral conscience talking to you. What goes around, as they say, eventually comes around. And I don't refer here to karma; I refer to judgement.",

They racially profile, harass, and stalk people until they can find someone to\u00a0bust\u00a0 for petty drug offenses or traffic violations. White neighborhoods don't have to go through being patrolled and stopped by the police 24/7, if they did maybe the cops would be booking white offenders at the same rate as other ethnicities.

            "commentText": "Your \"experiment\" is a failure because you are making a fundamental mistake in your assumption that all factors are equal between all races (not BOTH races). You negate the historical actions of certain people. Humans have the natural ability to learn from the past and assess threats based on previous experience. What you are asking people to do is ignore that natural instinct and take the time to assess each person individually. Yes, that would be ideal in a perfect world, but our world is far from perfect. What you are asking people to do is akin to asking a gazelle not to fear a lion because THAT PARTICULAR lion didn't kill his family. Sure, there is a chance that the gazelle will be just fine and THAT PARTICULAR lion isn't going to hurt him, but it is unreasonable to expect the gazelle to take that chance.\n\nI am fully aware that you will disagree with these statements because you want to believe that all people are good and that we just haven't given certain people a fair chance or that they are at some sort of a disadvantage. But you're wrong. I'm sorry but the truth can be inconvenient at times. People usually act the way they do because of past experience, either their own or that of others. It doesn't make them right, but it is a natural instinct designed to protect them. In a perfect world, all men would be treated equally and the color of one's skin would be no more important than the color of their eyes, however as long as certain groups cast a negative light upon themselves (i.e. Baltimore looters) then there will always be a perpetuation of stereotypes. Stereotypes created by the actions of a particular group.\u00a0\n\nLastly, please don't blame lack of opportunity. Minorities in America receive the vast majority of public assistance and have many educational opportunities available to them based solely on the color of their skin. <b> Racism </b>is a two way street.",

This is the reason why someone with a degree yet no experience isn't valued as much as someone with a degree and a good amount of experience. \n\n\nWatching something on Fox News does not constitute experience.  You have no personal interaction that you can glean anything from.   Stereotypes are born of propaganda and humans with the ability to use reason and logic should be able to apply a bit of critical thinking about why things are the way they are and who may be the ones affecting such behaviors. \n\n\nLooking at a plethora of data from a variety of sources and attempting to cast it aside in favor of \"natural instinct\" and stereotypes strikes me as an anathema to logical thinking and reason.",

I'm a huge statistics/experiment <b> junkie </b>so I thought I'd review all of the sources in the video in terms of reputability and other points.\n\nResume Study - Solid. No other key things I can find.\n\nCar Dealership Study - Solid, but I don't get why you sourced a NYT article and not the original study. Anyways, the study creators' saw this not as a \"I hate these people so I will charge them more\" thing - but that the car dealers automatically assumed that white people would have higher reservations on prices.\n\nTraffic Studies/Meta Analysis' - Solid.\u00a0No other key things I can find.\n\nHousing Study - Solid. No difference in appointments or single properties shown. 17% difference is in being shown multiple homes. Similar to the authors' of the car dealership study, these authors' wondered out loud if this is a (intentional or not) statistical analysis based on likelihood of a certain<b>  race</b> to end up buying.\n\nMarijuana Study - Solid.\u00a0No other key things I can find.\n\nHeart Procedure Study - Findings seem to be controversial. Previous study authors actually came back and wrote a rebuttal to the study indicating that this wasn't at all what the study found. Furthermore, recommendations have been argued to be based on statistical medical/physiological differences between blacks and whites.\n\nLegislator Experiment - Solid for when legislators were white but interestingly if the legislator was a minority - they responded to<b>  \"blac</b>k\" sounding names more often.\n\n\n---------\nOverall, basically everything in this video was on point... with some minor exceptions/notes.... video creators' y'all should be sure to include the study links in the description - also your source notes often have wrong titles/years/authors.",

            "commentText": "WHOA!! Seriously watch this video again because it only projects half the truth. WOW... Did I hear that correctly. B and W use marijuannauana equally,  yet B are 6 times more likely to be arrested. Arrested for what?  Marijuanna use, or committing other crimes? Also on average a B man gets charged $700 more for a car than a W man. It's not  because the salesman is racis.  he's gonna try to get the most out of any <b> race </b>of costumer, that's his job and livelihood. The reason this statistic exists is because on average W are more educated than B. And thus Are more educated at negotiating car sales on average. Run that statistic using Asian, Hispanic, or<b>  Indian</b> v<b> s Blac</b>k and on average blacks will pay more. Just a few examples at how this video isn't telling us the whole truth. \nBut anyways.........\nThis isn't just as much a BvsW issue its more of a poverty issue IMO.... Plz let me explain. There are many issues in poor or lower class families and I'm talking about all colors of skin. It doesn't just affect blacks, Infact poverty is col<b> or bli</b>nd and affects \"all colors of skin\" \n Most importantly is education. Statistics prove that children who grow up in lower income families, go to school with other kids who's families are lower income,  and live in a part of town that has higher crime rate, more drug use, gangs, ect. Kids who grow up in this environment are more likely to commit a crime, join a gang, use drugs, and have a lower level of education due to the above issues. And it will get repeated  again and again until \"we the people\" help to educate these young kids who's parents are cought in the cycle and aren't able to educate them.  AMEN \n\nREMEMBER PEOPLE WE ARE ALL O<b> NE \"R</b>ACE\", the H<b> UMAN </b>RACE. The sooner we agree on this the sooner we will live In a world that will be fre<b> ed of r</b>acism. However we will not live to see it. Maybe our kids kids will. \n(JUDGING SOMEONE BASED ON THERE SKIN PIGMENT IS IGNORANT!) we are all individuals.",

I will say that <b> racism </b>is very much alive people, it is not to long ago that it started to really die off within the 1900's. That does not mean that it is completely gone. I have not been accepted by blacks, puerto ricans, except for a few white people who joke about<b>  racism</b> and actual asians who do not. I say this only because blacks have been obviously oppressed their whole lives in america even though its a land of equal and great oppertunity. A contradiction yes but if you look at it once blacks were free, whites and people in general who were in power within the south would falsy imprison them for free labor in prison and such and so forth. Also \u00a0another point is that othe<b> r ethni</b>c groups worked on most of america like the railroads (asians<b> ). Raci</b>sm is incredibly stupid but also has many of variables and things to honestly work out fact wise. This video, I like but it is missing some facts. Also this is just a piece of the puzzle the justice system frowns upon men in certain instances and equality is a far off dream at the moment but it is getting there.

So to fix this :teams should have affirmative action for Asians to get pick instead of <b> African </b>Americans because of their<b>  race</b> and not their qualifications. This is ridiculous and its no different than affirmative action in schools. And people that support this stupid ideology is pushing for supposedly equal rights, HA that makes me laugh. Would you want your favorite sports team to always lose because they were filled with a bunch of Asians that got in on thei<b> r rac</b>e and not their athletic capabilities . Or would want to have a surgeon that's not to sure on how to do the operation on you because he got into med school  because of h<b> is ra</b>ce and not his qualifications. I dont think you would want either of that ,but sadly we have that going on today in schools. Its baffling how every school text books,teacher ,politicians says the program help minorities  but in actuality it only helps Latinos <b> and Afri</b>can Americans and is suppressing the smallest minority in America and that is Asian Americans. I cringe every time i learn about Affirmative action in school and they away says its to help the minorities.",

            "commentText": "This would all be solved by people not being lazy and fearful thinking of the unknown, and believing what there friends say or the news etc... A lot of beliefs of humans are not from - a current- experience but from what they have been taught (through family, community, friends or one's own negative experience). So as humans we base our thoughts on things that we have not directly experienced, its funny because through my travels, i have found that even people of the same <b> ethnic </b>group or<b>  race</b> are prejudice against one another. They feel a shame associated with one's own view of hi<b> s rac</b>e.(SAD). Even within political parties(rural white people have more <b> in comm</b>on with ur<b> ban bl</b>ack folk than middle class suburban people regardles<b> s of </b>race, yet they vote against each other because that's what there community does. It's s<b> ooooo </b>crazy how an unjustified image(that this will benefit one over the other) that totally overemphasized in the media and popular culture. Because of ratings and money.\n\nThe powers that be will have us americans who have so m<b> uch in </b>common be brainwashed and so busy trying to make a living and focused on money, family and materialism. They feed us like we can't think for ourselves. Stop being lazy and fearful, educate yourself, step out of your comfort zone, you will shocked of the many great people there are , with great and unique talents ,regard<b> less </b>of race.",

The vast majority of whites are right there with you on the issue of equality but that message is driving such a large wedge between countrymen that the span could conceivably become unbridgeable.

It's like getting a B in a class and using that as a reason to fail instead of working to get an A. The fact remai<b> ns tha</b>t black people today are largely to blame for their own predicament. Instead of trying to harp<b> oon the</b> \"racist\", spend more time to starting projects to help turn ghettos into better neighborhoods. Spend your time making the hood a safer place to live for the families there instead of complaining about oppression. Be the change you wish to see in t<b> he world</b>. Nothing is going to change until someone c<b> hanges</b> it. Black people have a rich culture, they've contributed to music greatly, they have contributed to human rights, and a lot more. Don't let that go to waste in some goose ch<b> ase aga</b>inst racism, instead use the hate against you as inspiration to better your commun<b> ity a</b>nd your race as a whole. Be proud, not ignorant.",

            "commentText": "1. Why would a white person rather choose a <b> black </b>to hire knowing about racial tension and cultural problems/differences? Not saying this can't be obviously an issue for<b>  black</b>. But this could be an issue down the line for an employer especially if th<b> e blac</b>k employee is let go they could clai<b> m \"raci</b>sm\" just because they <b> are bl</b>ack. 2. If you are savy online & car shop you should be able to get a invoice price for a car before you go to the dealership which will be lower than the \"in store price\", as well you can negotiate a price in store. If you have the invoice you are guaranteed at least that price, if you don't negotiate you don't get a better deal. 3. If blacks are more likely to get pulled over, is it not possible they are more likey to be pulled over for an offense? For example a tale light was out, had illegal tinted windows, smog is coming out of the car etc. more often then whites because they are \"poorer on average\"? 4. Possibly they are shown 17% fewer houses because they \"can't\" afford as many options on average. 5. Blacks possibly get caught more with marajuana because they are more likely to be \"selling it\" or their car smells like weed when getting pulled over? 6. Blacks commit more crimes than whites so they are incarcerate more? 7. Open heart surgery don't know about that one. 8. Responding to blacks <b> with b</b>lack sounding names again goes back to racial and cultural never ending conflicts of interest.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion\u00a0\u00a0 You cannot make a correlation to be a negativ<b> e or \"r</b>acism\" first and deny any other possiblities while presenting this as a \"fact\".

What speaks louder than information? Seeing it in actuality. Seeing how people treat others. Seeing how people react to being treated differently.

            "commentText": "These statistics are all highly questionable. First, in our current jew/marxist anti-White cultural climate, these types of studies are often undertaken with the intent to 'prove' discrimination and the honesty of the study is to be questioned.\nBut specifically:\n'<b> Black-</b>sounding names were 50% less likely to be called back.'\u00a0\u00a0 Well what are <b> 'black</b>-sounding' names? If they included the made-up names so prevalent among negroes (Laquanda, Quinita, Shaniqua, etc.) then experience will prove to anyone that these non-conforming names are a hallmark of an economic underclass. So if a bias did actually exist, it could simply be the perception of the less educated. And for those that would say the resume would show an education, I point out that most degrees are essentially meaningless these days, with university standards being in the toilet, including due to affirmative action. So having a degree on a resume is no longer any indication of whether the person is smart, or intellectually disciplined.\n\u00a0<b> \n'Blac</b>k people are charged prices roughly $700 higher than White people when buying cars<b> .'\nBla</b>ck people have worse credit from earning less money and not paying their bills on time, and so are paying higher finance charges. So it's not discrimination against blacks, but against people with bad credit history.\n\u00a0\n'Multiple studies s<b> how bl</b>ack drivers are twice as likely to get pulled over.'\u00a0\nThis proves discrimination against blacks ONLY if you believe the lie that there are no behavior differences between races. The fact is that blacks are more likely to be committing infractions that get them pulled over. I've lived in predomina<b> ntly b</b>lack areas and can attest to this myself, with blacks more likely to do very stupid anti-social things on the road like driving in breakdown lanes on the highway, using right turn lanes as ways to jump ahead of cars in the lane to go straight, and other nonsens<b> e.\n\u00a0\n'</b>Black clients are shown 17.7% fewer houses for sale.'\u00a0\u00a0 Blacks make less money, so there are fewer houses they can afford compared to higher earning Whites and Asians.\n\u00a0\n'Marijuana use is equal between blacks and white<b> s. Yet</b> black people are 4 times more likely to be arrested.'\nFirst, it doesn't say what they are arrested for, which is cause for suspicion. But even if what it wants you to infer is true, see above. Blacks are often behaving in other ways that get them stopped by police, who will then charge them with everything else they find them doing that's illegal, whether it's holding marijuana or a switch bl<b> ade.\n\u00a0</b>\n'Black people are incarcerated at nearly six times the rate of White people.' The easiest one to debunk. Blacks commit more crimes. Period. End o<b> f stor</b>y. Black males are 6% of the population and commit 45% of all murders. OF COURSE they're more likely to be in jail, as they should be.\n\u00a0\n'White legislators did not respond as frequently to constitu<b> ents w</b>ith black sounding names'.\nSame as ab<b> ove ab</b>out 'black sounding names'. It bespeaks of lower class people, those with less money and social influence and so they are less useful to a politician.\n\u00a0\nThen it ends with 'If<b>  this i</b>sn't racism\u2026'\nY<b> es, it </b>ISN'T racism. For 100 years now the subversive jews (like jew ROBERT GREENWALD of Brave New Films) who hate Whites and this country have been pumping out pr<b> opagan</b>da that black failure is evidence of White oppression. But they claim it is to be assumed there are no differences between races, when the science has proven over and o<b> ver a</b>gain that RACE IS REAL, and the differences include intelligence, temperament and behavior, and physical abilities.\n\nNo more jew lies. No more undeserved White guilt. Blacks are failures because of their inherent differences. If you truly love negroes, and especially if you subscribe to the faith-based new-state-religion that they are just as capable as Whites, then you should support deporting all American negroes to Africa to live up to their full potential away from White 'oppression' and free to create their own culture and civilization, rather than continue to underperform in<b>  ours.</b>\n\nAnd the alien agitators and destroyers in our midst like ROBERT GREENWALD of Brave New Films need to be expelled with them.",

That these foundation of stereotypes built over time about us (by white people) don't effect how people look at us and how we look at ourselves? Slavery has left an ever-lasting effect on <b> a rac</b>e of people, almost like a ripple effect. After slavery, there was t<b> he Jim <b> Cr</b</b>>ow era, after<b>  the Ji<b> m </b</b>>Crow era which was a little over 50 years ago, we're still fighting for equality, still trying to see change. For too many years white people have b<b> ullied</b> black people but when we fight back suddenly we're wrong. There is no such thing as <b> reverse</b> racism. A bully can't hit the defensless and when the defensless suddenly hit back call him a bully as well. It doesn't work like that.\n\nWe associate<b>  \"acti</b>ng black\" with being stupid, uneducated, loud, ghetto, messy. We associate \"acting white\" with speaking properly, dressing nicely, being friendly; and I can admitt that you I've told someone that they \"act white\" without even realizing that there is no such thing, just an idea built overtime by white people.\n\nTell me, what is a difference between a white <b> man an</b>d a black man? <b> Absolute</b>ly nothing. One might think the white man is a christan man, hard-working business owner, married with two children living the all-American dream. One migh<b> t thin</b>k the black man is an uneducated thug, jobless, father of 6 (but not in their lives) who sells drugs for a living. \n\nAnd it's truly sad because that's how people see it when in reality, the roles could be switched but the majority in America are brain-washed and is suffocating in their false-sense of superiority. \n\nThe media is biased, and only appeals to the majority on certain issues . For example, what's going on in Baltimore. But have you even heard about what's going on in Huntington, California? Probably not. The white youth there, is rioting over a surfing tournament. Fighting each other, looting stores. But that doesn't get any press? I wonder why. It's to continue to perpetrate stereotypes and keep the majority of America clueless, brainless sheep.",

                    "commentText": "@Aerial Mitchell\nYou're not paying close enough attention.\nI never said white people as a whole have it as bad as blacks. I am however saying that some white people, and it's a hell of a lot more than 1 in 100 million (there are 70,000 serbian immigrants in St Louis alone), also lacked the privilege granted to white Americans with European lineage who have been here for a century or more. Eastern European whites, Armenian whites, and other groups who fled violence and migrated here with <b> nothing </b>between WWII up until now lack the same kind of privilege of having resources and opportunities accumulated over many years past to forward generations.\nIndeed they don't have to deal with the perception of<b>  black</b>, which isn'<b> t nothin</b>g, but they also lack the most tangible attributes linked to being white in America.\nAs for your last question, I would love it if not only could I <b> be bla</b>ck for a day, but if many blacks could try being white, because I don't deny be<b> ing bl</b>ack is more difficult, but I also think people would be surprised at what does happen to whites.\nI'm a white guy and I hear all the time about things whites allegedly never experience and I'm baffled by the degree to which people think we're care free. Me and my brother have been stopped many times by the police in the community we grew up in for just walking to and from the park, naturally they were insulting and tried hard to humiliate us each time, on these walks I've had other white people see me, cross the street, and cross back when they pass, and we've had police search our homes because they foun<b> d an</b> old ID of a friend who had a warrant in my brothers car<b> .\nThe </b>crazy thing is it was a nice neighborhood and I looked like a nerd, but we still had cops hounding <b> us for n</b>othing. I think a lot of people wouldn't believe that stuff happened.\n\nBack to the point, I agree blacks have been disadvantaged, but I don't think its the role of our corrupt government to supply people with other peoples money because ones struggles is more popular than the other. I think Natives should keep what they were given, but I don't think they should be constantly given regular payments or anything.\n\nHow much do you trust our government to do good this time when given the right to treat people differe<b> ntly </b>on race? Do you <b> want </b>one lump sum of reparations or sparsed out over time? Do you think that could incentivize segregation so that interracial couples don't want to have a kid that's too white and won't receive benefits?",

At first, I treat others how I would like to be treated, but if they're not treating me respectfully, then I will stop giving a fuck and treat them how they treat me.\u00a0\n\nYou did not understand my statement, therefore you are not smart. Hmm, that's a fallacy. I knew what you meant. I have a year left to continue getting these good grades so I will graduate. There you go.\u00a0\n\n\"We\"? You mean that other dude I had schooled earlier? Oh, okay. Bitch, do you know me personally to make such assumptions? Who ended the slave trade- Europeans. I laugh too much at you. I I\u00a0schooled you on too much so I'm asking you what part of my teaching did you want me to go back and review for your slow ass? \u00a0I'm being as nice as I can, I really am.\u00a0\n\nYou can't tell me her name because you're not being truthful about it. People like you randomly hatch from eggs, you don't have relatives. And if you do, I'm going to need sources to prove it, please. I don't believe that story for a minute. You're very imaginative though so I will give you a 10 for creativity.\u00a0\n\nWhite Genocide? I never heard of that. Surely it would be in the history textbooks. I never in my life have heard of the \"White Genocide\"? You sound stupid as hell, lmao. Getting \"beat up\" is <b> nothing </b>compared to having a entire system built against you. I never said white people were inherently<b>  racist</b>, but surely the majority of you have this false-sense of superiority when being compared t<b> o blac</b>k people and I'm pretty sure a story like that would make headlines. Matter of fact, I searched it up a<b> nd nothi</b>ng came up. Very peculiar.\u00a0\n\nI don't push white guilt, white people push that themselves when they constantly deny the effects that their forefathers have on the rest of the world. I don't think you should be guilty, I think you should be truthful and admit that your forefathers fucked up the world and now we're left with poor countries because of European colonization, stereotypes, people who can't accurately trace back their bloodlin<b> es, rac</b>ism, etc.\u00a0\n\nI have been a victi<b> m of ra</b>cism before so do not speak for me.",

These people are white Africans, many of them have never set foot in Europe. They are white Africans, not white Europeans. Now what if the white person native to Africa moves to America? That person will be an<b>  African</b> American. This is because he was born in Africa, and migrated to America. Your use of the term<b>  \"Africa</b>n-American\" is really only used in the U.S. to soothe the butthurt blacks (which are native to America) who did not like to be call<b> ed bla</b>ck.\n\nMost Mexicans have recent ancestry in Europe. Do you call them Europeans? No. When they migrate to America, we call them Mexican-Americans.\u00a0The majority of those coming in to America are white.\n\nThose that are not white have a look relative to what natural selection intended for the humans living in that region. They would be Mexican, or Mexican-American, but they are not white.\n\nFor someone who acts like she knows about the whole world, your understanding of the English language shows how you are bound to the U.S.A.\n\nYou must know a lot about jokes, considering you've managed to make a complete joke out of yourself.\n\nMitchell sounds like the last name of your ancestor's owner.

Besides even If I gave you a victim's name, you probably wont find anything regarding the incident as they don't do a very good job of telling people about this.

You will see the people there still have similar characteristics from everyone in the world.

Most estimations are much lower because many police officers in SA are not reporting these crimes and tur<b> n a bl</b>ind eye. However, It is safe to say many missing white people were murdered.

We use t<b> he te</b>rm race to distinguish different groups of people based on the characteristics that natural selection intended for humans living in certain regions. (How many times do I need to repeat \u00a0myself?)\n\nNo one ever said we were different species. I already stated that at one point, different human species coexiste<b> d on</b> the old world such as homo neanderthalensis, homo sapiens, homo erectus, and homo floresiensis. The ancestors of homo neanderthalensis and homo floresiensis were from Africa, but they were secluded in their environment for a very VERY long time that they eventually became their own species.\n\nWe all know we are all homo sapiens, we also know that there a differences in appearance based on location. This is the result of natural selection.\n\nGeneticists look at the DNA present in white blo<b> od cells</b>. Nothing more, it does not surprise me that a geneticist will say this.\n\nAn anthropologist looks at physical structure and DNA.\n\nAlso, you will not explain anything to me because you don't even understand the article. I've already said that my skin color was not a result of mutation. You said it was, and the article tips in my favor.\n\nSaying we are al<b> l the</b> same race (not species) is like saying we are a<b> ll the </b>same gender. It is not <b> true, </b>even a blind person can tell the difference between people.\n\nEvery once in a while a geneticist will come<b>  out </b>and say \"race does not exist\" as a way to get people<b>  to sto</b>p being racist.

You mean, all those years of mistreatment and destruction do not play a role in how people look at us as inferior today or how we get treated today? You mean, this entire time, we've been our own demise?\u00a0\n\nMy point was, or is that white people have, for many years, been the source<b>  of bl</b>ack peoples' problems and we are not blaming anything on white people, we have been trying to get you all to understand that.

That comment speak more about you and your intention then my actually character. I did read the conversation and have yet to see any actually solutions just debating about statistics which is pointless and a waste of time. This conversation is all over Youtube over and over again people bicker. With out questioning the information they present and even worst they don't do the research. From what I read you don't do much research or fact checking. Even still that a side point and avoids my true concern. The inability to be a original and generate ideas based off of actual facts and not statistics. Statistics does not equal facts. Correlation doesn't equal causation. If you can generate actual ideas then we can debate there merits like educated individuals. Thank you for your compliment. Also this thread has consistently shown a lack of maturity. That is mostly what I have concluded from the rambling that can be seen as a conversation.",

Just because they do not appeal to you that does not mean they are not ideas.\n\nGathering statistics is a form of research whether you want to accept that fact or not. I have come up with hypotheses based on statistics. Hypotheses other scientists have had great interest in. Sometimes solutions/conclusions are made based on statistics we have generated ourselves. We do not live in a perfect world, and everyone is different, facts aren't always present in every debate. Surely someone as educated as you make yourself seem should know this. However, you are not educated. In fact, you give off a narcissistic vibe. Do not flatter yourself. Especially if you do not have a solution yourself, while bagging on others for not having one.",

I understand it's called ghetto yet in any other culture in any other country it would be called creole or krio not \"ebonics' <- now that's a made up word. but i guess that's ok because...why? there's no explanations or even no one knows how it became to be called that. i know it's a very recent term like maybe came out in the 90's or so.\u00a0\nAnother thing you keep mentioning is years as if culture differences have an expiration date.\u00a0\nThe same things that happened in the 1950's still happen today but if you are caught you can be sued but people are rarely caught so while you may get a ticket from a police i could get killed.\nYou guys see us as second class citizens and not real americans but my ancestors were here before yours.\nBut my ancestors never got anything from fighting in wars or helping people through civic service.\u00a0\nAnd when you do ratio math it works like this. 370 million white people divided by 50 million<b>  black</b> people so if there are 600,000 blacks with a criminal record of any kind it doesn't even have to be \u00a0something bad and serious that will land you in prison guess what? that's 12 percent! LMAO wow you guys good smear campaign. No blacks are not all saints I'm saying actually for us to be a minority were pretty visible it from business to sports and academics with a history of oppression. kindly fuck off and leave us alone.",

Why can't<b>  black</b> Americans do the same?\"\n\nI would like to address this from two different directions:\n\n1. Roughly 24-27% (it fluctuates every year) o<b> f blac</b>k Americans live below the poverty line.  I got that statistic from 2010 US census data, (since I know you are a stickler for people citing their sources.)   Granted, that is almost triple the percentage of white Americans who live in poverty, but to try and intimate that poverty and blackness are synonymous is inaccurate.  I myself am an upper middle-cla<b> ss bla</b>ck adult who was born and raised in an upper middle-class household to parents who had themselves been born and raised in middle-class households by their own parents who had what passed <b> for bl</b>ack middle-class origins in<b>  the Ji<b> m </b</b>>Crow South.  I am not an anomaly, or some kind of rare unic<b> orn of</b> black success.<b>    Mos</b>t black Americans are middle-class, and some of us are even wealthy, which means that we are getting educations and working and supporting ourselves and our families.  Don't try to pretend that \"ghetto\" culture or \"thug\" culture is the full <b> scope </b>of black culture.  Most of us are just regular people who have the same relative values and work ethic as the next (white/asian/latino/whatever) schmoe, except that we often have people asking us \"why can't your people just get over sl<b> avery a</b>nd racism and pull it together?\"  Considering the t<b> hings </b>that black folks had to fight against only one or two generations ago, I'd say that a lot of us have indeed \"gotten ourselves together.\"   Some of us are having a harder time of it.  You could help, if you want to; if you care.  There's no law that say<b> s that</b> only black people are allowed to<b>  mento</b>r poor black children or donate books to poorly-funded schools in bad neighborhoods.  Or you can con<b> tinue </b>to  say black people are responsible for their own problems and feel no obligation to do anything but sit back and feel smug about it.  That's your choice, too.\n\n2.  You may not believe it,<b>  but m</b>any poor black children are not ever told by anyone who matters to them that they can be smart and successful.   They don't see many real life examples of hard work resulting in economic stability.  They have downtrodden parents who work long hours at low-wage jobs (or sometimes don't work at all, for various legitimate or illegitimate reasons,) and are one missed or shorted paycheck from living on the street. They have jaded teachers who expect them to under-perform and who shrug their shoulders when they fail (many of the optimistic teachers burn out or move on to better school districts ASAP.)  They have peers who perpetuate the idea that education is for white people<b>  by ca</b>lling any black child who speaks properly and likes to read/study a<b>  fake</b>/phony/oreo/race traitor, and humiliate them or ostracize them until they fall back into what's \"expected\" of them.   They have the vast majority of the media glamorizing criminal behavior in the \"urban community,\" telling them that the only guaranteed ticket out of the ghetto is slinging drugs or becoming a rap star.\n\nOh, or playing pro ball, because blacks may not be too smart, but they sure can run fast./sarcasm\n\n\nAll of that is demoralizing, and some people are strong enough to overcome it and succeed anyway, but most pe<b> ople </b>(of whatever race) tend to take the path of least resistance, only working just hard enough to maintain the status-quo.  A lot of the people who come to America from other countries are already of the mindset that America is a place where, if you work hard enough, you can succeed.   They are already the very rare kind of person who would do WHATEVER it takes to have a good life, as opposed to the billions of average people all over the world who die in the same relative income bracket as the one into which they were born.  Most people born into wealth stay wealthy, most people born in the middle class stay in the middle class, and most people born into poverty stay poor.  That is a tr<b> uth, </b>whatever your race/ethnicity/nationality.",

That means that even though my parents divorced and I spent most of my formative years in a single-parent household, my mom, by virtue of her sterling education, (and also the occasional bit of cronyism,) was able to secure a well-paying, 9-to-5, white collar career that enabled her to spend a lot of time with me as a kid (instead of having to work extra shifts to pay bills) and to keep us living in safe neighborhoods free of drugs and gang violence. \u00a0That means I encountered relatively few people who made me feel that I might be inherently inferior for reasons beyond my control. \u00a0That means that, even when I encountered hardship, I never assumed that the chips were stacked against me.\n\nNone of what I've said is meant to imply that I excuse criminal activity in poor communities, or condone it, or think that gang bangers, drug addicts, high school drop-outs, and/or people making too many babies when they have no way to support them are free from responsibility for their lives being shitty. \u00a0I'm just saying that it's incredibly hard to rise above that shit--especially when people are more inclined to dismiss you as worthless than to help--and most human beings lack the wherewithal to conquer that.\n\nThat's not a flawed world view, that's simpl<b> y bal</b>d realism.",

It is easier for them to blame others than to blame themselves.\"\n\nI wholeheartedly agree with you, but unfortunately, that is human nature. \u00a0That is a flaw that the vast majority of all people on this planet possess. \u00a0Been unemployed for a little too long? \u00a0It's those damn illegals taking American jobs. \u00a0Marriage failed? \u00a0It's because the ex spouse was a terrible person, not because of anything I did. \u00a0Kid shot up the school? \u00a0It's because of that satanic music and those video games, not because I was too afraid to provide boundaries and invade his \"privacy\" as a parent.\n\nComplacency and desensitization to persistent negative conditions is more noticeable in those who lead rough lives than those who lead \"comfortable\" ones. \u00a0However, self reflection and self improvement, when seen in the average person, is most often limited to very superficial things: \u00a0people go to the gym every day to maintain the outward appearance of health and well-being, but allow their important familial relationships to deteriorate into irreparable hostility. \u00a0People would rather work a reliable office job that they hate and that barely covers their cost of living than to work harder, go back to school, or take a risk in order to get a better-paying job and/or have a career that makes them happy. \u00a0Like I said before: \u00a0the path of least resistance is the path most often chosen.\n\nSomehow, though, the disdain for such a personality flaw is disproportionately directed at <b> black </b>people. \u00a0Laziness and apathy is coded into everyone's DNA, so \u00a0why when seen in poor<b>  black</b> people is it attributed solely to their blackness, rather than acknowledged as typical human weakness? \u00a0\u00a0\n\nCongratulations to you on overcoming your own personal hardship. \u00a0It certainly sounds as though you had some disadvantages, but I disagree that you can't teach someone to want to try their hardest. \u00a0Some people are going to fight for a foothold on the ladder no matter what odds they face, and others are only going to put forward the least amount of effort possible into their lives, no matter how bad things get....but mixed into those two extremes are the people who will either give up and go under or try their hardest, depending on which/how many people lift them up versus which/how many people pretend they don't matter.\n\nThere's no way to know which kind of person you're dealing with until you assess them individually.",

So to fix this :teams should have affirmative action for Asians to get pick instead of <b> African </b>Americans because of their<b>  race</b> and not their qualifications. This is ridiculous and its no different than affirmative action in schools. And people that support this stupid ideology is pushing for supposedly equal rights, HA that makes me laugh. Would you want your favorite sports team to always lose because they were filled with a bunch of Asians that got in on thei<b> r rac</b>e and not their athletic capabilities . Or would want to have a surgeon that's not to sure on how to do the operation on you because he got into med school  because of h<b> is ra</b>ce and not his qualifications. I dont think you would want either of that ,but sadly we have that going on today in schools. Its baffling how every school text books,teacher ,politicians says the program help minorities  but in actuality it only helps Latinos <b> and Afri</b>can Americans and is suppressing the smallest minority in America and that is Asian Americans. I cringe every time i learn about Affirmative action in school and they away says its to help the minorities.",

If you do it'll cost roughly \u20ac2000.\n\nI agree the<b>  black</b> society is affected more by the shitty education system in America.

            "commentText": "Nearly all of these examples of \"<b> racism\"</b> can be explained by logical and rational differences between the races\n\n1. Blacks less likely to get called back\nThe level of intelligence, criminality, time preference, and drug use are different between the races even when factoring in income and level of education. Rationally employers should choose the better candidate which would be the white one.\n\n2.<b>  Black</b> people charged $662 more for cars\nAre we to assume that this discrepancy is because they hat<b> e blac</b>k people? More than likely this is becau<b> se bla</b>ck people will accept a higher price than white people and not ask for a lower one. It's more than likely that blacks simply aren't negotiating down the price as much as white people. If this is not true and they're just pricing cars higher for blacks then why not charge the same for whites? They're a company: If they could get away with getting more money then they would.\n\n3. Blacks twice as likely to be pulled over\nWell, it's probably that blacks are more likely to break traffic laws or be in places that have higher police supervision. This is true with violent crime and drug crime so I would expect the same to be true with traffic violations.\n\n4. Blacks and whites use drugs equally but blacks more likely to be arrested\nIt is true that if you poll people on their drug use blacks and whites report equal amounts of drug use. However, if you actually test them for drugs you will find a very different story. Turns out that blacks are far, far more likely to use drugs, use them more frequently than whites, AND lie about it.\n<b> \n5. Bl</b>ack 6 times more likely to be incarcerated\nBlacks are also far more likely to commit crime. Look at the National Crime Victimization survey and you will find that when people are surveyed on the crimes committed against them they report a high leve<b> l of b</b>lack criminality. This of course is reflected in police arrests and incarceration.\n\nI haven't researched the other claims but It's likely that those too are explainable.",

Hate for the sake of hate, because that is what they have been bought up to do, in their little sheltered extended families, being home schooled with bigotry, rather than getting a well rounded understanding of the state of the world.\n\n\nAny discrimination for something the person has no control over, such<b>  as gen</b>der, skin col<b> our, se</b>xual orientation, is wrong, and its about time society woke itself up and moved into the now and stopped living in the past.",

                    "commentText": "@Christan Price Tim Wise actually brings up a good point. In my initial comment I said as a white person I am more likely than a <b> black </b>person to be the victim of interracial violence. But this was a very empty comment; what do I mean when I say \"as a white person\"? Do I mean as a member of the group of all white humans on Earth? Do I mean as a member of the group of all white Americans? Surely Swiss people, Nigerians, and white residents of Concord, New Hampshire are each barely likely at all to be the victims of interracial violence. So let me now be more precise. Between white people who frequently interact with blacks and<b>  black</b> people who frequently interact with whites, I as such a white person am significantly more likely than m<b> y blac</b>k counterpart to be the victim of interracial violence.\n\nTim Wise points out that any giv<b> en bla</b>ck American is 2.75 times more likely than a white American to be interracially murdered. This is true, but what if we redrew the lines for a moment and considered American and/or continen<b> tal Afri</b>can victims of interracial murder. Then clearly blacks would be significantly less likely to be interracially murdered as continental Africans barely experience it at all. Now if we redrew the lines again to consider American an<b> d/or Afr</b>ican and/or European victims of interracial murder, then at this point it might come out closer to equal probabilities for interracial murder. The point at which Wise's argument breaks down is the point at which he ignores the tens of millions of whites in the Midwest and in New England who don't interact with blacks at all and thus bring down the white victimhood rate down tremendously. These particular millions of whites do not<b>  have </b>black counterparts who can avoid interacting with the<b>  othe</b>r race in the same proportion. These whites might as well be on another continent, or on Mars, for all the good they do in helping us understand the problem of victimhoods.\n\nSo in my opinion the best place to really see what's going on is individual cities that hav<b> e larg</b>e black and white populations. I live in Atlanta, which is about as evenly-split as it gets. Tim Wise says I shouldn't fear that one <b> in fif</b>ty black men will do something violent in a given year, but I pass<b>  by fi</b>fty black people every day on public transport. And I have no idea what Wise is trying to prove with the W-B and B-W encounter relative percentages; it makes no sense to me. I would think that every one W-B encounter would equal one B-W encounter, so (W-B encounters) = (B-W encounters) at all ti<b> mes. S</b>o if black people and white people were equally violent, the number of W-B crimes would be equal to the number of B-W crimes, period. I have no idea why he thinks I should be pleased that <b> the ra</b>te of black on white crime isn't quite as high as he thinks it would be if only blacks were even more violent to whites to reflect how violent they are to o<b> ther b</b>lacks; black-on-white still accounts for MOST of the interracial crime, just like he says.\n\nEvery time <b> I walk</b> past a black man on the sidewalk late at night, he doesn't know me and I don't know him. There is a microscopic chance that he will be victimized by me as I pass him by. There is a microscopic chance that I will be victimized by him as he passes by. But my microscopic chance to be victimized is about 5 times worse than his. Over time you see these microscopic cross se<b> ctions</b> add up; black people are responsible for almost all the crime and violence in Atlanta, despite being only a bit over half of the residents.",

Atlanta was whiter in 1970 than it is now but it was blacker in 1990 than it is now so I don't see why you're nitpicking; it has always had a mixed character. In 1970 you'd probably be safer in a white city than in a mixed city, in 1990 you'd probably be safer in a white city than in a mixed city, and today you're probably safer in a white city than a mixed city. You might be safer in a mixed city today than a white city in 1970 but you know that's comparing apples to oranges.",

I pointed out that in each of those time periods Atlanta was whiter then than it is now and no safer for it. I've already posted the statics that showing Atlanta conforms to the trend of most violent crime being interracial and committed by people the victims knew. If you didn't want a time based comparison of safety in regards to <b> race </b>the why did you bring up?  I'm not comparing applies and oranges, I'm comparing the situations you presented in your argument which is now based almost entirely on your own assumptions which is why we are talking only about Atlanta now.",

Sure, Atlanta was a little bit whiter in 1970 and was not safer for it.

I said violent crime is and has been on sharp decline for years and that you are literally getting safer each year. YOU brought up 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 so how am I bullshitting you? I said \"almost\" all those time periods because I was accounting for the 90's but it does not detract from my point. Your argument is essentially that you will be safer in a majority white city. My point is that white or <b> black </b>it doesn't matter as highlighted by Atlanta violent crime being on the decline regardless of racial demographics and correlation between<b>  black</b> and white is irrelevant to that decline. You saying that Oakland, Detroit, and Cleveland were safer in the 70's \"because\" there were more white people in those cities is as baseless claim as me saying Atlanta is safer now because there are fewer white people.",

Prior to Bacon's Rebellion, there was no concept of white <b> race.</b> People were more concerned about<b>  nationality</b>, religion, socioeconomic status etc. White is essentially an oppressive construct that bunches up all types of different races, some with no genetic similarities other than complexion. What's also sketchy is the definition of white. White used to not encompass Italians, Irish, Eastern Europeans, and Jews, but has been changed to include these groups. To say you have pride in being white is like saying you have pride in giving up your identity for the sake of comfort. You can say you have Irish Pride, Russian Pride, Asian Pride, and various other prides based on nationalities and there wouldn't be that much conflict with that.",

I'm proud of my heritage and ancestry, not because it makes me a superior person- and it really doesn't- but because it is a part of my identity, and I am proud of who I am, and I have to be; I'm too unaccomplished as a person to pride myself on my achievements alone, so by such a narrow definition of warrant for pride, I'm not entitled to a basic, necessary and positive emotion.",

The reason why people have an issue when someone says \"I'm proud to be white\", is\u00a0 because historically being white, was never something people were told to be ashamed of. Even today blonde hair, blue eyes, and white skin is considered the epitome of beauty around the world. When someone says \"I'm proud to be <b> black\"</b> or \"proud to be Latinx\" or \"proud to be Arab\", it's because these specific groups of people are constantly told that they should not be proud of who they are. That their features are ugly and that their inferior. It's a way to try to rise above hate and discrimination and<b>  racism</b>. Not to mention \"white pride\" is typically a phrased used\u00a0 by white supremacists and neo-nazis. There doesn't need to be a \"white lives matter\" because as far as the judicial system and cops are concerned, white lives already matter. Give me one time in US history where white lives have not mattered<b> . Blac</b>k lives matter is meant to draw attention to the alarming rate of police brutality again<b> st bla</b>ck\u00a0\u00a0people, beca<b> use bl</b>ack people are more likely to be killed by police than ANY O<b> THER </b>RACE, including white people. But you are right on one thing. Whites don't go around trashing cities af<b> ter a </b>black cop kills a white person. Nope. You guys just riot over football and hockey games and pumpkin festivals.

But lets use recent events to highlight this perception of the <b> Black </b>community. The reason they are viewed differently is plastered all over the TV right now. What was the ratio of violent looters in Baltimore? There in lies the view point. Doing some simple research you will see that there were more White fatalities at the hands of the police in 2012 (most recent data) than that of Blacks. How many White riots did you see? Paying more for a car is bad negotiating, being shown less houses probably has more to do with affordability. The resume does have a point, but it goes back to the perception I mentioned earlier. Now comes the criminal aspect. As for pot, is it a percentage comparison or overall number comparison, either way it is irrelevant at this point as the numbers are altered with the legalization of. I can keep going on but hopefully you see my point. And remember when you make things out that only whites are<b>  racist</b>, it does go both ways its only reported one though.",

Whic<b> h rac</b>e was it that nearly wiped out the Native Americans, killing tens of millions all over North America, Central America, South America, The Caribbean, etc...? Oh yes, White people. You now continue your reign of terror in the Mideast, where US forces are responsible for the deaths of a million people in Iraq alone. We all are also aware of who assassinated multiple political leaders in South/Central America, and destabilized the whole region for personal gain. The absolute worst crimes in human history were committed by Whites and you still oppress and disenfranchise people even today.",

It should be noted that those neither those who conducted the studies nor Malcolm Gladwell himself, who is half Jamaican, believe that conscious <b> racism </b>is at fault for the actions of the employers and car dealers, respectively. Rather, it appears that the human brain has absorbed the information presented to it on an unconscious level and subsequently reacts differently when dealing with African-Americans as opposed to how it reacts to dealing with other races. I suggest going to the Harvard website and taking a few IATs, which test your preferences between races on an unconscious level. The author of the book, regardless of his Jamaican background, found his unconscious to be preferential towards whites over blacks, showing just how pervasive the stereotypes presented to us can be. Its a good read, particularly when paired with Victor Rios' Unpunished, in which the author shadows at risk and gang involved youth in an ethnography focused on the results of hypercriminalization in Oakland, CA. They offer a lot of insight on the topic of<b>  race</b> in America today.",

            "commentText": "As a white man, I have seen prejudice and <b> racism </b>with my own eyes. I remember I went to an interview for a dog training job at Petco. It was a group interview, consisting of me (a white man) and two other individuals (a<b>  black</b<b> > woma</b>n, and<b>  a bla</b>ck man). Both of those individuals had extensive dog training experience, and I had none whatsoever. During the interview I began to feel very insignificant and less qualified than the other two individuals. They were both professional and I was certain that either one of them would get the job before me. I could tell, however, that during the interview, the (white) interviewer seemed to be favoring me over the others, he looked at me much more, was more engaging, etc. Two days after the interview I got a call back saying that he'd like to offer me the dog training job. Wow! I mean, damn.....I felt really bad. It was quite clearly a case of prejudice, he was favoring me because I was a white male like him.\n\nAnyway, it was pretty messed up. I declined to accept the job and he sounded really disappointed. Hopefully he offered the job to one of the other candidates.\n\nPrejudice <b> and rac</b>ism exists, yes. But you have to realize that it seems to come from all gro<b> ups. Ra</b>cism is \"natural\" in the sense that humans tend to group together by likeness, the<b> re is no</b>thing wrong with this, but unfortunately in today's society we need to blend together more than we need to isolate one another.<b>  Also,</b> black people need to make a distinction <b> between</b> racism and prejudice. Often what is<b>  called</b> \"racism\" is really just mild prejudice. I doubt many people <b> are tru</b>ly racist, but many are prejudiced.\n\nAs a white man, I have been on the receiving end of prejudice. Yes, I have. For example, there is a Bangladeshi restaurant nearby that I used to go to but I don't anymore because every time I went in, the majority Bangladeshi patrons who dine there would stare at me and kind of give me this look like, \"What is this guy doing here?\" Even the staff would treat me kind of coldly while they treated the other patrons with warmth and gentility. I'm sorry, but that's prejudice. If minority groups feel like they are treated unfairly by whites, than they need to avoid treating white people unfairly when the white person is in the minority. Also, nepotism's tend to form among minority groups. Why aren't they being pressured to be more inclusive? Why is it that neighborhoods tend to break down among racial lines? The Asians congregate with the Asians, the Indians congregate with the Indians, the blacks with the blacks, etc. It's not only white people seeking their own, it's every other group as well, but yet it's white people who get all the bad rep. I have to say that Asians get very mistreated in society, blacks don't like them and Asians don't like blacks. Why aren't either of these groups under pressure to change? You see, ev<b> erybody</b> is racist, but it's only white's that we hear about. Asians discriminate against blacks all the time.<b> ....\n\n</b>Also, black people are some<b>  of the mos</b>t homophobic people in society, and it's odd to hear this group who complains about being discriminated against to then turn right around and discriminate against gays.\n\nWhite people discriminate for sure, I acknowledge that. But there's plenty of pie to go around and blame to be put on everyone, not just whites. Gandhi said \"Be the change you wish to see in the world.\" It is incum<b> bent up</b>on all ethnic groups to put down their prejudice and be the change they want to see.",

Take \" 00:30 \" for example, what are <b> \"Black</b> sounding names(...)\"? It\u00b4s not very need formulated nor is it a objective measurement.\nII. On the other hand there ia a statistic applied  @\" 00:47 \" which is very much explanatory, since one can argue, that these prices may vary from the location, time of purchasment and lastly the type of the car.\nIII. Furthermore one can argue, that the facts presented @\" 01:16 \" could be a much viable consequence the police draws from the ratio of crime in a specific (ethical)groups. Since investigation shall always correlate with the commission of crimes. Say, if more criminal cases are much more commen so should be the investigations.\nIV. Therefore is the statistic worked in @\" 01:43 \" just partly comprehensible, due to the prior made conclussion, that ethical blacks could be investigated much more frequently for a rational reason. Twice as much investigations are bound to lead to twice as much arrestments if the consumption rate of marijuan is the same, which is the case in west America and other reginal locations. Just some geograpical locations report higher arrestments regarding this very crime.\nV. \" 01:54 \" displays the very same possible deficiency I appointed to in (III).\nVI.@\" 02:11 \" is paired to (I)\n\nSo if these facts aren\u00b4t proper evidence of the existence o<b> f racis</b>m, better statistics will be! Seeing that a viable statistic shall prove in quantafied numbers that the quality of the incident and the following consequence are not coupled if compared to other ethnics.\n\nIn my opinion it\u00b4s very pivutal to always stay objective and rational.

            "commentText": "And this video explains what, exactly? Blacks are more criminally violent, hence the prison percentages. They have higher instances of drug abuse, selling, and possession, they are more likely to crash their vehicles without having purchased decent insurance, and they are more likely to treat their bodies like shit, hence why <b> doctors </b>don't really bother about the surgical warnings. I can't tell you the number of<b>  black</b> friends I've had in the past who drank so much, they developed liver disease, who smoked so much pot, they ended up in car crashes, or in the hospital, or in jail for violent crime.\n\nBlacks have a LOT of issues. Whites have a LOT of issues<b> . Rac</b>e-baiting isn't going to help. One look at Ferguson, one look at Baltimore, will tell you that. Hell, even in the 60s and 70s we ha<b> d \"ra</b>ce riots\" and \"racial tension\". This should really explain something, but let me tell you, it isn't ALL the \"White man's fault\". There NEEDS to be accountability amongst the Blacks as well, end of story. There is no excuse for burning down peoples' businesses and homes, no matter how outraged you are. That doesn't belong to you. You didn't work for it, and you didn't build it. Will you admit responsibility for it? Maybe. That would be a nice start. We're ALL guilty of something, every god d<b> amn r</b>ace on the planet. We ALL need to own up to it. And then, we all need to fucking DROP it, grow up, and learn to get along, or separate if that can't be done.\n\nEvery people on the planet deserve a homeland amongst their own, if they cannot live amongst others. I'm sure some Blacks would like that. I'm sure some Whites would like that, and no, not just for \"white supremacy's sake\", either. There are so many important issues in life. They need solved, not rebuked. Fuck sake.",

Trying to tell people to look at you equally when they already have a preconceived notion of what you should be is like trying to yell at a blue house to turn green. Our politicians need to get to the root of the problem and that's fixing the issues that reinforce those negative stereotypes. IMHO, they need to start with providing better education to the children in those areas and motivation to succeed in a career field. Unfortunately, this starts with fixing broken families before anything and it's just easier said than done. But I can tell you this much... telling people to look at minorities equally because they should won't change a damn thing.",

Furthermore the idea of outsiders being dangerous to a group is rather far fetched. You're comparing micro human behavior to a macro level of an entire population. Thats two separate fields of study! How can anybody expect our society to evolve if we're being constantly bogged down by this state of thinking?

It turns out that the decendants of the Trans Atlantic slave trade experiencing various forms of <b> racism </b>and mistreatment in this<b>  Nation</b> since its formation have a direct and critical relation to the Bible.\n\nTheir entire existence and detailed experience of servitude an<b> d racis</b>m was already documented more than 3,000 years ago with explicit accuracy. This low state and mistreatment is a Judgement for not keeping the Laws of their God.\n\nWhat th<b> is Nati</b>on and its institutions have Never done, was to truthfully tell these people who they truly are. \n\nAre t<b> hey Ne</b>gr<b> o or Col</b>ored? Are<b>  they </b>Black or Afro-American. maybe we'll just settle on African-American. \n\nNo other people on the planet have changed Nationalities from one generation to the next.\n\nAn important fact is that These people were not and ARE NOT AFRICANS, as supremest doctrine teaches.\n\nFacts is Africans did not sell Africans. The history of these people does not begin with chains, cotton fields and Slave ships.\n\nTruth is the decendants of the slave trade in this country and through out the Western Hemisphere are indeed the children of Israel. This is the True \"Am<b> erican</b> Black History\".\n\nThe only solution that will address any change for this people's will be when they awake to who they are and return to their God. The God of Israel \n\nLeviticus 17:26\nAnd I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: THEY THAT HATE YOU SHALL REIGN OVER YOU; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.",

I don't need to look up crap and search through files if the information was right there in the video. all I did was take the idea and put it under a business perspective. what you say about the \"smarter about cars thing\" doesn't relate, or rather it makes no sense at all. you almost prove my point by agreeing that a white man\u00a0can get away with purchasing a car for less than a<b>  black</b> man because they negotiate better. From the business perspective, it a car dealer can sell a car at a high price, they will go that route. If they thought that a white man is smarter about it then they would avoid that situation and go where they can increase profit. Of course that is just a business perspective of what the video says was true. If you look at the first sentence I wrote I said it was a load of crap, as in this is a lie. car dealerships don't actually purposefully sell a car at a higher price t<b> o blac</b>k people than white people. when it comes to negotiation, it is an even playing field where the price can go anywhere. for example, two white people are purchasing two of the same car, one happens to buy that car at a lower price because he got there by his means, not the dealers. I would go on to give more examples but I think you already get the point. I'm just saying that at no point do I accept the idea <b> of bla</b>ck people paying more for a car a white person can buy for less as truth. I think its propaganda that will encourage more riots over useless matters. I know you know about the riot that happened recently. A report came out that the spinal injuries that <b> the bl</b>ack guy got were pre-existing, meaning that the cops did not do anything to the guys spine. now what do all those rioters have to say for themselves? geez, this was annoyingly long and I am done with responses. for the sake of your time, and mine, don't respond to this comment.",

Hold up, what if the cops really didn't do anything to the guy? was all this destruction worth it? or is there an ulterior motive behind it? perhaps, these kids were just waiting for the slightest reasoning, real or fake, to jump all over cars and attack police and not get arrested for it. perhaps not. even so, there is another place to touch up on. why was Grey running from the cops? wouldn't a cop have to use more force to a person trying to evade him? its not really fair to say it was all the cops, or white peoples, fault. what if the cop was a<b>  black</b> man? what if thi<b> s blac</b>k cop was the one who had accidentally caused the spinal injury? no one would cry out, no one would riot. But no, it was a white cop, and the guy just so happened to have a spinal injury. Who gets blamed? the white man.",

It means that you believe that groups communally share power; apparently, the fact that some Whites are filthy rich, and that much of the power in the country is held by Whites, means that all Whites are responsible for how that power is used and shared.

I can also see that Blacks in general are engaging in self-destructive and socially-destructive behaviors that cannot end well for them.\u00a0\n\nEmployers do discriminate; actually, they must, as they cannot hire everyone. The problem is, their decisions are not based on ability, but on their own short-term self-interests, not the prospective hire's. Pay close attention to that short-term benefit mentality, as it comes up again and again when companies do something stupid.\n\nEmployers like to hire safe bets, people who will not cost much money, but produce exceptional products at low risk. That means that they don't like to hire someone they don't know, or that is <b> handicapped,</b> or that is not young, or that is too far out of the norm for their workplace. That's the safe bet for them, and it is in their own short term interest, usually, to place these safe bets. Of course, that has its own problems of stagnation, but that's another issue. Employers don't like to fix what is working sufficiently well, don't like to spend money if they don't have to, and don't like to hire anyone who might disturb the quiet operation of their shop. They don't like to train or research. They want an instant return that doesn't cost them much (or any) money. Employers want to hire 20-somethings who have advanced degrees and training and will work 100-hour weeks for poverty wages and make the company lots of money. You get them that, and it won't matter what color you are.",

Of particular interests is your sum up-\"Employers want to hire 20-somethings... ...You get them that, and it won't matter what color you are.\"-this is very far from and is only\u00a0a minute part of\u00a0the truth. Your experiences are real but you still don't have a deep grasp of how deep these issues are in America. Think about it...the data presented in this video although in commercial form is very real. The deep history of these problems are very real. There is a lady-Yolanda Spivey, I believe)\u00a0who conducted the experiment with the names regarding employment, she did the exact same thing-same credentials, different names and her made up \"white\" counterpart received way too many offers. Next a male followed suite and the exact same thing happened-he is here on Youtube.\u00a0\u00a0Because of Yolanda S. other research entities conducted the experiment and concluded the same results. Also, the first part is based on what you see-your experience that \"Blacks in general ... ...\". One can say the exact same thing about us \"whites\" as well. Especially when shown an uncut uncensored version of history, as in, how the real America was back in the day, even now. My grandparents and parents said that during their days, the racism/favoritism\u00a0was a lot more obvious, then as time\u00a0passed, it became so much more covert. So, you are amongst\u00a0the few \"whites\" that hasn't benefited that much or\u00a0at all\u00a0from privilege. But...you are talking to someone who has, many, many, many times over, with most of those times having no clue\u00a0at all!",

You are a liar.\u00a0\n\n\"Despite evidence of warfare and violent conflict in pre-Columbian North America, scholars argue that the scale and scope of Native American violence is exagerated. They contend that scholarly misrepresentation has denigrated indigenous peoples when in fact they lived together in peace and harmony. In rebutting that contention, this groundbreaking book presents clear evidence\u2014from multiple academic disciplines\u2014that indigenous populations engaged in warfare and ritual violence long before European contact. In ten well-documented and thoroughly researched chapters, fourteen leading scholars dispassionately describe sources and consequences of Amerindian warfare and violence, including ritual violence. Originally presented at an American Anthropological Association symposium, their findings construct a convincing case that bloodshed and killing have been woven into the fabric of indigenous life in North America for many centuries.\"\n [LINK] \n\n\"The presence of violent conflict and warfare is widely acknowledged throughout the Pre-Columbian Americas. A perusal of the recent literature on Pre-Columbian warfare reveals that much of the work is regionally focused or primarily concerned with the evolution of violent conflict from formative to increasingly complex societies. Lacking, however, is a dialogue on Pre-Columbian warfare that recognizes the striking parallels in certain practices\u2014captive taking, human sacrifice, warfare as statecraft, violence as ritual\u2014that occur across the hemisphere.\"\n [LINK] ",

Why don't they go to schools and help kids who need mentors or get involve with programs that stop gang violence or start up after school programs?

Thousands of identical resumes were sent out using different names, one '<b> black </b>sounding' and one 'white sounding' (seriously guys?) - OK, but which employers were they sent out to? did you send them out to the exact same employer or did some jobs that one resume was sent to inevitably have a higher number of applicants/better\nbenefit/higher salaries/more advertising than the other thereby making it an unfair test?\u00a0\n\n\n2.<b> \"black</b> people are charged roughly 700 dollars higher when buying a car.\" OK, but where are they buying the cars from? is it a fixed price? Are they buying the exact same car from the exact same dealership? If so and the sellers are seriously looking at the colour of the buyers skin and deciding there and then how much they're going to charge them despite it initially being a fixed price then that it is illegal and should promptly be reported to the authorities.\u00a0\n\n\n3<b> .\"blac</b>k drivers are twice as likely to get pulled over.\" OK, but what are they being pulled over for? Are the police\nspecifically looking into drivers windows to determine t<b> he ra</b>ce of the driver so that they can pull them over for absolutely no reason? if so what do they tell them they're being pulled over for as they're required by law to do so? If\nthey were pulled over for no reason this too should be reported as it's a misconduct on the officers part, if not and they were driving recklessly then good, they should be pulled over.\u00a0\n\n<b> \n4.\"bl</b>ack clients are shown 17.7% fewer houses for sale\" OK, but the realtor will attempt to sell the highest price house to any buyer regardless of their skin colour in order to obtain the highest commission. How were these figures obtained? Are they on the basis of the amount of houses that an equal numbe<b> r of b</b>lack and white people were shown? Did they have the same budget/price range? Where they each looking for property in the same Area? In the same time period? I very much doubt it.\u00a0<b> \n\n\n5.\"</b>black people are 4 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana use\" The reason for this one is not that police will simply let a white person off with a slap on the wrist yet ar<b> rest a</b> black person for the same crime. The reason is\nthe areas that the marijuana is being smoked in. The police will frequently patrol ghettos and rough areas in which it's no secret have a higher propor<b> tion o</b>f black people than they do white people. They shouldn't and it's sad but it's\ntrue.\u00a0<b> \n\n\n6/7</b>. \"black people are 4 times more likely to be arrested/six times more likely to be incarcerated.\" I'm sorry but they're not being arrested for no reason. Do you seriously believe that the police are witnessing white people committing\ncriminal offences and simply shrugging it off because 'hey, they're white.'? I couldn't care i<b> f they</b>'re black or white, if they've broken law then they SHOULD be incarce<b> rated.\n\n</b>8.\"Doctors did<b>  not i</b>nform black patients as often as white ones about important heart procedures.\" Did these patients have the exact same conditions and require the exact same treatment? was this conducted in the same or varying hospitals? if it's the latter which area was it conducted in? Again, where these figures taken on the basis of the exact sa<b> me amo</b>unt of black and white patients?\n\n\n9.\"white legislators did not respond as frequently to const<b> ituent</b>s with 'black sounding names'\" (Also I've met a ton a guys named Dante.) Same argument as I've used before.  Was this taken on the basis of an e<b> qual n</b>umber of black and whit<b> e cons</b>tituents. Black people are a minority in the US therefore if more white constituents reached out to <b> legisl</b>ators than black then of course when you find the statistic white constituents were responded to more frequently.  Also were they all using the same method to contact the legislators? You must also look into the urgency and content of the email/subject line (if this was the method used) instead of just assuming it's the way the sender's name sounds.<b> \n\n\n\"If </b>this isn't racism, what is?\" Umm, white people requiring higher SAT scores to get into colleges? 'Positive discrimination'? White people getting the s*it kicked out of them for having the audacity to walk in the wrong neighbourhood while wh<b> ite? Yo</b>u're right, racism ISN'T over.",

Using one source to claim tha<b> t racis</b>m is vastly apparent in the workforce of today that is over a deca<b> de o</b>ld is just plain silly and misleading.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Second, while this study seemed to support a trend towards racial discrimination in all backs, it becomes extremely difficult to truly compare their findings. We do not know just how many people the employers called as a whole, nor do we know the specifics of the resumes concerning qualifications. All we see from this article are the generalizations used in their studies and the findings they claim to have found through their methods.\n\n2) New York Times Economic Review: Racial Bias Even When We Have Good Intentions. 2015\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The author that wrote this article is the exact author from the previous source. He paired with Marianne Bertrand to co-author the 2003 Chicago Field Study. Using him in two of your sources <b> for rac</b>ism is biased. He even cited the Cardiac Catheterization from 1999 and the 2011 Yale University field experiment with state legilators\u00a0which I'll get to in a bit. The sources being used are all from the same person, this video is extremely biased in the sources it used, which destroys its credentials and credibility to someone who looks at it objectively and scientifically.

Did you click the bottom of the page where it said \"Request a copy of this article\"? No? I did not think so. You are seriously grasping for straws by assuming that somehow because \"specifics of the resumes concerning qualifications\" are not known, you can imply that this article is useless. You would have to be arguing that the study's author is hiding something, which means you've descended to the logical fallacy of the ad-hominem attack.\n\n\n2) New York Times Economic Review: Racial Bias Even When We Have Good Intentions. 2015\nThe same author was behind this and the UC Field Study? That just means that he's the only one interested in this subject of study. If you read scholarly academic papers published in prestigious journals, when trying to make a point, serious scholars will freely use more than one publication from the same author in their resources. It does not destroy credibility, at least not according to every university on earth, ever.\nOnce again, you are implying an ad-hominem attack on the study's author rather than the content of the study itself.\n\n3) Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development: Housing Discrimination Against Racial and<b>  Ethnic</b> Minorities 2012.\n\"If you read the entire article it supports that blatant discrimination, such as this video suggests, has dropped dramatically and is nearly non-existent, but some forms of indirect discrimination exist.\"\nThis just shows your lack of understanding of wha<b> t racis</b>m is. You only count blata<b> nt raci</b>sm<b>  as rac</b>ism, but the Youtube video never played by these rules. Thus you are using the logical fallacy of the straw-man argument. The video even shows that \"racial bias\" exists \"even when we have good intentions,\" meaning that unconscious bias is taken for granted by the video t<b> o be ra</b>cism. Unconscious bias is still a judgment bas<b> ed on</b> race.\n\nThe video does not suggest otherwise. The realtor is not being hostile but dismissive of the home, and does not suggest b<b> latant </b>racism. 17% racial disparity is not<b>  \"some\"</b> racism but a heck of a lot. It is pr<b> eventi</b>ng Black people from having access to assets which helps them escape from bad neighborhoods, where they dwell in, then to have white and middle-class Blacks look down on and say \"it's their culture that is causing these problems.\" So what America does is, keep 'em in the  ghetto via housing discrimination (including heavy unconscious bia<b> s on w</b>hat Black people can and cannot afford) and then condescend to them for their \"negative culture\" of the ghetto. That's so unfair.\n\n4) The Sentencing Project Uneven Justice: State rates of Incarc<b> erati</b>on <b> by Race an</b>d Ethnicity. [LINK] \n\nThis you deny with the flick of a wrist. You say it is misleading but do not back up your claim, except to vaguely say it is \"political\" issue and t<b> herefor</b>e not racist. Um, excuse me? Like there are these neat little boxes with no intersection? Look at the Department of Justice Reports for Ferguson, Miami, Newark NJ, and the other cities it investigated. The DOJ finds clear patterns of racial disparities by the police. But I bet that you have another ad-hominem attack coming for the DOJ, saying it is \"political,\" despite the fact the DOJ sided with Sanford County in the trial of George Zimmerman and Ferguson in the trial of Darren Wilson.\n\n\n5) New England Journal of Medici<b> ne: E</b>ffe<b> ct o</b>f Race and Sex on Physicians Recommendations for Cardiac Catheters. 1999\nAnother source you mysteriously don't give a detailed rebuttal to.

The elitis<b> t racis</b>t didn't want their acquaintances to think of them in the terms of those in the past who carried on that kind of ugliness, say for instance the notorious Bull Connor the bigoted former Police Commissioner of Birmingham, ALA. who set dogs and fire hoses on children and teenagers.

I don't know from which country you come from, but I'm guessing you don't come from a european country which has a \"great\" history of colonising Africa. I am, I'm French. In school we learned probably better than you what my country did and still does in Africa. I think you have no clue what colonisation really was to say that the West \"bettered\" Africa.\nTrue, there were not only downsides to it, France did a couple good things in Africa during and after the colonisation. But for the overwhelming majority of what we did, we stole natural ressources, enslaved a large portion of the population, installed and still install from time to time brutal dictatorships in the region, destroyed the economy/political stability of <b> African </b>countries who wanted to use their natural ressources to help their people, closed our eyes and to a certain extent backed up a genocide, created the<b>  racist</b> ideology (ye<b> s racis</b>m as an ideology originated from France) to justify our actions, went to war with sometimes disastrous results with countries who wanted to rebel against colonisation (c.f. Algeria), the list goes on and on.\nI'm not at all saying that as an insult, but I suggest you inform yourself on what colonisation really was. Reading a few books on the subject should make you understand why what you say is nonsenc<b> e. Afric</b>an people were a lot more happy before the colonisation and before the post-colonial era in which fascist dictatorships flourished all over Africa.",

Of course it wasn't called africa back then, but this is way after continental drift. It would only take one early hominid fossil found in any continent other than Africa to disprove this theory, but it has yet to happen. And yes, I am aware how skin colors adapted.

I actually looked them up.\n1) University of Chicago Field Study in 2003 for hiring <b> black </b>sounding names.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  [LINK] \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 First of all, this field study was done from 2001-2002\u00a0which makes it\u00a013 years<b>  old</b> when published. Using one source to claim tha<b> t racis</b>m is vastly apparent in the workforce of today that is over a deca<b> de o</b>ld is just plain silly and misleading.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Second, while this study seemed to support a trend towards racial discrimination in all backs, it becomes extremely difficult to truly compare their findings. We do not know just how many people the employers called as a whole, nor do we know the specifics of the resumes concerning qualifications. All we see from this article are the generalizations used in their studies and the findings they claim to have found through their methods.\n\n2) New York Times Economic Review: Racial Bias Even When We Have Good Intentions. 2015\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The author that wrote this article is the exact author from the previous source. He paired with Marianne Bertrand to co-author the 2003 Chicago Field Study. Using him in two of your sources <b> for rac</b>ism is biased. He even cited the Cardiac Catheterization from 1999 and the 2011 Yale University field experiment with state legilators\u00a0which I'll get to in a bit. The sources being used are all from the same person, this video is extremely biased in the sources it used, which destroys its credentials and credibility to someone who looks at it objectively and scientifically. The part in his article that I do agree with is unconsc<b> ious ra</b>cism, which is a media issue created to deepen racial divides.\n\n3) Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development: Housing Discrimination Against Racia<b> l and E</b>thnic Minorities 2012.\n [LINK] \n\u00a0This statistic pulled from the article by the video is picking and choosing. If you read the entire article it supports that blatant discrimination, such as this video suggests, has dropped dramatically and is nearly non-existent, but some forms of indirect discrimination exist.\u00a0However, to claim that all home purchasing minorities are expe<b> rience </b>racism at 17% rates is misleading without looking at the article as a whole and discussing its findings.\n\n4) The Sentencing Project Uneven Justice: State rates of Incarcera<b> tion </b>by <b> Race and E</b>thnicity.\n [LINK] \nTo simply state that blacks are incarcerated 6 times the rates of white people are is another misleading statement. This is more of a political topic in which we delve into why more crime is committed by blacks than whites, thus substantiating the statistic this video used without discussing the reasoning behind it. To simply throw it out there <b> and cla</b>im racism is ignorant and biased in and of itself.\n\n5) New England Journal of Medicine:<b>  Effe</b>ct <b> of R</b>ace and Sex on Physicians Recommendations for Cardiac Catheters. 1999\nFirst of all why are<b>  we cla</b>iming racism in 2015 by citing an article done nearly two decades ago in 1999...\nSecond, the statement th<b> e video </b>made \"doctors <b> did no</b>t inform black patients as often as white ones about an important heart procedure\" is another generalization and misleads people. Actually read the article, even though it is <b> near</b>ly 20 years old, and see how they did their study and what their findings were as a whole. Don't make a broad misleading statement to support th<b> at it\u00a0a</b>ttests to\u00a0racism today.\n\n5) Yale University Field Experiment on State Legislators.\n [LINK] \nAs stated before, the same author from this article co authored the first source, and wrote the second. Using one person as a source for at least 3 of your citations in your video completely destroys any credibility you're trying to portray. The entire video is biased, makes generalized statements without looking at actual <b> facts, </b>and claims racism today without using viable current studies.",

Also, you make a good point that two of the sources are from the same researcher, which a good thing to note, but he does have 6 sources in all which rounds out his evidence.

Only the strongest arrive to America, who usually work hard and fight their way to the top. Now it is stereotypical to think that Asians are naturally smart along with any other races that are considered extremely smart. \n\nPlease excuse me if I sounded <b> racist </b>there.",

Now don't you think your b<b> eing ra</b>cist by not standing up for the Irish emigrants who were mistreated by being slaves , come on let's see what happens when you try that . Face it all you are trying to accomplish is special treatment for blacks . And to use that on your resume to convince the world what a good person you are .
