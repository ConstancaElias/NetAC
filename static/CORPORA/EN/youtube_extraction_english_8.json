        "postText": " Studies show that when women have a preference, they would choose to have a male boss instead of a female boss. Participants in one study described their female bosses as 'emotional,' 'catty,' or 'bitchy.' Where does this aversion to female bosses come from? And why do some women seem to undercut each other at work?. . Read Olga Khazan's article\u00a0on The Atlantic for more on the psychology of queen bees: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/.... .

The research was based on 7\u00a0000 CEOs from prominent companies all over the world, and showed that women were much better in the\u00a0categories\u00a0but much fewer. Perhaps the women that go so far must be\u00a0extraordinary, but for some reason they outperformed the men.\n\nI also read a study that showed that men fought much more in the work place then women, although the perception is that women would fight more.\u00a0\n\nI'm therefore curious to why women prefer men as their bosses, is it because of the perception or is it based on some real reason to why men would serve better as their boss?",

Also wouldn't this hurt women as no consumer male or female would go to female employees and instead go to the more qualified individuals? Which would lead to more hours/overtime/sales/projects etc. for men which would lead to more pay and opportunities for advancement. \n\n\nYou want equality then put forth equal effort. This goes for women or men. You're not gonna go anywhere if you halfass anything. You shouldn't expect thing because of <b> gender,</b> but by merit.",

I have a female boss, she is the only female boss i have ever had in an industry dominated by men.  I have worked at as many as a dozen companies dues to afformentioned personality clashes.  My female boss is also the owner of her company.  She gained ownership thru investment, and not a life long work experience in the industry.  I figured when i started working here that it would be a short trip to problems because my bias was telling me that working for a female owner/boss that had no experience in the industry was going to be too difficult.......Well.    I was wrong.  She is the greatest boss I have ever had.  She tried very hard to learn from her experienced staff and uses employee feedback to not only make the working experience better, but to make the company function better.  She has enough HR sensibilities that personality clashes simply arent a thing,  i talk to her with respect.  And she does the same.  Always leading to a productive conversation.   \nThis from a man I guarantee that 95% of you feminists reading this would hate before you got to know",

These men employ women to manage everything and keep us low-level workers out of their hair. I've managed to befriend some of these \"evil female bosses\" and their stories match up: they're underpaid \"guard-dogs\" for the men who sit at the top and reap all the benefits. \nI once had a <b> woman </b>who managed our whole team and she was such a nightmare (losing our companies' contracts because of her behaviour etc.) that I went to complain to the CEO . He told me that she had free reign to do whatever she wanted so long as he could get on with his work in peace and that if I ever complained about my manager again I would be fired. \nI've also seen this families. Dads work all the time and when you see them a little on the weekends they play-fight with you and buy you an ice-cream and you think they're a hero. But Moms do all the shitty work like disciplining and cooking and cleaning with no rewards whatsoever. \nI think in a world where men did more of the shitty jobs like being a stay-at-home parent or a manager we would see that they would be just as bitchy and stressed in the same situations.",

When there is <b> gender </b>balance in colleagues female bosses are tolerable.\n\nBut when the majority of colleagues are women the queen bee comes out. Females bosses require a higher level of compliance--they can smell dissent. They use social bullying to maintain the pecking order and will relish firing you to get even for \"symbolic\" insults. Women are hyperaware of passive aggression--being late is not just a regular work politics but is a sign of contempt. Being pretty in an office of women matters more.\nMale bosses just overlook you for promotion or treat you with kid gloves. Women have to go pretty wide out of bounds to get canned by a man. Men may not respect you but are less likely to want to discuss it if you get a token amount of work done. The status quo floats with male bosses, doesnt with female.",

Wrong!\nThese justifications are way off of reality and are extremely non-scientific and illogical. \n   Male bosses are better bosses for the most part because women are:\n 1. Afraid to delegate power while willing to delegate responsibility.(Leading to frustrated employees)\n2. Fundamentally raised either to have very very low real self confidence or paradoxically, to be very un empathetic as a compensation.\n  \nThere is 1 (ONE) way to fix this.\nMothers, fathers, older siblings, teachers. \n-    Be Honest with girls so that they learn to believe and trust in mentors and in themselves.\n\n-  Allow girls to be angry and to speak their mind and teach them to listen and be empathetic(Not just sympathetic)\n\nFundamentally, women in society are very early conditioned to believe that they are not responsible outside of for their children. Teach you daughters to take reaponsibility on a large scale and give them the tools to actually complete.  If they say 'I'm tired, bored ', etc, remind them that there are people who will depend on them in the future. Their country needs them, their world needs them.

They are irrational; they hate without having solid arguments and prefer without having solid arguments\n\n2. You never know what they think. They talk one thing,think another thing, do the third thing.\n\n3. They are emotionally unstable. One day they are sweet, next day,without reason,they turn into bitter monsters. So you never know what to expect.\n\n4. They don't know how or don't want to make boundaries between private relationships and professional relationships. It is always mixed in women's mind. They make too close friendships with Several people,employees, and then turn those connections into own clan against the other workers.\n\n5. They are backstabbing and gossip a lot.\n\n6. They complain too much, about everything.\n\n7. They never defend their workers in case of some problem, but enjoy to devalue them,even before being sure about their responsibility for that mistake.\n\n8. They are very poor team workers, they always want to be on the top and not to cooperate\n\n9. They often work much less than they claim they do\n\n10. They are lovely when they talk to you, but just one second later when you turn off your back, they change the story and use whatever you said against you.\n\nSo...yes,I rather prefer male bosses. Some of them are  good and some of them are bad. But they are Defined and you at least can always know what to expect.",

My friends ex was like you, hated other women cause of their bitchiness and would only make male friends. Said she enjoyed herself more around us. Women always blame the man for treating them bad and call them pricks and such but they dont realise men will treat everybody the way they treat them. If your trying to control everything, moaning all the time, demanding and spending all the  money on shit then eventually the guy is going to start disliking you. Imagine a flatmate was doing that to you? Youd go off them quick. My ex accused me of being controlling and treating her like shit. I never kept her in the house, told her how to dress, who to talk to, none of those things. It was her who used to do that to me. Projection. She was the contro<b> l frea</b>k. It's that total disregard of reality which makes a lot of women insufferable",

Then I expected her to prove or at least show rationally that this is not the right way of thinking. Then she precedes to bring up a new premise that she likes more because it implies a totally different social structure that she prefers to believe in. Now if she proved why this should be the correct way of thinking i would agree with her but again there's no reason why her premise is more valid than the usual premise.\nThis whole video is just one big logical proof fallacy. I hope people don't just take what she's saying at face value",

EVERY experience (with one exception) that I've had working for women or in a team comprised mostly of women has been an absolute, unmitigated disaster. The micromanaging, two-faced, backstabbing, catty, bitchy nastiness and bullying have been unprecedented. And the pettiness over stupid, nonsensical things! During a job search last year, as soon as a headhunter told me the manager was a <b> woman,</b> I told them NO WAY, I am not interested. I won't even waste my time.  I've had a couple of male managers who were jerks, but by and large, all the men I worked for were pretty easy and straightforward to deal with. Do the work, do it well, deliver in a timely manner, ensure the stakeholders are satisfied and all is fine. NEVER had any issues. THAT is how it should be!",

A female boss is more likely to gaslight them and add to the drama rather than stamp it out or be immune to it the way perceive men to be. \n\nThey tell me that they can joke around and be friendly and feel more secure in their emotional expressions around a male boss because they know he will not overanalyze them and create drama out of it. They feel as if Men act more like emotional buffers, they can be themselves around us without worrying about a bitchy attitude and they know that if a male boss is being bitchy it is almost never personal because men get pissed off at impersonal circumstances and abstract concepts whereas female bosses get pissed off at people and seek to put a face to the problem rather than work to solve it. \n\nOne female employee told me: \"I feel as though I can lash out and you won't give a fuck and just brush it off even though I'm gonna be feeling guilty latter but I just can't do that with a female boss. I just feel like I can be myself around men without all the hostility and drama.\"\n\nAnd that is the most <b> common </b>answer I hear from women. They say that they don't feel that tension with a Male boss that they get from a female boss. They feel like they can be themselves and not have their guard up all the time and they don't have to walk on eggshells. One girl even said \"I just feel more free.\"",

The trouble is the majority of women, especially in this country these days are immature. They grow up spoiled rotten, but don't grow up mentally into mature women.

They have an endless sense of entitlement with big egos and they bring all that mess into the workplace. Yet somehow, women are put on this always put on this pedestal of being more mature than men, meanwhile they act just the opposite. Furthermore, society constantly enables this behavior. This isn't about men trying to keep women down in any way, shape or form. This is about the fact that women bring female logic into the way they do things instead of real logic. They think in terms of almost quite literally, it's my way or the highway. Also, immature women seem to get more respect than mature women do.",

What we want to do is make it harder for women to be overlooked or otherwise discriminated against due to their being women.\n\nMaking it easier for women to progress in business focuses primarily on the <b> woman'</b>s being a<b>  woman</b>, and secondarily upon her skills and talents. That will actually hurt th<b> e woma</b>n herself, as soon as she detects her womanness as a major factor in her progress. What we want to do is focus, perhaps even more intensely for women than for men, in making sure women have as much freedom and resources as possible to acquire skill and talent. To give them that freedom likely will require us to call it out, to focus more on calling women forth than we would tend to call men forth. This is not a hard and fast rule, but a principle to be applied to all humans, regardless of the<b> ir s</b>ex. A male who, for whatever reason tends to lack assertiveness but who has inherent qualities that can be nurtured, should get the same treatment, being called forth so that his skill and talents can be developed.\n\nWhen I se<b> e a wo</b>man who has that special indescribable something that signals inherent quality, then, as a leader, I consider it an obligation to decency to go out of my way to make <b> sure not</b>hing gets in the way of helping her qualities develop and flourish. In fact, I have an obligation to go out of my way to call forth those qualities, to let everyone else begin to see them, and even to help me call them forth. It won't do to create the mythical \"level playing field\" in her case because the field has been built agains<b> t he</b>r sex for the past 50,000 years. I understand that many guys will reject this. But those same guys, when faced <b> with a</b> woman, especially a<b>  prett</b>y woman, will generally begin responding to her firstly, based on th<b> eir bas</b>e sexual impulses and not bas<b> ed on </b>the woman's talents and skill. I have seen this a thousand times, even in myself.\n\nIt is important to me that I vigorously crucify my tende<b> ncy tow</b>ard sexual response, to instead favor my tendency to appreciate the potential benefits of skill and talent that any<b>  parti</b>cular woman might present. I have an obligation to do this not only for the development of those in my charge, but also for shareholders and for the health of the enterprise in general. There is <b> a domai</b>n for sexual dynamics and expression. That domain does not include the progress of employees and development of enterprises - perhaps unless we are dealing with brothels.",

When men compete you'll be able to see and hear it and it's much more pronounced, however, in the case of women competing is a much more subtle art.",

            "commentText": "No the problem is that women for the most part are insecure and do see other women as competition not as a cohort. Not all but MOST. Regardless of <b> race </b>and background. For one, most if not a ton of women rather take the easy way out or like to be comfortable in jobs. A<b>  woman</b> boss will find it awkward to give easier jobs to <b> a woma</b>n unless she needed it (pregnancy, health, familial responsibilities). Two, a lot of women do like to do a bit of power play by manipulation. And men are easier to manipulate if they find you attractive. If the boss is attractive the women will feel intimidated and try to \"dethrone\" her. Most women feel comfortable working with<b>  a wom</b>an on the same level  as her. If she's too attractive they'll ostracize her. It's sad but true. Though high maintenance female bosses are truly awful. More often than not the female bosses that wear too much makeup and dress too sexily have very likely slept their way to the top. No I don't mean fashionably elegant bosses. You learn to tell the difference fast. I hate to say it, but insecure women are their own worst enemies. I must say that my best bosses were women, by far. They were tough, astute, loving, fun and hard-working. They always pushed me to be my best. Always had good advice and always looked to reward and promote me when I did great. And provided tips and adequate advice. They were also confident, and I truly think this is the key. Women are always told we could always improve when we are good enough. This is what leads to problems when an insecure female meets a self assured one. \n\nMy worst bosses so far have been men, older men in particular. Maybe it is because I'm at the beginning of my 20s and not unattractive. They give unwanted attention and get offended if you don't look at them<b>  as sex</b>ual partner material. The supervisors try to one up another to see who gets the largest body count. They get frustrated when I don't do it up or dress up for them like a lot of female co-workers do to get certain favors. They also feel less than. Male co-workers might be fun when I'm older since they'll be less likely to see me as a poten<b> tial</b> sex partner. They really care <b> abou</b>t age more than  anything I'm noting. And that's always a nice feeling since you can relax at work and not fight or deal with the gossiping co-workers. There's less tension.",

Even today, most home interiors will be chosen by women and very rarely all women share <b> common </b>taste. \nWomen entered the educated supersensitive yet safe work space only after industrialization. In this short period of a few decades, it's less likely to remove the instinct to follow the confident male and trust on the confident female. Moreover, the risk analysis done by a male CEO will be in more depth and inclusive of minor market disturbances as compared to female CEOs.\nOnly the long term analysis can say the outcome given by a confident male and a confident female.",

Men use logic to make decisions and are able to remove themselves from circumstances and not take things personal.  These are important qualities for leaders to have.  We don't have numerous female leaders because most women inherently lack the qualities that a strong leader needs.  And to answer the repeated question that gets brought up to justify propaganda like this, there aren't many female CEOs because either women choose to not have those positions or they were not a good fit.  Your suggestion is lowering the standards for women? To equalize the numbers no doubt. Preposterous.  Equal outcome is not equal opportunity. We need strong leaders leading.",

They do not care about your growth, do not care about the productivity or the company. All they care about is how well you substantiate their opinions and how well you are able to toil away as their slave. \nIn fact, I once remember when my female boss asked me to manually compare 2 excel lists and point out the differences. I did it using a function in excel which my boss was not very happy with (because she hates to admit that I knew something that she didnt). She started telling me how the function was not accurate and why there is a reason it is to be done manually. There was a subtle hint of threat in her politeness which I understood at once. Something which I had never faced with a male boss or professor.\nInfact, the best way to succeed with a female boss is to treat her like a supreme leader of a totalitarian regime. Just try it out and see how much she ends up loving you.",

            "commentText": "@3:04 of the video, the feminist agenda is exposed...\"we can make it easier for women to break through to the top\".  Hasn't the equality and affirmative action programs already accomplished this ? Women now out number men as college graduates, as there are numerous programs to assist women in obtaining their degree and being hired for jobs.  To say that is the work environment that has made women \"bitchy\" or more ruthless in order to get ahead is also feminist BS !\n\nWomen by nature are narcissistic, they have a need to attention and they will compete for attention, especially against other women. Women do not compete the same as men in the workplace, as men compete by working to acquire new knowledge and working hard to implement improvements at the company to increase revenue or decrease costs. Women compete by means of the \"office politics\", gossiping to ruin the good reputation of another co-worker (<b> woman </b>or man), back-stabbing, forming alliances to undermine another co-worker (only to later turn on those she was aligned with) and stealing others ideas and work.  I have worked at companies where the majority of management positions were staffed by women and these companies were extreme toxic environments that felt more like being in an episode of survivor island than a workplace. Most women just do not have the leadership traits that men posses, such as being the one to take the blame for the failures of their team. Women tend to place the blame on the members of the team, not on herself.",

The new young supervisor, whom we trained from scratch, suddenly became our boss. She was like a fascist dictator who repeatedly bullied and undermined us. You can't justify that by claiming it was because of a male-dominated workplace with few opportunities for women.\nI was a male secretary/administrative assistant in an extremely female dominated profession for 26 years. My supervisors/immediate bosses were almost always women. Specifically, b<b> y ag</b>e group/nationality/gender/orientation, U.S. American heterosexual women in their late 20s through mid-30s are the worst of the worst of the worst to work for. Sit back, relax, and watch women (under t<b> he a</b>ge of 40 especially) make employees hate them. I've been through this too many times. Women bosses and supervisors, especially under <b> the </b>age of 40, have a well-deserved bad reputation.",

                    "commentText": "@ Roger A. Mueller - This video has \"feminist\" and \"blame the patriarchal system and toxic masculinity\" encoded throughout.  @3:04 of the video, the feminist agenda is exposed...\"we can make it easier for women to break through to the top\".  Hasn't the equality and affirmative action programs already accomplished this ? Women now out number men as college graduates, as there are numerous programs to assist women in obtaining their degree and being hired for jobs.  To say that it is the work environment that has made women \"bitchy\" or more ruthless in order to get ahead is also feminist BS !\n\nWomen by nature are narcissistic, they have a need to attention and they will compete for attention, especially against other women. Women do not compete the same as men in the workplace, as men compete by working to acquire new knowledge and working hard to implement improvements at the company to increase revenue or decrease costs. Women compete by means of the \"office politics\", gossiping to ruin the good reputation of another co-worker (<b> woman </b>or man), back-stabbing, forming alliances to undermine another co-worker (only to later turn on those she was aligned with) and stealing others ideas and work.  I have worked at companies where the majority of management positions were staffed by women and these companies were extreme toxic environments that felt more like being in an episode of survivor island than a workplace. Most women just do not have the leadership traits that men posses, such as being the one to take the blame for the failures of their team. Women tend to place the blame on the members of the team, not on herself.",

In the process of making it easier for women, will it be justified that we throw away some men who were just more qualified than those women who went to top but had it harder than women?",

Whilst working for men i have found that they tend to get on better with their staff be it M or F, a more relaxed and forgiving work ethic, whilst trying to employ a sense of humour and banter as part of their working relationships with their staff",

She would often yell at me *YOU'VE GOTTA START MULTITASKING!!!! or ANSWER YES OR NO!!! or YOU'RE GETTING BEHIND!!!*. She insulted me regularly. I eventually had to leave that place because of her bullying, and I think she drove me away deliberately. I hope my eyes will never see her again",

People with high IQs normally aren't social creatures they rather be alone and away from people. If our world leaders were geniuses then a lot of wars wouldn't have happen and I'm sure our earth wouldn't be so polluted. People with high IQs think beyond the general public and tend to think less with emotions which results in them always looking at the bigger picture.",

Historically both sexes have been thoroughly oppressed by a rich upper class that decided everyone's fate. Most men would have been prepared to give their lives to save their wives and children because women and children were seen as more important than men were. Men have historically been <b> nothing </b>more than cannon fodder while women were also oppressed as they were seen as little more than baby making machines. \n\nHOWEVER, biologically speaking, men ARE worth less than women (just as 1 trillion sperm is needed to fertilize one single egg), and womens primary function IS to make babies so perhaps biology has been the cause of societal ills all this time.",

I think there should be clear and measurable actions that should be recommended based on the person. \n\nI personally don't see how i can make it easier for women to break through to the top considering my position at my company. Would love to see more follow ups, nice video Olga.",

Lots of self haters, hypocrites, dramatic projection and super lonely people sharing hateful anecdotes. What really sucks is how they are all forgetting that by calling women bitches and/or banshees, etc..., only exemplifies or fulfills this insane narrative.  Not understanding how basic reaction and response works, allows a self conscious woman's ignorance to fly at full mass. The women bosses can't simply be remembered as poor managers or lacking in professional communication skills; rather they must all be expressed in ways that says only a female (boss) would treat subordinates wrong or unkindly.  I wish it was only an urban legend, but I have no doubt that the men's 1000+ years of a head start on being the boss, has placed all women in the position of constantly playing catch-up and  having to learn roughly 1000+ years worth of info by time their first boss job starts.",

We are all born with certain genetic characteristics that help us to perform in life. \n\nIf men and women were truly equal and women merely needed to catch up, what caused women to fall behind in the first place? It's ridiculous and completely forgets the natural biological differences between the sexes that accounted for the original divisions of labor (when work meant pulling a ox around a field by hand, or felling giant trees, men simply WERE better due to superior physical strength). Today most jobs don't require physical labor but the ones that do, and especially the more dangerous kind, are still, largely dominated by men which likewise accounts for mens overall higher pay than women.",

Often I have to make a conscious effort to not discount what some some people (not just women) are saying, depending on their voice tone and \"accent\" (\"Valley girl\" variations, \"surfer bro\", for men). And sometimes the contrast of the content with the \"delivery\" is even somewhat perplexing, almost comedic (picture an \"Einstein\" Kim Kardashian, or a male astrophysicist that starts phrases with \"dude\" and punctuates with \"like\"). \n\nHigher pitched voices tend to create a nearly constant disadvantage for women in this kind of thing, as they're inherently more child-like, and children are naturally \"hierarchically inferior\" in intellectual respectability. So women end up having to make an extra effort in diction, to sound more serious and competent. Geena Davis said in some movie something along the lines of not make every statement sound like a question.\n\nMen's disadvantage in this regard is that their voices will be deeper and less comforting, always more associated with something \"aggressive\", so, as machines continue to replace the types of manual labor that employ most men, they'll have a harder time competing agasint women in stereotypically feminine/human-nurturing areas.",

Women have a wider range of colour recognition, but men are better at picking out smaller details and detecting movement. Neither has \"better eyesight,\" they are just specialised in different ways.\n\n\"they live longer\" - Not for biological reasons. Women live longer because they are defended by the males of our species, who are statistically more likely to die a violent death, rather than live long enough to die by natural causes.\nOur society invests far more resources into women's health than men's health. Women are also more likely to be concerned with personal health and as such they will catch illnesses earlier, when they are more easily treatable.\n\n\"have more balance\" - They have a lower centre of gravity due to a wider pelvis. This does not equate to \"more balance.\"\n\n\"they have stronger immune systems\" - Incorrect. I refer you to the fact that society places a greater value on the health of women and the fact that women are more likely to seek medical attention.\nMen are actually statistically less likely to get ill, but suffer more for it for shorter periods. This is because the male immune system reacts more violently and dedicates more energy into fighting off illness so that they can recover more quickly. From an evolutionary perspective, this is because the males of our species don't have anyone to protect them and as such can't afford long periods of illness in which they are unable to feed themselves.",

It's not that men bash each other with chairs when they have a problem, but one will go to the other to see what the problem is.\n\n  Women tend to avoid conflict and competition, so they'll never say what's wrong to the person they have a problem with.  They'll be passive aggressive and spread rumors about the person their mad about to everyone else.\n\n  This is why the divorce rate is so high, women can not communicate like an adult male.

You're most likely expecting women not to be in a position of power, so when they behave like bosses it comes off as bitchy. But a man is expected to be a boss, so his behavior is seen as easy going.",

Many younger women like her because she is a natural leader a real mother figure. But other less talented women hate her and pretend to be her friend only to stab her in the back. She now has trouble trusting women, whereas men have always helped her. She could write reams on the cattiness of women. And she is not the only <b> woman </b>who told me that a few other have also. I learned a lot from her about how crooked females can be. Don't believe all that feminist mythology about the moral superiority of women. Schopenhauer was mostly right when it came to females. Are their good women, fortunately yes there are, my grandmother, mother and wife are examples to me of decent, noble women. But my mistake was to think that all women were like my mother and grandmother, they are not. I learned the hard way.",

(I'm not condoning it, in fact I down right hate it, but it has been observed in countless psychological studies.) It just seems incredibly contrived to take this idea of dismissing any kind of personal responsibility for women in a position of power. It also seems strange that your trying to argue that these \"bitchy queen bee's\" are somehow \"persecuted\" and being made to do what they're doing, because they're all somehow \"internalising the<b>  gender</b> stereotype\", and so completely innocent of any abuse of power they may carry out. No matter who you are, wha<b> t ethnicit</b>y you are, or wh<b> at gend</b>er you are, everyone should be held accountable for their actions with NO exceptions. That is true equality.\n\nPS: Just to clarify to anyone wondering, I'm not one of those worthless anti-feminists, but I'm not supportive of those nonsensical feminazis. I support the level headed and openminded feminists, who actually understand what they're talking about and are only asking for true social equality.",

I didn't have much the interpretation that the bitchy behavior is then \"excused\", because \"she's also a victim\", though. Other possible factor may be that female bosses will even treat female employees in a more egalitarian fashion, whereas perhaps male bosses would be inclined to cut them some slack in order to not be perceived as sexist. \n\nBut male bosses can possibly even be more malleable, more susceptible to women's requests in a nearly \"biological\" way, either in some sort of unconscious behavior of either \"courtship\" or provider, whereas female bosses don't have these brain buttons to be triggered, or are more conscious of not creating the appearance of unfairly favoring women, possibly even overcompensating.\n\nI'm not sure the \"we should make it easier for women\" is a good solution, if by \"easier\" it's meant \"easier than for a man\". I think it will only reinforce the view of \"tokenism\", of women/minorities being put there just in the name of diversity, favored over others with higher competence.",

This combined with the fact that women are more affected by negative emotion is one of the reasons why women prefer male bosses rather than female bosses. Women also tend to display aggression in a different way than men do; usually by name-calling or other verbal ways rather than physical aggression. This is why women report their bosses as being more hostile than male bosses - their disagreeable nature (compared to the average female) combined with a greater susceptibility towards negative emotion and a different way of displaying aggression causes many to prefer male bosses rather than female bosses.",
