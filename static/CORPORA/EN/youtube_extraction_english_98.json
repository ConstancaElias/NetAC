But according to new findings, these characteristics\u2014and any other traits suggesting that the lady isn't particularly alert\u2014are precisely what the human male has evolved to look for in a one-night-stand. In an article soon to be published in Evolution and Human Behavior, University of Texas--Austin graduate student Cari Goetz and her colleagues explored what they called the sexual exploitability hypothesis...'. Ana Kasparian, Cenk Uygur, and Steve Oh discuss on The Young Turks. Read more here from Jesse Bering on Slate: http://www.slate.com/articles/health_...

But this study is invalid because it states that, \" A man would be looking for a women to spread his seed. The false assumption is by that very statement, firstly a man wouldn't want to spread his seed to such a women in this day in <b> age.</b> He would only want to have intercourse with her and sense she 'appears' to be unintelligent she would be the best target. Also my question to the person who createdd such a false assuption would be this, \"How would you tell if a women was intelligent or not by just looking at her instead of having a conversation?\" Also pictures in the way women appear to look unwitty could also not be validated unless she were to be tested. Eiether way all men are pretty diffrent and such an assuption between apperance compared to intelligence is invalid and a women cant appear to be unwitty yet you chat with her and could tell.",

The general point that I'm trying to make is that evolutionary biology sometimes mixes up nature & culture. Often, EBists assume that culturally ingrained behavior is hard wired. I find this topic fascinating and reading <b> Sex </b>at Dawn really opened my mind to new ways of looking at things. I highly recommend it.",

Therefore females are required to be more selective when choosing mates than males.

Yes, the study seems flawed, assuming what they are saying is true, but humans NEVER shared mates the way bonobos do. One merely has to look at modern hunter-gatherer tribes. We are, by nature, serial monogamists. I would suggest \"The Moral Animal\" by Robert Wright as an accessible book for the layman to read up on such subjects.",

Why, then, should something ELSE being traditional automatically validate it in your eyes? Personally I'm more concerned with what's right and scientifically accurate than tradition.",
