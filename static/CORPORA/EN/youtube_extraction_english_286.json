She also voted to give the families of <b> terrorist </b>life insurance in 2017. I thought for sure that all gov, officals would be fully vetted but clearly they are not. Why has it been made so difficult to remove a body from office when it's been found that they have broken the law?  All high profile positions in gov, should require being a natural born citizen to even qualify to run for them.There is a good reason a President is required to be a natural born citizen, that same reasoning should follow suit in other positions. It appears we have had politicans over the years recieving a lot of money from cartels to keep open area's along the south border. Other wise there wouldn't be hundreds of miles of open border allowing drugs, human trafficing and illegal aliens from all over the world to enter our country.<b>  Common</b> sence  tells us we still have politicans funded by the cartels, causing innocent lives lost,  the families of those victims lives forever destroyed, drug addicts galor, countless of thousands missing children,raped over and over again only to be sacraficed. Putting a uncalled for strain on our economy costing billions of dollars a month. All just so these politicans can get  even more wealthy than they already are. And the people of this grea<b> t natio</b>n have no choice but to pay these dreadful peoples salary,  we can't even get them out of office when they should all be in jail!  President Trumpis right, our government is broken, that swamp must be drained. The voter fraud is so bad, our votes our voice is at stake. Any idea's before t<b> he communi</b>st censore us to!?",

            "commentText": "How can you call her anti-Semitic? She is likely more Semitic than Netenyahu. The bible says the devil will deceive the world. First of all Semitic is not a group of people it is a family of languages indigenous to Africa. Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, Tegri, and about 400 others spoken Africa.\r\nThe Zionists rule our country and have infiltrated the Christian Church. Any bible scholar knows the Jews are descendants from the European Kazarian Kingdom. In 740 AD they converted to Judaism under King Bulan. For hundreds of years they ruled a region between the Caspian and <b> Black </b>Sea. They converted to Judaism the same way Donald Trump's daughter did. These imposters have no genetic, historical, or archeological connections to the Biblical Hebrews. \r\nThe Christian church remains silent because if these European imposters are exposed; then people will ask who and where are the Hebrew Israelites.\r\nFirst of all they would look like Rep. Omar. The biblical Hebrews were Negros. Israel is in Africa despite attempts to redefine it as the middle east. \r\nMoses was raised as Pharaohs Grandson and all the Pharaoh's of that era were Negros. Pharaoh had order the murder of all Hebrew baby boys of Moses<b>  age</b>. Their was no physical differences between Hebrews, Egyptian, and Ethiopian people. When Moses true identity was discovered he fled into the wilderness. While resting at the well he helped the Shepard girls water their flock. When they return home early their father ask them, \" how is it you are back home so soon\". They answered an Egyptian helped us. They thought he was Egyptian because Moses fled with the clothes on his back. He was still wearing Egyptian clothes. Moses married an Ethiopia<b> n woma</b>n. King Salomon and Sheba first born son Maliki became the first King of Ethiopia. \r\nEuropean were desperate to white wash history. For this lie to work they had to make the Egyptians and the Israelites white. This served the Kazarian European Jews and the Christian church. In many European countries that were not invested in the exploitation of Africa and it's people; you fi<b> nd Bla</b>ck Madonna and Messiah.\r\nThe Catholic Church decided to change the image of the Messiah. Pope Alexander VI commission a new European image of the Messiah. It was a big deal so a heated competition between DaVinci and Michelangelo ended with DaVinci winning the contract because he was rumored to be the lover of the Pope's son Cesare Borgia. The image of the Christ that is on a billion pictures is <b> the<b>  </b</b>>gay son of Pope Alexander. \r\nWhy would the Hebrew people ever go to Europe. When threatened they always fled to Egypt and when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans they fled in to south and west Africa where you can find the tribes today. These Africans pass the Genetic test and they still follow Hebrew traditions. \r\nThe very first maps of Africa commissioned by European Kings shows a section of West Africa called the Kingdom of Judah. Now this is where the story gets interesting. When the slave trade started we are told <b> other Af</b>rican sold<b>  other A</b>frican tribes into slavery. The truth that will shatter all we know today is the first slaves brought to the Western Hemisphere were the tribe of Judah. Yes, the hated blacks of the America's are directly decendant of the tribe of Judah.\r\nThe imposter Netenyahu stood before Congress claming Moses led his people, but Moses never went to Poland. Netenyahu whose real name was Millenkosky before his father changed it to sound Hebrew.\r\nSome say they are our allies. I need only point out how they have spied on us for decades and then sold those secrets to our strategic enemies. Russia received the bulk of these secrets in exchange for allowing more Jews to immigrate to Israel.\r\nDuring the Iraq war they were caught trying to steal secrets about our troop placements in Iraq. Intending to assist insurgents kill American troops. Even more dramatic was the 1967 attack on the USS LIBERTY. They made every attempt to sink this ship and blame it on the Egyptians during the Arab Israeli war. The ship was clearly American and many sailors lost their lives as the Israeli Airforce and Navy mercilessly killed many American sailors.\r\nIf you are an American patriot you can not stand by and let this foreign power use us for their evil goals.\r\nJerrod Kushner is a traitor and he is setting us up for conflict with every country around Israel. Iraq, Libya, Iran, Syria must be destroyed and they used ISIS and American to do it. ISIS has attacked Christians and MUSLIMS; but never Israel and no one seems to think something is strange abo<b> ut this te</b>rrorist organization never throwing even one pebble at Israel but swear war on everyone else.\r\nIf you are a Christian please realize they use your love of Jesus to manipulate American politics.\r\nAlso realize Jesus was not the Messiah name and the bible clearly predicted this great identity theft. Revelations 2:9 and 3:9 clearly calls these people as the synagogue of Satan.",

                    "commentText": "He called and over a million <b> black </b>men showed up.\nHow can you call her anti-Semitic? She is likely more Semitic than Netenyahu. The bible says the devil will deceive the world. First of all Semitic is not a group of people it is a family of languages indigenous to Africa. Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, Tegri, and about 400 others spoken Africa.\r\nThe Zionists rule our country and have infiltrated the Christian Church. Any bible scholar knows the Jews are descendants from the European Kazarian Kingdom. In 740 AD they converted to Judaism under King Bulan. For hundreds of years they ruled a region between the Caspian and<b>  Black</b> Sea. They converted to Judaism the same way Donald Trump's daughter did. These imposters have no genetic, historical, or archeological connections to the Biblical Hebrews. \r\nThe Christian church remains silent because if these European imposters are exposed; then people will ask who and where are the Hebrew Israelites.\r\nFirst of all they would look like Rep. Omar. The biblical Hebrews were Negros. Israel is in Africa despite attempts to redefine it as the middle east. \r\nMoses was raised as Pharaohs Grandson and all the Pharaoh's of that era were Negros. Pharaoh had order the murder of all Hebrew baby boys of Mose<b> s ag</b>e. Their was no physical differences between Hebrews, Egyptian, and Ethiopian people. When Moses true identity was discovered he fled into the wilderness. While resting at the well he helped the Shepard girls water their flock. When they return home early their father ask them, \" how is it you are back home so soon\". They answered an Egyptian helped us. They thought he was Egyptian because Moses fled with the clothes on his back. He was still wearing Egyptian clothes. Moses married an Ethiopi<b> an wom</b>an. King Salomon and Sheba first born son Maliki became the first King of Ethiopia. \r\nEuropean were desperate to white wash history. For this lie to work they had to make the Egyptians and the Israelites white. This served the Kazarian European Jews and the Christian church. In many European countries that were not invested in the exploitation of Africa and it's people; you f<b> ind Bl</b>ack Madonna and Messiah.\r\nThe Catholic Church decided to change the image of the Messiah. Pope Alexander VI commission a new European image of the Messiah. It was a big deal so a heated competition between DaVinci and Michelangelo ended with DaVinci winning the contract because he was rumored to be the lover of the Pope's son Cesare Borgia. The image of the Christ that is on a billion pictures is<b>  th<b> e</b</b>> gay son of Pope Alexander. \r\nWhy would the Hebrew people ever go to Europe. When threatened they always fled to Egypt and when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans they fled in to south and west Africa where you can find the tribes today. These Africans pass the Genetic test and they still follow Hebrew traditions. \r\nThe very first maps of Africa commissioned by European Kings shows a section of West Africa called the Kingdom of Judah. Now this is where the story gets interesting. When the slave trade started we are told<b>  other A</b>frican sol<b> d other </b>African tribes into slavery. The truth that will shatter all we know today is the first slaves brought to the Western Hemisphere were the tribe of Judah. Yes, the hated blacks of the America's are directly decendant of the tribe of Judah.\r\nThe imposter Netenyahu stood before Congress claming Moses led his people, but Moses never went to Poland. Netenyahu whose real name was Millenkosky before his father changed it to sound Hebrew.\r\nSome say they are our allies. I need only point out how they have spied on us for decades and then sold those secrets to our strategic enemies. Russia received the bulk of these secrets in exchange for allowing more Jews to immigrate to Israel.\r\nDuring the Iraq war they were caught trying to steal secrets about our troop placements in Iraq. Intending to assist insurgents kill American troops. Even more dramatic was the 1967 attack on the USS LIBERTY. They made every attempt to sink this ship and blame it on the Egyptians during the Arab Israeli war. The ship was clearly American and many sailors lost their lives as the Israeli Airforce and Navy mercilessly killed many American sailors.\r\nIf you are an American patriot you can not stand by and let this foreign power use us for their evil goals.\r\nJerrod Kushner is a traitor and he is setting us up for conflict with every country around Israel. Iraq, Libya, Iran, Syria must be destroyed and they used ISIS and American to do it. ISIS has attacked Christians and MUSLIMS; but never Israel and no one seems to think something is strange ab<b> out this t</b>errorist organization never throwing even one pebble at Israel but swear war on everyone else.\r\nIf you are a Christian please realize they use your love of Jesus to manipulate American politics.\r\nAlso realize Jesus was not the Messiah name and the bible clearly predicted this great identity theft. Revelations 2:9 and 3:9 clearly calls these people as the synagogue of Satan.",

I am sorry if you feel put down by my comments but I am tired of this lie. European Jews are not semetic. They are certainly decendants of the Kazarian Kingdom. They are converts that stole the identity of the true Hebrews. The true Hebrews are coming to an end of their second captivity. Yah is waking up the true Hebrews. Deep down in our genetics was embedded a wake up call. The bible says the Hebrew people would forget who they are. Does that sound like the Jews today. The bible says they will be slaves again after the Egyptian captivity. This is not going to be accepted by the church because the church white washed it's history to promote white supremacy. Europeans could not reveal that the Biblical icons including the Messiah were Negros and at the same time exploit the <b> African </b>Continent. \nI have no general hatred of European of Jew-ish people. I am a people person and really do love white people and Jews. It is those perpetrators who willfully deceive that should be exposed.

Is there democracy??try to question your forefathers your roots your religion your sharia beliefs your teachings one or two can be wrong not the whole country like majority islamic lands are always in dispute fighting themselves or others barbaric sense less sick mindset @ uneducated ,<b>  dumb</b> dna, poverty ,shabby,?? You want to grow population like ants infiltrating your beliefs into the english and Asian Christian and Hindu lands??Look at China ,Canada,Britain and India they are struggling with this minority religion just because they were given equal opportunity and freedom of speech and now resisting to live at peace..They will change the peaceful lands into dirty neighborhoods and wrzone..No wonder sad to say but you believe in converting ppl to your religion never hold english manners or respect for others religions and  have an attacking betrayal behavior..Again no offense or hatred towards any individual in particular but this is the real image of this world. FACTS to understand why don't you name the troubled countries and who's the majority communities?? And why is their so much unrest?? What laws?? Where is the progress ??? Why and whom are you questioning?? I do not believe in being <b> a racis</b>t or show hatred towards any community or religion ..But the facts around the world stated as an opinion and right to freedom of speech..",

The sons of JAPHETH Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan. And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.\"\n\n\nTherefore, the majority of the \"jews\" that inhabit the land of Israel today are by conviction of their name and Biblical lineage, not of Shem/semetic. They are indeed of Japheth (decendants of converts to Judaism and not of the bloodline/lineage of the Biblical Hebrew Israelites).",

Instead he is a decendant of the Kazarian Kingdom who under King  Bulan converted to Judaism in 740 AD. You are not a Hebrews and your lies will reserve you a place in hell. Revelation 2:9 and 3:9 states very clearly these people are imposters. \nJacob the father of the 12 Hebrew tribes was married to an Egyptian <b> Negro.</b> Moses was married to a Ethiopian<b>  woman</b>. The Biblical Hebrews wer<b> e Blac</b>k Negros. Oh, they will say the Messiah had olive skin but I only know of two colors for olives; green a<b> nd bla</b>ck olives is all I know and I am sure the people of the holy land w<b> ere bl</b>ack people. This includes Egyptians and Ethiopian people. \nNow this cracke will call me anti-Semitic because average people don't know Semitic is a class of languages indigenous to Africa. Semetic languages includes Arabic, Aramaic, Hebrew, Tegri, Amharic and many other derivatives all of which are spoke<b> n by Afr</b>ican people. \nThese Zionist have put Jared Kushner in a position to push the Israeli agenda.\nLevin and Hannity are Jewish agents in this country. \nThey say Israel is our allies but that didn't stop them from killing Americans when they attacked the USS Liberty kiiling many Americans with the intention of blaming it on Egyptians. So America would join them in fight against the arabs.\nNo one seems to remember Israel spying on American and then passing that info onto the Russian government in exchange for more Jews being allowed to immigrate to Israel.\nLet's not forget how they were caught trying to get strategic info on our troop placements so they could pass the info on to insurgents with the intention of giving the Iraqi insurgents a better strategic advantage to kill American troops so there wouldn't be a chance we would consider more troops in the region\nTrump will go to jail when all this is finished. Netenyahu or I should say Millenkosky which is his real name before his father changed his name to sound more Hebrew and not Polish.\nThese Jewish imposters were a perfect substitute to distract from the true identity o<b> f the Af</b>rican Hebrews.\nOn a personal note I pray for the destruction on Levin and Hannity. Their destruction will be an example to the rest of these satanic traitors.",

Nancy Pelosi only made her apologize because she needs cash flow from Hollywood and pro-israel groups which have long supported the Socialist Democratic Party. They really should change their name and drop democratic because they no longer are Representatives of democracy but of hate, anti-semitism, and anti-American. Barbra Streisand and Steven Spielberg stay silent while this anti-semite boast her hate of Jews. Chuck Schumer, a Jew, has enjoyed unleashing these little Somalian Muslim hate mongers along with the Press who have paraded them in front of the cameras every night to punish Americans, to insult Americans, because America voted for Trump. Remember one thing Chucky that little Somalian Muslim Omar would cut your personal parts off in a moment because she considers you a low life Jew.",

They have a genuine distaste for whites and Christianity EVEN though this<b>  nation</b> AFFORDED THEM so much and has so MORE THAN ANY OTHE<b> R NATIO</b>N. No one had done more for the benefit of jews then white men. Now those same jews wish to claim otherwise and say \"we did it all ourselves with white men trying to keep us down all the way, so let's beat them up.\" And they are. Jews run the left Democratic party. Kissinger is and was Bill and Hillary's mentor. Didn't you ever notice that with every \"minority\" group created, jews attach themselves to it. They always REMIND everyone through the news when covering \"minority\" stories that \"remember us, remember the holocaust?\" Even jewish writers changed the real story <b> of Bla</b>ck Klansman to make the white partner a jewish man. They just have to surround themselves with \"minority\" groups that they play a HUGE part in creating so that they can get votes and protection. They have convinced many blacks that \"You are being forced down. America is wh<b> ite rac</b>ist run and they have it in for you.\" Jews reinforce the \"persecution complex\" in blacks for their own jewish gain. Jews and Judaism declared war on white Christianity a long time ago and have been working towards its end ever since HENCE mass 3rd world immigration, white guilting and shaming constantly in the press and in movies. They NEED \"minorities\" votes because they do not have the numbers themselves to accomplish what they want which is Jews on top, gentiles on the bottom, laws in effect to protect jews, like ANY and ALL jewish talk of jews conspiring, as \"anti-Semitic\" hate speech. As for blacks voting dem, it is mostly blacks who have been duped by jewish media lies that reinforce t<b> heir b</b>lack \"persecution complex.\" The jews are the dividers and accusers, and it is for their own gain that they do so. Whether they understand  they are destroying something great is another thing. It is like they are so passionate about being jewish and the world is theirs to rule that they completely missed maybe they were just envious and should have assimilated better. Their Talmud, which rabbis have to know and teach, preaches against gentiles, Jesus, Christians, non jews which is why the jews don't knock on gentile doors asking you to come learn with them from their holy books. Judaism IS anti-Christian at its core and it is the biggest secret kept in America and especially away from Christians. Jews also run the conservative right as jews don't care which side wins in election as long as Israel wins and jews win.  They play both sides but always for jewish causes.",

First of all Semitic is not a group of people it is a family of languages indigenous to Africa. Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, Tegri, and about 400 others spoken Africa.\r\nThe Zionists rule our country and have infiltrated the Christian Church. Any bible scholar knows the Jews are descendants from the European Kazarian Kingdom. In 740 AD they converted to Judaism under King Bulan. For hundreds of years they ruled a region between the Caspian and <b> Black </b>Sea. They converted to Judaism the same way Donald Trump's daughter did. These imposters have no genetic, historical, or archeological connections to the Biblical Hebrews. \r\nThe Christian church remains silent because if these European imposters are exposed; then people will ask who and where are the Hebrew Israelites.\r\nFirst of all they would look like Rep. Omar. The biblical Hebrews were Negros. Israel is in Africa despite attempts to redefine it as the middle east. \r\nMoses was raised as Pharaohs Grandson and all the Pharaoh's of that era were Negros. Pharaoh had order the murder of all Hebrew baby boys of Moses<b>  age</b>. Their was no physical differences between Hebrews, Egyptian, and Ethiopian people. When Moses true identity was discovered he fled into the wilderness. While resting at the well he helped the Shepard girls water their flock. When they return home early their father ask them, \" how is it you are back home so soon\". They answered an Egyptian helped us. They thought he was Egyptian because Moses fled with the clothes on his back. He was still wearing Egyptian clothes. Moses married an Ethiopia<b> n woma</b>n. King Salomon and Sheba first born son Maliki became the first King of Ethiopia. \r\nEuropean were desperate to white wash history. For this lie to work they had to make the Egyptians and the Israelites white. This served the Kazarian European Jews and the Christian church. In many European countries that were not invested in the exploitation of Africa and it's people; you fi<b> nd Bla</b>ck Madonna and Messiah.\r\nThe Catholic Church decided to change the image of the Messiah. Pope Alexander VI commission a new European image of the Messiah. It was a big deal so a heated competition between DaVinci and Michelangelo ended with DaVinci winning the contract because he was rumored to be the lover of the Pope's son Cesare Borgia. The image of the Christ that is on a billion pictures is <b> the<b>  </b</b>>gay son of Pope Alexander. \r\nWhy would the Hebrew people ever go to Europe. When threatened they always fled to Egypt and when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans they fled in to south and west Africa where you can find the tribes today. These Africans pass the Genetic test and they still follow Hebrew traditions. \r\nThe very first maps of Africa commissioned by European Kings shows a section of West Africa called the Kingdom of Judah. Now this is where the story gets interesting. When the slave trade started we are told <b> other Af</b>rican sold<b>  other A</b>frican tribes into slavery. The truth that will shatter all we know today is the first slaves brought to the Western Hemisphere were the tribe of Judah. Yes, the hated blacks of the America's are directly decendant of the tribe of Judah.\r\nThe imposter Netenyahu stood before Congress claming Moses led his people, but Moses never went to Poland. Netenyahu whose real name was Millenkosky before his father changed it to sound Hebrew.\r\nSome say they are our allies. I need only point out how they have spied on us for decades and then sold those secrets to our strategic enemies. Russia received the bulk of these secrets in exchange for allowing more Jews to immigrate to Israel.\r\nDuring the Iraq war they were caught trying to steal secrets about our troop placements in Iraq. Intending to assist insurgents kill American troops. Even more dramatic was the 1967 attack on the USS LIBERTY. They made every attempt to sink this ship and blame it on the Egyptians during the Arab Israeli war. The ship was clearly American and many sailors lost their lives as the Israeli Airforce and Navy mercilessly killed many American sailors.\r\nIf you are an American patriot you can not stand by and let this foreign power use us for their evil goals.\r\nJerrod Kushner is a traitor and he is setting us up for conflict with every country around Israel. Iraq, Libya, Iran, Syria must be destroyed and they used ISIS and American to do it. ISIS has attacked Christians and MUSLIMS; but never Israel and no one seems to think something is strange abo<b> ut this te</b>rrorist organization never throwing even one pebble at Israel but swear war on everyone else.\r\nIf you are a Christian please realize they use your love of Jesus to manipulate American politics.\r\nAlso realize Jesus was not the Messiah name and the bible clearly predicted this great identity theft. Revelations 2:9 and 3:9 clearly calls these people as the synagogue of Satan.",

Do you truly believe Isis is coming out of Israel? Is it there annihilation that those that condemn them want or perhaps removed from there land where they are surrounded by those bent on their deaths, imprisonment? I served in the military we never had any orders or notions that Israel was bent on our destruction but I don't forget what happened in the past either, the full details were never released and or redacted however there is of course a ton of conjecture. You seem to have all the evidence in your own statements that the Jews are evil manipulating lying imposters and if you wanna hate on them my man have at it. I'm just not gonna join and cannot be swayed from my beliefs and what's up with hated blacks in America statement I don't know or have met anyone who hates people for there color this the  brainwashing propaganda that the Democrat mainstream media uses to keep getting the vote.",

Another is fomenting the ever present and growing antisemitic sentiment with slogans like \"Israel has hypnotized the world\" and generally refer to the \"evil things\" of Israel. Telling the truth is beyond one's personal feelings or belief. Put those sentences in Hitler's mouth.",

                    "commentText": "How can you call her anti-Semitic? She is likely more Semitic than Netenyahu. The bible says the devil will deceive the world. First of all Semitic is not a group of people it is a family of languages indigenous to Africa. Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, Tegri, and about 400 others spoken Africa.\r\nThe Zionists rule our country and have infiltrated the Christian Church. Any bible scholar knows the Jews are descendants from the European Kazarian Kingdom. In 740 AD they converted to Judaism under King Bulan. For hundreds of years they ruled a region between the Caspian and <b> Black </b>Sea. They converted to Judaism the same way Donald Trump's daughter did. These imposters have no genetic, historical, or archeological connections to the Biblical Hebrews. \r\nThe Christian church remains silent because if these European imposters are exposed; then people will ask who and where are the Hebrew Israelites.\r\nFirst of all they would look like Rep. Omar. The biblical Hebrews were Negros. Israel is in Africa despite attempts to redefine it as the middle east. \r\nMoses was raised as Pharaohs Grandson and all the Pharaoh's of that era were Negros. Pharaoh had order the murder of all Hebrew baby boys of Moses<b>  age</b>. Their was no physical differences between Hebrews, Egyptian, and Ethiopian people. When Moses true identity was discovered he fled into the wilderness. While resting at the well he helped the Shepard girls water their flock. When they return home early their father ask them, \" how is it you are back home so soon\". They answered an Egyptian helped us. They thought he was Egyptian because Moses fled with the clothes on his back. He was still wearing Egyptian clothes. Moses married an Ethiopia<b> n woma</b>n. King Salomon and Sheba first born son Maliki became the first King of Ethiopia. \r\nEuropean were desperate to white wash history. For this lie to work they had to make the Egyptians and the Israelites white. This served the Kazarian European Jews and the Christian church. In many European countries that were not invested in the exploitation of Africa and it's people; you fi<b> nd Bla</b>ck Madonna and Messiah.\r\nThe Catholic Church decided to change the image of the Messiah. Pope Alexander VI commission a new European image of the Messiah. It was a big deal so a heated competition between DaVinci and Michelangelo ended with DaVinci winning the contract because he was rumored to be the lover of the Pope's son Cesare Borgia. The image of the Christ that is on a billion pictures is <b> the<b>  </b</b>>gay son of Pope Alexander. \r\nWhy would the Hebrew people ever go to Europe. When threatened they always fled to Egypt and when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans they fled in to south and west Africa where you can find the tribes today. These Africans pass the Genetic test and they still follow Hebrew traditions. \r\nThe very first maps of Africa commissioned by European Kings shows a section of West Africa called the Kingdom of Judah. Now this is where the story gets interesting. When the slave trade started we are told <b> other Af</b>rican sold<b>  other A</b>frican tribes into slavery. The truth that will shatter all we know today is the first slaves brought to the Western Hemisphere were the tribe of Judah. Yes, the hated blacks of the America's are directly decendant of the tribe of Judah.\r\nThe imposter Netenyahu stood before Congress claming Moses led his people, but Moses never went to Poland. Netenyahu whose real name was Millenkosky before his father changed it to sound Hebrew.\r\nSome say they are our allies. I need only point out how they have spied on us for decades and then sold those secrets to our strategic enemies. Russia received the bulk of these secrets in exchange for allowing more Jews to immigrate to Israel.\r\nDuring the Iraq war they were caught trying to steal secrets about our troop placements in Iraq. Intending to assist insurgents kill American troops. Even more dramatic was the 1967 attack on the USS LIBERTY. They made every attempt to sink this ship and blame it on the Egyptians during the Arab Israeli war. The ship was clearly American and many sailors lost their lives as the Israeli Airforce and Navy mercilessly killed many American sailors.\r\nIf you are an American patriot you can not stand by and let this foreign power use us for their evil goals.\r\nJerrod Kushner is a traitor and he is setting us up for conflict with every country around Israel. Iraq, Libya, Iran, Syria must be destroyed and they used ISIS and American to do it. ISIS has attacked Christians and MUSLIMS; but never Israel and no one seems to think something is strange abo<b> ut this te</b>rrorist organization never throwing even one pebble at Israel but swear war on everyone else.\r\nIf you are a Christian please realize they use your love of Jesus to manipulate American politics.\r\nAlso realize Jesus was not the Messiah name and the bible clearly predicted this great identity theft. Revelations 2:9 and 3:9 clearly calls these people as the synagogue of Satan.",

I bet a 5-year <b> old </b>boy in kindergarten can write a better English than this piece of shit. Take it back to your disoppointing English teacher to correct it and re-edit for you  if you had one ever. I wonder, if the Rep. Omar doesn't know English language and no one can understand , how then, even an  idiot like you could  negatively react to her statements or speeches. Or what  made you such a dungy. For example if I say to you: \"waxaad tihiin xaarwalwaaleyaal xaar faraha kula jira.,\" you couldn't understand what I am talking about right! And there won't be any of these trash talks. \nNow, I tell you that our forefathers, founders of this country wanted and decided that the United States of America to be a representative democracy. Where American citizens choose some of their compatriots to make laws and represent their interests and public affairs in government. They wanted a country ruled by laws , not by anti-immigrants and bigots like you. They urged Americans to ,  strictly , uphold and abide \" the rule of law\" in order this<b>  nation</b> to have a lasting freedom , stable constitution , domestic tranqiility and stable government.",

First of all Semitic is not a group of people it is a family of languages indigenous to Africa. Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, Tegri, and about 400 others spoken Africa.\r\nThe Zionists rule our country and have infiltrated the Christian Church. Any bible scholar knows the Jews are descendants from the European Kazarian Kingdom. In 740 AD they converted to Judaism under King Bulan. For hundreds of years they ruled a region between the Caspian and <b> Black </b>Sea. They converted to Judaism the same way Donald Trump's daughter did. These imposters have no genetic, historical, or archeological connections to the Biblical Hebrews. \r\nThe Christian church remains silent because if these European imposters are exposed; then people will ask who and where are the Hebrew Israelites.\r\nFirst of all they would look like Rep. Omar. The biblical Hebrews were Negros. Israel is in Africa despite attempts to redefine it as the middle east. \r\nMoses was raised as Pharaohs Grandson and all the Pharaoh's of that era were Negros. Pharaoh had order the murder of all Hebrew baby boys of Moses<b>  age</b>. Their was no physical differences between Hebrews, Egyptian, and Ethiopian people. When Moses true identity was discovered he fled into the wilderness. While resting at the well he helped the Shepard girls water their flock. When they return home early their father ask them, \" how is it you are back home so soon\". They answered an Egyptian helped us. They thought he was Egyptian because Moses fled with the clothes on his back. He was still wearing Egyptian clothes. Moses married an Ethiopia<b> n woma</b>n. King Salomon and Sheba first born son Maliki became the first King of Ethiopia. \r\nEuropean were desperate to white wash history. For this lie to work they had to make the Egyptians and the Israelites white. This served the Kazarian European Jews and the Christian church. In many European countries that were not invested in the exploitation of Africa and it's people; you fi<b> nd Bla</b>ck Madonna and Messiah.\r\nThe Catholic Church decided to change the image of the Messiah. Pope Alexander VI commission a new European image of the Messiah. It was a big deal so a heated competition between DaVinci and Michelangelo ended with DaVinci winning the contract because he was rumored to be the lover of the Pope's son Cesare Borgia. The image of the Christ that is on a billion pictures is <b> the<b>  </b</b>>gay son of Pope Alexander. \r\nWhy would the Hebrew people ever go to Europe. When threatened they always fled to Egypt and when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans they fled in to south and west Africa where you can find the tribes today. These Africans pass the Genetic test and they still follow Hebrew traditions. \r\nThe very first maps of Africa commissioned by European Kings shows a section of West Africa called the Kingdom of Judah. Now this is where the story gets interesting. When the slave trade started we are told <b> other Af</b>rican sold<b>  other A</b>frican tribes into slavery. The truth that will shatter all we know today is the first slaves brought to the Western Hemisphere were the tribe of Judah. Yes, the hated blacks of the America's are directly decendant of the tribe of Judah.\r\nThe imposter Netenyahu stood before Congress claming Moses led his people, but Moses never went to Poland. Netenyahu whose real name was Millenkosky before his father changed it to sound Hebrew.\r\nSome say they are our allies. I need only point out how they have spied on us for decades and then sold those secrets to our strategic enemies. Russia received the bulk of these secrets in exchange for allowing more Jews to immigrate to Israel.\r\nDuring the Iraq war they were caught trying to steal secrets about our troop placements in Iraq. Intending to assist insurgents kill American troops. Even more dramatic was the 1967 attack on the USS LIBERTY. They made every attempt to sink this ship and blame it on the Egyptians during the Arab Israeli war. The ship was clearly American and many sailors lost their lives as the Israeli Airforce and Navy mercilessly killed many American sailors.\r\nIf you are an American patriot you can not stand by and let this foreign power use us for their evil goals.\r\nJerrod Kushner is a traitor and he is setting us up for conflict with every country around Israel. Iraq, Libya, Iran, Syria must be destroyed and they used ISIS and American to do it. ISIS has attacked Christians and MUSLIMS; but never Israel and no one seems to think something is strange abo<b> ut this te</b>rrorist organization never throwing even one pebble at Israel but swear war on everyone else.\r\nIf you are a Christian please realize they use your love of Jesus to manipulate American politics.\r\nAlso realize Jesus was not the Messiah name and the bible clearly predicted this great identity theft. Revelations 2:9 and 3:9 clearly calls these people as the synagogue of Satan.",

When this is the case, this is what such a country will have: \r\n(1) A repressive regime where dissent and freedom of speech are not allowed in any form. Dissidents are put in prison or killed.\r\n(2) The lower class is abused. (Press \"Read more\".) \r\n(3) The poor have virtually no chance of getting ahead.\r\n(4) A poor educational system (if there be one at all) with rigid indoctrination. \n(5) Fixed elections where \"elected officials\" in order to be elected must stay true to the views of who''s in charge. \r\n(6) A third rate medical system (if at all).\r\n(7) Women are treated as minors or 2nd class citizens. \r\n(8) A country with an average IQ score of 85. \r\n(9) The general population just gets by or barely subsists. For instance, buying a used car is out of the question for most. \r\n(10) The vast majority of the people of such countries want to immigrate to countries where Jews (as well as everyone else) have full rights as a citizen. In other words, they want to escape an outdated caste system. \r\n(11) This statement \"Jews have been kicked out of countries 359 times in history\". Whenever some anti semite becomes the head of a country and does that, the country itself falls apart eventually and no longer has the standard of living that was once there. The country falls into economic decline or complete chaos about 5 to 15 years later after it's done.",

First of all Semitic is not a group of people it is a family of languages indigenous to Africa. Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, Tegri, and about 400 others spoken Africa.\r\nThe Zionists rule our country and have infiltrated the Christian Church. Any bible scholar knows the Jews are descendants from the European Kazarian Kingdom. In 740 AD they converted to Judaism under King Bulan. For hundreds of years they ruled a region between the Caspian and <b> Black </b>Sea. They converted to Judaism the same way Donald Trump's daughter did. These imposters have no genetic, historical, or archeological connections to the Biblical Hebrews. \r\nThe Christian church remains silent because if these European imposters are exposed; then people will ask who and where are the Hebrew Israelites.\r\nFirst of all they would look like Rep. Omar. The biblical Hebrews were Negros. Israel is in Africa despite attempts to redefine it as the middle east. \r\nMoses was raised as Pharaohs Grandson and all the Pharaoh's of that era were Negros. Pharaoh had order the murder of all Hebrew baby boys of Moses<b>  age</b>. Their was no physical differences between Hebrews, Egyptian, and Ethiopian people. When Moses true identity was discovered he fled into the wilderness. While resting at the well he helped the Shepard girls water their flock. When they return home early their father ask them, \" how is it you are back home so soon\". They answered an Egyptian helped us. They thought he was Egyptian because Moses fled with the clothes on his back. He was still wearing Egyptian clothes. Moses married an Ethiopia<b> n woma</b>n. King Salomon and Sheba first born son Maliki became the first King of Ethiopia. \r\nEuropean were desperate to white wash history. For this lie to work they had to make the Egyptians and the Israelites white. This served the Kazarian European Jews and the Christian church. In many European countries that were not invested in the exploitation of Africa and it's people; you fi<b> nd Bla</b>ck Madonna and Messiah.\r\nThe Catholic Church decided to change the image of the Messiah. Pope Alexander VI commission a new European image of the Messiah. It was a big deal so a heated competition between DaVinci and Michelangelo ended with DaVinci winning the contract because he was rumored to be the lover of the Pope's son Cesare Borgia. The image of the Christ that is on a billion pictures is <b> the<b>  </b</b>>gay son of Pope Alexander. \r\nWhy would the Hebrew people ever go to Europe. When threatened they always fled to Egypt and when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans they fled in to south and west Africa where you can find the tribes today. These Africans pass the Genetic test and they still follow Hebrew traditions. \r\nThe very first maps of Africa commissioned by European Kings shows a section of West Africa called the Kingdom of Judah. Now this is where the story gets interesting. When the slave trade started we are told <b> other Af</b>rican sold<b>  other A</b>frican tribes into slavery. The truth that will shatter all we know today is the first slaves brought to the Western Hemisphere were the tribe of Judah. Yes, the hated blacks of the America's are directly decendant of the tribe of Judah.\r\nThe imposter Netenyahu stood before Congress claming Moses led his people, but Moses never went to Poland. Netenyahu whose real name was Millenkosky before his father changed it to sound Hebrew.\r\nSome say they are our allies. I need only point out how they have spied on us for decades and then sold those secrets to our strategic enemies. Russia received the bulk of these secrets in exchange for allowing more Jews to immigrate to Israel.\r\nDuring the Iraq war they were caught trying to steal secrets about our troop placements in Iraq. Intending to assist insurgents kill American troops. Even more dramatic was the 1967 attack on the USS LIBERTY. They made every attempt to sink this ship and blame it on the Egyptians during the Arab Israeli war. The ship was clearly American and many sailors lost their lives as the Israeli Airforce and Navy mercilessly killed many American sailors.\r\nIf you are an American patriot you can not stand by and let this foreign power use us for their evil goals.\r\nJerrod Kushner is a traitor and he is setting us up for conflict with every country around Israel. Iraq, Libya, Iran, Syria must be destroyed and they used ISIS and American to do it. ISIS has attacked Christians and MUSLIMS; but never Israel and no one seems to think something is strange abo<b> ut this te</b>rrorist organization never throwing even one pebble at Israel but swear war on everyone else.\r\nIf you are a Christian please realize they use your love of Jesus to manipulate American politics.\r\nAlso realize Jesus was not the Messiah name and the bible clearly predicted this great identity theft. Revelations 2:9 and 3:9 clearly calls these people as the synagogue of Satan.",

                    "commentText": "You are a idiot\nHow can you call her anti-Semitic? She is likely more Semitic than Netenyahu. The bible says the devil will deceive the world. First of all Semitic is not a group of people it is a family of languages indigenous to Africa. Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, Tegri, and about 400 others spoken Africa.\r\nThe Zionists rule our country and have infiltrated the Christian Church. Any bible scholar knows the Jews are descendants from the European Kazarian Kingdom. In 740 AD they converted to Judaism under King Bulan. For hundreds of years they ruled a region between the Caspian and <b> Black </b>Sea. They converted to Judaism the same way Donald Trump's daughter did. These imposters have no genetic, historical, or archeological connections to the Biblical Hebrews. \r\nThe Christian church remains silent because if these European imposters are exposed; then people will ask who and where are the Hebrew Israelites.\r\nFirst of all they would look like Rep. Omar. The biblical Hebrews were Negros. Israel is in Africa despite attempts to redefine it as the middle east. \r\nMoses was raised as Pharaohs Grandson and all the Pharaoh's of that era were Negros. Pharaoh had order the murder of all Hebrew baby boys of Moses<b>  age</b>. Their was no physical differences between Hebrews, Egyptian, and Ethiopian people. When Moses true identity was discovered he fled into the wilderness. While resting at the well he helped the Shepard girls water their flock. When they return home early their father ask them, \" how is it you are back home so soon\". They answered an Egyptian helped us. They thought he was Egyptian because Moses fled with the clothes on his back. He was still wearing Egyptian clothes. Moses married an Ethiopia<b> n woma</b>n. King Salomon and Sheba first born son Maliki became the first King of Ethiopia. \r\nEuropean were desperate to white wash history. For this lie to work they had to make the Egyptians and the Israelites white. This served the Kazarian European Jews and the Christian church. In many European countries that were not invested in the exploitation of Africa and it's people; you fi<b> nd Bla</b>ck Madonna and Messiah.\r\nThe Catholic Church decided to change the image of the Messiah. Pope Alexander VI commission a new European image of the Messiah. It was a big deal so a heated competition between DaVinci and Michelangelo ended with DaVinci winning the contract because he was rumored to be the lover of the Pope's son Cesare Borgia. The image of the Christ that is on a billion pictures is <b> the<b>  </b</b>>gay son of Pope Alexander. \r\nWhy would the Hebrew people ever go to Europe. When threatened they always fled to Egypt and when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans they fled in to south and west Africa where you can find the tribes today. These Africans pass the Genetic test and they still follow Hebrew traditions. \r\nThe very first maps of Africa commissioned by European Kings shows a section of West Africa called the Kingdom of Judah. Now this is where the story gets interesting. When the slave trade started we are told <b> other Af</b>rican sold<b>  other A</b>frican tribes into slavery. The truth that will shatter all we know today is the first slaves brought to the Western Hemisphere were the tribe of Judah. Yes, the hated blacks of the America's are directly decendant of the tribe of Judah.\r\nThe imposter Netenyahu stood before Congress claming Moses led his people, but Moses never went to Poland. Netenyahu whose real name was Millenkosky before his father changed it to sound Hebrew.\r\nSome say they are our allies. I need only point out how they have spied on us for decades and then sold those secrets to our strategic enemies. Russia received the bulk of these secrets in exchange for allowing more Jews to immigrate to Israel.\r\nDuring the Iraq war they were caught trying to steal secrets about our troop placements in Iraq. Intending to assist insurgents kill American troops. Even more dramatic was the 1967 attack on the USS LIBERTY. They made every attempt to sink this ship and blame it on the Egyptians during the Arab Israeli war. The ship was clearly American and many sailors lost their lives as the Israeli Airforce and Navy mercilessly killed many American sailors.\r\nIf you are an American patriot you can not stand by and let this foreign power use us for their evil goals.\r\nJerrod Kushner is a traitor and he is setting us up for conflict with every country around Israel. Iraq, Libya, Iran, Syria must be destroyed and they used ISIS and American to do it. ISIS has attacked Christians and MUSLIMS; but never Israel and no one seems to think something is strange abo<b> ut this te</b>rrorist organization never throwing even one pebble at Israel but swear war on everyone else.\r\nIf you are a Christian please realize they use your love of Jesus to manipulate American politics.\r\nAlso realize Jesus was not the Messiah name and the bible clearly predicted this great identity theft. Revelations 2:9 and 3:9 clearly calls these people as the synagogue of Satan.",

Furthermore, Christopher confirms <b> the Qu</b>ran contained myths borrowed from the Christian and Jewish religion by 7th-century warlords to form\r\nthe Islamic religion which in turn was used to control their soldiers and people they conquered.

At the end of the day god is god. If anyone has a bad or evil intention they will never get away or escape from god. Anyone who believes in god should know that. We are all here to make the world better. I believe one person can change the world. not just America Middle East or Israel or Africa. We are all human and we all have the same needs. It's sad seeing all this reviews in YouTube how bad things they are saying about muslim or Islam religion. It's because of ilhan  Omar's opinion that doesn't mean all Muslims and Arabs are the same. Let's not forget that every religion teaches respect and humanity. I'm sure the Islam religion teaches to respect the Jewish towra book and the christian bible book. I'm proud to be a Muslim <b> woman,</b> and I never hate anyone because of their religion. God bless America always in my opinion they are the only one who are making the world better today not just America but the world. I don't care what anyone thinks about my opinion I'm proud to be who I am. My dream is one the world will be peace and every human can travel anywhere they like and learn and educate their beautiful culture and religion and enjoy the beauty of earth with full of love and care no meter what<b>  race</b> and religion they are. Love is stronger then hate let's love and pray to the lord of Adam",

Hence the reason the<b>  Quran</b> is recognized foundation of the Islamic religion. Of course I do not believe that it is the direct word of God for number of reasons. One simple reason is I have yet to read a verse in th<b> e Qura</b>n that goes beyond the knowledge  of a 7th or 8th-century individual. I mean, it is clear that Islam was created by warlords to keep control of their soldiers and people they conquered. T<b> he Qur</b>an is filled with intimidation to prevent Muslims from leaving the faith and this is confirmed by a well respected Muslim scholar.  Anyone can have a good heart but if they follow a religion in which their God directly tells them to make all people submit to their Allah or they must pay a tax or ??? and the one person they respect the most says \"kill all infidels\". Big Problem!",

It's anti injustice and anti oppression that the so called leftist Democrats and other freedom loving people's across the  world are up against. Is that wrong. But its very cunningly twisted to make it look that they are all 'anti-sremitic'. It's a master plan to distract the world from Israel's, atrocities against the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians are subjected to the worst form of apartheid,  hatred, violence, killings and terrorism by the Israeli government and army. The <b> nation </b>owns a stockpile of some 400-500 nuclear weapons apart from the latest hitech weapons which they use freely against unarmed Palestinians who have<b>  nothing</b> but stones and cheap home made glorified firecrackers which are described as 'rockets', and they don't even explode. So stop lying and distracting the world from Palestine's real issue by constantly camouflaging the hidden truth of the ghastly brutal occupation and terrorism of Palestinians by the newly arrived East and West Europeans. Palestinians have been living in their homes since 13 centuries. So stop these lies and murders and of course distractions of 'anti semitism' bullshit.",

He talks about \"fair weather liberals\" regarding Roger Stone's indictment, but openly supports the Clintons, a serial rapist and both protected criminals, who sold US assets to the Russians for personal financial gain and political bribes and exposed unsecured and classified documents to the web, to name only two crimes. Remember that Dershowitz was implicated in the same Epstein <b> sex </b>scandal as the Clintons and Bill travelled multiple times, deliberately without security, on Epstein's Lolita Express. This is the kind of blackmailable filth that cements loyalties in politics. \n\nConservatives should capitalise on but be very wary of Dershowitz; Trump's pro-Israel policy may be all that endears Dershowitz to the Republicans. The left-wing may eventually realise that their ostracism of Dershowitz is counter-productive and Dershowitz will be welcomed back to the fold, all sins forgiven.",

                    "commentText": "Satan is a God too.\nHow can you call her anti-Semitic? She is likely more Semitic than Netenyahu. The bible says the devil will deceive the world. First of all Semitic is not a group of people it is a family of languages indigenous to Africa. Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, Tegri, and about 400 others spoken Africa.\r\nThe Zionists rule our country and have infiltrated the Christian Church. Any bible scholar knows the Jews are descendants from the European Kazarian Kingdom. In 740 AD they converted to Judaism under King Bulan. For hundreds of years they ruled a region between the Caspian and <b> Black </b>Sea. They converted to Judaism the same way Donald Trump's daughter did. These imposters have no genetic, historical, or archeological connections to the Biblical Hebrews. \r\nThe Christian church remains silent because if these European imposters are exposed; then people will ask who and where are the Hebrew Israelites.\r\nFirst of all they would look like Rep. Omar. The biblical Hebrews were Negros. Israel is in Africa despite attempts to redefine it as the middle east. \r\nMoses was raised as Pharaohs Grandson and all the Pharaoh's of that era were Negros. Pharaoh had order the murder of all Hebrew baby boys of Moses<b>  age</b>. Their was no physical differences between Hebrews, Egyptian, and Ethiopian people. When Moses true identity was discovered he fled into the wilderness. While resting at the well he helped the Shepard girls water their flock. When they return home early their father ask them, \" how is it you are back home so soon\". They answered an Egyptian helped us. They thought he was Egyptian because Moses fled with the clothes on his back. He was still wearing Egyptian clothes. Moses married an Ethiopia<b> n woma</b>n. King Salomon and Sheba first born son Maliki became the first King of Ethiopia. \r\nEuropean were desperate to white wash history. For this lie to work they had to make the Egyptians and the Israelites white. This served the Kazarian European Jews and the Christian church. In many European countries that were not invested in the exploitation of Africa and it's people; you fi<b> nd Bla</b>ck Madonna and Messiah.\r\nThe Catholic Church decided to change the image of the Messiah. Pope Alexander VI commission a new European image of the Messiah. It was a big deal so a heated competition between DaVinci and Michelangelo ended with DaVinci winning the contract because he was rumored to be the lover of the Pope's son Cesare Borgia. The image of the Christ that is on a billion pictures is <b> the<b>  </b</b>>gay son of Pope Alexander. \r\nWhy would the Hebrew people ever go to Europe. When threatened they always fled to Egypt and when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans they fled in to south and west Africa where you can find the tribes today. These Africans pass the Genetic test and they still follow Hebrew traditions. \r\nThe very first maps of Africa commissioned by European Kings shows a section of West Africa called the Kingdom of Judah. Now this is where the story gets interesting. When the slave trade started we are told <b> other Af</b>rican sold<b>  other A</b>frican tribes into slavery. The truth that will shatter all we know today is the first slaves brought to the Western Hemisphere were the tribe of Judah. Yes, the hated blacks of the America's are directly decendant of the tribe of Judah.\r\nThe imposter Netenyahu stood before Congress claming Moses led his people, but Moses never went to Poland. Netenyahu whose real name was Millenkosky before his father changed it to sound Hebrew.\r\nSome say they are our allies. I need only point out how they have spied on us for decades and then sold those secrets to our strategic enemies. Russia received the bulk of these secrets in exchange for allowing more Jews to immigrate to Israel.\r\nDuring the Iraq war they were caught trying to steal secrets about our troop placements in Iraq. Intending to assist insurgents kill American troops. Even more dramatic was the 1967 attack on the USS LIBERTY. They made every attempt to sink this ship and blame it on the Egyptians during the Arab Israeli war. The ship was clearly American and many sailors lost their lives as the Israeli Airforce and Navy mercilessly killed many American sailors.\r\nIf you are an American patriot you can not stand by and let this foreign power use us for their evil goals.\r\nJerrod Kushner is a traitor and he is setting us up for conflict with every country around Israel. Iraq, Libya, Iran, Syria must be destroyed and they used ISIS and American to do it. ISIS has attacked Christians and MUSLIMS; but never Israel and no one seems to think something is strange abo<b> ut this te</b>rrorist organization never throwing even one pebble at Israel but swear war on everyone else.\r\nIf you are a Christian please realize they use your love of Jesus to manipulate American politics.\r\nAlso realize Jesus was not the Messiah name and the bible clearly predicted this great identity theft. Revelations 2:9 and 3:9 clearly calls these people as the synagogue of Satan.",

The vast majority leftists aren't fans of discrimination against one's religion/ethnicity. Not to say that they're aren't some leftist that don't like Jewish people/Israel. I'm sure there are some, just like there are some conservative that don't like blacks. It's a very small number of both people but nevertheless they exist. Politicians can change their stance on issues, when given more information/insight on a topic, this is a very normal part of politics. The rise of Anti-Semitism in the US during recent years is a concerning problem, but a leftist politician changing her stance on Israel doesn't logically conclude to that Anti-Semitism is becoming normal in leftist circles (Because truly is not).",

People like Ilhans and Tlaib are setting the stage to betray this country and the constitution that they swore to uphold.. It appears that they don't give 2 shits about the words in that document; they just gave their lip service to get elected and now their true, destructive colors are coming out. Ilhans just recently went on a malicious, lie infested rant about Lindsey Graham and alluded to his 'sexuality'.

The State of Israel has gotten away with <b> Ethnic </b>cleansing, and colonization of the Indigenous Arabs population of the region. They have been violating Human Rights, and committing War Crimes for decades, and using the Holocaust as a tool to control Western Governments for decades through guilt, and claims of Antisemitism.The State of Israel is a<b>  Nation</b>, and is not the Jewish religion. Nor is it the representative for Jewish people world wide. Many Jewish peoples throughout the world oppose Zionism. Many of them from very religious Jewish communities. \nProfessor Norman Finkelstein whose parents survived th<b> e Naz</b>i concentration camps is a long time opponent of Professor Dershowitz. One of the many books he has written on the subject is called \" The Holocaust Industry\".Fox News is the real \"Fake News\", and does not report actual facts. It is a tool for propagandists playing to an audience who are too lazy to investigate facts, and truth for themselves. The people who rely on Fox News, are simply sheep being herded. People who lack the desire to learn real facts, and truths. Wake up!!!If you want to know the truth read books by Jewish Israeli born professors of history such as Illan Pappe.",

Theres only a community of people called Philistines (Palestines/Palestinians). And according to the Torah, GOD (YHWH) wanted them slaughtered. That's why GOD (YHWH), raised Jewish prophets/ judges like Samuel and Samson to kill them. The story is very well known. The Philistines/Palestinians were killed by Samson when he singlehandedly tore down the temple killing thousands of Palestinians. \n\nTODAY...muslims are trying desperately to turn the table by claiming that God has now joined the enemy and is attacking the Jews instead. REALLY? Wouldn't that make God a Traitor? Wouldn't mean God is shortsighted and picked the wrong team? Wouldn't that mean God couldn't protect His own? So, God to muslims, is a POWERLESS, and USELESS TRAITOR. That's a GOD ??? NO....that's, a CREEP pretending to be God. And they call it 'allah'?",

There are several forms:\n\nTaqiyya - Saying something that isn't true as it relates to the Muslim identity. This is a Shiite term: the Sunni counterpart is Muda'rat.\n\nKitman - Lying by omission. An example would be when Muslim apologists quote only a fragment of verse 5:32 (https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/quran/noble/sura5.html#32) (that if anyone kills \"it shall be as if he had killed all mankind\") while neglecting to mention that the rest of the verse (and the next) mandate murder in undefined cases of \"corruption\" and \"mischief.\" \n\nTawriya - Intentionally creating a false impression.\n\nMuruna - 'Blending in' by setting aside some practices of Islam or Sharia in order to advance others.",

Taking about apartheid how does Islam instruct Muslims to treat people of other faiths?",

Allah & <b> Quran </b>is bigot??? \nJust compare the following verses of Holy Bible & Holy<b>  Quran</b>...& then tell me which book is bigotry:\n\n\"There shall be NO COMPULSION in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong.\"<b>  (Qura</b>n 2:256)\n\n'And let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety<b> ' (Qur</b>an 5: 8)\n\n\"If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers.....thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: But thou shalt surely KILL HIM; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him TO DEATH, and afterwards the hand of all the people.\" (Deuteronomy 13:6-9)\n\nWell Narendra,\nThere is no comparison whatsoever between what this world has seen the 'non-Muslims' do and what the Muslims have done. The two World Wars in which 70 million people were killed were 'Christian' wars.\n\nThen there is the occupation of Muslim lands and the exploitation of their resources, which was and still is happening at the hands of 'non-Muslims' of all religions. This should be borne in mind when speaking of the Islamic view of humanity and of love and compassion. Fair-minded historians should compare the Islamic conquests of other lands with the Crusades, for example, and what happened in each case. They will see a clear difference between compassion and cruelty, love and hatred, life and death.",

A large portion of democrats are Jews,even the parties biggest donors are Jews. So why would they hate Jews? Marc Hill argued for a peaceful resolution of the Palestinian issue and called out Israel(not Jews) on their recorded human rights violations(by the UN and many human rights groups). Fox is trying to distract you into hating each other on partisan lines,yet again and keep ignoring the facts. Why is it that one cannot criticize Israel!? If someone critizes America are they anti-christian!? Open your eyes to the deception you are so willing to go for and don't get distracted by the noise. KNOW WHO IS IN CONTROL!!!",

Training <b> of docto</b>rs will take 6-8 years.\nThe contact of medical personnel with patients 'The Obama Brothers' is extremely dangerous: aggressive behavior, attacks with knives, throw out personal urine in the face<b>  of doct</b>ors, it is easy to get a deadly disease from them - for example, tuberculosis resistant to antibiotics.\nFirst of all, this 'Medica' by Obama will be received by children in schools.\nSituation:\n1 Former President of the United States Ayatollah Obama is preparing a coup, the removal of President Trump from power with the help of loyal Obama, several thousand civil servants of intelligence, justice and the media. CNN and so on ...\n2 Obama is confident that the billions of dollars previously distributed by him from the state budget will play an important role in Obama's 'victory',\n3 Obama is confident that at the right time Obama will be assiste<b> d by terro</b>rist organizations operating in the United States.\n4 Without a doubt, Obama during the 8 years of sabotage, the United States was able to steal huge amounts of money - the means to seize power.\n5 Obama uses the cl<b> assic comm</b>unist propaganda \u2014 a scheme that easily established the power of 'dictators Obama' in China, Russia, Cuba, and so on.\n6 Obama put before the President of the United States, Donald Trump, the dilemma: To be removed from power or to stop the saboteur Obama. Gripping Doc.\n7 On Obama's side, his fanaticism and outstanding leadership skills. His \"soldiers\" occupied vast territories of the West under the new Gaza and Palestine. The Middle East was given by Obama, like Sweden, to the mercy of the Obama armed Islamic State.\n8 On Obama's side, millions of people are being deceived by the socialist propaganda of the left-wing media. There is not and can not be right media in the United States.\nQuestion: US media Find and settle in the White House another pair of homosexuals in the future? That is clearly not affordable in America.\n.................................",

True Muslims take the Qur'an as their infallible guide.\n<b> Quran </b>verses 2:193 & 8:39 order Muslims to fight unbelievers until Islam is the only religion anywhere. It accordingly forbids Muslims being true friends of the unbelievers <b> (Quran</b> 3:28, 4:144) .\n\n Q 60:4 'There has arisen between us and you enmity and hatred forever unless you believe in Allah and Him alone.\" \n Q 48:29 'Muhammad is the apostle of Allah. Those who follow him are merciful to one another and ruthless to the unbelievers' \n\nThese beliefs are what Dershowitz thinks is great to have in our Congress? He should also know the extensive Jew-hatred historically and in the Qur'an:\n\u00a0 [LINK]  \n\nIt's certainly not great to have any religious zealots in Congress, esp one who believes there should be no separation of religion and state, which is what Islam teaches. Is Dershowitz going to believe a Muslim congressperson who claims she doesn't believe in these above  Qur'an commands? Then IMO he's a fool.",

They will never speak against him and what he said I wonder why? I remember the left bashing trump because he supposedly never  disavowed the right wing group and their speaker, which he actually did a few times but it's ok as long as it is beneficial to them right? Where is the outrage on why they arent speaking against farrakhan and his <b> nazi </b>loving remarks that where faaarrrrrrr worse than anything they claimed trump said or did or did not do? It's just another great example of the intolerance the left displays on a daily basis. Even if some e on the left doesent agree with somthing another liberal says they will bash their own supporters lol. The left is a sinking ship going down fast.",

            "commentText": "You know why do \" conservative outlets\" continue to have this low IQ leftist on their shows . So who are the antisemite far right groups on our side .. this man makes a general statement like that without challenge.. if he is referring to the alt-right they have never been embraced by any coservative or republican and Dinesh D'Souza interviewed Robert Spencer and their views line up with the progressive left as do the Neo-nazis are leftist socialist and have never been embraced by conservatives quit projecting Alan Dershowitz your a fool who lives in denial this man calls himself a civil libertarian and supports the party of slavery, they violated all the civil rights acts in our countries history, their father of the modern day democratic party Andrew Jackson violated all the treaties with Indians and led to trail of tears, FDR and Japanese internment camps and sent back Jews to <b> Nazi </b>Germany,<b>  racist</b> presidents like FDR, Woodrow Wilson, LBJ,  Barack Obama and their the party o<b> f jim c<b> ro</b</b>>w, the party of the southern manifesto, the party of murdering millions of babies and on and on and on...This guy is an idiot and he can not lay out the case as I just did in showing the evils of his party and equivocate it to the republican party. Our party has pretty much fought against these type of evils throughout its history and is the reason why we're still a free and gr<b> eat nat</b>ion though not perfect..The democrat party embraces Farrakhan, Al Sharpton, never called out Barack Obama who attended a antisemtic church with Jeremiah Wright for 20 years who had the Hamas charter in his church and this delusional idiot says the democrat party is not antisemetic , give me a break... we conservatives need more people like Mark Levin, Walter Williams, Thomas Sowell on t.v. who know how to argue our conservative principles not low IQ leftist like Dershowitz I never can understand why the interest in this man just because he seems like you can conversate with him... he is not rational I have heard his views and they do not go with our founding principles for if they did he would not be a democrat... So lets put true fighters for liberty on our shows we are in a battle for this country we do not need to here from delusional people who are in denial ...",

Yes Gentiles/pagans, which are mainly Islamic, shall with hostility attack and take east Jerusalem!  It's prophesied!  So don't support the antichirst ideologies that hate Jews.  Jews of Judaism are not perfect.  No one is!  But read further in verse 12.  Those that hate, attack and prosecute Israel will ROT where you stand!\n\nNotice Matthew 13:55-56.  Jesus The Christ had many blood brothers and sisters of the bloodline of His mother Mary.  And even to this day it is quite possible of that descendants of that bloodline live today even as Jews! Or Christians, or other.  Why would you hate descendants of Mary and Jesus bloodline unless Satan is your father?",

            "commentText": "The American Constitution was created by its founders to make America a Republic so that all people are guaranteed certain inalienable rights that cannot be removed in a democratic vote by a majority vote from everyone else.. What is happening now, the Democratic party has been fairly successful at removing the rights of the majority by getting Democrat voters to vote for Democratic politicians who then institute laws and policies to undermine the Republic our forefathers worked so hard to insure. The Democratic party uses taxpayer moneys to pay for votes through give aways of welfare, special interest funding, and corporate tax incentives. They also create divisions of the public through lies and half truths because it is easier to then focus on those groups to vote for democrats. The end agenda is bigger government and a dependency on government for everything. That then gives government the ability to rule with an iron fist, that is, through threats of violence, jail, and death using the police and military. If you vote for any Democrat, you are voting for your own and everyone else's enslavement or death. Democrats focus on the weakest minded people because they are so easily controlled through irrational, illogical emotions. Just look anywhere Democrats, leftist, feminists, and liberals speak; there is only emotional language spoken.  .... America must return to being a Republic.\nReligion does not teach self responsibility today. It teaches you are godly or a sinner, to be glorified or treated with disgust. There is no middle ground, yet, we are on that middle ground. We are all human with the same  internal madness of our nature. It is only self knowledge and self control which makes us different from the wolf or lion. Even the neighborhood squirrel does some things which are humanly evil and appalling.  \nI am not talking about being tolerant of what evil people do. If you are aware of the acts of violence people will do to push an agenda where all civility and compassion are cast off, think about why people will do to those outside their  group what they would not allow inside their group. This is often practiced, even in religion. There is much wisdom in the US Constitution, especially in the 'separation of church and state', of 'separation of ideology (agenda)  and the laws' we are to live by. The Republic they dreamed of has become the 'wrong think' democracy we live today. \"We hold these truths to be self evident......\". Democracy is rule by the majority. Change what people think, you change the rule of law. A republic holds that all people have certain inalienable rights which cannot be taken away by rule of law by the majority. The right to bear arms is under major attack by those who wish to dominate us.  Christianity violated those truths by pushing religious values to become law, thereby opening the door to the creation of laws of tolerance which has destroyed the value of teaching morality. It is not much different than what we see Democrats doing today. Everyone who votes for any Democrat bears the responsibility of destroying the Republic. They are the ones who created laws of 'supposed' tolerance but only if you are a Democrat. Rule by the majority is subject to the morality of that majority. .... We need to become a Republic again. Then the teaching of self-responsibility and good moral values will mean something again.",

I'm pretty sure the influx of Somali  refugees has not diminished  the number of lakes in our state, or our appreciation for and enjoyment of said lakes.. And the idea that before we  began taking in more Somali refugees than any other state, starting in the early 1990's that before that our state was some kind of Aryan ethno-state... Well over a decade before our state began taking in a high number of Somali refugees  we had been taking in Hmong and Cambodian refugees.  We already had, and continue to have, More Hmong and Cambodian refugees then any other state.... This kind of Garrison Keeler, Prarie Home Companion  picture of what Minnesota yopu allude to never existed",

Islam will not or cannot coexists with people of other religions or faiths. Look at the religious minorities in muslim majority countries - they are or have been systematically wiped out to almost nonexistence. Hindu India is facing a growing threat from its own muslims . Google for yourselves the percentage of muslims in India after the partitioning in 1947 and today. In a few more generations, muslims will form almost 50 % or more of the population of India. More than Pakistan and Bangladesh combined ! China has the foresight to see the dangers posed by Islam in  the country and has taken proactive steps to protect herself from this - I prefer to use the term - VIRUS ! The Christian West is still <b> deaf,</b><b>  dumb</b> an<b> d blin</b>d to the dangers posed by islam. Really need to wake up before it is too late to do anything about it. For example, the UK already have muslim mayors in towns and cities across the length and breadth of the country. The mayor of London is muslim and so is the Home Secretary. Soon it will be the Police Commissioner and not too long after, the PM, Chancellor and Foreign Secretary. Think I'm kidding ? Watch this space ! SHARIA LAWS will become the laws of the UK.

What I have learned from this ever-growing community in my country is that they have a special hate for the Jewish people. While any sort of (believe me, justified) criticism towards the muslim community consistently gets dismissed as being \"<b> racist\"</b>, \"dividing\", \"stigmatizing\", etc... by the left, the rampant hate from within the muslim communities towards Jewish people is not only being ignored by some leftists, it is joined by others.",

People wear a Cross to proclaim to the World that Christ was victorious over death, and therefore so shall we. PS.

Then We sent to her Our Angel, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.\n\n19:18\nShe said, \"Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, [so leave me], if you should be fearing of Allah .\"\n\n19:19 \nHe said, \"I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you [news of] a pure boy.\"\n\n19:20\nShe said, \"How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?\"\n\n19:21 \nHe said, \"Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter [already] decreed.' \"\n\n19:22 \nSo she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a remote place.\n\n19:23 \nAnd the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said, \"Oh, I wish I had died before this and was in oblivion, forgotten.\"\n\n19:24\nBut he called her from below her, \"Do not grieve; your Lord has provided beneath you a stream.\n\n19:25 \nAnd shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop upon you ripe, fresh dates.\n\n19:26\nSo eat and drink and be contented. And if you see from among humanity anyone, say, 'Indeed, I have vowed to the Most Merciful abstention, so I will not speak today to [any] man.' \"\n\n19:27\nThen she brought him to her people, carrying him. They said, \"O Mary, you have certainly done a thing unprecedented.\n\n19:28\nO sister of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.\"\n\n19:29\nSo she pointed to him. They said, \"How can we speak to one who is in the cradle a child?\"\n\n19:30\n[Jesus] said, \"Indeed, I am the servant of Allah . He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet.\n\n19:31\nAnd He has made me blessed wherever I am and has enjoined upon me prayer and zakah as long as I remain alive\n\n19:32\nAnd [made me] dutiful to my mother, and He has not made me a wretched tyrant.\n\n19:33\nAnd peace is on me the day I was born and the day I will die and the day I am raised alive.\"\n\n19:34\nThat is Jesus, the son of Mary - the word of truth about which they are in dispute.\n\n19:35\nIt is not [befitting] for Allah to take a son; exalted is He! When He decrees an affair, He only says to it, \"Be,\" and it is.\n\n19:36\n[Jesus said], \"And indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him.

Unfortunately the future for western society around the world is ultimately going to come down to what women want since they make up the majority of the populations in western society. FYI blasphemy law has already passed here in Canada and sharia is being talked about within our gov and Trudeau has openly talked about how he thinks it is compatible with democracy which is bs because to Muslims Sharia can not be altered since it is the law of god to them. We already live in a matriarchy men get crucified when it comes to divorce and can't even flirt with a women without it being considere<b> d sexua</b>l assault if she doesn't like who did it. Our birth rates in western society around the world are declining because men already have no right's and are turning away from women and terrified of marriage. Every matriarchy to ever exist has failed and only 1 exists in China today and is dying.",

How can you believe a Muslim who states she is for Jews when the writings of Islam state that Jews come from apes and they are as Christians are which the<b>  Quran</b> calls 'pigs and dogs.\" \n\nWho wants to vote for a candidate whose cult  promotes that kind of hate for the huma<b> n rac</b>e or pander to a activist Sharia Muslim like Sarsour is, and Omar was and is part and parcel to Sarsour who links herself with the Bernie Sanders' (uncle Bernie she calls him) leftist group and all these women who are part of that org. listen to Sarsour dictate to them. Sarsour even has to dictate to the 'white women' a special message because 'white people' are to be dummied down to be part of that crusade to make America bow to Sharia and Islam's dictates.\nAll of these candidates including Ocasio are there in Congress to bend the laws so that these radicals  can make way for their own cult's  agendas so they are paving the way for those hostile agendas under the guise of helping women, illegals, blacks etc.  \n\nPeople (even celebrities like Allyssa Milano) are being used to be part and parcel to this group but underneath it all the goal is to destroy the U.S. from within and make it bow to Islam's agendas and the lefti<b> st communi</b>st group aka Sanders group, and <b> the bl</b>ack activists, the illegals, and the women's groups have united with Sarsour's Power group (and remember that is CAIR in disguise) to vote for these Muslim candidates<b>  and b</b>lack activist candidates that have leaned to this power group.\n Ultimately they are using each other to get a greater voice for each need each other to be a greater voice  but buyer bewar<b> e the c</b>ommon goal is to divi<b> de the </b>Nation and let it fall to hostile agendas. \n\nDo see Laura Loomer (a Jewish journalist) approach this problem and she shows that in Minnesota the Somalian refugees are taking the monies to push for their own (Keith Ellison also) so they can use the State funds to help ONLY the Somalians. She confronts Omar, Sarsour, Milano, etc.  In one video  the American Indians are shown living in tents  and cannot get Section 8 Housing or aid because all the money goes to the elite Muslim Somalian refugees.  \nSame as in Dearborn Michigan with the no go Sharia zones.  \n\nAnd furthermore how stupid are the women activists during the Kavanaugh hearings siding with Sarsour the organizer (one of them) to rally with her for Sarsour was the one who stated that she wanted to give Brigitte Gabriel and Hirsi Ali <b> (Musli</b>m woman spokesman against genital mutilation of which she experienced)  an 'ass whippin' and 'rip out their vaginas.  So those  women activists who were non Muslim who side<b> d with</b> a woman who is anti Israel, who favors  an ideology that sponsors genital mutilation and that calls death for anyone who does not adhere to Islam, do note you are being used and lied to. \nThis is the silent Jihad being prepared for the U.S. till they become the greater number to gain power here and there are people willing to help them achieve it. So this lying techinque to the Jews was to get the vote and precede with the agenda they tote so the people believed Omar were ignorant and given over to this notion that political correctness is the way to go but it is not a two way street in Islam.\nThis is Omar's associate and sponso<b> r and </b>any woman to vote for a cult that fosters this type of ideology should be ashamed of themselves and that goes for the celebs like Milano, Amy Schumer, Cynthia Nixon and the rest.",

But Allah cautions you (to remember) himself for the final goal is to Allah. That Ibn Abbas said \"Al Taqiyya is with the tongue only; he who has been coerced into saying that which angers Allah and his heart is comfortable( I.e.  his true faith has not been shaken.) then (saying that which he has been coerced to say) will not harm him (at all); (because) al taqiyya is with the tongue only (not the heart.)\" (Book \"al Durr al Manthoor Fi al Tafsir al Ma'athoor\")\n\nAbu Bakr al Razi states \" It is permissible to speak words of unbelief when Al taqiyya is mandatory.\" _Ahkam a<b> l Qura</b>n\" v2, p 10)\n\nIbn Abbas stated \"al Takia is the uttering of the tongue, while the heart is comfortable with faith which means that the tongue is permitted to other any untruth in a time of need as long as the heart is not affected and one is still a believer.\" \n\n When the followers of Muhammad are in a weak position they are allowed to lie and do whatever is expedient to survive even if it meant breaking every Prohibition in t<b> he Qur</b>an. \n\nTaqiyya allows mohammedans to become short or long-term sleepers to be able to use deception, misinformation, disinformation, to bring discord and anything else to collapse the kuffar until Islam is dominant and the kufr is subjugated. So little Sunni you are a liar!!!!!! And you just proved it. You know what is so funny is that the person that you're talking to could be an ex-muslim, could be a minority who's actually had to live under the oppression of Muslims, or could be somebody who has just spent the time to educate herself and not take it for the words of the media, SJW marxist propaganda and Muslim propaganda.",

Typical, same mantra from Mohammedans. Name calling,  attacking others intelligence, next you will tell me that I need to be fluent in Arabic and then I need to come to an Islamic scholar to fully understand the clear super duper clear clear absolutely clear it couldn't be made any more further than clear word of Allah to fully understand Islam. The only thing that Islam gives is cognitive dissonance. \n\nI noticed you have not answered any question of mine about the fact that why is there a<b>  woman</b> in prison for drinking in the Muslim only water bucket? Is it because she's unclean cuz she happens to be a Christian? Why don't you want to answer that? is it because the real truth of Islam will come out that Muslims think that they're Supreme and that everybody else is unclean like the prophet said? Will that let out your dirty little secret that you're not quite so tolerant as you're trying to propagate?",

There is even evidence that the opioid crisis we face is a jihad against the west through Pakistani gangs. Look at what is happening around the world. This is a VERY real threat. My advice is to read some Islamic literature. EVERYTHING in Islam comes back to 2 things. The Koran and Muhammed. Always. Never let them tell you different. They view non-believers as sub-human. They believe they are doing us a favor by killing us. No joke. Educate yourselves. Be ready. The UK has fallen. Dont let America suffer their fate.",

The United States has been a shill for Israel for decades, and the fact that you so-called \"patriots\" can't see that is a testament to your stupidity. We've given Israel billions in military aid over the years, not to mention the $38 billion guaranteed over ten years by Obama; what exactly has Israel done for the US? Can we at least get a dividend here and there? The Ashkenazi \"Jews\" are not a Semitic people, they're just Europeans like all other white people. The truth will be hard to ignore in the very near future. \n\nRevelation 2:9 - \"I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.\"",

Jews, Christians, and Muslims were living peacefully in Palestine prior to the zionist state of Israel. That is why there are even Jews who not only support Palestine and Palestinians right to live peacefully in there country without occupation but condemn zionism and Israel. Are they anti-Semitic? I don't think so. Which brings me back to my original point; this is not an issue of religion although many mistaken it to be. It is an issue of morality. Is it moral to displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes to make room for Israel?",

ALL newly elected members of Congress MUST sign a contract prohibiting them from criticizing Israel...  Does anyone else feel like there's a problem here?  Wake up folks, the enemy is within, the Trojan horse is upon us.\n\n<b> 'A nati</b>on can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul o<b> f a nat</b>ion, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.' - Cicero",

They think that the Democrat party will always be under their sway but the very policies that they support and the demographic changes they happily supported and helped implement will unfortunately come back to bite them. The rising antisemitism in Europe is due to the large influx of Muslims into Europe. Many secular jews think they will be safer and happier in an America which is less white and less Christian. Unfortunately what they will find will be the exact opposite and the trend will start to show up in the Democrat party as the number of Muslims exceeds the number of Jews. Add in a few super wealthy Muslims willing to donate to the democrat party and the Democrat party whose only allegiance is to the American dollar and votes will fully embrace anti-semitism. Also encouraging the current liberal talking point that white people especially men are bad and inculcating that belief in the youth will lead to a deep hostility towards the white and jewish leadership in the Democrat party.",

SURA 3:28:\r  Let not the believers take the unbelievers for protectors rather than believers; and whoever does this, he shall have<b>  nothing</b> of (the guardianship of) Allah, but you should guard yourselves against them, guarding carefully ( \u062a\u0642\u06cc\u0629\u200e taqiyyah/taq\u012byah).     \n\nTalk to any Imam and they will freely tell you this...  if they do not lie.  I talked to one in the Capital City of Indonesia and he was extremely open and friendly with me.  He ha<b> d nothin</b>g to hide.  He told me this:  Muslims are permitted to lie: (1) to save their lives, (2) to reconcile a husband and wife, (3) to persuade<b>  a wom</b>an into a bedroom and (4) to facilitate one on his journey. Muslims are even permitted to disavow Islam and Mohammed if it is not a genuine heart-felt rejection. Muslims will tell you that concealment of a truth is not an abandonment of that truth if it benefits Islam.  So, basically you can lie if you can justify that it serves Mohammad, and the ultimate goal of Islam, in making the entire world subservient to their religion, or they will kill you.  Yes, it is radical...and Yes, they firmly believe in it with their entire being.... and Yes, Americans, Europe, and the West cannot fit that into their Ideological motif of \"Lets just be all inclusive and get along\" mentality.  They just can't think someone could be so \"intolerant.\"   It is like saying a wolf wouldn't dare hurt the sheep,  because it acts very similar to the sheepdog, and even looks like the sheepdog.   Americans are asleep at the wheel!",

Simply put, the typical Democratic Party follower is <b> nothing </b>but a drooling sycophant who desperately needs some one to tell him how to think, and many of this odious ilk have chosen Obama.  Obama hates jews.  His early Muslim upbringing together with the fact that many blacks, rightly or wrongly, consider jews as their economic oppressors, is the source of this hate.  For the extremely limited intelligence required of a Democratic supporter, Obama thinks it so they are happy to think it.",

Take a look at the Democratic roll call in Congress, for being Anti-Semites, they are chuck full of Jews, Einstein. The Democrats have been in power during most of the century, Einstein, to include 2006 to 2010 when they controlled the upper & lower houses of congress, losing the house in 2010 & the Senate in 2014...... 2009 to 2017 they controlled the Executive branch.  Try reading a non partisan book where you will discover that according to history the American Economy has done better under Democratic rule. The democrats are now in control of the house AGAIN & the Senate & executive branch will follow in 2020...  The American Economy follows no other country, they follow the U.S economy...reading would've told you that.  You embarrass yourself.

With freedom of speech under attack,  and \"wrong think\"  being chastised,  the Left are telling us what to say,  think and feel.  \nVery Orwellian indeed...",

Each Abrahamic religion states that only it's adherents will go to heaven, while the rest, incl. the fellow Abrahamic religionists, will be condemned to eternal hell, except for maybe Judaism, which leaves the question of Hell and eternal doom to the personal discretion of the individual Jew or Jewess.",

I seem to remember white nationalist Richard Spencer leading a rally after Trump's election where he led the audience in chants of \"Hail Trump,\" accompanied by fascist salutes.  Watch it here if you haven't seen it:\n\n [LINK] \n\nI also seem to remember Spencer organizing the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville (Unite the RIGHT, not the left), the one Trump couldn't quite bring himself to fully condemn.  You know, the one where the conservatives marched through the streets carrying torches and chanting <b> Nazi </b>slogans such as \"Blood and soil!\" and \"Jews will not replace us.\"  I remember James Allsup, president of the WSU chapter of College Republicans, was there and he posted a video where he almost jizzed his pants when he ran into Richard Spencer, \"Mr. Spencer sir, how can I help you sir, can I direct traffic for you sir.\"  It was humiliating, and put to rest the lie that Republicans and neo-Nazis aren't joined at the hip.  I also remember Allsup in the video speaking highly of KKK grand wizard David Duke, who was also at the Unite the Right rally.  So, both neo-Nazis and the KKK were at the pro-Trump Unite the Right rally.  What does that tell you?\n\nBy the way, do you know about the Enabling Act of 1933?  It was the piece of legislation that gave Hitler dictatorial powers.  The Nazis did not have enough votes in the parliament to pass it on their own, so needed help from other parties.  There were four other major parties in parliament at the time: DNVP (conservative nationalists), Zentrum (conservative Catholics), SPD (socialists), and KPD (communists).  The two conservative parties voted UNANIMOUSLY in favor of the legislation, thus making Hitler dictator.  The SPD voted UNANIMOUSLY against the legislation.  The KPD would have voted against it, but all its members were under arrest or in hiding.  So much for your revisionist BULLSHIT about the Nazis being socialists.",

I presented actual evidence of the socialists and the communists parties opposing the Nazis and the conservative parties supporting them.  Let me repeat the most crucial part:  The socialist lawmakers voted unanimously against the Nazis and the conservative lawmakers voted unanimously for the Nazis.  That is a matter of documented history.  You presented no rebuttal aside from vague assertions.  Then, just as now, Nazis align with the right.  The Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville was sponsored by and/or attended by neo-Nazis and the KKK.  At the rally, they declared their support for Trump.\n\nReally, all you're basing it on is the word \"socialist\" in the <b> Nazi </b>name.  If you knew history, you would know that the more socialist elements in the<b>  Nazi</b> party (notably Ernst Rohm and the SA) were decisively purged during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934.  This purge came at the urging of conservatives within and outside th<b> e Naz</b>i party.  Once it was over, conservatives were firmly in power.  The Nazis had a friendly relationship with business, were anti-communist, against independent unions, aggressively privatized industries that had been nationalized in previous administrations (banks, railways, steel, shipbuilding, utilities, etc.).  No socialist government would undertake aggressive privatization.  Your argument is absurd and ahistorical.",

You sound like you are just normal people but like Joel said the political <b> slant </b>(that Donny has based his existence on) is grabbing you.  Fear is something that needs to be faced by every person personally.  It is so easy to retreat to the camp that claims \"us vs. them\"  because you are with people that say they are on \"your\" side. It is an over used analogy but that is literally how Hitler got a foothold in 1932.  A base of 30% was enough to take over a country when the balance of people teetered on the fence, holding their noses because they needed jobs. \nWhat is missing is empathy.  That doesn't mean feel sorry for them, it means put yourself in their shoes.  \nI have no problem hating people, I have plenty of that but I base it on their actions not their color of skin.  When I see white men walking into churches and synagoges and schools I have to ask who is the enemy here? They look like me.   Fear is where they started.",

            "commentText": "Hm... som1 has influenced & convinced her to change position? Well, I guess due to the fact that around the world people are losing respect for America for wars in middle east & for backing Zionist Israel & allowing for decades the illegal occupation of Jews in Gaza, Golan heights, & the presence of Jewish state police controling by patroling & doing random searches that infringe the activity of Palestinians in public & border places due to the walls Israel have erected that affect the lives of Palestinians. On top of that, the two state solution wasn't taken as a solution by the Palestinians/Arabs as it was forced upon them--this is their sentiment & belief since the start bcoz they felt betrayed by the British (& others via UN decision) as UK had given their word to hand over the land of Jerusalem to the Palestinian Arabs who were living in the Palestinian peninsula during the time of British colony. From then on the story escalates to more conflict & violence as we know it. Prayers must continue to petition God for a peaceful resolution & settlement of the issue that has deeply wounded humanity. Christians should weigh both sides instead of simply taking sides that exacerbate the volatile situation. Can anyone imagine the tension, anxiety & painful uncertainty for the people who live there? How much more for the children?",

In my OPINION, when you take a position or side on a issue during a campaign you are PROMISING the voters that you will keep your word if elected, during the election when she says that we should not support the boycott on Isreal(clearly a lie she said while campaigning to try to get some of the Jewish voters on her side) and then she flips before she even has her first day in office is, again in my OPINION, is breaking a promise.",

How many countries have Palestinians financially helped?  0!  Now let's look at Isreal, in the last 75 years they have established a good military, has produced literally hundreds of top scholars, contributed to creating new groundbreaking medicines and medical research, has created several multimillion dollar componies, has a larger GDP then its three sounding Muslim predominant  countries combined, built an actual society and country all while being constantly attacked by weak and useless Muslims.  I would compare this to a horse <b> race,</b> in gate 1 you have a beautiful thoroughbred stallion (Isreal) and in gate 2 you have a half retarded donkey missing one eye and and its two front legs (Palestinians) which one are you going to put your money on?

I understand that the Koran is very , very clear about Jesus. The Koran says Jesus is a liar and wasn't the son of God. Also Jesus has just gone away and then will return as a converted Muslim . Jesus is thence to go out and do shariah lawn care, that little law of the Muslim from the Koran and the ghost of Mohammed, their precious prophet. The Koran was written 200 years after the child  rapist had died ( Mohammed) . \nConsequently I have not the least bit of doubt that there was never any intention of helping Israel. God's word is true and he has stated if you bless his Israel he will bless you and if you curse Israel he will also curse you for your actions. What is our next punishment to be from the lord for not just allowing this one to turn on Israel, but the truth is that we're backing her and shall be punished for it. You can not be a child of Christ Jesus and a child of the Muslim faith at the same time. Is Jesus your savior or slayer ???",

Most of the people including us do not take Religious ideology seriously and literally, we ain't got no time for that. Our way of life and belief system is shaped by the culture ( sorrounding) we are grown. So if a muslim is born in America, he/she will have American culture because they will be going school with bunch of other kids, make friends and have fun. That is why American muslim are much more secular and moderate than middle eastern Muslim. Just like Russian Christian are different from American Christian because their set of cultures are different even though they have same religion.",

Lol Christianity is the only religion that INVOKED multiple Inquisitions to annihilate the so called heretics, blasphemers, and unbelievers due to these acts not needing to even be invoked in Muslim majority countries, it isn't bigotry nor is it invoked since it happens as if it's natural in these societies. Is it the Christian majority nations that punish people for critiquing or simply questioning religion even on the internet or is it the Muslim majority nations? Is it Christians who will request for the government to punish you if you draw a picture of Jesus or is it Missing? Regarding Christian radicals, I'm almost certain that they're despised by the Christian demographic, find a survey that shows that 20% of Christians in the US or any Christian majority country support their acts instead of condemning their acts.

Which of those 3 want the government to punish you for critiquing religion over the internet? Are a chunk of Sikhs okay with hands being cut off for stealing? Are a chunk of Hindus okay with the government punishing it's citizens for questioning Hinduism? Are Jews okay with stoning for adultery and punishment for leaving Judaism?",

                    "commentText": "You stupid brainwashed fool.\nHow can you call her anti-Semitic? She is likely more Semitic than Netenyahu. The bible says the devil will deceive the world. First of all Semitic is not a group of people it is a family of languages indigenous to Africa. Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, Amharic, Tegri, and about 400 others spoken Africa.\r\nThe Zionists rule our country and have infiltrated the Christian Church. Any bible scholar knows the Jews are descendants from the European Kazarian Kingdom. In 740 AD they converted to Judaism under King Bulan. For hundreds of years they ruled a region between the Caspian and <b> Black </b>Sea. They converted to Judaism the same way Donald Trump's daughter did. These imposters have no genetic, historical, or archeological connections to the Biblical Hebrews. \r\nThe Christian church remains silent because if these European imposters are exposed; then people will ask who and where are the Hebrew Israelites.\r\nFirst of all they would look like Rep. Omar. The biblical Hebrews were Negros. Israel is in Africa despite attempts to redefine it as the middle east. \r\nMoses was raised as Pharaohs Grandson and all the Pharaoh's of that era were Negros. Pharaoh had order the murder of all Hebrew baby boys of Moses<b>  age</b>. Their was no physical differences between Hebrews, Egyptian, and Ethiopian people. When Moses true identity was discovered he fled into the wilderness. While resting at the well he helped the Shepard girls water their flock. When they return home early their father ask them, \" how is it you are back home so soon\". They answered an Egyptian helped us. They thought he was Egyptian because Moses fled with the clothes on his back. He was still wearing Egyptian clothes. Moses married an Ethiopia<b> n woma</b>n. King Salomon and Sheba first born son Maliki became the first King of Ethiopia. \r\nEuropean were desperate to white wash history. For this lie to work they had to make the Egyptians and the Israelites white. This served the Kazarian European Jews and the Christian church. In many European countries that were not invested in the exploitation of Africa and it's people; you fi<b> nd Bla</b>ck Madonna and Messiah.\r\nThe Catholic Church decided to change the image of the Messiah. Pope Alexander VI commission a new European image of the Messiah. It was a big deal so a heated competition between DaVinci and Michelangelo ended with DaVinci winning the contract because he was rumored to be the lover of the Pope's son Cesare Borgia. The image of the Christ that is on a billion pictures is <b> the<b>  </b</b>>gay son of Pope Alexander. \r\nWhy would the Hebrew people ever go to Europe. When threatened they always fled to Egypt and when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans they fled in to south and west Africa where you can find the tribes today. These Africans pass the Genetic test and they still follow Hebrew traditions. \r\nThe very first maps of Africa commissioned by European Kings shows a section of West Africa called the Kingdom of Judah. Now this is where the story gets interesting. When the slave trade started we are told <b> other Af</b>rican sold<b>  other A</b>frican tribes into slavery. The truth that will shatter all we know today is the first slaves brought to the Western Hemisphere were the tribe of Judah. Yes, the hated blacks of the America's are directly decendant of the tribe of Judah.\r\nThe imposter Netenyahu stood before Congress claming Moses led his people, but Moses never went to Poland. Netenyahu whose real name was Millenkosky before his father changed it to sound Hebrew.\r\nSome say they are our allies. I need only point out how they have spied on us for decades and then sold those secrets to our strategic enemies. Russia received the bulk of these secrets in exchange for allowing more Jews to immigrate to Israel.\r\nDuring the Iraq war they were caught trying to steal secrets about our troop placements in Iraq. Intending to assist insurgents kill American troops. Even more dramatic was the 1967 attack on the USS LIBERTY. They made every attempt to sink this ship and blame it on the Egyptians during the Arab Israeli war. The ship was clearly American and many sailors lost their lives as the Israeli Airforce and Navy mercilessly killed many American sailors.\r\nIf you are an American patriot you can not stand by and let this foreign power use us for their evil goals.\r\nJerrod Kushner is a traitor and he is setting us up for conflict with every country around Israel. Iraq, Libya, Iran, Syria must be destroyed and they used ISIS and American to do it. ISIS has attacked Christians and MUSLIMS; but never Israel and no one seems to think something is strange abo<b> ut this te</b>rrorist organization never throwing even one pebble at Israel but swear war on everyone else.\r\nIf you are a Christian please realize they use your love of Jesus to manipulate American politics.\r\nAlso realize Jesus was not the Messiah name and the bible clearly predicted this great identity theft. Revelations 2:9 and 3:9 clearly calls these people as the synagogue of Satan.",

                    "commentText": "@Yisroel Katz That seems kind of absurd. Mandatory Palestine existed as part of the British Empire for almost like half a century, and was occupied by the Ottomans for 100s of years before that. Arabs have been living on that land for nearly as long as Jews have. Intriguingly, a cursory glance at Wikipedia also suggests that the region was majority Christian for a long time before the turn of the 19th century. I don't think anyone should question the right of Israel to exist, since they won it fair and square, but that doesn't mean that you have to demonize the other side either.\n\nI think you should consider this. Dershowitz is being pretty disingenuous when he talks about the \"anti-Semitism of the hard right\". Obviously, that exists, but it's also a massive oversimplification in many cases. Based on your other comments on the vid, you seem to realize that Democrats aren't truly the friends of the Jews. From my reading of history, I don't think that the Jew has ever known a better friend than the white American evangelical Christian, at least in this current era. However, white gentiles are also starting to feel taken advantage of, since as you probably know, the majority of Jews lean liberal, liberals have taken an anti-white turn, and therefore many of those highly visible anti-white liberals are Jews. So, that is where that rise in anti-Semitism, which is real, is coming from. \n\nWhat I would submit to you is that you shouldn't dichotimize us into categories of \"Zionist Christians\" or whatever and the rest as \"neo-Nazis\". Instead, think of it like we want to renegotiate our relationship with the Jews, and try to approach us willing to have that conversation and with understanding as long we're not being overly hostile towards you. That \"special relationship\" between the white gentile and the Jew, whatever has worked for 70 years, obviously isn't working out so well right now. Non-Jewish whites are starting to feel taken advantage of, and that's only human. At the same time, Jews and white Christians together over the last century have built, bar none, the greatest civilization that the world has ever seen, which is why the rest of the world also wants a piece of that pie too. It would be a shame if we had to lose all that. I understand that you seem to be very proud of your people, your culture, and are probably sensitive to any threats to that. Which is an admirable trait. However, there are lots of Jews out there who are willing to make the difficult step of reaching out to us and having those tough conversations, so I just wanted to put it in your head that there are people like me out there and we're not all monsters. Fox News is not all-encompassing of all the conversations happening on the right right now. The powers that be, the ruling class, whomever they may be, divide us into arbitrary categories of Jew, gentile, Christian and atheist and Muslim, white and <b> black,</b> man and<b>  woman</b>, straight an<b> d g<b> a</b</b>>y, etc., and then sell us a poison pill \"diversity\" as a solution to all those problems, but the reality is if we're going to unite and beat those people, it will still involve building bridges of our own as well.\n\nSorry for the rant, but I hope I don't come across as a hateful person, I disagree with some of the rhetoric of very \"anti-Palestian\" Israel supporters but I also admire your passion. :) I would feel much safer with people like you on my side than not if shit ever hits the fan.",

Dershowitz is a Liberal and I am a conservative like many Jews who are conservative in their political beliefs! Orthodox Jews like myself are over 90% conservative in their political beliefs! We are for morality as stated in the Bible! It is only the secular Jews who are Liberal who have disassociated themselves from their heritage and adapted<b>  alien</b> ideas to Judaism! The orthodox Jews are lumped together with these people and we suffer greatly from them! We disagree with them strongly and we do not associate with them! We consider them a separate entity! Now that I informed you of the situation I respect your views and thank you for honesty!",

I agree with you on some things and disagree with you on others, including some of your phraseology. Yes, Palestine is the place where the historic Land of Israel (including the Kingdoms of Judah and Israel) was, yes Arabs have conquered it and lived there since the 7th century, yes Jews have live there alongside the Arabs throughout the history that followed, and yes there was never a country called 'Palestine' or a robustly-defined 'Palestinian people'. Instead there have been Palestinian Arabs and Palestinian Jews, both groups of people equally 'Palestinian'. Yes, now there are a lot more Jews in Israel than non-Jews, and yes, it's a good thing because it allows us to have a national home. Unfortunately, sharing that home with non-Israeli Arabs, including Palestinian Arabs who left Israel in 1948-49 is not only impractical but also impossible. So here's where I guess your worldview and mine differ a bit... There have to be two states; Israeli Arabs who want to live in the Arab state have to be welcome to do so (but no one will, as I am sure you will agree); and while the Arab state should not follow the Green Line, it has to be territorially viable and demilitarized.",

Most Israeli Jews call the day that Likud took over power as \"The day that the terrorists won\" . The Likud party is hand in hand with Satan personified in the Rothschild family and world banking. They kill by the millions. This small group of pure evil people ARENT EVEN JEWS, but say they are. Now, if you criticize the evil that is running Israel, that somehow translates into HATING JEWS IN AMERICA????   It's a stupid trick that only stupid people would fall for. I love Jews. But Netanyahu? Prison for life. If you were evil and had to pick an identity, wouldn't hiding behind Jews be the best place???  They own all the TV Networks, newspapers and magazines. Please, put all MSM down and learn on YouTube. You only have about two more months.  BDS , I'm joining tomorrow",

According to Stefan Wild of the University of Bonn, Hitler's philosophy of National Socialism \u2013 of a state headed by a single, strong, charismatic leader with a submissive and adoring people \u2013 was a model for the founders of the Arab nationalist movement. Arabs favored Germany over other European powers, because \"Germany was seen as having no direct colonial or territorial ambitions in the area. This was an important point of sympathy\", Wild wrote.[1] They also saw German nationhood\u2014which preceded German statehood\u2014as a model for their own movement.\n\nIn October 1938, anti-Jewish treatises that included extracts from Mein Kampf were disseminated at an Islamic parliamentarians' conference \"for the defense of Palestine\" in Cairo.[11][1][12]",

He wasn't unracist, he was just LESS <b> racist </b>than the rest of his party!\ud83d\ude03\nThe bill divided and engendered a long-term change in the demographic support of both parties. President Johnson realized that supporting this bill would risk losing the South's overwhelming support of the Democratic Party. Both Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Vice President Johnson had pushed for the introduction of the civil rights legislation. Johnson told Kennedy aide Ted Sorensen that \"I know the risks are great and we might lose the South, but those sorts of states may be lost anyway.\"\n\nSenator Richard Russell, Jr. later warned President Johnson that his strong support for the civil rights bill \"will not only cost you the South, it will cost you the election\". Johnson, however, went on to win the 1964 election by one of the biggest landslides in American history. The South, which had five states swing Republican in 1964, became a stronghold of the Republican Party by the 1990s.\nPeace!  \ud83d\ude42",

So you studied The protocols of the elders of Zion and concluded ford was just your average american anti-Semitic but he was good at making cars so thats ok. You also wonder why hitler was very close friends with ford? \nNow you blame the news media. Fords cars and crap helped win the war LOL What a fucking tosser!!",

If you'd care to speak to my mother, who survived WW2 and 5 different concentration camps and still to this day has nightmares where she wakes up screaming and crying about being taken away in a cattle car, I invite you to come speak to her in person. I then invite you to try to convince her of your Kumbaya message, because I GUARANTEE you without a shadow of a doubt, HITLER is severely HATED in our family; without the benefit of a formal introduction no less. Therefore, if Henry Ford espoused that same ideology, I think we have a right to HATE him as well without a formal introduction to him either.",

By the way a fun fact, Terrorism in middle east was almost <b> zero </b>until other countries interfered in the greed of oil. I think it is just another dark side of the history. In mid 1900's there was European chaos, wars, refugees and now there is in Middle east. 100 Years from now, there will be somewhere else unfortunately. If you think Muslim people are from different planet, they have different hormones, etc than go and talk to Muslim as a people without assuming he may be a<b>  terrorist</b>. You will realize that they are just like us, they wanna make friends and have a happy life. Most of the victims of Islam is muslims so ofcourse they wanna eradicate terrorism.",

Debunk each one of these facts then.\n\n\nReasons to never trust DEMOCRATS: Democrats fought to expand slavery while Republicans fought to end it. Democrats passed those discriminatory <b> Black </b>Codes and<b>  Jim Cr<b> ow</b</b>> laws. Democrats supported and passed the Missouri Compromise to protect slavery. Democrats supported and passed the Kansas Nebraska Act to expand slavery. Democrats supported and backed the Dred Scott Decision. Democrats opposed educating blacks and murdered our teachers. Democrats fought against anti-lynching laws. Democrats passed the Repeal Act of 1894 that overturned civil right laws enacted by Republicans. Democrats declared that they would rather vote for <b> a \"<b> yel<b> l</b</b</b>>>ow dog\" than vote for a Republican, because the Republican Party was known as \"the party of nig--rs.\" \n\nDemocrat Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia is well known for having been a \"Kleagle\" and a recruiter in the Ku Klux Klan. He personally filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for 14 straight hours to keep it from passage. Democrat Senators Sam Ervin and Albert Gore, Sr. (the father of former Vice President Al Gore) joined him in his efforts to defeat the bill. Democrat President Woodrow Wilson, reintroduced segregation throughout the federal government immediately upon taking office in 1913. Democrat President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first appointment to the Supreme Court was a life-long member of the Ku Klux Klan, Sen.<b>  Hugo </b>Black, (D-AL). Roosevelt's choice for vice president in 1944 was Harry Truman, who was a member of the Kansas City chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in 1922. Roosevelt resisted Republican efforts to pass a federal law against lynching and opposed integration of the armed forces. Democrats supported and backed Judge John Ferguson in the case of Plessy v Ferguson. Democrats supported the School Board of Topeka Kansas in the case of Brown v The Board of Education of Topeka Kansas. \n\nDemocrat public safety commissioner Eugene \"Bull\" Connor, in Birmingham, AL unleashed vicious dogs and turned fire ho<b> ses on</b> black civil rights demonstrators. Democrats were who Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the other protesters were fighting. Democrat Georgia Governor Lester Maddox (1967-1971) \"brandished\" an ax hammer to prevent blacks from patronizing his restaurant. Democrat Governor George Wallace blocked the entrance to an Alabama schoolhouse in 1963. He blocked the doors with his body, declaring that Alabama would be segregated forever. Democrat Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus (1955-1967) fought to keep Little Rock public schools segregated. Democrat Senator John F. Kennedy voted against the 1957 Civil rights Act. As President, Kennedy opposed the 1963 March on Washington by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He also had Dr. King wiretapped and investigated by the FBI. Democrat President Bill Clinton's mentor was U.S. Senator J. William Fulbright, an Arkansas Democrat and a supporter of racial segregation. Clinton served as an intern for Fulbright in 1966-67. Sen. Fulbright signed the Southern \n\nManifesto opposing the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision. He joined with the Dixiecrats in filibustering the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1964 and also voted against the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Southern Democrats opposed desegregation and integration. The Democrat National Party's 1868 slogan was, \"It's a white man's party, let white men rule.\" Democrat Progressive Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, was a white supremacist and attended Ku Klux Klan rallies in order to garner political and financial support. Sanger stated that Planned Parenthood was established in order to control the population of those whom she deemed \"Inferior Races\" (Negros, Jews, Latinos, etc.). Sanger was<b>  also</b> a Nazi sympathizer and a bel<b> iever in </b>Eugenics. Democrats opposed: The Emancipation Proclamation The 13th Amendment The 14th Amendment The 15th Amendment The Reconstruction Act of 1867 The Civil Rights of 1866 The Enforcement Act of 1870 The Forced Act of 1871 The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 The Civil Rights Act of 1875 The Freeman Bureau The Civil Rights Act of 1957 The Civil Rights Act of 1960 The Civil Rights Act of 1964 The Voting Rights Act of 1965 The United State Civil Rights Commission Republicans gave strong bi-partisan support and sponsorship for the following legislation: The Civil Rights Act of 1964 The Voting Rights Act of 1965 \n\nThe 1968 Civil Rights Acts The Equal Opportunity Act of 1972 Goals and Timetables for Affirmative Action Programs Comprehensive Employment Training Act of 1973 Voting Rights Act of Amendment of 1982 Civil Rights Act of 1983 Federal Contract Compliance and Workforce Development Act of 1988 The Republicans: Republicans enacted civil rights laws in the 1950's and 1960's, over the objection of Democrats. Republicans founded the HBCU's (H<b> istori</b>cal Black Colleges and Universities) and started the NAACP to c<b> ounter </b>the racist practices of the Democrats. Republicans pushed through much of the ground-breaking civil rights legislation in Congress. Republicans fought slavery and amended the Constitution to grant blacks freedom, citizenship and the right to vote. Republicans pushed through much of the groundbreaking civil rights legislation from the 1860s through the 1960s. Republican President Dwight Eisenhower sent troops into the South to desegregate the schools. Republican President Eisenhower appointed Chief Justice Earl Warren to the Supreme Court, which resulted in the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen from Illinois, not Democrat President Lyndon Johnson, was the one who pushed through the civil rights laws of the 1960's. \n\nRepublican Senator Everett Dirksen from Illinois wrote the language for the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen from Illinois also crafted the language for the Civil Rights Act of 1968 which prohibited discrimination in housing. Rep<b> ublica</b>n and black American, A. Phillip Randolph, organized the 1963 March by Dr. King on Washington. The Ku Klux Klan was established after Southern Democrats lost the Civil War to the Republican Party. They were thought of as the \"militant arm\" of the Democrat Party and sought to<b>  kill </b>former Black slaves, <b> Iri<b> sh <b> sla</b</b</b>>>ves, Oriental Slaves & the Republicans who freed them all. The late Senator Robert Byrd (D-W VA) recruited for the KKK. The Democratic Party gave us t<b> he Ku </b>Klux K<b> lan, Bl<b> ac</b</b>>k Codes, Jim Crow Laws and other repressive legislation which resulted in the multitude of murders, lynching, mutilations, and intimidatio<b> ns (of</b> thousands of black and white Republicans). On the issue of slavery: historians say the Democrats gave their lives to expand it, the Republicans gave their lives to ban it<b> . \"--The K</b>KK was the terrorist wing of the Democrat Party.--\" The 1964 Civil Rights Act Roll Call Vote: In the House, only 64 percent of the Democrats (153 yes, 91 no), but 80 percent of the Republicans (136 yes, 35 no), voted for it. In the Senate, while only 68 percent of the Democrats endorsed the bill (46 yes, 21 no), 82 percent of the Republicans voted to enact it (27 yes, 6 no). \n\nThaddeus Stevens, a Radical Republican that introduce<b> d legisl</b>ation to give African Americans the so-called 40 acres and a mule and Democrats overwhelmingly voted against the bill. During the Senate debates on the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, it was revealed that members of the Democr<b> atic Party</b> formed many terrorist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan t<b> o murder</b> and intimidate African Americans voters. The Ku Klux Klan Act was a bill introduced by a Republican Congress to stop Klan Activities. History reveals that Democrats lynched, burned, mutilated and murdered thousands of blacks and completely destroyed entire towns and communities occupied by middle class Blacks, including Rosewood, Florida, the Greenwood District in Tulsa Oklahoma, and Wilmington, North Carolina to name a few. History reveals that it was Abolitionists and Radical Republicans such as Henry L. Morehouse and General Oliver Howard that started<b>  many </b>of the traditional Black colleges, while \n\nDemocrats fought to keep them closed<b> . Many</b> of our traditional Black colleges are named after white Republicans. After exclusively giving the Democrats their votes for the <b> past 25 </b>years, the average African American cannot point to one piece of civil rights legislation sponsored solely by the Democratic Party that was specifically designed to eradica<b> te the u</b>nique problems that African Americans face today",

Do you think your garbage is collected by the boy scouts? I live in what used to be steel country and the mob is still hang on to what is left. In my state as early as six years ago Democrats was threatening people at the election poles. History repeats itself and when I seen Hillary on TV saying the Democrats will do whatever it takes to regain control I had flash backs. A few years ago antifa was demanding the sheriff offices in my state to release records on people with CCW permits so these people could be targeted, for what reason we still don't know. We have seen an up swing in anti-Semitic behavior. This also coincides with Obama bring in large numbers of Muslims. These Muslims are not choosing the Republican Party. Antifa, a democratic supposed organization, os constantly trying to violate freedom of speech. This is happening today. An other reason for a history lesson it because every single person of color tries to use it to justify their <b> racist </b>mentality, but when it is used to reflect habitual of a political party snowflakes have meltdowns. So make up your mind are we going to have a history discussion or not? Now you know why Obama tried hard to rewrite history, because Democrats was on the wrong side. \"The wrong side of history\" was a term used by Democrats to convince people that republicans are<b>  racist</b>. Makes Democrats look a little fascist, doesn't it? You know I'm not even a republican, I'm just tired of being slandered by liberals. Democrats have controlled my state for 80 years I know how they really are.",

Have you gone from claiming that intentions are unimportant to claiming that intentions are all that matter? \nAnd i just want to be clear about this one more time. There are few things that would push me to be physically violent with someone. If you are gonna go around telling toxic, evil lies, saying the synagogue shooter was a leftist, then yes, I would smack the shit out of you. No apologies",

His actions were reprehensible, and ar<b> e nothin</b>g that I would ever think was ok or support from any one on any side at any time.  If 'my side' ever claimed in any way that it was, it would no longer be 'my side'.\n\nYou, however, seem to have your panties in a bunch  about making sure his ideology isn't tangled with your's.\n\n You didn't even look for the actual reasons and actions which have caused to defame all Republicans and Trump <b> as raci</b>st, at least on of the reasons you seem to be so intent on this, but you still see no issue in continuing to think it's true.  If it's true, you should be able to find it easily.\n\nYou have virtually the entire set of all recorded history and knowledge at your fingertips and you'd prefer to grouse about some nut case's political affiliations.  30 years ago, that was a pipe dream.  I could do research papers today , in one night, that took me a month 30 years ago.  We used to have to go to the library, pour over microfilm, read every periodical found in a 100 mile radius, and order books, and still not be as thorough as I could right now.  What a waste.\n\nGood luck with your life, and really, don't slap people, you have no idea what you might get.  It's been fun, but unless you actually have something to say that doesn't sound like a CNN teleprompter, I'm all done, the thread is too long.",

                    "commentText": "Correct! I might want to point out though that this is in terms of the full number of dead, not the frequency of attacks.  Remember, the only reason for that particular number of Right Wing attacks to be so high, is due to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. It's the second deadliest <b> terrorist </b>attack in U.S. history, killed 168 people and accounted for 77% of all the murders committed by Nationalist and Right Wing terrorists since 1992! There generally aren't a lot of politically motivated attacks in the US and that makes this a pretty crude statistic as it is difficult to measure. Daniel Vincent Mentioned earlier that he had no interest for left wing attacks or KKK attacks that happened decades ago, therefor it wouldn't be fair to put focus on Nationalist and Right Wing terrorists attacks that happened almost 30 years ago either! If one where to look at it from a broader perspective and go further back in time to Southern Democrats and Ku Klux Klan attacks, the result would look different. If one where to put all politically motivated attacks together from the last centuries and compare Left and Right Wing motivated attacks, there probably would not be a huge difference anyway, and most people on both the left and the right would denounce all these attacks despite which ideology inspired them anyway. I just brought this up as there seemingly was an interest for the most recent politically motivated attacks. I found it to be more relevant to this particular discussion.",

You, me, and everybody else should vote for the best person, regardless of the political party. One of the main issues in USA is that people vote for the party and not for the person. \nAbout the drug issue. In my experience the states that have done the most to help with the drugs issues are liberal states, California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado that have legalized marijuana and that helped to reduce murderers and violent crime for more than 20%. I don't know about the problem in WV(and I'm pretty sure that you know more than me) but, until now the only solution to drugs is : making legals or stop criminalizing possession. I think that republicans are \"more\" conservatives (in average) and they don't agree with that idea.\nFor you other points, it's very good that some problems are being solved, I truly mean that. \nAnd last, I'm not democrat not republican, I''ll consider myself a libertarian in the real sense of the word, as Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Milton Friedman etc. I said this just to point that I'm not democrat, because I don't like the way that you are generalizing about that democrats are corrupt and republicans help people.

The left has gone too far left for any sane, hard working, middle of the road person to even understand. When some nut case does something to hurt other people you damn liberals start screaming about how violent and dangerous republican white males are, and screaming Trumptards, the Democrats are going to save us all with socialism, legalizing drugs of all kinds because addiction is a disease. Ban all the guns so only the gangs will have them. All the conservatives I know are not robing people so they can shoot up. They have CCW permits and follow ever gun law on the books. They are small businesses owners and others work hard at their careers. If I have to swing in one direction it will be to the right. If I look back over the decades to see who has done me the most harm and who is unhinged enough to do some<b> thing </b>crazy and unpredictable it always come back to be a liberal. I have never know a conservative to be involved in a drive by.",

The drug problem is the crime derived from making it illegal. Legalize drugs is not a good solution, but at least is not that bad as making it illegal. That was problem when <b> alcohol </b> was illegal in the 1920s.\nAgain, I'm not a leftist , but about Trump , well, that guy is literally a<b>  racist</b>, liar that doesn't care if he lies, because he will lie about the lie that he said. Someone that praises dictators like Putin, the guy from north korea, the one from China etc. By any stretch  of the imagination Trump is person that respects the fundamental values of the Constitution about freedom , separation of power in government etc. He thinks that people should obey him I rig the game for it. Seriously, Trump, for me is at the bottom of the bottom. But if someone supports him , I'll like to know why. If they said, Trump after Hillary, ok, I maybe can understand that, but otherwise it doesn't make any sense for me.\nThe point about the drugs addict and who is running it, I don't agree. Alabama and some of the states in the south are the poorest in the country. Those states are run almost by republicans. If fact, if you  can say something is that the richest cities in the country are all left. New York, San Francisco, Seattle etc. Sure, you can say the same for poorest places, but I will debate that a little more. \nI agree fully with you about Antifa and other groups, but those people are very far to the left. The middle of the republican party is to far to the right. And , I don't know if you have notice this, but the whole world, is moving to the left, academy, industries etc, and the american right is way , way far to the right.",

I'll like that people pass an exam, as we do with cars and other things. I'll like that people are responsible if something happens with their guns, because maybe someone stole it and killed someone. You have to report that, but if you don't do anything you should be responsible for that . Exactly how? we can discuss this more in depth, but that doesn't imply that I want to ban guns. \nAnd remember almost all the gangs in USA are because of drugs. Legalize all drugs and half the violent crime will disappear.  If you think that government should not limit you to have guns, also shouldn't limit you from use drugs, it's the same principle.",

                    "commentText": "rey well to start with the real reason the left has gone nuts. Trump. The crooked Clinton's screwed over Bernie, but that is OK because Bernie is a full blown Socialist. We can't have socialism in the US because it never worked in the past it will never work in the future. Socialized medicine is a different story. That works great in all the other industrialized nations. Hillary lost because of two reasons. First no one wanted an other Clinton in office then she threatened to destroy fossil fuels. With <b> nothing </b>to replace it with. When she said that she lost Ohio and Pennsylvania. She cut her own throat. You can't blame Trump for being in the right place at the right time. With the combination of the east sitting on the largest reserve of natural gas ever discovered. Republicans loosening the restrictions on the industry and the introduction of right to work laws. If you have not noticed, anyone that wants a job can have a good one. Trump's and republicans policies have created over 4 million jobs in a year and a half. For the first time in West Virginia sense WWII there are more jobs than sober people to fill them. Sense Trump has become president my income has more than doubled, real companies have came into my state because of right to work laws and I have the best health insurance I have ever had. Because I have seen this happen first hand I will vote for Trump in 2020. Right now I know of a dozen companies and plants beginning for drug free employees with pay and benefits to reflect that need. Democrats and unions could not do this in my life time. As far as legalizing drugs. For starters weed is not a drug it is an herbal supplement. Like mushrooms. I think people should be able to grow it like tomatoes and green beans. If people have open access to heroin they would be dying in the parking lots. We have a bad heroin problem and non junkies are not getting ambulance and first responder help that they need because they are all being use for overdoses. Can you imagine if you could walk into a store and buy LSD? I know alot about drugs, I have done my share of partying and I know people are to stupid to do drugs. In the tristate area where I live drugs are a small part of gang activity. Human trafficking is big. If you legalize all natural drugs that is great, weed is better for everyone than beer is. However you would have to crack down hard on the use, distribution and manufacturing of hard drugs. Get off the idea that addiction is a disease. You can't have people buying meth at the flea market. As far as guns go, let's start enforcing the laws already on the books. You can require people to take classes and qualification tests only if they are going to carry. You can't do it for ownership. Once you do that the government can change one little thing in the requirements and then violate the second amendment. I think making it 21 to but any firearm is a very good idea. All school shootings in the past 25 years have been done by kids under the<b>  age</b> of 21. Kids are just not as responsible as they used to be. States need to update certain laws. The school shooting in Florida by a 20 yea<b> r ol</b>d formal student. He had 30 or so domestic violence calls from his mom. In WV you have one call you loose your right to own a gun. You can pass laws to restrict law biding people from owning, using and carrying fire arms. Although I don't support the idea, cities should have different gun laws than non over populated areas. But to get back to Trump. I have not seen anything that tells me he is<b>  a raci</b>st. I am going off of what I kno<b> w a rac</b>ist to be. Not the sheltered, politically correct, liberal arts degree definition. You see in WV for example the grand dragon of the KKK would be drug behind a puck up truck for the simple fact that only fags wear purple. So you can't call pe<b> ople ra</b>cist if you don't even know what it is. I have followed politics sense Carter was president. I have never seen a politician that doesn't lie. Like car salesman, you just know they are lying to you.",

That statement is misleading. The average number of jobs per month created under Trump is lower than during Obama. In fact, Trump hasn't done anything , since 2010 all the numbers(jobs, unemployment, etc) in the economy have been improving. What Trump does is the same that always have done, take credit for things that he didn't accomplish. And also I will go a little further to tell you that even Obama wasn't the direct responsible for the state of the economy. In fact, we can attribute that to Yanet Allen , that was the head of the Federal Reserve during all of these years and was the one who implemented a excellent monetary policy. So, even if Hillary was the president or McCain or Bernie, the economy will stay more or less the same. The best job that a president can do for the economy is to not intervene. Also, you are not talking about the tariff that Trump have made that are costing billions to the economy and tax payers, because of his protectionist mentality. \n\nIt's true that all politician lies. We do to. Almost everyone care about the truth, they will hide that lie, or try to deny it, because they care about what you think. But Trump and his people, they don't care about , they will lie, constantly, they will make fact in the air, they would lie directly to your face about the lie that they said. Look, suppose that you have a couple and that person is cheating on you. The normal thing is that they will deny it, because at some level the \"respect\" you. So, they will try no to do it again or be more careful. That is what a regular politician does. But now, suppose that the person cheated on you in front of your face. So you confront her and <b> nothing </b>happens. Again they will do it in your face, because they don't care about you opinion. And this is what Trump and his people does. And in my opinion, this is very dangerous, because for them there is no difference between true and lies. \n\nAlso, look at what he does as president. He only goes to Fox News, because they trait him polite. How many interviews have had Trump with CNN, New York times etc. That is very wrong, he his doing the same that dictators do, and it's be interviewed by people that support you. Look at Obama, Bush, Clinton, Reagan, etc, all of them have done several interviews with people of the opposite side, and have defended their points of view. If you think that that is not dangerous  i think that you don't understand how easy is to brake democracy and the american idea of freedom.",

I am living a middle class life now because of right to work laws. Trump is not my first choice as a president, I didn't even vote for him however he is all we had. Sure I wish I could resurrect Ross Perot. To tell me Trp is a <b> racist </b>you have to give me an example, because O don't see it. The media is just so bias they just attack. Trump is not going to be a dictator because you can only have two terms. The only reason Trump is on office is because there is no one else to vote for.\n         There is a veteran from the southern coal fields of West Virginia, he is a democrat he ran for something and lost. I don't know what because I live on the North and didn't care. He claims he is going to run for the presidency. Maybe just maybe someone will be worth voting for in 2020. Until then I support Trump because he is picking Supreme Court Justices I like. People just need to calm down and remember there will be an other election.

And yes, even white Democrats who are not all in with the 'resist and obstruct' strategy are now c<b> onsider</b>ed racist. \n\nHere are a few out of thousands of examples of the left <b> display</b>ing racism.\n\nDon Lemon who recently said, \"The biggest threat to this Country, are white men\". \n\n [LINK] \n\nOr how the left and journalists from leftist news networks, take Trumps words of \"considering himself a nationalist\", twist his words, and call him a white nationalist. \n\n [LINK] \n\nMichael Eric Dyson constantly calling white people names like in this video where he calls Jordan Peterson a quote \"mean mad white man\".\n\n [LINK] \n\nMichael Eric Dyson using white pri<b> vilege </b>as a racist generalized reason why \"WHITE\" people should make 'individual reparations accounts'.\n \n [LINK] \n\nOr just the general leftist citi<b> zens sp</b>ewing racist hatred.\n\n [LINK] \n\n [LINK] \n\n [LINK] \n\n [LINK] \n\n [LINK] \n\nThese are not even considered far leftists by the mainstream left, as this IS the mainstream left today!\nIn collusion with liberal mainstream media journalists, the Democratic Party is attempting, through<b>  the </b>prism of race, to redefine our country. It's clear who's the real racists! \n\nLet me ask<b>  you, h</b>ow many racist Storie do you hear coming out from some of the most conservative states like Vermont, Main, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Kansas etc. NON! It all comes from states like California, New York, Maryland, Oregon, Washington state etc. Reason is the left i<b> s obs</b>essed with race, and t<b> hat in </b>itself IS racist! And some of the worst of it it comes from gr<b> oups l</b>ike Antifa, Black Lives Matter, MeeToo spouting hatred for white males usually! They support Socialist values like open borders, Gun control, High taxes and large government in general, and in spite of their social justice policies being the same as those of Hitler, Mao, Mussolini, Stalin etc. (esp. Mussolini, as his specific goal was to create a welfare state in Italy, which would function both as an instrument of social justice and an instrument of social control) the left and the Mainstream media don't renounce these groups. Why? Because they support the same values (most do so probably without even being aware)! The right on the other hand constantly denounce all of these groups, including the KKK and the Alt Right as well! So the democratic party indeed has changed and they don't hold views of democratisme anymore, and this switch is something that has happened just recently, cause both Obama and Hilary used to hold democratic views.\n\nConservative states seem more low profile, because right leaning people and conservatives look positively at life and are more happy with whatever the current situation might be, they wish to preserve culture, and they openly love America! The left and the progressives on the other hand, look at America as flawed and even evil! This is why the left freaks out when the president says he's a Nationalist, cause oooh we wouldn't want a president that likes his country, and puts America first! And they think Americ<b> a is fu</b>ndamentally racist, so Trump being a Nationalist mus<b> t thus </b>make Trump a racist. That is the thinking of the left, and it's why Ami Horowitz (in the video below) can walk out in California with an American flag, and almost everybody without exception will look down on him and spout hatred for the flag!\n\n [LINK] \n\n\"People in the extreme left are the new PC people, with their own nonsense, but certainly they oppose to the KKK\" - NO! Extreme left or far leftism, is Socialism and Communism, which is where most of the left is at right now! And Socialism is as far left as you can go with maximum sized centralized government controlling the means of production. Whereas Libertarianism (where my views mostly lie) is probably as far right as you can go, meaning absolute basic minimal government, maximizing individual freedom. A great contrast is that the ideology of Socialism has killed, and is killing to this day, billions of people! Famous dictators such as Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, Mao etc. all killed between 25 to 70 million people each, and socialism is the direct causality of it. Whereas Libertarianism or even Conservatism on the other hand are responsible for 0 deaths! Basically speaking, the further right you go, the smaller the government size gets, and when government is small and insignificant, it obviously won't have power to turn tyrannical or invade foreign countries. You might say, the further right you go, the more peace is granted. Switzerland is a good example. It may be the most capitalistic country on earth, it has one of the smallest governments in the world and hasn't had any invasions or tyrannical governments for more than 600 years.\n\nI would like to recommend this video below for you, where Dennis Prager makes the difference between Liberals and Leftists clear. Like the video or not, but PragerU has very high approval ratings and are very accredited.\n\n [LINK] ",

He clearly said Illegal immigrants! You are twisting his words!\n\n \"-He uses the gang MS-13 to disparage all immigrants.\" - In what way has he done so? As an<b>  immigrant</b>, I'm pleased to hear he cares about national safety and security. When he speaks of MS-13, he makes it very clear! Hopefully, you as well would want to see Gang-members who are known to viciously slaughter people get deported or locked up. \n\n-In June 2017, Trump said 15,000 recent immigrants from Haiti 'all have AIDS' and that 40,000 Nigerians, once seeing the.\" -  First of all, there is no proof of him saying this and the White House has denied that he said this! And you may not be aware, but Nigeria is a country not <b> a rac</b>e! \n\nWhere is t<b> he Raci</b>sm in anything you just cited? Do you even understand the w<b> ord rac</b>ism? A person who shows or feels discrimination or prejudice against people of other races, or who believes that a partic<b> ular </b>race is superior to another.\nWhy would you even insinuate h<b> e's a r</b>acist in the first place? You sound like a very kind person, but if you have these things from Brainwashing CNN or MSNBC I would urge you to look around for news sources from both the left and the right! They constantly try and paint hi<b> m as a </b>racist, even though he's never been accused o<b> f being</b> racist until he started running for president!<b>  If he'</b>s racist then why would he hire, elect and <b> work w</b>ith black Americans like Ben <b> Carson a</b>nd colored people in general. He's always been well known for his close relationship<b> s with</b> many black rappers. I don't remember this perfectly well, but he also won that reward back in the 80s for being the first one to provide some sort of special <b> care for</b> the African American workers working under him. There is also the well known story of when he free of charge provided Jenifer Hudson and some of her relatives shelter at the Trump holdings after her family was gruesomely murdered in Chicago.\nThe same people who denounce Trum<b> p for b</b>eing a racist, hypocritically oppose Trump's plan for better scho<b> ol opt</b>ions for black children. There have been liberal commentators comparing Trump to George Wallace, the late Alabama governor who defended school segregation and stood in front of the white public schools with armed gua<b> rds to</b> keep the black children out. Trump is advancing the idea of school choice so that every child can attend a quality school, public or private. In cities such as Washington, D.C., and Milwaukee, the children who benefit from voucher and scholarship programs a<b> re pre</b>dominantly black. Trump wants to increase by tenf<b> old th</b>e number of black children who benefit from these vouchers and scholarships. And with that story where Donald Trump sent his own jet across the country, to pick up a sick child with family and medical people and then flew to NYC where the youngster got life saving treatment. Then flew everyone back to the west coast! All because the mother contacted him. Commercial airlines would not help the kid. No profit for Donald Trump and it probably costed Trump $70,000 each way in fuel and other expenses. With such stories, there Is no denying his hu<b> ge gen</b>erosity.\nThe black unemployment rate has fallen by a full percentage poin<b> t in t</b>he last year, black labor force participation is <b> up and</b> the number of black Americans with a job has risen by 600,000 from last year. <b> Prelim</b>inary data show black wages and incomes are up since the election. The rate of job growth per month for blacks under Trump has so far been 40 percent higher than the monthly average under \u200eObama. Trump has aver<b> aged n</b>early 30,000 new black jobs per month. That's especially remarkable because Obama was elected when employment was way down. We now have the lowest ever recorded unemployment r<b> ates in </b>the US for both African Americans and Hispanics. \nI have yet to hear a legitimate reason why <b> Preside</b>nt trump would be racist and with these things above in mind, I'm gonna say he's the very opposite!",

Those things are a primary concern of people in the republican party\". You directly insinuate that the KKK are republicans or at least they align with them. To insinuate, is just a way to get around directly saying something. Maybe this isn't really what you meant to say, but it is what you wrote.   \n\nMinimum wage is just another thing to suppress economic freedom. Sanders wants to raise the minimum wage? Well that just once again shows how deluded he is! In fact all the countries that Bernie Sanders praise like Denmark(where I'm from), Sweden and Norway don't have a minimum wage! \n\n\"You said that as you move to the extreme right more peace is granted. That is completely false. I share almost all ideas of the libertarian idea, but libertarian is not far right. Far right is<b>  nationalism</b>, protectionism<b> , racis</b>m, racial superiority.\" - I apologize if I wasn't clear! And looking at what I wrote I completely acknowledge I wasn't! I'm somewhat making a generalization. What I mean is the further right you go, the less government is favored contrary to the further left you go, the more government is favored. Therefor I put Libertarianism at the very end of the left-right spectrum as they advocate for less government than any other ideology. In Fact, traditionally they want to get rid of the federal government entirely. The Left-wing politics and right-wing politics are often presented as opposed! I didn't mean to refer to the \"far-right\" (or extreme right). But Far right and far left are not much different from each other, as they both promo<b> te raci</b>sm and fascisms, segregating the populous and punishing the ones that oppose the government or people of certain skin colors and religions. Non of them therefor support small government. They both support big government to an extend where they could control the people, and I would even argue that the \"Far-Right\", is far left on the left-right spectr<b> um. National</b>ism does not belong under the \"far right\" though! Do a little research and you'll find it's normal right wing politics! \n\n\"The reason why Switzerland hasn't attacked anyone is because they have only 8 million people and are a very small country.\" Sorry mate that is completely falls! Britains population was only 3.5 million people in the 16th century when they set out to concur the world, and they succeeded controlling half of it for hundreds of years. 70 percent of the Chinese population is either of Korean or Japanese descent. Despite the much larger population in China, these countries have numerous times invaded China and controlled vast areas of China. You may not know this, but my Country (Denmark), used to consist of both Denmark, England, Norway and Sweden and a big part of Germany. Despite the tiny population of Denmark, which was much smaller when the vikings where around, whey where able to go to war with these countries and win! And in more recent history, all the countries in EU have small populations, yet all but 2 countries (Switzerland and Sweden) have been invaded or have had tyranny numerous times just in the last 100 years! And it's not a coincidence that both Sweden and Switzerland along with the US (Which hasn't had tyranny or invasions at all), has the highest rates of gun ownership in the world! Switzerland being the most interesting one, with more than 45 firearms per 100 people and more than 35 per 100 people of those, are either Simi or fully automatic military firearms. Switzerland remains the only country in the world where any citizen above 18 y<b> ears</b> old, after going through the background checks, can buy modern fully automatic firearms (Something you can't even do in the<b>  US)! N</b>obody dares to invade a country where almost every male citizen is armed! It is also for this reason the Japanese chose not to do a land invasion in the US. As Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto said \"'We did indeed know much about your preparedness. We knew that probably every second home in your country contained firearms. We knew that your country actually had state championships for private citizens shooting military rifles. We were not fools to set foot in such quicksand''. The safest countries also tend to be the most conservative countries that reject Socialism. Countries like the US and Switzerland. I think it's as simple as that! \n\n\"The problem is that the american constitution doesn't apply to other countries, so the government can do a lot of shit. \" I think it's simply because the US government has grown too large, and technically it shouldn't be allowed to make a simple move without the consent of the people, voting yes or no for whatever bill or change is being suggested! \n\n\"Bernie could not do that if he were president, congress won't allow that. And I think that I could do a better job as president, and I'll prefer him than Trump., because at least is more honest\" - One of the reasons Trump was elected is the fact because he speaks from his heart. No teleprompters! Which in most people eyes makes him more trustable. Why don't you find him trustable? So far he has provided and achieved almost everything he promised! \nI find Bernie Sanders to be a much more untrustworthy person than even Hilary Clinton. Bernie Sanders praised Venezuela 20 years ago, and he conveniently praised it right until it failed! He even said he thought it was a good thing, that the Venezuelan population was dependent on the government, having to line up to get food from the government. And recently, Sanders said quote \"When I'm talking about Democratic Socialism, I'm Not looking at Venezuela! I'm looking at counties like Denmark and Sweden.\" Except that all nordic countries are marked based Capitalist countries! In fact there is not one single 1st world country that is a socialist country! Bernie Sanders is either deluded or a liar saying these things. With all the educations he's got, and socialism being his major and expertise, he certainty would know this basic knowledge, that even I random guy behind a computer knows! \n\n\"By the way, the most \"capitalistic \" country is Hong Kong, as Milton Friedman said: \"Hong Kong is the best example of laissez-faire capitalism \". Look at the index of\" I'm sure when Friedman was around this was true, and maybe it still somewhat is. But I've lived and worked in Hong Kong, and since China has taken control of it, they have broken all the agreements with the Brits, and are slowly taking full control! I know several people that have fled from Hong Kong because of this. They are for the first time ever imposing corporate taxes, changing the laws and I even believe they are taking control of the Military, not sure about that last one though. \nAs for the index ratings, you really can't trust many of those as they tend to be completely flawed! An example would be freedom index ratings always putting countries like Germany, Britain and Sweden higher than the US, even though they are countries where thousands are arrested, punished, jailed, fined etc. for practicing basic rights such as free speech and self defense! It's horrifying that cases such as what's happening with Tommy Robinson, is just one of 12 every day in the UK alone! These countries have 10 times more regulations and laws than most states in the US have, equaling less freedom! Yet these \"Professionals\" still put the US far down on the list. It simply doesn't make sense! \n\nI'm sorry for jumping into a completely different subject, but for anybody that sees this reply, If you aren't informed on the Tommy Robinson case, I urge you to look it up, so you can see how countries like the UK treats it's citizens when they arrest them for speech! \n\nGo to 7.40 in the video below where Tommy starts talking about his latest prison visit (most of it spend in solitary), for saying something the government didn't like. \n [LINK]   \n\nOr watch this video for the short version.\n [LINK] \n\nIf you've watched this video, remember, Tommy is statistically just 1 out of 12 people every day having to deal with this, in this case in the UK!\n\nI'm really sorry if you think I write too much. I just can't help but get detailed and I intend to address it all.",

                    "commentText": "Large, indeed :). At least all ideas are is split between paragraphs. I'll follow the same format than you to answer.\n\nCountries like  Sweden and Norway, Denmark don't need minimum because in part the don't have the level of immigration that US has. It has been documented that low skilled immigration affects mainly low paying jobs, therefore the supply of people for those job increase. So , in a country(developed) were you don't have immigration , the \"supply\" of low skilled people tend to decrease with time. I don't agree that MW should be set at the federal level, but I would like that different states try it. For example, here in Washington state the MW is 11.50 and the unemployment is very low, around 4%. So, for me if you raise the MW and the unemployment stay the same and <b> nothing </b>changes is good. Even when is true, that in the technical sense is suppression of \"economic freedom\", in fact, I thing that suppression of \"economic freedom\" is a little exaggerated, because for the person that is working on that there is no freedom. Also , remember that the market is not perfect, is the least bad of all solutions that we know. \n\nWhen I refereed to the example of Switzerland  and its population, also I was referring to the fact, that compared with other countries is not that powerful. England, in its moment conquer half of the world because was the most powerful<b>  nation</b>, as US is right now. Even if the state is small, national defense is owned by the state, I think that function is one of the basic functions for the state from the point of view of libertarians. But made the population vote for the decisions in a large country is very difficult. In my opinion the only way that you can avoid that the US government attacks other places is make a constitutional amendment to only attack in case of invasion or if a super majority on congress vote for that. \n\nAbout Hong Kong. I'm only talking about economic freedom, not press not political freedom. In fact you don't need political freedom to achieve economic freedom, Chile was an example, as Singapore is right now or Hong Kong. Those index of freedom of press etc are not made as the index of economic freedom is done. Those are made by surveys etc. The index of economic freedom take into account 5 factors: taxes, size of government , business freedom etc. It's not perfect but is widely used by a lot of economist etc. I agree also that since China took over Hong Kong economic freedom has decreased, but even right now, they are way more economically freedom that USA, low taxes, no tariff for importation nor exportation , very small government(something interesting is that Hong provides health care mainly through government), small deficit etc. \n\nNow about Trump and Sanders etc. Because Sander supported a place like Venezuela in some point you cannot discard him. Everyone at some points of their life support people that have done wrong things. Right now, you have Trump supporting the government of Saudi Arabia even when the US intelligence agencies have said that were they. But, he doesn't care if Saudi Arabia killed and ripped apart a journalist. For me that is way more dangerous than Sanders supporting Venezuela few years ago. This goes to the core of freedom and your principles. Something that I think that Trump doesn't have. Also, when Sanders supported the Venezuelan government was because in 3 years Hugo Chavez make Venezuela almost an illiteracy free country and brought down a lot of corruption and poor people in Venezuela started to have better life conditions. The problem with the ideology of Venezuela and Cuba etc, is that in the first few years everyone sees an improvement, but in the long term thing got worse, at least this is my opinion coming from <b> a communis</b>t country :).\nI think let me also point this. Venezuela was moving in the same direction than Cuba, with<b>  a communi</b>st party and full control of everything. That was socialism at the extreme. \nWhen Bernie or me talk about countries like Sweden , Denmark etc, is to have a social safety net for people in the bottom, health care, and few basic services. That is fully compatible with a free market system. For me, these should be the main roles of a government in a free society: Army,police etc to protects their citizen , court of law were individuals can resolve their conflicts and what between all of us and voluntarily we cannot achieve. \n\nLet me see the videos about Tommy Robinson and then I will reply :)",

                    "commentText": "\u200b@rey  - I won't argue with your first reply, as I agreed with most of it. But in the next one you are factually wrong!\n\n\"You said that \"the more conservatives countries are the safest\". Seriously, that is completely false. US has the highest crime rate country among the developed nations. It's around 5 deaths per 100 000 people. For example, Canada has 1.3 , UK 0.9, Spain 0.7 , Switzerland 0.7 etc.\" First of all Switzerland is far more Conservative and capitalistic than the US, so this ones again proves my point! But to compare a large superpower with 50 sovereign states, to small EU countries in such a generalizing manner obviously doesn't make any sense. The Tenth Amendment expresses the principle of federalism and states' rights, which strictly supports the entire plan of the original Constitution for the United States of America, by stating that the federal government possesses only those powers delegated to it by the United States Constitution. All remaining powers are reserved for the states or the people. This is why every US state is almost as different from each other, as the different countries in Europe. Every state is unique in its own way. They have their own governments, laws, culture, nature, accents, climate etc. Hence, the statistic you have presented, is profoundly generalized. When digging into those crude stats, which only reveals the median numbers of the US, you'll find many negative numbers, but you'll also find much better numbers! First of all general violent crime rate is rated higher in EU than the US. And states like South Dakota, Minnesota, Vermont, North Dakota, Montana, Main, New Hampshire, Iowa, Idaho Wyoming Utah etc. are very peaceful states with low crimes rates and they all have some of the lowest murder rates in the entire world all below 3 out of 100,000 people! And the ones with the lowest are New Hampshire 0.9 in 2014,    North Dakota was rated at 0.6 in 2000, South Dakota was rated at 0.9 in 2000, Maine rated at 1.2 in 2000, Vermont 1.1 in 2010 etc. Some of them have increased and decreased over the years, but they are non the less extremely low, and only a couple other countries have similar low numbers. And ones again non of any of the states mentioned are left leaning states. The countries in EU with the lowest murder rates are Austria and Switzerland (Which also happens to be the most conservative) and the states in the US with the lowest crime and murder rates, as proven, are also among the most conservative US states. \n\n\"China has less level of crime and murdered than USA. I only said this because every time that I ask a Chinese about this they said that they feel safer in China\" - Sorry mate you can't win that one. China is a socialist dictatorial country, and they would never allow the real numbers to come out! Moreover the Chinese police don't even respond to 90 percent of calls. You can easily kill somebody in China and the police wouldn't care. My wifes' body is filled with scars from muslim gangs in China torturing her, beating her, cutting her with barber knifes etc. For 10 years they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from her businesses, controlled her life, and in spite of calling the police thousands of times, hireling lawyers, contacting global domestic abuse organizations, <b> nobody </b>ever did anything. The few times the police would show, they would say \"it's not my job\". And one of these qycorpaths even used to live in the US as an illegal<b>  alien</b>. He killed a man and in turkey then fled to the US. He lived here for 20 years and wasn't deported until he beat up a<b> n elderl</b>y lady. This guy is still living in China, and the only reason my wife's life is not controlled by these muslims anymore, is because I helped her escape from China, to a country where she now has the right to protect herself. This clearly shows as well, how flawed the US immigrations system is, and how weak our borders are.\nDon't you find it wired that when looking at a map of Murder rates, even some ISIS controlled countries and countries at war have low murder rates? You obviously can't trust stats out of 2nd and 3rd world countries! Every time mass murders happen in China, the government sweeps the area. They then go door to door, and threaten people with prison time if they report it, or tell anyone about it. Remember I lived and worked in China and my wife is Chinese! Little children are killed by the hundreds of millions by the government or abducted and sold <b> as s</b>ex slaves, or sold to pharmasutical organizations and hospitals where they are slaughtered and their vital organs sold to the highest bidder. In fact my wife, have lost several friends because of this and she has friends that have lost children and loved ones to it. I could never imagine what the total annual death toll would be, if all the numbers of dead could be compiled. Unfortunately anybody trying to do research on this in China are usually found in a dumpster the next day, killed by the government. \n\n\"I only said this because every time that I ask a Chinese about this they said that they feel safer in China\" - Chinese always tend to love their country. But then you start hearing about how many of their friends of family have been abducted or killed and you realize something is wrong! Chinese are absolutely brainwashed in Schools! They are taught to love Mao, and even foreign dictators. The biggest idol of one of my wifes' friends is Stalin! By the way, don't buy Huaway phones! The Chinese government requires from the company to put surveillance chips in their phones and that includes the ones being sold in the US! The Chinese are watching the Americans.",

You have to use statistics.  I looked at the numbers of murders per 100 000 people in the last years in US and also in 2000.  Only 7 states had less than 2 murders per 100 000 people.  I did the same in the EU and couldn't find any country with more than 2 murders per 100 000. In fact , UK and France who have garnered the media attention for very unsafe places in EU have 1.2 murders. Also if you go beyond Europe, to Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand etc, all those countries are safer than US. \nAlso, states like Vermont or Oregon that are very safe are not conservatives.

                    "commentText": "@rey \u200b- Hey Rey. I've studied these stats a big part of my life! \n\n\"I did the same in the EU and couldn't find any country with more than 2 murders per 100 000. In fact , UK and France who have garnered the media attention for very unsafe places in EU have 1.2 murders.\" - Well then you certainly didn't look carefully, because the murder rate for the European Union alone is 2.69, and if you included all of Europe including the high crime countries, the number would be much higher! Ukraine was rated at 6.34 in 2014,  Montenegro, was rated at 4.46 in 2016,  Latvia rated at 3.36 in 2015, Lithuania rated at 6.00 in 2015,  Belarus rated at 3.58 in 2014 etc. not to mention European Russia, rated at 11.30 in 2015, which occupies almost 40% of Europe's total area. And the European portion of Turkey known as Thrace, and turkey overall being rated at 4.31 in 2014. France and the UK are not considered some of the most dangerous places in Europe at all, but London and Paris have very high murder rates! Both the UK and France have some of the lower murder rates in Europe. \n\n [LINK] \n\n [LINK] \n\n [LINK] \n\nThe United States, with an average murder rate of approximately 5 per 100,000 is compared to a variety of Western and Central European countries (also sometimes Japan) with murder rates often below 1 per 100,000. This is, in turn, supposed to fill Americans with a sense of shame and illustrate that the United States should be regarded as some sort of pariah <b> nation </b>because of its murder rate.\n\nNote, however, that these comparisons always employ a carefully selected list of countries, most of which are very unlike the United States. They are countries that were settled long ago by the dominant<b>  ethnic</b> group, they are ethnically non-diverse today, they are frequently very small countries (such as Norway, with a population of 5 million) with very locally based democracies (again, unlike the US with an immense population and far fewer representatives in government per voter). Politically, historically, and demographically, the US has little i<b> n commo</b>n with Europe or Japan. And also remember, the vast majority of murders in the US come from very specific states! There where around 15.140 murders in the US in 2015. 1,861 where killed in California, 1,276 where killed in Texas, 1,149 where killed in Florida, 651 where killed in Pennsylvania, 611 where killed in New York state and 571 where killed in Michigan (Notice how 4 out of 6 of those states are also among the most left leaning states). Combined that's 6,119, meaning 40.41% or almost half of all combine murders in the US, comes from 5 states out of 50 US states!  \n\n [LINK] \n\n [LINK] \n\n\"Also, states like Vermont or Oregon that are very safe are not conservatives. These states are very liberals. The fact that the number of guns is high doesn't imply that are conservatives.\" - You do know that there is a big difference between liberal, leftist and democrat right. Most true liberals actually tend to be pro gun. Oregon is indeed a majority left voting state, but murder rates in Oregon range between 2-4. Not high, but not among the lowest either. Vermont (Murder rate between 1-2) is more or less a swing state I guess. They voted for Hilary in 2016, but Phil Scott won by more than 55% in the midterms, and all but one county (Windham County), vot<b> ed <b> r</b</b>>ed with some counties reaching 70% republican votes. \n\n\"My only point is that crime is not related to be conservative. Do you consider Texas, Louisiana and the state in the south be conservatives? Because in my definition they are. They are religious, very republicans in the sense of no taxes , for the 2nd amendment etc.\" - They are definitely majority conservative. But all southern states have high crime rates because they are right on the border where more than half million illegal immigrants pour across annually, and more than 90 percent of all drugs are estimated to be coming from the souther border. And according to the Texas department of safety, between 2011 and 2018 more than 663.000 crimes where committed by illegal immigrants. And according to DHS status indicators, over 270,000 criminal aliens have been booked into local Texas jails between June 1, 2011 and October 31, 2018, of which over 182,000 were classified as illegal aliens by DHS, so it's clear that it's not your average Texas farmer committing the crimes and murders.\n\n [LINK] \n\nI'm talking in general terms! Look at it this way, on the flip side if you will. There is not, and there has never been one single conservative or capitalist country in the world that has or has ever been a dictatorship. All dictatorial countries are far left Socialist <b> and \"Commu</b>nist\" countries, using big government to control the populous, and impose social justice laws. \n\n\"Also if you go beyond Europe, to Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand etc, all those countries are safer than US.\" - Now if we talk about general safety, that is far from the truth! \nAs an example, general mortality rate is quite a bit higher in the UK, Lithuania, Ukraine, Italy, Poland, Sweden etc. and most EU countries as a matter of fact compared to the US, which clearly shows on the map, which link for I've added below .\n\nDeath rate= Average annual number of deaths during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate.\n\nUNITED STATES         Between 7-8         (2006) EST.\nEUROPE                       Between 9-10       (2006) EST.\n\nSource:   [LINK]  \n\nUpdated CIA stats from 2017 show equal results where most EU countries rank between 9.20 to 14.60. JAPAN was rated at 9.80, and CANADA at 8.70. A Lot higher than the US rated at 8.20! AUSTRALIA though, was rated lower at 7.30, and that goes for NEW ZEALAND as well, rated at 7.50.\nCrude death rate stats for individual US states do not exist, but remember, if we could dig into the stats for individual US states, we would obviously find much better numbers for some states, but also worse numbers for other states!\n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nCRUDE DEATH RATE! That means it includes all causes of death. Including all kinds of homicide, car deaths, deaths th<b> rough al</b>cohol, c<b> ance</b<b> >r, </b>old age, Infant Mortality Rate, Neonatal Mortality Rate etc. etc. etc.\n\nAnd the notion many people make, that Europe in general is safer than t<b> he US is</b> nothing but silly! How many world wars came out of the US? Non where even started by 2nd or 3rd world countries, they both came out of EU. How many Berlin walls have been build in the US? And how many times have the US had dictators or dictatorship? NON! EU has had more dictatorships in the last century than I can count, and many of them I've never even heard of! \n\nAnt\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar in Portugal\nMikl\u00f3s Horthy de Nagyb\u00e1nya in Hungary, \nIoannis Metaxas in Greece, \nColonel Georgios Papadopoulos in Greece \nIon Victor Antonescu in Romania\nTodor Hristov Zhivkov People's Republic of Bulgaria\nAnte Paveli\u0107 fascist leader in Croatia\nWojciech Witold Jaruzelski in Poland  \nNicolae Ceau\u0219escu in Romania\nFrancisco Franco Bahamonde in Spain\nBenito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini in Italy\nAdolf Hitler in German\nHristov Zhivkov in Bulgaria\netc.\n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nAnd as late as yesterday, it seems Ukraine and Russia is on the brink of war ONCE AGAIN, opening fire at each other. And looking at a map, it's vividly clear Europe has more bombings, shootings and terror attacks in general. In fact if you compare 2015 and 2016 to the US, EU doesn't even look that much different from the Middle East.\n\nSource:  [LINK] ",

I do however have a degree in comparative religion, and the practicing Muslim person who is devoted enough to wear a hijab will not be a fair an impartial person in a position of authority, their creed demands anti-Semitic intolerance, they believe their father Abraham passed over the rightful heir of Ishmael (son with a slave)  for Isaac (son with his wife) also Muhammad was shunned by the Jews with his prophetic writings so he stared Islam. These are all well documented facts. If you do not convert to Islam you are thought of as an infidel. Again these are facts. I have no horse in the <b> race </b>or skin in the game I do not subscribe to any major religious sect. Devout Muslims do not want to do anything but conquer and convert.

Paganism is reverence to the natural world and the spirits therein. The Abrahamic faiths are the barbarous ones.

Of course monotheism was only invented to enslave the masses by cutting them off from the natural world and the power that such a communion brings by labeling it as \"evil\" or \"barbaric\". In truth the leaders of the big three all practice th<b> e ol</b>d ways in secret. Only the enslaved worship the false yahweh that was invented by LHP magicians to horde all of the magic for themselves.\n\nOf course I don't expect you to accept the truth. You will laugh it off.

If that were truly the case, I think billions of Muslims and myself included would be committing a sin. This very specific verse refers to a time of the Prophet when the 'Jews and Christians were in open conflict with the Muslims, there were some Muslims who were more concerned about maintaining there alliances with the Jews and Christians at the expense of the Muslim community. The above verse is referring to such situations where Muslims with doubts in their hearts will ally themselves with the enemy.' So this does not apply to modern day society. Once again I have Jewish and Christian friends and I attend many interfaith events. I can assure you once again this is not about religion.",

However, thats simply not fair for me take those verses out of context and use them in arguments or debates. Many of these verses are not taken literally and rightfully so. Here's an example; 1 Samuel 15:3: \"This is what the Lord Almighty says ... 'Now go and strike Amalek and devote to destruction all that they have. Do not spare them, but kill both man and <b> woman,</b> child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.' \" Now an uneducated person may be taken back by this but as my world religions professor taught us, you can't just look at a couple of verses and claim to know and understand an entire religion.",

Why is it when we are against Israel it's anti-Semitic, but when you're against Iran it's not anti-Persian? I love the Jewish people including the Jewish diaspora, but Israel has gone too far lately and their disregard for human rights is leading to further instability in the Middle East. It's not the Jewish people it's the Israeli government. Israel needs new leaders who will treat Palestinians like human beings and allow them to form their own state.",

On the other hand you have the Saudis who work with the Republicans. Reason: Saudis have the biggest oil reserves in the world. The Arab world thinks that their oil should be shared by all Arabs not just the Saudis. They have always wanted Saudi oil starting with Gamel nasser in Egypt. As a result they sided with the Americans for support and the Republicans support Israel. So the Saudis support Israel too. Nasser and Egypt sided with the Soviet Union. Both of them use Palestine to legitimize their hold on power and gain traction. The Muslim brotherhood has always strived to be a legitimate power in the Middle East. They have bought out governments by milking the Palestinian issue which they never want solved.  With the Arab spring in 2011 and the brotherhood gaining political power, relations soured with Saudi Arabia and went downhill from there. It is clear now that the Democrats do not support Israel and want it wiped out to gain Islamic support for their vote bank politics . They know that Muslims will be the next big wave of immigrants so sucking up to the brotherhood and their causes will give them the next big voting base.at the end of the day it's all about money and power.",

Hmmm.  \n\n1) JESUS was born to a Jewish <b> woman\n</b>2)  The Disciples were Jews\n3) The founders of the faith were originally JEWS.\n4) GOD says he will bless those that bless them and curse those that curse them.  So far thoughout history that ends up being true.  Sometimes it takes longer than other times though\n\n5) In the last days GOD eventually protects the Jews which will be living in Israel.\n\n6) The Jews have contributed a disproportionate amount of advancements in every field.\n\nThere are so many reasons for people to like Jews.  Do your research.  All the people that cozy up those that hate Jews are liberals. Conservative Christians believe GOD has a plan for Israel, and loves them.  Although there is a minority that believe in replacement theology.",

You idiot buffoon from which you get your ignorant propaganda (Revelations 3:9).\n\n  The \"history\" of and the seven \"eras\" of the true Church of Jesus The Christ from the time of Acts 2:1 until the end of days is prophesied in Revelations chapters one through three (Rev 1:4)!  To the \"Churches\".   Which are the followers of Jesus The Christ.  The people that accept Jesus as the Savor doing the Work of The Heavenly Holy Father\n\n  Those of the Judaism (Jews) are people that look forward to a Savor but don't and haven't accepted Jesus as The One they wait for, even till this day!\n\nSo you idiot!  Revelations 3:9 is about followers of Jesus The Christ,  of His \"Church\" that once knew the truth but then turned away, apostates, and have returned to the world rejecting the Sabbath keeping as commanded (Exodus 31:13, 17).  It was Roman pagan Catholicism that enforced \"sun\" day worship (Daniel 7:25).  And prosecuted followers of Christ continuing the Sabbath Observances.  Catholicism titled them Judaziers!  Or Jews!\n\n  Satan's synagogue is everyone that is not of The Church of Jesus The Christ (Ephesians 2:2;  2 Corinthians 4:4).  The word synagogue # 4864 means assembly, congregation, church.\n\nGod said to live literally by every Word of The Lord (Matthew 4:4; Deut 8:3).  And you are truly mislead by your ignorance of just one word \"synagogue\".\n\nBTW you idiot.  Roman Catholicism spread their ideology by the physical sword.  They did not spread the ideology of Jesus The Christ!",

                    "commentText": "@Shane Webber  I'm Minnesotan. I worked in Minneapolis when the Somali migration began in the late 80s. I didn't find out what was happening to Minnesota until 2010, and I was routinely watching evening broadcast news, CNN and reading the Star Tribune. Now I don't use any of those news sources since I began receiving news about Minnesota from OUTSIDE Minnesota. We have been betrayed by Governor Mark Dayton who was voted in because of name recognition. He is nearly a falling down drunk now heavily medicated with psychotropics, as best I can tell from watching videos of him speaking to groups of Somalis. The broadcast media celebrated him, same with the newspaper. The news used to be fairly trustworthy back in the 80s and prior but the Star Tribune has become a rag with a nearly illiterate editor. Most articles have a byline that is a name that suggests their English is a second language. Minnesotans nearly gave Trump a win on Minnesota. Shane,  I need to modify your comment that \"Minnesota\" doesn't care about its small town working class and farmers. Minnesotans have had their \"Minnesota Nice\" used against them by the <b> Refugee </b>Resettlement Industry and Minnesota Senators with their eyes focused on the economy. Now I live near the other large population of Somalis in Minnesota . . in Central Minnesota . . and I'm seeing evidence that the Somali males and illegal Mexicans are working in slaughterhouses. Looks like some Minnesota farmers are linked to the use of labor from poor countries. I really hate being around the Somali guys who can be so easily radicalized. The mall a mile from me experienced a stabbing assault on 10 shoppers by a Somali male who was described as one of the most assimilated! He was shot dead by an off duty cop on 9.17.16. I anticipate another outburst like that anytime now. But this influx is not the fault of ordinary Minnesotans. They have been duped and are waking.",

                    "commentText": "The problem is that members of free societies are ill-prepared to accept that an ideology such as Islam requires the calculation of their destruction even BEFORE Muslim believers begin to arrive onto their territories. Jihad does NOT begin with the beheading of Christians. \r\rThe first, and perhaps the most important phase of jihad, is to compel masses of believers to infiltrate a host <b> nation.</b> Even if their numbers are not initially large compared to the number of secular citizens already living in that society the odds are immediately stacked against the survival of the host culture for the primary reason that civilized societies are always monogamous. Islam, however, encourages every male to have up to 4 wives and an unlimited brood with each. (Not too different from latino populations which are monogamous only \u2018in theory'.) \r\r\n\nWithin a generation or two the indigenous population of the host<b>  nation</b> is dangerously out-populated by masses of people who drop the overall IQ level of tha<b> t natio</b>n by considerable points. These are easily controlled, greedy masses that use their newly acquired, unearned 'rights' to compel a rapid political and cultural implosion of their host nations. Only when the demographic situation is sufficiently ripe does the second, more brutal phase of jihad begin. \n\n\r\rIt is critical to remember that the objective of EVERY practicing Islamist is JIHAD. The 'peaceful' Muslim believer signs onto phase one of the process, to systematically parasitize and 'seduce' a culture, while the radical believer follows up with the all-out frontal attack of phase two. Those who take on the role of the first phase pretend to be 'offended' when one points out the<b> ir imperiali</b>st intentions while the second phasers delight in the shocked expression on the faces of the victims they are about to sacrifice. Both groups are culpable. Both are equally dangerous to everything our forefathers fought, bled and died to provide us. \r\r\n\nBrigette Gabriel describes the takeover of (Christian) Lebanon:  [LINK]  \r\r\n\nTrue Islam (by William Federer)\r [LINK] \n\n\r\r(To every muslim who wants to do the 'right thing': It is your responsibility to read <b> the Qu</b>ran, Hadith and Sirra COVER TO COVER, in a language you understand and then to take full PERSONAL responsibility for your choice to serve your 'god' as well as for YOUR PARTICIPATION in the call to destroy the creations that better men have built. For those who wish to leave Islam, there are wonderful people willing to sacrifice their lives to save you. Just please stop defending your faith from a place of ignorance and li<b> ttle b</b>lack lies.) \n\n\r\rI INVITE ALL OF YOU TO VISIT WISDOMABOVEGOLD.COM FOR INFORMATION YOU MUST HAVE. ANYONE WILLING TO COPY AND PASTE THE ABOVE TEXT TO SPREAD THE WORD MAY DO SO FREELY. \r                          ________________________________\r\r\r\nCompare the goal of YHWH to liberate humanity from the state of karmic quarantine in which we live to Allah's objective which is to subjugate all of humanity to the lowest level of our game box prison metaphorically represented in Islam as the Kaaba <b> (the '</b>Black' Cube). It is the most despicable of lies to suggest that these diametrically opposed missions are equitable on any level. One came to set men free, the other to spring the final Satanic clampdown on all human expression and to relegate humankind to its fullest & final entropic bondage. When Christ requires submission it is of the sort required by any commander-in-chief attempting to complete a worthy mission while at the same time getting as many of his people out alive as is possible. The brand of submission required by Allah serves only to demean, suffocate and wither all creative human expression. \r\r\n\nChrist's words: \rThe thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: \rI am come that they might have life, \rand that they might have it more abundantly. \rJohn 10:10 \n\r\rALLAH=SUBMISSION \n\rYESHUA=SALVATION",

                    "commentText": "@Owlblocks David You make my point for me, my good man. Muslims take Islam seriously, and in a great many cases quite literally. If Muslims as a whole disregarded the evil bits of Islam and focused on the few good bits, there would be no problem. Unfortunately, we all know that is not the case. If we had Christians and Jews running around calling for the slaughter of those they consider unbelievers and impure, we would be fighting Christians and Jews the same way we fight Muslims.\n\nMy other point, my main one I think, is that Islam is inherently antisemitic. The reason for that is as I already mentioned: Muhammad hated the Jews, mainly because they rejected him. He found reasons to expel them from their homes and massacre them. The point cannot be understated. All the Abrahamic religions are evil, man made systems of control. Judaism begot Christianity, and together they gave us Islam. Islam just happens to espouse a great deal more violence and repression than the other two. Islam is also explicit in its hatred of the Jews. Read the Qur'an, and read the biography of Muhammad. Even the most sympathetic writers do not shy away from the fact that Muhammad hated the Jews for one reason or another.",

I don't understand how all of you can ignore the very words of the Messiah himself, when he said to the Jews your temple lies desolate. When he said to the Jews that the message will go out to another people. And I can give you about another dozen off the top of my head up quotes from God himself about Israel and why the scepter will be given to another people because of their disobedience. You do realize that the Messiah of Israel is Jesus Christ, right? You do realize that those Jews murdered Jesus Christ? That's hardly a people who we're following the Messiah. They still can't get it through their thick heads that the Messiah and Jesus Christ are one and the same. Daniel 9:24- 27 makes it clear that Israel had a 490 year probation and if they did not come to the accepting of the truth and following God that the message would go out to another people. That the message would go out to the Gentiles. Those Gentiles are called the Christian church. What do you think Paul and Peter were? They were Christian. There's not two messages. Christ is not double-minded. The message went out in ad 34 to the Christian church. Israel is the Christian church or I should say the true Christian Church. That state of Israel is <b> nothing </b>but a political Pawn of the Roman Catholic Church which is the Antichrist, and apostate protestantism,Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism are her daughters.",

Brother or Sister, everything you see going on around you is <b> nothing </b>but one big huge drama being played out on the Earth. All of the politicians are the actors and we are the spectators. The Democrats and the Republicans are just following orders from the Jesuits. Donald Trump is just trying to destroy that Johnson Act so that they can mix church and state. Getting rid of abortion is a good thing. Overturning the ability for homosexuals to get married is a good thing. Bringing prayer back into public schools is a good thing. But it will not end there and that is the problem. They will continue to combine church and state until what we have is a repeat of what happened during the Dark Ages. Human nature will be human nature period over 50 million people were murdered because they wanted to know the truth about God period between Islam and Roman Catholicism that's how many people were murdered during the Dark Ages. That's why there was a Protestant Reformation. That's why the United States was settled by Christian running away from the persecution in Europe. The whole purpose of the United States was to get away from church and state relationship that Rome had with the European nations. So what? We're going to just go ahead and repeat that? Yes, that's what the Bible says is going to happen. So I realized that many of the things Trump is doing sounds good, but in reality him in the Democrats are working for the same people. The Democrats want to bring in a bunch of regulations because of it what they consider is climate change. This will also bring in a church-state relationship because the Roman Catholic Church and toast is backing climate change and so they therefore agree with the Democrats. So we have the room in church agreeing with Trump on some things, and then agreeing with the Democrats on other things. That's because they're running both parties. They only thing a Christian can do is listen to The Bible and follow God, because getting into the political Realm as a Christian is dangerous business.",

There is no such thing as a 7 year tribulation and you cannot show it to me in the Bible. You're taking the last 7 years of a 490 year prophecy in Daniel 9 and taking that last 7 years and putting it at the end of the world. That prophecy was about Israel and it was their probationary time that they had left to come and accept the Messiah. They did not do so. So the message went out to another group. Do you not believe the words of the person you claim to worship when he told Israel that the message would go to another people? You better get out of Babylon before the second coming or you'll die at his brightness. Because if you're waiting to be taken away you're going to be waiting a long time because there is no such thing as a secret rapture. You cannot show it to me in the Bible and I know every verse that you're going to try to show me and it does not talk about a secret rapture. I can give you multiple reasons why there is no secret rapture, using the Bible. When Jesus comes the second time every person on this planet will know it because it will be loud and bright and the atmosphere will be removed from this planet and the Son of God will be in full View of everyone. The Jews are not going to get any special probation. They're probation ended in ad 34. They can be saved as individuals if they accept that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and have the faith of Jesus and keep his Commandments. I will give you a website if you are willing to look at it. The most dangerous Christian to be as one with a closed mind and is not willing to learn. They are the ones that will say Lord Lord all this I have done in your name and Jesus will say to them get away from me I do not know you Wicked Man. Don't be that man. remnantofgod.org",

I've been studying the Bible for 40 years and I've never seen any place that said that all men are going to be saved. That is called universalism and come straight from the pit of Hell known as the Jesuits. Brother, if you don't die daily to sin, just like Paul had to, then you can be lost. There is <b> nothing </b>in the Bible that teaches once saved always saved, and in fact it teaches just the opposite. Jesus said narrow is the way that leads to heaven and wide is the road to destruction. there is no sin in heaven or on the new Earth, so you must prepare yourself now to live without sin in heaven and on the new Earth. If we could all just send and go to heaven then there would have been no point for God to kick Lucifer Out of Heaven, and no need for Jesus Christ to die on the cross. Both of those things would have been unnecessary if we could just sin and still go to heaven. remnantofgod.org",

What you fail to understand is that in the Bible it says that a thousand years to the Lord is like a day to mankind. God is Not on our time, we are on his time. So what has been 2,000 years to you has been like 2 days to God. You're talking about a being that has been around for Infinity. We've been on this planet for 6000 years, which is like 6 days to God. The ignorance of mankind is amazing. For thousands of years mankind has believed in God, and they got that belief from evidence from their ancestors. They believed their ancestors were telling them the truth, because people didn't lie like they do today, and they had sympathy for other human beings. Then along comes this little ignorant man named Darwin in the last 170 years, and half of the planet Falls right for his nonsense. Absolutely no evidence whatsoever of darwinian evolution. Every time someone argues this point with me they're never able to actually show me any transitional species. They try to point out Lucy or the Peking man which have both been proven to be faked, but they can never show me anything else. We're not looking for a couple of transitional species here, for evolution to be true there has to be billions of them. Multiple stages of each species on the planet including humans. And after a hundred and sixty years of digging they have found squat basically. So don't feel sorry for me feel sorry for yourself for believing such foolishness. I don't care if you have a trillion hundred quadrillion years, you're never going to make something as complicated as a cell without some form of intelligence working with evolution. Time is never going to produce a species of anything. It always gets me that people like you will laugh at me for believing in God, but don't laugh at yourself for believing that the whole world came from a pencil point that exploded informed everything we see today? Seriously? You're more intelligent than that I'm sure. Seek and you shall find the truth. I have a dozen people I know personally that were once atheist, and now believe in God. Because what's the actually started looking at the evidence, it became very apparent to them that Evolution was just not viable, and if that is true that there must be a creator of this universe.\n       Hopefully you'll wake to the truth, or you'll wake up with plague on your face, your choice!\n           You do know that they have found the original burial sites for Joseph and hieroglyphics describing a 7-year famine and a leader who saved Egypt from starvation, right? I guess you don't know that they have found evidence of mass burials dated back to the time when there was a major kill off from plagues in? There is so much archaeological evidence that has been found around the Middle East and Egypt that does not make the Daily News because they don't want people to know the truth. They say ignorance is bliss.",

What is it about Jesus saying that the scepter is going to be removed and given to another people, that you guys can't understand? The Jews rejected and killed the Messiah! The New Testament makes it very clear. Jesus says that your temple lies desolate. When they killed Jesus the temple curtain ripped by unseen hands exposing the most holy. This means that it's no longer a Most Holy and it was just a building. The true Christian Church is the Israel of the Bible. For 2,000 years from Adam until Abraham God had a people. From Abraham until Jesus was 2000 years and God have the people known as the Hebrews. From Jesus until our time is almost 2000 years and God has a people and they're called the true Christian Church. The Jews had their time and now the message has gone out to a different people. Study to show thyself approved or be deceived by satanic forces. Peace. remnantofgod.org",

                    "commentText": "@O'Rileyfrom Cork brother, there are actually three comings of Jesus Christ. The first was obviously when the Son of God was born in a manger being fully God, but also fully human. The second coming of Christ is about to be fulfilled when the Lord Jesus comes in the atmosphere and reawakens those who are sleeping in the grave and are saved. Jesus Christ will not touch the Earth at his second coming. This is extremely important to understand because Satan is going to counterfeit the second coming of Jesus Christ. But he will not be allowed to fully duplicate it. This basically means that Satan will be walking around claiming to be God and performing miracles. These will not be some type of magician tricks, but actually supernatural miracles which will deceive most of those on Earth, especially the atheists. That is why the Bible says if they say that Jesus is in the mountains or in the desert go not out to see him because it will not be Jesus Christ. Jesus will not touch the Earth at his second coming. Jesus does touch the Earth at his third coming. The Bible says that he touches the Mount of Olives and it Cleaves to form a huge plain big enough to allow the city of Jerusalem to land in that area. When Jesus touches the Earth he purifies that section of the Earth so that the purified city of New Jerusalem will not be soiled by the sin and filth of this Earth. This third coming does not happen until the Millennium is over. So between the second coming of Jesus and the third coming of Jesus is period known as the millennium. So it would be impossible for you to wait for Jesus to come to that spot because if you're not in the city coming down with Jesus in the first place then you did not make it in the first resurrection at the second coming. At the second coming there are four groups of people. Those who are alive and saved. Those who are alive and wicked and lost. Those who are dead and saved. And those who are dead and lost. When Jesus enters the atmosphere of the Earth the dead in Christ will rise first to receive their new bodies and go to heaven for a thousand years. The wicked dead will remain in their graves for that Thousand Years. The wicked living will be killed by the brightness of Jesus Christ and they will try to run for the caves in the mountains but they will not Escape. They will lie when the earth dead for the beginning of that Thousand Years. The living saved will then rise up to Jesus after the others and receive their new bodies. Then they will all go to heaven for 1000 years. After A Thousand Years the city of New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven with the redeemed in it and land on a purified Mount Olive that has turned into a large plain. At this time Jesus will rise above the city of New Jerusalem and Shout to the Dead and they will arise out of their graves and also of the Earth where they laid. Satan and his Fallen Angels who have been on this Earth without anyone to tempt for 1000 years will now go around to these billions of people to tempt them to attack the city and take it from Jesus. We do not know how long this period will be but I imagine it will take a couple months or more because the Earth is totally destroyed at the second coming and they will try to attack the city with weapons. So they will have to make those weapons somehow. You will have some of the greatest generals and wicked men that the world has ever seen in one large army. As they approach the city of New Jerusalem the father will rain fire and brimstone Out of Heaven and the wicked will burn to ashes in front of the redeemed. They will be gone forever. They will be dead forever and the redeemed will be alive forever. Then Jesus will walk out of the city of New Jerusalem and will recreate the entire Earth in front of the redeemed human <b> race.</b> There will be no more sin and our planet will once more rejoin the universe of people who live without sin. Peace and blessings to your family. remnantofgod.org",

Frankly with the way the situation is in the world today, I really don't expect Jesus to arrive much more than a couple years from now. I'm not predicting that, I'm just telling you that from all the signs that I see it can't be far off. I mean New York state is now murdering infants after they come out of the womb at 9 months. You can't get much more demon-possessed than that.",

                    "commentText": "That's just a secular state it has <b> nothing </b>to do with Jesus Christ. Most of the people over there aren't even real Jews. Israel is controlled by the Pope and they should not even have that land. That land was guaranteed to the original Hebrews as long as they remain faithful to God. They ceased to remain faithful to God on numerous occasions, including being so rebellious that they started worshipping Baal. It got so bad that God allow the Babylonians to capture Jerusalem and take them into captivity for 70 years. But they did not learn their lesson and after captivity under the Greeks and the Romans they basically cease to be God's people any longer, culminating in the murder of the son of God. White Jesus said to them your house is left unto you desolate. After the murder of Stephen in a d-34 they cease to be God's people any longer. They can be saved as individuals if they accept Jesus Christ, but the message has gone out to the Christian church and that is your modern day Israel. I cannot understand how anyone can read the Bible and not come to this understanding. They let a thief and murderer go in order to murder their own Messiah. There is no separation between the Jew and Greek. That cannot be any clearer in the Bible. Search for a Christian Church it keeps the Ten Commandments and has righteousness by faith and you will find the biblical Israel of today. remnantofgod.org",

Original Christians spoke Aramaic then Latin but because English became the language of commerce and was easier to learn and speak, it became the <b> common </b>language and Latin 'died.' Not all Islamic countries speak Arabic but they are still Muslim.\nHere is a quick History lesson for you...Christopher Columbus never set foot on the North American Continent so he has<b>  nothing</b> to do with the Thanksgiving holiday. It was John Smith, William Bradford and the Pilgrims. \nAlso, there are several historical versions concerning Columbus's activities relating to the Caribbean and Central American natives so the link you attached is not confirmation of anything. I will also repeat myself since reading comprehension is not one of your strengths. Yes, early Christians mistreated people, especially Native Americans in early Christian Schools but those practices ended over a century ago. Pedophilia, Female Genital Mutilation, Honor Killings, Forced Conversion, Beheadings, Rape, Terrorism, Slavery<b> , Se</b>x Trafficing Etc. In the name of allah still exist and are alive and well in most, if not all, Islamic countries or where there are large Muslim populations (even illegally in the U.S.). Christians do not condone or will accept that type of barbaric, animalistic behavior. You cannot defend the indefensible.",

Dershowitz is misinforming you about the immensely complicated situation in Isreal and its bordering neighbors. Quite frankly this is just another concocted anti-liberal story that feed it's viewer's irrational obsession. I noticed very little was mentioned about the far-right neonazis or that other piece of shit white nationalists that shot up the synagogue in Pittsburgh. This video is insulting to the American people's intelligence for its obvious propaganda and exploitation of Jewish people. Condemning The State of Israel for their atrocities against the Palestinians is not at all anti-Semitic. I am disappointed with the average American citizen who sides with the Republican Party based on just a few issues that appeals to them. The conservative elitist politicians play their base like a violin by endorsing mostly irrelevant or isolated minor issues that ignorant people are passionate about.",

Basically it's the same as the northern Irish fighting the British over religious differences but instead of being different sects of christianity it's different sects of Islam. Shia killing Sunni and vice versa. \nThe Arabs have been killing Jews for centuries. The British had to send in the troops in 1928 to stop a Jewish massacre in Hebron. So the lie that there was peace is not true. \nThe Gaza strip was returned and what did Hamas do? They turned it into a military base and rocket launching platform to hit the civilian population of Tel Aviv. \nI bet you also didnt realize that the Palestinian government is also Socialist.",

In socialist countries like you like to call them (I assume you mean the social democrat counties, like EVERY OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD (?)) they have health care for everybody, no rejections, programs etc. Or do you think it is just by chance that Americans live so much shorter than e.g. Japanese (around 8-9 years), Spaniards (around 7-8 years) and all other decent countries with health care for all (around 3 years living longer on average)? And of course their systems are around 40% CHEAPER on average, as they are not being robbed by pharma and businesses. I get it that you want a system, which is far and far more expensive and is far worse, but what than not let others enjoy a better and far cheaper system, and you just donate the 40% additional to government?

Or does your grandmother, which might get a very urgent problem start to visit different hospitals, making a in depth analyses of the offers and qualities? Of course not: she rushes out to hospital and has to be helped. The ideal way to abuse. And NO competition, or do you want 4 or 5 hospitals in every village \"competing with each other\"? It is all VERY SIMPLE (as ALL decent and developed countries, accept 1=USA, DO IT already): analyse the existing alternatives (price, quality, competitiveness) and choose and implement. What is sure: the US system is NOT cost efficient, does NOT offer high quality, is NOT helping everyone, so...total disaster of the so called \"free market\" (there is NO economist anymore to be found (accept those sponsored by e.g. the Koch brothers, or republican manipulation biased \"think thanks\"), which supports the concept of free market to these kind of markets.

Why not repeal the Nixon era HMO act? \nWhy do politicians not bring this up? It's about money and power. Socialism may seem great for its benefits, yet what rights must you give up? What level of tax must you pay? None of the 1st world nations are socialist with the exception of China and I wouldn't recommend that Orwellian police state for anyone.",

If you can afford you go the best (e.g. Harvard for education), but it is all about \"the people\" (and only about \"the rich\"), so \"the average\" and that is, both for health care AND education BAD. People live FAR SHORTER LIVES IN THE USA. The system does NOT perform optimally. Of course some people fly into the USA to get the best treatment in the world. That makes the story even worse, as these extreme good hospitals are also in the statistics, which means that other hospitals are, on average, even worse. You are very very bad informed about ALL other countries. Again, there is NO country in the world, developed, with does not offer health care for all. NONE, accept the USA. Please do visit these countries, like Australia, Japan, Chili, Finland, Netherlands, Spain (which until not too long ago had even the best system), South Korea etc. etc. etc.. Hope you have been there and watched reality, as you seem to get your information from Elvis? Assist suicide due to cost savings? What a total nonsense and a disgraceful insult to very human systems for <b> old </b>people, who CHOOSE to do so. Perhaps you hate freedom, but IF somebody, after many and many years of intensive consideration and guidance, decides that life is finished, due to unbearable suffering, than a process is being started, including  several<b>  doctors</b> (and NO doctor is related to \"cost savings systems\", you might be confused with our bonus based drug prescribin<b> g doctor</b>s: that does NOT exist in the real world outside the USA?) than that can be done, and will be tested by the legal system IF ever any doubts, but as you know e.g. in the Netherlands there has only been one case of doubt, and that was studied for years, and at the end they found it was baseless. I understand you like people to suffer, and I really hope it never happens with you and your parents, as it is terrible. My mother had it, but did not opt for euthanasia, as her religion forbid her to.

Languages are just a hobby, so learned 17, but only speak 9. Worked in 8 countries, and visited more than 90 (adding 3 new ones this year, Moldova (just returned), Estland (last month) and the Philippines (coming two months). Some of my friends did Harvard by the way, others INSEAD, MID, Bocconi and Tokyo U. That for no higher degree, but glad to learn every day! Yes...Stalinism etc. is bad. And NO Venezuela is not a democratic socialist state, but a dictatorship (calling the press the enemy of the people, having extreme inequality (even higher than the USA!), and the main disaster of course coming from the Spain first policies of nationalistic Spain in the 16th century).  \n\"If you can not pay it is free\". Well well...yes, but...please look at who goes there and who does NOT go there, or do you really think that a bright person from the outskirts ends up in Harvard? Very very rarely, as life will not give this person a decent chance (which costs the USA by the way trillions of economic contribution...as you know 1 dollar invested in education (especially for the poor) brings in up to 4 dollars, while the same money wasted on tax cuts for the rich hardly brings anything, all this is widely agreed on among economists and extensively published). So...NO the \"normal guy\" with the same capacities will never beat the rich one. Why do you think a person like trump or Bush made it to good school, as they obviously lack the capacity as compared to so many tens so thousands of other capably (poor) kids. \nTax rates are highest in the most happy countries, as you know (also extensively researched and yearly published rankings). Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Netherlands, Australia all have very high tax rates, and extreme good and broad public services and infrastructures, with the only exception being New Zealand, which is able to combine extreme and broad public services, with relatively low taxes (around USA level, but the USA does NOT offer the same to its population). \nCorporate tax cuts in countries like Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Finland are high, as no idiot would leave these countries \"for lower taxes\". It is a very strange idea and mentality that people do everything for money, let alone some pennies more, if they are already well to do. As you know scientific studies have proven time and again that happiness hardly increases after an income of around USD 70.000 (of course depending where you live in the USA, NY etc. will not do). Social cohesion, safety, feeling of belonging, less stress, more free time, safety networks etc. are FAR and FAR more important to people. People are social animals in their genes! I have to keep on finishing my literature study on Economic Development. TAKE GOOD CARE and please do not believe the nonsense egocentric people like trump are telling you: they only think in their own interests, the so called BAD billionaires (they can mainly be found in Construction and (raw material) extraction). And hate is NOT great, but at least you wrote without main insults. Thanks for that.",

I see you've concentrated you're studies in Spanish and eastern European nations. So should I assume you're a Marxist. Sorry.. not buying into the despotism. Im a classical liberal not a republican. I am much more inclined to defend my individual rights and liberties than have some despotic <b> nation </b>telling me how to live under the guise of free healthcare and education. Everyone knows the right to self defence and speech does not exist in Europe. You're subjects not citizens. Especially since most of Western Europe are Monarchies that give permission to the people to self govern. Yet, the right to govern is still held by the monarchies.",

No free gun laws (in not one singel developed country anymore!): That is why Europe is so much saver than the USA (far and far less killings, and far and far less people in prison). I am normally right wing, but it depends on the circumstances and differs per country. In the USA I would of course support Clinton, as she is a super experienced and bright person, versus the total moron trump is. Was e.g. NOT a fan of Mitterand, but also did not like Chirac, but liked Felipe Gonzalez, was NOT a fan of the Olaf Palme, but liked Wim Kok, was NOT a fan of Schroeder, but did like Kohl, adored Sa Carmeiro, but also Maria da Pinta Silga, and of course am a great fan of the prime minister of Serbia (Brnabic), and dislike PIS, Erdogan and Orban (our trump disasters), so more often than not I would vote right wing in Europe (which is more or less democrat in the USA, as republican would be considered as extreme right in Europe). We are CITIZENS, as most of us vote, not like in the USA, where only the more well off do vote, as it is made extremely difficult for poor people to vote (that is why there is always a total fake bias towards republican logic, not representing the USA people), and hence the democracy is a fake one, as money rules everything, not the people. It is again the same as with your Universities: you can make a nice story, but in practice the money has the power (now Wall Street, NRA, anti climate lobby, big pharma and billionaires, some other times some other lobby groups). Monarchs in Europe have<b>  NOTHING</b> to say, so are more or less only a very appreciated binding factor (lets say: the opposite of Trump, or anti Trumps), which as such is a good thing for most of the countries, as we can vote them out with one vote, but democratically do not.  Again...take care...will leave you now, as just sported, and will still type some texts (basically concluding my literature study on Economic Development (specialising, oh fate, on Hausmann's (Harvard) Complexity theory).....",

If she says US constitution, then  there is a strong possibility that she's lying. They may be good people, but they are also closeted Islamist who'd rather opt for \"Allah's\" law than those formulated by people.  Islam is complete way of life.  No separation between church and state. Islamic law prescribes 100 lashes for unmarried <b> sex.</b>",

Sometimes these lunatics do awful things, like shoot up a synagogue or a congressional baseball game. They're awful tragedies and should be condemned by both sides equally. \n\nThe reason there isn't much to say about the Pittsburg shooting is because it was an isolated incident. The shooter didn't support Trump because he supports Israel and a strong argument could be made that the anti-Semitic vitriol coming from the left incited him as well, but it doesnt matter. He was a nut job, plain and simple. People like that don't need an excuse.\n\nPlease do some more research, from independent sources, about Israel. The news doesn't cover the entire situation and you're right, it is a complicated history, but there is no question over who the aggressor is.\n\nA country being attacked and managing to defend itself, is not the same as invading another country. That's what Israel did in the 6 day war. Since then, there have been NUMEROUS agreements and treaties which weren't broken by Israel. \n\nNow, 150 rockets can be shot at Israel schools and neighborhoods without a peep from the media, but when they defend themselves and kill a lone Muslim, it's the top story.\n\nEven Mohammed said that Jerusalem belongs to the Jews. The idea of it being holy to Muslims is a new concept. \n\nPlease read up on the conflict. There is only one objective conclusion.",

                    "commentText": "@Geert Termeer - \u200b Geert Termeer - Free speech nearly unlimited in EU huh? Then please explain why thousands are arrested, punished, jailed, fined etc.in countries like Germany, Britain and Sweden for practicing basic rights such as free speech and self defense! It's horrifying that cases such as what's happening with Tommy Robinson, is just one of 12 every day in the UK alone!\u00a0\n\nA very few EU countries technically do have a right to self defence, and to use firearms against criminal attackers. But with Most EU countries laws requiring guns to be Locked in a safe, unloaded, taken apart, and furthermore prohibiting what kind of firearm you can use and not use, and even how you may and may not use it, the most EU countries governments, have obviously rendered it impossible to use firearms for self-defense! And no matter how defenseless you are, <b> elderly,</b> young female,<b>  handicapped</b> person etc. or if you're a person in grave danger receiving death threats, or if you live in nature with dangerous wild animals, concealed and open carry is illegal in all of Europe with the exception of Swizerland where you can carry only if valid proof of your life being in danger is provided.\n\nEU safer than the US? That is a joke right???!!! All but 2 countries in EU (Switzerland and Sweden) have been invaded or have had tyranny numerous times just in the last 100 years! And it's not a coincidence that both Sweden and Switzerland along with the US (Which hasn't had tyranny or invasions at all), has the highest rates of gun ownership in the world! Switzerland being the most interesting one, with more than 45 firearms per 100 people and more than 35 per 100 people of those, are either Simi or fully automatic military firearms. Switzerland remains the only country in the world where any citizen above 18 year<b> s ol</b>d, after going through the background checks, can buy modern fully automatic firearms (Something you can't even do in the US<b> )! Nobo</b>dy dares to invade a country where almost every male citizen is armed! It is also for this reason the Japanese chose not to do a land invasion in the US. As Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto said \"'We did indeed know much about your preparedness. We knew that probably every second home in your country contained firearms. We knew that your country actually had state championships for private citizens shooting military rifles. We were not fools to set foot in such quicksand''. The safest countries also tend to be the most conservative countries that reject Socialism. Countries like the US and Switzerland. I as simple as that! \nStates like South Dakota, Minnesota, Vermont, North Dakota, Montana, Main, New Hampshire, Iowa, Idaho Wyoming Utah etc. are very peaceful states with low crimes rates and they all have some of the lowest murder rates in the entire world all below 3 out of 100,000 people!\n\nI was born in Denmark. It's one of the least free and frankly least happy 1st world countries there is! I lived in Europe for more than 20 years. I've lived and worked in China for 3 years, swell as several other countries and I currently live in the US.! Paid more than 50% taxes when I lived in DK, even though I had a very low paying job. A job that I spend 2 years looking for, as it's nearly impossible to get a job in this country. I could barely even afford the 100<b>  yr </b>old bike I was riding to work on 3 am every day, in freezing cold, rainy, stormy weather. Lift and Uber is Illegal in Denmark, and there is no public transport early in the morning. \nYou can't move a finger without having to pay some sort of tax there. You even pay taxes for paying the taxes! Additionally, you pay 25% taxes for literally everything you buy. Including a piec<b> e of f</b>ruit from a grocery store. They even have NUT TAXES. NOT A JOKE! And people always leave out the thousands of additional taxes, like the 180% car tax, and the near 300% tax for electricity!\nAlso remember that Denmark is one of the most pricey countries in the world. All prices in Denmark are on average 3 times more than in the US as an example. A lot of Danes have to buy a lot of their things, even food sometimes, from overseas because they can't afford the Danish prices.  \nOn the few days where it's warm enough to walk outside your house, one can't feel safe for one second because of the violent nature of the intoxicated Danes. One street in Denmark will look like a completely different one next year, because the amount of taxation and business sanctions are so high, that everyone trying to start a business, instantly go broke. People pay so much taxes there, that people have to storm to the banks to withdraw money after payday, because the final salary after tax, is so low, people don't have enough money to live comfort<b> ably, </b>witch is also part of the reason why so many business owners close, cause people don't have enough money to go spend. The low quality of life shows clearly in the transportation choosings of the Danes. Few people own cars in Denmark! In fact, even Iraq has more vehicles per capita than Denmark. The few that do transport via automobiles, will mostly drive in very low quality, small, soulless hatchbacks. The Danes mostly transport themselves with public transport or bikes. And it's certainly not out of pleasure they do it as the weather is absolutely horrific!\nAnd oh, isn't it fun to receive letters from the government of Denmark, requiring peaceful, tax paying citizens to do this and that at this time and place, otherwise they will send police with guns, and take you to jail. It really makes my day receiving threats from the government. I'm of cause referring to the mandatory military service, which Denmark still has and several other EU countries still has! One of the most anti freedom things in existence!\n\nThere are so many regulations and laws in Denmark, one can almost not move a pinky without breaking some kind of law. My Grandfather can't count the times he's been arrested and fined for carrying a damn multitool! The knife on it is no more than 2 inches but it's still considered illegal and he's forced to pay the government thousands of dollars. Yes they have knife control in Denmark! I also know a guy who decided about 6 years ago to sit in his own garden and <b> eat an</b> apple. Sounds pretty innocent right! NOT IN DENMARK! He used a knife to <b> cut th</b>e a<b> pple</b>, an old lady saw this from the window and called the police! The police showed up at his door step. They confiscated his knife, he had to pay almost 500 dollars in fine and he spent a week in jail. Ohh, what an evil man he was for <b> eating</b> an apple! It happens frequently that professional cooks and chefs are having to pay thousands of dollars in fine for having their knifes in the car. There even was a time in the 90s where it was illegal to dig holes in beaches. WHY? Because somebody twisted an angle as he accidentally stepped into a hole a child had dug. But fear not, because the government would swoop in to save the day with another nonsensical regulation of insanity. I myself have been arrested and fined for sleeping outside, iv'e been attacked by a whole force of police with dogs, arrested and heavily fined for making a campfire to keep me and my friend warm so we wouldn't freaking die. Iv'e been arrested for setting up a tent etc. I also have stories about family members of mine, dying a<b> t 40</b> years old in their hospitals. Hospitals that are so bad, my dear aunt didn't even die from hear actual illness. She died on Christmas from the sheer depression, and horrible food from those depression bunkers they in DK call Hospitals. Hospitals that we pay between 50% to 65% and often higher taxes for, not to mention the hundreds of other additional taxes people pay there. This is what happens when governments are centralized and it irrefutably is the very opposite of freedom! Frankly dictatorial in my opinion!!!\nI don't need to go further than 20 years back where most people could walk into gun stores and buy guns without permits, but once they start taking a little, at some point they will take it all. That applies to pretty much all EU countries and as a matter of fact most countries in EU, especially Sweden, Germany, France, Spain and the UK have seen dramatic increases in crimes rates in the past decades, right alongside and in coexistence with the constant increases in gun regulations.\n \nAll that time I lived in DK, I almost never went outdoors, which greatly of cause has to do with the horrible weather, and the fact that anything fun and educational is either too expensive, not possible or banned in DK. I did the best I could to keep a low profile, and not get into trouble. Yet, Iv'e been through these things, and yet despite of doing my best to avoid confrontations with the Danes, I can't get away from people mocking, and yelling at me cause they don't like the way I dress. Denmark among the happiest countries in the world? Yeah..Meanwhile the Danes themselves, are researching about why the Danes have such high depression and suicide rates and why the Danes always look so displeased and angry. When I was in High school in DK, 1/4 of my classmates suffered from depression and they would sometimes break out in tears in the middle of the classroom from pure misery!\nForeign journalist travel there and ask, \"Why is Denmark a great place to live?\" They put on the most ridiculously sad face and mention High taxes and free health care. Like THAT'S the key to happiness? Hopefully most people watching that, can recognize the irony and get a laugh out of it!\n\nTo be continued....",

                    "commentText": "@Geert Termeer  - A couple of facts!\n \nDenmark ranked first for land use(lowest amount of nature)\ncancer: The highest cancer rate for men and women together was found in Denmark\n5th highest: Cost of living > Transport prices\n8th highest among developed countries: Crime > Total crimes per 1000\nDenmark ranked first for tax > highest marginal tax rate\nDenmark ranked first for spending\nDenmark has had the highest municipal wastes (commonly known as trash or garbage)\n\nThe Danish government have almost totally depleted the country from all nature, which has led to the dying out of thousands of species like wolfs, wild boars and elks. So even if the people of Denmark where doing good and where free, what about the animals and the wildlife. Most of it doesn't even exist anymore!\n\nIt's also among the most gloomiest countries in the world: Iceland, Scotland, Ireland, Northern-Ireland, Wales, Norway, England, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania.\n\nOne can also take history into account. We don't need to go further back than world war 2, to a time when Denmark and most of Europe and big parts of the world was invaded and controlled by Germany. How free and happy was Countries like Denmark at this time? Undeniably not very free or happy from what my grandparents tell me as they lived through this. Strongly armed and free countries like the US and Switzerland on the other hand, have remained uninvaded, free, happy and prosperous for hundreds of years! \n\n So what about the freedom of choice. Denmark obviously has a VERY large government. Since so many here on this comment section are on the subject of healthcare, I would like to point out that the US has the highest quality healthcare in the entire world! The US has the lowest Hospital death rate in the world 15 out of the 30 best hospitals in the world are all in the US, and YES the health care is expensive in the US, because it's leading in medical innovation! Universal Health care suppresses the freedom of medical innovation, private <b> doctors </b>and hospitals etc. in EU. Good quality is not cheap, and most insurances and even medicare covers all prescription medicine and even such things as private physicians coming to your house is also \"free\" in the US. \u00a0\nIn the US you can choose from many hundreds of health care plans and you can even choose to have no health care plan at all and just pay the hospitals directly. In a country like Denmark, the health care IS controlled by the government, therefor a socialistic element. You get one mandatory healthcare plan, pretty much no choice or flexibility what so ever. Unless you're a millionaire and could afford a private insurance company in DK. But only royalties can afford that. That means it's dependent on the government and if the government is in bad shape the hospitals will be in bad shape. \nAnd back to the flexibility point, I'de like to take myself as an example. I've struggled my whole life with allergies, hay fever and rash etc. In spite of thousands of hospital visits, I've never received actual treatment for it because western medicine does not offer any cure for such internal illnesses. And even when I would do my own research and find my way to such things as immunotherapy, the<b>  doctors</b> would deny me treatment, even though I had already paid for it through taxes. And I paid more than 65% taxes sometimes. Acupuncture is one of the few methods known to improve these conditions of mine, and of caus<b> e nobod</b>y, unless you are extremely rich, can afford both paying more than 50% taxes for healthcare (that denies you service), then afterwards pay for your private acupuncture treatment. It's not until I moved to the US I've been able to receive treatment. I pay the fee, the doctor performs the service, and now I can finally live a comfortable life. I never got an education in Denmark either, cause this is government controlled as well! The government offers you a set of educations you can choose from, and you already paid for it through coercion, so it's take it or leave it! The only education I was close to getting, was the mandatory military service. Pretty damn scary receiving a letter from the government commanding and ordering people to be at this place, at that time or they will send men with guns and lock ya in a cage! As a person who have lived in and traveled to several socialist countries, I personally find it carry to see elements of socialism like government controlled health care in our civilized countries cause it never turns out well, and many countries in Europe are in major trouble from embracing this. We should never entrust governments with so much responsibilities! And Denmark isn't even one of the bad countries in EU!\n\nAs for your comment about Venezuela not being Democratic Socialism, but dictatorship. If you have all those fancy educations you claim to have, it's a little scary you would say something so incredibly uneducated! Is Dictatorship an ideology? NO, it's a form of government! How is it achieved? With socialism, or democratic socialism if you prefer. Venezuela is a socialistic country. The government controls the means of production. Socialism IS dictatorial as it dictates how people should think, behave, dress etc. Democratic Socialism is what they have in China. The Government Controls the means of production and they have a democratic system where the people can choose their leaders. \n\nYou've clearly never been to the US! If you have, you must have stayed in a horrible state like Californistan, the battlefield of Chicago, or the SJW state of New York!",

                    "commentText": "@AL\u00c9XANDROS Sorry to hear about your private problems, but also sorry to tell you that you are NOT the world, and NOT form a country. There are other people living in countries, that is why there is research, which result in facts. E.g for safety: Iceland is nr 1, Denmark 2, Austria 3, Finland 4, Singapore 5, New Zealand 6 and let me select some other countries: 12. Norway, 14 Netherlands, 16 Germany. USA IS ON PLACE 52, next to Cambodia and Equatorial <b> Guinea </b>and Gambia. The top safest countries are mainly European. SORRY FOR REALITY. According to the World Happiness Report (under guidance of the United Nations) the top 10 happiest countries are (period 2015-2017): 1) Finland; 2) Norway; 3) Denmark; 4) Iceland; 5) Switzerland; 6) Netherlands; 7) Canada; 8) New Zealand; 9) Sweden;10) Australia. USA again NOT in the top. SORRY FOR THE FACTS. Now you probably, as a trump supporter, will say that the facts are not correct, and the world is not round, but there are many different indicators from many different institutes and they more or less come, of course, to the same results. I lived in the Netherlands and the thing I loved most was biking. Total FREEDOM. Having to take the polluting car to nearly everywhere is a disaster, and not only because of environmental reasons (by the way if you want to talk about KILLING: climate change is the real killer, with now over 7.000.000 deaths per year (by the way also there the USA is BAD in the listing). My mother was a Christian, and hence we were not even allowed to play with plastic guns (you know Jesus his preaching)! As for Switzerland: Switzerland thus has a relatively high gun ownership rate. There are no official statistics, and estimates vary considerably. It is the ONLY developed and decent country, which allows guns. ALL others banned it, and hence the killing rate dropped spectacularly in ALL these banning countries. Australia being the last one. Why Switzerland did not become a Somalia or USA is a very very interesting question. If you want to do a PhD, it might be a real interesting topic. On the lists of countries per NET income Denmark is nr. 7 and the USA is nr. 5, but if you clean that for inequality (removing the Koch brothers, Gates, Zuckerberg etc), than of course the average Dane earns FAR more than the average American. IF you clean that, again, for per hour work, than the difference is shockingly in favour of Denmark, which works far less hours and has far more paid vacation days. Now of course a lot has also to do with the Dollar exchange rate. Anyhow....your PERSONAL feelings are important FOR YOU, but obviously do NOT reflect total reality. So sorry for having to wake you up. You might want to start looking for real facts, as the sources you get them from are clearly WRONG. If you base yourself on Fox State tv, I can imagine where the bias comes from. If you base yourself on trump, of course also: than use the following rule, with now nearly 30 (!) lies a day DOCUMENTED the best is to do the following: Trump says something, the truth and reality is NEARLY for sure the total opposite. Wish you all the best with starting to study FACT and get rid of your frustrations somehow. Good luck with that!",

You complain about me not stating sources, yet you go on yourself to make baseless claims without providing one single source! You kidding me? First of all, the general idea that you compare small individual EU countries to a huge superpower, where every single state is sovereign and has their own state government is absolutely laughable, and it once again proves you know squad about the US and that you've never lived here!\n\nOK here are some real stats and reality on safety, with sources!\nBut first take note that many of the links I post are simply the broadcasters of the stats and are not the direct sources for these statistics. They originate form government institutions like FBI, CIA or Forbes, National center for health, British Home Office, Australian Institute of Criminology etc.\n\nAs an example, general mortality rate is quite a bit higher in the UK, Lithuania, Ukraine, Italy, Poland, Sweden etc. and most EU countries as a matter of fact compared to the US, which clearly shows on the map, which link for I've added below .\n\nDeath rate= Average annual number of deaths during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate.\n\nUNITED STATES         Between 7-8         (2006) EST.\nEUROPE                       Between 9-10       (2006) EST.\n\nSource:   [LINK]  \n\nUpdated CIA stats from 2017 show equal results where most EU countries rank between 9.20 to 14.60. A Lot higher than the US rated at 8.20. Crude death rate stats for individual US states do not exist.\n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nCRUDE DEATH RATE! That means it includes all causes of death. Including all kinds of homicide, car deaths, deaths through <b> alcohol,</b> cancer,<b>  old</b<b> > ag</b>e, Infant Mortality Rate, Neonatal Mortality Rate etc. etc etc.\n\nAnd the notion that Europe in general is safer than the US <b> is nothi</b>ng but silly! How many world wars came out of the US? Non where even started by 2nd or 3rd world countries, they both came out of EU. How many Berlin walls have been build in the US? And how many times have the US had dictators or dictatorship? NON! EU has had more dictatorships in the last century than I can count, and many of them I've never even heard of!\u00a0\n\nAnt\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar in Portugal\nMikl\u00f3s Horthy de Nagyb\u00e1nya in Hungary,\u00a0\nIoannis Metaxas in Greece,\u00a0\nColonel Georgios Papadopoulos in Greece \nIon Victor Antonescu in Romania\nTodor Hristov Zhivkov in People's Republic of Bulgaria\nAnte Paveli\u0107 fascist leader in Croatia\nWojciech Witold Jaruzelski in Poland  \nNicolae Ceau\u0219escu in Romania\nFrancisco Franco Bahamonde in Spain\nBenito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini in Italy\nAdolf Hitler in German\netc.\n\nNot to mention the generals in power that made Germany a dictatorship after WW1.\nThis is just a few I could find from a couple of minutes of searching and I'm not even including the Soviet Union dictators, even though the western 23% of the Russia is located in Europe and European Russia occupies almost 40% of Europe's total area.\n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nAnd as late as yesterday, it seems Ukraine and Russia is on the brink of war ONCE AGAIN, opening fire at each other. And looking at a map, it's vividly clear Europe have more bombings, shootings and terror attacks in general. In fact if you compare 2015 and 2016 to the US, EU doesn't even look that much different from the Middle East.\n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\n\"According to the World Happiness Report (under guidance of the United Nations)\" - You can stop it right there! Happiness is not something that can be directly measured in numbers! Can you measure every happy person out of 100.000 people HAHAAH. NO! Stats work, indexes (as in happiness index) doesn't! Do you know what index means? It means an indicator, or sign of something.\u00a0But if we where to go with this wired index report, the US is ranked 15 which would be a very good score for such a large country. Some of the most unhappy AND happiest places in all 1st world countries, are in the US. Just imagine how happy people must be in some of the individual states to drive the number so high! But look realistically at this let me ask you something. If countries like Norway, Austria, Finland etc. are so happy and are so much more happy than the US combined, why do they have sky high depression rates? \n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nWhy do they all have sky high suicide rates compared to the US combined?\n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nAnd why is Japan always ranked as one of the least depressed countries in the world, while they have the 10th highest suicide rate in the ENTIRE world?  \nAnd why are so many 2nd and 3rd world countries, where people are dying like flies, placed so high on the list? This link below should be enough proof why these Happiness indexes are clearly flawed, or don't work!\n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nHere is some simple logic. If people are happy, they are not depressed and they certainly don't kill themselves in high numbers! \n\nAND No! I, am sorry to break the reality to YOU! You would have to be intoxicated or psychedelic to even for a split second, believe the realism and truthfulness of these happiness and safety indexes! Let me tell you this! Reality does not take place in the computer, or in the cellphone (that you wouldn't have if it wasn't for the US!) that you are writing this from! It happens out here in the real world. I've lived for several years with people from the Finland and Norway and Austria (Some of the countries with the highest happiness indexes) and Ive been to these countries myself! They where not the saddest people I've met, but they sure as hell weren't the happiest either! And ALL the most rude, miserable people I've ever met, came from nowhere other than EU, from Italy and Spain more precisely. The happiest place I've ever lived is here in Colorado. It's incredible that after a year and a half living here, not a SINGLE person has acted rude towards me, or seemed sad and depressed. People are overjoyed and blissful here, talkative, polite and I often catch people singing from happiness. And there are many states that are much happier than here! In a place like California I can't walk out one day without somebody being rude towards me, and in some countries in EU like Denmark, or even worse cases like Italy, Portugal or Spain, almost everybody with few exceptions, seem extremely depressed and sad, rude, obnoxious and even ruin the day for a lot of happy people they encounter.\u00a0\n\n\"Having to take the polluting car to nearly everywhere is a disaster<b> \" - Nob</b>ody is \"HAVING\" to use a car! 50 feet from where I'm sitting right now there are at least 15 bikes parked, and people drive to work on them every day, even now in the winter, because the weather is so comfortable here with more than 300 days of sunshine a year. And oh year, how horrible it is to have the luxury owning a car so you can drive everywhere you want. Total freedom huh? Apparently you don't understand the word freedom either. One of the basic elements of the word freedom, is freedom from constraint in choices. Transporting oneself by bike constrains how far you can drive, thus constraint in freedom of travel! You know which countries statistically have the most pollution? The countries where people tend to drive more on bikes and scooters! Countries like China where only until quite recently everybody without exception drove on bikes. Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, UAE, Mongolia, India, Bahrain, Nepal, Ghana, Jordan, China, Senegal, Turkey, Bulgaria, Mauritius, Peru, Serbia, Iran etc. are the most polluted countries in the world and they are all among the countries with the least vehicles per capita!\n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\n\nTo be Continued....",

US is \"BAD\" in this listing huh? they are on the top 20 least polluted countries in the world and states like Wyoming have the cleanest air in the world! Climate change is the \"REAL\" killer. HUH! First of all there is no way to prove that, and there is no way to prove if the climate wouldn't be changing if humans weren't here, as the climate has always been changing! Hard facts and actual death counts, DO exist on the other hand to prove how many have been killed as a direct result of Socialism. Billions of people have been killed from socialism and are being killed to this very day. In Socialist China alone, little children are killed by the hundreds of millions by the government or abducted and sold as <b> sex </b>slaves, or sold to pharmasutical organizations and hospitals where they are slaughtered and their vital organs sold to the highest bidder. In fact my wife from China, have lost several friends because of this and she has friends that have lost children and loved ones to it. I could never imagine what the total annual death toll would be, if all the numbers of dead could be compiled. Unfortunately anybody trying to do research on this in Socialist countries are often killed by the government. But if we look at democide, socialist and<b>  communist</b> governments have from 1900 to 1999, disarmed and killed more than 262,000,000 civilians. Most professionals say it's far more though as most democides are kept secret. And if you include the soldiers killed, the number climbs way above 500,000,000 people. \n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\n\"As for Switzerland: Switzerland thus has a relatively high gun ownership rate. There are no official statistics, and estimates vary considerably.\" - Both right and wrong. More than 30% of the Swiss own either Fully or semi automatic military rifles. This is provable because they are registered! The reason why I say more, is because it wasn't required to register military style firearms until just recently, so there is a large percentage of non registered legally owned military firearms. And, the vast majority of firearms owned in Switzerland are \"Hunting weapons\". And they don't even require registration, so there is most likely much more than 50 firearms per 100 people! In fact, some estimate it to be as much as 60 per 100 people.\n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\n\"It is the ONLY developed and decent country, which allows guns\" - If you are as educated as you claim to be, why is literally EVERY SINGLE sentence you write factually wrong? The countries where guns are completely banned are socialist countries like China, North Korea and Venezuela. You know which countries have the most gun ownership? They also happen to be the most developed countries with the highest living standards! Do you know that in the country where you live or used to lived, 45 out of 100 people own guns? Sweden, Norway, France, Austria, Canada, Germany, and Iceland all have more than 30 firearms per 100 people! So by your standards, you are literally telling me these are not developed or decent countries! I thought you liked Europe! So you consider 2nd and 3rd world countries developed and decent countries? And I own guns in DK, is Denmark not considered a developed country either? \n\n\"ALL others banned it, and hence the killing rate dropped spectacularly in ALL these banning countries. Australia being the last one.\" - Ohh Bless you're heart! Generally speaking most EU countries have been implementing more and more gun control and most EU countries have seen dramatic increases in assault, threats, robbery, harassment, and especiall<b> y se</b>x crimes in the past couple decades! \n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nIn all cases where guns have been banned, all statistics show murder and crime rates double and even triple! 5 to 10 years after the ban they tend to decrease, and drop down to the exact same numbers right before the ban. Here are stats for UK, Ireland, Jamaica!\u00a0\n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nIn both Germany, France, UK, Poland and Italy, crime has more than doubled since the 60s and they are still increasing. Crime in the UK overall has in the last year alone increased 15%. Murder in the last year has increased by 44%! \n\nSource:  [LINK] \n [LINK] \n\nSame for Australia! After they came for them, the murder rate almost doubled immediately! Robbery and even armed doubled and property crime became a big issue in the following years.\n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nMore over, they where only able to get 1/3 of them. Now, Australias crime rate has fallen in the last years, but their gun-ownership rate rate has increased to 5 times that of before the ban! After the ban, gun murders specifically where reduced, but knife crimes went up at the exact rate the gun crimes went down. Murderers kept killing, they just switched to another tool, and off cause citizens where left defenseless. Australias murder and overall crime rate has continuously and steadily been reducing decade after decade in Australia, and the only time a drastic increase was observed was immediately after the ban!\n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nDo you seriously support the government busting into law-abiding, taxpaying peoples house and taking their guns! If you do, you are an absolute authoritarian and your views in guns are no different than those of dictators like Hitler, Mao, Stalin, Mussolini etc. They all disarmed their citizens before enslaving their own people. An unarmed population is a weak, enslaved population easy to control, and gun free zones are invitations to criminals. It's estimated that 98% of all mass murders happen in gun free Zones? Banning guns also increases t<b> he bla</b>ck gun market. In Denmark, which has extreme tight gun control, I have friends who bought guns, and even sold guns, on <b> the bl</b>ack market as early as 15 year<b> s of</b> age.\n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nAre you aware that US states like Utah, Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Vermont, New Hampshire, Main etc. all are among the states with either the highest gun ownership rates or states with the most lax gun laws and are also among the US states, and on the world stage, among the places with the lowest murder rates in the world! All rated below 3 per 100.000 and some even below 1, only trumped by few countries in EU.\nDo you have any idea how many are saved by guns in the US? FBI has estimated that every year 500,000 to more than 2.5 million times per year guns are used by civilians to save someones life in the US. Now contrast that to the 5,100 annual gun murders in the US. And only 260 people are killed by civilians in the US every year. That means the overwhelmingly majority of the times, guns are used by civilians to either deter or arrest someone, not to kill! The US has more firearms now than ever, and crime rates have decreased by 48% and all the way up to 74%, and overall crime is supposed to be down by 62% since the early 90s.\n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\n\nTo be continued....",

IF you clean that, again, for per hour work, than the difference is shockingly in favour of Denmark, which works far less hours and has far more paid vacation days\" - Is that why Americans are able to live in houses twice the size of the average EU sized house, and on the side of that own large pieces of land? And is that why Americans are often able to own several cars, that also tend to be far bigger than the average sized EU car. <b> Nobody </b>that I know in Denmark, family or friends, have ever gotten a paid vacation! The Income in Denmark is not worth much, when you pay more than 50 percent income taxes, more than 25 VAT/MOMS, 300% for electricity etc. etc. and a million taxes hidden in the system that most people don't even know about! More importantly, I've estimated that everything on average cost 3 times the price in Denmark compared to US prices. There is a reason why 50 percent of Danes try to buy most things from overseas. \nA few random examples. A shitty Wolkswagen Golf R, cost more than 600.000 KR, and a Volkswagen Touareg, is more than a million KR. That's the same as what you pay for a brand new hand made 2018 Aston Martin (price is around $ 250.000, or 1.25 million KR) or several 2019 Jaguar XJ price is only $72,272! For contrast, the same 2018 Aston Martin model cost around $1 million or 5.782.642 kr in DK. And the Jaguar XJ in DK is $1.5 million or around $280.000.  \nI bought a Remington 870 express super magnum shotgun in DK. Good<b>  old</b> make and model. Price in the US is 380$ (2300 KR). In Denmark I paid 1310.24 US Dollar 8000 (KR) for the damn thing! \nA gallon of organic whole milk is 50% higher price in Denmark compared with the US!\nI live in a rather cheap apartment in the US. It's mainly low income people that live here, but many of the people that live in the building own two different cars and drive big luxurious SUVs or Chryslers. Many rich people in Denmark can't afford those cars. And it's not uncommon for Americans to own several houses. And the houses in the US are much larger and more luxurious than that of DK. Average size of houses built in the US is 2,700 square feet. Compare this to EU countries:\nDenmark: 1,475sf \nFrance: 1,216sf \nSpain: 1,044sf\nIreland: 947sf\nUK: 818sf\n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nBut let's look at some actual statistics, of how much more money Americans really have compared to other countries. I know you like that, or maybe not?\nStudies from Forbes show that the poorest bottom 10% of the US earn more than the bottom 10% of Sweden, Australia, Britain, Germany, Poland, Japan, France, Italy etc. In fact the only country where the poor are doing a little tiny bit better, is in Canada. And this is of course just when you look at the US as a whole (which logically isn't fair). When you compare individual states, you will find even better rates, but obviously also worse rates from certain states. And the top 10% are doing far better in the US than in any other country from this survey, which is because of Capitalism that allow business, trade and manufacturing to thrive and allows the US to have the highest GDP in the world, and this in the end allows for overall better treatment and better options to the bottom 10%.\n\nSource:  [LINK] \n\nIf you wanna talk about a country that's got Economic inequalities then let's look at Denmark.\nIn the US, you will receive the same salary no matter what your skin tone! In Denmark, if you are from the Middle East or from Poland you are only entitled to half the salary of caucasians! Not by decision of your employer but by national law. Which is why it's almost impossible for caucasians, like me, to get a job there, cause employers only want to hire foreigners! I worked in a glass house when I was 18. And when one turns 18, you must by law receive twice your current salary. Employer can't afford that, so you get fired. But all the foreigners they stayed behind of cause. Is that equality? \n\n\"Anyhow....your PERSONAL feelings are important FOR YOU, but obviously do NOT reflect total reality.\" - Please point out where I said I feel or I felt, or generally a place where I expressed my feelings! Everything I wrote previously, is based in facts, personal experience, and self acquired wisdom! \n\n\"as the sources you get them from are clearly WRONG. If you base yourself on Fox State tv, I can imagine where the bias comes from.\" - Straw man! Where did I mention Fox? And did you just write Fox state tv? If it was run by the state, they would undoubtedly be a left wing News Network station! Fox News is a United States pay television news channel owned by the Fox Entertainment Group. None of the things I wrote are from Fox, but in the defense of Fox News, they are among the most accredited news networks in the US, and they have one of the highest approval ratings, so clearly you are the one being biased! My sources are FBI, CIA, Forbes, National center for health, Australian Institute of Criminology etc. and generally just multiple government institutions and research centers, and sometimes I get it from Wiki. And I get my news from all outlets there are, including private independent ones. I always make sure to hear the voices from all sides, then fact-check and conclude!\n\n \"If you base yourself on trump, of course also: than use the following rule, with now nearly 30 (!) lies a day DOCUMENTED\" - Aaaand Straw man! Where did I say \"I say I base myself off of Trump\". If it's \"DOCUMENTED\" why don't you show or refer me to the document or mention even one single of his lies? You bash Fox, and then talk about researches made by Mainstream medias like CNN and MSNBC, which have less than 50% approval ratings. 90 percent of those so-called lies are just twisted by the media to make them sound like lies, and another part of it is just misinterpreted. It shows how deluded you are saying you'd prefer Hillary Clinton for president! She is famous and has always been famous for lying, and it's not just small silly lies we are talking in that case! \n\n\nTo be continued....",

                    "commentText": "@Geert Termeer  - \"Having guns does NOT protect you against invasions. That Japanese opinion must be totally nonsense, as Japan  invaded country after country, island after island.\" - Japan prepared for a long war. However, they did hold out hope that a decisive victory at Pearl Harbor would lead to a quick resolution. Yamamoto, in particular, was pessimistic about Japan's ability to fight a protracted war with the U.S. and hoped for a quick peace. Years after the war, US Commander Menard and Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto sat down as allies and conversed. Someone at the table asked the Japanese admiral \"Why, with the Pacific Fleet devastated at Pearl Harbor and the mainland U.S. forces in what Japan HAD to know was a pathetic state of unreadiness, Japan had not simply invaded the West Coast\". Commander Menard would never forget the crafty look on the Japanese commander's face as he frankly answered the question. '\"You are right'' he told the Americans. ''We did indeed know much about your preparedness. We knew that probably every second home in your country contained firearms. We knew that your country actually had state championships for private citizens shooting military rifles. We were not fools to set foot in such quicksand.'' Switzerland and the US are the most armed countries on earth, and they are among the only countries, with the only exception of Sweden (which surprisingly also has a lot of guns), that hasn't been invaded or had tyrannical governments! That in itself is proof enough! And the point of an armed population is really not actually to actively fight back, it is to simply be there as a deterrent. That is why Switzerland purposely arm their citizens, and why the US has the 2 amendment in the first place!\n\n\"Many of them with citizens with guns. In those days Americans did not have so much guns, compared to e.g. the countries invaded by the Japanese.\" - Are you kidding me! The Americans invented the gun! And back to the time you are talking about which is 70 years ago (as that's the last time they invaded China) the total amount of Firearms in the US was less, but there where actually more guns per 100 capita back then, ergo more gun owners in the US! And almost all Asian countries at that time, where dictatorial regimes that prohibited firearms and they still do to this day. As a man who's lived in China, I can tell you China has almost always been a shit-hole! The ONLY time China was a decent civilized country to live in, was under Sun Yat-Sen during Xinhai Revolution, and surprise, it is also the only time where China allowed its citizens to own firearms. You see Sun Yat-sen copied the capitalist idea of the US. Then Mao came, disarmed the populous, and mass-murdered more than 50 million people. Don't be ignorant, there is a reason why EVERY single dictator disarms the people before they take over, and it's happened as recently as in Venezuela!\n\n\"I understand you want to shoot guns at cluster bombs and tanks.\" - Yet another Straw man argument! Where did I say that? \n\n\"(by the way also your Switzerland was invaded by the Germans, I think even in several days?)\" - Proof? Swiss neutrality was an armed neutrality. The Swiss haven't been involved in any wars since 1847, and they are famous for having had no invasions or tyrannical government for more than 600 years. \n\n [LINK] \n\n\"Can you please state the SOURCES of your facts, as it seems you make up your own facts. That is NOT how it works. We are NOT working on trump logic, but on reality\" - The Very reason why the country is doing so well under trump is because we have a leader with a good sense of logic, living in reality and not a textbook life like most politicians. Most politicians have never done an honest job in their life or created one single job. Trump on the other hand has created thousands in his own business and millions during his presidency. And you've clearly never watched any of his speeches as most of what he talks about during them are facts and statistics. \nI didn't list any sources in my previous text as it takes many many hours to pull them up, and they are tenths of thousands of hours worth of reading material and I honestly didn't expect anybody would be interested in spending hours reading it. Now I've listed at least a dozen of sources, and I still doubt you or anybody will really take the time to read all of that.\n\nThere are both good and bad countries in EU as there are good and bad states in the US. For you to sit there behind your screen and act knowledgeable and intellectual, demonizing the US in such a generalizing manner, from basically a piece of paper is as naive as it gets!\u00a0You therefor clearly don't understand how the US works, but let me enlighten you and shed some light on the topic of US state sovereignty! The Tenth Amendment expresses the principle of federalism and states' rights, which strictly supports the entire plan of the original Constitution for the United States of America, by stating that the federal government possesses only those powers delegated to it by the United States Constitution. All remaining powers are reserved for the states or the people. This is why every US state is almost as different from each other, as the different countries in Europe. Every state is unique in its own way. They have their own governments, laws, culture, nature, accents, climate etc. Hence, the statistics you have presented, are profoundly generalized. When digging into those crude stats of yours, which only reveals the median numbers of the US, you'll find many negative numbers, but you'll also find much better numbers!\nAnd without you having even lived in the US, you are in no way entitled to do so. What I derive from what you've written, is that you've spend most of your life in School in study, and you said you did it because you enjoy it. I don't know how <b> old </b>you are, but judging from what you've written and all the miscomprehension and fallacies you've stated about the land of the free, it sounds like you're living your life in a textbook! Quite like all the dictators do, spending their lives reading about how beautiful Socialism and Communism sounds, but having no clue about how it functions in real life. Now I'm not insinuating you are a dictator, haha, or in the slightest way resemble one, of course not! I Imagine you are a very kind young student, and being that you are from Finland, that's highly likely! But I hope you recognize how ignorant these comparisons of yours was, and acknowledge that you can't judge a country of 50 sovereign states from a piece of paper, that only contains generalized statistics.",

Once again, the US is among the 20 least polluted countries on the planet! And that's totally amazing when considering the US is one of the two countries with most production! You know I used to do the exact same thing your doing right now! I've been listening to politicians and scientist predicting the end of civilization for 10 years. They predict the end of the world every single year. If we go back to the 2008 estimates, we're not even supposed to be here right now! I used to warn my family about solar storms, and the poles melting. They keep telling us it's getting hotter, yet every year we also get colder winters. The climate is always changing, and it'll keep changing regardless if us humans are here or not. Remember during the last Ice <b> age,</b> when large parts of the planet was almost uninhabitable, homo sapiens (modern humans) and homo neanderthalensis (neanderthals) where still living in caves, but that dramatic climate change still happened. I'm not a denier of climate change! But if you choose to live your life like this, with your tail tucked up between your legs, you'll live a sad paranoid life! \nTrump has done the only right thing for the climate and nature in the US! Which is to give back thousands of thousands of acres of government stolen nature back to the people, so the government and some politicians in a suit thousands of miles away can't destroy it.

A country rated to be the 16th most polluted country on earth, a country that until 1989 was a<b>  Communist</b> dictatorship. Which brings up yet another dictator coming out of Europe. Todor Hristov Zhivkov who was th<b> e communis</b>t leader of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. I really wonder how many dictators Europe has had at this point!\nGood food and a Nice cost line Huh?

                    "commentText": "\u200b@TheThought2be  - Well how about WW2 survivors.        [LINK] \nMy grand parent lived In Denmark when Denmark was occupied as well.\n\n\"Because that sounds like bullshit and you do realize that it was the demonization of minorities that made the holocaust one of the greatest evils out there, right?\" - Social Justice is exactly what causes demonization of minorities! Social justice is a socialist term used by fascists. It was in fact promoted by German fascists and it refers to justice having to be applied to collectivist groups. So one could be adjudicated guilty by ones identity and punished accordingly because everything some jews did was because they were jewish. If one banker is corrupt all banking is corrupt and every banker should be made to pay. And being punished for ones identity and viewpoints, is undeniably what's happening in many European countries, where thousands of people are punished or jailed for the practice of free speech! As an example, in the UK, it's estimated that 12 people a day are arrested for saying something the government doesn't like.\n\n [LINK] \n\n [LINK] \n\nIt's horrifying that cases such as what's happening with Tommy Robinson, is just one of 12 every day in the UK alone!\n\u200bTheThought2be and anybody that sees this reply, If you aren't informed on the Tommy Robinson case, I urge you to look it up, so you can see how countries like the UK treats it's citizens when they arrest them for speech! \n\nGo to 7.40 in the video below where Tommy starts talking about his latest prison visit (most of it spend in solitary), for saying something the government didn't like. \n [LINK]   \n\nOr watch this video for the short version.\n [LINK] \n\nIf you've watched this video, remember, Tommy is statistically just 1 out of 12 people every day having to deal with this, in this case in the UK!\n\nSocial justice is a term not considered by people on the right apart from Freidman, and the only time he spoke of the term, he dismissed it as dangerous because it led to individuals, who were innocent, being punished for the viewpoints of an entire group. Thus a group could be dehumanized to the point the state could slaughter them in the twisted notion, that the state was protecting mankind. Social Justice was the justification for genocide by fascists and communists.\n\n\"It had <b> nothing </b>to do with education.\" - Is that a joke? The Education was a major tool by which the Nazis' racial policies were promoted and implemented. The Schools where government controlled and it was made free. It was, as Kitty Werthmann put it, \"nationalized\" which the direct definition of is: Transfer (a major branch of industry or commerce) from private to state ownership or control. Which is exactly what I said!\n\n [LINK] \n\nIt's true the Nazis had health care. They inherited the tradition from Bismarck, who set up the first national health system in the world (after unifying Germany in 1871).\n\nBut there was a difference between<b>  Nazi</b> health care and the systems under the German Empire and the Weimar Republic. Hitler rearranged the system under a strict regime of central government control, so all insurance-scheme managers reported straight to Berlin. Later \u2014 and not through the insurance companies \n\n [LINK] \n\nIsn't this logical? Dictators always promise free stuff in order to brainwash the populous. In order for a government to become dictatorial and control a population, it's certainly not done by removing power and control and decentralizing the government! In fact, I can as a foreigner go right now and get free University education in China. Sounds nice right, problem is they will brainwash you. I was told this when I lived and worked in China! You go ahead and put your natural given rights in the hands of the governments if you want to, but know this! Anyone who wish to give up a little freedom for a little security, deserve non and will get neither!",

He is trying to save us ALL and clearly the democrats car<b> e nothin</b>g about life, liberty or pursuit of happiness. Killing babies? Fighting for control at all costs? destroying communities and other countries just so they can pretend to be heroes of the same damn issues they created. Lying to your face, because they know the stupid ones will follow them with false promises of retribution, health care, free money.. LMFAO. Think about what type of people would get free money? Not the ones that make America Great for YOU and YOUR CHILDREN. Just the opposite.. TAKE MONEY from the ones TRYING to Make America Great Again. Wake up.. smell the coffee and be part of the solution, NOT the problem. Its more than just about you and your disregard f<b> or comm</b>on sense and intelligence.. its about that little one that needs you or that little one you might bring into this world. Understand.. the stupidity of today is going to be your consequence of tomorrow. Other countries WISH they had President Trump.. because.. they are where we are heading and then it will be too late to explain to your kids and grandkids why life is so bad. Will you tell them you are why?",

Now I don't know about you, but that doesn't sound like much of a choice. And 70 years later, there is still war and tension between Palestine and the Zionist sate of Israel. This should not be all that surprising. Simply put, you cannot steal someone's land, offer them a 'two-state solution' and claim you don't understand why they turned it down. \u270c\ud83c\udffc",

In 1948, Jews fleeing from Germany at the end of WW2 were seeking refuge in Palestine and at the time there were already Jews living in Palestine prior to1948. But it wasn't enough to flee from persecution(Germany) to safety (Palestine) Jews wanted their own country. Now the problem with that, and the reason why there has been fighting for the past 70 years, is simply that THERE WERE PEOPLE LIVING IN PALESTINE. And so, Palestinians were told they have to pack up and leave their homes, cities, and country to make room for Israel. Now I don't know about you, but I would not be happy if someone told me I had to pack up and leave my country. Also, out of curiosity, I often wonder what on earth Israel and other countries that supported this invasion think was going to happen? Did they really think that anyone would willingly give up their land and leave? It should not be a surprise to anyone that when you steal something from them, they're not going to be happy about it. Simple.",

In 1948 a treaty was signed that would have formed the nations of both Israel and Palestine. The Palestinians refused to sign the treaty and instead declared war on newly formed Israel. Israel defeated them and annexed the unclaimed land. Had the Palestinians simply signed the treaty then they would have had a<b>  nation</b>. But they didn't. This means that Israel has the legal right to exist. \n\nNow while you seem to be aware of the Christian prophecy, you seem to be unaware that the Qur'an (chapter 17:100 - 104) states that Israel is the land of the Israelites and that they are to dwell safely there until the Islamic End of Days. Which means it is actually anti-Islamic to claim that the territory belongs to the Palestinians. For taking the land away from the Israelites would mean that Allah did not fulfill His promise to the Israelites.",

                    "commentText": "You may not know this yet but it is the JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ETHIC that unites ALL good Americans. Many, many atheists have laid down their lives to protect it. In fact, many of the best defenders of the Christ mission have no interest in participating in the Christian faith. Certainly the holocaust survivors and their descendants continue to defend the ethic. Read on to understand the great principle that has made the United States of America exceptional above all others:\n\r________________________\r\r\nWhile a <b> nation </b>that separates church and state can function, a<b>  nation</b> that rejects basic Judeo-Christian principles is destined to devolve int<b> o banan</b>a republicanism. There certainly were deists among our Christian forefathers but they too embraced biblical morality because they understood it to be the highest of human aspirations.\r\rThese are the 'Christian' principles that made th<b> is nati</b>on 'exceptional', protected us from corruptive practices and gave us the hope of LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL for many generations. You would do well to know and value them: \r\r\n\nYe shall do no unrighteousness in judgment:  THOU SHALT NOT RESPECT THE PERSON OF THE POOR, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour. Leviticus 19:15 \r\r\n\nYe shall have ONE MANNER OF LAW, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God. Leviticus 24:22 \r\r\n\nThe end of our republic must begin with the fracturing of its SOCIAL CONTRACT, the ONE LAW for ALL unifying principle. Why is that? Because when the laws become skewed to place the most amoral, the least talented and the least trustworthy personalities ahead of the more deserving the problem is that these people are simply not equipped to preserve the system of equality that better men and women fought, bled and died to give us.\n\n\r\rA system of MERITOCRACY is the hallmark of a functioning republic.  Ours was intended to b<b> e a nat</b>ion grounded in the vision of EQUAL OPPORTUNITY for EVERY CITIZEN. Of course, we have been an admittedly unperfected work in progress for generations but, nevertheless, this vision has been humanity's greatest pride. Today it is being threatened with the secular vision of MATERIAL equity for all regardless of social contribution. This is the first step towards the return to a <b> Dark</b> Age tyranny that limits the hope of individual aspiration and allows the marginal access to positions of authority. \r\r\n\nRemember this, human glory has always been the gift of a very talented few forging the way for the masses to benefit. The<b> re is no</b>thing wrong with hierarchy as long as each and every human being has the right to express themselves to their fullest potential, that is, until and unless they prevent their neighbor from doing so as well. For this very reason we must have the Judeo-Christian principles in place to protect every one of us. \r\r\n\nWhat we are experiencing today, however, is that an elitist few are demanding the controlled leveling of both mind and speech from the many that they perceive to be beneath them. A situation has been purposefully contrived in which the most morally insightful individuals <b> in our </b>nation are being routinely shouted down by self-pitying, arrogantly amoral masses that are undeservedly attempting to perpetrate a national theft against these well-intentioned people. The forefathers establish<b> ed this</b> nation as a republic to prevent this very situation which they rightly described as 'tyranny of the masses'. \r\r\n\nThe ONLY THING that will save what is left of our republic is the return to the Judeo-Christian principles outlined above. However, don't wor<b> ry, in </b>a nation grounded upon these principles you can still choose to live out your secularism in total peace. While the Islamic god, Allah, demands 'submission' from all of humanity, Judeo-Christianity at its core is about the struggle to preserve the conditions of freedom that allow eac<b> h man </b>and woman to CHOOSE THEIR OWN DESTINY. THAT'S the point.",
