I'm not saying any of this is bad or gross btw, I basically think it's body chemistry slowly changing and breaking down and lifestyle. :3 \n\ntl;dr - They have a distinct smell because of multiple lifestyle and body changes that promote a stronger personal scent.",

Many words we use are contractions of two words and I have no doubt that some time in the future alot will be recognized as a formal and legitimate conjunction of a and lot.
