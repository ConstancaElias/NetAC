        "postText": "Religious fundamentalists have blamed the Belfast Primark fire that destroyed a 233-year-old building on \u2018God\u2019s Wrath\u2019 because the store had a window display in support of Gay Pride.', 'It is not yet known how the fire started in the historic Bank Building in Belfast\u2019s city centre that saw the five-storey structure almost entirely destroyed.', 'But a small number of people on Twitter seem to think support for Pride is to blame, with one quoting the Bible alongside a photo of the rainbow-coloured display, saying \u2018you reap what you sow\u2019.', 'In a now-deleted tweet, Jonathon Eccles wrote: \u2018Primark Belfast up in flames.', '\u2018Galatians 6:& comes to mind\u2026 \u2018Be not deceived: God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\u2019', 'Another person tweeted: \u2018@Primark supported wickedness via it\u2019s shop window a few weeks ago in Belfast.\u2019', 'William Brown wrote on Facebook: \u2018The Almighty God has showed his wrath on Primark store in Belfast which was found ablaze this morning for supporting Gay Pride.', '\u2018Be not deceived, God is not mocked.\u2019', 'He then added: \u2018FOR GOD AND ULSTER.\u2019', 'A fourth said: \u2018Reminds me of our Trinitarian God who burnt not just a shop, but a whole city to a crisp.\u2019', '', 'Earlier this month, on August 4, thousands of people took to the streets in Belfast to celebrate the city\u2019s 25th annual Pride parade \u2013 marching past the iconic Primark building and its LGBT+ window display.', 'The Northern Ireland Humanists group called out the homophobic comments online.', '\u2018This is because Primark had created a rainbow window presentation in support of Pride Belfast this year.', '\u2018We know this is not the feelings of most Christians, but we would ask you, religious or not, to call out this homophobic rhetoric where you find it.', '\u2018We hope those employed by Primark are being helped while out of work. And we also hope the building will be rebuilt as it is one of Belfast\u2019s most beautiful.\u2019', 'On Tuesday 80 fire fighters and 14 vehicles fought to tackle the blaze, clothing nearby offices and seeing shoppers and residents evacuated from the city centre.', 'A 45-metre exclusion zone still remains in place around the building, as fire officers have warned the burnt-out shell could collapse.', 'The store had been undergoing a multi-million pound refurbishment prior to the fire, but the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) were able to stop it from spreading to the new part.', 'NIFRS area commander Aidan Jennings said that structural engineers are working on the scene to establish whether the facade of the building can be saved.', '\u2018There is still a risk it could collapse and that\u2019s why we have the cordons in place,\u2019 he said.', '\u2018At the facade of the building you can see the structural damage and the collapsed and twisted steel but we can\u2019t access that area because of risk of it collapsing.\u2019",

Yep, charming people the christians aren't they? Such a kind, compassionate and inclusive religion. thank goodness <b> nobody </b>was hurt in the blaze, but the fact of the matter is, someone COULD have been. To say its \"good\" that it happened is just flat out psychopathic.",

                    "commentText": "John Wareham organised religion is so easily manipulated and corrupted by man. But didn't Jesus himself have a lot to say about the corruption of the church and about how man should have a relationship without a middleman? Sad so few christians actually acknowledge that. I suppose control and fear is far more useful to those in power, convincing them they HAVE to attend church, HAVE to have a heirarchy and cannot interpret the scriptures themselves. If people did, these priests would be outta jobs right? Religion itself isn't evil, it's organised religion that brings herd control into the mix. Jesus had some pretty decent teachings, but alas, most christians couldn't even tell you them. They're too blinded by their \"masters\".",
