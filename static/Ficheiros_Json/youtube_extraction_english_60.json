And they don't mention how Simba was not a villain, and yet he has to prove himself to be stronger and the only one that could save everyone by having an epic male battle in the end. Hercules, not a villain, but is the Hero and is a an example of the \"perfect man.\" \"Mulan, not a villain, but has to fight the and challenge because the world sees woman as inadequate. People commenting here are just looking at the surface of the movies and not the actual messages that are being portrayed. Anyways, I think you did an amazing job with this video. I found it incredibly informative and I will be sharing it with my colleagues. Thank you.",

And lion king is not about them trying to be the better man and get the woman. Unless you count the musical scar had no interest in Nala and it’s just simba trying to get his rightful place as king. And then Hercules is a god and supposed to be extremely strong. And Mr incredible is a superhero. All your points you brought up lead me to believe you haven’t payed attention to the movies :/",

The very scene you showcase shows strength to be worthless unless combined with smarts and discipline.\n\n2) Beauty and the beast makes a mockery out of traditional masculinity since - as Internalized Misogyni said - Gaston is a vilain. The beast is portrayed as sympathetic not because of his masculine traits/ferocity but because his kindness and empathy, his inner beauty if you will. This is shown (again) in the very scene you showcase, where the beast refuses to fight and we're supposed to show sympathy or  that. \n\nAlso, the beast in his human form is \"not\" traditionally masculine but (true to his inner nature) almost feminine.",

However, for those films that are not adaptations of Shakespear and what not, I wonder how they would be worked differently and still have some memorable effect. Would the films still be beloved​ by people when they grow up? Perhaps Disney is lazy in changing the roles they set forth, also perhaps you can only rework and adaption so much before the story loses​ its focus.",

    "commentText": "The topic covered in this video is really relevant and a true issue in pop culture in general, not just in Disney films. I agree with you that movies, series and other media play a role in theaching boys and girls how they should act, but the examples you used were really unacurate.\n\nAs some other comments pointed Gaston is a villain, so his ways are not portrayed in a heroic or positive way, they are actually made fun of. Belle rejects him, she is a girl that wants to be independent and cultivates personal interests, seeks knowlege and culture from books and has no interest in finding a husband, for she knows she does not need a man to be happy. Acting innacordingly to the tradicional women role in our society makes the peolple from her village see her as strange. And Beast and the Beauty in a tale about interior appearence overcoming the exterior and superficial one (even though the prize in the end is the ugly one becoming phisycally beautiful too, in this topic Shrek's ending is more \"subversive\")",

    "commentText": "So I'm a senior college student and I'm currently taking a gender class because I needed a writing course. My teacher suggested we watched this video for our discussion, this was my response: \n\n\"I can see how masculinity is glorified in these films, but I don't see a reason why it shouldn't be. Mulan could not have played the awesome female hero role if she never toughened up, it's a war movie, and she came out on top. In fact, most of these films are depicting good vs. evil so there has to be dominance somewhere for the films to be realistic. The characters aren't meant to shake hands and get along, these movies are meant to show hardship and the payoff from it. Also, I believe it's a good thing to encourage athleticism among children, so physically attractive characters like Hercules should be seen as motivation to exercise. It's unlikely that most people will resemble a Disney character, so the argument of the ideal look doesn't fully translate, but the body type should be sought in a realistic fashion because obesity should never be encouraged. Good people should be accepted, but unhealthy habits shouldn't be encouraged.\"\n\nYea so that was my response to this. I know it's somewhat repetitive and simple, but it's all I could currently think of saying.",

The whole point of his movie was him learning to be a better person. \n2) Gaston is his movie's villain, but this video acted like he was the hero of his movie.\n3) Of COURSE Mulan quickly learns physical power is important: she joined the army and was expected to FIGHT for her life.\n4) Male lions DO fight in real life for dominance over their Prides (not the trait - the group of lions). \n5) Of course Hercules was chiseled: he's a greek demigod, who was actually extremely buff is his real mythology. \n6) The fight between Jafar and Aladdin, while having a little focus on Jasmine's love, was mainly to save Agrabah, the royal family, and potentially the world. \n\nI understand Sexism, Strength, Dominance, Masculinity, and Feminism is important, especially when critically reviewing movies. However, I feel Disney movies, and Disney as a whole, gets a lot more heat then it rightly deserves, especially when people forget not only when some of these movies were released (some as far back in the '50s), but also the time periods in which they were set.",

Disney films actually end with the whole fight over the women only a couple of times, so i suggest checking the actual facts here! What you are saying is basically reverse sexism. You are saying that its not okay to use masculine men in films. PLENTY of films use skinny men just as much as masculine men. Look at Mulan. What about the big guy saying how he doesn't care what she looks like? Fair enough its about what she cooks like but it isn't that bad. He likes food. No big deal! plenty of people like food. \n\n>_> Rant Over >_>",

I'm against abuse and oppression as well, I think a lot of Disney movies pointed out the flaws in society, and human nature by portraying the negative, or harmful aspects of society through their villains, as we see here.  Gaston isn't exactly the poster child for who they are saying we should be like.  Nor is Syndrome.  In most Disney movies, the \"romance\" was viewed as a partnership, between a man and a woman (again, nothing wrong so far....).  Like Pocahontas, or Mulan?  They were never \"objects\" or \"servants\".  Honestly, I think some people spent so many years in wasted college courses that they feel the need to make up problems so they can psycho-analyse things to death just to give them something to do, to stroke their own egos.",

But sexist and demonstrating to young kids that's the way the world works? If you believe that you're a moron. \n\nGaston for instance...was a bad guy. It was understood that he was a dick...even when I was 4 watching this movie I knew he was and not something I wanted to be.\n\nAnd the argument about Mulan learning that to fit in she had to have strength and physical prowess. Yes. What's your point? It's...a fucking army. They didn't have radar and computers to sit at. You had to be physically strong so that you can pull your weight when it counted.\n\nYour point about violence and dominance? It's....called CONFLICT. It's the premise of all of our media. If characters in movies talked out all of their problems it would be boring. The battle between 2 men for pride and status or the affections of a woman. Your best example was Aladdin? Where the evil guy in the movie was trying TO STEAL the throne Agaba. Pretty sure that Aladdin was trying to stop the guy from doing that in addition to protecting Jasmine. \n\n\nI think what you're doing is conflating classical tropes as very sad evidence of something in society that doesn't exist.  I get your argument about Masculinity in Disney films but what's your point. You seem to be pointing in a very \"Men are this, and women are portrayed oddly\" conclusion. And that this conclusion shapes young boys and girls to be and act a certain way. And none of it is true.",

He's not saying that the films as wholes are presenting those issues, he's just analysing the specific situations. I agree it's a bit of a stretch to say B&tB is sexist bc of Gaston, since he's the villain and all, but I do agree that it's still presenting ideas of hypermasculinity since he's so hypermasculine and he's praised by the townfolk for it. And just so you know, I see sexism everyday. How would you know what I go through on a day-to-day basis? My father is entirely sexist and casual sexism is encouraged in society, snide jokes about women being weaker and even sexism directed towards men, like hypermasculinity for example.

He showed the clip of The Emperor's New Groove where the scene with him examining the girls was intended to be seen as a negative thing, because you see Kuzko(I dunno how to spell his name) grow as a character to stop being a piece of shit and grow to be a kind and just ruler.

He picks a scene where he is being a dick to make some point about learning bad values, when the entire point of that movie is learning to be a kind and gentle ruler. The movie is teaching kids to NOT be line the clip he selected.\n\nHe talks about how men do not show vunerability in Disney movies while using a clip from B&tB where the beast is displaying vunerability and unwillimgness to fight.\nHe talks about body types while using clips from mulan that A) has characters of very different body types, B) he uses a song where the point is that they all have different ideas of what a dream girl is, and C) he uses a movie where the main character is a girl joining the army to protect her father. She is taught strength because she is joining the fucking army. So he failed to make a point about the movie teaching men to be strong, and he disproved his previous point that Disney movies are all about strong men fighting other strong men for power or a woman.\n\nDisney movies show men and women of all body types. the things people fight for range from love, protecting family and friends, or just protecting strangers for the sake of being good. They teach values line compassion, self sacrifice and honesty.\n\nThe only point he isnt straight up bullshiting about is that nearly every movie has a straight love story involved. While that may be true, please explain how it is a problem.\nA) it is the most common form of relationship and thus makes it very relatable for wide audiences, and B) its not like alternative forms of love stories do not get told in media.",

If you actually watched the films, neither Aladdin or Simba were fighting for a woman, pride or status. \n\nJasmine already loved him therefore he wasn't fighting for her love he was fighting to stop Jafar's plan to rule the lands. And Aladdin wished for Genie's freedom instead of princeship(pride and status). \n\nIn the Lion King, Simba did gain pride and status for his action of removing Scar of his tyrant rule over Pride Rock, but gaining back pride and status wasn't the driving force for Simba to challenge Scar. He came back for the sake of his family and friends who were suffering under the tyrant rule.",

They aren't the same!\n\nSimba becoming king was a by product of his action of over throwing Scar from power because someone has to be 'king'. His motivation to take down Scar wasn't because he wanted to become king, it was to free his family and friends and the rest of the animals from Scar's control and bring balance back to the valley. And to free his family and friends and bring back balance, Simba had to return to take his place in the Circle of Life.",

Showing men of different body types and with different personalities (even men that act a bit on the the feminine side) is what we need. If you show the same tired image it will get stuck in the minds of people. I watched so many Disney princess movies and dressed as a princess all the time. I literally got nothing but ponies and dolls for Christmas because I used to think that Barbie was who I was going to be. In fact, I had a dream of becoming a cheerleader with blonde hair, skinny body, and a pretty face. I remember that being what I saw in the media and must have picked up on it. On the other side I have a good friend who watched nothing but \"boy shows\" and she admits to have grown up to be very masculine (which she is). We should show different body types, sexualities, and people who are transgender or gender fluid. That's what society needs to promote being yourself (as long as that doesn't mean you're an ass). In conclusion ya'll need to chill yourselves and stop getting offended by what you think goes against you little \"norms\" (that was long but thanks for reading)",

That's animal nature and not a very good example. Also the buffness factor doesn't work well with the Mulan movies because asian people have a completely different body than someone black, white so on. In fact all races are built differently. If you notice, they way the characters are designed they have a smoother, sleeker, slimmer look to them because asian people are naturally slim built. I'm not saying they can't be muscular or heavy set. But look at the character designs. Guys that wouldn't by any means be considered tough or strong manly men by \"Disney's\" standards of tough. Also, did you forget that all of the Prince Characters, good guys, heroes, guys who gets the girl in the end, whatever you wanna call them, all of them were pretty boys. They are the american version of the bishounen, which translates to \"pretty boy\" or \" beautiful boy\". Do you know how shocked I was when the Beast into that blonde haired blue eyed woman-man? He was such a raging badass all through Beauty and the Beast only to transform into a man whose way prettier then the 'Beauty' of the movie. Like no joke. He completely swaggerjacks Belle in terms of femininity. He was both Beauty and the Beast during the whole damn movie. Not there's anything wrong with that. But my point is really look at all disney films again. Hell, even Hercules. He has a manly body but kind of a pretty face. Disney Male protagonist are usually on the pretty side. Reason being the young female demographic like those boy band types more than over macho types. You have to remember disney movie just shape the way boys think but girls too. Why do you think girls go nuts over the flavor of the month popstars so much. They look like the Prince Charmings and stuff. Your view is way too narrow...",

        "commentText": "Let's also remember that this movie also features a). a very threatening, very powerful female antagonist and b). a mother of two who whoops her ass while several months pregnant.\n\nIn fact, most of these examples come from the comic relief character or the villains, i.e., characters we're not meant to identify with (or, in the case of Kuzco, someone who we want to see learn his lesson).\n\nThe praise of masculinity in Mulan is not the creators talking, it's the characters, and it's important for that expectation to be established so that an un-masculin woman can defy everyone's expectations and prove that anyone is capable of great things.\n\nThe perceived stereotype that an unwillingness to fight means weakness has no validity whatsoever: it's clear in Beauty And The Beast that the Beast's unwillingness to fight makes him superior to the bloodthirsty and violent Gaston. And the only reason Scar doesn't fight is because he actually IS a coward. Think about it: the only time he fights is when he can make the first strike. Any other time he backs down or tries to weasel his way out, like when he tried to pin Mufasa's death on the hyenas. Aladdin was also not fighting Jafaar for Aladdin, he was trying to save the entire city from Jafaar's evil, power-drunken reign. Jafaar is the only one who sees Jasmine as a prize, while Aladdin actually gets her to help him (as in, he sees her as a person who can do things, not a nice thing to look at).\n\nWhile I agree that masculinity is a bit overly-glorified, especially in kid's films, Disney's crimes are arguably not malicious ones, just maybe a little thoughtless. More often than not, DreamWorks films (or, more recently, Illumination Entertainment films) tend to pass of sensitive males as prissy, wimpy and comical to the point of almost being \"no homo\" jokes. If there are any serious examples of over-glorified masculine stereotypes in Disney films, none of them are here. I also realize this thing was made a few years ago, before \"Frozen\" gave us a burly, round-jawed and sensitive love interest with Christophe.",

The whole point is for Mulan to prove she is not an object, and just as worthy as any man. Yet they portrayed the song as if it's the message of the movie. Or the scene from beauty and the beast where the dude is like, trying to screw Bella and shes saying no, and he's like pinning her against the wall and shit; that guy is portrayed as an asshole, you are supposed to be uncomfortable. The whole point is to show girls they don't need to settle with an douche like that, and I'm pretty sure he falls into a bottomless pit at the end or some shit.

Using Gaston, a noted villain, to make a point about how men should act or look is simply stupid. You should have transferred that focus to a character like Hercules, who has a similar body type and isn't supposed to be the bad guy that kids don't want to be like. \n\nUsing Lion King to talk about male characters teaching boys to fight each other for dominance is also ridiculous because they are lions and that is a thing that actually happens in nature with lions and other animals. \n\nUsing the song from Mulan is also a poor choice, as the entire movie follows a woman who proves herself every bit the equal of a man in a military setting. The movie was more clearly targeted to young girls for an audience than boys. I could go on but there isn't much point. You could have a point in there but your examples were poorly chosen.",

    "commentText": "Sorry bud, but half your evidence about men comes from the characters that are the villain of these films, particularly everything you said about Gaston (except about his body type, but even that was used to accentuate his cruelty). Your argument about Hercules, as evidence of Disney lauding strength, is invalid as well since Hercules is an ancient Greek story about a demi-god who's only superpower WAS HIS STRENGTH.\n\nYou also take the song from Mulan out of context. This song serves to inform the child audience of the soldier's current mindset, which sets the stage for the big reveal when the truth about her gender comes to light. And again, later in the film, the audience is shown that their sexist view was wrong.\n\nYour use of Gaston cornering The Beast does not prove your point either. The film, here, shows the vileness of Gaston in contrast to The Beast's growth as a character (who has by this time embraced more positive qualities such as kindness, patience, and caring). Gaston is the cautionary tale, not the aspirational one.\n\nAladdin vs. Jafar - The final battle of every movie is a struggle of the hero and the villain. And since Jasmine was reviled by Jafar, Aladdin was not fighting to win her like a trophy, but to save her from a creep 50 years her senior who was about to force her to become his child-bride and usurp her kingdom. She was also instrumental to their victory.\n\n\nIt was a good try, I hope you got at least a C+ on the assignment.",

When the antagonist appears she outsmarts them with a firework rather than just strength also and I remember a reversal scene near the end of the film were the men dress as women to sneak pass the guards and climb in the temple using Mulan's same technique of climbing the post.",

Take Ariel:she gives up her voice and family to have legs and try to seduce a man that she saw one night on a boat and rescued. About their sexuality: when Ariel asks the sea witch how she can get her prince if she gives up her voice, and Ursula replies: ‘you’ve got your looks, pretty face, and don’t underestimate the power of boy language’.",

SEX is the underlying thing in Disney films that make them dangerous to young influential kids. \"Strength\" isn't a trait that should be viewed with negitivity. \"Dominance\" is something that happens naturally all the time. Two lions fighting for dominance in the pride is a natural thing. \"Sexism\" Disney isnt the cause or main problem for this.",

However, I would also argue that in a fair few Disney films, the context is very much historical (citing Aladdin and Mulan as prime examples). Both of those films are set at a time when it was the accepted thing to treat women in such a way, and, in Mulan's case, to have these standards in place for men. I by no means agree with it, but I think it does need to be considered that historical accuracy is sometimes a factor.",

True masculinity inspires confidence in others and seeks to protect those around him. He leads people for their best interests. \n\nNotice how all the villains lead: someone ends up suffering. Notice how abusive these villains are. They're macho.\n\nto illustrate another way: to extremes on a spectrum would be macho and metrosexual.",

He has a bit of a soft spot for Mulan, but that doesn't seem to detract from the fact that he's a very masculine character. And he's the hero.\n\nJust curious, what makes you define Max as emasculine? He's not physically strong and he's timid. Is that it?",

However, gender roles are something that are introduced to children from a young age and are constantly reinforced through media. Disney is only an example of this effect. We are forced into these blue and pink stereotypes from the second we're born - parents buy boys toy cars and girls barbie dolls. These are merely leftovers from millenniums of gender segregation and it is good to be aware of this.",

They did a nice job of modernizing the morals to fit our time but they can't completely remake the stories to fit our modern sensitivity without completely redoing the plots. But really it's not Disney that created these stereotypes but generations of gender inequality whose stories are still being passed down to children.",

There's a much higher likelihood that these \"climactic scenes\" are more representative of good vs. evil. Isn't that something we should teach our kids - to stand up for what's right?",

In most (if not all) cases, these characters are clear examples of what not to be.  The archetypal \"good guys\" usually cherish and protect their chosen love, and they are selfless in doing so.

He became good, just like that, after kidnapping and abusing her and her father. In real life, the beast would have continued to be a beast. It's a pattern that many domestic abused women are familiar with; thinking they can \"change\" the guy, and if they can, they are at fault for being beaten.",

Women don't want soft men who buy flowers and are submissive/passive. Nice guys don't get laid. Disney represents reality.",

Also, the reason you don't see many dead female soldiers is they only make up 20% of our military and they're mostly in the air force. How do you know women don't sacrifice as much as men?",

The only people he had to talk to were his servants, who have to obey him, so of course he's stubborn, selfish, and socially awkward, but that's not cruel. He wasn't able to change until the people around him did.  Also, I have thoroughly enjoyed this discussion.",

Little Mermaid is the best example: change yourself to please a man. But  Mulan breaks the gender barrier that told women that they were too weak to defend their loved ones in war which is empowering. :)",

You talk about sexism against woman, but you choose two strong, independent women (Mulan and Belle) as your examples? You talk about the ideal of masculinity, but choose a villian (and clear ass) like Gaston? And yes, most climax with a fight. But that's because it makes for a good story. MOST stories period end like that. And then you chose Lion King, where the 2nd climax is higlighted by a distinct lack of fighting",

In order for people to portray women the way the video poster wants, it would be historically inaccurate. \"A girl worth fighting for\" is meant to portray the mindset of military men - specifically, in ancient China. What the video poster is asking for is unrealistic portrayals of people in particular contexts.\n\nAnd the entire point of the training montage in Mulan, is that it wasn't her brute strength, but her ingenuity that helped her prevail.",

If we think that being courageous and being honest then yes. We need courageous men to tell the honest truth like we went to war for nothing and were killing innocent people. Not like fuck it, ill be a hero and kill people i dont know because the tv told me i would be respected automatically and chicks would love me if i joined the army.... get it ?",

Yes, Quasi was not the a-typical male, however he is yet, another male hero.\nAlso, Jasmine was still portrayed as a female whom needs a male to save her...even though it wasn't via brute/strength, the message is she needs a 'smart' male to save her.\nAs far as Chaston chastizing Beast, well the bad thing is that he is belittling him so to speak, for not being 'man enough'.",

Even to this day that is how training in the army is conducted in order to get the men into the physical shape that they are required to maintain.",

It's just saying you don't have to be super good looking to love and be loved. Your case is 90% empty aside from the 'caring what she cooks like' line, which is somewhat sexist.",

Why couldn't mulan 'become a man' through intelligence or other attributes other than being able to go toe to toe with the physical tasks the others were doing?

It's about where you say something about muscles and heroic people and body types. It makes sense that herc has muscles because he's super strong and he's good-looking because he's supposed to be god-like. It wouldn't make any sense if a skinny, average looking guy without muscles did everything Herc did. It also makes a boundary between fantasy and the real world.",

Gaston, for instance - the whole point is that he is MEANT to be a chauvanistic pig, which is why Belle turns him down and ends up with Beast instead. The fact he's so buff indicates how image-obsessed and shallow his character is. As for Hercules - well, he's meant to be the strongest guy on the planet, did you think Disney was going to make him skinny?",

I would add one thing though, regarding Beauty and the Beast: if there's a problem with the portrayal of masculinity, it's the perpetuation of the popular myth that a strong, extroverted male is necessarilly oafish, petty and tyrannical, e.g. Gaston.  Mulan almost seems to continue in this vein, reducing male virtue to mere physical strength.  What, then, is a young man supposed to infer from all this?",

When you point out negative characteristics of the antagonists, I have to say the filmmakers agree with you and are portraying that as undesirable. Mulan is an attempt at incorporating feminism into a Disney movie by portraying a girl in opposition to a misogynistic culture. Even though it's questionable how well they did, you can't point at the depiction of misogyny and say \"look, misogyny!\" Of course it's misogyny. Is it femnst in contxt?",

Emperor's new groove, Aladdin, and (since it's talking about Disney in general) toy story and up, the list goes on to contradict just this ONE point.  \n\nMost Disney themes contradicts what this video is saying.",

What i will point out that the those of comical relief in Disney movies do not have the body type you portray. Take the Gennie from Aladdin. He's less than attractive. By that, i say you're begging the question in this, by only pointing that boys would want to play the hero instead of the sidekick. Also, Mulan's training turned her into a soldier, where you're either tough or dead, masculine defined or not",

However some Disney women do rescue men - Mulan fought in a war, for example, and Ariel had to lift Eric to the surface to save him. You should really look beyond just what you see with your eyes - that is, after all, the moral of the story of Beauty and the Beast.",

So yes, Disney is portraying an idealized male appearance, just as it does with female characters.

Teach the children real life; tough but worth it, sometimes questionable, and a \"man's world\", a world made chiefly by men - feminists help me out here",

This natural strength enabled them to hit harder and faster then women with the weapons available for warfare. Also, women, especially in China, were not raised to fight in that time. So yeah...",

Female characters are always very feministic, male characters sensitive. The violent and dominant characters are usually the bad guys who die at the end. \r\nThe opposite of what you argue",

We do not want to be seen as having to stay home and look after the kids and men shouldn't have to be ostracised because they are. The fact is we don't live in an equal society women have not got the high paid jobs or positions of power and its not due to the lack of want or skill.",

He's the villain in the movie, and kids are taught from a young age that the villain is bad and you should hate him, so it looks to me at least that Disney is casting that stereotype in a negative light.  And Hercules may be muscular, (like he is in Greek Myth) but in the movie he's a bit of dork, taking away from that macho image.",

They simply reflect the view that has been bred down through socioevolution.\n\nAwesome to see an intelligent video btw.",

You do not see one single porker as the heroin. \n\nUsing Mulan as an example of masculinity is just stupid. Hello, it is the army, people fighting? You sort of have to be physically strong to join.

That aint sexist. There is nothing wrong with strong men with a lot of muscle. They are usually healthyer and more attractive to women. They are natural candidates for a visual medium of a movie. There was also complete voidance of specific context. Gaston was the BAD GUY who was not an admirable peson. Sanjay, you're off.",

But it's also an over stereotyping of biological predispositions.\nIt's very complex, has a strong foundation and it's well-fortified.",

Using caricatures of males, such as Gaston, was not a good way to defend your view. Such characters are designed to be disliked. Also, certain examples, such as Mulan, actually contradict your view. What was Mulan really trying to say about women and gender roles?",

Of course they'd emphasize masculinity - one, it's a military montage, and two, it makes Mulan's rise to the top that much better.

Aladdin was a scrawny, street rat who fell in love with a princess who fell in love with him because of his personality. Mulan was in the freaking military- where masculinity is supposed to be emphasized. It was her mind that Shang fell for.",

If anything Disney movies empower women. Gaston is the VILLIAN not someone to look up to. Besides the Disney team is a team of artists, at least w/ the classics. They took fairy tales and brought them to life through art and hard work. The movies taugh GOOD messages. in hercules during that song they say \"And the nicest guy,Not conceited\"",

XD lol it varies from major stereotypes to simple ones, it's basically the icon thought of the subject which is why we have trivia questions like:\r\nDid you know cats aren't suppose to drink milk?\r\nDid you know cats don't eat mice but see them as toys of huntign training?\r\nDid you know that bats don't have wings?",

In her case she's in the army where even nowadays everyone has to make a certain cut or they would never survive out on the field. Besides its says in the lyrics being swift as the coursing river and with the strength of a raging fire these don't necessarily suggest PHYSICAL strength but more mental strength. Think of Chinese proverbs you can get that often use nature as examples",

I think this is really someone picking out all little details that i really think just go over kids heads and its the adults who take things to be more than they are.",

The use of Gaston and Beauty and the Beast in general was bad since Gaston was never meant to be portrayed as what boys should strive for, as Beast won out in the end.  Hercules is part God and has the strength to go along with it, not even a Disney creation, but something almost as old as the written word.  Disney exaggerated to go with a 'Greek' style.  Perhaps more examples.",

Second of all, I think men (and everyone else) SHOULD strive for a nice body, because it's healthy to be in shape. Personally I like the muscly guys anyway. I'm not the only one. XD",

For example in Mulan even thought they tried to make her as tough as a man and paint the image in her head that men are supposed to be like great typhoons ect she overcame those barriers becoming like the top warrior in the army therefore proving some of your theory wrong. Also with the Lion King clip technically your wrong there to because in the animal kingdom males rule. And in lion prides 2 males will fight over land, mates ect.",

Gaston's excessive chauvinism and traditional masculinity is a clear message of 'what not to be' (a rarity in Disney); Mulan is satirizing traditional gender roles throughout. Disney's portrayal of masculinity is flawed, but B & the Beast and Mulan are poor examples for this argument.",

The examples, especially Gaston and the Emperor, are highly debatable as \"Ideals\", considering Gaston is the villain, and the Emperor a buffoon. Their portrayal of masculinity in their films is not ubiquitous, but their portrayals of women as objects or servants are far more uniform.",

This guy who did this shitmentary is just a mangina douche who doesn't believe women should be responsible",

    "commentText": "I hate to say it, but Beauty and the Beast was just a terrible example. The movie literally focuses on reconsidering the roles of strength and beauty. The princess in mosty Disney films is indeed an object; in fact, in most hero's journey stories in general the lady is purely a reward or quest. But Beauty and the Beast just can't be evaluated in this way. And while it is true that Gaston essentially defined masculinity for much of the movie, ultimately he was defeated and the Beast got the girl.",

Many are set in different times/cultures, and so different rules apply.

Maybe it used to be that way, but reading too much into these movies is just stupid. They are meant to entertain and nothing more. You want your kids to learn equality teach them by example.

Climactic battles at the end of Disney movies aren't about dominance, they're about the hero righting the wrongs caused by the villain. It's just that the only way to do that is with violence, and, since we are a violent race, that's the way to solve the problem. Go to any movie aimed at men, and you will see a climactic dual at the very end. I can almost guarantee it.",

There hasn't been a homosexual relationship depicted and even Quasimodo doesn't get the girl in the end.  I think he missed the lessons of compassion, but it does seem like only the good looking fighters win.",

Mulan was based on a WAR! do u think men could afford to be sweet, and sensitive when they're preparong to kill each other? As for the sexism, Disney has shown many women taking charge of their fates, and becoming stronger people, and has been doing it more often now adays.",

The point of Gaston being a buffoonish villain, and the \"Girl Worth Gighting For\" and bride selection scenes being parody have already been mentioned. What I don't think has is Mulan's learning strength and physical prowess. First, you're knocking a movie with a fairly feministic stance, which is ironic. Second, it's my understanding that strength and physical prowess are necessary in the army. I'm all for breaking barriers, but please do the research.",

You do not get it. The cultures represented within are accurate, especially that of the Lion King. We are talking about LIONS. Note that the females are also presented as resourceful, adventurous, successful, valued, and capable of making decisions. Also note that in Beauty and the Beast, the Beast is the HERO and not the VILLAIN.",

Take mulan for example, the whole movie was about a female hero trying to fit in with the men in a time which women were percieved inferior.\n\nAnd a goal of strength and dominance is a great thing for any boy... its when its not encouraged and they find themselves weak and inferior around other boys, that causes low self esteem.",

Women dont produce hormones such as testosterone, so they are not aggressive, strong, or as protective of their pride and dignity.  This isnt sexism, but the general stereotype of most males and how they act.  These are merely extremes shown in Disney.  Men are afraid of intimidation while Women are afraid of Separation",

Disney films are films for kids, they won't even give to much of a fuck if the girl is a damesel in distress or if she's an hero.. please get this shit taken down, its utter rubbish",

Kids don't run around saying \"I want to be like Gaston\" and yet you seem to think Disney placed him on some sort of pedestal as the pinnacle of masculinity.  He's the bad guy. Kuzco is portrayed as immature and cruel in the beginning of that film, and the story arc is him overcoming that personality - realizing its a cold, lonely path.",

Many of the clips were movies where the bad guys were the ones who were overly aggressive and disrespectful toward women. The Mulan example was satirizing the view that women need to only be pretty and cook. Further, the female characters I grew up watching (Ariel and Belle) were extremely independent and questioned their role in society. I can see the point, but it seemed too generalized and overreaching to me.",

Every woman, on the inside deep down, needs a man who will protect and love her with all his heart... It is her truest desire..Cept for lesbians, which are fine. :)",

He himself lays down his life as a sacrifice to free Meg, and what kind of macho man lays down his life for a so called \"object of pleasure or servant\"?",

When people hate who they are, there is a serious problem, a problem that calls for higher standards of moral and ethical behavior. Yes, we have the highest rates of suicide ever. We also have the most preasure put on religion at any point in history. So yes, things must change, but we must change them wisely, not recklessly.",

How is it we have a functional culture and media if everything is just everyone's perceptions? These images \"seem\" to make sense because they reflect cultural ideas about gender that we are all familiar with and shown on a daily basis.",

I'm sure you have.\nThe beast learns to be kind and caring in the end.\nHercules gives up being one of the Gods to stay with the woman he loves.\nSimba didn't want to fight but was forced to to defend himself from Scar.\nThe movie Mulan teaches that women don't have to be the stereotypical woman and that they can do anything men can do if they work hard enough.",

As has been said before, a lot of the characters this clip is criticizing are the EVIL characters, and therefore not desirable. If this is not the case, they often have an epiphany midway to change their destructive personality (such as in Emperor's New Groove).",

However, you don't touch on the situations where the stereotypes are given to an 'evil' character.  For example, you show the Emperor's new groove scene where Kuzco is objectifying his potential wives.  However, Kuzco is shown in a very negative light at that point of the movie.  Much of his negative dominating attitude is lost over the course of the movie.",
