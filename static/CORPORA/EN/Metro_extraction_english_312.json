        "postText": "When I saw that PureGym had asked a trans woman to leave the women\u2019s changing room, I wasn\u2019t surprised. Prejudice still has a far greater impact on society than we like to think it does.', 'The story reminded me of my own experiences when I came out as a girl at secondary school.', 'I wasn\u2019t called by my name or pronouns, and I wasn\u2019t allowed to use the girls\u2019 toilets or changing rooms. Back then, I was shut out from sports by my school and now I am shut out by outdated bigotry, particularly aimed at trans women.', 'It\u2019s comforting to assume that the vast majority of transphobia happens in faraway places like America, but the reality is that it\u2019s just as common here in a country as inclusive as the UK.', 'In fact, the same arguments we see now directed against trans people were not that long ago being used to attack lesbians and gay men. There are lots of accounts from the 80s of lesbians being told they aren\u2019t real women and being excluded from such spaces.', 'As recently as this year, there were stories of butch women being made to feel unwelcome in women\u2019s spaces, highlighted in a video by the LGBT organisation, Stonewall. Trans women may be at the centre of this argument, but it absolutely still applies to the cis lesbian and gay communities as well.', 'It\u2019s easy to see the parallels between then and now, and to conclude that we haven\u2019t progressed very far at all.', 'As with my school, I feel the appropriate response here would be to lawyer up and sue PureGym \u2013 but this isn\u2019t an easy or cheap thing to do, and does very little to temper the feelings of unwelcome that the company has created.', 'It\u2019s also worth acknowledging that the very kind of trans woman this would impact is the kind least likely to be able to afford this type of legal process or to find an accepting alternative.', 'It often confirms internal biases that maybe we are wrong and, when we are removed, a problem that\u2019s fixed.', 'This is absolutely a class issue.', 'The more you look like society\u2019s idea of an acceptable or conforming man or woman, the more likely you are to be able to fully use spaces like gyms.', 'But to achieve this requires money for things like facial surgery or to skip the ever-growing lines for transgender treatments, such as hormones, by going to a private doctor.', 'It wasn\u2019t until very recently that I felt comfortable getting involved in sports at all. I feel lucky that my current university has sports teams and areas for \u2018womxn\u2019 \u2013 an inclusive term created by radical feminists, which signals that any kind of woman is welcome and can participate fully.', 'We also have events around campaigns like \u2018This Girl Can\u2019 \u2013 which promotes the message that women and girls should work out, irregardless of body type, and in an environment free of judgement.', 'PureGym advertises under the slogan of \u2018everybody welcome\u2019 but it\u2019s easy to see how the company could learn a lot from places like my university, as well as the wider female sports movement, who are truly aiming to deliver for everyone.', 'The many women (and that includes trans women) who face prejudice, misogyny and violence every day will never have the rights and the spaces that we deserve unless we stand together against the few who would like to exclude us.', 'This is just a small part of a greater need to encourage all kinds of girls and women to get physically active, and to feel welcome engaging in sports. But, for now, it\u2019s clear that contrary to its mission statement, PureGym is part of the problem, not the solution.', 'It\u2019s sad to think that I could be valued less as a customer to a company like PureGym, and sad to think that instead of challenging transphobia, it\u2019s easier to just remove the trans people.', 'It often confirms internal biases that maybe we are wrong and, when we are removed, a problem that\u2019s fixed.', 'I\u2019m grateful I don\u2019t fall into this category \u2013 but maybe I would, if I ever found myself in a similar situation to the poor trans woman who was asked to leave.', 'My heart goes out to her, and my hope is that one day we can live in a world where such problems don\u2019t exist; one where if a bigot has a problem with us because of how we look, they are asked to leave \u2013 not us.', 'Pure Gym were approached for a comment and a spokesperson told Metro.co.uk: \u2018PureGym\u2019s mission is to make fitness accessible to all and \u2018Everybody Welcome\u2019 is at the heart of everything we do. That core principle underpins our clear guidance to staff when supporting transgender access, which is itself based on industry guidelines.', '\u2018In addition to male and female changing rooms, our gyms offer separate changing facilities and we support members to use the changing facilities that are best for them and take into consideration other members. PureGym has a zero tolerance policy on any transphobic behaviour from staff or other members.\u2019",

I have no sympathy here. If you were to say <b> doctors </b>are refusing to see you because of whatever uiu wish to call yourself you'd have my full support. if you were to say you were being beaten up or abused you'd have my full support. but if you are not being served by a cafe then go elsewhere.",

This is genuinely appalling, disturbing stuff. The gym offers unisex changing cubicles- if they didn't do this, then I would understand the problem. Trans people who refuse to use these private cublicles when they are provided are deliberately trying to violate women's boundaries to provoke a reaction. This is unacceptable, and I hope that more people will begin to stand up and call out this nonsense.",

The person was 12 in the report I saw (I had to check that one).A person's outlook on the world prior to and after puberty can be significantly different and I believe by not allowing the person to complete the natural hormonal growth at least up until<b>  the</b> age of consent is robbing them of a journey of self discovery which may lead them into different ways of thinking about themselves.",
