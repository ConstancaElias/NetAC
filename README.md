# NetAC (NetLang Analyzer and Classifier)

NetAC is a statistical framework, built in the context of NetLang Project, to study **prejudice discourse** aiming at individual or group discrimination. Given a categorization table the tools included in NetAC search for frequency of occurrence of the keywords in each category and, based on the greatest frequency, propose a classification for each comment and for the overall text. Besides the main classifier, other features are included.
