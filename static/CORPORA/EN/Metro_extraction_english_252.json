        "postText": "If you were to walk past me in the street as I hold my girlfriend\u2019s hand, my label would not be obvious to you.', 'It\u2019s for this reason that bisexual men like myself often have a hard time convincing the world we exist at all.', 'The path to discovering you\u2019re bisexual is a tricky one and it can take years to fully understand. For me, it wasn\u2019t until I reached the age of 19 that I realised I liked men.', 'Speaking to gay friends, they tell me that most of them knew they were gay from a young age; the other boys talked about the girls they liked and they realised they didn\u2019t feel the same.', 'For a bisexual like myself, I did like girls growing up so never saw myself as different sexually. It wasn\u2019t until adulthood that I realised there had been boys at school I thought were hot, but at the time I\u2019d just thought they were cool and wanted to be like them.', 'To discover you like men at 19 is confusing. The first thought you have is \u2018I\u2019m gay.\u2019 Then, as soon as you start to come to terms with this realisation, you think, \u2018wait but I keep seeing hot girls everywhere.\u2019', 'Eventually you realise you are a textbook bisexual, but it doesn\u2019t stop there.', 'A bisexual cannot just announce themselves as bisexual without an endless list of questions from those around them.', '\u2018Do you prefer one or the other?\u2019', '\u2018How many women have you slept with compared to men?\u2019', '\u2018Do you have romantic feelings for women but sexual feelings for men?\u2019', '\u2018Do you think one person will ever be enough for you?', '\u2018Are you sure you\u2019re not just gay?\u2019', 'Sadly, there doesn\u2019t appear to have been many bi men in history that have forced society to take our sexuality seriously.', '\u2018Bisexual\u2019 has been a label so few men have been happy to declare they belong to publicly. And it\u2019s fallen on the shoulders of bi men like myself to clear up the misconceptions.', 'For me, that\u2019s why my label is so important \u2013 I\u2019m a bisexual and shouldn\u2019t need to explain myself any more than that.', 'All people need to know is that I\u2019m not monosexual. If I choose to tell them more than that then it\u2019s my choice.', 'Strangely, the two groups that have the biggest issues with bisexual men are straight women and gay men \u2013 a sad twist of fate considering they are who my sexuality makes me attracted to.', 'Women usually come out with, \u2018I could never date a bisexual, I\u2019m too jealous and would be worried you\u2019d cheat.\u2019 Because for some reason it\u2019s okay to say that my sexuality means I\u2019m a cheater.', 'Gay men will usually tell me that I\u2019m actually gay.', 'I\u2019ve never understood how someone thinks they know more about what turns me on than I do, but that is the world I live in.', 'In spite of all this, I wear my bisexuality as a badge of honour.', 'It\u2019s part of me, something I can\u2019t change and more importantly, don\u2019t want to change.', 'It\u2019s really not a negative thing, I get to see the world from a unique perspective. I\u2019ve dated men, dated women; had sex with men and women.', 'My life is fun and I enjoy it now that I\u2019ve learned to embrace it.', 'Honing something that for so many men is a source of shame and making it work for me is a transferable skill, one that\u2019s given me so much confidence in my life.', 'Hopefully one day more bi men will feel the same and stand together behind the bisexual label.', 'It worries me that something I\u2019ve come to see as a strength is a source of great shame and a secret for the majority of men like me.', 'I want to go to bisexual bars and talk to other men like myself, share our experience of dating men and women and trade the best comebacks to people calling us confused or greedy.', 'I want to have friends who have first-hand experience of bisexuality.', 'I\u2019m a bisexual man \u2013 and it\u2019s awesome.",

            "commentText": "With respect to sexuality, honour has traditionally been associated with (or identical to) \"chastity\" or \"virginity\", or in the case of married men and women, \"fidelity\". Some have argued that honour should be seen more as a rhetoric, or set of possible actions, than as a code.I found this on a website and do not know what it means but neither do I know what wearing a badge of honour as a bisexual means. He looks rather lonely to me in the photos considering he has a choice of him or her. Maybe he should make a choice, front or rear.",
