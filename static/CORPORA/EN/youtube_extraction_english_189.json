Maddy says she has it coming from the opposite direction - people attack her online articles based on her youth, saying she lacks the experience to speak on certain subjects.

When people commented on her lack of experience, first thing that came to her mind was discrimination based on her <b> age </b>and<b>  gender</b>, though it was obvious from the beginning that they're right <b> - nobod</b>y cares about your opinion when you're 20. So maybe TYT should cover this issue: that some people are too eager to cry \"discrimination\" when someone dares to disagree with them. Cause in this case - this issue is very apparent.",
