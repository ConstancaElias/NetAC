        "postText": "'Jeremy Corbyn continued on the intensive campaign trail in Telford on Wednesday, and told supporters in Telford young people should not be forced to forget about council housing. The Labour Party warned youngsters should not have to make their own way in the world. Mr Corbyn told the crowd: It is time we started building a country fit for the next generation where young people don\u2019t fear the future but look forward with confidence.', 'Think of the young people who are given the subliminal message to look after your own education and look after your own health, forget about council housing, make your own way in the world.', 'It\u2019s depressing, it\u2019s unnecessary and it\u2019s all part of the contraction of the public realm and the public state.', 'It\u2019s within our grasp to do something different in this election, and that\u2019s what we are absolutely determined to achieve.', 'But the ambitious plan from the Labour leader has been brutally torn apart by Express.co.uk readers in our latest poll.', 'You were asked: Is Jeremy Corbyn right that all young people should be entitled to a council house?', 'Readers unanimously voted against the idea in the poll, which ran from 2.30pm until 10pm on Thursday November 7 and saw a total of 8,671 votes cast.', 'A massive 91.7 percent (7,954 readers) voted no as part of an angry backlash against the possibility of youngsters being handed a council house.', 'Just 7.3 percent (631 readers) think they should be entitled to one, while one percent (86 readers) opted for the don\u2019t know option.', 'Express.co.uk readers launched a furious attack against the idea, raging it would have catastrophic consequences for the UK economy and country as a whole.', 'One said: \u201cHanding out free houses will cause a huge housing crisis and the civil unrest that comes with it.', 'This in turn will allow John McDonnell - the real brains behind comrade Corbyn - to declare that capitalism is not working, and use this as an excuse to dismantle capitalism and force communism on us all.', 'This will be done at the point of a gun.', 'Other Express.co.uk readers vented their fury at the possibility of having to pay for this, and raged why youngsters today should be handed a free council house when they have worked all of their lives to desperately keep a roof over they head.', 'One said: There was a time in my life when I badly needed the help of the local council (Coventry) - I put my name down for council housing as I did not have a roof over my head.', 'I am still waiting to hear from them several decades later (my friends came to the rescue).', 'In the meantime, I worked my socks off on times covering three jobs which has meant that I have paid for my own home.', 'So for Corbyn to provide housing for all and sundry, I say, not at my expense.', 'Another commented: I\u2019 m a struggling self employed 40 - year - old and I've never been able to afford a house, but where's my free house ? , 'Why shouldn't I get one because I wasn't born at a certain date ? That's ageism.', ' Others accused the Labour leader of saying absolutely anything just to gain vital votes from youngsters in the general election. ', 'One reader said : He is saying absolutely anything to get a youth vote.', 'We already have several generations who want life to gift them everything whilst they have a laugh.', 'Another said: He is desperately trying to appeal to the younger and unfortunately naive voter who will fall for these empty promises.', 'Anyone who is older and wiser will see this just doesn't stack up.'",

The number of major and minor conflicts that have flared up over the years based on this assumption cannot be counted. \u00a0It is one thing to provide for those who can't do so for themselves it is quite another to attempt to do so for everyone. The vast majority who own their own homes have struggled and sacrificed for many years in order to do so.These are ultimately the people who will end up paying for this policy.I think it more than likely they will very quickly become seperated from their hard earned gains at which time not only will the whole thing becomes unsustainable but there will now be another significant percentage of the population in real need of the scheme in order to survive. Would it not make far more sense to teach young people a few basic life skills while they are still at school such as money management.This might just enable many of them to become reliably independent after they leave full time education.It might also provide some practical guidance when choosing a career path knowing the salary required to follow the lifestyle they intend to embrace.I am to be honest horrified when I hear stories of the number of people leaving full time education without even the basic skills to change a light bulb.",

It should have been stopped decades ago and not one of them should ever have been entitled to council accommodation. When Thatcher allowed tenants to buy their council properties that reduced the housing stock significantly.Had the money from those sales gone into home - building programmes we wouldn 't be where we are now.  Native Britons should ALWAYS be given priority for any available social/affordable housing stock.  Anyone else should not be here unless they can fund their own accommodation and pay their own way entirely.",
