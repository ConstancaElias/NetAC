        "postText": "A school catering for children with special needs has been forced to apologise after asking for a \u2018white British\u2019 taxi driver to transport pupils.', 'Highfield School in Ossett, West Yorkshire sent the request to a Castleford taxi company to set up a regular service for one of its students.', 'The email read: \u2018Unfortunately our student will not tolerate anybody who is not white British, therefore to safeguard your drivers please could you always send a white British driver.\u2019', 'Taxi drivers at the company \u2013 who asked not to be named \u2013 were \u2018shocked\u2019 at the request which they said was \u2018borderline racist\u2019 and insensitive.', 'A spokesman for the firm said: \u2018When I received that letter I was shocked because it came from a school where they are supposed to be teaching about equality and diversity and that\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to be teaching the next generation.', '\u2018If you allow this request to be made by the pupil or the parent you\u2019re not promoting that.', '\u2018It\u2019s racist and we\u2019ve never had a request like this before.\u2019', 'Wajid Ali, co-chair of Wakefield District Private Hire and Hackney Association, said a meeting was held with its 500 members who were \u2018all very upset\u2019 over the request.', 'Ali said: \u2018We can\u2019t believe a public body has the audacity to send a letter like this.', '\u2018We\u2019re all really upset about it. It goes against the Race Relations Act 2000 which encourages public bodies not to discriminate against any group. The school should have had this policy in place.', '\u2018We have had people say to us \u201cwhat about the pupil\u2019s complex needs?\u201d but a child under 16 would not be able to make that decision. This was a decision taken by the school.\u2019', 'Ali added that in his 14 years as a taxi driver, this is the first time anything like this has happened and feels they have been discriminated against.', 'He said: \u2018We consider ourselves as professional taxi drivers and certainly I would never judge my customers on their ethnicity.', '\u2018We treat everybody equally and in this case the school has not treated the drivers equally.', '\u2018It\u2019s borderline racist. Race and colour should not come into it. We live in a multicultural society that promotes diversity.', '\u2018We were born in this country and we\u2019re just people trying to provide a paying service and look after our families.\u2019', 'Peter Marshall, executive headteacher of Highfield School, said: \u2018We fully acknowledge that the email sent by the school was wholly inappropriate and we apologise for any offence that was caused.', '\u2018Our priority is to support our pupils, many of whom have extremely challenging and complex needs.', '\u2018Over 180 children from our school community use minibuses and taxis to enable them to access the highly specialised teaching and care we are able to provide for them. We very much value and appreciate the service that all taxi companies and their drivers provide.', '\u2018We have contacted the taxi company to apologise and explain the challenges and needs faced by the pupil the request related to.\u2019",

Not sure what the good solution in such a situation would be so that everyone is happy :(",

Italian, Spanish and Greek antecedents are indeed from Arab regions, hence the dark complexion, dark hair and relative  rarity of blue eyes in those countries.Even the French tend toward more swarthy skin and dark eyes and hair. It would be far more responsible to talk with the child and ascertain the cause of their difficulty regarding skin colour; for the sake of that child's future, they will often have <b> doctors </b>or nursing/teaching/carers who are not of traditional white British backgrounds; far more responsible to get to the bottom of their problem.",
