        "postText": "I recently wrote a satirical self-help book called Think Like A White Man, which talks about what it\u2019s like to be black in Western societies.', 'In it, there is a \u2018formula\u2019 depicting the stark racial disparities at play in how western societies treat crimes around drugs:', 'White skin + drugs = rehabilitation, sympathy, redemption and/or a loving funeral.', 'Black skin + drugs = a cold jail cell, a pillow between your gnashing teeth, absolute unemployability, punchline fodder and, finally, being thrown into an unmarked hole or into the sea.', 'As the old adage goes and as the former justice secretary\u2019s cocaine revelations have conclusively proven: many a true word is spoken in jest.', 'Just this weekend Michael Gove was essentially forced to reveal that he was a user of cocaine 20 years ago while he was a journalist and the reaction has proved my formula right.', 'One day he will no doubt receive a loving funeral in which his cocaine use will not be mentioned or remembered. But in the meantime, he might just receive the keys to Downing Street.', 'Black and poor people can only dream of such treatment.', 'I have never taken or even touched a single narcotic in my life. I have never even smoked a cigarette or shisha. I barely even drink. Yet I\u2019ve been stopped and searched for drugs (or worse) more times than I can remember. I have literally lost count. I have even been in a hard-stop \u2013 when openly armed police storm and scream commands at you \u2013 while returning from a university examination.', 'If I had been stupid, desperate, downbeat or unaware of my environment enough to get involved with drugs, chances are my life would have been ruined. The likelihood is I would today have a criminal record and therefore highly unlikely to make good on any potential I may have.', 'When asked on Andrew Marr\u2019s show yesterday if he should have gone to prison for taking cocaine, Michael Gove responded that he was \u2018fortunate\u2019 not to have gone to prison.', 'Gove wasn\u2019t \u2018fortunate\u2019 not to have gone to prison \u2013 he was fortunate to have been white and middle class. Because if he was not, he almost certainly would have been stopped, searched and eventually caught in possession. And from there on his life would have been ruined.', 'This isn\u2019t an exaggeration. If admitted drug offender Michael Gove was black he\u2019d be nine times more likely to be stopped and searched. If he was caught in possession he wouldn\u2019t be called The Right Honourable Michael Gove today \u2013 he\u2019d be more likely to have a street name like \u2018Sniper Mike\u2019 or \u2018Mike Blow-Ski\u2019.', 'Even when caught with cocaine the racial disparity of charge versus caution is stark: 44 per cent of \u2018Michael Goves\u2019 are charged with possession and 56 per cent are cautioned. Whereas 78 per cent of \u2018Sniper Mikes\u2019 are charged and only 22 per cent are cautioned.', 'Michael Gove is the former justice secretary and therefore a de facto field marshal in the war on drugs. He is now and forever more a poster child for hypocrisy. His tombstone should read: \u2018Journalist, politician, hypocrite \u2013 ultra\u2019.', 'I personally don\u2019t care if Michael Gove took drugs in the past. I wouldn\u2019t really care if I found out he is still shovelling cocaine up his nostrils today, provided it didn\u2019t damage his ability to do his job. I do however care about the war on drugs.', 'The war on drugs has essentially been a war on black and poor people waged predominantly by white middle class people, like Michael Gove and practically everyone running to lead the Tory party (notably other than the two ethnic minority candidates) \u2013 who are actually more likely to use class A drugs, yet highly unlikely to ever be stopped and searched \u2013 and therefore rarely punished.', 'It has left communities \u2013 especially black communities \u2013 dehumanised, stigmatised and criminalised. It has damaged us economically, politically and socially.', 'Of course, prohibition has clearly failed. It has been linked to a boom in criminal gang activity and grooming of vulnerable young people into the trade, a sharp rise in the number of arrests of teenagers for dealing drugs, fuelled mass incarceration in Europe and America and exposes users of drugs to avoidable deaths.', 'So, as we gradually wake up and move towards a more common sense drug policy \u2013 which must include decriminalisation, regulation and rehabilitation \u2013 we must also look at addressing the damage done by the war on drugs.', 'We need to look at \u2018repair-rations\u2019 (correctly known as \u2018reparations\u2019) for the victims of the clearly hypocritical and racist war on drugs.', 'I cannot think of anyone better to lead this movement towards a common sense drug policy than Michael \u2018Mike Blow-Ski\u2019 Gove: the people\u2019s drug offender.', 'Nels Abbey is a media executive, writer and satirist based in London. His first book \u2018Think Like a White Man\u2019 is in all good non-racist book shops and sites now",
