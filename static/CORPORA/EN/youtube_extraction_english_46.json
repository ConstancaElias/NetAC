I would also like to just proclaim out of MY ass that this bitch is incredibly ANTI SEMITIC for not outright supporting Bernie instead of all the other democratic candidates. I mean she had a chance to support the first Jewish nominee, and let's face it, his 'policies are just way more detailed' and are plain and simply better than Elizabeth's.  I mean it's not like this is a democratic society or anything where we get to pick people based on what policies appeal to us more... no no, we need to pick our politicians based on fucking arbitrary things that the candidates cannot change like their fucking <b> gender </b>and/or their religion or some bullshit like that... what'a fucking JOKE MSNBC.

Furthermore, the sexist card is just rubbish. *No candidate*, Warren included, has fought harder and more comprehensively for women's rights over the past 40 years than has Bernie. No-one else even comes close. And lastly, in no way are her policy positions more defined or developed than Bernie's, so that is just another outright fabrication. Warren's motto has become \"I have a plan for that!\" OK. Where are they? And of course, they aren't there, or are merely half-baked, imprecise waffling.\n\nKulinski is right. They should be forced to apologize. MSNBC has outdone Fox at it's own game. It is <b> nothing </b>but weak, shallow, disingenuous corporate bullshit.",

When Bernie ran instead I thought it was a joke and that the DNC were only making a pretense of a primary to nominate Hillary as her opponents were practically nobodies. Then I started listening to Bernie and researching his past and I was ashamed I had not heard of him before (though a lot of that was by design of the corporate media) but once you have your eyes opened it's hard to close them again for the likes of Biden and Warren. Bernie had the substance that Hillary lacked in 2016 and now he still has the substance that Warren lacks in 2020. Since 2016 all I have seen from his opponents is non-policy attacks and pathetic identity politics like this rich girl who's afraid Bernie's taxes might cause her father to have to get a shorter yacht. Bernie 2020 - there is no other option.",

Her parents are billionaires, he wants to tax her inheritance and she most likely sees him as one of those \"greedy jews\" that wants to \"take her money\" . It's probably subconscious, that's why I really don't blame her very much, but she needs to accept her prejudiced worldview. It's a classical case of subconscious deflection, I think she really believes what she said. She probably denies the holocaust too.",

Bernie has a produced an actual healthcare bill, not just a presidential election plan, and he did have a healthcare plan ready to go 4 years ago.  He didn't hobble it together as an afterthought last month.  And he is different from her.  He is to the left or he has the more radical position on nearly every issue, except a few stupid impossible ones. But ignoring all of that, why would anyone go for Bernie when Warren's  policies are almost as radical but she's a <b> woman?</b>  BECAUSE<b>  NOBODY</b> BELIEVES HER!!!!!!",

It's harder for him now that he is running with better competition.  You forget what is popular is often unaffordable.  Tally up all his programs and then tally up all his sources of revenue and I bet there are huge shortages.  Most people are mature enough to see that.",

What people do with their eyes can be a tell. Not everyone is the same but in general when people lie they might look up and to left which is a lot of people do when they're trying to think creatively. They also might look to the right and down (like the lady in the video) which is usually the tell for someone feeling guilty. There are quite a few tells someone displaying just one doesn't neccesarily mean they're lying though. You generally want to look for more than 1 tell",

And no I don't believe necessarily that she dislikes Bernie because he is Jewish. That's why I brought up the fact that she herself is Jewish.. \n As to the idea that Jews in Europe never had last names, you are  probably going back a little too far in history. Anybody living on the European continent wouldn't care about any Royal decree, that would only apply to Great Britain. People of Europe couldn't care less about any kind of royal decree's. \n Almost all European Jews come from Eastern Europe, later Germany, and they very clearly had last names, and that has been the case for several centuries now.",
