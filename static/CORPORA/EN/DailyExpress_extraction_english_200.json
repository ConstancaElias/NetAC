        "postText": "A number of Boris Johnson\u2019s senior aides are set to enter Parliament next month after being selected to stand in Conservative safe seats. Recognisable faces such as Dominic Raab and Rishi Sunak will momentarily swap their advisory roles for the green benches of Parliament.', 'Others thought to almost certainly stand include the Prime Minister\u2019s Brexit adviser, business adviser and political secretary.', 'Yesterday, Andrew Griffith, Mr Johnson\u2019s chief business advisor was selected to fight Arundel and South Downs in the south east, near Luton.', 'Nick Herbert, who has held the seat since 2005, is standing down.', 'At the last election Mr Herbert had a 40 percent majority over Labour.', 'Mr Griffith was chief financial officer and chief operating officer of Sky before he joined Downing Street.', 'We was formerly the Conservative candidate in Corby in the 2001 and 2005 general elections, finishing second both times.', 'The closing days of the Conservative leadership campaign this summer saw Mr Johnson use Mr Griffith\u2019s grade II listed Westminster townhouse to plan his first days in office.', 'Another advisor, James Wild, Mr Johnson\u2019s Brexit aide, was last night selected to fight the seat of North West Norfolk.', 'Here, the Conservatives have a majority of 28 percent, having been held since 2001 by Sir Henry Bellingham.', 'Mr Wild advised Sir Michael Fallon when he was defence secretary and Sir David Lidington when he was Theresa May\u2019s deputy, before then turning his attention to Mr Johnson.', 'Baroness Evans of Bowes Park, his wife, has been leader of the House of Lords since 2016.', 'Then, the Prime Minister\u2019s political secretary, Danny Kruger, was selected to replace Claire Perry to stand in Devizes, a town in central Wiltshire.', 'At the last election Ms Perry had a majority of 42 percent.', 'Mr Kruger previously led negotiations with Labour MPs to back Mr Johnson\u2019s Brexit Deal, and was previously David Cameron\u2019s speechwriter.', 'His mother, Prue Leith, is a judge on the Great British Bake off.', 'Simon Jupp has been selected to replace Sir Hugo Swire in East Devon.', 'In East Surrey, Claire Coutinho stands in the place of Sam Gyimah after he defected to the Liberal Democrats to sit in Kensington.', 'A former adviser to Mr Johnson who has been selected to stand in South Cambridgeshire has faced controversy after being accused by Labour of being \u201cdisgusting racism\u201d.', 'Anthony Browne, in an article for The Spectator in 2002, wrote: \u201cIt is not through letting in terrorists that the government\u2019s policy of mass migration \u2014 especially from the third world \u2014 will claim the most lives. It is through letting in too many germs.\u201d', 'He also wrote that \u201ccurbing the influx of HIV immigrants\u201d would be more effective than tackling HIV by telling people to wear condoms.', 'Mr Browne was formerly a journalist at The Times and The Observer, going on to become a policy director for Mr Johnson when he was mayor of London.',  'When his writings were criticised at the time, he said he had gone through a \u201cphase of being deliberately contrary and deliberately provocative\u201d, adding: I do very much regret any offence caused by any past newspaper articles.', 'It really never was my intention to cause offence, but to provoke debate.', 'The articles, which I deeply regret writing, also don\u2019t give a fair reflection of my views.', 'I want to make clear that I am emphatically not anti-immigration.",

Some personality to make that happen don 't you think ? I can understand why he has done this standing down BP candidates business but he and the tories must realise we BREXITEERS are NOT going to vote for tories who have spent the last THREE YEARS, REJECTING our referendum votes, REJECTING DEMOCRACY, LYING to get elected last GE by pretending to support the tory manifesto to leave and spending the last THREE YEARS trying to STOP BREXIT.They should have been DESELECTED immediately on Boris calling the election. THEN we may have voted for the NEW candidates. Brexiteers voting for those tory remoaner candidates is NOT going to happen. Even the 'personality' of Farage is NOT big enough for that.",
