  \cellcolor{green!27}0:59 Macedonia was never a part of Greece. After the Balkan Wars it was taken by Serbia, later after World War 1 the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (SCS) and after the Karadzordzevic Dictatorship the Kingdom of Yugislavia. During World War 2 Yugoslavia was invaded by the Axis and divided. Macedonia was divided between Germany,Italy and Bulgaria. During the Peoples Liberation War and after Italy and Bulgaria's capitulation/surrender Macedonia declared itself as the Peoples Republic of Macedonia, a communist country and constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY).

  \cellcolor{green!5}Not really acquainted with the first 8, but the last 2 (which are the nrs 1 and 2) are not really an accurate depiction of history. Concerning Cyprus: the Brittish where mostly in command until the end of WWII, at which point they were to be released as a state. After democratic elections Cyprus was to join Greece again, as most Cypriots feel Greek. Turkey, who occupied Cyprus before the English took over, claimed it though (it was also nice to have another reason to hate the Greeks) and invaded, leading to a Brittish-American intervention. The international community then decided to do what none wanted and made Cyprus an independand nation (though the Turkish government still does not accept this). Concerning Yemen: it is/was actually a somewhat democratic country where houti rebels, backed by Iran, try to take over, but at the same time Al Quaida rebels are active in the country with the same aim and it is the latter which Saudi Arabia is supporting. In Syria, Islamic extremists, redily supported by Saudia Arabia, had capitalised on the Arabic Spring revolution to form there country (even surpassing Saudi Arabia's aim to bully Iran, by the aim to spread salafist islam). The initial uprising had little to do with Saudi Arabia as far as I am aware of.  & \cellcolor{green!5}Nation & \cellcolor{green!5}Nationality & \cellcolor{green!5}1/218 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.459 \\  \hline

  \cellcolor{green!5}Gentile vs Hebrew, Muslim vs Infidels, Shia Muslim vs Sunni, Catholics vs Protestant. Notice a pattern? Abrahamic Faiths vs everyone who doesn't believe exactly the same way as they do. Yet these are peaceful religions? All are based on verbal traditions long before anything was ever written. Then they've all used psychological means like claiming  Holy Land given by God . My question is, when did God call all of the masses of the people on earth to let everyone know who was God's authority on the world? Because in all 3, it comes from one person when nobody else is around. If God created the entire universe   long before humans ever existed, if God created everything, then when has God ever needed any human to do God's bidding? In fact, the Abrahamic Faiths caused more prejudices and racism than the Pagan Faiths that they were accusing off. It's only been the last 15 years that women started becoming ministers. All 3 claims that God states that Homosexuality is a sin, but again when did God call all of the populations on the earth to make this claim? If God could speak in ancient times, there's no reason God can't speak now. Even the so called Bible, was brought together by the church leaders during the Roman Empire to Emperor Constantine by his approval. He could have cared less as long as there was peace in the empire.

  \cellcolor{green!27}Kosovo is another Tito plan just as Macedonia to make Serbia smaller. North Macedonia was Serbian land in 1914 (check it yourself) and as such entered Kingdom of Yugoslavia. It was considered Vardarska banovina (South Serbia) until 1045 when communist Tito overtrows Serbian Karadjordjevic dinasty from power and becomes a dictator. Not fin of Serbs because he was half Slovene half Croat, Tito decided to make internal borders sacrificing Serbs with excuse that Serbs being half of population would be too dominant (like Russians in USSR) so Tito separated South Serbia making them Macedonia (he mde that uo cause original Maceodnians were Greeks, belonging to Hellenic culture, and this Macedonians were just Serbs and Bulgarians living in Vardar Valley. They spoke Serbian with slight accent and Tito made them up a language and declare them separate nationality from Serbs.   With Kosovo, Kosovo was the hart of Serbian empire that existed in 14th century. Then Serbian empire had their emperor Dushan misteriously die during sleep while at 50 miles from conquering COnstantinople for Serbia, and than fortunes change, Dushan son is young and unprepared, Serbian empire strugles to keep united, and Ottomans take advantage and conquer the land for 4 centruries. When Serbs start kicking Ottomans out again, North Macedonia becomes part of Serbia, while South Macedonia becomes part of Greece, with small portion of eastern Macedonia going to Bulgaria. Kosovo was allways part of Serbia, however, since Albania was the poorest country in Europe and Yugoslavia gave maximal minority rights to Albanians like university in Albanian, thousands of Albanians jumped border and came from Albania to Kosovo during the 1950s. With Serbs being Christian European society having one-maximally two children and usually sending them to big cities to university, Serbs needed hands to worl land, and refugee Albanians came well. Howver, after 2 generations, Albanians illiterate and having 12 children became majority and started wanting indepenendence making terrorist organisation UCK which killed Serbs and unloyal ALbanians as well, put bombs in police stations and terrorised Serbs to leave. UCK was on CIA list of terrorist organisations, but USA anti-Serb policy made them change it and help UCK by giving them arms and training, and even intervening directly in war against FR Yugoslavia (Serbia). USA used nasty propaganda showing terrorists killed speaking how they are civilians slaughtered by Serbs, or showing old Albanian lady with golden teeth saying she was gangrapped several times by Serbian soldiers who killed all her familly and stole everything 8BUT FORGET THE golden teeth?

  \cellcolor{green!27}Wooooooooooooooooow hold it right there son, while it is true that ancient Greeks didn't consider Macedonians just as Greeks as themselves (mainly because Macedonia didn't compete in any wars against other Greek city states or didn't show particular interest for them / chose to be more isolated as they were busy fighting off Illyrians and other barbarian tribes off their north borders), formally they were considered Greeks as they were allowed to compete in the Olympic Games (a privilege only Greeks enjoyed) and spoke Greek / considered themselves Greeks just like in any other part of ancient Greece.  North Macedonia  is a completely different matter, as this country is divided between Albanian and Bulgarian speakers (mostly) and generally are considered / are considering themselves as Slavs, a tribe that resided in the Balkan peninsula almost 800 years after the collapse of the Macedonian empire. The beef between Greece and North Macedonia is completely irrelevant to the Ancient Macedonians - Ancient Greeks beef, hence your argument is completely invalid. In the first case we're talking about regional rivalries between the same ethnic group, in the second case it's 2 completely different countries with nothing in common except sharing a border, having a disagreement.

I never ever understood why, after the fall of Communism, when Romania was forming a new Constitution, why they did not just take the American Constitution and copy it identically.  USA    may not be perfect, but it's as close to perfect as we will get on this planet.  Why don't other countries just adopt the American Constitution??!  Sure, we have corruption here in America but at least it's manageable and they get caught often ONLY BECAUSE we have a system of  checks and balances.

  \cellcolor{green!5}Ireland and are only partly allies, especially since Brexit. Most English don't know all that much about Ireland and our mutual history. The horrible things, like the famine and the troubles (which every Irish family has a bleak sorrowful story of) aren't that long ago that it can just be forgotten about. And the landed gentry of England still look upon us with disgust. When I was at university, I visited London for a concert, and there were signs in some pub windows that said  no dogs, no wogs,  no Irish  this was in 1987. Two years ago when I was there I didn't see as many there, but i went into a few pubs and the signs were still there, only inside, and meant as a quaint laugh.  & \cellcolor{green!5}Brexit & \cellcolor{green!5}European or anti-Europeans & \cellcolor{green!5}1/129 & \cellcolor{green!5}0.775 \\  \hline
  \cellcolor{green!27} Noah Dunford don't hate your history. Use the knowledge of past atrocity to ensure it never happens again. This something all of us, us meaning humanity, should do. The Black and Tans did horrible things, but the people that made up the units werent necessarily horrible people..Militant factions like the IRA and Sinn F in were just as bad, but again, the members weren't inherently evil either. Cultural genocide starts as intolerance in the governments and through propaganda and fear or misunderstanding it grows. It destroys the feeling of security that we build our communities upon and people are willing to fight and die to protect that safe feeling. Eventually the point is reached where the 'other' is no longer the sole face of fear, but your own countrymen, kith and kin, are just as responsible. Such is the nature of the  human condition .

  \cellcolor{green!5}Idiot, millions of Irish people came to live in England and made great friends with their English neighbours.

Is true that some worship the Greek gods too. Not denying that. But they were different people.  If Macedonians were Greeks why in the 20 century they were exiled from their own home? That means you killed and exiled your own people. Imagine if you are forbidden to speak your native language to deny everything you are. To forbid your culture to get arrested just for speaking a language that is not yours,Soldiers are listening on your door. That is not freedom.
