And they started cutting my hair and saying it was ugly.\u2019', 'Amari says her tormentors ran off after the recess bell rang.', 'She was too scared to tell anyone about what happened until Wednesday, when her grandma Cynthia Allen noticed the missing dreads while styling the little girl\u2019s hair.', 'Amari told her what happened through tears, leaving Allen distraught.', 'The grandma told NBC Washington: \u2018It was like she just died.
