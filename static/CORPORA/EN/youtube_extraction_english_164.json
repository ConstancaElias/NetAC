I was looking at kids clothes...my daughter was 4 and my son was 7, but they weren't with me.  A lady shopper near me looked over and said \"Are you a grandmother?\"  I was totally flabbergasted!  How in the world could she think that?  It then occurred to me that, in fact, I could be a grandmother at 40.  What a wake up call.  I was carded for real until i was 35, so this just threw me for a loop.  At my curren<b> t ag</b>e, younger people always seem to assume I'm senile and set in my ways.  Come on!  I have kept myself in shape and I keep up with current clothing trends (although I do go for looks that would suit a 30 ye<b> ar o</b>ld and not a teen).  I'm on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram.  I have been playing Pokemon GO since it came out, and I used to be in Second Life.  In other words, I think young.  My Great Aunt used to wear orthopedic shoes and house dresses...typi<b> cal </b>old lady clothes...I swore I would never look like that, and I don't.  I think I relate to younger people.  I have a 5 <b> year</b> old Granddaughter, and I hope when I die, she won't remember me as<b>  thi</b>s old lady...in fact, I hope she will say \"WOW, she was too young to die\".  I'm <b> afraid </b>ageism isn't going away, but maybe if people will start giving someone a chance before making assumptions, that would be a start.",

The lesson plan was designed to showcase the individual, their <b> age </b>and their strong suits, which is exactly the point of the experiment.

You can't have a social experiment where one person is the same as the other based on<b>  age</b>, ability and what goes with that, when people are drastically different ages. This experiment cannot be done in a math class where they could have taught the same material, with the same lesson plan, etc, for a result because this is not a math class... he is not a math teacher. Therefore it will not be taught the same way because it will not be a straight forward, this and this will give you this result, instruction of the material.",

He let us do whatever we wanted in his classes, you could pick to learn only one lesson and you'd get an A for the rest of the year. And while I did my best to listen to his lectures which he held very quietly, almost none of the other kids did, and some would even leave the classroom or stand up on desks and things like that. But everybody loved that teacher! I later went on and actually graduated biology, but lacking elementary knowledge sometimes haunted me throughout my studies. He lives nearby me, so we sometimes meet - we greet everytime, he asks about my grandma's health which is very lovely. He was the best teacher AND the oldest. Thanks for reading my memoirs. \ud83d\ude0a",
