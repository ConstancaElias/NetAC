        "postText": " Over one billion dollars' worth of heroin each year - that is the deadly fallout Pakistan gets from the blooming narcotics industry that provides the main cash crop in devastated Afghanistan. Locals say heroin is cheaper than food.  It's thought Pakistan has more than four million drug addicts, but less than 80 dedicated drug rehab clinics.

If you buy it in the suburbs you pay 10 a bag for being too scared to go into the ghetto in Newark,Paterson,Irvington Nj and buying it for 3 a bag... All the bags cost that price. I'm sure since your saying b.s. you are one of the scared one's paying 10 to 20 a bag cause you don't know where to go or your to scared to drive mommy and daddy's car into the ghetto\ud83d\ude09",

It's a very rich language. The word Allah is simply the Arabic word for God. It's what's used by Arabic Christians too for example. The Kaba's foundations were raised by Abraham - but it had been originally built by Adam.  Before all the pyramids and whatnot. But there's none so <b> blind </b>as those who don't want to look.
