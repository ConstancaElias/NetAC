I can appreciate your coming to terms with the nature of erotic art and it seems you are providing a positive perspective that must be recognized. Hats off to you!",

            "commentText": "Just because something appeals to a particular demographic it doesn't automatically make it \"sexist.\" <b> Sexism </b>is exclusionary by definition. Not catering to someone in particular isn't excluding, it is simply not catering. There is a very important difference here.\n\nIf I were to create something I enjoyed specifically for me to enjoy, does that make me sexist/racist/homophobic/transphobic/whatever-ism-ic because I didn't go out of my way to please people that aren't me? No, of course it doesn't. If I make a ham sandwich because I like ham sandwiches, it doesn't make me anti chicken sandwich. I wasn't thumbing my nose at people who prefer chicken sandwiches. It wasn't a secret dig at vegans. It's just a man making a ham sandwich because he likes ham sandwiches.\nIf you're going to make negative assumptions about me and my motives simply because I didn't personally consult you before making a decision, then it is you who is in the wrong, not me.\n\nSo some people enjoy idealised depictions of the human body. Who cares? What harm does it do? And what's wrong with an idealised body anyway? Shouldn't it be something to aspire to, or at very least admire?\nIf you don't personally like idealised depictions of the human body then that's great. You're entitled to your opinion. However, that doesn't give you the right to go around insulting and attacking people who do like them.",

That being said, I do similar artwork... and have been called everything from a masterful genius to a perverted sexist deviant. So, I guess, opinions are really a mixed bag.\n\nI've always believed that 'good' or 'successful' art elicits an emotional response; either good or bad. One of my favourite things to do is listen to what people say about my artwork, without them knowing I'm the artist,  when they're being shown in galleries. And while I love the ones that love my work, the critics that downright hate my work are a lot more interesting. I can honestly say that I didn't put anything disgusting, sexist, or terrible in my artwork, so when people see those things in there, it makes me wonder if they brought that to the experience themselves.",

I love by the way that you are listening silently to the opinions of the viewer of your art. That's a very brave thing to do cause I can imagine it can be hurting sometimes as well as people can be mean. \ud83d\ude05 but I understand that the artist can learn a lot by it. About how the his art is seen. And as you said also about preconceived opinions about erotic art in general.

            "commentText": "I definitely don't think Kinky Karrot's art is sexist, but I also think that some of the criteria used to determine whether something is sexist is <b> fuzzy.</b> For example, I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with an artist only being interested in drawing sexualized women who don't have any real depth of character. What matters most are the ideas behind it; if an artist draws sexualized women as an expression of his/her ideas that women are MERELY<b>  sexual</b> beings, or aren't worthy of respect, or are only useful to <b> a sexua</b>l capacity, then yeah, I would characterize the artist as sexist, but I don't know how that would be expressed in their art, since the art itself could be identical to that by another artist who has liberal, progressive, feminist views on women. \nIt's a bit of a case of \"judging a book by its cover\". But I definitely wouldn't characterize Karrot's art as sexist, because (as she explains in the video), a lot of the features of her art show a deeper, richer view on women than would otherwise be shown by most artists who may ACTUALLY be sexist.",

            "commentText": "I think <b> sexism </b>in art is when the artist fails to depict a character as a person with agency and instead creates a soulless object for their or other's pleasure. It's more than just idealized feminine features. Many sexist artists fail to depict their characters, especially females, as unique individuals. They see a collection of body parts before they picture a person in their mind. Many of their characters have the same facial features, poses, and bodies. Many of their characters aren't expressive or enthusiastic. I think it's important for us as artists to try to replicate reality, especially in fantasy, so that the immersion is stronger and the people we depict are respected.",

While most of the responses where great I did get a few of I shouldn't be objectifying women. I was a little confused on what I created was bad?? I come to realize I don't care.

            "commentText": "The short answer is not in my opinion. You are creating characters that are consenting and reveling in their own sexuality and <b> sexual </b>power. Hardly a basis for any definition of<b>  sexism</b>. The longer answer. If we take the definition o<b> f sexis</b>m for the Oxford English dictionary as \"prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination on the basis <b> of s</b>ex\" I don't find your characters prejudical, none are saying they are of less (or greater) worth than others simply because if th<b> ere gen</b>der. Are you discriminating by drawing the female form? If it is a form you like and have a desire to draw, then know. Was Van Gogh discriminating against roses because he liked to draw sunflowers? I doubt many would say so. \n\nSo are you stereotyping? I think there is enough variety within your work to make the argument this is not the case. I suppose one could make the case that your \"Superhoeroines\" (\"Harlequin\", \"Amazon Goddess\" & \"Lois & Superman\") are more stereotypical images. However, that argument would be based on the long narrative history of those characters and not t<b> heir ge</b>nder.\n\nWas the work of Archie Dickens sexist? I don't believe so. His characters always had a playful/impish quality that showed their ownership of their sexuality.\n\nWas the work of Irving Klaw sexist. A topic of great debate, given some of the most famous Bettie Page bondage photos where done by Klaw. On the surface and looking at a particular photo, I have had people tell me that it is. \"How<b>  is a </b>woman in bondage and peril not sexist!\" But, must not one look at a body of work to make a claim. Show that same person the female dominatrix photos he took, and they often change their tune on those photos. Add to that the myriad of specific costume and shoe fetish photos he did. Which are sexist and which aren't. Is is body of work sexist? When looking at it as a totality, I would have to say no. If anything, relative to its time, it was the antithe<b> sis of </b>sexism.\n\nAre the main characters in the Story of O by Pauline R\u00e9age and the Beauty series by Ann Rice  sexist, even though we have female authors writing about main characters often in the position of being<b>  female</b> sexual submissives? Since in both cases, the characters are choosing to do what they do ONLY because they OWN their sexuality.\n\nPeople/characters who truly own their own sexuality are still far from the norm (at least here in the US, perhaps Berlin in is different, although I doubt it) People/characters who truly own their own sexuality are those who truly understand their own power and freedom. When understanding one's own power and freedom becomes the norm, perhaps than it can be stereotyped. (Although I have my doubts, sadly, that day will ever come.)\n\nYour works don't meet any of the criteria for being sexist. Please keep doing what you love. You are so very talented and your subject matter is worthy of the fine creations you bring to life.",

Kein einfaches Thema, denn nat\u00fcrlich k\u00f6nnte man wieder mit dem Argument der Kunstfreiheit kommen, die ja auch ein Grundrecht ist. Ebenso k\u00f6nnte man sagen \"das liegt im Auge des Betrachters\". Das w\u00e4re mir pers\u00f6nlich aber zu einfach. Nat\u00fcrlich \"darf\" Kunst sexistisch sein, wenn man danach geht. Kunst \"darf\" auch provozieren oder politisch sein... Dass dies allerdings schon \u00f6fter nach hinten losging, ist nichts neues und ich wei\u00df nicht, wo man da die imagin\u00e4re Linie ziehen sollte. Sexismus in der Kunst w\u00fcrde f\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich da anfangen, wo dargestellter <b> Sex </b>nur plakativ ist und bewusst provokant eingesetzt wird. Wenn Darstellungen herabw\u00fcrdigend sind und es nur Mittel zum Zweck ist, ist eine unsch\u00f6ne Grenze erreicht, die mit der Absicht \u00fcberschritten wird, um anzuecken und zu provozieren. Ist es dann noch Kunst oder ist es dann Pornographie? Wie gesagt, ein schwieriges Thema...\nAnders verh\u00e4lt es sich mit erotischer Kunst, die in meinen Augen in ihrer Darstellung auch viel ansprechender sein kann. Es kann ein Blick, eine Geste sein, die das Knistern in einem Bild vermittelt. Das Spiel von Licht- und Schattenwurf auf den dargestellten Charakteren. Zeichnerische Andeutungen, die das nicht sichtbare erahnen lassen, k\u00f6nnen viel ansprechender und inspirierender sein, als das Offensichtliche. ;-)\n\nHerzliche Gr\u00fc\u00dfe\n-Marcel",

Kann dich also gut verstehen... \nWenn Kunst sexistisch ist, um zu provozieren und eine (gute) Message zu verbreiten, sehe ich es vollkommen ein. Es darf nur nicht sein, wenn es positiv dargestellt und verherrlicht wird. \nIch finde auch, dass Pornografie gut sein kann. Ich denke, nicht alle Arten von Pornografie m\u00fcssen sexistisch sein. Im Gegenteil. In dem Comic, den ich f\u00fcr Kinky Karrot machen werde, werde ich pornografische Elemente nutzen, die nichts mit Sexismus zu tun haben! Es geht also auf jeden Fall!\nDas gr\u00f6\u00dfte Problem ist meiner Meinung einfach das schlimme Frauenbild, das bei vielen leider nach wie vor in den K\u00f6pfen steckt. Frauen werden viel zu oft zu sehr auf ihre sexuellen Attribute reduziert und zu Sexobjekten runtergestuft. Das m\u00fcssen wir \u00e4ndern!",

Provokant im positiven Sinne, um die leider immer noch verschrobene Denkweise vieler Hinterw\u00e4ldler offen zu legen und diesen damit bewusst vor den Kopf zu sto\u00dfen, halte ich f\u00fcr mehr als berechtigt. Starke Frauen, zu denen ich Dich nat\u00fcrlich auch z\u00e4hle, die offen mit Sexualit\u00e4t umgehen und einem Teil der Gesellschaft l\u00e4chelnd den Spiegel vorhalten, um zu zeigen, dass sie mit ihrem Schubladen-Denken mit Vollgas vor die Wand fahren. Wer Deine offene Art und k\u00fcnstlerisch \u00e4sthetische Darstellung sexistisch findet, der haut auch zum Feuermachen noch zwei Steine aneinander.\nNat\u00fcrlich kann auch Pornografie positiv sein. Mir ging es dort haupts\u00e4chlich um den Punkt der Herabw\u00fcrdigung. Da ist die Grenze deutlich \u00fcberschritten und wir w\u00e4ren wieder beim Thema Hinterw\u00e4ldler. Aktuelle Meldungen aus Hollywood und auch Deutschland zeigen, dass von dieser Spezies leider noch sehr viele Exemplare existieren.\nAuf Deinen Kinky Karrot-Comic freue ich mich schon sehr!",
