        "postText": " In recognition of International Women's Day, which takes place this year on 8th March 2017, Expert Market scoured the London streets for women who were willing to share their experiences of sexism in the workplace.  And we didn't have to look too far! Sexist remarks at work seem all too prevalent. From unfair uniform rules to crude remarks in the office, workplace sexism is rife. The International Women's Day campaign asks that we #BeBoldForChange. Here at Expert Market we agree - it's time to take a stand on workplace sexism in 2017.

Repugnant, plain men, if I can put it that way, are more likely to attract opprobrium, except from sweet natured girls who feel sorry for them. <b> Woman,</b> generally, have a higher emotional awareness than men and appreciate how socially clumsy many \"blokes\" are.   It's true that many young women want men to notice them.  If that were not true, we wouldn't have so much money spent on alluring fashion items and cosmetic surgery.  It just comes down to treating women respectfully and not invading their social space.",

Young women have been indoctrinated by radical feminists who control the education system. They are taught to do the same thing as men and to put a working career ahead of being a parent. To demonstrate this you only have to look at the almost insane attention that was given to the mythical 'pay gap' and the high level of propaganda used to generate such myths.\n2. Women are taught that men are evil. The enormous exaggerations regarding <b> sexual </b>assault /<b>  sexual</b> harassment / domestic violence ... demonstrate this. (Shown in videos such as RAPE HYSTERIA - Part 1 | History Repeats Itself )\n3. High levels of government welfare means that women no longer need a strong family group for security. \n4. Funding. Governments fund feminist causes to win the female vote. Women vote collectively on women's issues, men also support women. George Soros also funds feminism through his Open Society Foundation (he funds all causes that destabilise white countries).",

                    "commentText": "Correct Stephen, but look deeper. There are several reasons for the low reproduction rate of intelligent white females. \n1. Young women have been indoctrinated by radical feminists who control the education system. They are taught to do the same thing as men and to put a working career ahead of being a parent. To demonstrate this you only have to look at the almost insane attention that was given to the mythical 'pay gap' and the high level of propaganda used to generate such myths.\n2. Women are taught that men are evil. The enormous exaggerations regarding <b> sexual </b>assault /<b>  sexual</b> harassment / domestic violence ... demonstrate this. (Shown in videos such as RAPE HYSTERIA - Part 1 | History Repeats Itself )\n3. High levels of government welfare means that women no longer need a strong family group for security. \n4. Funding. Governments fund feminist causes to win the female vote. Women vote collectively on women's issues, men also support women. George Soros also funds feminism through his Open Society Foundation (he funds all causes that destabilise white countries).",

Because last time I checked, calling a <b> woman </b>baby or darling kind of meant they were special to you. And there's a really good prager U video that debunks the wage gap entirely. And just because a man is in a gym and sees a pretty<b>  woman</b>, that means he can't look at her? I'm confused on that as well, given it's male nature to look at something pretty. Prager U has a good video on that as well. When a guy sees a pretty girl, however many seconds he spends looking at her is how long he spends forgetting about her. He'll be at home later, unaware that she ever existed.\n\nSo please, where is it written that there's moral inequality between men and women?",

But that is nowhere NEAR as bad as it was decades ago. There will always be a concept of<b>  sexism</b>, not just on girls, but on boys as well. You can't emasculate boys from doing boyish things, such as seeing a pretty girl and being naturally attracted to the opposit<b> e se</b>x. You ALSO can't keep girls from doing girlish things, like having children (in relation to things like abortion.) There are separate strengths and weaknesses that both the majority of boys and the majority of girls have. We need to accept that and come to terms with it instead of stifle it in<b> to nothi</b>ng. Since the dawn of time women have been called sweetheart, not out of an act of superiority, but out of an act of kindness and affection. Has the goal of feminism changed so radically that we're trying to get rid of acts of kindness? Really?",
