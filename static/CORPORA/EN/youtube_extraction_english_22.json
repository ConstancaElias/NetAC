        "postText": " In this fascinating talk, founder of the award-winning EverydaySexismProject, Laura Bates, talks about her inspiring initiative. The EveryDaySexism is an ever-increasing collection of over 50,000 women's experiences of gender imbalance. The stories come from women of all ages, races and sexual orientations, disabled and non-disabled, employed and unemployed, religious and non-religious. The project has expanded into 18 countries worldwide and become internationally renowned, featuring in media from the New York Times to French Glamour, CNN to Grazia South Africa, Cosmopolitan to the Times of India. See more in: www.everydaysexism.com. In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations) ",

            "commentText": "0:49\u00a0So everybody on the bus reacted the same way as if you were a man. And you're calling this '<b> sexism'</b>. You don't know what<b>  sexism</b> is, do you? Just because people don't jump to your aid and help the poor maiden who's claiming to be in distress that does mean society is sexist, it means you feel entitled as <b> a woma</b>n to being protected. Sorry, equality's a bitch.\n\n3:48 Disparity is not discrimination. For example, you say 1 in 5 people in parliament are women? Okay, what percentage of people trying to get IN to parliament are women? Because if it's anywhere near 20%, then there's no discrimination. You keep using the term 'gender equality' when you mean to say 'gender parity'. This entire section is just you talking about disparity as though it is discrimination, and that is openly dishonest; and the fact that you'd use such a tactic\u00a0to make your argument instead of using actual evidence of discrimination proves two things: 1)\u00a0You are an intellectually dishonest person, and 2) There are no actual examples of discrimination for you to present, because if they existed, you would use them.\u00a0Parity is arbitrary and anybody seeking parity at the expense of fair treatment is a pretty awful person who's just seeking power.\n\n5:11 \"84% front page articles are dominated by male subjects\"\nWhat is a \"male subject\"? Is it any subject that doesn't cater specifically to women? Because subjects, especially news subjects, don't have to cater exclusively to one gender; and just because the front page news article isn't about shoes and fashion, that doesn't mean it's directed solely at men.\n\n5:24 \"Only 1 in 5 UK architects is female, yet 63% of them report experienci<b> ng sexu</b>al harassment in the workplace during the course of their career\"\nWhat the hell do you mean \"yet\"? Those two claims are in no way related whatsoever; it's a complete non-sequitur.\n\n5:40 This entire section is just ridiculous. You are claim<b> ing sex</b>ism against women, not because women are the predominant victims of crimes (Because they aren't), but simply because women\u00a0ARE victims of crimes. That's insane. So in your mind, unless we live in a world where men are the victims of crime and women aren't, the world is sexist. You are messed up. Also, half the statistics you quote here are crap you've made up, and the fact you have to do that just further demonstrates not only how dishonest you are, but that your position holds absolutely no merit, as you feel you have to lie to justify it.\n\n6:07 \"1 in 3 women will be raped or beaten in her lifetime\"\nSo, correct me if I'm wrong, but what you're saying here is that 2 in 3 women, the SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY of women, live their entire lives without being the victim of violence? That's incredible. Human beings live a long time, and their lives are complicated.\u00a0The idea of being alive for that long without ever being the victim of violence is unfathomable to me. But you're telling me not only is this the reality for some women, but for the significant majority of them? And this is worldwide, even including countries were people are beaten\u00a0on regular basis?\u00a0 What number of men are beaten or raped in their lifetime? 49 out of 50? This is not an exampl<b> e of se</b>xism against women, this is an exclamation that women are a pampered and protected class.\n\n6:11 \"I decided that that argument that women were equal now really didn't stand up to scrutiny\"\nYou're right, you have all the same opportunities, MORE rights, and are treated much more favourably by society.\u00a0Women would\u00a0need to be taken down quite a few pegs before men and women could ever be considered equals.\n\nNot a single examp<b> le of s</b>exism was given. I think you have a different definition to the one I'm using. Yours seems to be \"Everybody doesn't live their lives how I want them to and consider me more important\". Boohoo.",

The implied 2nd class status of women in our society is harmful to everyone. Time for a cultural shift.",

She doesnt mention 1 MAN a week also dies at the hands of a partner. Not exactly insignificant is it. Also, in domestic situations MORE women are violent than men. She doesnt mention that either. If she is going to speak about equality, she should present statistics which represent BOTH GENDERS how can you discuss equality only mentioning one side?",
