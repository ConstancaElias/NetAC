        "postText": "A Muslim teenager reportedly had her hijab removed, was forced to the ground and was pelted with eggs by a gang of youths.', 'Police are investigating after a video of the attack in the Dublin suburb of Dundrum was posted online.', 'Calls are now being made for effective hate crime legislation to be introduced in Ireland to curb violence and discrimination.', 'A garda spokeswoman said no arrests have been made and an investigation into the incident on Sunday is ongoing.', 'Irish Green Party deputy leader Catherine Martin said: \u2018This is absolutely appalling. We must stand firm against any and all racism.', '\u2018Violence like this stems from racist rhetoric. Words become actions.', '\u2018We must condemn racism at all levels if we want to stop violence and discrimination taking hold.\u2019', 'Dr Ali Selim, a leading figure in the Irish Muslim community, also called for hate crime legislation to be introduced.', 'He said: \u2018It\u2019s a shock to everybody living in Ireland. If this is happening in the middle of the day and in this area, where would you let your children go to?', '\u2018Most people have been really supportive on social media. Very few individuals are critical about the situation, but that gives the general impression of the situation in Ireland.', '\u2018The mainstream are pro-cohesiveness and pro-justice and equality for everyone, regardless of your faith and race. It is our responsibility to maintain this cohesiveness.', '\u2018There is a desperate need for hate crime legislation in Ireland. We didn\u2019t have that in the past and that is understood because in the past Irish society was made of one and the same group.', '\u2018Today we have a wide range of diversity and faiths in various communities and that enhances the need to have hate crime legislation to prevent such incidents from happening again.\u2019",

I see <b> nothing </b>wrong with wearing a headscarf, and find the French outlawing of them unfair and unnecessary. But there are other religions and sects that insist on a certain dress code for their followers, most orders of Christian nuns for example, are also covered from head to toe. Girl dressing modestly is seen as a religious symbol, yet girls in short skirts hitched up revealing their knickers is perfectly acceptable and not an insult to Christianity and therefore also a religious issue? It\u2019s funny how democracy is linked to freedom when it seems to be taking people\u2019s freedom away, the freedom to choose.You shouldn\u2019t be able to order a<b>  woman</b> to go around wrapped up from head to toe, but you shouldn\u2019t be able to order her to go around half naked either. What is wrong with a girl wearing a long skirt.According to a Japanese revert, \"the hijab reminds people who see it that God exists, and it serves as a constant reminder to me that I should conduct myself as a Muslim. Just as police officers are more professionally aware while in uniform, so I had a stronger sense of being a Muslim wearing my hijab\". 'Revert' not 'convert' coz every human were born into Islam but the environment changes one faith. Wearing the hijab soon became spontaneous, albeit purely voluntary. No human being could force me to wear it; if they had, perhaps I would have rebelled and rejected it. However, the first Islamic book I read used very moderate language in this respect, saying that \u201cAllah recommends it (the hijab) strongly\u201d and since Islam (as the word itself indicates) means we are to obey Allah\u2019s will I accomplished my Islamic duties willingly and without difficulty, Alhamdulillah.The hijab reminds people who see it that God exists, and it serves as a constant reminder to me that I should conduct myself as a Muslim.

Or how about Rotherham? Could go on for quite a while you know. Something lilly livered, spineless leftists like you can't stand.Perhaps we can have a look at the Qu'ran. Or maybe have a look at how Islam has affected every civilization it's ever spread into. Nope. I'm a <b> Nazi.</b> Typical leftie tactic.

Don't these hypocrites idiots know what their ancestors did to Native American Indians they slaughtered 150 millions of Native American Indians! and also do they know that Great Britain invaded 80% countries around the world? They should call them <b> terrorist </b>first and as well call their ancestors<b>  terrorist</b>! British did the same to Native American Indians and sadly they still treat Native American Indians badly! So Americans Indians know how you Muslims feel! They stole<b> n India</b>n land and killed 150 millions of Indians the British did! They were forced to go to the white man's school and learn the language, culture and faith of the white man. Inspite of that, they are still the under dogs of the American society.  [LINK] ",
