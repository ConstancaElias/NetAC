        "postText": "American Psycho author Bret Easton Ellis appeared on Channel 4 News this week and seriously asked the question: \u2018Is misogyny and homophobia really the worst things out there?\u2019', 'Unfortunately it isn\u2019t \u2013 murder and rape would probably be the most extreme answer \u2013 but, being blindly ignorant to racism and the fact a successful white man in Hollywood is probably using this privilege to his advantage on a daily basis without even knowing it, is also up there.', 'So yes Bret, misogyny and homophobia really are that bad and it\u2019s terrifying that a 55 year old man with such an esteemed career as an author \u2013 thus the power to influence minds with his words \u2013 can\u2019t recognise that.', 'As the agonising interview moves on, Bret points out that he\u2019s simply \u2018a human being\u2019.', 'He\u2019s \u2018not defined by his whiteness or maleness\u2019.', 'It must be nice to be judged by anything other than your gender or skin colour \u2013 a luxury many black women do not have.', 'But remarkably, Bret seems to think he receives more online abuse than black women. Pressed on this topic further by the show\u2019s host Cathy Newman, the writer said deadpan: \u2018We all bear our burdens.\u2019', 'Social media bullying is probably the worst thing about the internet and nobody deserves to be bombarded with nasty comments, but this is the point where you have permission to laugh at Bret\u2019s naivety.', 'Black women are 84 per cent more likely than white women to be mentioned in abusive tweets, according to research from Amnesty International but, of course, it would be easy to believe a white man is more crucified than a woman of colour if you\u2019re living in an alternate universe with rose-tinted glasses on like Bret seems to be.', 'So, should black women just accept the abuse they get online?', 'Shrug their shoulders when called the n-word or any other cliched racial slurs likely hurled towards them at some point in their lives?', 'The numbers are shocking but social media is just the tip of the discrimination women of colour receive because, sadly, trolls exist beyond the computer screen.', 'In November, a study by the EU\u2019s agency for fundamental rights said that black people were \u2018facing widespread and entrenched prejudice and exclusion\u2019 across the European Union \u2013 30 per cent said they had experienced some form of racial harassment, including racist violence, in the previous five years.', 'But Bret would probably say we\u2019re being \u2018too sensitive\u2019 about it.', 'He believes the world has gone to the extreme of being politically correct so, that\u2019s right sisters, we should probably just grin and bear the burden of racism.', 'Free speech should exist but it comes with the danger that someone like Bret is given the platform to spread ideals that are just simply untrue and ignorant.', 'The black community cannot truly prosper or reap the benefits of change when the privileged white man thinks there\u2019s nothing to change.', 'How do we educate someone like Bret who doesn\u2019t see that a problem exists?', 'At the end of his interview, Bret claimed he \u2018doesn\u2019t get a free pass\u2019 in society as a white man.', 'Well, I can assure him that neither do us women of colour.', 'Clearly, we both believe in our own realities but only one is the truth.', 'The sorry truth is that white privilege will probably always exist and is deep-rooted in our society \u2013 it\u2019s just that most haven\u2019t exposed themselves as Bret has.', 'But it\u2019s definitely real, ugly and staring at you right in the face.', 'Bret complained that we \u2018make such a huge deal\u2019 of racism, misogyny and homophobia, but continuing to make noise about his ilk is likely the only hope we have of making a real change.', 'So sorry Bret, but making a \u2018huge deal\u2019 out of your comments is the only way to go.', '\u2018Bear the burden\u2019 of that.",
