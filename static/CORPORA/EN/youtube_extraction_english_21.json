Supper was on the table when Dad got home. She also endured endless time at our summer cottage on the water with the kids as my Dad worked. She had plenty of time to shop with my aunt. She also made our clothes and canned vegetables. She was involved with the P.T.A.. Sorry ladies, your doing something wrong. My parents expected a partnership. Dad worked, Mom worked. Sometimes they worked together. I can recall them hanging wallpaper and painting to prepare a new house. Dad \"ruled\" and Mom handled the money.",

I'm happy this video just makes light of t<b> he o</b>ld school stereotypes instead of making it a call to war.",

That showed both sides and she said THATS JUST LIKE A MAN, but once again, that's not sexist on the girls side is it!\n\n6.  Women baked back then what's bad about that?\n\n5.  No one could understand that enough to call it sexist\n\n4.  He got her flowers and everything, then she made bad coffee, so he told her... NOT SEXIST\n\n3.  Guys like girls, so they buy stuff on TV that said it would get them chicks.... STILL NOT SEEING THE<b>  SEXISM</b>\n\n2.  Women do that today, what's the problem? \n\n1.

They were who saw these commercials. They were supposed to be funny and catchy to housewives.  Women then were essentially managers of the home and they did a great job at it. That is <b> nothing </b>to be ashamed of.  It's not easy to properly manage a household. My grandmothers home was kept hotel clean. We rarely ran out of anything. She prepped all the meals did all the purchasing and day care.     There is<b>  nothing</b> sexist or demeaning about doing one of the hardest jobs, without a day off or even an hour off. You're always on duty. I know this because at 40 I became a stay at home dad. And I suck at it. Try if you can. You'll realize women were stronger, smarter and more capable than most are now.",

So by posting this are you suggesting that there are no stereotype these days? No commercial now would dream of belittling a <b> woman,</b> No they are all superhuman out there saving the poor little man who is to dump to figure out which insurance to buy, and so on. How's that working out for the good<b>  old</b> USA. Respect isn't in such short supply that there is only enough for on<b> e se</b>x at a time. If your point is that these commercials are denigrating, and they are, then you should understand that people where being made to feel less worthy. N<b> ot wom</b>an, not Blacks, or Chinese, not people with long hair,<b>  or<b>  </b</b>>red hair, not people with freckles, or a stutter; just people, and when anyone is degraded, we are all made smaller. \nSo if you don't like what happened , I agree unfortunately it did,\u00a0but the past is hard to change; it is useful though if we learn from it, and we could do something about how each of us treats the people in our worlds today.\u00a0 So how are you doing with that?",

So if a wife is concerned about her husband driving in dangerous circumstances, would that be sexist too?  I'm always concerned about anyone I care about - male or female - when they are driving long distances or at night or in a dangerous area.\n\nNext!",

            "commentText": "The preponderance of comments here show complete ignorance of the <b> sexism </b>that existed throughout most of the 20th century. My mother was denied her divorce petition by the judge, who said \"and how will you be able to support your children?\". When I was 19 and working at a major food company that paid for its employees to go to school, I was turned down for photography because \"a girl wouldn't be able to carry the equipment\". (My super-slender<b>  ga<b> y</b</b>> guy friend was approved for the same class). Our classified ads were divided into \"Help Wanted: Female\" and \"Help Wanted: Male\". The female pages were entirely filled with secretarial and waitressing jobs. In high school, I wanted to play the drums for my music curriculum. I was told \"you can't play the drums \u2013 you're a girl!\" When I was 18 I went down to the newspaper to sub for my 13 ye<b> ar o</b>ld brother (who managed a newsstand) when he was sick one day. The cigar-smoking circulation manager and a roomful of boys laughed me right out.. \"imagine, a girl selling newspapers! hahaha!\" I had many jobs \u2013 and all of them had male bosses. I never even sa<b> w a wo</b>man doctor, dentist, or cab driver (to name a few) until my late 30's. Men were pretty much given free rein to beat their wives. In many case<b> s, a w</b>oman couldn't make a major purchase without her husband's signature. I haven't even scratched the surface to give you an inkling of the discrimination females (o<b> f an</b>y age) faced every single day \u2013 I just wanted to list a few instances off the top of my head. It is an entirely different world today for females, who can pretty much do anything they want to do, and are not pressured by society to wait on men hand and foot, and to \"shut up and look pretty\".",

They grow facial hair and they have no <b> sex </b>drive. They become shriveled up prunes. Women are like cars. They're great  when they are new, but after three years, ,they start giving you trouble. I trade in my car and my<b>  woman</b> every three years. NEVER <b> a woma</b>n over 25. That's when they start going downhill. YOU know it's true. My father taught me this when I was a kid and since women ONLY care about MONEY, he told me to make certain I became wealthy. Money is the ONLY way to have a good car and a go<b> od wom</b>an. BUT, do not forget to trade them in EVERY THREE YEARS.",

As for the bad female driver stereotype, that came probably when cars were invented: women were expected to stay home back then w/ the kids, men would often drive their wives to places instead. It was a way of controling where they went, hence \"bad female driver stereotype\" became a thing as a consequence of them not driving as often, as they were expected to stay and care for the household. But women, and any<b>  ethnicity</b> drive the same as everyone else, it depends on the INDIVIDUAL PERSON...skin-color/sex ha<b> s nothin</b>g to do with it. \n\nBut a damn fact in life is that you ARE sexist, a<b> nd raci</b>st. And only sexist <b> and rac</b>ist people say something se<b> xist/ra</b>cist, then say they are NOT s<b> exist/r</b>acist, when their beliefs about others prove otherwise.\n\nI can't saying something like, \"All Whites are the KKK, that's just a fact of life.\" and <b> not be </b>racist. Which is what you just said about Asian people, and half of all humans (i.e. women). It's illogical.",

The <b> woman </b>often didn't get much practice.  But in my family my Grandmother (b. 1895) who was deputy mayor of her city was one of the first to own a car.

Thankfully, I had a father and male cousins who encouraged me in my (then) almost heretical view of \"woman's lot\".  I made up my mind that I would graduate high school (in the 1960s, dropping out to marry or get a job to help support your parents and siblings was somewhat acceptable) and earn a college degree.  Now in my seventh decade, I hold two degrees (one in mechanical engineering--the leading edge of so-called \"liberated\" women), three teaching credentials, and more certfications than I can count.  Now retired, I look back on a life that was lived MY WAY (apologies to Frank Sinatra) and was secure in the knowledge that, if I had to, I could support myself and my children comfortably.  While I horrified most of the women in my family, I had an aunt who applauded my independence along with my father and those wonderful male cousins who knew that a girl didn't have to be bound by her ability to make great coffee (I can), cook wholesome as well as gourmet meals (I can), and keep house (okay, I hate that part)  as well as bring home the high-quality bacon.",

I was a young girl when it was introduced and many of my friends and I drank Tab because weight-gain was always drummed into us by PE  (gym) and PA (homemaking for girls/shop for boys) teachers.  I was 13 when forced into my first panty girdle.  I hated it.  The only other option was a garter belt to hold up stockings (pantyhose was not invented yet and the earliest pantyhose on the market sagged at the knees and ankles within moments of donning them so they weren't much of an option early on, either.  There was a little Golden Book entitled \"The Saggy, Baggy Elephant\" that I read as a very young child whose title reminded me of the early attempts at pantyhose.",

Also, feminists in general.\n\nBut only the left believes in partriarchy, based on what I've noticed. Women, for a good couple of last decades, weren't forced to not to work. Even in my country, that would be easily considered conservative, we had female superiors for years. Young ones too.\n\nI don't think that feminism did their lives better. Or even if it did seem to do so, not for long, because whenever they are being asked whether they're a feminists by their potential boyfriends, they lie that they aren't or they think that they aren't when they are clearly using feminist logic (hence the question). Happened to me too, when I talked to a girl from abroad. She didn't seem like a bad person but after her questions and statements I easily pointed out her hypocrisy and bias to which she, well, gasped and giggled. If more women are being taught destructive ways of feminism, more of them will end up either with no boyfriends or weak boyfriends who are with them just to \"score it\" or because they're too unassertive to quit the toxic relationship ending up dissatisfying them too... Unless the feminists are lesbians, then /shrug.\n\nAnd here you are calling people assholes for seeing the world in a different perspective than you do (EDIT: if you're calling them an assholes for different opinion not for actually being assholes. If not, then you're fine)\nThat's the trait of current feminists - seeing only women as victims which is why I am \"flattering\" myself by saying that men are more selfless, because men jump around feminists ignoring their own problems and they/you only nod \"Yes, yes we are so badly treatened by society as everyone tries to comfort us and our ways are being taught on TV and in schools.

Cutting off their clitoris so they can never experience <b> sexual </b>pleasure.  Honor killings of women for the slightest perceived insult or imagined disrespect.

But, the majority of women lost out once they were no longer treated unequally in their favor.  Inequality has two sides, and does not always mean adverse discrimination.  In the <b> old </b>days women could expect protection, financial support, the kids, the property and everything else in perpetuity; and all at the male's expense.  Ok, so some women don't need that. It's true.  Some don't even want it.  But deep down everyone knows that being treated on the good side of inequality ain't a bad thing.",

I didn't get a 50% cut in my college tuition when I earned my engineering degree (late 1960s), but I was expected to accept 50% of the salary paid to the kid at the drafting table behind me with a vocational-technical certificate from high school.  I was expected to endure the patronizing pats on the head by chief<b>  engineers</b> when, protesting the salary inequity, I was told not to worry, that some man would marry me and take me away from all this.  I couldn't get a charge account unless my father agreed to co-sign it, although my landlord expected his rent from me, as did the light company, the water company, the gas company, and the grocery store.  I couldn't buy a car without my father's consent, although I wa<b> s ol</b>d enough to vote.<b>  A wom</b>an who got pregnant out of wedlock was at the mercy of her boyfriend's decision whether or not to marry her--and, if she chose to sue for child support, all he had to do was find 3 friends to say they took turns with him that night and he was free and clear of paternity.  My life is NOT circumscribed or determined by the men in it.  I love my father, who encouraged all that independence--which was unheard of for a girl of my day or a father who was Eastern European<b>  by ethnic</b>ity.  Women of my generation revolted against such inequity, and rightly so. What man would tolerate second-class citizenship like that which women endured?  What father worth the name could possibly stand by and watch that happen to his daughter without rising in righteous anger at a society that would permit it?",

Since you know so much better have it your way, but is this helping you or anyone else? Seeing that you decided to type out a whole damn book about how useless you believe women are besides 'sperm dumpsters' and 'human toilets'. (You keep using these terms btw, interesting.)\n\nYou are entitled to your opinion doc, but all you're doing is disrespecting human beings. You don't talk to anyone like that, it's wrong. Not just because you're talking to women or generalizing women, but humans. \n\nThey are alive and have a mind of their own, so of course they want to be their own person. They weren't made for the entertainment of anyone. Especially their potential partners.\n\nWe could go on and on about our opinions, or agree to disagree. I do not believe a human being is a waste of space, even if they make mistakes or have a different opinion than mine. You believe women are a waste of space.\n\nI do advice you to rethink your opinion, because you seem to have developed your opinion based on a non-factual book.

                    "commentText": "How to Deal With a <b> Woman </b>When She Says \"Excuse Me?\" \"I Beg Your Pardon?\" Etc.\n\nHi. I'm Professor Cos. When a<b>  woman</b> responds to something you say to her with \"excuse me\" or \"I beg your pardon\" or any type of \"how dare you\" tone, let her know that whatever effort she put into making her shrill shriekin<b> g woma</b>n voice sound stern and threatening only makes it sound cute. Let the cunt know that you won't be reconsidering what you said, nor will you be correcting yourself, or apologizing. This broad is just exercising her sense of entitlement and expecting you to correspond. This jaw dropping state of being appalled, is an expression made by women who have never been taught that respect is earned. She can't possibly believe that a man could ever talk to<b>  a wom</b>an like that.\n\nUnlike men, who live in the real world where anything can be said to anyone at anytime, and for any reason, most women think that the rules on what not to say to a \"lady\" shelters them from anything that shouldn't be told to a \"lady\". They also seem to think that the fem<b> ale gen</b>der is installed with some type of anti \"don't talk <b> to a w</b>oman like that\" software. And this is why it's very important to talk to women \"like that\".<b>  Be a chauv</b>inist<b> . Be a miso</b>gynist. Be disrespectful. Speak in ways that offend women. Treat women like sperm receptacles. Refer to women as sperm depositories. Use women like human toilets. Knock those semen extractors off their pedestals.\n\nYou see, when a cunt knows that you're not someone that can be shamed into respecting anything just because it has a vagina, that demanding \"empowered\" attitude either takes a backseat or goes right up her backside where it came from. Unless a bitch is willing to learn the hard way that you have no problem slapping her or knocking her out, she doesn't give you the \"excuse me, don't ta<b> lk to </b>a woman like that\" cuntfrontation.\n\nNow, it's one thing to acquiesce out of fear, and it's another thing to try and put someone in their place only because you think they might acquiesce to you. Have you noticed that feminists don't make much noise when middle eastern migrants start running amok on bitches? They don't dare confront those men because they know that those men will drag them by their necks and turn t<b> hem </b>into sex slaves. They get up in western men's faces because they are used to western men being pussies and apologizing for anythi<b> ng tha</b>t a woman gets offended by. Women only have as much power as men give them. Women's empowerment relies on men's weaknesses.\n\nFrom my observation, the same women that say \"excuse me, don't<b>  talk </b>to a woman like that\" to a guy that would acquiesce to them, are usually the same women that acquiesce to men that they know will clobber them half to death if they get up in those men's faces. I've seen so many women who were with men that treated them like shit, demanding respect from beta males while those poor suckers nodded obsequiously, thus providing those weak females with a false sense of empowerment. I've also seen women who listen to rap music telling men not to treat<b>  wom</b>en like sex objects, while they themselves were dressed in tight clothes. By the way, these are the same types of women that bitch about why women get shamed for sleeping around!\n\nSince these women aren't respectable creatures, the only way they can get anything close to respect is to demand it from spineless men who walk on eggshells just to get laid, or who were brainwashed into thinking that a \"real man\" must respect anything female or else he's not a \"real man\". These are women who disrespect themselves by dealing with abusive men because those men are the only types of alpha males they can get. These brainless broads are oblivious to how they look while clinging on to their idea of sacred preeminence and wondering why they aren't being perceived or treated that way. Not only is their sense of preeminence a big part of why they aren't being respected, their lack of self awareness perpetuates their comical mindset even more.\n\nI want to take a break from beating these dead horses to talk about something that has been disturbing me for quite some time. And as you should know, I won't be sugar coating, so brace yourselves.\n\nFirst of all, praying for S.H.T.F (shit hit the fan) to happen so that women can realize that they fucked up is like cutting off your nose to spite your face. White<b>  Knigh</b>ts and pussy beggars are going to be simping for these whores no matter what. You want white knights and women to be whores and wage slaves while you secede and go your own way.\n\nSecondly, there are a lo<b> t of men</b> with nothing to lose running amok. Not to mention the suicidal men are also figuring that it would be a better idea to take women with them. What I'm trying to say is that it looks like women are going to start getting randomly murdered soon, and I shouldn't be surprised. I don't know if it was just a joke, but there was also a Facebook group talking about serving as hit men on behalf of men who got taken to the cleaners. The backlash has been escalating, but now you can actually see it. I'm a man. I know how men react. Men don't hoot and holler when they're in distress like women do, they bottle up their contempt, then they let loose. By the way, I'm not a part of this shit, I'm just saying, so don't accuse me of anything.\n\nI'm having one of those \"be careful what you wish for\" moments because I secretly wanted to see a few women splattered about just to let women know what happens when you kick a dog in a corner for too long. But now I'm having a change of heart because angry suicidal men with guns are going to leave a bigger mess than just a few female bodies. Should that happen, there is going to be curfew and a lot of random searches. Plus there are going to be men who don't know when enough is enough.\n\nIf you happen to be one of those guys that are plotting this murderous rampage, I u<b> nde<b> r</b</b>>stand your red pill rage and I'm not judging you, but maybe you should reconsider that idea. Getting a few women killed might feel good, but then what??",

                    "commentText": "Mother Nature Is A Chauvinistic Pig.\n\n\n                         Hi I'm Professor Cos. THUNDER CUNTS!!.. Have you noticed that men don't need to say things like \"I can do anything a <b> woman </b>can do, and do it better, and do it in briefs\"?! Ladies, nature doesn't care that you understand politics. Nature doesn't care that you can do anything a man can do, and do it better, and do it in heels. As a female, you shall be sought after for reproductive purposes, in other words,<b>  sex</b>. As long as you're somewha<b> t se</b>x appealing, the very first thing a man cares about is figuring out how to get you to put your left leg by the 12, and your right leg by the 3. It's the card nature dealt you, therefore deal with it. Don't take it out on men, and don't shoot the messenger. Men didn't choose human biology any more than you did. You are a sperm receptacle, a sperm depository, a human toilet.\n\nIt's also very interesting how we call nature \"mother nature\" (I suppose for the sake of \"empowering\" women), yet we have feminists saying that nature is sexist, while women are bitching about the nature of things and blaming it on men! Bitches... Nature is supposedly female! And I guess she likes things the way things are! Like women, Mother Nature is a contr<b> ol fre</b>ak. Hey, \"women are smarter than men\", right ladies?! Mother Nature knows what she's doing! \"Leave her alone\", right ladies?! \"Don't talk to her like that\", right ladies?! \"Don't be mean to her\", right ladies?! Ladies, she wants you to shut the fuck up and get back in the kitchen! Then she wants you to unzip my fly and start gobbling! That right darling, on your knees you bitch!\n\nMen can only PRETEND to see you for more than what you are in order to comfort your penis envy and avoid the wrath of gynocentrism because they are terrified of being called misogynists and \"not a real man\". Female animals and female flowers don't get to choose what role to play. They get pollenated and impregnated and they reproduce. Then they die. Ther<b> e's noth</b>ing you can do about it. But on the bright side, \"women live longer than men\", right ladies?! Here's the thing... Unlike men, who grow in gravitas and become more prominent <b> with</b> age, women just become dri<b> ed u</b>p old prunes, over the hill turkey necks, and used up semen samplers. So what I'm saying is, you might as well be dea<b> d, y</b>ou old bag!\n\nNot to mention, no amount of <b> money </b>a woman has will<b>  get</b> her sex if a man has no interest in giving her the high hard one. No amount of social engineering will make anything better, it will just make it worse like it's doing right now. \"Where are all the \"real men\", right ladies?! They've become a bunch of submissive, whimpering, feminized beta males. But that still hasn't stopped them from wanting to fuck you DIRECT<b> LY in </b>the pussy! So the feminists haven't managed to change the nature of things because you're still a walking sperm bank. All those idiots managed to do was reduce the masculine qualities in men and delude you into thinking that men are sexually attracted to you for your career and your blabbing and your interests and hobbies and how many \"guy things\" you can do. \n\nLadies... You are the fuck-EES!!!\n\nAnd guys: Since women know so well how much we suck at pickup lines and making small talk, let them be the experts since they're so superior. The n<b> ext ti</b>me a woman tries to chat you up or hit on you, leave her to her own devices and see how good she will do... Not only will she fail, she will become so uncomfortable, it will make you want to slap her for looking so awkward and silly. If men didn't accommodate women by making the first move or by pretending to find them interesting or funny, or by being falsely agreeable, or by downplaying themselves so that women can feel comfortable, or by biting their tongues and suppressing their criticism, women wouldn't get anywhere with men. When women make their moves on men, men give them the impression that they are so cool and interesting, when all men are doing is carefully paying the price of admission.\n\nUnfortunately, that keeps women from improving or having self awareness because women never get to learn from their flaws especially since they never get to see their flaws. And because women are overly sensitive and emotionally retarded children, they won't take well to the criticism because they will take it personally and pay more attention to the words of the critic instead of their own image that the critic is reflecting to them. So the viscous cycle continues, resulting in men conforming and complying and giving women the false idea that their pickup lines and social skills are so savvy and sophisticate<b> d. Men</b> giv<b> e puss</b>y the \"pussy power\". Women only have as much power as men give them.\n\nI said it before, men find out early in life that getting laid requires skill. Women find out later in life that getting a guy to want them <b> for </b>more than sex requires skill. Women just don't have those skills. Women are sperm receptacles, sperm depositories, human toilets. Remember, you had to become who you are in order to be appealing. Women hardly have any merit, all they have is a funky wet hole for the pleasure of your penis. So if you happen to be a man who has his shit together the way women demand you to have your shit together, don't act like a lucky candidate th<b> e firs</b>t time a woman gives you some attention. Actually, try doing this...\n\nWhen a bitch re adds you or comes out of nowhere acting really friendly, before you hit it and quit it, do a background check! She's either been recently dumped, or she recently had a kid, or she recently found out that she's past her expiration date! When she asks you \"what's new\", tell her \"I'm not as broke as I used to be, and you're not as hot as you used to be\"! Her reaction will make your day! Her reaction to Mother Nature should go something like, \"damn nature, you scary!!!... On B.E.T\".",

It looks like my response to the meme made the little ladies a little depressed! Ladies, I thought you were smarter than me and had this thing all figured out already! Ladies, plants grow up, reproduce, then die. Animals do the same. What makes humans any different?! Everything around us is to accommodate and distract us while we reproduce, or engage in the act of reproducing. This is why I want to thank the disney company and all these pop culture icons for turning women into brainless sluts! It's disappointing to know that you ladies haven't given life much thought beyond your glamorous fantasy and fairy tales. No wonder men are happier than women! We understand, and are more than satisfied with life being about eating, drinking, sleeping, pissing, shitting, and having <b> sex!</b> Those are our main needs! All our hobbies and interests are best enjoyed WITHOUT women!\n\nLadies, you're NOT \"one of the guys\"! Ladies, you are the fuck-EES! I can't believe you're just finding this out now! No wonder we're not as depressed as you! Quit thinking that we are your buddies or associates. We pretend that we are your buddies and associates! Ladies, you are merely part of our vital supply kit! We don't talk to our food, we eat our food! We don't talk to our water, we drink our water! We don't talk to our bed, we sleep on it! We don't talk to our toilets, we do our business! So what makes you think we need to talk to you?? Ladies, the only reason we talk to you is because we want to fuck you DIRECTLY in the<b>  pussy</b>! It's amazing how the world sheltered you from this important fact! Ladies, wake up! The whole world is lying to you! Can you not tell?!\n\nLadies... THANK GOD I'M A GUY!!!\n\nWhat was that darling?! \"You think you're gonna become <b> a lesbia</b>n?! Darling, telling me that you're gonna become<b>  a lesbi</b>an because men <b> are p</b>igs and dogs and disgusting creeps and pervs is not having the effect you think it has! It gives me great joy to get a rise out of you, but it makes me soooooooooooo hoooooowny when I imagine you and another angry broad getting it on because of me! Darling, it makes me want to fuck you right in<b>  the p</b>ussy! That's right darling! DIRECTLY i<b> n the </b>pussy! You are a semen sampler! You are a human sperm bank!\n\nLadies, you're not doing me a favour by liking me, and you're certainly not punishing me by disliking me! Darling, I can get chicks that are younger and hotter than you! You are a depreciating asset! Ladies, understand that if you're young and hot, nature already has you covered. You are ripe for the pickings. Your biological objective is to find a guy that fits the bill. So even if you have penis envy or hate your biological nature or want to be seen as more than a walking vagina, the most I can do is feel for you. But it doesn't help to rely on your biological nature when it's convenient, and then bitch about being a walking vagina when you want to be see<b> n as a</b> woman that can do anything a man can do, and do it better, and do it in heels!\n\nI had a bitch who dumped me because she didn't agree with my attitude. \"No surprise\", right ladies?! I'm no stranger to being dumped! But she loved the same thing she dumped me for in the beginning! I guess she thought I was gonna \"change\". <b> Typica</b>l woman! I told her straight up too! I said darling, I had to be an interesting person to you in order for you to acknowledge me. Had you not seen what I was about, you would of never given me the time of day. So I essentially earned you. All you had to do to get my attention was have a vagina. You haven't earned me with anything about yourself. So since simply being male wasn't enough to get you, why should I have to be monogamous to you and continue to work at keeping you when all you expect to do is be female and benefit from the perks of being with me?\n\nFurthermore, if I just wanted to be monogamous, I would just sit around and wait <b> for so</b>me woman to take me as I am. Darling, men want to become successful to live a MAN's dre<b> am, no</b>t a woman's dream! I mean, how self centred do you have to be to think that we're breaking our backs just so that w<b> e ca</b>n have sex with you and only you, and then comply with your demands on top of that?! Darling please! If men could get an abundance of hot chicks by being <b> average</b> joe no<b> body's,</b> then nobody would be working towards success. She had no answer! Well, she had an answer, but it was bleeding with emotion and devoid of logic!\n\nSo for you smarter women who understand how stupid women are, I guess it's safe to say that the safes<b> t plac</b>e for a woman is in the kitchen! That's right darling! Sandwich time! Oh, and you better not burn the toast you bitch! I'm warning you, you cunt!!! One of these days Alice! That's right ladies! Professor Cos WILL send you straight to the moon! \"Words can't describe my hatred for this man\", right ladies?!",

                    "commentText": "Penis Envy... And Why Women Have It\n\nWARNING: THIS ESSAY CONTAINS CHAUVINISM!\n\nHi. I'm Professor Cos. Women seem to think that they can change millions of years of hardwired instincts just by doing everything men do, and then shoving it in men's faces as if that proves something. Yes ladies, you really showed us! You sure taught us a lesson! These <b> dumb </b>little harpies have no idea that all this chauvinism that they're bitching about, is simply the result of them being hoisted by their own petard. Throughout history, all a female had to do, was make her vagina available to the alpha male that she wanted to breed with. Males don't require females to provide for them or their offspring, they are just wired to impregnate females. And in order to be able to gain access to females, men had to have qualities of power and strength. As a result, women never developed themselves into anything interesting beyond being sexually desirable.\n\nIf you look at activities and forms of entertainment that are derived from female creativity, you will notice that almost everything women do to make themselves interesting to men is done either in a<b>  sexual</b> way, or to make themselves the centre of the universe. Men aren't wired to give a fuck about women who emulate the things that men do. So when a bitch is busy trying to show men how interesting she is, men are busy considering their chances of getting her on her knees so she can unzip their fly and start worshipping. Shortly after worshiping a man's penis and ingesting his semen, she will start bitching about how guys are creeps who just wan<b> t se</b>x! This is why I love being a guy!\n\nBecause women are attracted to men that are better than them, they can't help but be led by their hypergamous nature. But not too long after fulfilling their hypergamous objectives, they run into one little problem. You see, because they managed to attract men with their vaginas, or because the men attracted them with their masculine qualities, they quickly realize that they are just decorated sperm depositories that men get to enjoy as a result of developing themselves into attractive individuals. So that of course leaves women feeling inadequate. The same way these women ignore and overlook men they think they're better than, and because women don't understand cause and effect, they fail to realize what will eventually happen when they attempt to bring men down to their level or one up them.\n\nAs soon as a bitch starts bitching abo<b> ut gend</b>er roles and demanding to be an equal, it's time to dropkick the cunt straight through the uprights. Because if you don't, she's gonna continue challenging you until you give in to her nagging and caterwauling and allow her to overpower and control you. And onc<b> e a wo</b>man gets herself in a situation where you're no longer in control, or where she starts to feel like she's better than you, she will start to become bored with you, and, or, lose respect for you. The novelty of you being that powerful man that attracted her to you will be gone once she accomplishes her mission of emasculating you or turning you into a beaten dog. Now that you know women hate themselves, also understand that it's not their fault. Women are just naturally fussy and dysfunctional. Being dominated by an alpha male makes her feel like shit, and dominati<b> ng a beta </b>male makes her feel like shit, so she seeks salvation in \"equality\", but men and women are NOT equals! MAN I LOVE BEING A GUY!\n\nIt's funny, because women like to brag about their xx chromosomes, yet they're just emotionally retarded sperm receptacles, personality disordered sperm depositories, delusional human toilets. This is why your best bet is to either find a N.A.W.A.L.T who is also willing to be submissive so that you're in charge at all times, or stay the fuck out of dodge and go your own way. In fact, should your submi<b> ssive </b>woman get bored, or start to feel bad about being dominated and submitting to your authority, she can still use the power of the law to fuck you up. So all you patriarchs who think you got your bitch under control, you don't. Women are not emotionally stable beings, and women who are always miserable and jumpy about how they deal with being female are not grounds for a stable relationship. Hence the phrase, \"you can't fire a cannon from a canoe\".\n\nSince we are living in a world that accommodates women's irrational and delusional mindsets and actually passes laws to support them, understand that none of that will make women happy. As most of you have already noticed, it has only made women more miserable, not to mention, these laws are driving men away from women, which is making women even more miserabl<b> e. And n</b>othing drives a man away faster than a miserable bitch. Another thing that makes women miserable, is the fact that men are less miserable than them. Have you ever been questioned in a nagging manner about your way of being? For example...\n\nOMG, is that all you guys care about?\nOMG, don't you want more for yourself?\nOMG, doesn't that bother you?\nOMG, do you ever do anything?\nOMG do you ever go out?\nOMG don't you get bored of the same thing?\nOMG, don't you wanna decorate your room?\nOMG, aren't you tired of wearing that shirt?\n\nIt disturbs women to hell and beyond to know that you are not as fussy as they are, and it disturbs them even more to watch you be so content with yourself, knowing very well that they couldn't be as easygoing and fulfilled as you are even if they tried. That's why they're always trying to change you and fix you and adjust you, because like them, they think your life needs improvement or at least deserves to be miserable like theirs. So while they are busy bitching and fussing and complaining and pmsing and cramping and bloating and talking about their feelings, you're as happy as a clam, so long as you're eating, sleeping, pooping, and getting laid. While she's inside gossiping and venting her frustration with the girls, you're outside hunting and fishing with the boys!\n\nWait, what if this truth is too hard for women to swallow? Imagine if it causes women with low self esteem to commit suicide?! That would be too funny! Actually, cancel that! Ladies, please don't go! We need places to deposit our sperm! Ok, fine, give birth to some daughters, then you can kill yourselves. At least we can bang your daughters when they turn 18!",

                    "commentText": "Ladies... You Are The Fuck-EES. (but I have so much more to offer, right ladies?!)\n\nThere's a reason why women weren't generally created as \"brainy\" creatures. After all, even smart women have to try extremely hard to think logically without concluding with emotional rationale! Estrogen is a hell of a force. Try taking testosterone without using estrogen blockers. Before you know it, you'll be growing tits, wearing pink, watching makeover shows, and baking cupcakes. That being said, ladies... I forgive you for being idiots!\n\nHi. I'm Professor Cos. Today ladies, let's have fun! Repeat after me: \"Ummm\"! \"Oookaayy\"! \"Soooo\"! \"Like\", \"OMG\"! Alright, now shut the fuck up and listen!\n\nUmmm, ok, so like, OMG, this bitch is in like her 50's and she just like found out that if a <b> woman </b>doesn't want to like have<b>  sex</b> with a guy like right away, he will just like, bugger off and like look for <b> a woma</b>n who is like interested in like havi<b> ng s</b>ex with him like right away. Like omg really?! Guys <b> are p</b>igs! Well duhh! And she goes on to ask,<b>  \"is</b> sex all I'm good for\"?? Man I love being a guy!\n\nCunt, in terms of biology, women are sperm receptacles, sperm depositories, human toilets. Men are sperm donors. Men are the fuckers. Women are the fuck-ees. So yes darling, take your vagina out of the equation and horny heterosexual men have no reason to talk to you! Guys don't want to sit down over a candle lit dinner and get to know you. Darling please! Maybe after we bang you and we think we like you. The dining and dating is just a time filler to delay the inevitable. That's what guys tell you because you won't understand why he just sees you as a very suitable place to deposit his sperm. What better place for a man to deposit his sperm!\n\nCharging a man a depository fee (be<b> ing </b>a sex worker/needing him to have a good job/needing him to be \"generous\"...blah,blah,blah) makes the fact that women are ideal sperm depositories all the more true! A man's<b>  ideal</b> wom<b> an is </b>a woman that transforms into a six pack and a sandwich once he ejaculates. The only reason why guys get good jobs is to get more places to deposit their sperm. So modern women are technically prostitutes! It's a lot easier to fuck a drunk slut or hood rat hoochie who will do you for free no matter how broke you are! So if you ever find yourself asking: \"why would he cheat on me with that ugly skank\"? The answer is: She got on her knees at the drop of a hat. Actually, her knees hit the ground before the hat! Then she got to gobbling, then she got to guzzling, then he pulled his pants up and went on about his business. No sandwiches were needed that time. Indeed none were served.\n\nSeriously ladies, If a guy wants to hang out and have fun and joke and talk about politics and issues and important stuff, he hangs out with his buddies. A guy doesn't want that from you. So stop trying to be more than what a guy really want<b> s from</b> a woman. A guy wants you to cook him his meals, iron his shirts, and fold his socks. And don't forget to lick and suck anything that he wants to be licked and sucked. Don't wait for him to ask! Oh, and remember to shut the fuck up. Please don't make him have to tell you! He knows just how important your feelings are and how detrimental his honesty is to your \"self esteem\"!\n\nWomen's \"self esteem\" is based on vanity, compliments, and male attention. Women bitch about unwanted male attention and get mad when men just want<b>  the</b>m for sex. Women chase vanity to get compliments and male attention only to get mad when they get male attention or compliments from men that aren't about her \"inner beauty\". \n\nE<b> ver se</b>en a woman in a short tight dress surrounded by guys with her tits hanging out and her lips looking blowjob friendly with the lip liner? She feels \"empowered\" because she has \"self esteem\" from guys who just want to fuck her. But she wants to be respected for her \"inner beauty\" so she does everything in her power to appear smart. She thinks being really bombastic and using a whole lot of \"english\" and trying really hard to be intellectual makes her appear smart! So in her mind she is \"the whole package\"! Yes, she thinks guys are actually going \"wow, she's sexy, and she's smart!\n\nSo everytime she meets men, she tries to be \"better\" \"faster\" and \"smarter\" to prove that she's not just some half naked bitch! She has \"self worth\"! And then she will bitch when a guy doesn't care to look at her from the neck up! Once her lectu<b> res f</b>all on deaf ears and hard dicks she will walk away mumbling \"men are dogs\"! Then she will go to the next guy she meets and tell him about her recent encounter with the \"dogs\" who just wanted to fuck her! That man will play along and pretend to want to have an \"intellectual conversati<b> on\" w</b>ith the dumb bitch and hopefully he will fuck her. Once he fucks her he will go back to being his normal self again res<b> ultin</b>g in the dumb bi<b> tch </b>asking \"is sex all I'm good for\"?! How about we just let them figure it out the hard way! What did the late great Patrice O'neal say?! \" You are the fuck-ee.\n\nRemember ladies, if this is too chauvinistic for you, there are lots of women from other countries who will smile while servicing their men. And this goes especially for you white bitches. Yo<b> u mo</b>therfuckers age 10 times as quick as women from Japan or Thailand or Indonesia. So keep up with the pseudo feminist clap trap! Keep tuning into katie couric's talk show! See how that bitch looks?! I've seen toads with smoother skin! I've seen tree trunks with less crevices! I mean just look at that sagging turkey neck!\n\nHow insensitive of you Professor Cos! Yes ladies, I know!",

                    "commentText": "What Kind Of <b> Woman </b>Did You Dickheads Expect To End Up With?\n\n\n                 Hi. I'm Professor Cos. Among the many places you can find men, you can guarantee to find them in jails, in warehouses, in homeless shelters, in the back alleys smoking crack, or in sleeping bags outside of 7 eleven. Many more of them are in their graves after committing suicide. These were the \"happy wife, happy life\" buffoons, and the Homer Simpson simpletons of the western world.\n\nGuys, if you are living the western lifestyle, you are most likely going to get women who are influenced by the images portrayed in western culture. And you are most likely going to get the worst of the worst. In fact, you buttheads are so brainwashed and naive that you'd be lucky to get a<b>  woman</b> that's even half as decent as the cunts you get fucked over by.\n\nAs a 32 yea<b> r ol</b>d male, I'm disgusted with the lack of dignity and self respect that men have. First, it's almost impossible to meet a group of young men who have anything to talk about that doesn't involve cars, sports, female celebrities, and how much money some other person is making. And when I do meet guys who have interesting things to talk about, they have almost no knowledge of the way women are, and how to deal with women other than the information they got from the media, or from women who tell them what women want. These are the same men you will hear bitching about the way women are, as if they can do any better. These are also the same men who turned themselves into human toilet paper for women to wipe their asses with<b> .\n\nNobo</b>dy is gonna hold your hand and guide you to the ri<b> ght wo</b>man. That's what life skills are for, you thick headed invalids. If you decide to da<b> te a w</b>oman who watches daytime talk shows, reads women's magazines, and is invested in pop culture, don't bitch about her mindset. That's what you signed up for. SO WHAT if she cooks and does your laundry?! And if you or she thinks that the key to a healthy relationship is to simply not be like the \"other bitches\", and that you can just toss your feet up and live in blissful ignorance while she has absolutely no sense of self awareness, you're a disaster waiting to happen to yourself.\n\nIt is YOU who ch<b> ose a </b>woman w<b> ho ha</b>s zero understanding of your perspective and fails to see anything from a man's point of view. And it is YOU who is responsible for it as a result. But like the coward <b> and th</b>e pussy whipped nimrod that you are, you blindly tolerate her irrational state of mind, and accommodate whatever ditsy qualities she has, until there you are pounding your fists on the table because she has no communication skills and no insight whatsoever. Man<b> y of </b>you dumb suckers just won't admit that you are clueless and are at the m<b> ercy o</b>f a woman understanding you, let alone being reasonable with you. You can't trust your good judgement because you have none. And the reason why you have none is because you haven't trained yourself to have any. And the reason why you haven't trained yourself to have any proper judgement is because you've always chosen women with your dick and not your wisdom. Wait, you have no wisdom, and the reason why you have no wisdom is because you're a dickhead.\n\nNow ask yourself... How<b>  does </b>your woman dress? How does she talk? How does she walk? What types of women does she idolize and, or keep company with? What trends does she follow? Is she artificial or is she an individual? What kinds of principles does she have? How does she behave when she's angry? I heard a guy complaining about how irritating his girlfriend is because she is obsessed with 50 shades of grey. How the fuck did he en<b> d up w</b>ith a woman like that in the first place? And how the fuck did he not notice the characteristics associated with the women he isn't interested in? You know why he end<b> ed up </b>with a woman like that? Because water seeks it's own level. You know why he couldn't notice the characteristics prior to get<b> ting w</b>ith the woman? Because he hasn't trained himself<b>  to se</b>e past a woman's physical appearance.\n\nIt also appears to me that men are focusing so much on women that are radical feminists or<b>  wome</b>n that are dumb fucks or sick cunts and are oblivi<b> ous to</b> the \"good woman\". Dummies, the radi<b> cal f</b>eminists and dumb fucks and sick cunts aren't going to stop being rad<b> ical </b>feminists and dumb fucks and sic<b> k cunt</b>s.\n\nThe<b>  \"good</b> woman\" is the woman that <b> needs </b>help. T<b> he \"go</b>od woman\" is the woman that is on a quest for enlightenment. She is desperately searching for answers and clues and \"tips\" and information on how to find a \"real man\" while having no idea that she needs to take a look at herself and accept that men are by nature the <b> way th</b>ey are. The \"good woman\" may be beautiful on the inside, well meaning, and loves men to death, however, her head has been fucked 7 ways<b>  from </b>Sunday.\n\nThe \"good woman\" has no understanding of masculinity because society has fried her brains, thus making her impervious to anything outside of a female perspective. This is why you hear women aggresively throwing questions at men by asking them what men want, in the most passive aggressive manner, while arguing from ignorance about how they think men should think and what they think men should want. Many of these \"good women\" have been brainwashed into thinking that they belong on a pedestal and that a man who kowtows to them is a \"real man\" or a \"tr<b> ue gen</b>tleman\".\n\nThe \"good woman\" doesn't realize that the key to understanding men isn't to ask a bunch of questions about men while expressing her frustration, but instead to be observant, analytical and attentive. And she can't expect to understand anything she learns about men if she's gonna be studying men from a female perspective and then filtering everything about men through her fem<b> ale pe</b>rspective. The \"good woman\" has no idea how she looks or how she is perceived, especially when her inquiries aren't out of curiosity, but out of discontent and disapproval for men, with the hopes that she finds a solution or at least gets some clarity for an issue that she bel<b> ives ste</b>ms from men and has nothing to do with herself. And the worst part about that is, when she finally gets a reflection of herself, she objects to it and takes it personal.\n\nWhen a spineless man who is a naive simpleton doesn't have the knowledge to enlighten these \"good women\" or doesn't have guts to put his foot down and insist on who he is as a man, or doesn't have the self respect to carry himself properly, and instead decides to acquiesce or conform just to keep the \"good women\" happy, or to maintain access into their vaginas, he prevents women from educating themselves about men <b> even mo</b>re. He also turns his gender into walking toilet paper. It's amazing how men can be bashed and publicly disrespected while men sit powerlessly and just deal with it.\n\nI also notice that some of the men who claim to be mgtow, happen to be mgtow as a result of many failed relationships, wether it's from being fucked over by women, or pure frustration. While that's understandable, it makes me wonder what would of happened to these men had their relationships not ended, or had they not been shafted the way they had. I'm guessing that they would of been living in domestic bliss while blindly dealing with the type of women chosen by their own poor judgement. When a man doesn't do his bitch homework on time, he pays the price later on in life. So you recovering mgtow and cynical dickwads can consider your fucked up condition as a rebuilding project instead of becoming levels and stages of mgtow. Purple pill mgtow and level 0 - 4 mgtow sounds fucking ridiculous and pathetic.\n\nNow I could of read this wrong, although I'm sure I read correctly, but if a level 0 mgtow<b>  is<b>  </b</b>>someone who has taken the red pill and seen the world for what it is, but hasn't gone his own way yet, then how the fuck is a man who has gone his<b>  own</b> way already, but still has sex with women or dates women considered a purple pill mgtow? So far life has been dealing with you and it hasn't dealt you anything good. Fucktards, it's time to stop bitching about life and start dealing with it. <b> Everyt</b>ime you bitch about what a woman did to you, you are giving bitches more power. If you weren't a fucking idiot, and actually had self respect and self awareness, none of what happened to you would of ever come close to happening to you. Let's face it, you let it happen to you. Boo hoo.\n\nNow I am simply a man who has opted out and refuses to play the game of conforming to society and being a human doing. But I came to that conclusion AFTER contemplating and questioning my reasoning as well as the mindsets of the women I was observing. That means I became a mgtow before mgtow became me, and before I got burned by some bitch. In other words, I did my bitch homework. And if you guys think I'm pulling rank on you, well maybe I am, and maybe I should. UFC fighter Conor McGregor said: \"in times of stress, the weak get together\". I didn't become a mgtow to seek salvation or be part of a club or \"brotherhood\". It's one thing to share similar values and principles, and it's another thing to share a cult like ideology. This is what I see the feminists doing, and this is what I see mgtow doing. I'm just calling it like I see it.\n\nRemember, Professor Cos doesn't sugar coat shit, he shit coats shit. Meaning, he makes the truth sound as harsh and as inconvenient as he can. And the way he sees it, a lot of you guys are full of shit.",

                    "commentText": "Why Men Pay The Bigger Price Of Admission... Then Bitch About it\n\nHi. I'm Professor Cos. A man will become somebody in order to qualify for a <b> woman </b>who demands him to be somebody in order to be with her, while he just needs her to look good, have<b>  sex</b> with him, and cater to his ego. Then without realizing how stupid he is, he will be expected to be monogamous to thi<b> s woma</b>n who now no longer needs to look good, ha<b> ve s</b>ex with him, or cater to his ego, now that he's locked in a contract. So he becomes a slave who must continue to be the man that he's expected to be, while tolerating whatever type of treatment he gets, and complying with whatever demands are made.\n\nThat same man will bitch about being nagged and treated like an ATM even though he volunteered for the position by being a brain dead, dick thinking simpleton that bases his masculinity on female approval and fulfilling his societal obligation.\n\nBecause a man hardly uses his brain when it comes to dealing with women, he doesn't realize that his dick and his ego are preventing him from realizing that he's just a 2 legged mule that has been deluded into thinking he's a hero or a \"family man\" for being a 2 legged mule. His desperate need for being looked at as a man that women admire, and as a man that is strong and capable, will weaken his spine and drain him of his dignity. A man sees gettin<b> g a wo</b>man as an accomplishment, while the ego boost he gets will prevent him from seeing that he had to do all the work to get <b> this w</b>oman. He doesn't respect himself enough to see that all he's doing is earning the privilege of being with someone who expects to benefit from being with him, while demanding him to live by her rules and be financially responsible for her after they breakup.\n\nThat same man will bitch abou<b> t his </b>woman being unreasonable and irrational even though he was stupid enough to not realize that living by the \"happy wife, happy life\" code, and \"picking his battles\" meant that he was <b> with a</b> woman who was emotionally retarded.\n\nWhile it's part of human nature for men to be attracted to fertility and to think with their dicks, and for women to be attracted to power and strength, men don't hold themselves to any standards as far as self respect. Actually, a man will create his standards based on<b>  what </b>a woman considers attractive. So he will earn money and create a lifestyle that attracts women, only to have it co opted by women. He will put so much value in the outcome of his effo<b> rts, </b>and zero regard for the fact that he is paying the price of admission. See, <b> even i</b>f a woman has her own money, she still expects a guy to either have more money than her, or at least jump through some hoops. Unlik<b> e a ma</b>n, a woman is hardly satisfied with a person who is good l<b> ooki</b>ng, has sex with her, and caters to her ego. Keep in mind that I'm talking about general prerequisites here, not specific details.\n\nBeing good loo<b> king</b>, having sex with someone, and catering to them, are not skills that you have to spend years developing, they are just things that you're born with and things than you can simply do. So when a man spends the first half of his life creating himself into someone just to be eligible to be with someone who just had to be born good looking enough to be eligible to be with him, it's almost impossible for me to feel sorry for him when I see the knucklehead spending the second half of his life being destroyed by the person he saw himself as a lucky candidate for. The poor stupid fuck was so eager to do whatever it is he heard women say they were turned on by.\n\nThat same man will bitch about why women wouldn't talk to him when he was an average joe, but he will give those same women power over him by allowing them t<b> o trea</b>t their pussy as a prize that's more valuable than his prize, which is the man he developed himself into and the things he accomplished.\n\nSee, I don't have a beef with women who are gold diggers, and I don't have a beef with men who just want women for their looks. I actually think those two things compliment each other...\n\nNot only do I think gold digging is somewhat cute, it makes us men look more powerful than we deserve to look. Bes<b> ides</b>, when I'm old, I'm gonna need women to be hypergamous and gold diggers. It's a power that we have that women don't. I have a beef with women who don't educate themselves about the biological nature of men, while having no self awareness, while bitching about the same thing they're counting on men to be. And I have a much bigger beef with men who allow themselves to be manipulat<b> ed and</b> ruled by pussy without paying attention to the impact that it has on their dignity, then bitch about the same women who they were trying to impress.\n\nWhen a man works on his quality of life <b> to qua</b>lify for a woman, he fails to see her lack of consideration because he's too busy considering his dick. So when he starts bitching about his bitch, he doesn't consider the fact that he allowed himself to be conformed to the mindset of the inconsiderate bitch that he's bitching about.",

                    "commentText": "Why Do Women Feel Used After One Night Stands, But Men Don't?\n\nHi. I'm Professor Cos. As you may or may not know, a female's primal function is to serve as a sperm depository for the production of new life. And in order for a female to naturally reproduce with a male, she must submit and allow herself to be penetrated, thereby making her the fuck-ee! Now, is there anything dehumanizing about that? Well, put it this way, I prefer to be on top! However, something about the reality of a female's biological role doesn't seem to sit quite right with the wimmins! Being the insensitive troll that I am, I plan to get to the very bottom of this in the most chauvinistic manner possible! MAN I LOVE BEING A CHAUVINISTIC PIG!!!\n\nBecause women don't spend much time analyzing the reality of nature, thanks to disney, and hollywoood, and in touch weekly, and entertainment tonight, and glamour, and cosmopolitan, and the oscars, and the emmy's, and the golden globes, and female talk shows, and fashion, and shopping, and shoes, and hair, and makeup, and much much more, they tend to live life in their imagination and through their emotions. As a result of living life as mindless dingbats and emotionally retarded women babies with golden uterus syndrome, women end up becoming emotionally superior and more spiritual than men!\n\nSince women are under the impression that men choose mates the way they do, they become deluded into thinking that they're perceived by men as \"one of the guys\", while being a beautiful, superior, sacred lady that can \"create life\", that a man must bow and scrape to. Then when they begin noticing that men and women are perceived differently, they become terribly disenchanted and start expressing their displeasure for the reality that they perceive as chauvinism! What's more, they get in touch with their \"inner beauty\" and start demanding men to see women as equals and to want women for more than <b> sex!</b>\n\nWait a minute... I have a few questions!!\n\nIf women are so superior, then why would they feel the need to be acknowledged by their subordinates as equal to them? If anything, it should be the other way around! But it isn't the other way around! If women are good for so much more than<b>  sex</b>, then why do they have to demand men to want more tha<b> n se</b>x? Men wanting more th<b> an s</b>ex should be a given, don't you think? Furthermore, the problem with men only wanting \"one thing\" would of never existed! So why do women feel violated by men who just h<b> ave </b>sex with them and leave? Stay tuned as I answer my own questions!\n\nYou see, when women first become aware of their biological function, they get carried away after developing a severe case of golden uterus syndrome, which prevents them from understanding the male biological function. The male biological function not only gives women a hard dose of reality, no pun intended, but it causes women to see their female biological function in a different light, meaning, without their false sense of preeminence and inflated sense of divinity. That's when you hear women trying to shame men out of their natural instincts by calling them animals and a bunch of primal, primitive blah blah blah, which we are by the way, and very happy to be!\n\nIt's pretty obvious that these miserable bitches don't have a problem with \"primal instincts\", because they exercise their female primal instincts religiously. They have a problem with the male primal instinct, because the male primal instinct is what prevents women from being \"one of the guys\"! As you know, women are devoid of logical thinking, therefore they can't even see that they're counting on the very male primal instinct that they're bitching about, to be in full working order! The female primal instinct is to go after power and strength for her own self interests. In addition, women are fascinated by the interesting people that men have to develop themselves into in order to exercise their male primal instincts.\n\nSimply put, men get to look cool while depositing their sperm, and women just get to be sperm receptacles, sperm depositories, human toilets! MAN I LOVE BEING A GUY! Upon learning that the male primal instinct is to deposit sperm, women realize that they're pretty much just good for \"one thing\" which is why men initially just want \"one thing\", which is why women get so upset when men aren't fascinated by their accolades! As much as women frown on the male primal instinct, they still want to benefit from it so that they can fulfil their hypergamous instinct and receive chivalry and get laid whenever they want. They just want the male primal instinct to be modified so that women can be princesses without being human toilets!\n\nDid I just hear some muttering?! \"This is proof that we still need feminism\" right ladies?! Ladies, thank god I don't need feminism! Blessed are you lord, our god, ruler of the universe, who has not made <b> me a w</b>oman!",

                    "commentText": "Why Do Women Feel Used After One Night Stands, But Men Don't? Pt. 2\n\nHi. I'm Professor Cos. It's not hard to see that women want to use men without being used. But it's impossible for a <b> woman </b>to use a man without his male primal instinct reminding her that she's a sperm depository! So even if she manages to use a man for his money or any other resources, she was counting on his male primal instinct, which makes him see her as a sperm depository! Should a<b>  woman</b> decide to prostitute herself or have a one night stand, she can only do so if the man sees her as a sperm depository! A man can't really be used fo<b> r se</b>x, and even if<b>  a wom</b>an thinks that all some man is good for is his dick, his male primal instinct is what causes him to reciprocate by hav<b> ing </b>sex with her, which means he most likely just sees her as a sperm depository!\n\nBy using the word \"used\", one is implying that whatever they're being used for is their prize possession. Women can be used for their money by some mooch, and they can also be used<b>  for</b> sex. Men can just be used for their money. Imag<b> ine a </b>woman knowing that you got with her just to bang her and spend her money. That would be a double whammy! Unless a man is delusional, he knows he's being used for his money, but he's ok, so long as he's getting to fuck her right <b> in the</b> pussy. By banging the bitch, he isn't giving anything away except money, which ma<b> kes th</b>e woman he's with a prostitute. She's getting his money, but she's being <b> used</b> for sex. Now <b> imagin</b>e a woman getting with a man because he has money, then ends up spreading her legs and never gets any money. She will feel like she got something taken away from her.\n\nSo what exact<b> ly mak</b>es a woman feel this way?\n\nLet's say a fish ate your bait without biting your hook. That fish doesn't want to be with you, that fish doesn't care about you, that fish just wants your bait. Likewise, you don't care about the fish, you're not really trying to feed the fish, you just want t<b> o eat </b>it. A woman's primal instinct is to use her vagina as bait to hook a man into comm<b> itment</b>. That woman doesn't care about <b> the ma</b>n, that woman doesn't <b> care</b> about his sex life, she just needs to fulfil her biological objective. By the same token, that man doesn't care about her, nor does he give a rat's ass about her financial situation, he just wants some tail. When that man ejaculates and goes on about his merry way without paying any money or getting her pregnant, he gets the bait without getting hooked, which leaves her feeling used, even though she was trying to use him! This is why women try to redeem themselves by falsely accusing men of rape.\n\nWomen manipulate men into relationships they don't want to be in by using their vaginas, which is the only thing they're good for. Willing participants don't need to be manipulated, so the fact that women have to manipulate men should tel<b> l you </b>enough. A woman feels entitled to compensation after a breakup because she's parting with a man<b>  who</b> got to have sex with her in a relationship that didn't work out in her favour. Instead of admitting that she hates the idea of a man getting away with all that free vagina while she has to go look for another sucker, she rationalizes by saying things like, \"I spent time taking care of his kids or tolerating his crap\". Sure! Assuming that's the truth, what makes her think that her crap wasn't being tolerated, and who afforded her the privilege of being able to stay at home and take care of kids?\n\nLet's just tell it like it is, women are whores and they feel like every male encounter that doesn't pay off is money they could have made from some other sucker. Have you noticed how angry women get when they date a guy for so long and he doesn't propose, or his potential doesn't pay off? This is also why women claim to want to get to know a <b> guy </b>before having sex with him. Listen, women don't want to get to know jack shit, because women spend no time hopping into the sack with men that they think can provide them with commitment and security. They won't spend time getting to know him, they will spend time investing in his co<b> mmit</b>ment by having se<b> x with</b> him. So if a woman is genuinely interested in spending time getting to know a guy, she's either a prude, or she just hasn't foun<b> d an</b>y reason to have sex with him.\n\nThat r<b> eminds</b> me, whenever a woman tries to hangout with a guy on a platonic level, or acts like her company is worth a million bucks, the guy tend<b> s to c</b>omplain that the woman is treating his time like i<b> t has </b>no value. But the woman isn't actually treating his time like it has no value, she is interested in hanging out with him, and is under the impression that he is just as thrilled to be in her company as she is to be in his. But a man's vagina is his time. Women can enjoy spending time with men the same way men enjoy spending time with men, but men don't find women interesting enough to just want to hang. A man's purpose of be<b> coming</b> acquainted with a woman is to bang. This is why men should be prostitutes and charge women for conversation.\n\nHave you also noticed that when women are trying so hard to prove how interesting and worthy they are, they're actually admitting that masculinity is the standard to strive for? By trying to prove that they can be just like men, they're conceding that masculinity and masculine qualities are seen as more interesting than femininity and feminine qualities. And they're absolutely right! Everything that's cool was created from masculinity, which makes men attractive and fun. Femininity is just something to give men an erection and get us aroused so we could fulfil our primal instincts! So as much as women like to celebrate their femininity and bitch about toxic masculinity, they know that femininity doesn't have that edge that masculinity has, and so they aspire to be more like men, or they try to force femininity down men's throats. But there's only one thing getting in the way, and that is human biology!\n\nLadies... YOU ARE THE FUCK-EES... YOU ARE THE FUCK-EES... YOU ARE THE FUCK-EES!!!",

Ladies, if you build something strong enough to work for you and against others, what the fuck makes you think that that same power won't be a force to reckon with when you try to work against it! If I build a brick wall to prevent you from entering my yard, it will also prevent me from entering your yard! LOL logic ladies, LOGIC!!! Women think feminism is something they can just \"stop wanting\", and that it will just go away simply because they stop wanting it! Dummies, if it was that easy to destroy feminism, then feminism would have never been able to destroy men!\n\nThese gynocentric female men's rights activists are trying to \"fight\" feminism. Yea, they're gonna need the luck of every single Irish with a horseshoe up their ass. And with all that luck, they might only be able to get through to some open minded female students or get some feminist housewives to stop calling themselves feminists. In other words, they're not fighting \"feminism\" in a million years! The same feminists that these women are trying to \"fight\" are the same feminists that these women allowed themselves to unfairly benefit from. These are the feminist lawyers and judges and politicians that gave women their social advantages over men. Ladies, these are the feminists that will ensure that your sons get ripped off in divorce court and get falsely accused of rape and lose access to their kids.\n\nWhat's even more disgusting, is that many of you harlots are not even bitching about how unfair feminism has been towards men, you're bitching about how it's affecting your own lifestyle and happiness as a <b> woman!</b> Knowing your own nature as a<b>  woman</b>, were you really expecting feminism to end as soon as women got equal rights? Knowing your own nature, you should have known that women are NEVER satisfied! Women will ALWAYS think that they don't have enough rights! As a proud feminist, I think women still need feminism!\n\nI don't want feminism to go away, I want women to get a taste of their own medicine. I don't want women to be independent, I want women to depend on feminism. I don't want women to have equality, I want women to be privileged to their own detriment. I don't want women to act like adults and be reasonable and considerate, I want women to cuntinue being infantilized and cuntinue being selfish, emotionally retarded snack pack throwers. They had no problem benefitting at the expense of men, and now they're paying the price. It's affecting women's dating lives as well as producing more personality disordered campus feminists. And I couldn't be more proud of the results!\n\nWhat can I say, I get great joy out of watching women self destruct. As dangerous as feminism and gynocentrism is for men, I want women, especially the women who showed no concern for men, to watch helplessly as their sons, brothers, fathers, grandfathers, uncles, and any other men they care about get destroyed by the system they supported with their own self interest. I won't be surprised if the current backlash escalates to the point where blood gets spilled and women start getting randomly murdered.\n\nBtw, have you noticed that women have become both wage and domestic slaves? As I was pacing around the kitchen one morning waiting for some water to boil, I started thinking about all these western women that are trying so hard to compete with men to appear superior, be like men to feel empowered, emasculate men to comfort their penis envy, and bash men to express their displeasure. Then I thought to myself, I'm a man! I was born male! I'm one of the chosen ones! Right now some miserabl<b> e woma</b>n who makes 10 times the amount of money I make is boiling her water getting ready to go compete with men, and I'm about to unzip my fly and whip out my dick without a care in the world!\n\nAs I like to say, you bitches have been hoisted by your own petard! You made your bed, now be quiet! It's bed time!",

These <b> dumb </b>bitches are oblivious to the fact that they are turning into<b>  frog</b> soup. They are so involved in th<b> e woma</b>n world and stuck in their state of delusion and entitlement that they have no idea what is actually working from the inside out. But it's perfect synergy if you think about it!\n\nHi. I'm Professor Cos. Every day I hear a bunch of aging broads who missed the boat saying that they can't find a \"real man\" or get a man to \"commit\". Ladies, you can find them at any one of the following locations... Family court, divorce court, jail, homeless shelters, or on a yacht with some hot 23 year olds. These women still think they have options like a 21 ye<b> ar o</b<b> >ld ch</b>ick and are complaining about broke guys and guys who only want \"one thing\"... As if they can do much better than that! They have no idea that they're swimming with the other frogs in water that's slowly starting to boil. \"Women against feminism\" is an example of the frogs jumping for dear life to escape the covered pot of hot water. I can't wait to see how this is gonna play out!\n\nGuys, if you're wi<b> th a w</b>oman that thinks men should be \"gentlemen\"... D.T.B.. DUMP THAT BITCH. And the reason I don't take women on \"dates\" is because I generally just bang hoodrats and babymothers and nymphomaniacs and skanks. In fact, every bitch I bang thinks I'm funny and cool and smart and likes how witty I am.\n\nHere's my attitude... My company is more valuable t<b> han a </b>woman's company because I jus<b> t ne</b>ed sex from her and she enjoys a lot more th<b> an j</b>ust sex from me. Plus she actuall<b> y en</b>joys sex from me more tha<b> n I </b>enjoy sex from her! I don't find her funny or cool or interesting or \"amazing\" the way chicks find interesting guys. An i<b> nteres</b>ting woman to<b>  a man</b> is a woman that comes equipped with a remote control that has a transform button, a mute button, a food and beverage button, a multiply button, a multitask button, and a timeout button. A transform button for when he wants to turn her in<b> to a y</b>ounger woman <b> when</b> she gets old, or into a new bitch when he's tired of ba<b> ngin</b>g the same old broad, or into a big screen when he wants to watch the game... A mute button for when he wants her to shut the fuck up... A food and beverage button that automatically puts her to work in the kitchen... A multiply button that can turn her into multiple bitches... A multitask button for when he wants her to iron his shirts, make his breakfast and give him his morning blow job all at once, and a timeout button for when he wants the bitch out of the house.\n\nYou got all these \"cool girls\" trying to talk to us and become \"one of the guys\" and get involved in all the cool shit guys are doing. And most guys are just doing women favours by listening to their boring stories and pretending to be good listeners<b> . So g</b>uys, if a woman wants to spend time with you that<b>  doe</b>sn't involve sex, she has to pay! Bottom line. I'm a guy! I have all the swagger and charisma that she enjoys. And I'm obviously smarter than most women. Plus I don<b> 't eve</b>r look at a woman and go, \"man\"! \"I like her style\"! I wish I was just like her! Gu<b> ys don</b>'t look at a woman and go \"I want to be like her one d<b> ay\". G</b>uys look at a woman and go \"I want to bang her one day\". Plus as a man, my value and importance g<b> oes up</b> in society. A woman's value goes down.\n\nDid I forget to mention the abortion button?\n\nUnfortunately, the remote control doesn't come with an abortion button, but should you get your bitch pregnant, there is an inflate button that will blow her up till she explodes and splatters all over the place! So be sure to cover the walls with plastic. Even though you managed to prevent the bitch from having your baby, the downside is you're gonna have to order a new bitch because the remote control will not be able to transform your exploded bitch into multiple bitches to clean up the mess. I'm sure the Japanese can invent this device! Remember... Japanese men are also going their own way!",

                    "commentText": "Advice For Women Who Want To Find The Right Guy Before Having <b> Sex\n</b>\nHi. I'm Professor Cos. There is a very good chance that whoever is reading this, is a misguided, misinformed, delusional western<b>  woman</b> who thinks that the world revolves around her emotional sense of reality. Now I'm not saying that I expect you to take any responsibility for your ignorance and lack of consideration for anything that isn't your female perspective, I'm just saying that I understand why you're in the situation you're currently in, and why you're so cynical and disgruntled. Since your self help gurus and dating coaches didn't do fuck all about your situation, except take your money, boost your sense of entitlement, and leave you even more out of touch with reality, Professor Cos has decided to step in and save the day. So before I get too carried away laughing at how much of a dumbass you are, let's get this thing underway.\n\nShould you be a non religiou<b> s woma</b>n that's planning to wait until your wedding night, or at least wait for the \"right man\" to \"come along\" before you decide to put out, you are most likely in one of two categories...\n\nYou're a naive virgin who has no clue about men or the environment that you're currently living in, and you're hoping for some magical Prince Charming to sweep you off your feet and take you to a far, far away land where you will be a princess and live happily ever after.\n\nOr, you're<b>  a wom</b>an who has \"had her fun\", meaning you've <b> had </b>sex with many different men and you're deciding to make some new rules for <b> your</b> old, used up cooch.\n\nTo the women who see themselves in the first category, I have some late news for you. The little boys that you think you're so much more mature than have become men. In other words, it's your turn to grow up. For many of you, growing up might mean trying really hard to sound intellectual and using a bunch of unneccesary big words. But that's usually a cover up for how clueless and immature you are. The little boys who are still little boys that you're still complaining about are the only p<b> eople</b> dumb enough to expect you to be good for anything more than a blowjob in the parking lot.\n\nIf you're a non rel<b> igious</b> woman expecting a non religious man to wait until you decide that he's the \"right guy\", you're gonna have a hard time finding someone to take you seriously. Because you never bothered to stop and study the reality of your situation, when you finally came to terms with it, your first reaction to reality was to dismiss it, argue with it, then express your disaproval for it. Your way of dealing with being disillusioned was to try and re delude yourself by insisting on waiting for a man that you think all men should be like to show up and <b> put </b>his sex life on hold until further notice from you, and without noticing how your ignorant idea of what every man should be looks to every man.\n\nWhen you start spewing your pipe dream fantasy to a grown man, the first thing he notices about you, other than your looks and your expectations, is how selfish you are, and how much of an unreasonable pain in the ass you're likely to be. If <b> you have</b> nothing going for yourself other than your idea of a perfect relationship that requires a man to be your emotional tampon who understands you, and \"gets you\", and listens to you, and does things your way, while you remain oblivious to anything about him, or his needs, or his perspective, here are some words to live by... \"You get out what you put in\".\n\nFor you women who fit into the second category, here's the deal, the only people you're fooling, are the naive nerds that you're not interested in. You don't give a fuck about the values you claim to have, you just <b> know</b> that sex is what guys want, and you can't seem to find anyone who is interested in more than a quick pump and dump. So your clever way of dealing with your misery is to pretend that you're waiting until your wedding night, or until you decide that he's the \"right guy\". The problem isn't the men who just wa<b> nt t</b>o have sex with you, and just so you know, many of the <b> men </b>you had sex with were the \"right guy\", but they just wa<b> nted</b> to have sex with you... Haha! I wonder why!\n\nMaking a man wait until you d<b> ecid</b>e to have sex with him isn't gonna solve your problem, because the p<b> robl</b>em is that sex is all you're good for. Bitch, listen cunt, the kind of guy who is willing to wait until your wedding night is the kind of guy who believes in god, and that he punishes those who <b> have</b> premarital sex. You a<b> re not</b> the right woman for that guy. You are a<b> lso no</b>t the right woman for the \"right guy\", because the \"right guy\" can see right through your dishonest tactic. The \"right guy\" also understands why you're in the condition that you're in, and he's laughing at you from a distance. Using manipulation will only end you up with naive suckers, or men who will really wait as long as it takes to bone you while boning other bitches in the mean time.\n\nWhen you start complaining <b> that</b> men just want sex and aren't noticing how interesting and intelligent you are, you're giving away quick information about yourself, and it's information that suggests that you're not as interesting and intelligent as you say you are. If you were as interesting and intelligent as you say you are, you would not be bitching about reality, because you would understand it, and you would understand that bitching about reality doesn't make you look interesting or intelligent.\n\nThe same way male animals look at female animals as mating material is the same way men look at women as mating materi<b> al. </b>You are walking sex! You are the fuck-ee! You are a sperm receptacle, a sperm depository, a human toilet. You can bitch about it till the cows come home. You can be as disgusted as you want, but it's hard wired biology. Btw, you can't count on something and bitch about it at th<b> e sa</b>me time. You use sex as a loss leader but bitc<b> h ab</b>out guys who want sex ri<b> ght awa</b>y. You become a hooker, an escort, or a cam girl, but b<b> itch</b> about men who want sex right away. You complain about creeps and pervs, but you \"dress for tips\". Dummy, if men weren't cheaters or creeps<b>  or </b>pervs or didn't want sex right away you wouldn't be in business, and you wouldn't be getting any male attention.\n\nIn closing, I wanna give a salut to all the pastors who colle<b> ct the</b> 10% and the \"first fruit\" from these delusional doorknobs. These women think offering their entire pay check and then 10% of their earnings will make god send them their perfect man because making a cash deposit is an investment in GOD!\n\nGod, if you're reading this, why are you taking so long to grant women their prince charmings? Also tell me, why did you create women so stupid and emotionally retarded? Thanks for choosing for me to be born male instead of female! I dodged a major bullet!",

                    "commentText": "But Women Created The Men That Invented Everything, Right Ladies?!\n\n                An angry feminist who has a degree in women's studies tried to humble me with her logical fallacies and false information. I must admit, I could feel both my intelligence and masculinity being threatened by a strong powerful feminist who doesn't need a man and is out to destroy the <b> patriarchy!</b> But instead of trying to entertain you with my<b>  lame</b> sarcasm, how about I give you what you enjoy from me the most, which is my exploitation of the stupidity of th<b> e dum</b>b bitches that try to argue with me. And for those of you who were guessing who th<b> is wom</b>an was... No, it wasn't Jessica Valenti. Actually, I left this poor lit<b> tle femin</b>azi bathing in female tears! Here's how it went:\n\nHi. I'm Professor Cos. Darling please! It's really not that hard to put your left leg by the 12 and your right leg by the 3. Plus as you should know, women are more flexible than men, right ladies?! Now, in an attempt to create the men who created the things that exist in this world, a man had to do all the humping and pumping while you layed there as stiff as a board. \"Why does r<b> ough</b> sex always have to be portrayed as the man dominatin<b> g the </b>woman\", right ladies?! Dummy, because no matter what position you're in, you're the one on the receiving end of the dick. You're the one getting fucked. You are the fuck-ee!\n\nAnd men who built and invented things did so on their own merit, not by simply being squirted throug<b> h some</b> woman's bloody cunt. So expecting men to give women credit for things men invented is like blaming women for all the rapists and serial killers who came out <b> of som</b>e woman's vaginal crack 9 months after some guy came i<b> nto so</b>me woman's vaginal crack. I can give credit to the food, water, air, and bed that I slept in that kept me alive and energized, but it was my work that created the outcome of my efforts, not some human toilet. Btw, I gotta thank all the men who work in the sewers as well as the plumbers who provide me with a place to shit. And I must not forget to give a shout out to all the human toilets, who over the years provided me with a place to deposit my sperm. \n\nNow you can bitch about how unfair it is that only women get periods, and only women carry the burden of pregnancy for 9 months... \"I wish men could have periods and feel the pain of childbirth\", right ladies?! Then you can brag about how superior you are to men because men can't make babies. Women are the givers of life, right ladies?! Bitch, it's not a man's fault or problem that biology is the way it<b>  is. Bt</b>w, nobody forced you to have babies. And I would pray for you to stop bleeding every month to minimize the bitching every month, but since women are more spiritual than men, there's a very good chance that god will answer your prayer instead of mine, because unlike you, I'm so inferior. So get on your knees.\n\nI can't bang you on your period, and keeping your mouth occupied helps to suppress the bitching. So get on your knees.\n\nFlorence Parpart did not invent the refrigerator. In what women's studies class did you hear that baloney? There's a reason why I call women's studies \"women's bullshit\". Maybe if you studied science instead of women's studies you would of been able to create something of your own. And I'm not taking credit for what men invented, you are the one that's taking credit for what women invented, so you'd be the pot cussing the kettle even if I was taking credit for men's inventions. The fact that you have to squeeze out a list of things women invented just to shove it in a man's face is childish and pathetic and shows how desperate you are to get revenge on masculinity.\n\nImagine taking a small basket of your home grown vegetables to the farmer's market to shove it in the faces of people who have truckloads of produce. Well that's how much of an idiot you women look like! Comparing Marie Curie to the drunk slob at the football game, or the dope in the tv commercial or sitcom, to prove that women are smarter than men is ridiculous. Men don't need to compare Albert Einstein to Jessica Simpson or Britney Spears to prove that men are more logical than women. So your tactic in itself, which btw<b>  is a v</b>ery common way for women to argue shows just how petty and stupid <b> the av</b>erage woman is.\n\nKeep in mind that the more you exercise your penis envy in an attempt to bring men down, the more massive and powerful you're making men out to be. You don't have a problem with chauvinism, because you clap your hands and celebrate when you hear statements like \"women are smarter than men\" and \"women can do anything a man can do, and do it better, and do it in heels\". When women get called out on their bullshit and corrected with facts about men that prove otherwise, women flash the chauvinism card and try to counter the facts about men with women's bullshit in a desperate attempt to feed men humble pie. In other words, you just wish reality could tone itself down. Guess what sweety, it won't!\n\nSince reality won't tone itself down, and because your feelings of insecurity, inadequacy and jealousy, and especially your \"feelings\" won't allow you to accept who you are as a female, I have decided to stimulate your penis envy with some chauvinism of my own<b> . Assu</b>ming a woman did in fact invent the sticky note pad, (even thought we both know it was Arthur fry and Spencer Silver) it would be to write a \"honey do list\" of things for a man to do, then stick it on to a fridge that a man invented! So honey, while I go and take care of the \"honey do list\", how about you iron my shirts, fold my socks, and then get back into the kitchen where you belong!",

                    "commentText": "Women Have Shot Their Prospects in the Foot and They Can't Understand Why They're Limping!\n\nHi. I'm Professor Cos. Ladies, if you have already ovular merged, or should you be seeing this message post ovular merging, this message is outdated. You must destroy and discard this message immediately!!! How you managed to have the technology to see this message when men are no longer around to update it is a question that I'm sure all of us would have. But because we're not around to hear an answer, we'll just assume it's because a <b> woman </b>can do anything a man can do, and do it better, and do it in heels. Better yet, it's because a<b>  woman</b> needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle! I'm an able bodied man and I still need men to survive. So when I hear you cunts say that women don't need men, it'<b> s nothin</b>g short of comical.\n\nMen made it possible for women to say \"women don't need men\". In other words, women need men in order to not need men. Even the dildos that you bitches are fucking yourselves with are made by men.\n\nI just saw 3 petroleum trucks and they were all being driven by men... On roads built by men. It's funny how women ask questions like \"what's gonna happen to society if all men stop getting married and having kids?\" without asking themselves \"what would happen if all women have careers and no longer need men?\". This just goes to show you that male disposability and keeping women in the kitchen barefoot and pregnant is the cruel way to keep civilization going. Liberating men and women weakens civilization. Civilization is not natural, it's man made. Btw, I'm gonna stop maintaining my man made place so that I can liberate the grass and trees and let the vines run amok.\n\nMgtow and feminism is the result of our natural response to being enslaved to a man made system. It's amazing how the truth always gets revealed! Nature always takes over!\n\nWomen combat this issue by demanding men to comply with solipsistic women who want men to pay the bigger price of admission, do half of the housework, make most of the money, pay most of the bills, think and act like women, and treat hormonal, emotionally retarded child women like equals. They must also tolerate being in a sexless marriage that results in short hair, weight gain, bad communication like silent treatment, emotional reasoning, disrespect, nagging and haranguing. Then when it's all said and done, they can expect to be stripped of their property, separated from their kids and ordered to pay alimony. And  someone thought giving women the right to vote was a good idea!\n\nSo men are simply opting out and going their own way... To which women respond \"but what's gonna happen to society?\". Ladies, I thought \"ovular merging\" (discovered by a male scientist) meant you don't need men? \n\nI mentioned before that monogamy and marriage was designed to prevent us from breeding like the animals that we are. Women want to be able to comply with their primitive instincts without considering the results. In other words, they want to bitch about men who correspond with their own primitive instincts while relying on those very male primitive instincts, then they want women to be liberated from their role of being responsible for the aftermath of complying with their female primitive instincts. What's more, women want to destroy the system that they must cooperate with in order for their offspring to have fathers. And by being raised without fathers, humans tend to become uncivilized animals.\n\nAs a result of this destruction, we have fatherless personality disordered women getting knocked up by fatherless hooligans, and the rest of them asking where all the good men have gone. No one ever said foresight was a female attribute!\n\nIt seems to me that women took t<b> he <b> r</b</b>>ed pill before men did, but in a really fucked up way. You see, unlike men, who finally became disillusioned after getting screwed by the system, women were just fed a different form of bullshit. The same way women were incentivized into being enslaved into a system that stripped them of their liberty, they were coaxed out of it by the notion that they were oppressed. Not only do they have the wrong idea of the oppression that they were under, they don't realize that they were lured into the oppression by their own self interests, at men's disposability.\n\nSo as you can see, women only know how to bitch and complain without considering others, without solving problems, and without looking at the big picture. Simply put, women are children. If they talk, tell them to be silent. If they keep grumbling, use your penis as a pacifier.\n\nNot only have women still not become disillusioned to the system they were lured into, they are now in a situation where they have no choice but to become \"empowered\" women who don't need men. They can either become \"empowered\" career women who struggle to find \"eligible bachelors\" (thanks to the system that made it possible for women to become \"empowered\" career women at the expense of the bachelors) or they can have kids without fathers and have their bastards supported by the welfare system supported by blue collar men and \"empowered\" career women's tax dollars. Now it makes perfect sense why women were given the right to vote!\n\nI mean it's perfect synergy! Women are being transformed into a new system supported by men and occupied by women who are supported by women's programs payed for by blue collar men, while bitching that men aren't helping them, or that they can't find any worthy prospects.\n\nSomething is telling me that this is NOT what women asked for! Wait a minute... This is exactly what they asked for, didn't they? Ok, maybe they had other results in mind! Or maybe they didn't! Aha! Ovular merging!!! I guess women had more foresight than we thought! Thanks to ovular merging, they won't have to worry about foreskin! Here's a quote from Camille Paglia... \"If civilization had been left in female hands, we would still be living in grass huts\". I'm trying to imagine the world post ovular merging w<b> here not</b>hing but happy, non oppressed wimmins are ovular merging! I'm sure without men, and without electricity, ovular merging will be the least important scientific priority!\n\nThere's something to be said about killing your own prospects and then questioning why they aren't breathing, then bragging about the rise of women and the fall of men, then wondering why men don't take women seriously.\n\nSeriously, women are idiots. Tell them to shut up.",

                    "commentText": "Men Should Be Prostitutes And Charge Women For Conversation.\n\n\n                 MGTOW (men going their own way) is the primary cause of the ubiquitous articles about men being little boys and refusing to \"grow up\" or \"man up\". These <b> dumb </b>bitches are oblivious to the fact that they are turning into<b>  frog</b> soup. They are so involved in th<b> e woma</b>n world and stuck in their state of delusion and entitlement that they have no idea what is actually working from the inside out. But it's perfect synergy if you think about it!\n\nHi. I'm Professor Cos. Every day I hear a bunch of aging broads who missed the boat saying that they can't find a \"real man\" or get a man to \"commit\". Ladies, you can find them at any one of the following locations... Family court, divorce court, jail, homeless shelters, or on a yacht with some hot 23 year olds. These women still think they have options like a 21 ye<b> ar o</b<b> >ld ch</b>ick and are complaining about broke guys and guys who only want \"one thing\"... As if they can do much better than that! They have no idea that they're swimming with the other frogs in water that's slowly starting to boil. \"Women against feminism\" is an example of the frogs jumping for dear life to escape the covered pot of hot water. I can't wait to see how this is gonna play out!\n\nGuys, if you're wi<b> th a w</b>oman that thinks men should be \"gentlemen\"... D.T.B.. DUMP THAT BITCH. And the reason I don't take women on \"dates\" is because I generally just bang hoodrats and babymothers and nymphomaniacs and skanks. In fact, every bitch I bang thinks I'm funny and cool and smart and likes how witty I am.\n\nHere's my attitude... My company is more valuable t<b> han a </b>woman's company because I jus<b> t ne</b>ed sex from her and she enjoys a lot more th<b> an j</b>ust sex from me. Plus she actuall<b> y en</b>joys sex from me more tha<b> n I </b>enjoy sex from her! I don't find her funny or cool or interesting or \"amazing\" the way chicks find interesting guys. An i<b> nteres</b>ting woman to<b>  a man</b> is a woman that comes equipped with a remote control that has a transform button, a mute button, a food and beverage button, a multiply button, a multitask button, and a timeout button. A transform button for when he wants to turn her in<b> to a y</b>ounger woman <b> when</b> she gets old, or into a new bitch when he's tired of ba<b> ngin</b>g the same old broad, or into a big screen when he wants to watch the game... A mute button for when he wants her to shut the fuck up... A food and beverage button that automatically puts her to work in the kitchen... A multiply button that can turn her into multiple bitches... A multitask button for when he wants her to iron his shirts, make his breakfast and give him his morning blow job all at once, and a timeout button for when he wants the bitch out of the house.\n\nYou got all these \"cool girls\" trying to talk to us and become \"one of the guys\" and get involved in all the cool shit guys are doing. And most guys are just doing women favours by listening to their boring stories and pretending to be good listeners<b> . So g</b>uys, if a woman wants to spend time with you that<b>  doe</b>sn't involve sex, she has to pay! Bottom line. I'm a guy! I have all the swagger and charisma that she enjoys. And I'm obviously smarter than most women. Plus I don<b> 't eve</b>r look at a woman and go, \"man\"! \"I like her style\"! I wish I was just like her! Gu<b> ys don</b>'t look at a woman and go \"I want to be like her one d<b> ay\". G</b>uys look at a woman and go \"I want to bang her one day\". Plus as a man, my value and importance g<b> oes up</b> in society. A woman's value goes down.\n\nDid I forget to mention the abortion button?\n\nUnfortunately, the remote control doesn't come with an abortion button, but should you get your bitch pregnant, there is an inflate button that will blow her up till she explodes and splatters all over the place! So be sure to cover the walls with plastic. Even though you managed to prevent the bitch from having your baby, the downside is you're gonna have to order a new bitch because the remote control will not be able to transform your exploded bitch into multiple bitches to clean up the mess. I'm sure the Japanese can invent this device! Remember... Japanese men are also going their own way!",

Only recently (the last year or two) have women been allowed to be the ones getting shot, losing a body part (arm or leg), and risking life. The more they try to be like men, the worse it is for the <b> gender </b>differences that made them special. Now, there is almost<b>  nothing</b> special about them, and they have lost that special allure that men have always loved about them. This explains why younger men proposing marriage is down sharply from just 10 years ago and before. There are so many drawbacks for this insane drive to try to be \"equal\" to men, when actually they were superior in so many ways. But now (since the 1970s) that has to take a back seat for the extreme, radical feminists who can't stand to be treated like women. The hell with the feminists with their ugly tattoos, nose, mouth, eye (and other places) rings that make them look like primitive foreigners, instead of the exciting American women, they used to be. Now, they are (almost literally), \"one of the boys.\" I hope they enjoy being dragged down to become and treated like \"men\" they have craved to be all their rotten lives.",

Everything is harder for men in this world, because men are the disposable <b> sex.</b>  We don't get sympathy and help like women do.  Charities everywhere for struggling women, not so much for men.  That's why we commit suicide 5x as often, and no one gives a shit. We do more time for the same crimes, and we pay the majority of the taxes while women collect the majority of the tax-funded entitlements.  It's funny how through socialism, women have gotten us to support them through the state instead of marriage, and now they don't have to give us any<b>  pussy</b> in return. Rip off.  No wonder men are dropping out of society in droves, choosing to be homeless of just poor, living off welfare, food banks, dumpster diving.  Why not?  If women won't give us families to bust ass for, why not just go to the bottom and live of the detritus?  The only reason to voluntarily choose corporate enslavement is to support our wife and children who we love enough to sacrifice our freedom for.  If that's no longer on the table, fuck it, I'm gonna lay around in my undies and play video games, jerk off to porn, and live off taxes paid by feminist bitches instead.  No surprise that the latest feminist complaint about men is that so many of us have basically gone on strike and stopped working, paying those taxes to fund their lazy, greedy asses.",

She said being dragged down a flight of stairs having her head bang against each one of them does not sound too fun. So... kind of<b>  weird</b>, I work, she stays home with our four children, she cooks, cleans, shops... I mow the lawn or have one of my teen sons do so, I change the oil in our cars, I drink beer, go to the gym, fart (laugh), swear and basically AM a man... she does none of those things and loves me anyway. Married 23 years, happy... I don't know? I guess we are reall<b> y weir</b>d by today's standards. Because she does not live for Facebook, cross-fit, bang the mail man because she feels \"empowered\" by doing that kind of shit. (At least not that I'm aware of anyway...)    ; )",

It certainly shows when men treat women more like things than people. How would your mother or sisters feel?\n\n2: While men were able to go out and get any job they wanted women have had to fight just to have the same rights. Heck animals had better rights than<b>  a wom</b>an. It was okay to beat your wife but if you had beaten your mule, oh god forbid it!!! Even up until the 70's women couldn't even defend themselves from the wraths of drunken husbands.\n\n3: Insane Asylums: For better or worse women were almost always put in insane Asylums. From being able to read a novel to not being able to sexually satisfy her husband. And the man who put her into an asylum had to be the one to get her out. So a womans husband sticks into an Asylum because he wants to move onto a prettier younger thing, well he dies and her brother wants to get her out. Hes not allowed.\n\nWomen have been more oppressed over the years then men have. We are viewed<b>  as </b>sex objects rather than people. We are raised from birth to momma the man we married. We are supposed to have kids and stay home an<b> d do not</b>hing other then have dinner ready for our husbands run his bath water then go lay on the bed and prepare to not even being able to orgasm.",

The war of the sexes is over.  I will not make a claim as to who was the winner because there can be no winner in such a sick and twisted war.  However, our daughters were the big time losers.  Sadly they never even signed on to participate in such a destructive war.  It was imposed on them by liberal despots and their army of useful idiots.",

How about you take a much closer look at our history, where slavery came from and what conditions are like today. It was the Dutch traders and the English government who brought slavery to America. It was the <b> black </b>Africans who sold those slaves,<b>  black</b> slavery in Africa was practiced for hundreds of years. American colonists had no way of knowing what a few slaves coming here could cause one of the biggest and complex problems we would face.\n\nIt's easy to stand safely on the sidelines and judge our history. Many white Americans like myself were the ones who were there fighting this disgraceful injustice. It took 2 Presidents to end slavery and both were assassinated. There are very few, if any other country that could have accomplish that. If slavery bothers you so much, how about do something about slavery today?\n\nThomas",

                    "commentText": "+td fisk Back then America was so hell bent on turning people into robots and brain washing them to believe anything and everything was all peachy keen and back then people's mindset were not as those of today where people questioned things - harshly, critically and sensitively. And though I was born in the 1960's {even that time wasn't all that great except if you were a kid not really focused on reality} - how could America possibly been all that great a place to live with those types of ignorant and stupid rules going on. And like you said those videos were simply modern propaganda films made by simple minded men who knew exactly what they were doing which is why they made them in the first place. Which shows how hypocritical America was especially back then because I remember seeing documentaries about how the Japanese use their own propaganda against American prisoners and all of America got their panties in a bind go figure. So America can used propaganda against their own but if someone non-American does the same thing it's considered a harsh crime.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is why America's the laughing stock when it comes to the politics of telling other countries how they should live, think and treat their own people but America can't for whatever reason seem to clean up its own backyard. I'm not personally attacking you so please don't you dare come at me with an aggressive behavior I'm just stating some facts about our so-called good <b> old </b>America. But we're both on the same page on certain things but when you mentioned as quoted by you: \"Back then America was a great place to live, about 10,000% better than today. Have they cuffed and arrested any 5 year olds for<b>  sexual</b> assault this week? Those who think conditions are better now just don't know any better and have no interest to learn.\"\u00a0\n\n\nI do have to seriously disagree with you on your comment as you referenced quote: \"America was about 10,000% better than today.\" Let's be real that statement stands true for white people not all the other races struggling to live the American dream especially back then. I've got some horrific nightmare stories to tell you just from m<b> y blac</b>k family members trying to survive during that time. I'm not saying life was easy street for whites either because you had the wealthy white and poor white. And it's still the same today everyone's suffering from a white male control.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd just because Obama's president doesn't mean anything either let's be realistic on that also. Many white Americans did not want this American country to have anything to do with<b>  a bla</b>ck president. And since his first day in office up to today white america's still hounding him <b> but bl</b>ack Americans have crucified him as well. Many seem to think he's negle<b> cted b</b>lack people period but every time he's tried to pass a bill which would help everyone in general those white republicans, tea party egg heads and <b> other r</b>acist idiots continue to halt his progress. People will probably consider him the worst President of all time which is untrue. If people did their homework they'd see Obama's done quite well for himself as leader of this country. What's your views on my entire comment in general. Sorry for the long comment but I just had a lot to say.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm currently writing a screenplay about the feminist movement and hope to one day enter it into a screenwriting contest and hope to win and get it produced for the screen to show to all the world.",

That's not exactly what \"robots\" do. For claiming to question things you sure aren't any kind of example. I've heard what you're saying all over the internet and they are almost all exactly the same. It's called disinformation, but call it by it's real name, lies. So you think America has become so progressive? I guess we shouldn't mention all those school shootings that never happened in the 50s and 60s. No driveby shoots, no hard drugs (even marijuana was rare), virtually no teen pregnancies and the list goes on and on. Back then divorce was very rare and today only 25% of American children live with both natural parents. Everyone can see these facts every day. \n\n\nI'll show you just how mindless we were. In 1966 about 50 of my ship's crew went AWOL protesting conditions on the ship. I took it one step further. I went from Naples, Italy to Geneva, Switzerland, hiking 1/3 of the way through the Alps, to tell the American Ambassador about our grievances. In 1968 I threatened to kill an officer if he ordered us to fire on American protesters in Miami. He filed court Martial charges that could have sent me to prison for 20 years. See, the thing was, all those mindless robots backed me up, including my ship's captain.In Vietnam I know of several mutinies and in at least one case the Marines killed their company commander. In 1970 two US Coast Guard Cutters mutinied. What do we see today, the exact same thing you describe the 50s and 60s. Political correctness is the real pig fucker screwing us America today.\u00a0\n\n\nAs to your propaganda screenplay, the film industry have enough on the shelf to last 100 years.

There have always been the conditions you mentioned but they haven't been the majority as we see today. It is so <b> common </b>to see people get married, have some children and then get divorced while the children are still very young. It comes from the mass influence of being selfish. Having children should be regarded as a sacred responsibility and, yes, the parents should stay together and learn how to make the best of it for their children. I stayed in my marriage for over 20 years without intimacy <b> (sex</b>) for 20 years. That's because my sons were a sacred responsibility. Children should never have to pay for their parents mistakes. \n\n\nYou should know the difference between selfishness and natural disasters like losing both parents. Foster homes is the worst form of child abuse inflicted on children by social workers. One of our biggest problems today is all the selfishness. I was there when that was first introduced. One stupid psychologist even wrote a book encouraging it, \"Looking Out For Number1\".After that it was loving yourself and it got worse from there. There's a<b> n ol</b>d saying, you made your bed now sleep in it. The feminists were the worst by encouraging women to think of you, what do you want. Their hatred of men also included the hatred of family and disregarding their children. Excuses for selfishness is inexcusable. Self sacrifice is one of the greatest virtues of our species. I put my life at risk many times to save life, and I saved over 100. \n\n\nInstead of just arguing, take some time to look around you, look at people and listen to them. You'll be surprised at what you learn.\n\n\nThomas",

But yeah some people are quite selfish when it comes to love - some people only want to be on the receiving end and get, get, and more get. But ask them why aren't you or why don't you give and they into a whole tirade about this and that and matters get worst and before you know it this is saying something bad\u00a0about this one and that one's throwing it back - and it's war.\nFamily is the one important thing everyone still has -\u00a0no matter what the circumstance. I know some people's parents are no longer alive but they've still got others to lean on for some type of support. But you take the bad with the good the bitter with the sweet. Lifestyles of any family is always unpredictable. But one must not allow too much negativity to dampen things. Because at the end of everyday - you can choose your friends and acquaintances but you have no control over who your family is. I hope I answered your question Salma.",

If people can understand just how important the family and marriage is, they have a much better chance of not getting divorced. More important is people will find that there marriage is worth the effort and emotional endurance. When I was a kid, I saw <b> elderly </b>couples who were as much in love after 50 years of marriage as they were in the beginning. They learned exactly what unconditional love is and that takes a long time. The sweetest thing i saw was these people,<b>  old</b> and wrinkled still saw each other as beautiful.\n\n\nLove is not a concept and your friends didn't share the real pain and suffering they experienced from the divorce. Real love is the exact opposite of selfish. The term \"love\" is used so frivolously these days. It's not at all true that everyone in the world is selfish with love. I just explained to you how unselfish I was and made sacrifices because of my love for my sons. Though I've been very unlucky with romantic love, I know just how powerful real love is and how strong it makes you. Circumstances in life can be very cruel when it comes to love, so many people have been horribly hurt by people who didn't love them but pretended to love. Real love makes you incapable of hurting those you love. It is very important to be able to see and feel love and tell the difference from claimed love that isn't real.\n\n\nThomas",

Everything you say is so preposterous that only the dumbest people would believe you. Those things happened, they've always happened in every single country, but it was the smallest fraction of what you claim. If wives and children were so brutally treated as you claim there would be tons of proof. That's because Americans were nearly obsessive about taking pictures and movies. \n\n\nIf you actually knew anything, you would know that Social Services (Child Protection) was very aggressive about intervention. There wasn't the outright <b> witch </b>hunt that began in the late 70s, but severe physical abuse was very raely ignored. I never saw it and maybe a couple of times heard of it. You make it sound like Americans loved to beat their children to a bloody pulp and it was everywhere.\n\n\nAs to wife beatings, yes that did happen, but no more than it happens today. Back then the extended family was very strong. The police did rarely intervene because it was a family matter. Men who beat their wives was handled by the father and her brothers. Men like that would have preferred the police. In my late teens my youngest sister was beaten and he even put a gun to my nephew's head. When I got there he was sitting on the porch, I knew he had the gun. I walked up to him only a few inches away and told him make any move and you die. He knew I had been in hand-to-hand combat so he froze. The police came and said there was no evidence. I told them, that's fine you can leave now. I was getting irritated with the police and told my brother-in-law if he even threatens them I'll kill him. There's more to it, but families were respected back then to deal their with their own problems and we did. Today activists wants the government to do everything. We all know the good a job they do.\n\n\nThe nastiest thing about the internet is the magnitude of people who lie like you do. You most certainly did not live in America in the 50s and 60s and it's just too easy to see you're lying.\n\n\nThomas",

All of these brutal attacks on the American way of life has reached a point where anyone who can think for themselves and question can see what's going on. This has been an internal war unlike any other in our history. Leftists are remarkably smart, but they have become overconfident and when American Patriots \u00a0fight back, it will be over before the leftist idiots knew what hit them.\u00a0\n\nIf you notice on the internet, most of the politically correct zombies are not American. There are so few young Americans that they've had to flood the place with imposters, mostly Chinese and Russians. The funny thing is, they're so bad at it. Recently one of them even tried to argue with me about where Arlington National Cemetery is, he said it was in Washington. What a bunch of clowns.\n\nThomas",

There were extremely strong beliefs of feminine superiority in all sorts of areas, including highly moralised areas in which women were judged superior to men, beliefs which still haven't fully died out. I know I'm not the only guy who grew up in the last 20 years with their mother routinely proclaiming the superiority of a mother's love.\nThere were also huge demands around masculinity, especially physically standing up for yourself and not being a coward, aswell as an expectation that you would put the safety, comfort and even the lives of the women close to you above your own. It wasn't a conspiracy to oppress women, it was based on a much harsher world we were just coming out of - and the fact that a lot of women LIKED and had an entitled attitude towards the idea of having a man do all the stuff they didn't want to do. Most women ime STILL don't want to do this stuff, there's just an awful lot less of it nowadays.",

In fact, just counting prison rapes of male victims compared with ALL female victims, men are still more often the victims of rape (and we're not talking \"regret\" or \"date rape\" or any of that, we're talking about brutal, violent forced rape).\n\nMales have no legal protection from genital mutilation but females do. Infant males routinely have their genitals mutilated while infant girls almost never do and it's always considered a crime legally and shameful socially.\n\nSome girls in some parts of the world can be \"forced\" into marriage but nearly all men in all parts of the world are forced into working to protect/provide for women! Of the two, which is the greater injustice? Being forced to marry or being forced to hand over your paycheck for the rest of your fucking life?? You can't talk about ONLY the female role while ignoring the legal standards men are ALSO held to!\n\nThe \"<b> gender </b>wage gap\" is a myth! Men work more, work longer hours, work more weekends, take more dangerous jobs, work more overtime. Men make up over 90% of all on-the-job injury and death. Men work harder and die sooner so women can live better (80% of ALL consumer spending is spent on women!)\n\nWomen cannot be harassed without men being punished.

                    "commentText": "+Shori Sims \n\nYou have made several errors in logic. The video was made in\nAmerica and Americans were the target audience. This en masse approach of feminist apologetics is used as a ploy to shame American men. The rights which need to be discussed are women's rights in the U.S. We are not responsible for every wrong committed against women worldwide. I dare say the American feminist only pays lip service to their supposed cosmopolitan sisters. The equating of crimes to women's rights are ludicrous, such as rape, abuse, and being attacked by acid all carry severe penalties, in this aspect you are using a non sequitur. As far as the straw man argument of being \"taken advantage of\" and \"generally harassed and mistreated\" how could this be quantified in any logical method; it is just feminist hyperbole salted with petulance, and the reverse could also be true in these type of instances. \nFeminists have not one problem taking away men's rights for\ntheir own id\u00e9e fixe of choice. When a <b> woman </b>decides to murder the baby inside her which was conceived by both man and<b>  woman</b>; the feminist viewpoint is that the father's opinion matters not. If th<b> e woma</b>n decides to have the baby then it is required by law that the man supports this child for eighteen years; this is blatant hypocrisy. Why do these women elevate themselves above men? Is it for some idiotic notion of \"choice\" they are allowed to do murder of the innocent? This is not noble or a right, but it is a crime no matter what the courts say. The blood of the unborn is on their hands.\nAccording to many feminists if<b>  a wom</b>an uses violence against a man; the man should only restrain <b> the wo</b>man and never respond in kind. Most men are taught through parenting, and mass media, that it is correct to protect\nwomen; it is also innate in most men. Women know this and some take full\nadvantage of this honorable character trait. When women use violence to attack a man they have taken it upon themselves to play on the same field as a man. Many times the man is arrested after having been assaulted and after responding in kind. \nI  managed in a large retail establishment and worked\nwith women of all ages. In my anecdotal experience and for the most part; equal pay for equal work does not exist. It is a nice slogan; in reality; it is less\nwork for the same pay. I have been told by women at work \" that is man's\nwork I am not doing that\" \"that is too much work\" and I have to assign a male to the task. My superiors are rightly afraid of law suits and will or cannot respond properly. \nFeminists tend to believe that it is great to be a man and want all of the advantages of a being man. The truth is that the feminist cherry picks the few advantages of being a man and ignores the difficulties. It is very arduous to be a good man and the feminist has no idea what it is like to have this duty.\u00a0\nWhat I find \u00a0stupid is that the feminists are in favor of \u00a0women being allowed in combat situations, as if this disallowance is somehow <b> anti-w</b>oman. Do they really think that men want to be shot, stabbed, maimed, crippled, sleep out in all types of weather and get killed or captured? The next mission I lead, I would be more than happy to let you front the operation.\nI had not watched television in five years and was at friends who was watching a sitcom. In this sitcom the men were\u00a0 portrayed as weak, stupid, and subservient t<b> o the </b>woman. The feminist has no problem with this depiction as it reinforces her worldview that women are superior to men in most circumstances. You see not one complaint in favor of men by any feminist.\nMany of the younger teen and young adult women dress like whores\non the street and men are vi<b> sually </b>sexual by nature.<b>  If th</b>e woman sees a man looking at her that she deems undesirable he is labeled a pervert. They dress like honey to attract bees and when they attract flies they are incensed. If you have an opportunity, do a search for \"slut walk\" on Youtube. Many <b> of the</b>se woman endorse dressing as sluts and exhibit like behavior and claim that America is a rape culture. They are fear mongering for nefarious reasons. Women's rights along with feminism is based upon lies, half-truths, and is taught to young children. There will be literal hell to pay for this.\n\nThis gist of this Shori Simms is that your feminist worldview is buffoonery which aids in the destruction of the family. Women indeed have many more rights than men and will take jobs that women will not do for some obtuse arrogant rational. If you have any questions of me use manners such as \"please.\" After all, if a man was as rude to you as you were to me; you would be picketing their workplace and or home while demanding fair treatment while clamoring that laws be passed because you were dishonored as the  most perfect being ever created. You need to reexamine your worldview and logic, because sweetheart you have been lied to and have all the breaks you need. A comedienne whose name escapes me stated this truth, \"Chivalry is dead and women (Shori Sims) killed it.\"",

Also, if women were smarter than men they wouldn't need all those laws to get equal pay and career opportunities. Unless of course one believes that <b> patriarchy,</b> oppression and bigotry are so strong that women can't make it even though they're smarter than men.\n\nWhat's the motivation of the men writing these sitcoms (assuming it's mostly men, I haven't checked that)? I don't know. Probably it's many things. I guess one point is what's accepted in today's society. You can make fun of a white heterosexual guy and that's fine. If you make too much fun of somebody else, it's considered<b>  sexism</b><b> , racis</b>m or whatever. Then I guess another point is the same as with commercials. They want to make a product that sells well, so they will produce something that the audience likes. I would guess that the majority of the audience is female, especially during the day.",

And even if women made less on average, we have to ask ourselves why, if it really is discrimination. There are some good arguments that there are many other reasons other than discrimination. Like women not asking for a raise as often as men and not negotiating their wage. And to be honest, I believe that in a free society you should even be free to discriminate. That might make you an a-hole, but in a free society I think one should be free to be an a-hole :-)",

You feminists with your <b> patriarchy </b>rhetoric seem to be looking at the past through a modern filter, where women can choose when and if to have children and how many.  \n\nBack when the typical<b>  woman</b> had a house full of critters to cook for raise, change, discipline, etc with two always hanging off their breasts and one on the way, they didn't exactly have the option of going to college and competing in the career world. And those evil men you feminazis talk about? Well they could have knocked them up and then walked away, but they didn't, they stepped up and married them, worked their asses off in dangerous jobs to provide them and their babies with food, shelter, clothing and all the necessities of life. And when they were threatened, stepped up and fought LIKE MEN to protect them, even dying by the millions in wars to keep their women and children safe at home.  \n\nMen of the past did right by their women, and even died for them, and they deserve better than your vile, sexist hatred.\n\nMen invented everything that gave modern women the freedom and advantages they enjoy today, eve<b> n feminaz</b>i morons like yourself, and everything else that modern civilization would be impossible without. Stop and think what your life would be like without everything men, mainly straight white men, invented for you.  Men NEVER oppressed women and feminism did not liberate them, men did, by inventing pills and devices that defeated your real oppressor, MOTHER NATURE.\n\nAnd if you want to know the real reason you women are so miserable today, consider the stereotype of the bitt<b> er o</b>ld maid, and the fact that now that women have a choice whether or not to bear children, which many are opting out of.  Evidence, and personal experience proves that the happiest women are the ones who choose traditional roles - wife, mother, homemaker. Those women are loved by their husbands, their children, their grandchildren, love and respect that they earned the way their mothers and grandmothers and women through history always have, and that makes them the happiest women on earth.

All you have to do is act like a man, and you can have everything your little heart desires.\" BULLCRAP! They can now be the aforementioned type of low-brow men (druggies, alcoholics, fired and getting depressed), just like men have. Because you have now BECOME a man, if not in body (which many<b>  transgender</b> females now seem to want to be), and go off to war to kill and be killed, or viciously wounded, both in body and in mind (PTSD feelings, wanting to hurt others, and/or commit suicide). Big deal! You want to be like a man, you got it, all the negatives, while none of the positives! \n\nAnd women have steadily become less attractive as marriage material to the Millennial men, who secretly despise these radical nutsos as wanting \"equality\" when they are actually lowering themselves trying to be something they can never be. As women (pre-1970), they were treated like queens, and men loved and adored them as women. \n\nNow, they are frequentl<b> y nothin</b>g but crass, low-brow, hating men, cussing like a man, dressing as a man (ex, Hillary always in drab Mao-looking, man-impersonating pantsuits, as a striking piece of her man-hating ideology in attracting other man-hating women), while turning off millions of men--costing her the election,. \n\nThey (women) got exactly what they deserved in their never-ending quest for \"equality\"--disgust and avoidance from real men who want a re<b> al wom</b>an, not a pseudo-man, for love and intimacy. Now, men get only hate and spite, virulent cussing (worse than truckers), and spitting (or hitting) them, and avoidance of dating and serious desire to marry these man-hating creeps.",

The reason women make less on average isn't because society has it in for women, but because (a) they tend to take less dangerous and less skilled jobs which pay less and (b) they get pregnant and take time off from work. One of the \"war on women\" sources actually compared a man and women in the same field, but in different jobs. For instance, a secretary and a geologist may both work for the same oil company, but she's going to make less than he does and it would be unreasonable to pay a secretary the same as a geologist.",

Don't just swallow everything they tell you. Make sure you check it out for yourself. Teachers aren't any different than anybody else. They can be wrong and they can have their own agendas. In this case, they're trying to sell you a political ideology, not historical accuracy. It's true that women, on the whole, don't make as much as men. But it isn't part of a conspiracy. Like I said earlier, it's because men tend to take more dangerous and more skilled jobs that pay more, and women tend to take more time off to raise children. And because, like I said, often, when these figures are compiled, the man and <b> woman </b>being compared aren't in the same job or have the same experience.So, again, a geologist and a secretary aren't going to make the same, even if they work in the same field. Just as a<b>  woman</b> who takes six months off after her baby is born to care for her baby isn't going to make as much as a man who works all twelve months. Don't fall for the propaganda.",

This has<b>  nothing</b> to do with your argument come on stop defending ignorance. Your example though you may have had good intentions still was way off base. Where have you been living for the past many years - I'<b> m blac</b>k and there have been plenty times whe<b> re bla</b>ck people have s<b> aid rac</b>ist things and they absolutely made the news example. When Rev Jessie Jackson was running for president he made mention of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY as b<b> eing H</b>ymie town. And boy did he get much flack from that so much it forced him to come out and apologize on camera.\u00a0\n\n\nThe same when Rev Al Sharpton made many verbal assaults against whites and he too got crucified by the news media. And then back during the 90's there was this one incident wh<b> ere a </b>black man attacked a<b>  white</b> woman, he spit in her face and brutally attacked her punching and kicking her with his feet and fists. Then just a few years back there was an incident <b> where </b>a black guy sitting in a park during a summer day yelled out that the next white person he saw he would attack and beat the hell out of him and he did and that too made the news. So don't you dare tell<b>  me as</b> a black man that if white people say somethin<b> g they'</b>re racist while blacks go unpunished.\u00a0\n\n\nYou obviously haven't done your homework I suggest you do so. The point I'm making here is not to destroy you or personally hatefully attack but to educate you and other white people who seem to foolishly think that all whites are this innocent persona while all blacks are evil. There's a percentage of ignorance on every side <b> from </b>every race. <b> Again </b>I'm a black man just trying to set the record straight.",

Your comment on \"<b> Hymie </b>Town\" instantly took me back to Eddie Murphy's \"Best Of\" moments when he sang as Rev Jessie Jackson with the song <b> \"Hymie</b> Town\"! OMG!! lol!  Thanks for the laugh!\n\nSadly, back to reality, Blacks are 98% of the tim<b> e racis</b>t about Whites to this very day, more now with Obama at the helm, and thanks to their \"knock out\" games and rioting in the streets, they have become the worst thugs in our society. Taking up 80%+ of the prisons while only making up 8% of the population in the United States, I think they have done a fantastic job at showing their extreme hatred of the country that they live in. Despite Whites giving them equal rights, the Blacks still call things \"uneven\", refuse to get jobs and laugh about getting money for \"free\" on welfare, all the while getting as many white women pregnant and then abandoning them afterwards, thus ruining society as a whole, and killing off the quality of life we could have in this country!\n\nNow, had Blacks just gone out and got a job instead of living on welfare 95% of the time, sticking with their own kind and actually staying with them after they impregnate the female,  having good family values, and instead of creating music that talks about killing cops and getting \"bitches\" pregnant and leaving them to deal with life on their own while laughing about it, they probably would not be disliked by the vast majority of people throughout the enti<b> re nati</b>on. I think that you know this is true, however, you probably wont want to tell the truth about <b> it. Rac</b>ism is more widely bred into<b>  the B</b>lack communities, and hate is spread through them like wildfire. \n\nBy the t<b> ime a </b>Black child <b> is t</b>he age of 5 or 6, many of them are already cursing, talking about killing the cops, and hating on whites. I know this well as my family have a lot of teachers in them that teach the youth, and 95% of the classroom problems a<b> re fro</b>m Black children that are acting like their parents. It's just horrible how Blacks have helped to destroy America, and American culture in general, and are allowed to continue to do so because, god forebid, if White people intervene it is a<b> n act o</b>f Racism! So, we are just supposed to sit back and watch Blacks burn down entire towns and citys, and protest and riot, well, because if we do anything about it, we are just being damn Racists!",

It's certainly not \"oh because cops i<b> s racis</b>t\", because we all know it's certainly not true.\u00a0\n\nI have also been a substitute teacher for second grade classes, (most people in my family are teachers), and the largest amount of disruption a<b> re bla</b>ck kids. This is just a simple fact, no matter HOW you want to put it, facts are facts, and blacks in America are the largest percentage of criminals that we have. That's just how it is. For every 1 white person committing an act of murder, there are 100 Blacks committing murder. For every 1 mexican committing grand theft auto, there are 25 blacks committing grand theft auto.\n\nI also have a few police officers in my family, and I have visited the prison out here where I live, and about 80% is filled with Blacks, 15% mexicans, 4% whites and 1% Asians, and this is basically how it is nationwide. I think it's a damn shame that Blacks cannot stop themselves from being rude, hateful, mean and evil in America, and just be like the ones in Australia, and Europe. If Blacks in America could just get their act together in America, <b> the nat</b>ion would be a better place to live.\n\nThese are just simple facts, how many whites do you see, EVER, cau<b> sing </b>race riots in the streets, burning down innocent peoples businesses, whenever some white guy gets shot by the Police? How many? Until you can answer this question realistically, and take the blame for your own people, please take your nonsense to someone that cares, because I tell it like it is, and I don't sugar coat anything.\n\nSadly, 98% of Blacks are a CANCER in America at this point in time, and until you guys change for the better, you will be your own worst enemy, and even if your \"one of the good ones\", the rest of your people are making you look bad. You guys have been FREE from oppression for how many damn years now?\n\nYou guys need to grow up, suck it up, go to school, shut your mouths, learn something, become something, make good music that is peaceful and inspiring, teach your kids to be stand up citizens, stick with your family's and become good fathers for your children, and become a part of a good society. This is what you guys need to do in order to succeed and you will finally be looked at as decent people in America.\n\nHowever, I think you have a LONG way to go in order to do that, and I personally don't think you guys have it in you to do so. 200 years from now you guys will probably still be the same, spouting the same nonsense, rioting in the streets and demanding reparations for your ancestors being slaves and demanding free money etc etc.. Some things never change, sadly. Good luck!",

The Feminist Movement has been from its inception, and continues to be about establishing females at the upper ranks of government, business, and society, whether they are qualified or not, as compensation for years of being held down by males because of their role in reproduction and child rearing. Society used to look askance at a <b> woman </b>who delivered a child and then turned its rearing over to others. Now society has the same scorn for a<b>  woman</b> who choses to stay home with her children. This paradigm was invented by women and is maintained by women, regardless of thei<b> r gende</b>r. Betty Friedan stated it most starkly in her book The Female Eunuch. I paraphrase, If<b>  a wom</b>an has a child and then chooses to stay home and care for it, it would be better that she take a gun, put it in her mouth, and pull the trigger, so as to not use up resources that could be used by more useful people. It seems that even in the ranks of the core feminist group there is inequality for those who do not follow the party line. This disgruntlement with being female goes all the way back to Adam and Eve. The serpent enticed Eve to rebel against both God and Adam by telling her that if she ate the forbid<b> den fr</b>uit she would no longer be Adam's helpmeet but she would be like God, she would be ruling over A<b> dam! Not</b>hing has changed. As for equality for everyone, check out a ranking schedule for measuring corporate diversity. Ours has white males as zeros, nonwhite males as ones, white females are ones, nonwhite females are twos. To these bases points are added the individual's score for membership in other protected classes! Protected classes, now their is the stake through the heart of any idealistic notion of equality being the Utopian goal of our nobel leaders.",

                    "commentText": "@Allan Bosley obviously there are more negative connotations to the \"that's women for ya\" statement in that case because he is saying its typical that women are incompetent, whereas her \"that's men for ya\" comment was on him expecting a high standard. The depictions of men that are generalist and sexist in the modern day typically are used as a means to excuse their bad behaviour. Men are cavemen so they will naturally rape and cheat, its a <b> woman'</b>s fault for being too sexy if she gets raped, or not sexy enough if he cheats- that sort of thing. I agree that these stereotypes are wrong and harmful to men, but they tend to be MORE sexist and harmful for women because they are the ones who get blamed and victimized as a result. Another example is the idea that bachelors are terrible at housework, and cleaning products are marketed at women as a result. It is expected of mothers and wives (even working wives) to bear the burden of housework because men are incompetent and need looking after. The truth is that in a relationship couples should share housework equally, and when single men typically can look after themselves. But when people see a<b>  woman</b> with a messy hows they say \"you'll never get a husband\" but when a man has a messy house they say \"you need a wife\".",

In cases of domestic violence, where the victim is a male battered by a female, and police are called, often the male is mocked by statements like, 'what's the matter can't you control the little <b> woman.</b>' This cavalier rejoinder is, not only inappropriate, but flies in the face of the law. Had this battered male responded to his batterer in anyway that left a mark, even just restraining her in order to stop the blows, he would already be cuffed and in the squad car heading to a court date where HE is charged with domestic violence! In most states the male, even if he was the victim, is the party that is arrested, because the law does not want to take mommy away from the kiddies! Is this not sexist on its face? It is like a store that sells flatscreen televisions. If someone breaks in and steals a TV should the police arrest the store owner for having TVs that would tempt someone to break into his store and steal it? I will concede your 'freedom to explore<b>  gender</b> roles' when males can bear children and females are able to impregnate them! In the workplace this marvelous egalitarian experiment has it a brick wall. Many of the jobs males have traditionally held require 'man'ual labor, not because the job was traditionally filled by a male but because it required a male's physical strength. One example I can recall required a male to be able to take a sixteen pound sledgehammer by the end of the handle with one hand, raise it straight up, lower the head to his forehead, and reraise it. There are a lot males incapable of doing that! But if a female must be hired, because o<b> f gende</b>r equality, even though she could not pass the test, should the employer be required to also hire males who could not pass the test? And what happens when these unqualified people become injured because of their deficiency? This nonsensical concept of the 'equality' of the genders, and the liability ramifications of complying with it is why hundreds of thousands of manual labor jobs have been exported to countries that still, foolishly, believe that there is a difference between males and females. The steel making industry is one that comes to mind.",

That we AGREE on, I agree we have unfortunately a long way to go before we can achieve that. What I was saying abou<b> t gende</b>r roles is that women can have strong upper bodies, there are a huge amount of strong female body builders and women with good upper body strength. Men naturally have a stronger upper body than women, but women naturally have a stronger lower body than men (better for running and protecting children) yet the fastest person on earth right now is a man. The reason I'm saying this is if someone fits the roles and requirements of a field he or she wants to enter, they should be able to enter it. Baking and Cooking are seen as traditional female skills, yet some of the most well known bakers and cooks are male (like Cake Boss and Emiril.) If<b>  a wom</b>an is strong and capable and lifts weights, than they are better fit for a job at a steel mill than a man whose weak and has little to no upper body strength. Look at how anchors have been traditionally male professions, yet women like Diane Sawyer and Katie Couric have both been very successful in those fields. I'm not saying force a quota that's bad for the company or the profession, I'm saying people need to accept a person for their potential skill, and not assume someone is better than somebody else based on th<b> eir gen</b>der, because I'd rather have a st<b> rong w</b>oman working at my steel mill than a weak man.",

I don't watch Emiril's show, nor am I a fan of Cake Boss, but I recognize their success. Does that make sense? Sorry I'll try and work to make my points more clear. \u00a0Each person is very successful in their profession because they excelled at the profession, not because of their<b>  gender</b>. The reason women can run faster is not to chase children but to take children and run away from potential attackers and predators. Women were supposed to be better runners so they could quickly take their children away from danger (this is dating back to when we were early hominids.) The reason I pointed this out was so I could make another point, and that is that, despite the fact that women are naturally better runners, the fastest person in the world right now is a man, like I said in the previous comment. Even though female runners should be faster than him since they are stronger physically in their lower body, he is the best runner on Earth because he is the most capable runner. Genetics and societal roles do not always come into play with who succeeds and who doesn't. No one is going to tell the fastest person on Earth that he isn't the fastest just because <b> a woma</b>n should be able to run faster than him. The truth is, <b> no wom</b>an can, and that's why he's the fastest person on Earth. That's what I meant by the steel mill, if you get two workers to come in for an interview, and one is a very str<b> ong wo</b>man and the other is a very weak man, than the person you should pick is the stronger worker. Now if a man a<b> nd a w</b>oman come in and the man is strong an<b> d the </b>woman is strong, I agree the man should be picked, but you shouldn't pick a weak man over a <b> strong</b> woman just because the roles don't fit traditionally.",

I believe that the only reason women have left their homes and families is because a very shrill minority of women have succeeded in planting a lie in not only the minds of women, but also in their hearts. That lie is that if a <b> woman'</b>s aspiration in life is to be a wife, homemaker, and Mother, she should take a gun, place it in her mouth, and pull the trigger (Germaine Greer, The Female Eunuch) because she is using up resources that would be better used by more productive individuals. Do you know what a eunuch is? This is an extreme opinion, absurd on its face, but one that has been effective in shaping the image of American womanhood's image of itself for three generations. Every person has had a Mother. This<b>  woman</b> is responsible for teaching her children 85% of all they will learn throughout their lives. This task cannot  be accomplished as a part time job! The present paradigm of women assigning the responsibility of rearing their children to others has an outcome that has not been acknowledged. Perhaps because many women have a child as her initiation into the sisterhood of the womb, but that club is only about the fellowship of women, it is not about encouraging women to raise and nurture their own children. The out working of the absent mother state is that these women's children do not imprint on their mothers but on their caregivers! If you were to see, as I have, children rush away from their mothers to join the herd of abandoned children there gathered, who refuse to give their mother a hug or a kiss it would break your heart. To expect that there will ever be a return to closeness in these riven asunder relationships is foolishness. Is this why for the the last decade or so college students and independent young people have NO pictures of family members in their dwellings? The only pictures they have where they live are of  friends! My own husband had a working mother. Every Mother's Day in our church everyone is ask to say what they are thankful for about their m",

Sarcasm is when some one asks you an obvious question and you give them an obviously opposite answer and you do it in a sarcastic tone.

Plus my shoes get wet. I can't have that either, seeing as how my feet already emit a wicked stench due to my severe athlete's foot fungus. Did I mention I only have two toes on each foot?",

Why do these self-absorbed, nose in the air drama queens think that they should be the determiners of how every othe<b> r woma</b>n should want to live their lives? From what I have seen they don't even run their own lives very well! If this was all that was available to choose from for a wife I would prefer to sleep alone!",

                    "commentText": "@Jessica Maresca\u00a0And some women do want to be housewives and devote themselves to their family. Not every image of a housewife is automatically <b> sexism.</b> Not even the idealized image of a housewife is automatically sexist. Take for instance, the coffee commercial. Literally all that happens in that is she made bad coffee (which, as I've said earlier, no one back then made good coffee) and her husband (who is pretty ungrateful, but that's the worse stereotype in the commercial if the depictions of that commercial are supposed to represent each<b>  gender</b> as a whole entirely- I doubt very much that most men even back then would throw childish fits because they're too incompetent to fix their own coffee) throws it out because it's so bad.\nShe's not stupid, she just has the same trouble that anyone brewing coffee before home coffee machines became a thing. She was using a percolator, and wasn't using a good brand of coffee (according to the commercial, their brand is the good one) to make her coffee. Her demeanor is a little simpering, but consider that it's a commercial for coffee, of course she's going to be more worried about the quality of her coffee than her husband's tantrum. WWIII could be going on behind her, and she's be more worried about the quality of her coffee. That's commercials in general. Think of all the commercials now for detergents that show a kid, oh say, dumping grape juice on himself wallowing in the mud, or what ever else, and all the mom (dad sometimes too) does is say \"oh no, I have to get those stains out\" instead of \"GET OUT OF THAT MUD, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT GRAPE JUICE!!!???\" Or the ones for the floor cleaning services that show kids in metal cleats running across nice finished wood floors. Those kids do not get grounded for leading a stampede of their rowdy teammates (obviously unannounced since the parent is always shocked/has \"oh you kids!\" face when it happens) into their home, they just wonder how to clean the mess up.\nMy point being this: Just because <b> a woma</b>n is in the kitchen doesn't make something \"horrifying\" as you said it. Things can be interpreted as much worse if you lack information, and do not take a more broad approach to them. Some of these commercials are comple<b> te sexi</b>sm, some just are just missing the same cultural context that they depended on at the time they were made, and it's easier to misinterpret them today. Anyway,<b>  if </b>old t<b> imey se</b>xism horrifies you, you should lighten up. If you can't laugh at the silly way things were, you're going to be horrified by everything you see for the rest of your life. It's better to laugh than to get mad about it, because you can't change the past now.",

These hypersensitive females carry around on their shoulders a chip the size of Mount Rushmore hoping someone one will knock it off so they can get all indignant. While these commercials get their panties all in a wad, the failure to recognize how feminism has screwed them over is tragic! I  mentioned Betty Friedan's  The Female Eunuch. I asked iif they knew what a eunuch was, not a peep. Feminism has manipulated young women into striving to be males and then removing the genitalia they have worked so diligently to earn. Feminism demands, on punishment of excommunication, that to be a member in good standing they must never do anything that was heretofore considered feminine! They are eunuchs in the sense that they cannot impregnate anyone and restrained by intimidation from pursuing becoming pregnant by rule, unless something happens that results in pregnancy but only as long as she is unable to remember how it happened.",

Everyone has to make their own personal leap of faith at some point, even if they are raised to believe. Anyone who has a personal relationship with God knows what I'm talking about, that transformative moment where you release your will to a higher power and that power changes you into more than your are, a feeling of wholeness that no words can ever express.  Atheists dismiss these things as mass delusion, <b> mental </b>illness, wishful thinking etc.  But it happens to billions of people, of all faiths, as there are as many paths as there are seekers.\n\nGod can never be proven to anyone, only faith can take you through that door, and once you're there, the mocking and derision others heap on you just becomes meaningless static, and fills you with pity more than anything because they simply have no idea what they are denying themselves, the thing that finally makes sense out of this existence, makes it truly worth the suffering.  And I'm not talking about superstitious dogma about the afterlife or any of that crap.

The only thing that ever really stood in women's way to having that kind of life was their inability to control pregnancy.

Most women in the late 50s into the mid 60s wanted to find a good man with a good job to marry, to buy a house, and fill it with children. The husband took care of the outside of the house, car, yard, and helped with the children. The wife took care of the inside of the house, the laundry, the cooking, the babies, sick kids, the preparation of meals, and helped the children with the after meals cleanup! \nWhen the females began whining about equal rights my Mother and her sister, my aunt, laughed! They both were fond of saying, 'equal rights? I am not willing to get down off of my throne to be equal with any man!' \nJohn Wayne said that the women who were whining about equal rights destroyed the MATRIARCHY that had existed in America and upset the order of things to the point that everybody was confused about what was expected in relationships (my paraphrase). \nWomen reserve the right to get peavish over anything and everything but refuse to grant the same privilege to males!

The culture of 1950's & 60's women was the way it was because virtually all women had a lot of kids and they had no reason to think their lives would go any differently. Being saddled to motherhood was inevitable before accurate, cheap and available birth control.  Not all women wanted that life, some wanted independence from marriage and family, and painted a false picture of <b> patriarchy </b>and oppression, creating the feminist cult.  But virtually ALL urban/suburban women at least wanted LESS children, because children are a LOT of work, and less kids means less work. It only makes sense to have a huge family when you're living on a family farm, where the more kids you have the more you can produce. Besides, for 12,000 years having lots of children were your only retirement plan.  Women that got into the \"liberation\" movement did not realize what they were giving up.  You're absolutely right that they had it a lot better than men ever have, even with a house full of critters to care for.  Ever since women have abandoned the family life, trying to live like men, female unhappiness has steadily increased. Women need babies to be happy. Men need families to be happy.  Going our separate ways, both sexes are increasingly miserable.",

Before this mother got to the head of the line the checker began engaging her. The mother commented that she was homeschooling her children. The checker began talking about her own choice to work outside of the home and all that it was going to mean for her. The mother asked her what she was planning to do.

In a letter to Parliament she advocated for the abolition of the institution of marriage because it was slavery for women. She also argued for a government stipend for the support of women and the bastards they would be raising. Where the advocacy for these women to get a job and turn it into a career, then set aside funds, and when she has amassed the necessary funds become pregnant and bear the child, and support herself and her child from the savings. Alimony and child support are atavisms of <b> patriarchy </b>and must be held in disdain by any<b>  woman</b> desiring to throw off the shackles of slavery, the same goes for welfare. The monies collected as taxes are contributed by men, the receipt of such funds are de facto dependence on men for support. Is it not a contradiction that some liberated females are dependent upon $80,000.00 from men in order to support themselves and their children.",

Like today, most successful commercials took on a humorous nature because humour sold big time. Everyone had just come out of the war and anything to bring a laugh was welcome...so they took the piss out stereotypes..harmless fun.. today there are too many buuthurt overly offended people that can't see the intent, just the words.

Majority of people are that way. \nThe key is not to take advantage of anyone and treat everyone with respect. That's respect, not sensitivity. That's optional. The arguments people like you make are so deeply rooted in ignorance that it makes refuting a real chore. \nCase and point men and women are different and inherently unequal in role but deeply equal in importance and value. Two pieces to a puzzle molded that way after thousands of years of evolution.  Never let anyone tell you your femininity is weakness forced on you by a phantom <b> misogynist </b<b> >patriarchy</b> or that your masculinity is \"toxic\" and something to suppress. \nThat's how they break you down, giving into these identity politics. \nHumans left to their own devices will embrac<b> e gende</b>r roles. It's been proven time and time again. Hell, it even happens in hyper-liberal havens like Sweden where the genders polarize even more than they do in less socialist societies. \nDon't argue for or against things you don't fully understand. You make whoever you think you're championing look bad.",

Unlike women men could ONLY work, staying home wasn't an option unless you were rich in which case both genders had it unbelievably well. On top of that, there hasn't been laws against women working in terms west for so long that it can be argued they just didn't want to, not that they couldn't. Jobs women want are relatively new, no<b>  woman</b> was mad they were home instead of gettin<b> g blac</b>k lung in the coal mines.\nTo sit here and suggest women ever had it worse, when their \"plight\" consists mainly of life not being hard enough for them is stunningly dense and honestly getting ve<b> ry o</b>ld.\nThe day I see more women than men in labor jobs, workplace death statistics, dangerous jobs, STEM and infrastructure jobs and administration jobs, I'll believe that they were actually held back. As long as women keep taking the jobs that were always readily available to them and behaving the way they always have while complaining about it not being easy enough to get jobs they DON'T want or socialize they way they DON'T want to socialize, I'll continue to think feminism is the joke turned social cancer that it is.

If you care to check, men have been subjected t<b> o sexis</b>m(the name for it <b> is misand</b>ry) going all the way back to radio programs in the 1930s. Programs like The Life of Riley, Dagwood, The Great Gildersleeve, Our Miss Brooks, My Little Margie, and others, these just came to mind, represented men as bafoons, inept, unintelligent, unaware, etc. In addition, movies subverted scripts from books to advance the same dogma. The series of movies starring Bonita Granville taken from the Nancy Drew books were some of the most egregious. Early TV shows transplanted many of the misandranious radio programs to the new medium, but also doubled down on this demeaning of men in many of the new family based sitcoms. About the only programming the that did not engage in the piling on of men were the westerns. Is it any wonder that in most of the homes I was familiar with as a child, if the Father was home, and the TV was on, a western was being viewed. I am sure that there are others, but the only family TV programs I can recall that had a positive image of males were:My Three Sons, The Courtship of Eddie's Father, and Family Affair. Ironically, none of these programs had a female lead!",

It is obvious from the erroneous examples you present that you were indoctrinated by some one with no knowledge of the facts of our country's history. Let me start with the vote. Not all males were permitted to vote. The Constitution stipulated that only men over the <b> age </b>of 21, who were married, and owned land, were permitted to vote. This was argued at the Constitutional convention because it was believed that only such individuals, could be trusted, not to place people in office who would irresponsibly steward the taxpayers' money. It is my belief that women getting the vote was the beginning of the welfare state we suffer under now! As to a woman's place in society my Mother used to say I do not want equality with men. I do want to step down from my throne. As you snicker at the denigration of males and claim that female oppression is far greater, do you have a draft card? If sent into combat would accept an involuntary abortion so that you could fulfill your enlistment  contract. Upon filing for divorce are you willing to only take what you brought into the marriage plus a share of what the two of you earned proportionally divided based on each of your monetary contributions? Are you willing to abandon the archaic, and patriarchal gratuity of alimony? Are you willing to accept a child custody system where 50 per cent of the time the mother gets custody and 50 per cent of the time the father gets custody?  These are just a few of the ways men are exploited regularly in this country. But<b>  nobody</b> notices it because they are conditioned to believe that this is the way it should be! I do not believe you want equality, I believe you want the right to pick and choose what signifies equality to you and push to the side of your plate those things you don't believe make you equal enough. You seem to be oblivious to the fact that men frequently do NOT get to make those kind of choices. All the while you expect to be provided all of the courtesies traditionally extended to women. Pardon me mame but you<b> r misandr</b>y is showing!",

Girls also tend to be more focused and competitive than their male counter parts. Often the boys are unaware that they are being competed with by the girls.

White, Men v. Women, You<b> ng v</b>. Old, etc.\n\nOf all of the Marxist tactics, the most enduring, insidious and difficult to reverse (IMO) \u00a0is feminism. \u00a0\n\nMany women believe the lies of the Feminists. \u00a0They really believe that 50 years ago was housewife hell for all women but this is untrue. \u00a0While I'm sure many women have heard horror stories of men cheating on their wives and wife abuse this is untrue for the vast majority of marriages. \u00a0\n\nWomen, post WWII, had flexible career choices because most men were paid a healthy wage and the cost of living was doable within one income. \u00a0Even with this economic arrangement, by 1962, before feminism, about 1/2 of women held some form of employment. \u00a0Many women volunteered and work part time and were involved in their respective church and community activities.\n\nThis is what is hated by cultural Marxism and they sought to disrupt this. \u00a0A contented society would immediately reject cultural Marxism but the economic conditions of the 1970's is what really help to usher in Feminism.\n\nThis was because of the oil shocks cause by the U.S. support of Israel and the resulting inflation that hurt manufacturing and started the outsourcing trend.\n\nMost American workers are blue collar and only about 25% of the population have a college degree. \u00a0Thus \"middle America\" was the most effected by the neo-liberal policies put into effect. \u00a0These policies , that favored the FIRE sector over the productive and household sectors,\u00a0force women into the workforce because the inflation and outsourcing of the 1970's meant that one man's salary could not support a family and women had to go to work.\n\nWomen going into the workforce then be<b> came </b>a zero sum game and put women in a position of having to compete against men for jobs. Because of this competition, Feminists pushed for legal changes that disenfranchised all men\u00a0under the rubric of \"equality\" but the real aim was economic and social dislocation, disruption and discontent.\n\nWhat makes feminism difficult to combat is that now after 40 years, women feel that they are \"independent\" and have economic \"freedom\" and they are not about to place themselves in an economically \"dependent\" positio<b> n. \u00a0The</b> gender bending rhetoric is about brainwashing women to retain this arrangement of careerism and worker-bees in the workforce and not to submit to family.\n\nI hear exactly what 10-Double-Mike is saying about white men. \u00a0And he is right. \u00a0In fact whites are in serious trouble WRT their population numbers. \u00a0They are in a steady decline and have been so for the past 40 years. \u00a0White nationals are not exaggerating when they talk about \"genocide\". \u00a0 \u00a0On the <b> flipsi</b>de black women embrace of feminism has resulted in an illegitimacy rate of 72% with on<b> ly 10%</b> of black families intact. \u00a0In the 1960's when Daniel P. Moynihan voiced concern<b>  about</b> the black family the illegitimacy rate was 29% <b> with 7</b>0% of black families intact.\n\nWhat is now called \"second wave\" feminism is the outgrowth of cultural Marxism and involved three main subgroup: marxists, lesbians, and abused women.\n\nMarxists like Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Bella <b> Abzug, e</b>tc.\n\nLesbian like Andrea Dworkin having a visceral hatred of men. \u00a0Lesbianism<b>  is where</b> th<b> e misan</b>dry and gender bending of feminism truly originates.\n\nAbused women like Oprah Winfrey became popular blaming men for women's issue. In other words women have no agency. \u00a0The high rate<b>  of AI</b>DS in the Black community is blamed on men \"on the down low\" rather than female agency of feminist promiscuity.\n\nI can go on but it would seem the USA is more like the \"USSA\" (a bolshevik perversion) than the republic the founders had intended.",

Meaning that over commitment to his role as provider caused stress in the marriage, and estrangement from his children. He became <b> nothing </b>more than a paycheck and was resented when he tried to step outside of that role. Women today have embarked on the same folly. The CEO of PepsiCo is a<b>  woman</b>. Recently she  admonished women to count the costs of pursuing a career. Some women were incensed by being told that truth about this feminist sacred cow. Their defense was predictable, they said it was possible to, indeed, have it all! What they encouraged women to do was exactly what they had previously rebuked men for doing. Focus on your career. Have your husband stay at home and care for the child, they usually have only one, unless they waited too long and had to have invitro fertilization done. The problem is that Sweden has been way ahead of US on this foolishness. They have done long range studies on the role reversal family. Women's life expectancy declined in the initial studies by five years or more. Ironically, the expectation that the house husband would receive a comparable gain was replaced by a decline in his life expectancy as well.

I believe I can illuminate your assertion of women leaving the home to enter the work force. Prior to 1977 the price of the average house in a community was the amount the average male could earn in a year in that community. When my husband and I were first married his first full year's income was $21,000. We went looking for a house, there were dozens for us to choose from. After an extended layoff my husband enlisted in the Army for three years in 1975. In December of 1977 there was a government shutdown. As part of the legislation that ended the shutdown was the formation of Fanny Mae which opened the public purse for people unable to qualify for a  conventional home loan to buy a house. Another part of this deal with the devil was a provision that permitted FDIC member institutions to consider the income of both husband and wife when making a home loan. Here to fore, these institutions were permitted to consider the income of only one wage earner in the family. Pregnancy and child rearing could cause an interruption in the income of the wife and create a financial crisis for a family and loss for the lender. The feminists really pushed this one. They wanted a house that reflected their status and a significant asset to leverage in the property settlement when she decided to divorce. Within six months the cost of the median house in America DOUBLED! The realtors figured that there was no point of allowing the buyers to reap the benefits of this change. When we were shopping for our first home there were dozens of houses available for less than $24,000. Today the average cost of a house in our community is $210,000. My husband's annual income is about $90,000. This bill was signed into law by Jimmy Carter.",

You may have remembered him as an Obama advisor.\n\nDuring his tenure he raised interest rate to the the whopping level of 21%! \u00a0This is why usury and the FED are pure evil. \u00a0This was done by the FED to squeeze out inflation but what it did was to put the US into a deep recession and killed manufacturing in the US.\n\nVolcker's aim was to reduce the standard of living of all Americans in favor of the FIRE sector. \u00a0This created an enormous wealth transfer from the household and productive sectors of our society to the FIRE sector and was the real basis for Reagan's 80's economic boom. However the dislocation was enormous especially the \"middle\" America as jobs began to be outsources while Wall Street merged and purged manufacturing companies.\n\nCarter also started the deregulation trend with the deregulation of the transportation sector. \u00a0The deregulation of the airlines degraded the quality of airlines flights that are still felt to this day. \u00a0It killed venerable firms like Pan Am and Eastern Airlines.\u00a0\n\nTax cuts for the top income tier began under Carter -- not Reagan. \u00a0Although now I know better and the reason why we have the Income Tax is to pay the interest on the debt based money we receive from the FED. \u00a0This is why the Left fights against cutting taxes for the rich. \u00a0It's because Marxists and the banks are in bed together. \u00a0The banks want huge deficits and Marxist want the Welfare state.\n\nBut in the middle of all of this is U.S. support for Israel which has us now fighting wars perpetually in the Middle East since 9-11. \u00a0And the media wants everyone to fall in love with the TV show Homeland so that the public won't even conceive the fact that Israel was involved in the attack on the USA as well as the Kennedy Assassination.\n\nFrom USA to USSA that is where we are today. \u00a0Don't let anyone call it \"Fascist\". The USA is Bolshevik.\u00a0\n\nTake the time to research \"Cultural Marxism\" -- and that is just the beginning -- you'll begin to put this puzzle together. \u00a0\n\nAlso, I commend you husband's service but unfortunately his service was to the USSA rather than to the USA. \u00a0The good news is that I think many servicemen are beginning to see through the facade. \u00a0The Constitution is hanging on by a thread -- literally.",

And despite a two front War against Egypt's huge army with all of the latest Soviet armaments the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, gave Israeli military the victory. And a peace treaty with Egypt that had lasted until Obama engaged in regime change in Egypt that lead to the Muslim Brotherhood taking over.

Michael Jones. \u00a0He has a new book coming out called Barren Metal. \u00a0His take on Capitalism is to describe it as state sponsored usury. \u00a0\n\nThe book will be coming out very soon. \u00a0I've already pre-ordered.",

You should be <b> old </b>enough to know better than that. Tragically, many both males and females, in the feminist movement believe that in all things males and females are exactly the same, and therefore, interchangeable in all things. Do you believe that? I certainly hope not. Sadly, this ideologically driven absurdity creates situations that harm both men and women at the same time. If a man is working at a job that requires a great deal of physical strength and a<b>  woman</b> is hired for the same job, if she finds herself in a situation where she is unable to complete the task at hand, but wants to save face, so she asks a male coworker to either help her, or perform the task for her, is this fair? They both get the same pay but someone else is doing her work for her is she justified in demanding the same pay as the men who help her when she can't cut it? And, yes, I have worked at jobs where this has routinely happened.",

I'll explain why I'm still arguing, but I'll leave out the vulgarity and disrespect, since I didn't realize you were trying to make a useful point until you actually did. Even though I agree with you in some aspects, I noticed a few mistakes that I think I should point out.\n\n\"During this entire discussion I never directed any vulgarity at any single person.\" That's believable and that can be easily proven valid, yet you seem to lack the <b> mental </b>capacity to acknowledge that vulgarity and affronting opines are interchangeable in terms of lacking 'reasoning skills', 'respect', and possessing a 'deep-seated<b>  mental</b> illness'. Those quotes and references you used to link to your new argument are authenticated as literal hypocrisy, especially after you spewed this out; \"It is really a pity that your mind has been so poisoned.\" , \"Hermaphrodites are unfortunate freaks of nature\". I do understand your point on unnecessary attacks for defamation to a conflicting faction or a person who just simply disagrees, but to evince the sophomoric behavior you conveyed, you shouldn't be surprised at the use of blasphemy, especially while unremittingly pursuing the 'discussion' to that extent, despite previous entailments requesting the exact opposite. By the declaration of baseless claims, you have proven yourself quite quarrelsome again, since I haven't made a clear indication if I am a Feminist, <b> a Misogynis</b>t, or an Equalist, so, to clear up confusion, I admit I am an Equalist. I wouldn't have replied originally, but I concluded that I should let you know why I would have done so in the first place.",

How hard is it to make coffee?\n\n9. I'd say this one is definitely sexist. However typically in those days, it would be the man's car as men were the workers. It's not distrust of her being a<b>  woman</b>, but her not being the owner of the car. I wouldn't trust somebody else to drive MY car regardless of anything.\n\n8. HORRIBLY SEXIST. OH DEAR GOD.\n\n7. It's telling two sides of the story. She says \"just like a man\" as quickly as he says \"just like <b> a woma</b>n.\" You could also use this as an example <b> of sexi</b>sm against men for him being unreasonable. I'd say they're relationship is the issue here. That guy's a dick.\n\n6. Yeah pretty sexist.\n\n5. They're advertising Tab to women obviously by using the diet angle. I wouldn't call this sexist as quickly as I would call it lazy advertising. If this is sexist, then the women buying the product based on the ad campaign <b> are sex</b>ism enablers. There is definitely a social pressure on women to be beautiful. There's no doubt about that, but you wouldn't<b>  cry se</b>xism if they were advertising diet products to men. Really this ad is telling women to be mindful of the fact that men want to be with an attra<b> ctive </b>woman. To all the women out there, wouldn't your ideal man also be attractive?\n\n4. Okay this one is a little sexist with the w<b> ay the</b> woman is directed to act. \"oh poor me. I fucked up my only responsibility and that was making coffee\"\u00a0\n\n3. I think women who call men sexist for the way they attract women don't understand how hard it is out there. How incredibly difficult it is to take the exact right steps to attract a female. We're desperat<b> e for </b>a woman's attention.\u00a0The subtext in this ad isn't that women are flakes. It's saying \"Hey men. We know how impossible it is to attract a women, but here's a product that may or may not get your that much closer to achieving that goal.\" I don't like how the host sets up the clip either. The greased hair look back then was the style, and america at the time had an atmosphere of conformity. It's easy to mock something like that in retrospect, but yes, women were attracted to men with greased hair back then. Look at any male H<b> olly</b>wood sex symbol from the day. Same hair.\n\n2. Watch the actual ad. You can find it somewhere on youtube. This channel took it out of context. It's a Pepsi ad, and it's not sexist at all.\n\n1. Never seen the ad, but based on what you guys showed, I'm just having a hard time analyzing whether or not it's sexist.",

If this is sexist, then there are thousands more commercials that are sexist against men because how often do you see a man portrayed as stupid and a<b>  woman</b> as smart? ALL THE DAMN TIME.\nIf you count a man hitting <b> a woma</b>n on television not portrayed in a bad way <b> as sexi</b>sm and \"promoting violence against women\", then reverse the genders, make the commercial into color, and get better quality, and you get a perfectly normal modern day commercial. Why isn't this sexist? I think we all know the answer to that\nSome of these are legitimately sexist towards women, most are only sexist according to whiny feminists who whine about every little thing that doesn't go their way.",

Yes, some women that have annoying personalities complain about irrelevant things, and some men do the exact same thing. Yes there are differences, women can give birth, women have periods, women don't have penis's. Men don't have breasts, men are typically physically stronger than women\u00a0 (not in all cases). But i just don't understand why we define somebody's character and personality, by what <b> sexual </b>organs they have? If you meet a<b>  woman</b>, you treat her with respect and that i<b> s commo</b>n curtsey and also basic manners, but if th<b> at wom</b>an turns out to be a total jerk, then yeah, that person may lose your respect. Vice versa with men also. But what i don't like, is when somebody will then use a gendered term to describe the person who is maybe being rude, like using the word 'bitch' or 'dick', and then continue to define the person by th<b> eir gen</b>der. Its like when my friend was being bullied because of how she looks, i stuck up for her and i told them there isnt any need to hate or abuse somebody for no valid reason. I was then called a bitch and asked if it was my time of the month by the men that were verbally attacking her. I don't really know how to explain it any further, without mentioning how women have been oppressed for so very long, and society does still hold those certain traits. Just 30 years ago, in England, women were not allowed to work in the same police task force as men, so they were put in the womens department which handled very minute public problems and maybe medical emergencies. They also had to wear a different uniform, a skirt and heels. Yeah some men do get grief from some women about how they treat them with disrespect, but if they do act sexist, then shouldnt women complain<b> ? If no</b>body compla<b> ined, no</b>thing would change. The suffragettes and suffragists complained, fought and risked their lives just so they could vote. Just so they could vote. Also i would like to point out, why can we not idolize women? Certain women do deserve to be idolized, like Marylin Monroe and J.K Rowling. ALSO, ARE YOU TELLING ME MEN IN GENERAL HAVE NEVER ASSUMED OR DEMANDED THAT WOMEN SHOULD DO THINGS FOR THEM? HAVE YOU HEARD OF RAPE CULTURE AND PO<b> RN A</b>ND SEX SLAVES AND SEXUALIZED ADVERTS AND BEAUTY STANDARDS FOR WOMEN? Why do i have to be less hostile for my point to be heard? Why do you think women are hostile? Why do you think that every time i walk down the street i feel unsafe if i walk past a man even though i have never experienced an unsafe situation with one? Why do you think feminism exists? IM NOT SAYING THAT THIS IS DIRECTED AT MEN, BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHY THERE ARE FEMINISTS AND WHY WE CAN'T JUST FORGET HOW WOMEN WERE TREATED NOT EVEN 30 YEARS AGO?!? Dont you DARE pers<b> onify a</b> gender, and dont you DARE\u00a0 describe women on the internet as 'hostile' when the whole reason there is feminism, is because there has been a hostility towards women for thousands of years. I think you need to take a leaf out of your own book, stop being a biased moron, and maybe research why we may perceive women to be 'bitches' and how they 'complain' so fucking much. I am a<b>  15 </b>year old girl, and i do definitely have so much more to learn, but one thing i do know is to NEVER generalize ANYTHING and to NEVER define someones personalit<b> y by</b> what sex they are. Don't even reply to this, because i have restrained for so long on this subject, trying to emphasize with misogynistic people and ignorant people and arrogant people and misandric people. Dont reply to this with the sort of essay i have just written, because i will be to tired to reply back with another huge paragraph. Good night.",

We are saying that the women that speak the loudest in the news, on blogs, and in the public's eye tend to complain instead of actually doing anything.\n\nThe feminists of today are not the same as the feminists of 30 years ago. The loudest speaking feminists of today don't want equality, they want to be above men. They hate men just as much as they claim men hate women.\n\nWhen I said idolize women, I didn't mean individual people. It's fine to look up to your heroes. The two ladies you mentioned were very successful, and I encourage you to be as, if not more, successful in your life. What I meant, when I said what I did, was that a lot of people today idolize the female<b>  gender</b>. They assume any and all women are the good guys in an argument, when it could very well be either party.\n\nYou are more than welcome to disagree with me, Lauren. And I do encourage you to think for yourself. Fact check everyone, and indeed judge them by their actions not their words or looks.\n\nGood night.",

A feminist is someone who believes in equal rights for men and women on a social, financial, political ect level. The feminists (men or women) who are demanding hierarchy aren't feminists. They are probably misandrists. But what bugs me, is whenever i mention feminism i constantly get belittled by people saying feminists are all 'lesbians' 'bitches' and that they want to just control men. Its like how maybe some Muslims are seen as terrorists for being Muslim. I feel like people can be sexist without realizing it, like maybe a guy calling their friend a girl because they cant do something physically or mentally as well as they can. I have witnessed it so much. And what is even worse is schools dont teach us kids about this.",

Its not that she made him bad coffee, its the fact that he expects her to make coffee and when she takes the time to make it for him, he tells her its crap. I understand not having good coffee, but if he knew his wife made bad coffee, why not make it himself.\u00a0\n\nNow imagine this, in a world where women don't complain, you happen to be a <b> woman.</b> So if a man slapped you around and you had to do as he commands no matter what, how would you deal with it knowing you can't complain about it and you have little to no rights? Not so good. I think its quite easy for men to say women should be this way or that way as if they were meaningless pets with no brains, as they aren't women. Men shouldn't be dictating how they want women to be like or how they should live, same goes for women.

When you listen to this video and consider that the title is top 10 most sexist commercials it is beyond hypersensitive to call these male female interactions sexist. My point was that if the genders exchanged dialogue in these ads it would have been fine with the Feminazis. But given this hypersensitivity about female portrayals in the media where is the outrage over the denigration of males?

Her self-concept was tied to the kitchen, not her actual value as a person. The last one refers to shopping as her competitive sport (jokingly). Similar to the coffee ads, it links women as THE family shoppers and mocks their actual physical abilities, although women ran track, played ranked tennis, and more, and now participate is most of the world's sports. The other one where the man whistles at a<b>  woman</b> and he's won her over!\u00a0 I think that commercial combines shallow people an<b> d sexis</b>m. If you believe she had an equal choice to go with him, then I see how it doesn't seem sexist, but for the most part, men called the shots in those days, and women based their value on that kind of attention from men. Some people still do, it's now seen as a reflection of low self-esteem. Then, it was the primary social order. Personally, I find it insulting if a man whistles in my direction and expects me to pay attention to him. Whistling to me is for dogs.

Men didn't have to aspire to marriage, unlike women did, and they could explore any aspect of life that they so desired.\nGo back far enough in history, and you'll see just how stupid it is.

And why was this done to her? no reason. In fact, her 'owner' had given her to the men that wanted to pursue (and possibly kill) him. She was raped, and was killed during the rape, and then he cut her into 12 pieces.\nThe very notion of God being a man is sexist in and of itself.",

But it does seem like for a very long time women didn't have the power to do much, hence why I called them suppressed.\nand the 'poor victim' idea was always around, I think. It's not always true, but since most women aren't as strong as men, and also because of certain stereotypical characteristics (the idea that women aren't as bold, or meek) makes them seem like victims in a situation. This has an evolutionary advantage, however - I'm sure in a dangerous scenario, this mindset was adapted in men in order to 'save the woman' and keep her alive for reproductions' sake.\nBut I totally agree with you. Women are now far more 'touchy' on these topics than they used to be.",

Oh, even if I am not picture perfect, I still attract plenty of men. I am busy to avoid stares, not all that subtle. I do not enjoy those. In fact, I distain them.\nI got approached by total strangers in the weirdest and most unsuitable situations. Also, a no thank you - I am not interested - should be efficient enough, don't you all agree? Well, think again. That this is not enough, not at all has been shown to me to many times.\n\nOne time, not that long ago, I was taking the tram home. I was listening to music (with my headphones on) and my cellphone in my hands.\nA young men got on the tram and sat in front of me. I briefly looked, as I would normally. Well, my uber sexy ways and my intense flirting (I was wearing a scarve, winter jacket, cap) - attention sarcasm sarcasm - must put him in a state of arousal. I really gave him the death stare and then tried to focus on my text. And YES, he finally showed signs to get up and leave. He went outside and guess what, decided to turn around in the last second and grace me with his presence again. And well, he was doing a michael jackson uuuh uuh. THEN I really got mad and screamed and left my seat. So the ignoring did noooothing at all, my sour and angry grimmasses did not either. But am I am to blame? And why do I get bothered with some idiot like that. Where is the respect for ME?\nWhy does he think, he can do that? And if you asked him, was he aware of the fact, that he was harassing me? Or did he still think I was game???\n\nlast saturday, a club concert. my friends and me dancing. I began to notice someone was moving closer. well, how do I put this \u00e4hmm - i am not a native speaker, so I do not now how to exactly express everything correctly - I felt something behind my back. At first I thought...well I do have a little bag, that sure feels like a bag. Let me say....it was not.\nI decided to move more to the right. And guess who also moved.\nThere where three guys behind us, just as close as they could possibly could get. I mean, people (men, women) around as that where enjoying the concert were really dancing. Those three, later 4 men were just disgusting. And again, WHY do I have to endure something like that? And why should we (well, I was not the only women getting disturbed) just brush it off and say, \"oh well, some guys...creeps...\"\n\nin summer, we went to something that showcase <b> african </b>art (and kitsch) and food and music. I was approached by one guy. I was<b>  dumb</b> enough to be friendly and not shut him up at the very first opportunity.\nI was with my friends, but at that time only my friend and me were looking around to look around the marketstands. He was following me for a good 15 minutes. Okay, he might not get, that I am not interested at the first time, when I am still polite and friendly. But for gods sake, do I have to yell and scream every time? Do I have to make up a boyfriend every time so that a men does take my NO for serious?\n\nI wonder if you (men) ever have to think about one of the above issues. or have to deal with any of those situations. Those were just at the top of my head.\n\nAlso, I think about getting at home at night in a safely manner.\nOr if you have discussions about how to avoid assaults or to survive them.\n\nI have not began to speak about unequality (done to me in a first world country nor women in much more unsafe surroundings). But for now, I think the every da<b> y sexis</b>m me and other women are facing is enough for me.\n\nOh and youtube is the perfect place f<b> or sexi</b>sm. Very often, when I dare to differ, I get insulted with bitch, whore, cunt etc. etc. etc.\nI have this seen plenty of times done to other women (when identifiable as such) too.\n\nI don't think men have it easier then women. But I will be dammned if someone will try to shut me up because what I am saying is not worth mentioning in the opinion of a self entitled meninist.\n\nI am not interested in COMPARING, I cannot emphasize this enough.\ntwo wrongs don't make a right!",

Yes we could argue that legally it isnt allowed to discriminate, but there are SO many things that women cant do because it is considered unacceptable...\n\nWhen I say 'one man/<b> woman </b>being a jerk', let's use the following example:\nA man and a<b>  woman</b> are walking on a crowded sidewalk. Th<b> e woma</b>n abruptly cuts off the man and he trips. Now how likely is it that he is going to call her a bitch [gendered]? Pretty likely. And if he is of a certain mindset (MRA/misogynist), then he is going to use that later on as an example of 'misandry', and how women are horrible.\nOkay, so now a man a<b> nd wom</b>an are walking on a crowded sidewalk. The man abruptly cuts of <b> the wo</b>man and she trips. What does she do? I don't know. Maybe she is like, wow, what an asshole [not gendered]. Or more likely, because of factors like rape culture and violence against women, she's not going to say anything, but will keep walking. Who knows, she might not think anything of it at all, and keep walking.\nAdditionally, she's probably going to forget about the incident very quickly. If a discussion a<b> bout miso</b>gyny comes up later in the day, that would be the last thing on her mind of things to reference.\nonce again, see the difference?",

My mum would try to discuss with me about how she is annoyed that women are only paid 75p to a mans 1pound. I used to brush this off with a 'if women wanted better pay then they would get it, its because they have children, it isnt mens fault girls become pregnant so young' That was only a year ago, and i changed so much in my opinions. I started to look into things more deeply, and when i was aware why women want to fight for respect, i couldnt help but laugh at how ignorant i was. People change so many times as they go on in life, and i have decided that this will be my very last try at trying to open peoples minds. From now on i will tackle <b> sexism </b>on a personal level, because what else can i do. I cant prevent the millions of rape/sexual assault cases that will be filed this year. Maybe when i am older that is what i will try to stop.

Do women HAVE to be<b>  sex</b> symbols? Can they not be taken seriously in their field of work? And besides, this view is completely subjective. It may be a turn off for you, but that doesn't make it so for everyone.\nthis is human nature\nWhat do you mean by human nature; the biology of the sexes, or the history? Because historically, women have been treated like shit; no positions in anything. Very boring lives, I can imagine. No jobs, no status, no power and they were probably expected to be innocent, so no enjoyin<b> g se</b>x either. After all, its the sperm of the man that is required in reproduction, not the orgasm of t<b> he wom</b>an. Although women were protected more (and still are, and this isn't a bad thing, due to the biology of the sexes) they would not be able to do ANYTHING else. Take a look at Israeli society; i<b> f a wo</b>man gets raped, give her to the rapist! He must marry her! No thought whatsoever to the terrible experience the girl must be having. In fact, you can even sell your daughter as a slave to another man! fun times!\nBiologically, yes, men have more testosterone, thus making them more physically adept at certain things. However, women can multitask better. Women also have bodies that are very good for nourishing a growing human being, for the task of birth. So yes, women have the fundamental task of producing and continuing life. But the idea that such social stigmas like 'women and politics don't go together' should be propagated is not supported by any biological evidence, at all. They're inherently social and developed because of ignorant and stupid human beings.",

The women and men who claim to be feminists but just want hierarchy ect, ARENT feminists, they are misandrist, and a lot of people mistake that. You are a feminist because you think women and men are equal in alot of aspects and should be treated so! Im not talking about legal limitations. There are alot of limitations that girls are forced to believe they have, and boys are forced to believe they should enforce. I think a lot of it is <b> gender </b>roles, like boys are brought up to like fast cars, the color blue, soldiers; girls are brought up to be obsessed with looks and pink and princesses. Whereas thats okay for either<b>  gender</b> to like, what isnt okay is they don't get much of a choice and then when say a boy may be more 'feminine' he would get bullied because acting 'like a girl' is degrading, which is kind of insulting to both genders, which is wher<b> e Homophobi</b>a also comes in. I'm more buzzed off about the social side <b> of sexi</b>sm. There are alot of idiots who will call a girl a 'slut' for hav<b> ing </b>sex a lot, and then in turn call a guy a 'lad'. Yeah it depends on the individual person, but there are limitations that are believed to be real by people who arent as educated on the matter. Yeah were biased, but only because were women. If we were men you may not mention us being biased at all and maybe congratulate us on our open minds. Lets just set aside<b>  all ge</b>nder, and come back to where you mentioned 'women and politics dont mix'. That there, is a limitation you personally just set. And though you call us biased, you also are, because you havent experienced life as a female and that is totally okay, but be more understanding as to why feminism exists. I feel as though feminism gets dismissed or misunderstood more than other things to do with social or legal status',<b>  li<b> k</b</b>>e gay rights (which are both completely two different causes) and if someone were to mention they <b> sup<b> p</b</b>>ort gay people they would in most cases get praised on their moral grounds, as to where someone (mostly women) would mention she is a feminist would be verbally attacked and<b>  called </b>a lesbian or a misandrist by mostly men or ignorant women who arent clued up as to why they are constantly hyper-sexualised or called a bitch and asked if they are on their period in a rude way everytime they are angry. Its like me telling some<b> one wh</b>o is black that they don't have any limitations and that there isnt any discrimination any more. And yeah i get it, there are women who over exaggerate everything and get angry about things and , but thats not because they are feminist, its because they are most likely a jerk.",

Most of them sit behind open faced or clear desks so if you're a man you can ogle their legs and tight fitting dresses. They only wear short shirts! Their roles in any comedy program is to laugh, jiggle, wear slutty clothes and act as <b> dumb </b>as rocks! It's so oppressive to see them reduced to<b>  sexual</b> objects for men to lust over. And in their culture women constantly complete. Parties end up looking like whore conventions. All the women wearing outfits that are inappropriate for the occasion, while the men dress like farmers! Or cowboys! It's surrealistic. Like you stepped out of 2013 into an alternate universe!!!! CREEPY AS HELL!...",

All the nice guys either gave up or never married and raised polite kids for the next generation. I think it is important to realize just how this absurd movement is impacting society",

Except that I'm atheist & as such, to me, your claims of god, bible, etc. are simply worthless bs that have no place in this kind of discussion.",

Just because it's increasing doesn't mean it's positive or have positive effects. In fact it has negative effects. Divorce. It depends on what job you have if the father can leave work to be with their new born. I already said if they are contributing to the relationship it's not leeching. Doing the dishes and making beds is not work if it's in your own home... lol",

Because, as far as I know, the number of stay at home dads is increasing and role reversal, in fact, is becoming quite popular; just as dads nowadays increasingly take time off after the birth of their child(ren), whereas it used to only be women in the past.\nThat said, I wouldn't consider a <b> woman </b>who stays at home doing housework, cooking and taking care of children as leeching.
