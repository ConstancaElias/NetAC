        "postText": "Senior Labour figures have been accused of obstructing investigations into anti-Semitism claims, according to BBC Panorama.', 'In a programme airing tonight, communications chief and Jeremy Corbn ally Seumas Milne and National Constitution Committee general secretary Jennie Formby are singled out for criticism.', 'Labour has denied the claims and has written a complaint to the BBC.', 'A total of eight former Labour officials spoke to Panorama, including four who say they have signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) on the subject of anti-Semitism.', 'Dan Hogan, who was an investigator in the disputes team, alleged people brought in by Ms Formby since her appointment \u2018overruled\u2019 his group.', 'He said they \u2018downgraded what should\u2019ve been a suspension to just an investigation or worse to just a reminder of conduct, effectively a slap on the wrist.\u2019', 'Former head of disputes Sam Matthews said he interpreted an email from Mr Milne as \u2018not a helpful suggestion\u2019 but as \u2018an instruction\u2019.', 'The BBC reports that, in the email from March last year, Mr Milne said there should be a review of the disciplinary process into anti-Semitic complaints.', 'He is said to have written: \u2018Something\u2019s going wrong and we\u2019re muddling up political disputes with racism.', '\u2018I think going forward we need to review where and how we\u2019re drawing the line.\u2019', 'The BBC suggests anti-Semitism complaints within the party have increased significantly since Mr Corbyn became leader in 2015, but is yet to release any numbers.', 'Testimony from whistleblowers includes allegations there were substantial disagreements within the party about what constituted anti-Semitism.', 'By 2016 Kat Buckingham, the former chief investigator in the disputes team, says the problem of anti-Semitism complaints was \u2018massive\u2019 and \u2018real\u2019.', 'She says it \u2018wasn\u2019t constructed by embittered old Blairites as we were frequently described as\u2019.', 'Ms Buckingham told BBC Panorama she had a breakdown and decided to leave the Labour Party.', 'She said: \u2018I was stuck between an angry and obstructive Leader\u2019s Office and an arcane disciplinary system.', '\u2018I couldn\u2019t hold the tide and I felt so powerless and I felt guilty and I felt like I failed\u2026and yeah I had a breakdown.\u2019', 'Louise Withers Green,a former disputes officer, left the Labour Party after being signed off with depression and anxiety.', 'In return for not having to work her notice period she signed an NDA, but she still decided to speak to the BBC.', 'Louise said: \u201c[The NDA] was really tight. When I first read it, I wondered how on earth, I\u2019d be able to apply for jobs because it was so prescriptive in not speaking about anything that I had heard of or happening in the Labour Party.\u201d', 'One person said complaints were processed directly by aids in Mr Corbyn\u2019s Westminster office on one occasion, according to the documentary.', 'Labour, which has been braced for the accusations, wrote to BBC director-general Lord Hall to complain ahead of the broadcast.', 'A party spokesman accused the broadcaster of \u2018pre-determining\u2019 the outcome of its investigation.', 'He said: \u2018The Panorama programme and the BBC have engaged in deliberate and malicious representations designed to mislead the public.', '\u2018We completely reject any claim that the Labour Party is anti-Semitic.', '\u2018Labour is taking decisive action against anti-Semitism, doubling the number of staff dedicated to dealing with complaints and cases.', '\u2018It appears these disaffected former officials include those who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, worked to actively undermine it, and have both personal and political axes to grind.', '\u2018This throws into doubt their credibility as sources.', '\u2018Our records show that after these officials left and after Jennie Formby became general secretary, the rate at which anti-Semitism cases have been dealt with, increased more than four-fold.\u2019', 'A BBC spokesman accused Labour of \u2018criticising a programme they have not seen\u2019.', 'He said: \u2018The programme adheres to the BBC\u2019s editorial guidelines.', '\u2018In line with those, the Labour Party has been given the opportunity to respond to the allegations.\u2019",
