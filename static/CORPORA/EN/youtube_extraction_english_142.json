Those bullies do that because they can get away with it and typically the only actions you can take in those situations make things worse. They want you to break so they can gaslight the shit out of you. It's honestly terrifying some people operate like that. The fact that you recognized what was going on and maintained a degree of composure in the workplace is commendable.\n\nMay you never have to deal with anyone like that ever again!",

Before the whole layoff ordeal I knew a few people who were cool hipster weirdos and liked similar music, we would trade songs and take turns DJing. I got to pick the music at team gatherings usually. That was the only time I'd worked with people who were anything like me though. It really is just a matter of chance.",
