        "postText": "Behold, the worst thing on the internet today: \u2018Daddy\u2019s Sticker Chart\u2019.', '\u2018Daddy\u2019s Sticker Chart\u2019 is the name of a piece of paper that provides tasks for a \u2018daddy\u2019 to do in exchange for rewards.', 'If he washes the dishes six times, for example, daddy gets a 12-pack of beer.', 'If he puts the toilet seat down six times, there will be \u2018no nagging for a week\u2019.', 'If he cleans the kids\u2019 vomit six times, he gets a blowjob from his wife. Interestingly enough, it\u2019s the vomit task daddy has completed the most.', 'This is awful for a whole host of reasons, beyond the mysterious message of \u2018baby sideburns\u2019 in the bottom right corner.', 'While the chart has drawn anger all over the internet, this particular one is actually a parody of the real daddy sticker charts floating around the internet.', 'But rewarding men for doing the most basic of tasks is very much a thing.', 'Take a look at Pinterest and you\u2019ll see loads of women sharing this parody, sincerely writing \u2018I need to make my hubby one of these!\u2019.', 'One blogger created a \u2018sure, wife\u2019 chart that rewards husbands simply for not kicking up a fuss when asked to do something.', 'The idea that a man would need a sticker chart to do simple requirements of parenting, such as packing children\u2019s lunches or bathing the kids, is appalling.', '', 'Surely when a woman decides to start a family with a man, she should be able to rely on him for some of the work parenting requires. Surely she should be able to expect that her partner might deign to help raise the children he agreed to have, and he will wash the dishes and change nappies not in exchange for treats, but because he knows these are adult responsibilities he signed up for.', 'Being an adult means having very basic responsibilities. You have to clean and feed yourself. You need to turn up to your job on time.', 'When you get in a relationship, you get some new responsibilities and you share some others. You vow to be there for each other, to be kind and caring, to consider their feelings. It shouldn\u2019t be the case that all of your adult responsibilities get shifted on to your significant other, because you\u2019re still supposed to be an adult.', 'And yet all too many times, when a man gets in a relationship with a woman, he becomes her responsibility. It\u2019s her job to make him a better man, to \u2018provide\u2019 for him in terms of domestic tasks such as cooking and cleaning (because these are the women\u2019s jobs, right?), to make sure he\u2019s still existing as an adult.', 'It shouldn\u2019t be this way because that\u2019s not equality. And it\u2019s simply not fair \u2013 how can a woman keep looking after herself when she\u2019s expected to spend all her energy on a man?', 'When kids come along, even more responsibilities get added to each person\u2019s load. Too often the majority of those go on to one parent\u2026 usually the woman.', 'But we have to remember that just getting men to pick up tasks isn\u2019t success. If their wife or girlfriend has to spend time and emotional labour giving them nudges, asking them again and again, explaining why it\u2019s so important, showing them how to do things, fixing them when they\u2019re done incorrectly, or providing rewards, the scales are still uneven.', 'Men don\u2019t deserve stickers and blowjobs for being decent human beings.', 'If your partner needs to be nagged, promised rewards, or given stickers so they\u2019ll do basic tasks, you\u2019re not dating a man \u2013 you\u2019re dating an overgrown child who simply doesn\u2019t care about your needs.', 'The same applies if your boyfriend or husband needs you to do things for them because they \u2018don\u2019t know how\u2019 (and, strangely enough, can\u2019t be bothered to learn) or requires a load of effort from you in order to be able to run an errand \u2013 like needing you to hunt down images of everything on your shopping list.', 'And frankly, you need to dump him.', 'Needing and expecting to be mothered is a form of sexism. It\u2019s the idea that women have to be the nurturing, caring ones in a partnership, taking care of the man so that he can go ahead and do manly things, which relies on the assumption that women have nothing better to do than drag a manchild into adulthood at the expense of their own emotional wellbeing.', 'Dressing up that mothering with a fun chart doesn\u2019t make it any better. Neither do fun rewards, because a man shouldn\u2019t need the promise of blowjobs or beer or no nagging* for a day to get stuff done \u2013 he should do it because he knows it\u2019s the right thing to do.', '*Don\u2019t get me started on the sexism of \u2018nagging\u2019. Notice how it\u2019s only ever applied to women?', 'We have to stop letting men get away with being big kids. We have to stop thinking it\u2019s funny that our male partners can\u2019t or refuse to do basic tasks.', 'Our time is valuable, and too often we waste it doing things men are perfectly capable of, or dressing up our emotional labour in a cute little bow\u2026 which requires even more of our time and effort.', 'Women, reclaim your time. Rip up daddy\u2019s sticker sheet, tell him what needs doing, and ditch him if he can\u2019t be bothered to comply. Men don\u2019t deserve stickers and blowjobs for being decent human beings.",

            "commentText": "Actually, in 'Laugh your way to a better marriage' (an American marriage video), it is pointed out by a Pastor that <b> sex,</b> opera tickets, or beer are a much better approach to partnership than nagging, insults, outrage, or a massive sense of entitlement.  Afterall, having power struggles and demoralising your partner is fairly quickly worse than dealing with the occasional half a cup of child vomit.  I am not against Feminism in theory, but in practice at home it can sometimes turn from an expression of equality into telling some people that they should be like other people. I wouldn't rate agression as a solution over understanding that people are different, and some people, including men or women, are less domesticated; this is not even necessarily a matter of<b>  gender</b>, just that we are different for a variety of unknown reasons, and it is difficult to change.  I think that your partner should try to accomodate your wishes, but if there are things neither of you want to do, then you deserve rewards or at least appreciation - which is the British way of saying BJs.",
