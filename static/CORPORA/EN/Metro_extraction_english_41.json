        "postText": "I haven\u2019t collected much wisdom in my 26 years of life, but here\u2019s what I\u2019ve got.', 'You never need a seventh glass of wine, people who regularly quote Marilyn Monroe are unhinged, and women who claim that they \u2018don\u2019t get on\u2019 with other women because they\u2019re \u2018bitchy\u2019 are the spawn of Satan.', 'I fully admit that I\u2019m a girl\u2019s girl. Always have been, always will be. I\u2019ve talked before about how I don\u2019t have any male friends (I actually do have two, since time of publication, but the point stands).', 'So perhaps I\u2019m just extra sensitive to this trope, but honestly every single woman I\u2019ve ever heard say that she can\u2019t be friends with women has transpired to be a truly awful person.', '\u2018Girls are just so bitchy\u2019 is the traditional statement from an I Don\u2019t Get On With Girls woman (IDGOWG)', '\u2018I can\u2019t handle the drama of hanging out with women\u2019 or worst of all (just writing these words makes my fingers itch) \u2018I just find that girls are so jealous of me.\u2019', 'Excuse me while I shove my fist into my mouth and scream silently.', 'Let\u2019s be honest. If you\u2019re incapable of sustaining a friendship with other women, that\u2019s about you. Not them.', 'Look at it from a purely logical standpoint. Which is statistically more likely \u2013 that you\u2019re a special magical unicorn of womanhood who is pure and non-bitchy and all other women are evil?', 'Or that it\u2019s your own fault that women don\u2019t like you?', 'If your experience of women is that they are dramatic and bitchy and backstabbing, maybe it\u2019s because you were a problem and they reacted to you. In fact, scrap the maybe, I\u2019ll bet you twenty quid that it is.', 'Of course toxic friendship groups exist and it\u2019s entirely possible that you\u2019ve experienced nasty women. Bullying is a real problem among adults as well as among teenagers. It happens. It\u2019s understandable that you might feel burnt by an experience of being bullied by female friends.', 'But if every single female friendship group you\u2019ve ever encountered were \u2018jealous\u2019 of you, perhaps it\u2019s time for a bit of self reflection.', 'I\u2019ve got friends who look like Victoria\u2019s Secret models. Friends who earn twice what I do. Friends who succeed at everything they so much as blink at. I\u2019m not jealous of them, because they\u2019re my friends.', 'Maybe they weren\u2019t jealous, maybe you were difficult. Maybe they weren\u2019t happy for your successes because you only ever talked about yourself. Or maybe they were just keenly aware that you\u2019d rather be spending time with men.', 'Some women do prefer the company of men. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. I think it\u2019s sad for any woman to miss out on the genuine magic of female friendship, but it\u2019s a personal choice.', 'But what isn\u2019t okay is to act as if it makes you better than other women, as if you\u2019d love to be one of the girls but you\u2019re just to sweet and pure of heart to be able to handle it.', 'Women aren\u2019t inherently bitchy or jealous or back stabbing. They might talk about their feelings more, because society hasn\u2019t bullied them into having a stiff upper lip, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re any \u2018worse.\u2019 Believing things like that that is called internalised misogyny and it\u2019s both annoying and ridiculous.', 'Men are also capable of being bitchy, critical and back stabbing. Those aren\u2019t female traits. They\u2019re human traits.', 'Gender isn\u2019t a black and white (or blue and pink) divide. Men can be bitchy, women can be straight forward. Blokes can be emotional, women can be stoic. The idea that our behaviours are defined by our gender is completely illogical and it does no-one any favours.', 'Speaking of not doing anyone any favours, the myth that women, especially young women, are \u2018bitchy\u2019 is a real problem. If you teach girls that they\u2019re a gossipy manipulative bunch of backstabbers, how can you expect them to act any differently from that?', 'Just like it\u2019s not okay to bully boys into being strong, emotionless and abrasive, it\u2019s not okay to socialise young women to behave like the cast of Mean Girls.', 'While my social life isn\u2019t exactly weeping for the loss of women who would rather be hanging out with men, those sentiments do have the capacity to damage other young women.', 'So please, if you\u2019re a woman who has spent her life calling other women \u2018bitchy\u2019 and \u2018gossipy\u2019 and \u2018jealous\u2019, indulge in a little self reflection. Maybe attempt to spend some time with some other women. You never know, you might learn something about yourself.",

She is critical, and judgemental and comes across as jealous and insecure. She seems intimated by the thought of a <b> woman </b>who doesn't have a group of female friends. There is absolutely<b>  nothing</b> wrong with not having a group of women as friends, and it's not because <b> a woma</b>n is a 'problem herself' or any of the things you mentioned. You (the writer) really need to find some self esteem of your own and stop dragging other women down, you are precisely the reason women may not want to be friends with other women as you come across as such a horrible judgmental person.",
