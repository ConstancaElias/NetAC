    "commentText": "If someone was to say that all black youths in London are involved in gangs you would, like me, accuse that person of making a racist statement. And the same would apply if someone said that all Muslim men are involved in grooming young white girls. It‚Äôs not true. It isn‚Äôt right. To make such comments against a whole community or a group of people ‚Äì simply because of the behaviour of a small number of individuals ‚Äì is unjust and tantamount to racism. If you agree then consider: why a number of EU Remainers feel it is okay to accuse 17.4 million people of being racist? Why it is that certain politicians believe it is somehow just, to imply that those people who voted to leave the EU are racist? To play the race card against any group of people in this way is in itself, an act of racism and such people need to be held to account.¬† mMpGGNuh42Q",

All of whom have settled into the UK way of life and have NEVER experienced racism at all. Nor have they ever been in trouble with the Police. But there is a demographic who will only be happy when the law abiding majority of the UK allow then to behave just as they please. They are also the ones that are hugely over represented on TV and in advertising (as if we will accept them if they are rammed down our throats). Yet any criticism of them results in cries of racism and worse. Never the less Merkel and the EU thought it would be a great idea to have huge numbers of these people flood in to Europe. We have seen what has happened in Sweden, Paris and Germany. The Brexit vote was a push back against this and a chance to say no! we only want people who are of real value to the country, not just a load on the welfare and Policing system. I voted to Remain BTW.",

Also that everything else like economy and transport and businesses and jobs are also being filled by other people and elderly people are losing pensions they earned from wartime because of refugees. Lastly that  all white people are racist, wtaf is that. So you are saying homeless terminal hard working people are racist and evil and should burn because of the colour or their skin. is that what's happening? Someone, please clarify i have made lots of conclusions from topics in school and in the news. Am i right? or is some of what i said right ( these are not my opinions just stuff i gathered)\n\nAlso for those who are not understanding - SKIN COLOUR IS BASED ON AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT - if your family has lived in a country of harsh sunlight you will have dark skin (more pigment) to stop skin cancer.

The institution of the EU which these bigots want to preserve has a policy of Fortress Europe, with laws that deny access and 'free movement' to anyone outside of the EU. Perhaps this explains why thousands of migrants have died, and are dying, to get into Europe. So this includes all the black people from Africa, and asian people from around the world who do not share the same colour skin as white Europeans. Call me someone who is actually grounded in reality and knows which way is up in the world, but that sounds like the EU is a directly racist institution !",

So what if we are racist, Islamophobic and anti-immigrant? It doesn't matter as even if we are or aren't you will try and oppress and exclude people which such views. You think culture doesn't matter, that the government should enforce multi-culturalism upon the nation and stop any \"hateful\" behaviour. Comparing words to violence and banning speech. It is unjust and opposed to British history and ancestry to do such things. However the Liberals have co-opted freedom of speech to mean something totally different to what it meant after the High Tory riots in 1710 when the Whig's unjustly imprisoned Henry Sacheverell for speaking against the English Bill of Rights. Stop trying to use the media and government as social justice to enforce your will upon everybody. Leave us alone. This comes from opposition to Liberalism both progressive and classical which has ruined peoples lives and take liberty and justice from them. And before anyone calls me bigoted or whatever new insult you Liberal scum have come up with, I have an Indian Hindu girlfriend who I love more than anything and she is very worried about being deported after the vote to leave the EU. If you Liberal scum had actually cared about people in this nation and consulted them before you imported millions of foreign people then my girlfriend wouldn't be worrying about being deported, there wouldn't be any problem with immigration. I am sick of it, people want less immigrants in nation and they wish to stop and turn back demographic change which has taken place in the last 50 years. Maybe if you listened and enacted policies people wouldn't feel the need to be racist and bully other people in the street.",

And most of these racists comments come from that. People who feel they have lost power within Britain and don't feel the Liberal political parties are listening to them. And most of the rest of the time it is just an insult or bullying. So you call a disabled person a spastic or a fat person a fat bastard or someone with classes are four eyed prick. Then you have you racist insult bastard and you aren't British because you don't sound British, which in my view is a fair comment. You can't really claim to be British when you don't sound British or look British in how you dress. However the people who randomly say to people you should be deported because you aren't British, when they were born here, those people are actually a problem and we all hate them and they can fuck off.

(we have the exact same thing going on here in the US as the UK has with respect to immigration).  but we still need to look at this in the same way that a cartographer looks at a map:  with a disinterested and objective frame of mind.  To explain a little more fully, after world war 1 the victors decided to punish germany.  they were to be brought low and humiliated.  or perhaps I'm wrong.  perhaps the policy to germany was simply to ignore them.  in any event, fascism grew.  so after world war 2, some genius decided we were not going to let this happen again, and so the Marshall Plan was developed.  germany was to be remade into a modern liberal democracy.  the rest you know: germany became a successful liberal democracy...precisely because the allied powers deliberately decided not to humiliate germany again.  the takeaway for me is, don't let fascism grow.  do not humiliate the historic native stock of a nation.  If the native stock of a nation is humiliated, or rather, feels humiliated - then hit the pause button on immigration....  immediately.  on this side of the atlantic, the free trade, open borders and mass immigration love affair began about two decades ago with the signing of nafta.  and it has been open the floodgates ever since.  In 1996 about 85% of the US was white.  20 years later it is 65% white.  This is an astonishing statistic.  It is nothing more than population replacement, full stop.  by mid-century white america will be 50% of the population.  Again, this is a truly staggering thing to behold.  As an Irish American, I cannot really be against immigration.  but I can sure see how many people would be.  (as an aside, I happen to like mexican immigration. they remind me of the irish in that they are quite honest, simple and catholic).  in any event, my point still stands.  if you want to truly arrest fascism in its tracks, then you take on the frame of mind of a scientist, not a social justice advocate:  you look at how many immigrants are coming and ask yourself how much is too much before the white majority loses its shit and starts throwing bricks through windows.  Those are your options.  Lecturing an indigenous white englishman on racism because he doesn't want to see his historical home transformed by mass immigration won't work.  you have to slow the pace of immigration in order to slow the pace of fascism.  That is the only option.",

People of whiteness will only resort to fascism when they feel they are being punished, so as I said, its not so much the end goal which is troubling.

I guess it makes you feel good.  but its not working on me because I have the high ground.  I believe it is immoral to erase a nation.  I really do believe that.  I consider it a form of genocide.  So here we are:  to you, I am a racist because I believe in nations.  To me, you are a racist because you do not believe in nations.  It is really that simple.  Either you start talking turkey and learn to debate people or you don't, and hide behind the 'racist' slur like a cock-roach running from the sunlight.  The more and more people like you hide behind the 'racist' word, the more and more people like the English Defense League grows...and u still don't see the connection.  No, people like you are not truly moral.  You are a shit-disturber.  When the native white English starting hanging people like you from lamp-posts, don't say you were not warned.",

I think you are flattering yourself because it flatters our egos whenever we tell ourselves we are not racists.  The truth is we need to understand how someone like hitler can rise to power, and by reducing it all to simply \"racism\", we learn nothing about ourselves or our common humanity.  Diverse populations have historically come into conflict.  This is why immigration has always been a sensitive subject.  It has to be taken seriously.  People can die over this issue.  It is literally a matter of life and death.  But I've decided you are not genuine with regards to immigration.  I think you are a millenial, an idealist, and quite young.  But you lost, and now you're hurting.  I'm sorry about that.  But one day when you are much older you will look around, and you will be grateful to be living in a sovereign country.

I'll repeat the question just to drive it home.  He said,\n\n\"why exacerbate a problem of unemployment and social tensions on the grounds that \"we can't discriminate against the bad people coming here when we have bad people here already\"? Why would you willingly vote for foreigners who are either uneducated or intolerant of our culture to be able to come here and either scrounge off our benefits system or further the already troublesome social divide ripping parts of our towns & cities apart?\"\n\nThese are serious questions, and you will have to answer them if you want to make the changes you seek.  But u won't answer them, will you?  No, you will run away.  Run away, little boy, run away.....",

I'm glad we are doing this, as it is an object lesson for any who pass by these comments.  since yesterday, you have evaded all inquiries and all questions posed to you.  do you seriously believe you can further your objectives this way?  Simply calling people 'racist' is not an argument.  Those people in Manchester are British citizens, so they can go anywhere they like in the UK.  Nevertheless, you raise an important issue.  What if the UK does balkanize along those lines?  It isn't impossible;  there are historical precedents for that.  Are you familiar with the term, \"balkanization\"?  If not, look it up.  Croats and Serbs of the former Yugoslavia decided they could not live together.  Were they \"racists\"?  Well, in a way, yes.  But who cares?  They slaughtered each other and now live separately...in separate countries.  Just like the Northern Irish, just like the Scots, just like the Czechs and the Slovaks, and maybe one day the Catalonians.  Are they all \"racists\"?  Perhaps they are.  It does not matter.  They split up and went their separate ways.  Now, here are your options:  you can confront this brutal truth or you can run away.  Its up to you.  Just know that running away will only make it harder for you to win the argument.",

How would any of them get on if they lived in a black country and at a company where they are the only white person working there. I think many immigrants are Hero`s. And this is not just about Islamic Immigrants Thats just an excuse. Brexiteers want all immigrants out who will be in competition for work and money. \n\nMy comment about an Australian Abo wanting all White immigrants out of his country just like white`s want all immigrants out of the UK. At some point the white racist will come to the conclusion to ignore that argument completely and negate and not give a fcuk about the fact that many Australian Blacks would dream of having their country back. This would also be justified somehow in the mind of the racist. But there is a saying which is what goes around comes around. And being around many very wealthy people in the UK most of whom are white, it makes me think karma has some truth to it seeing as most of them have everything yet are depressed.",
