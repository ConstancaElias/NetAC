Years and years and years of the NHS being destroyed.\u2019', 'Johnson was visiting Whipps Cross University Hospital in north-east London when he was challenged by the parent on a children\u2019s ward.', 'The nature of the young girl\u2019s condition was not clear from the exchange.', 'The dad said \u2018A&E guys were great\u2019 but that followed a two hour wait on another ward for treatment.', 'He said: \u2018This ward is not safe for children. There was one registrar covering the entirety of this ward and the neonatal unit.\u2019', 'A spokesman for the Prime Minister said Mr Johnson was visiting public services to see for himself the reality of the situation.', 'The spokesman said the man was understandably \u2018very distressed\u2019.', 'He said the PM was \u2018not going to hide away from those circumstances when he goes on these visits, and so obviously is keen to talk to people and empathise and see what he can do to help\u2019.', 'He added: \u2018It\u2019s also a reminder of why exactly he is so keen to make the NHS a priority and make sure it\u2019s getting the funding that it requires\u2019.', 'Responding to Omar Salem\u2019s claim there were not enough doctors and nurses on a children\u2019s ward, Alan Gurney, chief executive of Whipps Cross hospital, said: \u2018We are constantly reviewing staffing levels on our wards to ensure our patients are safe at all times, but occasionally \u2013 as in fact happened on this ward last night- an unexpected emergency in one part of the hospital can cause a temporary pressure elsewhere.\u2019",

The fact is the NHS is understaffed and overworked. Whether we know or fully understand the beauracratic processes in place another. People want someone to talk to and blame and Boris is the current PM. The tories have been trying to Privatise the NHS for sometime, and although parts seem fine with charging and I agree that there are too many people now demanding services, there are cuts there are charges incurred to the NHS that they can't afford, there is understaffing and we are relient on workers from abroad as we have less and less people in the UK chosing it as a career. It's also over managed, way too much paper work and less on floor teams and Matrons looking after wards. I'm not saying Boris is bad or good, |'m saying we need to do alot more for our services NHS included, it's easy to diss it but when it's gone we won't all be able to pay for the costs of often lifesaving or changing care, and if <b> Brexit </b>really does mean a larger disparity between rich and poor, a higher mortality rate and rather a grim outlook",

It is very simple (maybe you are too), if you are part of a party then you share its aims and policies, but you also take (big word coming here, take your time and sound it out) responsibility for its actions. In this case, the actions of the tories have been to consitently cut funding for the NHS and involve private concerns who are more motivated by short term profit than quality of care.",

The Tories claimed getting Google to pay 3% tax was a win when they are supposed to pay between 20 and 30% tax. They've given huge tenders to private conpanies over NHS bids despite using the same equipment and NHS staff training the private company's staff. <b> Brexit </b>will make this worse too.

The NHS staff that were using the scanner had to train the private company's staff how to use it. Can you explain to me why they would go for a bid that cost 7million more, using the same equipment and NHS trained staff? It's not even that unusual. They are giving bit by bit to the private sector every day and it's not always cheaper. They are killing it to justify 100% privatisation. I work alongside NHS staff and am based in an NHS building.
