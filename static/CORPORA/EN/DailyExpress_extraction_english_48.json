        "postText": "'The heated debate was sparked by a new website launched in April by Nevena Bridgen, wife of Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, called Wives of Westminster. Leftie journalist Afua Hirsch criticised the initiative claiming the group of wives and girlfriends of Tory MPs participating showed nothing more than to be  out of touch. Ms Hirsch argued it echoed Tory contenders to the party leadership once Prime Minister Theresa May will step down  parading their wives around as a key part of their campaign strategy in reference to a recent interview with Dominic Raab and his wife.She added the whole situation felt like we're back in the 1950s.', ' In response to her claim, former Conservative candidate Michelle Dewberry pointed out the extraordinary progress made by women in politics highlighting all the women in high positions from Theresa May to Nicola Sturgeon to Penny Mordaunt. ', 'But Ms Hirsch insisted: I don\u2019 t think that the way you encourage women is by denying that the problems exist. ', ' I think you\u2019 ve got to be honest about the problems. ', ' And it\u2019 s because of the fact that we do have women in positions of power that it\u2019 s all the more shocking to me that these cultural attitudes towards the role of wives still exist. ', ' The response left Nick Ferrari with his head in his hands and infuriated LBC radio presenter Maajid Nawaz. ', ' Mr Nawaz said: Oh, for goodness sake.Just before we began I said to you nice dress and you said thank you, it\u2019 s a suit, catching the attention of everyone because you posted it on Instagram and you post the name of the designer every single time. ', ' Are you now drawing the attention to your clothes when you do that ? ', ' The point is, they\u2019 re proud to support the shopping thing that they just put up and it\u2019 s their choice. ', ' And I agree with everything Michelle said.It\u2019 s like me, who stood as a Lib Dem candidate, complaining about racism in the Tories when they\u2019 ve got a British - Pakistani Home Secretary.', 'The Lib Dems have never done that.Labour have never produced a female Prime Minister. ', 'I\u2019 m not a Tory but I can recognise\u2026 hold on!Let me rant!', 'I can recognise that the Conservatives have put forward two female Prime Ministers. ', 'At the end of the day, we\u2019 ve got to stop searching for things to complain about.', 'In a welcoming message put up on the website, Ms Bridgen said it was set up to\u201c discuss the challenges and topics we are all experiencing as women, wives, mothers and working women of Britain.', ' She added: The Wives of Westminster take a kind - spirited, open - minded, feel - good, nourishing inside and out, purpose - centric approach to a meaningful life. ', ' Our themes revolve around the lifestyle of the Wives of Westminster: women empowerment, modern family, careers, wellness, purpose, kid - friendly lifestyle.'",
