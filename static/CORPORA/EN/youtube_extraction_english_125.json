We posed that question to millennials in this social experiment and asked them to show us what 'old' looks like. Then we introduced them to some real 'old' people. Watch what happens when folks let go of their outdated beliefs and embrace the idea that aging is not about decline - it's about growth.

You know people there don't even do anything right, even their job, unless you sue them to do it. Not  a very cooperative, in fact rather polarized, society, and very obnoxiously<b>  ageist</b>.

You have so many things wrong with you, buy our products or services. It is unfortunate that aging is not honored in the U.S. That aging is seen as shameful and stricken with illness and disease. That young people do not realize their life can end at<b>  age</b> 18, 26 or 30. Being older does not mean sickness or death or looking ugly.

On the one hand, I think it's great to show that <b> age </b>doesn't necessarily limit people on what they can do physically. But there are a slew of us in our 50s and older (and younger, too) who deal with chronic illnesses and/or disability that precludes us being able to dance or do martial arts, or maybe even just walk around the block. Still, we are not <b> \"old</b>\" in the sense most people think of. We still have sharp minds, we can still have a rich inner life, we can still engage with and enjoy friends, be creative, continue to grow in so many ways, ways that do not require physical prowess or strength. It's the GROWTH that matters. As long as we keep growing inwardly, we are still \"young\". (Not that we need to define it with that term.) We are still VITAL. I think that's the best word for it. You don't get<b>  \"ol</b>d\" in the negative sense until you lose your ability to choose life.",

However, this may be due to you not taking care of your health, not having enough fun, or taking on too much stress. I've met 60 year olds who look like they're in their 40s because they took care of themselves and avoid stress. This is why I no longer think anyone under<b>  65 </b>is old because you are still very functional and can still look young if you take care of yourself. I don't think you start <b> gett</b>ing old until you near 70, when you no longer have the energy to do as you please and your body starts deteriorating. However, I think even as you near 65, you shouldn't let this get to you and start to affect the perceptions you have of yourself. I think you should still be yourself, even if other people see<b>  you</b> as \"old\" lol. Since I once considered myse<b> lf t</b>o be \"o<b> ld\" </b>at the age I am now when I was younger, i'm sure other people younger than me may conside<b> r me</b> to be \"old\" too. Yet this obviously doesn't affect me and my personality. I'll always be myself, no matter if i'm in my 20s or 50s or 70s. Forever young!",

Us of the flower power generation of beautiful people were very intolerant of <b> age.</b> A slogan of the time was \"never trust anyone over 25\". In the early 1970's I remember reading about a young couple of 25 years, part of the 1960's California surfer scene, who killed themselves on reaching 25 because they thought meaningful life was effectively over by then. It isn't, every<b>  age</b> has it's good points. So good luck, millennial generation, your time is now, enjoy it while you've got it 'cos it won't last forever.",

The <b> elderly </b>couple there (about 80) went walking everyday and did yoga everyday, too. They still held yoga classes and we're much more flexible than me. Also, their mind was young, too.  But as for my grand parents, they are 70 and it is completely different. My grand ma smoked all her live heavily and well, it shows itself. My granddad grew bitter and lives in his own world where everything is like it was 50 years ago. I'm not saying they are bad people. But they arent acitve. They just live by each day and it is all the same. So really, its individual",

Trump is 70 and for over a year has been traveling across the US almost everyday doing two or three massive rallies with TV interviews in between.  Watching the two of them you see Trump upbeat, calm, and fresh as a daisy (he'd just come from one rally, stopped by DC for two hours to open his hotel, then going on to NC afterward for another rally).  Poor Dana Bash looked tired, drawn, haggard and stressed.  Bet she wishes she was assigned to  Hillary who does maybe one rally a week and then sleeps for days!",

After seeing over the last couple of years, Ms. Ernestine and Dr. Josephina Monesterio go viral, I've wondered how many of us like-minded ladies are out there. I'm Dee and @ 60 I am also an active NPC  fitness/figure/physique competitor since 1979. Originally Seattle born and raised... I grew up with the Emerald Cup through the 80's.  I recently joined AARP and I am just now coming upon this little piece and I love it!!!  Over the last couple of years I've been getting subtle messages... some not so subtle that  us babyboomer aged individuals are not marketable. I am happy to see this changing. They say that 60 is the  new 40....:)  I hope you were able to achieve your goal last year....best of luck to you for the coming years.",

Which is pretty good, and 20 years younger than I really am. I guess people see others in a different perspective, because that's about a 30 year<b>  age</b> gap !. I feel great, and I'm more active now then when I was in my 20's !! When I look into the mirror, I see a young middle aged person, and I'm proud of who I am, and how well I've taken care of myself.

The person inside isn't who you see on the outside. You'll better understand this as you make your way through your life and see for yourself that who you are inside doesn't always match the image in the mirror. You may find yourself wanting to do more, learn more, experience more, love more... because with each day you have less time and need to grab every moment that you can. And to the millennial-bashers, please keep in mind that we were them once, too. They're young, they're still learning many lessons and trying to make their way in the world. Instead of ripping on them, why not inspire, uplift, help and cheer them on? At the end of the day, they are walking the same path that we've left many years ago. I wish you all well, and may your insides never match your outsides. Stay beautiful.",

People over 45 are not invisible and are some of the best teachers you will ever have in your lives! This also goes for employers in the workforce that seem to think they only need young blood in the building. Companies that hire all ages will be around the longest because they get it! This includes all these new millennial businesses as well. It's not all about 18-35...Why not learn from people who have walked the walk of life? Yes, I'm<b>  old</b> but I still have a lot to learn and have many experiences to teach others. It's not easy being a talk show host on YouTube with the young viewership freely making their opinionated comments, but I still persevere because I want to help others avoid making some of the life choices and mistakes that I did.  Cheers to 50+!! Dear Sybersue xo",

I wrote an article about Millennials (first given name Echo-boomers) vs Baby boomer because these kids are in a much different world than the boomers were.  The tragic employment issue, no insurance benies, soon no SS, high college bills, low pay scales, competition from foreign workers and the result is poor loyalty, poor work ethic and a revolving door, They are trying to figure out where they belong. The older generation needs to teach and the Mills need the desire to learn from all they can! We're all in this together!",

How they handled the experience, what they learned from the experience and most of all how fast they are able to move on to the next challenge and experience. I learned from individuals older than me. The bottom line is we are all different in one way or the other and from that we can learn so much from each other. The true beauty of life.",

There are many people, including myself, whose physical abilities are hampered by disease or other chronic illness, so we might not have the physical stamina of someone 10 or 15 years older than us. And, there are plenty of people who can't do pushups or jumping jacks or dance like Donald O'Connor, or run the NY maratho<b> n at</b> age 25. Why do we even have to characte<b> rize</b> \"old\" in terms of ability or non-ability to engage in physical endeavors?

Once you enter your 30's you are forgotten about. Technology is also the problem and how it is marketed, do you see older people in a smart phone commercial? No, everyone is in their 20's or even younger. I never really cared about<b>  age</b>, it is definitely how you feel and one thing I have noticed is that I have never stopped learning. I am more curious about everything than when I was in my 20's.",
