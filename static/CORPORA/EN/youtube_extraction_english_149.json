I'm primarily attracted to younger guys around 18-22 or so and always have been (when I was younger and they were older than me, those were also the ages I liked), but I've begun misrepresenting my<b>  age</b> on dating sites lately because people have used m<b> y ag</b>e as a reason not to talk to me. I don't always use such apps for dating either, I'm also looking for friends, and I like to talk about my various interests such as writing, languages, electronic music, and learning about other cultures and perspectives. \n\nI also think it's vitally important that younger people have older friends and vice versa, especially in t<b> he <b> g</b</b>>ay community, where we sometimes still face a lot of prejudice depending on where you live or what your situation is. We ALL need that kind of support and to come together as equals, regardless of petty little differences <b> like</b> age. We can't afford to exclude one another, in the same way society over the years has excluded us and other people who were different or didn't fit into their box. \n\nThat doesn't mean you can't have standards or be attracted to the kind of people you are. But at least keep an open mind about friendships and realize that not everyone is out to creep on you or hurt you, and many just want to protect you. \n\nAs another side of this too however, I just want to point out that some yo<b> ung<b> e</b</b>>r gay men are attracted to older and vice versa as well, and neither party should be ashamed of that. If both parties are consenting and within the boundaries of the law, <b> there's </b>nothing wrong with it and fuck what anyone says.",

I watch a lot of \"coming out\" videos, primarily because a young <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>guy I knew very well, killed himself after being rejected by his family. I don't ever want to see or hear of that happening again and I pledged after coming home from his funeral that I would do anything in my power to prevent it from happening again. Yes I do get the usual brainless comments now and the from those I'd hope would know better. But the end goal is all that concerns me. if I can help in any small way to stop even one person from taking their life,  I'll happily take all the abuse in the world. Thanks so much for showing what a fine young man you are. x",

If some of your young viewers comment here about their feelings in what sounds discriminatory towards us it might be helpful for them to not just understand that if they're lucky they too will become members of an aged population but that it would be measurably beneficial for our society as a whole if they were to visit a <b> senior </b>care facility and take note of what really happens as one ages. It's a sad truth that as you live your life having a large social circle in your teens and through to what some may refer to as middle life, that change is in the wind. As each decade there after passes you eventually lose contact with so many that once you knew and even considered to be your \"friends\" through natural attrition which obviously includes the fate of mortality. Thanks for understanding how one such as myself that has one maybe two and on a stretch three friends at this stage of my life (I'm 59) that at times when I'm alone and search for what is currently happening I find this medium of YouTube to be quite inspirational. Comments made such as this one by myself are for me a way of having a chance to speak freely and hopefully have a virtual connection with others even if I never receive a \"Like\" ...it, YouTube is an outlet, a way of connecting of understanding and of revisiting our own youthful past.  Best wishes to all....",
