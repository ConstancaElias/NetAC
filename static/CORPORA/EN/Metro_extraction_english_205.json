        "postText": "For too long \u2018nude\u2019 has meant a light beige.', 'When one black man found a plaster that matched his skin colour, he was over the moon.', 'Dominique Apollon, a doctoral researcher from Stanford University, said it took him his whole lifetime but he finally found an inconspicuous band-aid.', 'The vice president of research at nonprofit Race Forward from Oakland, California, wrote on Twitter how delighted he was at the discovery.', 'Though it was such a minor thing, he was almost on the verge of tears, he said.', 'The sweet moment has amassed over 500,000 likes and shares on Twitter, showing people how important it is for society to cater to all people.', '\u2018It\u2019s taken me 45 trips around the sun, but for the first time in my life, I know what it feels like to have a \u2018band-aid\u2019 in my own skin tone,\u2019 he wrote.', '\u2018You can barely even spot it in the first image. For real I\u2019m holding back tears.', '\u2018This felt like belonging. Like feeling valued. Sadness for my younger self and millions of kids of colour, esp black kids.', '\u2018Like a reminder of countless spaces where my skin is still not welcomed. Feared. Hated. Like \u201cwhy am I really thinking all this about an effing band-aid?\u201d\u2018', 'He revealed that the particular type of plaster he was using was from TruColor, which offers products in many different tones.', 'The small discovery led to a lot of people\u2019s realisation that they can go most days without thinking about race.', 'Others said plasters gave them the first memory of experiencing race as they came to know their skin was different from others.', 'Dominique ended the thread with a positive message.', '\u2018I\u2019m glad this thread has sparked some love, introspection, empathy, and conscious actions in others.', '\u2018White supremacy is a beast, and defeating it will take all of the above elements and more, applied at all levels of our societies. But the results will be so, so beautiful.\u2019', 'Dominique isn\u2019t the first person to draw light to the narrow and exclusionary definitions of the words \u2018nude\u2019 and \u2018skin tone\u2019.', 'For so many products, nondescript beige designed to suit white people is the default.', 'Back in 2017 a shoe brand was praised for releasing a \u2018nude\u2019 collection in different skin tones, while in 2015 a student successfully petitioned to give \u2018nude\u2019 a more inclusive dictionary definition.', 'These things might seem small \u2013 a plaster, some shoes, a lipstick \u2013 but they form a part of our culture, and declare to the world who products are aimed to please.",

I am mixed <b> race </b>and I am actually bothered about things that affect me because of my skin colour, not a mis-matched plaster that I will wear for a few hours before throwing it away. Do people actually shop for plasters to match their skin tone? Don't most just go to the nearest chemist, find the cheapest brand and purchase? I have never in my 32 years on this earth had anyone laugh or stare because I have a plaster on that's a different colour than my skin. Normal plasters don't match white skin either so I'm really not sure why this guy is getting so emotional and holding back tears??I could understand if it was a prosthetic limb that you had to wear or finding make up that matched your exact skin tone but it's a plaster. I can't imagine anyone other than a bitchy high school teenage girl from a 90's movie that would make fun of someone because they were wearing a plaster.",
