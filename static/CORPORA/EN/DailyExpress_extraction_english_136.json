        "postText": "'Rachel Riley uploaded a picture of herself on Wednesday wearing a white T-shirt which featured a photoshopped image of Jeremy Corbyn carrying a placard which read: Jeremy Corbyn is a racist endeavour. The original photo of the Labour leader was one of him taken in 1984 when he was arrested while protesting against the South African apartheid.', 'The real message on his placard read: Defend the right to protest against apartheid. Join this picket, but this was changed on Rachel\u2019s top.', 'She shared a photo of herself wearing the number on her Twitter account, @RachelRileyRR, to her 656,600 followers.', 'I didn\u2019t feel comfortable knowing my workplace was to be full of racists tonight, she captioned it.', 'I don\u2019t endorse Boris, but I do endorse #NeverCorbyn. Please see my pinned thread if you still don\u2019t understand why. #LeadersDebate #LabourAntisemitism.', 'Following posting a picture, Rachel has faced an onslaught of backlash, with some Twitter users calling her to be sacked from Countdown.', 'One person wrote: Channel 4 I am disgusted that you have an employee of yours - Rachel Riley - stamping all over the history of protest for black rights in this country. She skewed an image of Jeremy Corbyn protesting for an end to apartheid and replaced it with her own message that he\u2019s racist.', 'Another said: Yep @Channel4 definitely needs to sack Rachel Riley #sackRachelRiley #sackRachelRiley #sackRachelRiley.', 'A third wrote: Disgraceful from Rachel Riley, she should be sacked with immediate effect!! Should be held accountable for her slander.', 'Rachel, who is due to give birth in the next few weeks to her first child with husband Pasha Kovalev, defended her T-shirt on Twitter.', 'She wrote yesterday morning: Without feeding individual ignorant trolls, this is why I have no qualms using this photo to highlight Corbyn\u2019s racism.', 'Rachel then uploaded articles about Nelson Mandela declining to meet Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s anti-apartheid movement.', 'In a follow-up tweet, the Countdown star said: Why would Nelson Mandela be advised by actual anti-apartheid heroes not to meet Corbyn and his extremist group if they were so fantastic?', 'Because that\u2019s more leftist revisionism. Along with inviting the IRA and friends from Hamas for tea in parliament somehow helps people.', 'She went on to say: People can shout all they like. Most are ignorant of the facts. Which they still won\u2019t read when they\u2019re laid out in black and white.', 'Rachel shared another few articles about Mandela refusing to meet Corbyn, who was part of the City of London Anti-Apartheid Group (CLAAG) during the eighties, with the group also connected to South African communist and ANC activist David Kitson.', 'The mum-to-be went on to add on Twitter: Trying to brand me as racist for this, whist lauding themselves as anti-racist heroes, shows just how little regard many people have for anti-Jewish racism, and why I and many others speak so loudly.', 'It\u2019s a hatred which unites the far right, far left and is having a resurgence.', 'She also shared a picture about not feeding the trolls, a campaign she has been involved in.', 'I won\u2019t dignify this with any further response & I won\u2019t tolerate abuse from those who choose to rank one form of racism over another, that\u2019s hypocrisy, she stated alongside a picture of the four steps.', 'They\u2019re all unacceptable. End of. If this is what it takes to highlight the nastiness of these people then fine. This today.', 'Rachel regularly battles with trolls on Twitter as she heavily criticises the Labour party and its alleged anti-Semitism within the party on a daily basis.', 'Jeremy Corbyn has strongly denied allegations of anti-Semitism during the controversy that has ripped through his party.', 'At the beginning of this year, Rachel revealed she had been given extra security during filming of the Channel 4 show', 'She explained the online abuse towards her and turned into physical threats.', 'She told The Times newspaper: The more I speak, the more abuse I get, and the more abuse I get, the more I speak.', ' It's got to the point where I can't look at my Twitter feed any more ... it's just a constant stream.', 'Rachel, who is Jewish, revealed it\u2019 s even affecting her job and will have added protection on the set of Countdown.', 'She added: We are getting more security for Countdown.'",
