        "postText": "Australia\u2019s prime minister has been ridiculed after he embarrassingly mistook an Asian voter for being Chinese on the first day of his campaign trail.', 'Scott Morrison took to the streets of Sydney on Saturday to start winning over some of the electorate ahead of parliamentary elections on May 18.', 'But his campaign launch was soon mired by an embarrassing clip of him addressing a Korean woman\u2026 in Chinese.', 'The clip of Liberal Party leader Morrison shows him interacting with voters in the city\u2019s multicultural Strathfield suburb when he stops to salute an Asian woman.', 'The PM can be seen smiling as he shook hands with her while circled by journalists.', 'He can heard asking: \u2018Hello, how are you? Ni hao, how are you?\u2019', 'But far from being impressed at the PM\u2019s language skills, the woman responds saying: \u2018No, no, no, I\u2019m Korean\u2019.', 'The PM, who has been in office since last year, listens to the woman\u2019s reply before moving on from his gaffe to meet other public members.', 'The embarrassing scene coincidentally happened just moments after he visited a Korean restaurant in Strathfield, which has sizeable Chinese and Korean migrant populations.', 'It caused swift public reaction, with many Twitter users taking to the platform to slam the PM\u2019s \u2018racist\u2019 slip.', 'One wrote: \u2018Strathfield has a high population of Koreans. To assume they are Chinese is racist and quite stupid.\u2019', 'This was echoed by another Tweeter who said: \u2018Scott Morrison accuses Labour of peddling racism.', '\u2018Then shouts \u201cNi hao\u201d to the first Asian person he greets. Turns out she\u2019s Korean. Grass root racism on display for all.\u2019', 'While one Asian-Australian simply cared to point out that greeting fellow Asians with \u2018\u201dNi hao\u201d, even when I know they speak Mandarin. It\u2019s not a thing we do.\u2019",
