        "postText": " Here are some of the most common sexist tropes that women face when running for office. Subscribe to NowThis: http://go.nowth.is/News_Subscribe. This is what gender bias in media looks like on the 2020 campaign trail and what to do about it. Jess McIntosh, Democratic strategist, Co-host Signal Boost: 'What we're looking at is a gigantic field of Democratic candidates. .... We've never seen a field before where we had multiple women running against ... multiple men. When we see the same thing happening to all of the women that doesn't happen to any of the men it becomes much much easier to say I think there's a gender dynamic at play here. We should take this incredibly important learning moment and use it to understand that we do not apply the same lens to men and women yet.  Likable. Authentic. Electable. These are buzzwords that I want red flags to be going off in your head every time you see them.' Morning Joe:  He's such a nice, likable guy, at least for all the people I know that know Joe Biden and how we feel about him Anchor: I think Bernie Sanders did great. He was believable. He was likable. Jess: When Kirsten Gillibrand announced, the very first question that she got asked was are you too likable. When Elizabeth Warren announced, the first question that she got asked was are you likable enough. They're creating a sexism defense because they can't accept the fact that some the women that are running as Democrats are unlikable people. The truth is all of these women are top tier candidates. Millions of people like them. .... That conversation should be over. The next one I want to point out is authenticity. It's a good thing right? It's somebody being true to themselves. Beto is such an authentic candidate. Bernie. Totally authentic candidate. Women aren't allowed to be as vulnerable as men are.  Pete Buttigieg has the staying power because he's an outsider, he's governed as a mayor in a small town in Indiana, he has a different message and he's authentic where as other candidates like Kirsten Gillibrand and Elizabeth Warren are trying much too hard to try and impress voters. Fox News anchor: Warren is getting mocked for awkwardly cracking open a beer while livestreaming.  Fox News anchor: She would have gotten my vote if she shotgunned it. \u2026 She has a problem not being herself. It's obvious she's inauthentic. Fox News anchor: And Beto was doing the livestream thing too. Cooking in the kitchen, she's trying to rip that off. Jess: Electability is the last one that just has to die. We subjectively decide that somebody is electable because they look like people who have been elected before.' Anchor: One of Biden's biggest selling points is what experts and political observers call his electability, that he may stand the best chance at beating Donald Trump. Anchor: I would put Beto and Pete Buttigieg and Biden in a lane of electability but also some progressive creds.  Jess: Joe Biden has actually run for president several times and not been elected. But we're used to seeing a candidate that looks like him and saying that's somebody who could be president. The only electability that matters is what happens in the polls on Election Day. Sen. Kamala Harris, she is walking an even tighter tightrope than the rest of the women. She's a woman of color. She's a Black woman running for president. Anchor: Kamala Harris is facing questions about her heritage Her mother is Indian and her father is Jamaican but she says she will always identify as a Black woman. Radio producer: What do you say to people questioning the legitimacy of your Blackness Samantha Bee: Dammit Kamala, why can't you just be one thing so your enemies know what to hate you for? Jess: She is in every conversation that you're having on social media with any with any of your friends or family. But the coverage simply isn't there. It's just not the same. Let's follow her around the clock and see what she feels and thinks on any on any given issue of the day In the same way that it is with a Beto \u2014 #Media #Sexism #2020 #2020Election Connect with NowThis: Like us on Facebook: http://go.nowth.is/News_Facebook.

If the National Democratic Party faced the facts, and realized that being for illegal aliens, giving them entitlements and mass immigration was not in the best interest of the country they'd come back to us blue dogs, boll weevils and conservative Democrats and put us in charge of the party",

Beto has done shady things regarding his campaign and hiding his donations and being involved with shady bundlers. You can't elect based on looks and yes I agree however, think about a candidate for what they can do for a country not because you think minorities should win cuz they never have. I don't like how no one is talking about Andrew yang when I think he's such a great candidate so please anybody look him up",

Now Warren is gaining on Bernie, but the rubber starts to hit the road at the first debate. I think Gabbard will rise once the American people see how sharp and good on her feet she is, not to mention likable and authentic.  ; )",

'Like able' IS a quality for ANY election, the president of paper clips should be likable. If you think that the media should pander to women in this blood thirsty sport then go to bed. Hilary has run twice so this 'likable' bull you need to ask yourself are you looking for<b>  sexism</b>? Because one can ALWAYS find what they're looking for, always. P.S. what's 'likable' in men is different in what's likable in women. Maybe that's what you have a problem with BUT that's <b> a WOMA</b>N thing. FOR EXAMPLE, every time a female celebrity has the first child all they talk about in interviews is being a mother because that's what's 'likable' to women. Male actors have a new baby they announce it and move on to their craft as a subject. Because that's what's likable to men, work. Mayor Pete served in the Military likable for men, women could careless. AOC is then and pretty and the media (and women) treat her like she's the Kardashian of political, likable to women. Meanwhile, these women couldn't pick Nancy Pelosi out of a line up. AOC is even in on the front of tabloids.",

CNN or MSNBC fans will conversely feel very reinforced in their beliefs. \n\nA second opinion that goes against NYT, WAPO, HUFFPO, CNN, MSNBC, CBS, <b> ABC,</b> Vox, Vice, Politico, PBS, every latenight host, all Google recommended stories and YouTube curated search results will seem insignificant and like tinfoil hat lunacy.\n\nPeople on the left don't even know that Tucker is regularly disagreeing with Trump and dropping truth bombs. Everyone on the right is well acquainted with the Don Lemons and Rachel Maddows...\n\nIn a very roundabout way, what I'm saying is that if you have two sources as a right leaning individual, you're about 1,000,000% more likely to have something resembling a full picture than if you are someone who mainly watches left leaning media.",
