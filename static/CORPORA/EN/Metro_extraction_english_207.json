Of all the countries that I have visited and know about the USA is one of the most ignorant and, yet, the most arrogant and self congratulating.  Please look at your own society before criticising others - Come out of the 18th century and join the modern world.  Yes, I have lived in the USA and have visited (not by choice) and have relatives there - I do know what I am talking about.",

When Blair came into power immigration as a whole multiplied 10 fold, rising from 50k to 500k annually. It's not just a problem in the UK but happening worldwide. Perhaps instead of throwing simple minded insults and doing some research you'll understand why. This isnt by accident, immigration isnt an accident either but for people that are too lazy to understand, its quicker and simpler to call people racists and bigots.",
