        "postText": "A man has successfully sued beer company Brewdog after a barman at one of its chains refused him a drink because it was marketed at \u2018girls\u2019.', 'Thomas Bower, 27, sued for sex discrimination after he was told he could not buy a Pink IPA at a bar in Cardiff, Wales, because he was a man.', 'The beer, sold for \u00a34, was launched in 2018 to highlight the gender pay gap and gave people who identified as female the chance to buy the drink at a discounted cost.', 'It was satirically dubbed Beer for Girls, with BrewDog saying it had created Pink IPA as a way of \u2018exposing the sexist marketing techniques used to target women, particularly within the beer industry\u2019.', 'Dr Bower, from Cardiff, said he was told that as he was male, he could not order the drink and he was instead offered the company\u2019s Punk IPA for \u00a35.', 'The software engineer said: \u2018After a bit of a back and forth with me protesting this, I felt forced to identify as female and was then able to get the drink for \u00a34 \u2013 I complained to the company about this and they said it wasn\u2019t discrimination because the price difference was part of a national campaign to raise awareness about the gender pay gap.', '\u2018Not satisfied with this, I complained again to Brewdog stating that I was intending to take them to court over this but would rather resolve the problem outside court. They ignored this.\u2019', 'He took Brewdog to the small claims court and said he would drop his claim if they apologised publicly.', 'Court documents dated May 23, 2019, stated his claim for damages and an apology for \u2018direct discrimination and breach of the Equality Act 2010\u2019.', 'In the document Dr Bower said: \u2018[I] felt forced to lie about my sex in order to receive the product at the lower price and told the bartender that I identified as female.', '\u2018The bartender then served me the drink at a price of \u00a34.\u2019', 'District Judge Phillips said: \u2018In my judgment, it is clear that in this case the claimant has been directly discriminated against by the defendant because of his sex.', '\u2018The fact that by identifying as female he was still able to purchase a Pink IPA makes no difference.', '\u2018I accept what Dr Bower says, namely that identifying as female was the only way he could purchase a Pink IPA at a cost of \u00a34.\u2019', 'Judge Phillips awarded Dr Bower \u00a31,000 in damages after saying he would have felt \u2018humiliated\u2019.', 'The engineer, who represented himself in court, donated his damages to the Young Women\u2019s Trust, which aims to help women negotiate for better pay and male mental health charity CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably).', 'Dr Bower said he \u2018does not deny the existence\u2019 of the gender pay gap, but said there should be equal opportunities over equal outcome.', 'According to court documents, Brewdog stated the Pink IPA was created as part of a \u2018satirical campaign\u2019 to highlight gender inequality.', 'The documents, seen by WalesOnline, state: \u2018As part of this campaign, the defendant says it rebranded its product, Punk IPA and sold this as Pink IPA.', '\u2018They say the campaign was undertaken for four weeks and commenced on March 8, 2018, International Women\u2019s Day.', '\u2018They say Pink IPA was sold to those identifying as women and was offered at a reduced price of 20 per cent, on the basis of this being the gender pay gap in the United Kingdom.\u2019', 'Brewdog argued that as Dr Bower claimed he identified as female, he received no different treatment and was able to purchase the Pink IPA.",
