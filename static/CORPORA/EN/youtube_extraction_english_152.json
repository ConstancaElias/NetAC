He was great in his 100 first days as president and is going strong 2 years later, actually better than any president we've had so far.  Yes he made mistakes in the past.  We all have.  He may have said and done the wrong thing in the past, but who hasn't.   Their are people that are of such low standards such as her friends that will resort to lies and name calling like this so called journalist just to destroy and smear a person's life and credibility.

No apologies for \"<b> Pussy </b>grab\", but apologies for \"pissed off or Screw this\" , that's grotesquely comical .\nYes the BBC used to be an honest impartial and very fair institution once upon a time . Then the BBC changed ownership and now for instance has no issue when people talk trash against muslims on a regular basis on either TV or the Radio and no apologies seem needed or expected . Strangely enough when someone says Pissed off we need an apology and if anyone ever dares mentioning anything remotely negative about Israel or Jewish people , this person is fired, banned and basically buried and forgotten . The BBC was the first to be against John Galliano , but we can say anything we want against Palestine and no apology are requested . \nTony Hall, Baron of Birkenhead has become a puppet and it seems that there is a puppeteer behind the curtain . \nI don't like double standards . You can't only be<b>  old</b> people TV when it is convenient and then censor what you believe might hurt the ears of some spectators or auditors . That for me is utterly disgusting . \nMy long time friend Julia Sawalha told me a thing or two about the BBC and its unshakable principles .\nBut thanks for the answer esclad. And thanks for the video , i like Kim very much , her and Joanna Lumley are the best ladies to come out of the UK. And Julia of course.",

The only thing WE worry about, are the <b> lunatic </b>Democrats and Liberals who, literally threw their arms in the air, wailed, and \"required\" a \"safe zone\" and therapy - simply because their candidate failed. These same lunatics are still physically attacking anyone who disagrees with their demands. These outrageous lunatics destroy private citizens' personal properties - burning the innocent bystanders' cars; bashing out storefront windows; and even destroying public properties! Those of us who voted for, and continue to support, President Trump, are shocked and appalled at all the ignorant and stupid people's behavior. We did not like Obama winning twice (and for the record, I voted for that liar the first go, certainly not the second!), and yet we managed to put on our big boy/girl britches; tie-up our bootstraps; and continued to work as well as defend our country. How then is it, the wailing, abusive, destructive, uneducated nutcases are worthy of any pity? The only concern should be, \"What the hell are they thinking and doing?! No Conservatives, has physically attacked these fools - but we will defend ourselves against their continued assaults because we are dyed in the wool, GOD-fearing, Family and Country-loving US Americans. Anyone who does not respect or agree with our Constitution and Bill of Rights, is free to leave and move to a country whose government and ideologies suits their wants, needs, and expectations. Buh-bye. Oh, and by the way, Hillary is not Presidential material. She lacked the dignity, grace, and LORD knows she lacks integrity - so much so (poor loser), she refused to face her supporters, thank them for their efforts, and congratulate Trump publicly - to show support for THE President Trump...as did when she lost to Obama. Classless. And all who support her and/or Sanders are CLUELESS.",

They still have romance, passion, intelligence, success, etc.  Most of the roles for women over 40 in America are like they don't matter anymore or have lost their intelligence, sexiness and importance.  I believe recently movie makers for American movies are waking up.",

Let's all be honest, she is a horrible actress and they don't have any roles for HER...so she's blaming it on external things. I've never been treated worse because I'm a women. I've Always been treated better. Stop acting like victims! Also, I'm seriously sick of celebrities getting involved in politics. It's really hard to continue watching them after they express they views. Just keep those things to yourself and do your job. It's liberal overload. Barf",
