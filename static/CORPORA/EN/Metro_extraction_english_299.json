I pointed out that I was not only a gay woman but also post-op male-to-female trans. The reply was \u2018Well, best to be sure\u2019.\u2019', 'Another person said: \u2018I was scheduled for a small bit of surgery and was asked to give a pregnancy test. I pointed out that I was not only a gay woman but also post-op male-to-female trans. The reply was \u2018Well, best to be sure\u2019.', 'The review was the first of its kind and drew on 26 different studies.', 'Professor Meads said her findings suggests a message of diversity is not filtering down to frontline staff.', 'She said: \u2018Many healthcare staff do not feel they need to know about their patients\u2019 sexuality. However, our research uncovered a worrying lack of knowledge of the issues, unfairness, negativity, and blatant discrimination.', '\u2018These studies found significant barriers to sexual minority women, highlighting the need for explicit and consistent education for healthcare professionals on the issues facing these women.\u2019",
