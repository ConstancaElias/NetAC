But my mom\u00a0likes my<b>  guinea</b> pig and she sometimes smells it, but it never really bothers her.\n\nAnd then my mom hates farm smells, but I go horseback riding a lot and my\u00a0dad grew up on one, so we never smell that either.\u00a0Both my dad and I, have come to the point where we don't smell manure and dirt or whatever, so it never bothers us.

It's like how you don't feel your clothing on your body after a time, unless I remind you that you're wearing clothing. Or how white noise eventually fades into the background. Neurons get bored of sending messages and stop if <b> nothing </b>new or interesting happens. Your eyes would do this except that they take part in microsaccades, a slight unnoticeable movement of the eye, which keeps the neurons in the eyes constantly functioning. If you didn't have these and attempted to focus on an object, everything in the world not in motion would disappear.\n\nThe interesting part is the study about people habituating more slowly if they thought it was toxic than if they thought it was natural. This adds to the current literature on sensory habituation.",

The ad hominem fallacy is an easy choice for these people because, since they can't counter their argument, they try to invalidate it by making the opponent less credible (which it rarely ever does).\n\nNow, since I proved that the first chunk of your comment is irrelevant, the only thing left your comment says is \"Laci is awesome\". Fine, that kinda works, but it's still irrelevant because you provided no evidence or reason why she is or why you think she is awesome.\n\nTherefore, your entire comment can be deemed 'pointless'. It add<b> s nothin</b>g to the conversation here (hell, it even insults a participant here), so it might as well not have been there in the first place hogging up space.\n\nTl;dr: Your comment is pointless.",

It's something I kept in mind while writing my comment. The thing is, the fact that the debate is purely subjective does not exempt the invalidity of personal attacks because even ugly, weak, stupid people can find people cool or pretty and have an equal contribution to the discussion. I'm sure you already know that, though.\n\nI was never truly involved in this discussion, but that necro-reply brought this thread back into my attention. It was a negative, pointless comment, so, even though I took no side on how I feel about anybody, I wanted to make it clear that a stupid comment was stupid.",

After a whole day of that I would take off my glasses and see their negative imprint for about half an hour. Wearing my glasses during that time normalized my visual field, making them invisible again.\nAn even easier example is dirt: glasses are always dirty somewhere, but even if they are covered in dried sweat droplets and dust you can see through them perfectly fine, without anything blocking your vision. it just takes a bit for your brain to adapt to them.",

Taking your glasses example, it is the difference between your eyes being able to see your glasses on command and your nose not being able to smell the odor of the room you are in on command.",

Notice how I didn't say the OP was wrong, but our noses and eyes, along with most every other feature evolved in tandem. The noses of almost any animals evolved to not be a constant in their field of vision. Granted once humans got to where they were, natural selection wasn't as strong of a force, but noses evolved to not block your vision. Just give it a shot and tell me the results, go to the mirror and cover one eye and then make direct eye contact with the open eye. Forcing the muscles closed and closing your eye without covering it effects the muscles in your open eye, so just cover it relaxed and tell me if you see your nose while making direct eye contact.",
