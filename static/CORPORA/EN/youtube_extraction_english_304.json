The people get along just fine, it's the two governments who are going at it, Qatar clearly being on the wrong side here, dont let the fact that they're the <b> underdog </b<b> >blind</b> you to the facts and the truth, the two governments had been talking for decades about the continuous Qatari support for terrorists  and signed agreements to limit and stop that support which Qatar didn't do, and that led to the other arab countries cutting their relations with them.",

After the Balkan Wars it was taken by Serbia, later after World War 1 the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (SCS) and after the Karadzordzevic Dictatorship the Kingdom of Yugislavia. During World War 2 Yugoslavia was invaded by the Axis and divided. Macedonia was divided between Germany,Italy and Bulgaria. During the Peoples Liberation War and after Italy and Bulgaria's capitulation/surrender Macedonia declared itself as the Peoples Republic of Macedonia, a <b> communist </b>country and constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY).

Concerning Cyprus: the Brittish where mostly in command until the end of WWII, at which point they were to be released as a state. After democratic elections Cyprus was to join Greece again, as most Cypriots feel Greek. Turkey, who occupied Cyprus before the English took over, claimed it though (it was also nice to have another reason to hate the Greeks) and invaded, leading to a Brittish-American intervention. The international community then decided to do what none wanted and made Cyprus an independand <b> nation </b>(though the Turkish government still does not accept this).\nConcerning Yemen: it is/was actually a somewhat democratic country where houti rebels, backed by Iran, try to take over, but at the same time Al Quaida rebels are active in the country with the same aim and it is the latter which Saudi Arabia is supporting. In Syria, Islamic extremists, redily supported by Saudia Arabia, had capitalised on the Arabic Spring revolution to form there country (even surpassing Saudi Arabia's aim to bully Iran, by the aim to spread salafist islam). The initial uprising had little to do with Saudi Arabia as far as I am aware of.",

The Hungarians living in Romania benefit from peace eversince they are there. They also have minority rights and Romanians get along with them even if Hungary does not like this and would rather start a war. They never owned that land, just for a brief period while Romania, just like Yugoslavia and Slovakia were occupied by the Habsburg Empire. Hungarians like to think that because of that occupation they own a lot of land in many countries. Just ask Slovakia, the Czech, Serbia. So bad bad video mate",

Abrahamic Faiths vs everyone who doesn't believe exactly the same way as they do. Yet these are peaceful religions? All are based on verbal traditions long before anything was ever written. Then they've all used psychological means like claiming \"Holy Land given by God\". My question is, when did God call all of the masses of the people on earth to let everyone know who was God's authority on the world? Because in all 3, it comes from one person when <b> nobody </b>else is around. If God created the entire universe \ud83c\udf0c long before humans ever existed, if God created everything, then when has God ever needed any human to do God's bidding? In fact, the Abrahamic Faiths caused more prejudices and<b>  racism</b> than the Pagan Faiths that they were accusing off. It's only been the last 15 years that women started becoming ministers. All 3 claims that God states that Homosexuality is a sin, but again when did God call all of the populations on the earth to make this claim? If God could speak in ancient times, there's no reason God can't speak now. Even the so called Bible, was brought together by the church leaders during the Roman Empire to Emperor Constantine by his approval. He could have cared less as long as there was peace in the empire. Pay Caesar his tribe and be happy to do it.",

When the Mullahs took over, they dictated a constitution where their ideology must be exported all over the region. Hostile escalations from Iranians never stopped ever since. We, Saudis, would love peace and prosperity to prevail across the region, but how to do so and reason with a regime that believes they have an absolute authority from a fake savior called 'Mahdi' who they claim is living in a basement over 100 years ago.

You claim that at the begining of 20th century contemporary North Macedonia was part of Greece and that it later it became a part of Yugoslavia. North Macedonia was part of Turkey until Balcan wars in 1912-1913 when most of its territory became part of Serbia. After WWI North Macedonia became part on newly formed State of Serbians, Croats and Slovenes which in 1929 was renamed as Kingdom of Yugoslavia.",

As if that is the be-all and end-all of the problem. The island is still technically at war (yes, since 1974) as a peace settlement has never been reached. The Turkish Cypriots want the Turkish mainland army to remain there as security against any possible threat from the Greek Cypriot majority to the south. The politics of the island are far too complicated for a 2-minute segment of some poorly researched click-bait video, so in future just don't bother.",

North Macedonia was Serbian land in 1914 (check it yourself) and as such entered Kingdom of Yugoslavia. It was considered Vardarska banovina (South Serbia) until 1045 when <b> communist </b>Tito overtrows Serbian Karadjordjevic dinasty from power and becomes a dictator. Not fin of Serbs because he was half Slovene half Croat, Tito decided to make internal borders sacrificing Serbs with excuse that Serbs being half of population would be too dominant (like Russians in USSR) so Tito separated South Serbia making them Macedonia (he mde that uo cause original Maceodnians were Greeks, belonging to Hellenic culture, and this Macedonians were just Serbs and Bulgarians living in Vardar Valley. They spoke Serbian with slight accent and Tito made them up a language and declare them separate<b>  nationality</b> from Serbs.\n\n\nWith Kosovo, Kosovo was the hart of Serbian empire that existed in 14th century. Then Serbian empire had their emperor Dushan misteriously die during sleep while at 50 miles from conquering COnstantinople for Serbia, and than fortunes change, Dushan son is young and unprepared, Serbian empire strugles to keep united, and Ottomans take advantage and conquer the land for 4 centruries. When Serbs start kicking Ottomans out again, North Macedonia becomes part of Serbia, while South Macedonia becomes part of Greece, with small portion of eastern Macedonia going to Bulgaria. Kosovo was allways part of Serbia, however, since Albania was the poorest country in Europe and Yugoslavia gave maximal minority rights to Albanians like university in Albanian, thousands of Albanians jumped border and came from Albania to Kosovo during the 1950s. With Serbs being Christian European society having one-maximally two children and usually sending them to big cities to university, Serbs needed hands to worl land, an<b> d refuge</b>e Albanians came well. Howver, after 2 generations, Albanians illiterate and having 12 children became majority and started wanting indepenendence maki<b> ng terrori</b>st organisation UCK which killed Serbs and unloyal ALbanians as well, put bombs in police stations and terrorised Serbs to leave. UCK was on CIA list<b>  of terror</b>ist organisations, but USA anti-Serb policy made them change it and help UCK by giving them arms and training, and even intervening directly in war against FR Yugoslavia (Serbia). USA used nasty propaganda showing terrorists killed speaking how they are civilians slaughtered by Serbs, or sho<b> wing</b> old Albanian lady with golden teeth saying she was gangrapped several times by Serbian soldiers who killed all her familly and stole everything 8BUT FORGET THE golden teeth? Hmmm not credible).... Please pay more atention to what territories Serbian controlled so you could explain better the reasons for this conflicts, you made some mistakes.",

It was the comunist party directed from moscow. Second the hungarian moved into transilvanie after the 9century and occupied it, annexed it to the austro-hungarian empire and for 9 centuries they try to colonize this part of Romania by sending germans, austriens and hungarians in Transilvania province. After the crashing of the empires like ottoman,  russian and hasburg empires Romania got his independence and united almost all the romanians in 1country. Some of the people that colonise the land remain and now make the minorities of Romania. Before the unificatian of transilvania to the mother land and before the colonization of the province by the first colonists 90% of the population of the region is held by romanians. So how can another country say that they have the right to transilvania province when they are less then 10% all the time.  Look closely in the constitution of Romania that all the minorities are represented and have equal rights. If we hated them or have peoblems of any kind with them we will not let them into the government or to have equal rights. Hungary is the aggressor they are trying to tell the world they are innocent and romanians are bad. In 2015-2017 some grups of hingarians born in Romania wanted to blow up governmental buildings with the help of russia. Last year they destroy a world war 2 cementery by profanate the burials. In some villages where 95% are hungarians they beaten up the romanians living there. In world war 2 the kill innocent civilians plunder, and rape. Look  it up! It's all there in the history books",

            "commentText": "About the No 10 \"Hate\". North Macedonia never was part of 20th century Greece. Greeks never hated North Macedonians and many greek companies expand to this north country. Also many Greeks travel to NM for shopping and tourism. The only controversial difference was the name. The ancient Macedonia and Alexander the Great was always part of the Greek history and after 1992 the Northern neighbors started to claim that they are him ancestors. The modern Greeks are friendly but until someone will touch them history. They are very sensitive with them legacy. So, after that we had an opposition between Greeks and so called Macedonians. From my point of view The Prespes agreement  put the bases of  the good neighborliness.",

            "commentText": "Cute little video but I was about to stop and dislike it from the first minute.\nThese are very complex matters to be covered in one minute.  I'll talk about the Macedonian issue, since it's the one I know most about and I can see that you picked a side there by not mentioning important details and altering some facts.\n\nYou know, you cannot pronounce the name Vergina because it's the name of the ancient capital of Macedonia and it's Greek, cannot be exactly expreced with the Latin alphabet. Just like Alexander's name, Alexandros. Vergina was the capital until it moved to Pella. Both cities lie on the original Macedonian territory, just a bit north from mout Olympus.\n\nThe Macedonian kingdom was founded by the Argead dynasty about 800 BC. Argead means \"from Argos\" a Dorean Greek city even southern than Athens. Here is one misconception, we may not have any concrete evidence wether the Macedonian people were Greek or not, but we are completely certain that all the Macedonian kings and many of their nobles were Greek. The Argead dynasty ruled the kingdom from its beggining until it was conquered by the Romans. Yes, there were Greeks that did not see Macedonians as Greeks and others that did. In 500 BC, Alexander I as current Macedonian king wanted to participate in the Olympic Games, an only Greek right. He was asked to prove his Greek origin, which he did.\n\nHere is the next misconception, the region we call Macedonia today has little to do with the ancient kingdom of Macedonia. The original region was much smaller, starting from the north side of mout Olympus and hardly reaching today's city Thessaloniki.  For many centuries it was a small and weak kingdom. The kingdom began to rise in power under Phillip II in 360 BC. He reformed the army and started conquering nearby lands. He was actually the one to found the city of Thessaloniki. The name means victory against Thessaloi in Greek because he won a battle against them there. He was the one to reach as far north as today Skopje and as East as today Istanbul. I guess we all know the extent of the kingdom under his son's rule, Alexander III (the Great). After Romans conquered the Balkans they formed the province of Macedonia containing much of the land that Philip had conquered but had to little to do with the original Macedonian kingdom and people. The same happened with Eastern Roman Empire etc.\n30 years ago a Slavic state started to claim connections with the ancient kingdom of Macedonia just because they inhabit the north corner of region that has been disconnected from the ancient kingdom for almost 2 thousand years.\n\nYou said that until 1995  FYROM was using a flag and was forced to change it by Greece. Well, 95 is 2 years after it became a country. And guess what, Greece did not just decide to trademark the Vergina Symbol. It requested that the UN recognises the Greekness of the symbol, which of course they did. So it was not a gangsta move from Greece, it was a theft attempt by FYROM that was stopped by international law.",

The beef between Greece and North Macedonia is completely irrelevant to the Ancient Macedonians - Ancient Greeks beef, hence your argument is completely invalid. In the first case we're talking about regional rivalries between the same <b> ethnic </b>group, in the second case it's 2 completely different countries with<b>  nothing</b> i<b> n commo</b>n except sharing a border, having a disagreement. You should really double check your sources before making videos like this.",

There is just a history of french elite and a dutch speaking working class (see \"lions for lambs\"). It is furthermore your basic bilingual country stuff, which got resolved in the 60's-70's. And then off course it got hijacked by politisians to go from one to seven governments and an equal amount of parliaments so they would could get more people elected. In recent years fascists are on the rise though which have once again hijacked the idea of \"the abused flemish worker man, by Walonia and foreigners\" to promote themselved flemish independence and confirm what no one knew, which is that we hate the french speaking.",

Until the break of the First Balkan War (1912-1913) the whole historical region of Macedonia was still a part of the Ottoman Empire. After the war, the whole region was split between Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia. What is now known as FYROM was occupied by the Serbs. The last time this territory was dominated by a Greek-speaking political entity was during the Byzantine Empire. And I will not get into details about the actual national identity of the Macedonian population.",

Alexander spread Hellenic culture and influence and the dynasties that ruled these newly conquered lands were greek. The people in Northern Macedonia are slavs and their migration into the Balkans didn't occur untill the 5th century. Macedonia is really called Skopj and they're Bulgarians. The Yugoslav Government brainwashed them to forget their identity and to get access to the aegean sea. So no the legacy of the Macedonian Empire is Greek not \"North Macedonian.\" I feel like you know this, but don't want to offend your North Macedonian followers.",

I dont support those clowns when they do things such as blame iran for that. It makes sense that theyre in a cold war though. But why did we react and not the saudis? I think theyre screwing us behind our back. Most of the 9/11 terrorists were saudi but where did we go? This is sad. I know we dont want another WW2 but clearly we didnt leadn anything from it.",

The influence U.K held in Argentina was removed bc the U. S feared an european foothold in South America.  See: \"With respect to the former,\r two main ideas emerge. First, Argentine neutrality was not intrinsically pro-Axis (as official USA rhetoric held), but basically pro-British (and anti-American) instead; second, Argentine neutrality, as well as that country's early post-war economic policies, were suicidal attitudes which revealed both lack of  pragmatism and megalomania on the side of Argentine decision-makers.\" (those last words were on peronism, my remark) .

We detest the fact that a foreign culture is trying to steal our history and appropriate our culture. But, in the modern era, hate is a very strong word to use. Many might detest turkey politically, for example about what's going on with the Aegean or in my case (as I'm from Cyprus) about what going on with Cyprus' EEZ and the fact that turkey doesn't recognise that islands should have EEZs. Sometimes dislike might be for historical reasons as well. What is sure, is that most people don't feel hate towards the people of turkey and the Turks and this is more true amongst new generations. This doesn't mean however that young people do not dislike some of its actions or possibly just the country or government.",

Either we will own it or you will, or maybe the yanks or someone will try and take it one day, but there is no reality where they are independent save for either someone like you being made the dictator of Argentina (a democracy would simply lead to their successor annexing the falklands) or the destruction of Argentina and potentially the United kingdom.",

But ultimately it's the same as people in \"Glendale\" getting pissed off when people say they are from Phoenix.      It's how the mind works in general :D and while it may upset some people to have their identity confused by someone who doesn't know better (or have it joked about)\n\n\nthe cool people laugh at it :)     and at everything they can!

Is by land grabbing from their neighbours with Russians help and orthodox church, took islands of ottoman empire, Macedonians, and Albanians.. these nations created Greek as known today.. as historians tell us the oldest empires on balkans were actually known as Illyrians. Today known as Albanians.. their language still exist today and different from the slavic one spoken today. now i know you all hate the truth and how it hurts y'all but its been proven many times by historians in Italy, Germany, UK, and all over the world.. take a chill pill you all and live in peace... life's too short to hate one another.. \ud83d\udc4d",

But I didn't thought it was a joke but a mistake, because I speak Spanish (AKA Castilian) fluently and we've heared Chileans, Bolivians and Peruvians speak naturally. Can't understand most of what they say. So, my point is, if one knows the reality of the situation, that every one of those countries (or even regions of them) speak very different very of Spanish, the joke is lost. They can understand each other if they make little effort, but if they speak like they do naturally, it can be inintelligible most the time.",

Also, Argentinians are lighter-skinned and there is a disdain that comes from that as well.  I have lived in both countries and, while I agree with u that it's mostly soccer-related, I have also heard the other arguments as noted above.  I am neither, \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 nor \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7, but I've seen the hate from both countries towards each other for these other reasons.  \n\nI admit, being American, it was bizarre to witness, largely because these are ridiculous things and reasons to dislike one another.  However, even when I came back to the states (\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8), I saw the rivalries persist even here in America by immigrants from both respective countries.",

Cultural genocide starts as intolerance in the governments and through propaganda and fear or misunderstanding it grows. It destroys the feeling of security that we build our communities upon and people are willing to fight and die to protect that safe feeling. Eventually the point is reached where the 'other' is no longer the sole face of fear, but your own countrymen, kith and kin, are just as responsible.
