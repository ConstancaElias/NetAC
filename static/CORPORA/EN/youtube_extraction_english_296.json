But from what I've seen when watching the seasons of this show and honestly from every time I encounter them in real life. They always seem to be inconsiderate, rude, and always disrupts and trashes the area that they walk into. They always seem to be a burden. But please educate me if this is not all of what they are truly about. I'd hate to wish their extinction if I'm only seeing the few that make the rest look bad.",

There is plenty of normal gypsies living normal or rich life which they work for. But those individuals... Its<b>  common</b> for them to date not even cousins but brother or sisters. They don't pay taxes they even get money for their many babies and its not the same amount like other races. They get more money for doin<b> g nothin</b>g. And we can't do anything.

Its says and shows that the gypsies of the UK and Ireland all originated in India. When in actual fact the majority in the UK and Ireland are Irish travellers.

And that's almost just as bad. \nGranted they're my family and they love me irregardless of whom I decide to be with. \nOr what path I choose to follow with my life. \nGranted I'm one of the only wiccans in my family and they hate it but theyd never try to make me be something I'm not just to please or appease the family.\nWell when I was younger they tried but gave up when they realized that I wasnt going to conform to them. \nNow all they care about is that I'm happy and being healthy.",

You haven't made any, you are just being argumentative and trying to make me look stupid for no apparent reason? I replied to someone who called my husbands community and life disgusting and vile and you've poked your nose in and decided you need to educate me on the fact my opinion is not the only opinion, congratulations to you for being clever enough to work that out but now you might want to apply the same principle to yourself. You are clearly biased in this argument therefore your opinion on the matter is biased and also moot as biased opinions have no place in fact and are only up for debate (which is what we were doing but apparently this debate can only be one sided since expressing our opinions leads to us being told we have none and are stupid) I am not biased toward either the travelling community or the gorgie community considering I am a gorgie and my children are travellers, I'm as entitled to my opinion as you are if not more so because I am not biased in my conclusions and having lived both lives am more qualified to talk on the subject. You're just looking for a row and it doesn't matter what I say in our defence or how I say it because the closed minded person here is you...I actually can't believe I'm still even taking the time to reply to you. When you argued back that I used the word trolls plural without even bothering to check that you were right (which you were not) that told me and everyone else exactly what your game here is. Just looking for a reaction by being biased and disrespectful... ergo...TROLL",

It's what they are all raised to believe they should have but actually it generally follows the heritage... gypsys have always put their money into gold and possessions, the amount of gold they had was a sign of their wealth but gold could always be easily sold when money was scarce, now gold is worn simply because it always has been just like some<b>  Indian</b> cultures wear a lot of jewellery. Travellers now are living in houses and living normal lives a lot of the time but they still have that belief that everything they own should be good quality and sparkling clean.\nPossessions are important and get passes along through the generations.",
