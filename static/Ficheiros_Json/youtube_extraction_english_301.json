    "commentText": "Umzantsi need the a Spiritual, Intellectual, Moral and Material Revolution more urgently than the rest of the Alkebulan continent because of the WORSE ALIENATION in their actually dramatic conditions (despite the systemic illusions and delusions that entrap them simply more than the rest of the mentally, intellectually, materially and spiritually colonized Alkebulan people). Of All the Alkebulans they are the the most alienated and ones who know less who they are, what is expected from them from our noble Ancestors since Âtum, Sét, Idrîs Ahnûh “Jëhûti”, Nûh, where they are from where they are going. Understanding the Quadratics of Real Development is understanding the problem on Umzantsi (so-called “South Africa”) as an abnormal Peripheral Colony in Delusions of Power inside a much larger alien system that dispossessed them of the most important elements of Alkebulan Wun'iyah (Civilization of Being) and even Hëpër'iyah (Culttures of Becoming) while giving them the illusion of being priviledged “political” superheros and beggars everywhere else. Nigeria is suffering a somehow similar situation with the Petrodollar Club and the illusions of “power” while commuting basic crimes that are absolutely contrary and horrific with regard to the Noble Wun'iyah and Hëpër'iyah of instructed  by the Nobles among our Ancestors, even though in an other format of delusion and alienation. \n\nThe illusions created by Empty “Political” “Power” and the brainwashing and Systemic Grooming of  “Material Prosperity” have created an ALIENATED crowd of ignorants and zombies. “The-White-Financial-and-“Spiritual”-Jesus” deep brainwashing is certainly not helping them either. Notice that the more this Alienation, Real Economic, Political and Spiritual Dis-possession Factor is présent in an colonized or neocolonized Alkebulan population the likelier these types of events to happen.",

Mandela didn't free anyone, the wealth of the country is still held by the same people it was help by before. Talking about Xhosa people like their the only black people here, Ur tribalism mindset gives me diarrhea. No black owned companies on the JSE, young black people are cramped in call centres, where they end up wasting all their potential. Our parents still don't have enough money to retire comfortably, the relationship between the black man and woman deteriorates daily, black people are trying to balance westernized culture with their own black culture which will never work, etc...this isn't freedom, it's apartheid of the mind, which is even worse bcos now white peole pretend like they like us when they don't, they tolerate us and we call that freedom...cfuk Mandela, even in his grave",

And scoffers delight them in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge?  Turn you at my reproof: Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you; I will make known my words unto you.  Because I have called, and ye have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded;  But ye have set at nought all my counsel, And would none of my reproof:  I also will laugh in the day of your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;  When your fear cometh as a storm, And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; When distress and anguish come upon you.  Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:  For that they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of Jehovah,  They would none of my counsel, They despised all my reproof.  Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own devices.  For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, And the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, And shall be quiet without fear of evil.\nProverbs 1:20‭-‬33 ASV",

I am myself a foreigner, i am against xenophobia. but we need to understand, south africans have been supporting us for too long. it s time to move to other countries in africa like nigeria (the so-called biggest economy in africa), ghana, senegal, angola, botwana, ivory coast, kenya, tanzania, mozambique, namibia, rwanda, uganda, ethiopia, gabon, ... (all of these countries are the so-called fastest growing economies in africa). WHY ONLY SOUTH AFRICA? IT'S TIME TO GO (including myself)!",

    "commentText": "A lot, if not most, Foreign Nationals only work in their own solid clusters, and not in conjunction with South Africans and have a condescending attitude towards South Africans, different people from different countries possess different skills and so this requires cooperation rather than national identity capitalisation. They circulate money among themselves and really only hire their cousins whom they have shipped in illegally unless desperate. This is working to destabilise social order and peace and the economy. The government must crack down on illegal immigration before it leads to chaos and violence in the near future! There must be real consequences for it otherwise it will never stop! people will keep flocking and we will keep integrating and integrating without discretion, that can only be foolishness! we don't even have asylum camps, we just integrate and pour immigrants into our society without clear objectives and provisions for them, Our government are slack, lazy and reactionary. they do not want to take action and authority for fear of being labelled as Xenophobic! at the cost of South Africans and their generations who should have South Africa as an inheritance, but at this pace it will be in the hands of foreign nationals and they will look back and say we were the ones who were foolish enough to allow it. We love our African brothers and sisters and the whole diaspora but this bullying by illegal immigrants and sympathetic foreign nationals using emotional blackmail is not whats going to build and secure this country and its future! Soon enough South Africans will struggle to identify what is to call their own country. That is the basis of xenophobia and it is a legitimate concern! (not that attacking is justified). Hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals are doctors and engineers and nurses and teachers and lecturers in South Africa. Thousands get degrees here every day and no one attacks them. The Xenophobia element is a reflection of two things; poor class survival on identity basis and small crime elements! and the Government Must crack down on it!!!!!",

A Malawian shot and killed two South Africans in an argument, one died on the spot, and one died in hospital, the community then decided (unfairly) that those Malawians in that part of Durban were becoming arrogant and dangerous in their community and decided to destroy the man's shop and send them away. Of-cause this is not fair because an entire people should not be judged on the actions of a few, the difference comes because African nationals usually (at least mostly) cluster themselves rather than integrate, when they have actually come to South Africa seeking asylum or refugee, and start even committing crimes. We have incidences of human trafficking, drug smuggling and syndicates, prostitution in other cases.",

At least 100 Christians in Nigeria were killed and hundreds of others injured in April, according to a human rights watchdog group warning that Fulani attacks against Christian farming communities.  Abductions, suicide bombings, and attacks on civilian targets by Boko Haram persisted. At least 1,200 people died and nearly 200,000 were displaced in the northeast in 2018. In June, at least 84 people were killed in double suicide bomb attacks attributed to Boko Haram at a mosque in Mubi, Adamawa State.  You claim to be hard working and intellegent use that in your country, by the way it's not only in South Africa that Nigerians are deemend as trouble makers all African countries feel the same about you.  I'm really dissapointed because I am one who has always been behind Nigeria to become a reconing force in Africa, truth is Nigerians are the most talented in Africa pity that it is mis-placed in insults and crime.

    "commentText": "Surely, who do South Africans think they are?. Were they colonized by other African states or the whites?... Then in chameleon like President Cyril ramaphosa calls for eviction of foreigners and the attacks just happen immediately. Then he comes on TV and condemns xenophobia, does he have the morality. Common. I used to be his admirer but that's gone. I sincerely think the young man Malema is the right person to restore SA to a normal state. He's the only one now calling for africanism whilst he's also for inclusiveness and equality and equity in SA. No one can deny that, I personally lived in the great SA and blacks are really marginalized and descriminated except the BEE.......and the only way out of it is not land expropriation, xenophobic attacks but equal treatment of all people irrespective of colour, race, religion, religion or any inclinations. I can see Julius has toned down and now calls for discussion and dialogue around equal apportionment of the resources of the country, whether land, mining et. cetera..... He looks the right person to lead South Africa and not the clown in the name Ramaphosa....... Let Ramaphosa explain the killings of Mafekeng mines a couple of years ago where he's the shareholder and a front to the white supremacists. Common SA, wake up. The solution is not in expelling whites nor attacking your African brothers.....it's all to do with corruption and the state capture!!. That's what you must do to become a nation and a respected country again",

He might be thinking that they are small subsistent business people who are indigenous to the continent of Africa and have a right to belong in South Africa whilst the white farmers have exploited the land for centuries and they literally circulate the wealth amongst themselves on land that is not of their ancestors.  I believe that Ramaposa is a fair and reasonable man and would support and protect the white farmers if they could provide him with the title deeds for the land that they currently occupy.

Some even carry out terror attacks against innocent (black) Kenyans every year like clock work. But they all agree on one thing... The vibrancy, creativity, aggressiveness,awareness, of properly educated indigeneous  Kenyans is superior to any black race on earth. Our homeliness and attitude towards visitors is HAKUNA MATATA. Diversity breeds competition and exchange of ideas and culture....oh yes Kenyans love copying and embracing foreign trends with a local twist that can't be defeated. The Apartheid demon is still alive and well in black South africa. Xenophobia is one of its proud offsprings. The self hate and crushing inferiority complex of the black majority bred by denial of basic services like empowered education, inhumane social blockades institutionalised by the Racist white elite. The black South African is consciously crippled by an ignorant system and neo- apartheid schisms that makes them wonder how these 'lesser' black people from countries with decades of civil war and anarchy can 'crawl' here and immediately start changing their fortunes for the better...while they are suffering albeit \"seeing it through white man's glasses\" (apartheid). My brothers in  WoZa, the only secret to success is brotherhood amongst yourselves first , sheer commitment and love for HardWork, sacrifice in plenty or adversity, humbling down and sampling new tricks, and some serious shrewdness in business.\nThe reality is the black South african will always be stuck in the medieval times until a renaissance or a massive awakening led by the rightly guided ones, takes grip of the country and turns it upside down. It's possible.",

Countries as a tourist bcoz you still live in a cave. You are poor, whites are rich, you can only steal and rob from them, that's why don't kill them. They'll finish you mercilessly. Tell me about the average economy of a black S.African! The whites taught you how to to be lazy and be their slaves, nothing more. Continue to live in a cave in full darkness! \nPersonally I don't want to come to SA, I've enough to eat & enjoy here. Hang yourself, don't kill others!",

And it's quite funny how this same Nigeria that you have chosen to single out was one of the main countries that greatly supported South Africa and Other African countries during their dark times. The truth of the matter is that nearly every country in Africa has had issue with same type of crimes that have been committed in Nigeria and this has affected how we are all viewed.

They divided African people and set them up against each other.  They imposed their language, religion and traditions on Africans.  This has made modern have Africans an identity crisis.  \n\nYou need to get some black pride and stop sucking up to white people.",

African migrants should go to Nigeria as the top number 1 economy in all of Africa. There is way too much immigrants in SA when SA has its own internal problems. I know that these Africans fighting each other is mainly a squabble for resources that our leaders in Africa fails to redistribute it fair to avoid the unnecessary  displacements. Packing in SA wont help South Africa themselves and many Africans that try to make a living faces this cultural differences and end up with this finger pointing African problems...Africa is way divided too much and to unite it has to begin in each and every of the African nations bringing together their tribes and end the wars. Tell me how will we unite crossing boarders if we can even unite within our own tribes in all of Africa. South Africa should get the bus ready to send Somalians, Ethiopians, Malawians, Zimbabweans, and Nigerians back home there is no wars in their country just their tribal ethnic misunderstanding that they need to deal with. South Africa has its onw internal problems to deal with as well and i don't see unity in any time soon lets face it so far as there is displacements from the bad African leadership we have and pilling up in another unresolved problems of un-shared resources wont solve our problems.. First lets get rid of thug leaders then bring in fair leaders that will invest i its people, share ideas, cultures, work together, open the boarders then travel as we please...I dont think it will ever happen so far as we still have thug leaders Africa will be in the same darkness",

Most companies are white owned and white employer want slave drivers not workers that's why they even hate unions because the unions work against their interest. \n\nLabour movements are all over the world ( all over ) and in SA white people hate them because it amounts to racism in their mind. \n\nWhen you said \"us white people leave \" I had to laugh😂😂😂 I wondered if you even have a spaza shop. Are you an employer? Being white does not mean you are an employer. Some of you are workers like us. \n\nOn social grants, you are very misinformed. Actually completely stupid. Social grants are granted to children below the age of 18yrs, orphans, permanently mentally and physically disabled, elderly. You are assuming that social grants are awarded to abled beings and particularly black because the government is creating a dependency so that we keep him in power.  Typical of white SA who speak and assume things without researching. The 17 million you are talking about is the above mentioned categories. We don't get grants just because we are black. \n\nIf you are abled bodied there is no social grant that you get. Stop assuming nonsense. \n\nI am not responsible for apartheid therefore I am also not responsible for white people wanting to leave SA. White people are reaping the repercussions of apartheid. When the black government addresses the social ills created by aparteheid laws you make yourselves belive that black people and government hate you and and are racist and  want you gone.
