        "postText": "It was too tempting an opportunity.', 'Last night the serial far-right troublemaker and anti-Muslim extremist \u2018Tommy Robinson\u2019 announced he\u2019ll be standing for the European elections in the north west region of England.', 'Quite what Robinson \u2013 or as we should really call him, Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2013 will really do in Brussels (other than perhaps trouser the money and make noise) is not clear.', 'One thing we know for certain is that anyone who votes him in will be let down.', 'For Robinson, this is just another chance to stay in the limelight, get around his recent deplatforming by social media firms, and keep the tills open.', 'He\u2019ll promise everything and deliver nothing, because this is a man who thrives on anti-politics.', 'Ironically this same man who has made potentially millions from his peddling of fake news, conspiracies and anti-Muslim hatred, and is backed by deep-pocketed anti-Muslim organisations in north America \u2013 enough to buy him a \u00a3950,000 house and take multiple holidays a year.', 'Yet he has the chutzpah to describe Nigel Farage \u2018as just another millionaire stockbroker who looks down at the working classes\u2019. Most of us would blush.', 'Like Farage, he won\u2019t be standing for Ukip (despite being an advisor to its leader, Gerard Batten) because he once belonged to the neo-nazi British National Party as well as led the violent English Defence League, and that still (just) bars you from Ukip membership, despite its descent into the far right.', 'In fact, an anti-politics mood, driven in part by Brexit (but also long-term divisions across the country) is creating fertile and dangerous conditions for extremism in Britain, which figures on the far right are keen to exploit.', 'Lennon\u2019s \u2018launch\u2019 event (a barbecue at a council estate in Wythenshawe, Manchester) got off to an auspicious start when the local housing group refused permission for his gathering to be held on its land (he went ahead anyway).', 'He was joined by his long-time collaborator in anti-Muslim extremism, Anne Marie Waters of the For Britain Movement \u2013 some of whose members are facing accusations of spreading the \u2018white genocide\u2019 conspiracy theory championed by the Christchurch terrorist \u2013 and he proceeded to break electoral laws on inducement to voting by offering free food to those turning up.', 'The most sorry tale here is that it\u2019s the voters of the north west who will be let down if someone like Lennon wins. To him, this is nothing more than another platform for self-promotion and narcissism.', 'In fact, the only thing he has done for the taxpayer is cost us money: \u00a310m to police his English Defence League, and then all those court and jail costs (18 months for mortgage fraud, 10 months for travelling on a false passport, 12 months suspended for football violence, and he still faces potentially up to two years in prison if he is convicted of contempt).', 'That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential that as many people as possible ensure they\u2019re registered to vote \u2013 by the deadline of 7th May \u2013 in order to have their voice heard on 23rd May, the date of the European elections.', 'In these Euro elections, which are held under a different system to our general and other elections, the fewer people who vote, the easier it is for extremists to win a seat.', 'So if you\u2019ve ever been appalled or angered by Lennon/Robinson\u2019s constant diet of fake news, and hatred and abuse towards others, then you need to ensure you, your friends, family and community turn up and vote.",

Much like my opinion that anyone who would support his candidacy also fiddles with little children in the underwear department. It's just an opinion. And that they are freaking out when someone calls out their great kiddy fiddler leader, acting like a bunch of precious snowflakes that they call everyone else. Spouting phrases like fake news and HUUUUUURRRRGGGHHH I GOT BIGLY ALPHA MALE BRAIN. Mostly because they are easily being lead by some utter cretin using tactics that Hitler made famous when he was running for office in Germany.But its just an opinion.",

The working class have been denied their DEMOCRATIC RIGHT OF APPROVAL on this most critical of matters by the bent dictatorial middle class elites in power and only by voting them out and replacing them with the likes of Tommy and Ann Marie, will the insanity of uncontrolled mass immigration be halted in its relentless tracks and reversed through mass repatriation.",
