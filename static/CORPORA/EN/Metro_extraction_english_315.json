        "postText": "Hannah Graf MBE is proud to have been the highest ranking transgender officer in the British Army, but she wants to remind everyone that LGBT people are \u2018just human beings\u2019.', 'Hannah, 32, who was in the military for almost a decade, has been named Stonewall\u2019s Trans Role Model of the Year 2019 for changing the Army\u2019s policies and developing a new guideline on gender identity.', 'But, she served over four years without living as her true self because she was \u2018scared of being ridiculed or lose the respect\u2019 she had earned.', 'However, when she did come out about six years ago, her commanding officers asked, \u2018how can we support you?\u2019', 'Hannah told Metro.co.uk: \u2018I became better at my job because I left my emotional baggage behind me and I could be myself.', '\u2018Transitioning is a funny thing, at the time it seems like the biggest thing in the world, but you see that it really isn\u2019t. My body was changing but my job and my family didn\u2019t.', '\u2018People worry about all sorts of random things, but apart from growing my hair and changing my clothes, the person I was didn\u2019t change.\u2019', 'She had \u2018unanimous support\u2019 when she started living as an openly transgender woman.', 'Hannah, who is married to transgender actor Jake Graf, said: \u2018People said it was a brave thing to do, but I don\u2019t think it was. It was not an option for me. It is who I am.\u2019', 'However, she has faced some backlash and been asked a series of awkward questions about her intimate parts.', 'She explained: \u2018There\u2019s a strange occurrence when you become openly LGBT. People\u2019s boundaries about what is okay to ask shifts and they start asking about your genitals and what you do in the bedroom.', '\u2018It can be quite intrusive, but it\u2019s just laughable.', '\u2018People don\u2019t ask about your genitals, why would you?\u2019', 'However, when she gets the question she\u2019s very open and always says: \u2018I think you should learn, but this is an unacceptable question.\u2019', 'Hannah, who was made an MBE on the 2018 New Year\u2019s Honours list added: \u2018Trans people are just human being, so treat us like human beings.\u2019', 'She urged other workplaces to follow in the British Army\u2019s footsteps in welcoming trans people.', '\u2018It\u2019s important to understand that there is no drain on employing trans people openly, there are only benefits, let them be who they are, it\u2019s good for their mental state,\u2019 the former soldier said.', 'Trans people who can\u2019t live as their full selves on the job have to \u2018use time and energy to live a lie\u2019, she explained, and added: \u2018You have to lie on every answer, it\u2019s draining, it\u2019s difficult and it\u2019s hard.', '\u2018Life becomes so much easier if you remove that and people can contribute to a better workplace.', '\u2018You have lots of people with different skills. If you have a team where everyone\u2019s the same, you\u2019ll have the same opinions, but with diversity you have a much wider spectre to draw conclusions from.\u2019', 'Hannah has recently left the Army and started a new career, which she didn\u2019t want to reveal just yet.', 'However, it was announced last week that both Hannah and her husband Jake have joined Arlington Talent Management.', 'The couple have also said they are ready to start a family and are looking for a surrogate.', 'Hannah said she felt \u2018privileged\u2019 to receive the award and that it was a \u2018real honour\u2019 as she vowed to continue to \u2018call out transphobia where I see it\u2019.', 'She concluded: \u2018If you come into contact with a transgender person, identity doesn\u2019t really come into to play, when you meet us, we\u2019re just human beings.', '\u2018I\u2019ll do what I can to call out transphobia. All role models are humans and we only have so much time to put into this, and try to make it worth it.\u2019",
