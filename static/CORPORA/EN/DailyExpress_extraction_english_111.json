Moreover, it's one honed by a lifetime's experience so you'll have an intuitive \"feel\" for the materials and equipment you use which is almost as valuable as the skill itself and can ONLY be acquired by long experience. Rest assured, you are not keeping younger people out of work for just that reason. People like you should be actively employed in TRAINING the next generation rather than PRODUCTION, and ensuring you skills and techniques are not lost forever. Unfortunately, most manufacturers prefer to get stuff fabricated in the third world, where skills may not be quite so good, but are a fraction of the price. Good luck to you, anyway.",

He'd be up at seven, beat the streets with an armful of CV's, most every day, wouldn't think twice about walking 10-15 miles. Went on all the recommended `courses', did his stints as unpaid \"volunteer\" if he didn't volunteer he could get sanctioned and denied his job-seekers' allowance. Finally, he found a placement in a large firm where the  manager was actually wanting to recruit a token older person. He was the only applicant over 40 years of <b> age.</b> Within 18 months he'd won their `Employee of the Year' award. He got on with his job attending to the customers, whilst the 20-somethings preferred to chat amongst themselves or mess about with their mobile phones. I also know someone in his mid-20's who fantasises about 170-quid trainers and sports cars. He's never out of bed before 11am. He's had one job interview in the last two months and told the prospective employer what HE should be paid. Two weeks later, he's still waiting for that prospective employer to ring him back...Compare and contrast, as they used to say.",
