        "postText": "\u2018More than a thousand\u2019 people stormed the Dorchester Hotel in London today in protest against anti-LGBT laws in Brunei.', 'Carrying placards and rainbow flags, campaigners banged on the windows of the building as they chanted \u2018shame on you\u2019 and \u2018gay rights, human rights\u2019.', 'The hotel is owned by the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, who recently implemented a law meaning gay men will be stoned to death.', 'To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrowser that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupports HTML5\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvideo', 'This is a modal window.', 'Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.', 'End of dialog window.', 'Earlier today, activists were thrown out of high tea at the hotel, in Park Lane, after using a loudspeaker to tell guests to boycott the facilities.', 'Since then, campaigners have blocked the entrance to the luxury inn, carrying signs that read: \u2018Money spent at the Dorchester lines the pocket of man who believes gays should be stoned to death\u2019.', 'Protester Graham, 46, told Metro.co.uk he wanted to \u2018achieve basic human rights\u2019 by rallying outside the hotel.', '\u2018This is about archaic laws being passed that bring down basic freedoms in our modern day society,\u2019 he said.', '\u2018We can\u2019t say it\u2019s not affecting us in Britain because it\u2019s affecting the world. If one country doesn\u2019t stand up to this kind of homophobia and ruthless ruling, then where does it stop?', '\u2018We have to stop it in its first tracks, the first hurdle, before the monster grows and takes over completely.\u2019', 'He continued: \u2018You might question what you can do as a small fry, but add all of those small fries together and it\u2019s a bloody big McDonald\u2019s.', '\u2018We have to do what we can and think: \u201cOkay, let\u2019s hit the University of Oxford where the Sultan of Brunei has his honorary degrees\u201d.', '\u2018Let\u2019s say to them: \u201cDo you feel comfortable to them giving this homophobic bigot a degree?\u201d They probably don\u2019t. If enough people tell them we can start to create change.\u2019', 'Bella, 22, and Lola, 17, joined the crowd to make it clear that \u2018England isn\u2019t supporting the Sultan\u2019.', '\u2018We can\u2019t just stand by as other people\u2019s rights are taken away,\u2019 they said.', '\u2018It\u2019s necessary that we act in solidarity with those in other countries where things like this happen. It\u2019s just as much our responsibility or anyone who goes to the Dorchester Hotel\u2019s as it is those abroad.\u2019', 'George Clooney and Elton John are among celebrities also calling for a boycott of the Dorchester Collection\u2019s nine hotels, which include three in the UK and the Beverly Hills Hotel in LA.', 'Deutsche Bank and estate agent Knight Frank have now banned their staff from staying there.', 'STA travel say they will no longer sell flights for the national carrier Royal Brunei Airlines while Virgin have ended a discounted arrangement with the company.', 'A spokesperson for the Dorchester Collection said that \u2018inclusion, diversity and equality\u2019 were the \u2018foundation\u2019 of the company.', '\u2018We understand people\u2019s anger and frustration but this is a political and religious issue that we don\u2019t believe should be played out in our hotels and amongst our 3,630 employees,\u2019 they said.', '\u2018We\u2019re deeply saddened by what\u2019s happening right now and the impact it is having on our employees, guests, partners and suppliers in particular.', '\u2018Our values are far removed from the politics of ownership.\u2019', 'There have also been calls for the Commonwealth to expel Brunei from the group, although it is expected they will opt to apply diplomatic pressure instead.', 'The University of Oxford is now said to be reconsidering the decision to award an honorary degree to the Sultan in 1993.', 'In a statement, the university said it shared the \u2018international revulsion\u2019 of the laws and that the decision to confer the honorary degree of civil law would be reexamined through an \u2018established process\u2019.', 'They added: \u2018We also believe in due process. Just as nobody has a right to confer an honorary degree, nobody has a right summarily to rescind it.', '\u2018The decision to confer this degree 26 years ago was recommended by a committee and approved by council and by congregation at the time.', '\u2018We will reconsider this decision through our established process in light of the information now available, as other British universities are doing.\u2019', 'Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
