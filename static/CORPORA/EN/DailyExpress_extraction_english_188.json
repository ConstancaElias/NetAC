The Deutsche Bank being one of the major players causing the crash, described by a US Senate committee as a financial snake pit rife with greed, conflicts of interest and wrongdoing.They were involved in trading CDO 's and CLO's, financial products deemed to have played a role in the 2008 crash.The Deutche Bank being the 4 th fourth - biggest player in the CDO and CLO business.They were also accused of tax avoidance schemes.Shortly before the crash, it was David Javid who was global head of the bank\u2019 s emerging markets structuring group, responsible for structuring all credit products for emerging market clients and all emerging market risk products for all Deutsche clients, the bank described it at the time, then Javid moved to Singapore as head of global credit trading Asia, to take charge of the bank\u2019 s cash and derivative credit trading as well as CDOs.He also sought to avoid tax on his\u00a3 3 m - a - year earnings as a Deutsche Bank investment banker.Javid left Deutsche Bank in 2009, just as the full extent of its credit - related losses were becoming clear.A former colleague told Euromoney that he was amazed at how Javid was\u201c spinning his former career\u201d as a sober banker, as opposed to a structured credit trader involved in the business that precipitated the global financial crash.",

And the Tories not only impose Austerity on the people to pay for the Global crash caused by the banks and bail them out as they were \"too important to fail\", but then give Javid the keys to number 11 as Chancellor. Disgusting. Unreal ignorance by those blinded by Tory media lies and dogmatic hatred for those less fortunate, who were actually made to suffer more and more under Tory rule. It's the greedy rich everyone needs to blame, not the poor, and the Tories for lying to everyone with every breath they take.",

Any country who can give their MPs a 17 % salary increase whilst their people are struggling to pay their rent is living under deceitful government. Any country who can afford to give 7 % of their taxpayers money to foreign aid whilst people at home do not have decent schools. hospitals or housing is a bureaucratic government. Any country who continues to put its people in danger and tells them their country is no longer a proud democratic <b> nation </b>is effectively living under a totalitarian regime. UK has slowly been sold to the corrupt, federal project called European Union.Unless we can drain this fetid swamp our grandchildren will be looking in the face of marxism at its worse.",

We rented in Spain for a while and had NO water bill and NO  council tax bill to pay as the landlord covers the cost and the size of the property was twice the size of our tiny property here and sunshine morning till dusk and a swimming pool in the back garden.   What is there not to like and where they insure your car, NOT the person so anyone can drive it and car insurance actually went down the second year we were there.   Then they wonder why people want to move abroad.",

Insults to one another is a total waste of time.  The system needs a overhaul.  About 80% of the contents of Parliament are there for their own ROTTEN ambition and ego.  They need to go.  They should all behave like perfect gentlemen and ladies, and dress correctly for the occasion too, show respect for one another - If they toe the line, then nobody would get punched at people's front doors during elections.  That is exactly what \"the people\" want to do, after past 12 months in the Commons - punch their lights out, and anyone who represents them - it is horrible, but they have brought it on themselves by FAILING in their job.  WE NEED DIGNITY, HONESTY AND RESPECT in Westminster - not pigs at the trough!!",

We have both have tax allowances in our own right, mine comes well under the threshold and the wife 's is well under so I fail to understand how this goon could tax a joint income unless they completely revamp the tax system which isn't going to happen.We also do not benefit from married allowance, G.Brown took that off us on Labours last watch.We claim no other benefits.We are financially OK....at the moment but the future with the Marxist party could tip the balance and leave us in poverty. However, the economy is finely balanced with low inflation rate should Catweasle and that clown of a shadow Chancellor get into No .10 and 11 I can see inflation climbing to higher than the 25 % we endured in the late 70 's, their sums even to a layman do not add up, our credit rating will be at rock bottom once these plans of their's get going then what ? Unfortunately there are some very thick blinkered people out there even in our town that think being a socialist is a good thing only trouble is they use the word in a different context these Marxists.When saddo Corbyn 's idea of a day out with the family is to visit and study Karl Marx's grave that should speak volumes!",
