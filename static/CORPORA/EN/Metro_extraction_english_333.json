        "postText": "It looks like 20 gay-teen didn\u2019t end with the tolling of the bells at midnight on 31 December, because we have a new LGBTQ+ icon on our hands.', 'It has been decided that Luigi of Super Mario Bros fame is transgender and we are welcoming them with open arms.', 'This theory became canon in the minds of many gamers after Nintendo\u2019s update on the Super-Crown in New Super Mario Bros Deluxe, the Nintendo Switch rerelease for New Super Mario Bros. U and New Super Luigi U.', 'The Super-Crown temporarily turns Toadette into Peachette, which fans took to mean that any character could transform into a female \u2013 meaning Bowser could become Bowsette.', 'Nintendo decided to nip this theory in the bud on the game\u2019s website, writing: \u2018\u201cWhen Toadette finds one of these, she can transform into the super-powered Peachette. (Sorry Luigi\u2014only Toadette can use this item!)\u2019', 'Now, Luigi has been known to try on a dress from time to time in the past \u2013 take the plumber crossdressing as Peach to trick Bowletta into releasing the real Princess Peach in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga.', 'However, when Toadette puts on the Super-Crown, she\u2019s not only given Peach\u2019s dress, but Peach\u2019s body.', '', '', '', 'I know that it\u2019s probably getting annoying but I will continue posting about the fact that Luigi is canonically trans until the day I fucking die (except not right now because I gotta get some sleep gn)', '\u2014 FrostyMac 2 (@FrostymacH) January 6, 2019', '', 'Trans Lesbian Luigi pride flag pic.twitter.com/66ZonygALL', '\u2014 Kayla ? (@kob_critic) January 6, 2019', '', 'Adding more weight to the theory is Yoshi calling Luigi \u2018mama\u2019 in Super Mario World, and all of the times Luigi wears dresses or remarks how comfortable they look throughout the series.', 'We don\u2019t know if Luigi is actually transgender, or is cisgender, or is gender non-conforming \u2013 but we support them no matter what.",
