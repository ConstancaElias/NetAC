        "postText": "An expectant mother claims she was rejected by a midwife for being vegan.', 'Brittany Davis, 30, had found the midwife, who specialises at at-home birthing, online earlier that day and arranged a meet-up with her via email.', 'But she said 30 minutes into their meeting, the woman started quizzing on her intake of proteins, vitamins and calcium after discovering she maintained a plant-based diet.', 'Brittany said she then \u2018quickly shut down\u2019 the conversation, after being told she\u2019d have to eat \u2018tonnes and tonnes\u2019 of her usual diet to meet the \u2018nutritional needs of a pregnant woman\u2019.', 'She claims the midwife left the meeting stating that she would have to \u2018really think\u2019 about working with her, as previous vegans she\u2019d worked with \u2018just didn\u2019t cut it\u2019.', 'The next day, Brittany, who is 13-weeks pregnant, received a text stating that the woman would only work with her if she considered eating meat and dairy again.', 'Her message read: \u2018Thought carefully about us working together\u2026 Thinking we might stress each other out with \u201cveganism!\u201d', '\u2018If you could find will to return to classic \u2013 maybe paleo diet even \u2013 it might work \u2013 I\u2019m of the mind that you are building \u201can animal of sorts\u201d & need animal protein \u2013 esp during pregnancy!', '\u2018You starting off with \u201cweak blood\u201d by my standards\u2026. Blood is the river of life!! Let me know if you want to talk further\u2026 I enjoyed meeting you & Garrett!\u2019', 'She also sent a picture of a book labelled \u2018Real Food for Pregnancy\u2019.', 'Brittany, from Central Iowa, said the message made her feel \u2018defeated\u2019 at first, but then \u2018relieved\u2019 once she realised the midwife was not the person for her.', 'She said: \u2018I\u2019ve been vegan for over two years, so how could I have lived this long and become pregnant again if we were so deficient in these important things needed for development?', '\u2018All I\u2019d say is that she should have researched more before shooting down the idea of working with a vegan entirely to try and get a better understanding of it.\u2019', 'The independent consultant added that it is not the first time she has experienced a backlash for her diet, as her two-year-old son is also \u2018fully vegan\u2019.', 'She said: \u2018For the first six-months, at least once a week, I was explaining to people that it is possible to raise a child vegan and not have them be malnourished.', '\u2018I would keep track on an app what I\u2019d feed him everyday and if someone brought it up I would show them the app \u2013 it happens a lot less often now.', '\u2018I also track my own nutrients and take prenatal vitamins and supplements to keep myself and my baby healthy.\u2019', 'A varied and balanced diet is essential during pregnancy, the NHS website states.', 'However, vegetarian and vegan mums-to-be can find alternative ways of getting enough calcium, iron and vitamin B12, which are commonly found in meat and dairy.', 'Dark green vegetables, wholemeal bread and dried fruits are all good sources of iron, while unsweetened soya drinks and yeast extract items like Marmite can provide vitamin B12.', 'Calcium can also be found in dark green leafy vegetables, rice and oat drinks, brown and white bread and calcium-set tofu.', 'The NHS recommends that all women consider taking a daily supplement of vitamin D.",
