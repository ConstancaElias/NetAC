 "postText": " Hilarious Photos That Show A Generation Gap At Its Best. Generation gap is the difference of opinions and values between two generations. We often hear people from the older generation says how this generation always stuck to their devices, how they suppose to wear their clothing, how they always stay indoor. This remarks seem like we are living in a two different world, or maybe we are. Try showing a teenager a tape-recorder cassette or a GameBoy, most have no idea what they are now. These hilarious photos shows that it's not just a gap but rather an abyss between this two generation.  What's your experience with generation gap? Tell us more in the comment section!

Now I’m not going to pretend that your lives were easy or perfect, but Mother Earth had a lot less problems then than now, so anyways I’m with the story. Baby boomers then decided that taxes were stupid and basically you brought the nation into outstanding debt almost single handedly, then when the reports and evidence of climate change came though, y’all didn’t care! Factories were making YOU money and stuff YOU wanted. So instead of fixing your mistake, you dumped all that sh*t on the younger generations to try and clean up. But wait! There’s more! A majority of the government is influenced by mostly boomers, who seem to oppose change, and also boomers don’t exactly support mental health.\n\nSo yes, I’m sorry your jealous Boomers, but think about all of the things you had, and took away from us when you were the majority.\n\np.s (this is the majority of the boomers, but certainly not every boomer ever)",

Just because technology has advanced doesn't mean we have to continue using the obsolete devices of the past. The only advantage an old analog television will provide over an HD unit is the feeling of nostalgia, and that only applies to a certain amount of people. All of these are a result of time; how do you think older generations felt in the 1950's, when the television exploded in popularity and became internationally known? If you're into the older pop culture and devices, good for you. But don't judge others for enjoying something that wasn't in your childhood.\n\n\nEDIT: If you're young and enjoy something of the past generations, no need to shame your peers who don't. When you do this, you only come off as pretentious, not smart.",

That’s me.\n#2 I’ll play the real table tennis 😏\n#3 How I dress today: Sports team t-shirt and tracksuit pants (the other name is also sweat pants). Oh, and some blue runners.\n#4 Thats relatable, you can see the old folks in my house talking to the Google home mini in there free time.\n#5 Oof.\n#6 I’m that old photo in 2019. Short hair and a cozy t-shirt with the pooch. Only if mine was alive and a lot nicer.\n#7 Me when I see a gumball machine: Come to me, my pretties.\n#8 My table at Starbucks would be full of Granola containers....it’s so tasty...\n#9 I know who Steve Irwin was, he’s the guy that got killed by the sting ray, right?\n#10 Me: (has an iPhone 6.) I don’t care if people have the iPhone X... we only need longer charger cords.\n#11 I know what he means. It means get off the phone.\n#12 The 13 year old me (I’m close to that age): Is very tomboyish and drawing quality is improving.\n#13 I still haven’t finished that LEGO Harry Potter set. I ran out of the block with 6 lumps on it... I was so flipping close...\n#14 The only thing that’s all over my phone are drawings I drew on my iPad and airdropped them onto my phone.\n#15 I’m a 2000’s kid and I have a Game and Watch, Game boy, Game boy advance, NES, SNES, N64, Wii, Wii U, Nintendo Switch and a Nintendo 3DS XL.\n#16 Don’t worry, my mum wants to buy those things that play music from these discs. I forgot the name, was it called a record?\n#17 If I were going to a party, I’d wear some jeans and a white t-shirt. Y’know, I’m a simple person.\nOk, I’ll stop because I’m too lazy to keep going 😏",

    "commentText": "So this is a common but over used trope at the moment so we're going to break this down a bit. \n\n1. The difference between how 13yr olds dress now vs 10 or 20 years ago can be explained through the sexualisation of minors that our media (owned by straight old white men) pushes. Now children are being told they need to look good or a certain way instead of being allowed to be kids. This is intentional and it's large scale grooming of young girls (afab people). Don't blame them, blame creepy adults. \n\n2. Children using technology instead of toys is not their fault. A child doesn't just get an iPad or tablet from no where. The parent made the decision to give them one and to just put them in front of it day in day out. My neice do3snt have a tablet. She has toys. She gets to watch some tv after school if she's been good. But mostly she plays with her toys and makes up games. Don't blame or mock the child. Look to education parents to do better by their children. \n\n3. Younger people on their phones doesn't make them ignorant or stupid. I can't text and message people on my phone. I check in with my disabled mother when out. I can check bus schedules as well as my bank balance all from my phone. I can check the news too and get live updates online. I do a lot of work from my phone and most of the time young people can carry out maybe 3+ conversations on their phone plus real life interactions. Stop assuming that phones make young people dumb when it's been proven to do the opposite. \n\n4. Old fashioned news papers and such are not better than online/technology. We currently have a climate emergency. The productions of news papers and such does not help with this at all. It's also always big corporate businesses and puppets for billionaires who publish/write in these papers where as online anyone can do it meaning that fair and independent news is possible.",

I used to judge age by whether anyone could remember the \"Cold War\" (which ended in 1989) and, thanks to my granddaughter's \"revelation\" to me, I now realize that anyone old enough to have even been around when it was going on is already 30.  The longest, most defining event of my life is no more relevant to them than was Prohibition to me - and even that isn't as shocking as the tarted up, prematurely sexualized little girls in this video.  Worse, it only takes one or two girls presenting that way at a school to put irresistible pressure on all the other little girls to conform.  Those are their peers and their competitors for attention, for boys, for status - and you cannot be the parent who puts their kid at the social disadvantage she would suffer if she tried to remain a kid a bit longer.",

That is literally my grandfather. in his mid sixties, complains at me all day about my video games but he spends literally every moment that he has free time on his tablet on facebook or watching TV. Sometimes he's even complained at me WHILE STILL USING HIS TABLET. Like he doesn't even look away from it while he's talking to me about how I spend too much time on technology. Yeah, never mind that medical conditions make it near impossible for me to go anywhere and I have literally no other source of entertainment - I'm just lazy!",

No cables, no chromecast, no roku etc. Life then wasn't boring or mundane at all. I actually think we were more productive. 🤔",

Seems like kids can’t even be kids and obsess over Disney channel movies and read 17 magazines to see which Jonas Brother is right for you anymore. It’s all about tight clothing and makeup which is FINE I suppose but not at 11, 12, 13 yrs old. Honestly if I could go back to my middle school & HS days I would’ve never even focused on makeup or appearance, sex or ANYTHING of that nature and took everything more seriously. Especially the way I treated people. Nowadays it’s all about looking & dressing a certain way & honestly I feel bad for all these kids growing up. Makes you not even wanna try for kids in the future bc like damn it’s gonna get even worse :-( thx for reading if u did I promise there ain’t any hate at all; these girls are beautiful I just really pray they don’t think that their looks alone is gonna get em far cause it’s such a shallow & unrealistic way to look at one’s  self-worth based on outward portrayal.",

I can't remember what I watched on TV, I didn't own a phone or a computer, but I remember what I did with my friends. Right now I don't have school anymore and many friends aren't there so I spend more time with my phone, but honestly, I can't remember half of the things I watched on YouTube (or at least I don't think at it), but I can remember every minute I spend with other people.\nIn 10 years, what do you want to tell others what you did this time? \n\"Just chillin' around\" or do you want to tell them exiting stories about what you experienced? \n\nSorry for my long reply, but I believe that spending too much time before the screen on a too young age isn't good for the people. I can understand spending some time on the phone, but that doesn't make you happy, maybe in the moment you are doing that, but not for life. And young people have a better opportunity to spend time with their friends because they usually have more free time, they should use that time",

We had to use pay phones if we weren't home. Even though I waited longer then most my first cell phone was in 06. I was in my early 30s. Lol! In the mid 90s 98% of everyone did not have a cell phone let alone a teenager or even people in their 20s. In the last 20 years tech has boomed so much that the mid 90s were almost the dark ages.

My parents were getting up there when they had me and I didn’t have my first son until I was 30. I’m 35 now and my 4 year-old is getting into playing some of the older video games I kept. I actually still have an original Tetris that works on my Gameboy Advance SP. Sadly no original Gameboy that works (crazy battery muncher that it was) but still, my boys will grow up with some old stuff around. \n\nI’m a barely millennial. Lol I grew up with a lot of the “ancient technology” shown but also love all of the new stuff and keep up with upgrading everything. I have to say being able to stream movies/TV shows is amazing. I don’t miss a million DVDs cluttering my home. I don’t think I’ll ever become so old that I refuse to embrace change.",

Is the successor phrase now going to be \"the greatest thing since seedless weed\"?  What an amazing transition I've seen.  When I was born (and well into my adulthood and professional life) everybody smoked tobacco - in restaurants, in airplanes, even in court (it wasn't even considered d isrespectful to light up while addressing the judge) and, of course, having enough weed on you to roll a doobie could land you in jail for 5 years (at least you were allowed to smoke there - and at your trial, too).  Now my town is inundated with cannabis shops, nobody is stuffing wet towels under their doors to staunch the smell, and that delicious sense of paranoia and dread which used to accompany every toke is a thing of the past.  Ah, but try to find a smoking section anywhere or a tobacconist's shop.",

Then she wanted to open a window, so she pressed the first button she found on the door, she pressed it and nothing happened.

This is going to be long scroll away if you dont want to waste your time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was born on 2001 and as a kid i mostly had those 90s things. I had both a dvd player and a vhs player ( whenever i see a vhs i remove those tape things inside and play around with them ), my dad gave me one of the portable disk mp3 players ( I broke it when i was 4 )i had a 'phone' when i was 5 it was a old nokia phone but it never worked. I used to play snake and this certain game where you bounce on clouds ( idk whats its name tbh ) on my mums phone. I used to play on a ps1 when i was 5 then it had got spoiled so my dad got me a ps2 when i was 7 ( i still have the ps2 and it works ) as a kid i really loved to play with sand when my family and i go to the beach and i loved crayons. I played a lot of football ( soccer ) and i used to ride my bike with my friends every day ! Oh and finally i loved toys like legos, hotwheels, ( any car toy, just give me one and ill play with it ).\n\nNow i just stare at my phone the whole day, play ps4 most of the times and just study !",

    "commentText": "Guys I never had a phone until I was 18. You better not be giving a 6 year old iPhones. I'll slap the fuck outa ya! I'm 19 now and I grew up with Nintendos from the 90s, DS's, and tablet's from later on. You guys I got excited when I saw a gumball machine. I still do. Because the little things in life matter. Not some stupid piece of technology that your gonna break before a year of having it. I can't believe kids today and their parents. They stupid going gaga after a fucking computer chip! You know what I did I spent time in the arcade playing the crane machine and racing games. That's way more fun In my opinion. And that kids is why the old people hate our generation because \"we\" (meaning you cause I don't give a shit for technology) act like stupid children because you can't stand to be away from your phone or your computer or laptop or tablet! You a bunch of inbreed monkeys if you can't.",

In the first grade there was this girl who had a flip phone (not sure what they're called in English) and I was stunned because how and why did her parents get her one. Years later - middle school - I got my own phone, a Nokia with buttons, just so I could talk easier with my family during summer camp. The others treated it like it was the most modern thing ever. Then touchscreen phones came out and I was like \"nope\" cause they were so clunky at the time. Now I have an Android, online all the time etc but it still pisses me off when I see toddlers playing with tablets or people who \"hang out\" together but instead just tap on their phones. Especially the latter. WTF dude.",

Don't you see that you're the one embarrassing yourself here? You keep making others just get more, and more mad at you! If you're so smart,  then why don't you prove it?! Yes,  I know your grammar in English is good, but intelligence is not only seen through their fluency in one language. It is seen through their way of thinking and their knowledge. Try to learn another language!  If you're better than all of us,  then that's the time you can go back here and talk bad about us.  Thank you for reading my opinion, have a NICE DAY!!\n\nP.
