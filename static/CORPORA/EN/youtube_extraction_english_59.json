I'm not saying that men are not being sexist, I'm saying there are more men in general when it comes to the sport world, with the exception of a few female sports, most male sports are in higher demand than female ones. Case in point male vs female gymnastics, look at the break down in terms of coverage. Make gymnasts are almost never shown when their events are held. Often times being viewed weeks later or not at all. In the case of the WNBA it was given a big push in advertising, and marketing, and still it did not pull the number that would warrant a vast amount of support",

I don't think male athletes go through the amount of <b> sexual </b>harassment/comments that female athletes have to go through. One of the biggest reasons women quit sports is because of the harassment involved. And it's not just the harassment, it's your competence being judged by your<b>  sex</b>. I've tried joining hockey, martial arts, football and so on, and I can't find teams that accept females because it's so goddamn dominated by males, which isn't a bad thing, it just gives females less of an opportunity to join. \nMaybe these people didn't portray it the way you wanted, but the point remains. Sports media is sexist.",

It might be a stereotype that all teenage girls spend their time at the mall but it does happen a lot. The comment itself had no sexist reasoning behind it. I picked it up as a statement merely about the very young <b> age </b>of the girls. They are young and what they have done was very special. The next thing where I think the anger was misplaced was the anger about the breast implant article on website hollywood life. I agree it is<b>  weird</b> that that was the subject the website was talking about but it but the article was written by <b> a woma</b>n. The impression the video gave me was that men were being sexist towards women athletes. There was no man being sexist in this case. Nevertheless I think the ultimate message is good but maybe next time you guys can be more clearer of the issue you are trying to discuss.",

            "commentText": "1. Adam Kreek: Maybe she wants something different than to be a competitor.\nVox: He [Adam Kreek] describes her as \"not being a competitor\"\nA) Acknowledge the word maybe\nB) He never said she not a competitor. He talked about what she might want. To the contrary, he recognized her as a competitor by saying that she might not want to be. If she wasn't a competitor than such an assertion wouldn't merit being mentioned.\n\nAnd about what you said following the clip of him, he never mentioned disinterest. He acknowledged that she has many options and that as much as she may be interested in competing, she may take another either additional or substitutive path. Ever think that maybe by saying \"different than to be a competitor,\" he means more than to be a competitor?\n\n2. What was the context for the \"they might as well be standing in the middle of a ball\" NBC clip? Why didn't you provide it? But anyway... Why would he suggest that women belong in a ball rather than competing in a women's competition? Wouldn't a sexist agree that a women's gymnastics competition is a fitting place for women? If he were being sexist, why wouldn't he say all of the teams belong in balls?\n\n3. Next. They show the male and female coaches all the time for male and female athletes.\n\n4. Okay, that's kind of sexist, but she isn't simply being outshined by her husband or thought of only as the wife of a man. Her husband is a BEARS' LINEMAN! He's certainly more notable than her and they didn't give his name either. So it wasn't \"Women are first and foremost the wives of their husbands.\" It was \"This particular <b> woman </b>is the wife of an NFL player.\" And mentioning the Bears probably gave them a lot of retweets and likes, so they were partly motivated by wanting more likes and retweets, not entirely, or even necessarily in part by,<b>  sexism</b>. \n\n5. Clearly he was referring to singles tennis. He wasn't being sexist. The two women with more than one Olympic gold metal in tennis as well as the four other men with the same have no more than one gold metal in singles tennis. He is the first person, male or female, to be awarded two or more Olympic gold metals in singles tennis. Again, not only have two women been awarded two or more Olympic gold metals in tennis, but four other men have as well. They all only have at most one Olympic gold metal in singles tennis. By the way, the women who \"broke\" that record, a different record than the one to which the reporter was referring, broke it after men had. So obviously a man isn't taking credit for a record broken by women, especially since they didn't actually break it.\n\n6. So far, you've had the weakest case regarding charge number five. This is kind of sexist but Michael Phelps is a big name. People really care about him and it's not because he's a man. When people see his name, they will buy the paper.\n\n7. You didn't provide sufficient context and I'm still a bit confused about what happened here.\n\n8. Hollywoodlife.com is about that kind of stuff. It's not real news. You knew this or at least should have.\n\n9. Where doe<b> s se</b>x factor in?\n\n10. How are we supposed to find this article to confirm what you've claimed about it?\n\n11. What does t<b> he ra</b>ce of sports news editors have to do with this?",

That really shouldn't offend anyone. \n\nHungarian Swimmer:\nThe guy was her coach and mentor. He got her into swimming and coached her into competition. Without him she wouldn't be there. \n\nChicago Tribune:\nThe magazine doesn't mention the name or sport of the girl because no one cares. Let's look at this. She is a trap shooter, most Chicagoans, like me, have no idea what that is. There for no one has ever heard this girls name. But we do know the Bears lineman. While even then they don't mention his name either. They want people to click on their article. Who are Chicagoans more likely to recognize? A trapshooter or a bears lineman.\n\nBBC:\nHe was probably referring to men's tennis. This isn't<b>  sexism</b> it's a reported failing to think through his story. \n\nLedecky:\nI do believe that this is an American article. Ledecky isn't a CANADIAN swimmer. Literally everyone in the US knows Michael Phelps like how every Jamacian knows Usain Bolt. Phelps is a American icon while Ledecky is a Canadian star. Which would Americans care about more?\n\nMercury News:\nEh, no big deal. It's just a quick tweet. \n\nSports Editors:\n90% of sports editors are white b/c more men care about sports than women.",

Oh poor men that Islam makes you not have to do something. Personally I keep my beard long due to pure laziness, but I understand that the struggle is real. Also hijabs/burkas/burkinis are a personal choice like to apply skin lighteners and only speak when spoken to and to be submissive to one's husband as a slave is to his master. Gosh the world is so full of beautiful diversity! It's a shame though, that people get so racist-phobic, murder-phobic, oppression-phobic, and other made-up words to describe justified outrage!\n\nP.S. Islamic terrorism is real. If we're going to care so much about feelings, shouldn't we say that wearing a hijab is insensitive and intimidating to all the people who have been murdered by Islamic terrorists personally or who know people who were murdered by Islamic terrorists? Just an idea. Maybe we could make a new Olympic rule that murder-laced ideological clothing should be banned if that ideology continues to murder people around the world, in the real world, right now? But I guess some people's feelings are worth more than others.",

This smug, sarcastic commentary contrasts greatly with the usual even-headed, well-written/researched voiceovers that I'm used to. In addition, there were a few points that I didn't agree with at all. For example, the commentators only mentioned Hosszu's husband because he is also her coach, who is usually someone that is quite integral to an athlete's achievement. Also, when the remark about the gymnasts being in a mall was made, it was made in reference to how comfortable they looked, and how much fun they seemed to be having. Sure, the comment lacked a little tact, but you can't say that it was part of some sexist war being waged by NBC. Both of these examples would have seemed a lot less offensive if some context was provided. I thought Vox videos were made to inform people about pressing issues or just interesting topics, but this video seems like it was made for the sole purpose of stirring up vitriol from the audience. I'm just disappointed.",

It would be the same way if a male swimmer would have been unwilling to compete and his wife motivated him to train and win a medal. Similarly, the Chicago Tribune tweet would have been the same if it would have been, say, Katie Ledecky's husband winning a gold medal. More people can relate to the story if there is a mention that the man was married to a household name like Ledecky. And finally, saying that those five gymnasts \"might as well be standing in the middle of the mall\" was meant to show they were absolutely comfortable in that environment since they just annihilated the competition and were laughing and joking. If it would have been five men who just annihilated the competition and they were laughing and joking around, what if the commentator would have said, \"They look like they might as well be standing in the stands at a football game\"? No man would find that sexist It wasn't meant to demean the girls, it's just a REGULAR ACTIVITY that women do. If you want to deny that women like shopping you probably don't know many of them.

The fact that they showed a close up of HIS face when SHE won the<b>  race</b> they says a lot too, I mean you could argue it was because he looked so excited and happy, but the commentators could have said something like, \"here's her husband celebrating and looking very proud of his partner's achievement\".

            "commentText": "Vox - <b> sexism </b>was an issue in this Olympics, but Liz Plank's presentation is horrible, and the writing for this episode was terrible too. First off, you tried to make it funny and it isn't funny because there are no jokes. Simply pointing out a thing that happened, and telling your audience \"Look how ridiculous that is!\" doesn't make a joke funny. It's about delivery, timing, and set up. You have a decent set-up. The premise being you're addressing<b>  sexism</b> like it's an Olympic sport - but if the premise is good, you don't need to mention it explicitly. It would be implied. Saying the premise explicitly means you think your audience is stupid. Delivery is not good. Frankly, Liz is too animated. If you're presenting this as if you're a sports caster, then it would be funny if Liz actually tried to act like one with the \"news anchor voice\" and demeanor. Liz tries to make these bits funny by pointing out the ridiculousness of these sports reporter's sexist comments, but it comes across as high & mighty and condescending. Timing is an issue too. These bits come one right after the other. Give the audience time to think about the sports reporter's comments, and take the time to actually write some decent commentary about the interaction. You give the facts and then do a quick one sentence bit about it. Actually dedicate some writing time to each interaction so the audience can have time to mull it over and slow down the pace a bit like in the other videos you guys have where you address topics seriously. This is why people are saying the video is \"unprofessional,\" but really it's because it just isn't funny. Sexist jokes can be funny, but this video just is not. Your serious videos are way better - stick with that because you guys are not comedians.",

And maybe this kind of format could work with some tweaks: John Oliver and Samantha Bee make stuff like this work. But Vox strikes me as a  the kind of place I wouldn't expect to see a glib, <b> cheesy </b>takedown of media coverage. And the \"commentator\" almost makes me pause because it's so bad that it seems like she's being ironic, and actually lampooning feminists or something. It doesn't not sound genuine.

I agree with a few things like not mentioning the athlete's name and disregarding the records set by Williams sisters.\nThe fuss about giving the credit of that swimmer's achievement to her husband was a little too much as we don't even know the whole story! Maybe he did have a hand in training her for Olympics or supported her throughout her training or whatever. Of course, it's the athlete who put in most of the efforts but don't we usually give credit to the coach of the team when they win a big tournament? if it isn't wrong then, then why is it wrong here? Now a lot of people will call me sexist for giving a man a benefit of doubt. But, think about it. Would that be fair?",

(humans do not respond as well to the female voice when compared to a male voice, ). Its called subconscious bias, its when you make a decision on something because of an arbitrary feature, rather than objectively looking at what is being presented, which 60+% of people have done on this video.\nThere is a study done with people, where they were told story of successful (real) businesswoman and identical story of a  fictional businessman. The people were asked to rate the her/'him\", and people did not like the <b> woman,</b> yet the IDENTICAL story of the man was ok simply because of the arbitrary<b>  gender</b> switch. \nYeah, arrogance gets annoying, and so does ignorance.  Equality for everyone is better for everyone so uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, get with it",

The tennis player comment is because she was on a losing streak and he suggested maybe she is in it more for the endorsements instead of winning tennis matches.....this wouldn't be the first time a female OR male athlete has been accused of that. The twirl from the Australian commentator was stupid, I'll give you that one.\n\n2.The gymnasts comment was about their $2500 uniforms, not about them....Nice try, though.\n\n3. Hosszu's husband took over as her swimming coach after her swimming career was plateaued with her former coach. Thus he is responsible for turning her career around. It's called coaching, would you not have had a problem with it if she was a <b> lesbian </b>and her wife was her coach and turned her career around?\n\n 4. The Chicago Tribune covers a professional football team named the Chicago Bears, maybe you've heard of em. Cogdell is NOT a native of Chicago, as she is from Alaska. Here is the<b>  CRAZY</b> part....CLICK THE LINK....OMG, what is the title of the article....? \"Corey Cogdell, wife of Bears lineman Mitch Unrein, wins bronze in Rio\" \n\n5. Both Venus and Serena each only have ONE Gold Medal in Tennis singles. There Gold's have mostly come in doubles. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Andy Murray played singles.\n\n6. While Katie Ledecky is going to be very close, if not surpass Phelps medal count when her Olympic career is over. Michael Phelps IS and WAS the worldwide star of the Olympics since 2008, why would he NOT be the headline, ever?\n\n7. This literally ha<b> s ZER</b>O to do wi<b> th sexi</b>sm and 100% to do w<b> ith rac</b>ism.\nendquote\n\nThere might certainly be a problem with rascism/sexcism/anti-feminism/bias etc. But what's happening now is that on the Internet people just shout, they shout and shout and shout exactly what other also shout. This is the essence of the so called social justice warriors, they problems they focus on in society are certainly worth debating about, but the sheeplike manner in which this SJW movement is discussing it makes absolutely no sense at all. It's all about everybody's feelings and less and less about the actual context.",

The complementary result for the X-chromosome follows, either a double or a single X.

Often only the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not preclude overlap in distributions. For example, most males are taller and stronger than females, but an individual female could be taller and stronger than an individual male.

In general, Males are more athletic and women (I'm not saying all women are weaker than men, I'm just saying when it comes to the top tier athletes in the world, male athletes are better). This is pure biology, and it is something that you simply cannot dispute. This results in men's sports being more popular than women's, due to the fact that they are the best in the world. Men's sports have a much bigger following than women's. Again, this is not sexist, this is just biology. Men's sports have higher viewership and make more money for television companies. This results in them being paid more than their female counterparts.",

I'd just like to point that out as a swimmer and as a person that watched basically the entirety of Olympic swimming. Can we also talk about how <b> sexism </b>affects men in sport as well? Men and women are \"typed\" into sports based on the social perceptions of the sports as being either innately masculine, feminine, or both. Why is it that the female gymnasts are getting more coverage and Spotlight than the males? Why is it that male boxers get more spotlight than women? It's because society dictates and pressures that a man should do a sport that portrays him as masculine while females must portray a feminine image. I want VOX to look at all issues, not just bullshit ones that random sexists and uninformed people say. I expected better and more informed content from this channel when I subscribed to it.",

And then down here in the comment section some of you (mostly males) are arguing and ridiculing women for \"complaining too much\".

Now\u00a0it is claimed that we always should use both version if we speak of the profession more generally to be more inclusive while people used to default to the masculine version when speaking of the profession in a more general way but they also included women with this term e.g. when they were asked to name their favourite writers (masculine) they\u00a0almost always also\u00a0mentioned female authors even though they were not technically included by the masculine version of the word. \n\nThe point being: Words have the meaning society gives to them and must not be defined by their origin e.g. the word peculiar in English comes from the Latin word for money. \n\nThis it is not automatically a bad thing if we use the term girl more often to describe women than boy to describe men.\n\nI am laughing at this video so I don't have to cry tbh.\nIt is in a certain way disgusting how much dishonesty is in this video FOX and VOX get more similar with every Liz Plank video.",

The fact that you guys, over at Vox, feel it's important to shame what is a minor occurrence instead of say, celebrating the female athletes or applauding the fact that Saudi Arabia sent female athletes to the Olympics for the first time, proves that you guys don't really care about news.\n\nInstead of finding some type grounded commentary  that can be made about what is happening and NOT MESSAGING THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION TO FIT YOUR ASININE AGENDAS, you managed to make a video where the first haft wastes the viewers time and the second half just insults the viewers intelligence. \n\nGood going Vox. You continue to find new and exciting ways alienate your viewers.",

Its amazing how far you had to reach to make this a \"report on<b>  sexism</b>\" lol. I do love though that Feminist will sit around doing whatever feminist do and sit and judge people when they are supposed to be for equality for all! its cool to think there is a organization that sits around and says humm the world is boring let's add some color to it and complain about any and everything men do and while we are at it let's drink from cups that say \"Men's Tears\" and go to men's meetings where the discussion is about suicide and domestic violence and let's beg and troll them to kill themselves. lol Epic!

Of course he's responsible for her success, he's here coach and husband. Before she met him, she was doing poorly, and he gave her motivation to keep trying.\n\nThis one, it's just that she isn't a well known athlete, and she is connected to one. \nIf Katie Ledeckys uncle won something, the headline would most likely be \"The famous swimmer,  Katie Ledecky, has a uncle who has won bronze on a world podium.\"\n\nThis one is more or less correct. He could have meant in the male division, or he just simply didn't know.\n\nAnother idiotic one, obviously people want to know about Micheal Phelps more than -",

            "commentText": "I don't follow the other sports so I don't know the full context, but I feel like the tennis examples don't really work. Bouchard in particular is a pretty bad example. She went from being a top ten player to barely top 50 and has been focusing entirely on marketing. Despite being far better than many of her opponents, she barely won a match in 2015 and she hasn't been doing much better in 2016. Despite her lack of success, she has found time to appear in numerous adds and product placements. When it comes to marketing in women's tennis, being young and attractive is unfortunately more important than being successful (which is also why Sharapova made more money than Serena before she was banned for doping).  As far as the comment about Murray being the first tennis player to win to Olympic gold medals, this seems to be more discrimination against doubles than against women's tennis. Doubles tennis is never treated with the same respect as singles regardless of <b> gender.</b> I think this is unfortunate since doubles players work just as hard as singles players but singles has more viewership and doubles is almost always forgotten. I assume the commentator would have clarified he was talking about mens tennis if either of the Williams sisters had a second singles medal. I'm not denying that there is<b>  sexism</b> in Olympics coverage, and the other examples given do seem sexist to me (although I don't know the full context), but I feel like the two tennis examples don't show any obviou<b> s sexis</b>m and they don't beling in this video.",

Men (in general) are bigger, stronger and faster. So, If you want to watch the BEST, you watch men. You watch women if you want more entertainment.  Women's tennis is far more entertaining, not for the manda4tory short skirts but because women have less strength and the rallies are able to go on longer. This makes the game more exciting. An ACE is a potentially perfect serve but its a fairly boring play. A true feminist would prefer to challenge the best at their sport even if it were a man. If a <b> woman </b>excels in her sport there is always the potential she could play with men but if a man does not make the cut he can not settle to compete with women...  seems like there is indeed<b>  sexism</b> but from which side is a discussion.",

The mere fact that you think you can judge how women feel, not only that - but ALL women - regardless on what evidence you're basing this on (for indeed no such evidence could possibly exist) speaks of a problem that is in a way at least related to the overall problem of discrimination against women, whether it be here in the West, or in other places. Comparing different kinds and degrees of discrimination does not help. Neither does denying that there is a problem. Don't get me wrong, friend, I also cringe and wince at ultra feminists, or the so called femi-nazis, who hyperbolize otherwise inadequate problems; but, to suggest that there is NO discrimination, even if it is a milder form of discrimination, left in the West, to me is absolutely absurd. There has been progress, true, but<b>  nobody</b> in their right mind would expect a mere century to heal all previous indiscretions (unless, of course, you don't think there were any indiscretions to begin with?) My stance, as a male, white (ish), lower middle class person is merely this: I listen to people when they talk about their problems - I don't dismiss them. I do dismiss the fringe arguments who are doing more damage to their cause as opposed to helping it (i.e. ultra feminists) but I listen to those in the middle who don't act all victimised and like society owes them anything, in fact they just state what THEY PERCEIVE the problem to be. \"They perceive\" being key here, since if something affects their perception to such an extent as to awaken any sort of mutually-felt discomfort in a pattern-like manner then maybe, just maybe, there is a problem there? Maybe not a problem as \"big\" as the problems women have in other parts of the world, but comparing the two is like saying: \"Those holocaust survivors hav<b> e nothin</b>g to moan about, people have been, and continue to die in much bigger numbers in total, so it's not a big deal\" - yes it is, and yes it was, regardless of all other pain and suffering there may have, or indeed may still exist, the two are not mutually exclusive. Do you get my point? Sorry if I offended, was not my intention to do so, in fact I think your argument is well structured and based on truth. I just don't see how that excludes problems of women here.",

E.g. \"Go back to the kitchen and <b> make me a sandwich\"</b> doesn't mean \"You're just a<b>  woman</b>, you belong in the kitchen\".\nI understand why it would seem like that, I understand why outsiders cannot see how it could be funny, and I'm sure some people writing it actually means it. But that describes all insider jokes and I'm also sure most people writing it doesn't feel that way.\n\nAlso, generally the feeling of being disconnected from people you write to releases restraints on people. They can tell the world their opinion, even if they'd never tell it to your face.\nThe way I see it:\n- research on popular opinions based on internet comments will over represent more aggressive opinions.\n- research on popular opinions based on real life surveys will over represent more look-at-me-I'm-such-a-good-person opinions.\nThis may or may not actually be true. Just my own general prejudice towards either.",

I had seen two instances of <b> sexism </b>like the newspaper article headlining Phelps' silver, but it's pretty disgusting to see this many examples in such a short period of time. This video gave solid examples of the<b>  sexism</b> I very often hear about but don't see as a male daily. I think the style of this video was the best way to go about it as well. Showing what's so wrong with society by pretending these are normal. I think you would have gotten even more criticism of you did this in a very serious tone. Another great video from Vox!",

I agree that many of the comments made by olympic commentators definitely had sexist tones and this is an important issue not just for the female athletes, but for women everywhere.

Again, the underlying message is valid and worthy of discussion, but it would have been better if Vox had adopted a more serious demeanour to present such an issue.",

The tennis player comment is because she was on a losing streak and he suggested maybe she is in it more for the endorsements instead of winning tennis matches.....this wouldn't be the first time a female OR male athlete has been accused of that. The twirl from the Australian commentator was stupid, I'll give you that one.\n\n2.The gymnasts comment was about their $2500 uniforms, not about them....Nice try, though.\n\n3. Hosszu's husband took over as her swimming coach after her swimming career was plateaued with her former coach. Thus he is responsible for turning her career around. It's called coaching, would you not have had a problem with it if she was a <b> lesbian </b>and her wife was her coach and turned her career around?\n\n\u00a04. The Chicago Tribune covers a professional football team named the Chicago Bears, maybe you've heard of em. Cogdell is NOT a native of Chicago, as she is from Alaska. Here is the<b>  CRAZY</b> part....CLICK THE LINK....OMG, what is the title of the article....? \"Corey Cogdell, wife of Bears lineman Mitch Unrein, wins bronze in Rio\" \n\n5. Both Venus and Serena each only have ONE Gold Medal in Tennis singles. There Gold's have mostly come in doubles. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Andy Murray played singles.\n\n6.

Not to mention that Phelps almost never gets Bronze or Silver, and this particular time he not only got a Silver, but had a 3-way tie, including with long time rival and friend, Chad le Clos.

The tennis player comment is because she was on a losing streak and he suggested maybe she is in it more for the endorsements instead of winning tennis matches.....this wouldn't be the first time a female OR male athlete has been accused of that. The twirl from the Australian commentator was stupid, I'll give you that one.\n\n2.The gymnasts comment was about their $2500 uniforms, not about them....Nice try, though.\n\n3. Hosszu's husband took over as her swimming coach after her swimming career was plateaued with her former coach. Thus he is responsible for turning her career around. It's called coaching, would you not have had a problem with it if she was a <b> lesbian </b>and her wife was her coach and turned her career around?\n\n\u00a04. The Chicago Tribune covers a professional football team named the Chicago Bears, maybe you've heard of em. Cogdell is NOT a native of Chicago, as she is from Alaska. Here is the<b>  CRAZY</b> part....CLICK THE LINK....OMG, what is the title of the article....? \"Corey Cogdell, wife of Bears lineman Mitch Unrein, wins bronze in Rio\" \n\n5. Both Venus and Serena each only have ONE Gold Medal in Tennis singles. There Gold's have mostly come in doubles. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Andy Murray played singles.\n\n6.

So to all the feminists of the world who see <b> sexism </b>in everything, let's make this happen. We should have equality in sports and not have women versus women and men versus men, but instead have unity. Once we have equality in sports it will start a chain reaction causing an end to all<b>  sexism</b>. Males and females are equal and should compete equally. Am I right?",

The twirl from the Australian commentator was stupid, I'll give you that one.\n\n2.The gymnasts comment was about their $2500 uniforms, not about them....Nice try, though.\n\n3. Hosszu's husband took over as her swimming coach after her swimming career was plateaued with her former coach. Thus he is responsible for turning her career around. It's called coaching, would you not have had a problem with it if she was a <b> lesbian </b>and her wife was her coach and turned her career around?\n\n\u00a04.

Here is the<b>  CRAZY</b> part....CLICK THE LINK....OMG, what is the title of the article....? \"Corey Cogdell, wife of Bears lineman Mitch Unrein, wins bronze in Rio\" \n\n5. Both Venus and Serena each only have ONE Gold Medal in Tennis singles. There Gold's have mostly come in doubles. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Andy Murray played singles.\n\n6. While Katie Ledecky is going to be very close, if not surpass Phelps medal count when her Olympic career is over.

The tennis player comment is because she was on a losing streak and he suggested maybe she is in it more for the endorsements instead of winning tennis matches.....this wouldn't be the first time a female OR male athlete has been accused of that. The twirl from the Australian commentator was stupid, I'll give you that one.\n\n2.The gymnasts comment was about their $2500 uniforms, not about them....Nice try, though.\n\n3. Hosszu's husband took over as her swimming coach after her swimming career was plateaued with her former coach. Thus he is responsible for turning her career around. It's called coaching, would you not have had a problem with it if she was a <b> lesbian </b>and her wife was her coach and turned her career around?\n\n\u00a04. The Chicago Tribune covers a professional football team named the Chicago Bears, maybe you've heard of em. Cogdell is NOT a native of Chicago, as she is from Alaska. Here is the<b>  CRAZY</b> part....CLICK THE LINK....OMG, what is the title of the article....? \"Corey Cogdell, wife of Bears lineman Mitch Unrein, wins bronze in Rio\" \n\n5. Both Venus and Serena each only have ONE Gold Medal in Tennis singles. There Gold's have mostly come in doubles. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Andy Murray played singles.\n\n6. While Katie Ledecky is going to be very close, if not surpass Phelps medal count when her Olympic career is over. Michael Phelps IS and WAS the worldwide star of the Olympics since 2008, why would he NOT be the headline, ever?\n\n7. This literally ha<b> s ZER</b>O to do wi<b> th sexi</b>sm and 100% to do w<b> ith rac</b>ism.\n\nWell, I think you and Liz are the problem and the cause why Feminism as it is practiced by feminists is awful.",

The tennis player comment is because she was on a losing streak and he suggested maybe she is in it more for the endorsements instead of winning tennis matches.....this wouldn't be the first time a female OR male athlete has been accused of that. The twirl from the Australian commentator was stupid, I'll give you that one.\n\n2.The gymnasts comment was about their $2500 uniforms, not about them....Nice try, though.\n\n3. Hosszu's husband took over as her swimming coach after her swimming career was plateaued with her former coach. Thus he is responsible for turning her career around. It's called coaching, would you not have had a problem with it if she was a <b> lesbian </b>and her wife was her coach and turned her career around?\n\n\u00a04. The Chicago Tribune covers a professional football team named the Chicago Bears, maybe you've heard of em. Cogdell is NOT a native of Chicago, as she is from Alaska. Here is the<b>  CRAZY</b> part....CLICK THE LINK....OMG, what is the title of the article....? \"Corey Cogdell, wife of Bears lineman Mitch Unrein, wins bronze in Rio\" \n\n5. Both Venus and Serena each only have ONE Gold Medal in Tennis singles. There Gold's have mostly come in doubles. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Andy Murray played singles.\n\n6. While Katie Ledecky is going to be very close, if not surpass Phelps medal count when her Olympic career is over. Michael Phelps IS and WAS the worldwide star of the Olympics since 2008, why would he NOT be the headline, ever?\n\n7.

Often the hijab is worn to guard a woman's modesty, and to keep her beauty hidden from those who want to exploit it.\n\nBut, that's not to say that some women are also forced to unwillingly wear the hijab out of their will, which in my opinion is only driving the women away from the hijab and/or Islam.\n\nThanks for your comment, but I would respectfully disagree. \n\nHave a great day!",

The commentator said the teenage girls on the USA gymnastics team may as well have been standing in a mall because he was commenting on how calm they were and didn't seem to be bothered by the magnitude of the event. \n\n2. With the tennis player who won two gold singles medals, it was implied that it was for men's. A <b> woman </b>doing the same is irrelevant. TV coverage does the same thing the other way around too to make people more interested; just last night, after the women's 400m hurdles, the commentators were saying how the American who won was the first American to win gold in the 400m hurdles - an American man had already got gold in the 400m hurdles, but that was irrelevant because it was a different event. \n\n3. Phelps winning the silver was the headline because everyone wants to hear about Phelps. Ledecky (did I spell her name right?) is a great swimmer and had an impressive swim, but Phelps has so much fame",

The tennis player comment is because she was on a losing streak and he suggested maybe she is in it more for the endorsements instead of winning tennis matches.....this wouldn't be the first time a female OR male athlete has been accused of that. The twirl from the Australian commentator was stupid, I'll give you that one.\n\n2.The gymnasts comment was about their $2500 uniforms, not about them....Nice try, though.\n\n3. Hosszu's husband took over as her swimming coach after her swimming career was plateaued with her former coach. Thus he is responsible for turning her career around. It's called coaching, would you not have had a problem with it if she was a <b> lesbian </b>and her wife was her coach and turned her career around?\n\n\u00a04. The Chicago Tribune covers a professional football team named the Chicago Bears, maybe you've heard of em. Cogdell is NOT a native of Chicago, as she is from Alaska. Here is the<b>  CRAZY</b> part....CLICK THE LINK....OMG, what is the title of the article....? \"Corey Cogdell, wife of Bears lineman Mitch Unrein, wins bronze in Rio\" \n\n5. Both Venus and Serena each only have ONE Gold Medal in Tennis singles. There Gold's have mostly come in doubles. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Andy Murray played singles.\n\n6. While Katie Ledecky is going to be very close, if not surpass Phelps medal count when her Olympic career is over. Michael Phelps IS and WAS the worldwide star of the Olympics since 2008, why would he NOT be the headline, ever?\n\n7.

Sure not all of them may fit the demograhpic of a young white male, but there's still a lot of people close to that description commenting sexist things on here. A lot of the time you can just tell by their profile picture. And, priveledged young white males are the most likely to say these things for a few reasons. One, due to their social standing they are priveleged to not experience the harrasment and discrimination that many other do, and so they don't understand it. Two, whether or not they know or accept it, white males benifit from the systematic <b> racism </b>and<b>  sexism</b> that is prevalent in every society to varying degrees.",

Hosszu's husband took over as her swimming coach after her swimming career was plateaued with her former coach. Thus he is responsible for turning her career around. It's called coaching, would you not have had a problem with it if she was a <b> lesbian </b>and her wife was her coach and turned her career around?\n\n\u00a04.

Both Venus and Serena each only have ONE Gold Medal in Tennis singles. There Gold's have mostly come in doubles. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Andy Murray played singles.\n\n6.

Can you provide me with a source for this one in regards to male athletes being accused of being more in it more for the endorsements? Also if the tennis player was in it more for the endorsements then she wouldn't be doing the Olympics, because you get better and more lucrative endorsements by winning. \n\n2.  I actually believe it was more about their composure rather than the uniforms, but I can't find a clip for complete context.\n\n3. I agree on this one.\n\n4. It was identifying her solely as a wife sans even her name that makes it sexist. And most people aren't going to click that link, they could of fit her name in there.\n\n5. This would be true IF the guy had said singles but he didn't.\n\n6. Katie Ledecky is actually very well known and when reporting on the Olympics, a gold should be the headline BUT I will say this was probably more about Phelps being famous rather than <b> sexism.</b>\n\n7. Also agree.\n\nSo like I said some good points and a few where I think you're stretching it.",

The only reason that men and women compete separately is because female athletes can't compete with male ones. Sure, female athletes are still impressivly good, but not enough to even qualify for men's competitions. So it's only natural that audiences see women's competitions as second rate and coverage simply reflects that. \n\nAlso, the Buzzfeed-esque satirical style was quite annoying and makes the unsubscribe button look tempting.",

She is the current world-record  holder in the women's 400-, 800-, and 1,500-meter freestyle (long course). She also holds the fastest times in the 500-, 800-, 1000-, and 1,650-yard freestyle events. In her international debut at the 2012 London Olympic Games as a 15-year-old upstart, Ledecky unexpectedly won the gold medal in the women's 800-meter freestyle in the second fastest performance ever. In total, she has won 20 medals, 19 golds and one silver, in major international competitions, spanning the Summer Olympics, the World Championships, and the Pan Pacific Championships. During her career, she has broken thirteen world records. Ledecky's seven individual gold medals at the World Aquatics Championships is a record in women's swimming. Her combined individual titles at the Olympics and World Aquatics Championships are a record for female swimmers.\n\u00a0Ledecky's success has earned her Swimming World's World Swimmer of the Year and the American Swimmer of the Year awards in 2013, 2014 and 2015, as well as the FINA Swimmer of the Year Award in 2013. Ledecky was also named the international female Champion of Champions by L'\u00c9quipe in 2014. She was named USOC SportsWoman of the Year: 2012\u201313. In 2016, Ledecky was the youngest person on Time magazine's Time 100 list.\nI could go on, but the point is that she is to women's swimming what Phelps is to men's and is worth similar note.",

And I believe no athlete plays a sport so that men in the media can accept them or publish more stories about them. Like for example the tweet of the Chicago newspaper. It wont affect her reputation if they mention her name in some tweet, she already won a medal in the Olympic which is astonishing, and I do not think she cares, she is happy that she won, who cares if the mention her name in a tweet. The case of Genie Bouchard, the comment the reporter made it is truly sexist and very disrespectful, and it is also a direct comment or attack to a <b> woman.</b> In those thing we should focus about and rant about, everyone, women and men. Nevertheless we should not pay attention to some tweet someone made without thinking twice about what he was going to publish. We have to remember that most media outlets (including this one) just want to attract some attention in order to gain revenue, and men in sports are bigger that <b>  woman</b> in sports (fact), although both should have the same attention the reality is different. That is why maybe some media cover first men sports. I do not think the intention of covering men sports first is to disrespect women. In conclusion we should focus more on the things that really matter, like social, political and economical matters, women and men should fight for equality, but by complaning about why a tweet did not have the name of th<b> e woma</b>n that won a medal is ju<b> st du</b>mb and it is getting offended <b> for noth</b>ing.",

The twirl from the Australian commentator was stupid, I'll give you that one.\n\n2.The gymnasts comment was about their $2500 uniforms, not about them....Nice try, though.\n\n3. Hosszu's husband took over as her swimming coach after her swimming career was plateaued with her former coach. Thus he is responsible for turning her career around. It's called coaching, would you not have had a problem with it if she was a <b> lesbian </b>and her wife was her coach and turned her career around?\n\n\u00a04.

Both Venus and Serena each only have ONE Gold Medal in Tennis singles. There Gold's have mostly come in doubles. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Andy Murray played singles.\n\n6.

The twirl from the Australian commentator was stupid, I'll give you that one.\n\n2.The gymnasts comment was about their $2500 uniforms, not about them....Nice try, though.\n\n3. Hosszu's husband took over as her swimming coach after her swimming career was plateaued with her former coach. Thus he is responsible for turning her career around. It's called coaching, would you not have had a problem with it if she was a <b> lesbian </b>and her wife was her coach and turned her career around?\n\n 4. The Chicago Tribune covers a professional football team named the Chicago Bears, maybe you've heard of em. Cogdell is NOT a native of Chicago, as she is from Alaska. Here is the<b>  CRAZY</b> part....CLICK THE LINK....OMG, what is the title of the article....? \"Corey Cogdell, wife of Bears lineman Mitch Unrein, wins bronze in Rio\" \n\n5. Both Venus and Serena each only have ONE Gold Medal in Tennis singles. There Gold's have mostly come in doubles. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Andy Murray played singles.\n\n6. While Katie Ledecky is going to be very close, if not surpass Phelps medal count when her Olympic career is over. Michael Phelps IS and WAS the worldwide star of the Olympics since 2008, why would he NOT be the headline, ever?\n\n7.

Literally everything that was said in this video were clips cut and taken out of context to make ignorant people like yourself, foam at the mouth and do what all people do anymore, and that's get offended. I simply stated why each thing she said was completely incorrect, that of which you cannot deny because facts are facts. If you connect <b> racism </b>with<b>  sexism</b> as if they are the same, you have no idea how the world works and should crawl back under the rock you live under, and stay put.\n\nMaybe you should really research your argument because you're extremely inaccurate and probably get your news from your Facebook feed. Hosszu is ON RECORD saying her husband turned her career around. Why in your feeble little mind does that take away from her career? She left he<b> r ol</b>d coach, went to a better coach, and got better. Happens all the time in sports. Literally. All. The. Time. Why is this one case different, because her coach is her husband? You, Helen are taking away from her career by denying her the gratitude she deserves for recognizing there was a problem, correcting it, and thriving because of her decision. Facts are facts are facts are facts. You cannot deny a single thing I said because I researched it to make sure there were no errors. That way when idiots comment they further my point. Like you, hey thanks!\n\nSo, not how stupid are men. How stupid are YOU? The answer to that question is, pretty stupid.",

Why? Because Williams is an international sports icon. Putting her on the front page of your paper is simply going to  sell more copies than putting Ledecky on the front, no matter what record(s) she set. Its the same thing with Phelps. He's been a household name for YEARS, so people want to know how he did. It has <b> nothing </b>to do with him being a man, and everything to do with him being a living legend.",

Don't ignore everything this girl is saying and talk about the \"bad production of the video\" and so on instead.

The tennis player comment is because she was on a losing streak and he suggested maybe she is in it more for the endorsements instead of winning tennis matches.....this wouldn't be the first time a female OR male athlete has been accused of that. The twirl from the Australian commentator was stupid, I'll give you that one.\n\n2.The gymnasts comment was about their $2500 uniforms, not about them....Nice try, though.\n\n3. Hosszu's husband took over as her swimming coach after her swimming career was plateaued with her former coach. Thus he is responsible for turning her career around. It's called coaching, would you not have had a problem with it if she was a <b> lesbian </b>and her wife was her coach and turned her career around?\n\n\u00a04. The Chicago Tribune covers a professional football team named the Chicago Bears, maybe you've heard of em. Cogdell is NOT a native of Chicago, as she is from Alaska. Here is the<b>  CRAZY</b> part....CLICK THE LINK....OMG, what is the title of the article....? \"Corey Cogdell, wife of Bears lineman Mitch Unrein, wins bronze in Rio\" \n\n5. Both Venus and Serena each only have ONE Gold Medal in Tennis singles. There Gold's have mostly come in doubles. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Andy Murray played singles.\n\n6. While Katie Ledecky is going to be very close, if not surpass Phelps medal count when her Olympic career is over. Michael Phelps IS and WAS the worldwide star of the Olympics since 2008, why would he NOT be the headline, ever?\n\n7. This literally ha<b> s ZER</b>O to do wi<b> th sexi</b>sm and 100% to do w<b> ith rac</b>ism.\n\nIt's just dishonest misrepresentation the reporting is even worse than on late night TV shows...\n\nThis is exactly why many people consider feminism to be a bad word nowadays, this needs to stop.",

There are exceptions for these cases but most of the time it's like this. The reason why men are usually featured on the front page is because people think men's category in sports are a lot more interesting. Just look at the NBA compared to the WNBA. People like the NBA more due to the fact that they are at a completely different level from the WNBA.",

Who do they dump a cooler on when an NFL team wins the Superbowl? It isn't the Tight End. <b> Nobody </b>doubts that Hosszu is an outstanding athlete and she has a world record to prove it, but giving her husband credit for part of that success isn't<b>  sexism</b> when he deserves it.\n\nAlso, Phelps getting top billing for silver in that article probably has a lot more to do with his name recognition tha<b> n sexis</b>m.  A lot more people on the street are going to recognize Phelps than Ledecky, so if you're trying to sell newspapers, you put his name at the top. I guess Occam'z razor doesn't apply when you're trying to push an agenda.\n\nThis video is clearly pushing an agenda and honestly it isn't even doing it that well. The Olympics have been going for two weeks now and coverage has been going on for longer than that. You cherry picked a couple of articles (not even articles really, mostly clips and headlines taken out of context) and extrapolated that into proof of systemic and widespre<b> ad sexi</b>sm in sports journalism. I don't buy it.",

Absolutely <b> nothing!</b> And you assume that the fact that they're the two most popular sports are some how denigrating to women? Gymnastics is popular because it's a beautiful sport and female athletes tend to be more flexible than their male counterparts. In other sports the men's competitions are more popular bc men tend to be physically superior, i.e track & field, the worst olympic male track and field athlete would easily beat the best female track and field athlete.

The problem is, most of this video focuses on such little jabs when there are mountains of great issues for feminism to tackle. When you tackle an injustice as broad as women's equality in a sarcastic tone you leave yourself open for insult because it appears as if you have devalued your own argument. (I know tones are hard to place in text but the argument has lots of value, it is just would appear to be contrary)",

The guy doesn't in anyway criticize her <b> gender,</b> only her behavior.\n0:51 Although Eugenie Bouchard was fine with being asked to twirl and this might be just a joke, the fact that the interviewer seems to have asked the same question to other female athletes I'm gonna go ahead and say that it's a stupid question.<b>  Sexism</b>? Alright, maybe\u2026\n0:53 He's referring to thei<b> r ag</b>e not the<b> ir gend</b>er. Boys can hang around in malls too, right? I've seen that happen all the time. I think it's a fair comment. Gymnasts are often far too young and pushed too much by their parents. I'd rather see these girls hanging about in a mall. I think that's a healthier activity for girls of t<b> hat </b>age. Not sexist.\n1:11 He's not only her husband, but also her coach. A victory for an athlete is surely also an achievement for the coach. The commentator is only saying the man successfully coached his wife to become a better swimmer than she was. Not sexist.\n1:40 It's a tweet. This is the Chicago Tribune trying to put as many information as possible in 140 characters, resulting in poor headlining. I might be persuaded into thinking this was sexist if the name of the Bears' lineman was put in the tweet. Alas, this is not the case.\n1:55 Okay, he should have said the first man. It's still a record.\n2:43 Well, It seems like America is absolutely obsessed with Phelps. Him losing is quite a big deal. It's not like the man is celebrated in this story.\n3:05 Alright, this one might be sexist<b> . Or ra</b>cist. But to you that's all the same right?\n3:29 Hollywoodlife.com is a gossip website. What did you expect?\n3:32 This is an article that reports on a nonsense debate. A debate start<b> ed on </b>black twitter. So if this is sex<b> ist or </b>racist, this is not due to the media, but thanks to the African-American community.\n3:36 Sorry, what? Someone has to explain this to me. This is the media reporting on a debate <b> about </b>a woman speaking out against America. The fact that she wears a hijab relevant to the debate as becomes clear from the article. This is sexist how?\n4:15 I don't.\n\nConclusion; I am unimpressed. This is<b>  all th</b>e sexism you found at the Olympics? Come on Vox, do your worst!\nAlso it all doesn't matter.

How do you know if the reporter that asked about the record that two women beat wasn't simply ignorant? What if the hungarian dude was actually the one who introduced his wife to competitive swimming or something? So what if phelps' artile was higher? We don't know if the cause of this was <b> sexism </b>for sure. If it was, then you have to ascertain it somehow in the video, and not just try to apply a narrative that isn't self-contained within the incident. In regard to the phelps one, i'm pretty sure it's because phelps is revered as a competitor in the olympics and has an godlike record. In fact, you could argue that the fact that he got silver made the headline, because he was actually beat by someone in swimming.",

And in both cases there will be people that outright deny that there is such a thing as <b> sexism </b>in the world and/or trying to ridicule and belittle the problem.

A woman's look are considered to be attractive even if she is only average whereas this would never happen for a man. This ofc leads to the tendency that if someone\u00a0is good at something attention is paid to that and diverted from others things the person might be good at. So I guess the burden of women is to be considered attractive, whereas men are not.\u00a0\n\n\nI however agree that this is a thing women can suffer from but it ultimately stems from this very attitude: Women are generally considered attractive whereas men are not.",
