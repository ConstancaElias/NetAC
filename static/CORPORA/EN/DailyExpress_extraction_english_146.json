When Meghan married Harry, she said: I 'm going to hit the ground running! She said she wanted to continue to pursue her own ambitions, and she wants to \"modernise\" royalty and while not even in the line of succession, she wants to tell royalty what to do. And instead of not responding to criticism, she either has her friends leak her letter to her dad to the press or complains about how tough life is surrounded by children in one of the poor countries of the world !. When you reply to critics, they will reply again. It will become a boxing match you can't win and that only gets worse.That 's why royals keep quiet and get on with things.  Meghan is just running into the wall of her own statements and behaviour.What has this go to do with her being biracial ? ",
