By forty most have heard the lies and exaggerations of retail advertizing millions of times. One has experienced the failure of products to deliver on such promises thousands of times. \nIf the experienced consumer educated their children with the truth, there would be a steady decline in misguided purchasing. The child saves the day by being gifted with knowing everything. This assures wisdom will be gained from experience and their basements will pile up with misguided purchases.\nKen Bowd 70 years young.",

I've had a hard time distinguishing people for criteria other than character, action, and personal hygene (I've been a hiring manager for a hotel, it was surprisingly relevant).  I'm lucky to have the outlook I do as it's afforded me so many enriching connections, resounding conversations, and lasting friendships with people ranging from 12 to 92.  To see people as simply Humans, extend them courtesy and a standard measure of respect, then see who they are by word and action, THAT is to really see them.  Had a felony conviction in your 20's and been out for 30 years, fought to build a mechanic shop through many prejudices/difficulties, and your favorite thing is baking - I want to hear your story and chat about life!\nI'd be truly sorry to miss out on that.  Until I see a person is either unapproachable, uninterested, or unable to converse I'm glad of any opportunity to connect... because we're all in this together and it's later than we think.",

But first of all, this video has a serious flaw: what exactly is \"<b> old </b>people?\" Quite frankly, no one can deny the huge difference between a 65 years<b>  old</b> person and a 95 year<b> s ol</b>d one, therefore, wouldn't it be inappropriate - and quite condescending - to group them under the same category in the first place? Take my grandma for example. When she was 65, she was really strong and healthy and could take care the house in a way that no one else could in my family. But now, when she is in her 90s, not only it is already difficult for her just to stay awake, but mentally she has lost the sharpness she had at 65 and has become agonizingly stubborn. \n\n\nSo really, this video asks and answers a wrong question in the first place. Especially nowadays the average life span has become so ...<b> ..\"o</b>ld?\" that it is not uncommon for people to live nearly a third of their lives <b> as \"</b>old persons\" while the society is changing ever so quickly t<b> hat </b>\"old experience\" becomes obsolete in just a couple decades in many cases.\n\n\nAging is a gradual process.

If we interact with an older person who is fully cognitive and has agency then we would treat them as such, but there are lots older folk that do need extra care due to AGING- something we all understand- so we are more sympathetic and more endearing. We also do act like this toward our sick (out of COMPASSION IMO), does that mean we are sickist too?",

Since our health system is based on a business model and not a wellness model, it's no wonder that someone knows at least a few if not several of the same type of older people that you've described. It is also due to how one is socialized, what their belief system is and lifestyle choices. We are not encouraged to properly take care of ourselves in the U.S. We are encouraged to buy products and take drugs. Therefore, no wonder our older population seems diminished in their health.

            "commentText": "The sad truth is that most of over pessimistic people that think bitcoin will bottom on $3000 or lower, $1000, or even <b> zero </b>should check themselves out of fairy tale story.. The bear market is beginning to end cos it is already exceeding the longest bear market in history. Time to accumulate cheap btc before it is too late, but what happens if it keeps skyrocketing to maybe its new all time high? That will be really great for an hodler. What if it falls again in a false bull run? The losers would be those holding coins and the winners would be the profiting trader because with his initial portfolio, he would have turned over profit maybe even as high as 400% and that is what investment is actually all about, making profit. There is somewhat a bullish sign but its not good enough to place a bet on. The most favorable approach is to buy more coins now and then, find a way to multiply your holdings so eventually when the bulls become stronger, we would have amassed a fair amount of bitcoins. Using this approach has been great for me because it has helped me avoid unnecessary expenses as i channel a certain percent of my earnings to trading and consequently,increasing my holding base in cryptocurrency. Something i have done that has really made a big difference in my crypto investment is trading with the system of a far more experienced trader with great success history. Mr Phillipp Krause introduced me to his system that has helped me triple my portfolio in just a couple of weeks. I have 11btc in my wallet and he is in a better position to assist you in creating a plan and working to achieve it like he did for me when i first met him. Contact is PhillippkKrause@gmailcom or whatsApp him +15183519039  My personal experience with him and the markets generally is that it is much easier to earn consistently good returns by following the trading signals and strategy of a much better, successful trader",

No one can tell me that that is reasonable or necessary. And that it's not the cause of the opium crisis and many other problems, including the one you're raising... (  [LINK]  )\nYou have any problem? Try a drug! That'll make it better, for sure. It's time that psychology plays a bigger role in health care systems. And greed a smaller one.\n\nThe reasons for why older people tend to behave the way they do are obviously not explainable by one thing alone. Almost <b> nothing </b>is. But I think we underestimate the effects that people around us have on us. And we should start focussing more on psychology, manipulation, conditioning, status quo biases, stereotypes and so on instead of only physiology.\nBut great point, a good addition, especially if you consider what behavior the manufacturers of the drugs might expect from older people and that they might create drugs based on a set goal of outcomes. Haven't thought about that aspect enough, so far. Thanks.",

Baby is an <b> weird,</b> awkward choice to use for someone who's not your child or significant other. And it seems dated, like from the '70s: \"You've come a long way, baby.\" Same for darling too, actually. Seems very intimate, so I'm not sure why he's okay with dear and darling, but not the others. ? Is it a Southern US thing, \"How ya doin' today, darlin'?\" I suppose if it's a cultural thing and just said generally to people, it's no big deal. \n\nIf dear, honey, sweetie are used with a kind tone and intention, I have no problems with those nicknames. Certain people are affectionate in their speech and call lots of people sweetie. It's different when those names are used as a come-on to be more intimate with someone the speaker isn't close to, who may not feel comfortable with those pet names. Or used with a sarcastic, condescending, or passive-aggressive tone and intent. It's usually pretty clear by the message that the speaker/writer is using the names to hit on or to demean the other. But with an<b>  elderly</b> person, asking, \"Can I get you anything else, sweetie?\" seems like something a caregiver, server, nurse, etc would say with concern for the other person. I feel it's all about the tone, intent, and general personality of the speaker.",
