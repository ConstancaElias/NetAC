Which is a tool used to target 50000 women, who are then subject to doxxing, harassment and having their twitter accounts targeted. Because Aimee can only feel safe if women are targeted, abused, driven off twitter. The women Aimee targets are defined by feminism, ie discussing inequality they live, after EIGHT years of austerity targeting mothers. So Aimee Challoner targets women discussing austerity to drive them off twitter, targets 50000 because Aimee imagines the connection that exists in Aimees head because Aimee identifies as a<b>  woman</b> makes that normal behaviour. When assessing abusive behaviour it is important to remove the identity of the person from consideration. I didnt know targeting 500000 women to doxx and harass them and try to drive them out of the public sphere was womanhood. Cos its not. Its male pattern abusive behaviour and indicative of someone with a seriou<b> s menta</b>l illness who imagines connections to women that entitle them to stalk and harass them. Aimees projection about 'driving trans people into the closet' is projection because Aimee is primarily known for driving women off twitter because Aimee imagines a connection to them. Maybe you need to actually assess these peopel critically. Because Stonewall and [people like Aimee Challoner have attempted to conflate trans rights with the rights to stalk, abuse, harass and attempt to subordinate women, trans rights are jeapordised. The process of embedding trans rights into wider safeguarding and equality frameowrks should have been straightfoward but AFTER activists like Aimee Challoner stated this debate entitled them to demonstrate male patttern abusive behaviour, the GRC became worthless. Maybe the Metro needs to try some criti5",
