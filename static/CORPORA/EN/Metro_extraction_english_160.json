Aye, lest we forget that the threat of fascism is real and in our faces,\u2019 the post said.', '\u2018We stand in solidarity with our Muslim brothers and sisters and are disgusted at this, and the state of a society that breeds such hate.', '\u2018It\u2019s Holocaust Memorial Day in a few days time. Wake up.
