Also i say they because i don´t live there. But i just want some of you to now that there is a difference between a Jewish person and an Israeli that is against. Because not every Israeli is racist and not every jew agrees with what is going on there in Israel. I am 16 years old and i grew up in the Netherlands. So how u gone hate me for how some people are racist there in Israel. \n\n\nI wish for world peace and no racism. And that Arabs and Jews can live in peace together or maybe separate, what ever will work out the best. As long as there will be peace.",

Knowing that they are allowed to marry as much women they want as long as they have the cash which is obviously supported by their government to establish a Huge group later and also another thing that greatly contributed on their spread is how they prevent their women marry a different religion and if happens a man wants to marry her should convert!!! So that's the Math on how they take over States and Impose Shariah Law!! Somebody should stop this madness if they want Unity they should update their beliefs especially Racism against other religion! Your the ones spreading Inequality and stupidy in mankind!",

    "commentText": "What do you expect, they are taught to hate since birth, by Israel’s education ministers, the Nazi Mother of settlements and the Kings of ethnic cleansing. Violence on the rise? No. It has always been this way with Israelis. This is a total reflection of the American southern states where black Americans were strung up in trees while body parts were cut off, ears, nose, penis, baby feeding breasts, then beaten to death, all this with a rope, tight around their collective neck. All that for sport. It was a festive atmosphere. People took photos. They had a picnic. It’s called lynching. So, when Israelis who hang stolen children on crosses in their military bunkers for the purpose of breathing difficulty, this is called lynching. This is Moses shaking hands with Jim Crow. Moses the ethnic cleanser. The murderer of innocent babies. To Israel, the true sickness of the Middle East that you are, the perverse institutionalized murdering machine that you are, thieves in the night who kidnap children from their beds for the purpose of interrogation with German Shepherds on hand, killers with sniper rifles on top of their high temple walls, killing children from a thousand paces. There are American Jewish men and women with duel citizenships who also engage in the heinous sport. They should lose their U.S. citizenship to go live with the monsters that created them. It’s is worse then everyone is being told. Sad, half of all Americans and half of all Israelis are bringing pulled down into the bloody mud by these vicious rats. Israel and America must ripe out the institutionalized guts of fascist government who kill in our name if we are to continue existing in a civilized world.",

    "commentText": "The Zionists have always been the provokers of violence. Ahad Haam was a Russian Jew and Zionist proponent who visited Palestine in 1893. He was shocked by the way the early Zionist immigrants were treating the native Palestinians, and warned that this could cause conflict. Here's his writing from 125 years ago:  \"We must surely learn, from both our past and present history, how careful we must be not to provoke the anger of the native people by doing them wrong, how we should be cautious in our dealings with a foreign people among whom we returned to live, to handle these people with love and respect and, needless to say, with justice and good judgment. And what do our brothers do? Exactly the opposite! They were slaves in their Diasporas, and suddenly they find themselves with unlimited freedom, wild freedom that only a country like Turkey [the Ottoman Empire] can offer. This sudden change has planted despotic tendencies in their hearts, as always happens to former slaves ['eved ki yimlokh – when a slave becomes king – Proverbs 30:22]. They deal with the Arabs with hostility and cruelty, trespass unjustly, beat them shamefully for no sufficient reason, and even boast about their actions. There is no one to stop the flood and put an end to this despicable and dangerous tendency. Our brothers indeed were right when they said that the Arab only respects he who exhibits bravery and courage. But when these people feel that the law is on their rival's side and, even more so, if they are right to think their rival's actions are unjust and oppressive, then, even if they are silent and endlessly reserved, they keep their anger in their hearts. And these people will be revengeful like no other.\"",

Pitanje državnosti nije isto što i gradjansko pravo. Svi su oni u Izraelu gradjani Izraela bez obzira dali su arapi druzi i drugi i imaju ista gradjanska prava, ravnopravni su, bili i biće. Čemu tolika zbrka. Naravno da ne mogu  arapi u državi Izrael stvarati svoju nekakvu državu. Šta će im to i da mogu, ali ne mogu nebi mogli opstati. Ko je tako zlonameran napravio zbrku i podbunio narod. Svi imaju ista gradjanska prava što je najvažnije, a pitanje veroispovesti  je pitanje svakog pojedinca gde i kako će da se moli. Neznam dali se zna ali i prorok samuilo u Izraelu pre nekoliko hiljada godina stvorio je  po Božjo9m promislu ideju odvojenosti crkve od države. To su verske slobode koje danas postoje u svetu.Amen",

The talmud is a book based on the racial superiority of jews! some israelis are taught that gentiles hate jews because they're just dumb or rasicist, but generally you have to ask yourself why people hate jews lol. I can promise you it's not because you believe in god, or anything religious. 90% of it is for your actions and lack of accountability for those actions. Not to mention jews are blind to the rasicisim and crimes commited by other jews. Where as muslims feel ashamed and self conscious of what radicals have done in their image. Now if it's a jewish terrorist they'd usually get a shrine and jewish people will take a pilgrimage to see it.",

I'm an Atheist so I really don't have a dog in this fight but it would be nice to get some objective honesty here. The main point to make would be that Israel is a Jewish country and Muslims and Arabs are permitted to live there, how many Jews are allowed to live in Islamic countries? And if they were there how long would they stay alive? Israel has offered peace to the Palestinians 5 times in the last century and every time they have shut down, no compromise, no negotiations. Islam globally is a huge power, they control much of the world's oil, have anti-semitic and homophobic propaganda pumped out across the Middle-East and North Africa destroying communities and poisoning the minds of children but in the West they pose as this cringing minority whose feelings you might hurt and who deserve all the protection of any vulnerable minority group, all while slipping Sharia Law in under the table. There is a real modern day threat to free society, freedom of speech and the empowerment of women and I think we can all agree that its not Judaism.",

I am a Buddhist and we never have a religious war only one time. against the muslim Mughal who slaughter us in Afghanistan Pakistan north india. guess what? there only 1% Buddhist left there. if we are a minority muslim leave us alone but if we r a majority they do everything they can to make our numbers low. hindu had the same problem. when a muslim gets attack its from self defense of 1000yrs of war with your muslim brothers. I have no problem with liberal muslim but those hard hard extreme muslim who want everyone to be a muslim needs to be fed to the sharks",

        "commentText": "@liz Swedlund \n     Why don't you read the bible? Jesus called Jews the \"synagogue of Satan\". Jews are definitely Satanists. Israel has a Satanic hexagram on their flag for crying out loud. The hexagram, or Star of David as so called Jews call it today, was originally the \"Seal of Solomon\". According to Jewish tradition, Solomon used the seal to conjure demons. The word hex (curse) derives from the hexagram.      \n        It's also been called the Star of Moloch and it was used in the sacrificing of children. \n       Don't take my word for it. Just read your bible. \n       \"But ye have borne the TABERNACLE OF YOUR MOLOCH AND CHIUN your images, the STAR OF YOUR GOD, WHICH YE MADE TO YOURSELVES.\" (Amos 5:25-26)         \n      \"Yea, ye took up THE TABERNACLE OF MOLOCH, AND THE STAR OF YOUR GOD REMPHAN, figures which ye made to worship them...\" (Acts 7:42-43)        \n         These are the people the new testament calls the Synagogue of Satan.      \n        \"I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a SYNAGOGUE OF SATAN.\" (Revelation 2:9)       \n           \"I will make those who are of the SYNAGOGUE OF SATAN, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars—I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.\" (Revelation 3:9)       \n            Hex literally translates to \"six\". The hexagram numerically equals 666 (6 points, 6 triangles, 6-sided hexagon). The Seal of Solomon is the mark of the beast.\n       “Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is SIX HUNDRED THREESCORE AND SIX.\" (Rev. 13:18)    \n          “Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was SIX HUNDRED THREESCORE AND SIX talents of gold...” (1 Kings 10:14)      \n       Things will only get worse as the Synagogue of Satan grows more poweful. Their goal is white genocide. Their rabbis teach that their Messiah (the anti-christ) will only appear once the European people are conquered and enslaved. Don't believe me? Hear it in the Devil's own words.\n      \"The Jewish Messiah (Antichrist) will only appear once Edom, Europe/Christianity, is totally destroyed. So I ask you, is it good news that Islam invades Europe? It is excellent news! Islam is the broom of Israel.\" ~ Rabbi David Touitou of Chabad Lubavich\n        \"Christian\" zionists are literally aiding the Satanic destruction Christianity and the West.",

I am half Israeli but that is besides the point, born in the US, look at my username you moron lol. But i don't know where you are getting your biased news from, but I'm sure you are not aware of the fact that Israel contacted every palestinian home and called them to get out and seek shelter before their last bombing(a retaliation of an Palestinian attack), and I can't think of a more moral act of war. But you analyze any group of people and you will see terrible acts committed, how do you not in War? Hamas is perfectly fine with killing Jewish babies as well, but it is the Israelis that are monsters? And last time i checked it was the Arabs who started this war with an illegal invasion of land created legally by lawyers and not by generals with no bloodshed involved. if you understand the Jewish history maybe it will make sense why they are sometimes aggressors but most of the time it is in defense. If the Arab world would learn from Israel the whole area could be united and be a superpower but they would rather fight.",

Because in your eyes they are unclean? Ten commandment didnt say covet the uncleam neighbor's land. The promise land that was given is made out off brutality? Thou shall not kill.

US do the bidding of Israel we all know that.\n\nIt's not about defending Muslim or Islamic countries because Russia love Islam, it's because Russia got brain, that after Islamic countries in ME, next could be them. Russia realizes that US are eliminating the competition that's why they involved.\n\nAbout friend or not, you yourself know how we Muslim believe in our faith stronger than anybody else, in our Quran there are prophecy about the end times, we will ally with Rum, against the Jew (Zionist), Crusader, and some Munafiq, I don't know, even the scholars of us ain't sure what Rum is, but the proofs all point to the eastern Christian Orthodoxy. We can be friend just like US now ally the Germans and Japanese, so do us, allying the Russian bear, we have massive manpower and crude oil, they have technology..",

(all those nations r in bed with the usa, uk, france, and israel). all those nations r in with the sex trafficking organizations. to say all the middle easterns rape and do all that bad shit to foreigners is a lie. Its like me saying all israelis want a palestinian genoicide and to take over the middle east. its like me saying all americans r corrupt like its government and they simply want global hegomony. Only the rich and powerful r involved with the shit u described, same goes for all other nations around the world, including israel and america, their rich and powerful r involved in rape and aweful treatment of people they dont want. u needa realize that the media is out to make islam look as bad as possible. Tell me, theres been reports that israelis have raped and killed foreigners, r all israelis like that? No their not. Same in america, theres rapist and killers EVERYWHERE and some justify their raping by religion and some simply through crazt supermecist ideology. religion and peoples actions shouldnt be mixed together, if they r, guess what, jews r all terrorist because lehi and irgun(would go on to be the likud party in israel) were jewish terror groups that raped, killed, expelled, tortured and deceived the pasleinians, the british and many jews around the world.

The only battles Muslims have ever won was thousands of years ago when their over whelming numbers brought them victories. I lived among Muslims in the middle east and met some of the most wonderful , caring and loving people in the world .  That being stated, once the Quran got involved and the peer pressure amped up, these same people became beasts from hell.",

        "commentText": "Vatsala काली Jhaveri \n\nBut how close was India to attacking Kahuta in the 1980s? The first time India is believed to have considered such an attack is in 1981. The idea obviously originated from the daring Israeli attack of June 7, 1981, that destroyed the under-construction Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak. Eight F-16s of the Israeli Air Force flew more than 600 miles in the skies of three enemy nations to destroy the target and returned unscathed.\n\nIn their book, Deception: Pakistan, the United States and the Global Nuclear Conspiracy, Adrian Levy and Catherine Scott-Clark claim that Indian military officials secretly travelled to Israel in February 1983 to buy electronic warfare equipment to neutralise Kahuta’s air defences. Israel reportedly also provided India with technical details of the F-16 aircraft in exchange for Indians providing them some details about the MiG-23 aircraft. In mid- to late-1983, according to strategic affairs expert Bharat Karnad, Indira Gandhi asked the IAF once again to plan for an air strike on Kahuta.\n\nThe mission was cancelled after Pakistani nuclear scientist Munir Ahmed Khan met Indian Atomic Energy Commission chief-designate Raja Ramanna at an international meet in Vienna and threatened a retaliatory strike on Bhabha Atomic Research Centre at Trombay.\n\nThe next time India is believed to have seriously considered attacking Kahuta was in September-October 1984. Details of the Pakistani nuclear programme crossing the weaponisation enrichment threshold had then begun to emerge. As seen from documents declassified last week, on September 16, 1984, US Ambassador Dean Hinton told Zia that if the US were to see signs that India was preparing for an attack, they would notify Pakistan immediately.\n\nIt has also been rumoured that Israeli air force was part of the plans to attack Kahuta in 1984 because it did not want to see an “Islamic Bomb” developed by Pakistan. Israel was supposed to lead this attack and not merely play the role of advising the IAF. Bharat Karnad has written that Israeli aircraft were to be staged from Jamnagar airfield in Gujarat, refuel at a satellite airfield in North India and track the Himalayas to avoid early radar detection, but Indira Gandhi eventually vetoed the idea. Levy and Scott-Clark though claim that Indira Gandhi had signed off on the Israeli-led operation in March 1984 but backed off after the US state department warned India “the US will be responsive if India persists”.\n\nhttp://indianexpress.com/article/explained/in-fact-did-india-plan-a-covert-military-attack-on-a-pakistani-nuclear-reactor/",

Its idiotic to classify it as race issue. Two tribe in war over land and its also complicated by religious reasons. There is no racist motivation but simple animosity (from jewish side) developed in almost 100 yr of conflict.\nThird. I had hard time to dis-cipher:\n\"Don't you think they would live in Palestine if they support Hamas, and not support the Israeli government by living there and contributing to it?\"\nI guess you mean to say that Israeli Arabs would rather live in Palestinian state than in Israel...not really check this:\n\nhttp://www.newsweek.com/what-do-jerusalem-arabs-want-365434",

If you think Hamas only use Al-Qassam rockets you are deeply misinformed, they have advanced rockets as well, they are funded greatly by Qatar and other Arabic countries so don't make them out to be less than what they are.\n\n\nNonetheless, even if we take your side of the story, there is so much Israel can take and afford, the Iron Dome costs huge amounts of money and even though Israel is funded by the US and by itself is a generally rich country, it's still way too much money. Hamas just sends these rockets in huge amounts and there comes a time when they just have to wipe out all of the terrorists and their weapons.\n\n\nIf Israel wanted to wipe out Palestinians they would do it in 1 day, if there was actually \"ethnic cleansing\" going on as you anti-Israelis call it, their population wouldn't increase as much as it did and does till today. \n\n\nThat being said, Palestinians are a bunch of Arabs from different countries,  the area of modern \"Palestine\" was considered southern Syria, there was actually no national identity of \"Palestine\" nor Palestinians\", these are made up terms to fight Israel politically, physically as well.",

The rockets obviously aren't that big if they only cause a fraction of the death and destruction that the Israeli bombs cause.\n\nAre you seriously justifying killing thousands of people because Iron Dome is too expensive to keep running? Israel is one of the only Countries with their economy still in the green, if anyone can afford to keep the Iron Dome running it's Israel.\nPerhaps you could dismantle the illegal settlements and leave the occupied lands and Hamas wouldn't have a reason to shoot rockets at you...\n\nIf Israel wiped out the Palestinians they would be seen as the modern day version of Nazi Germany. I don't think there is ethnic cleansing going on at the moment, Israel just don't care about Palestinian lives.\n\nPfft, by that logic there are no Syrians either, when the Ottoman empire was destroyed and divided into Countries Palestine was one of the Countries that was created. Same as Syria, so how could the Palestinians really be Syrians? I have heard the same bable with Jordan, it's not a valid argument",

So some Palestinians try protecting themselves by threatening Israel.. Others by deserting to other countries, the point I'm trying to make here is that Palestinians can't just keep swearing at Israel, and Israel can't just keep bombing and killing children in Palestine! What's left for Palestinians? What's left for them? Israel have over a million of companies around the world and Palestinians... They have nothing! And if they have.. They'd barely have some, Israel is rich! They're all okay with their lives! But Palestinians... Most of them don't have passports! They can't travel! They don't work! They don't have money! So if we can just fix a problem here, we can do it by convincing Israel to stop bombing children in Palestine (not in Gaza but specifically Palestine!) like okay we get that u want the country but where's the logic? Let's just say they take over the country after its all destroyed! What's going to be left over! We didn't live to destroy people's lives! We didn't live to make wars! We didn't live to keep blaming Palestinians and Israeli people for our mistakes! Think of things before you take action! We want peace and that's all... Killing won't help! It would simply make it worse!! I maybe wrong but this is my opinion and I think It's the truth because this has been happening for centuries now and it still didn't stop!",

Usually what you get when talking about settlements to israeli is some holocaust card and for them to change the subject to terrorists. So you guys build illegal settlements for foreign settlers because of islamic terrorists? Or the holocaust.. seem legit.

Pharoah said to him: 'Moses, I can see that you are bewitched.' 'You know full well,' he [Moses] replied, 'that none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth has revealed these visible signs. Pharoah, you are doomed.'\"\n\n\"Pharoah sought to scare them [the Israelites] out of the land [of Israel]: but We [Allah] drowned him [Pharoah] together with all who were with him. Then We [Allah] said to the Israelites: 'Dwell in this land [the Land of Israel]. When the promise of the hereafter [End of Days] comes to be fulfilled, We [Allah] shall assemble you [the Israelites] all together [in the Land of Israel].\"\n\n\"We [Allah] have revealed the Qur'an with the truth, and with the truth it has come down. We have sent you [Muhammed] forth only to proclaim good news and to give warning.\"\n\n[Qur'an, \"Night Journey,\" chapter 17:100-104]\n\nFor your further education, Islam is 1600 years old and Judism is almonst 4000 years old.

Israel has used illegal bullets \"butterfly bullets\" which causes the bullets to get stuck in the limb and require amputation. Israel has awarded is military for killing innocence regardless if they are Christian or Muslim. Third Israel has committed a crime against America back in the USS liberty Incident where more than 200 people were injured/killed. Israel has killed more than 40k people since the occupation and has jailed multiple children below the teenage age. They misplace young kids in random places in cities where they are lost. \nDon't come here trying to replicate what the media already does. I think people deserve to know what Israel has done without being called anti-Semitic or racist for once. The funny thing is Arabs are also Semites and yet they are mistreated by the closest group in term of religion. Sad really.....",

    "commentText": "Both sides need to let go, forgive, but it will never occur. The violence is a cycle, of continuous, non-stop hatred. Israel is much more guiltier than the Palestinians who are no angels either, but no 'devil(s)/demon(s). They are both humans, both believe they are right, and deserve this land more, all on insane claims to the lands all based on Holiness, from their 'Holy' Books, in their ' Holy' land, of their 'Holy' Prophets, in a 'Holy' time many Millenniums ago. Israel will never allow them to have true peace, and let's be honest. They are the true aggressor, opposed to who's defending themselves, the Palestinians. Who went from 100 percent of the land, to 60/40, and then in 1967 to present day to where it gets worse where they are segregated as South Africa, or US in the 1900's and back. Palestinians are treated as foreigners on a land their ancestors lived in for centuries, millennium and a half or so.\n\nThe Jewish people were exiled from Israel/Palestine and thus were taught not to return to Israel until their Prophet returned. Who returned? Who is their Prophet that is back? I don't see him, other's do not, and will never see him, because there is no such thing. The recent conflict in Gaza, all you need to do is look at the death tolls, and who is dying. Israeli soldiers, compared to innocent Palestinian civilians such as women, children, elderly people, men, and soldiers (where Palestinians have a small army, compared to Israel they stand no chance. Weaponry such as democratically elected Hamas uses is nothing to that of the Israelis, so let's be realistic here. The Palestinian ones are afraid of a terrorist state, acting out terrorism on them, and are defending themselves, not causing the problems intentionally for no purpose besides terrorism. Not true, there is always a purpose and reasoning to every action, and two sides to every story.  Palestinians are not terrorists as many would love to claim, mostly Zionists, crypto-Jews (non-Semitic, yet call other's anti-Semites. Even if they were, what does that have to do with you? Hah! A joke.\n\nIgnorant people unfortunately fall for this crap), and innocents are victimized by the 'victims' physically and mentally. Also, all throughout the world, the US is hated because of it's policing of the world, and it will come back to bite them in the ass. Support for Israel will be the second one, as many Arabs stated they wouldn't hate America if they didn't support Israel killing Arabs, slaughtering them, in almost genocidal ways. Israel has how many Nukes? Yet won't admit that they do, and sign the treaty that every other Nuclear power has.\n\nThey hide behind victimhood, and the Holocaust, yet Holodomor the Ukrainian Genocide done by the USSR by Stalin, and Pol Pot in Cambodia, or Armenians by the Turkish, yet the Holocaust is covered every week or sooner, and Museums are everywhere. Where are the Museums everywhere for the other genocides? Not in the US for sure. That is why so many are geopolitically ignorant, geographically ignorant, and in a 'bubble' you may say. Dumb, but smart enough to do the jobs none of the higher-up, richer populace doesn't want to such as cleaning, Laundromat business, regular-medium sized businesses not corporations, and so on.",

Then what actually happened was WWll which I’m really sorry about what happened to the Jews, but they needed land and Britain was not giving them any. They asked to have some of Palestine in which they agreed, but like what happened with the Massachusetts colony, they started taking more and more land from the Arabs. It got bad when half the land was taken over. The Arabs tried to get there land back in a peaceful way like the native Americans in Massachusetts did, when they did not comply, like the native Americans, they wanted to fight back, but at that time it was too late, they had most of the Arab weapons and like the colony that Americans feel bad for taking over, Palestine gets taken over in 1948. We still turn a blind eye towards Arab because it doesn’t effect us in anyway. This is 7th and 8th grade history guys, come on.",

        "commentText": "@111newera Lets talk about what Dr.Elhaik really found... He never really claimed that ALL (or even MOST) European Jews are descendants of converted Khazars - Yet alone \"proved it\". His only claim is that the Khazar Empire was a transition point were Jews from all kinds of places (including Judea, Byzantine Empire, Iraq, Persia, and even Rome) met, mixed a bit with each other and with local Khazar population, and then continued to East and Central Europe - As on can see in his Fig 1:\n\nhttp://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/...\n\nHere are the real conclusions of this (silly) study - with a link too it:\n\n\"We conclude that the genome of European Jews is a tapestry of ancient populations including Judaized Khazars, Greco–Roman Jews, Mesopotamian Jews, and Judeans and that their population structure was formed in the Caucasus and the banks of the Volga with roots stretching to Canaan and the banks of the Jordan.\"\n\nhttp://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/...\n\nIt's true that he does claim at some point that: \"The Near Eastern–Caucasus ancestries are dominant among Central (38%) and Eastern (32%) European Jews followed by Western European ancestry (30%)\"; And also that: \"Although the Rhineland hypothesis explains the Middle Eastern ancestry by stating that Jews migrated from Palestine to Europe in the 7th century, it fails to explain the large Caucasus ancestry, which is nearly endemic to Caucasus populations\"... However, a quick look at his Fig 5 reviles that other Middle Eastern populations, like the Cypriots, Syrians and the Lebanese, got almost the same amount of \"Caucasus ancestry\" (~15% - 25%) and a much-much higher amount of \"Near-Eastern ancestry\" (that would probably be Turkic ancestry - which would make them closer to Khazars than the Ashkenazi Jews), and even some amount of \"Western European ancestry\" (10%-20%) - which altogether means that Askenazi Jews got most of their \"Caucasus ancestry\" and a bit of their \"Western European ancestry\" in their ancient homeland in the Middle East...\n\nHere you can see it all, in his Fig 5:\n\nhttp://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/...\n\n\nNow, the thing I like most about Eran Elhaik's study is the part were he tries to determine the \"biogeographical origin coordinates\" (i.e. where in the world thy most fit genetically today) of Eastern European and Central European Ashkenazi Jews by comparing their DNA to DNA of other populations who live today in different places of the world... To make a long story short, he comes up with all kinds of coordinates in the northern parts of the Middle East - not even close to Europe... For example: The smallest deviations in the geographical coordinates were obtained with Armenians for both Eastern (38 ± 2.7° N, 39.9 ± 0.4° E) and Central (35 ± 5° N, 39.7 ± 1.1° E) European Jews... Now try running those coordinates on Google Maps, and you'll find that the biogeographical centers of Eatern (38° N, 39.9° E) and Central (35° N, 39.7° E) European Jews, are just a bit to the north and a bit to the south of the line between Ur-Kashdim and Harran - which are mentioned in the Bible as the original homeland of Abraham:\n\nhttps://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&ms...\n\nFunny, isn't it?",

You claim to have studied history so you should know this then.\n\n\"I DID STUDY HISTORY, and I do know why indians have issues with islam, but there are a lot that hate muslims. period.\"\n\nYou just reinforced my point. Indians have historically justified reasons to dislike Islam, even out-right hate the ideology. So again, why are you complaining that Indians dislike Islam if you have studied history and understand where they are coming from? do people not have a right to oppose Islam at all?\n\n\"Islamophobia is quite existent… you're not the first person to refute the ideology of it, but it exists alright.\"\n\nI spent a good deal of effort explaining above why Islamophobia is not a useful term. You can call me anti-Islamic, go right ahead, it's a very fitting term to use - it's ACCURATE - Islamophobia however is just insultingly inaccurate, it makes it sound like anti-Islamic people have mental disorders. If your counter-argument to someone's criticism is that they are just mentally defective, you don't really have a counter-argument at all, you have an insult, and insults do not refute another person's claims, it only makes it seem like you have no real arguments to make.\n\nSTOP using the term.

You are basically arguing that the non-Islamic people are the ones' making things bad, not the ideology they oppose, and that they \"should join the rest of us in the 21st century\" - this is funny to me because non-Islamic people do live in the 21st century, where Atheism is rife due to the overwhelming evidence to explain things that was previously the domain of religions, and even other religions adapt to reflect the time we live in.\n\nExcept Islam. Islam refuses to adapt and evolve and insists on rules regualtions and ideals that were created over a thousand four hundred years ago - ergo it creates many problems, and anti-Islamic people don't like that - so they object.\n\nI am here the defame the premise of your arguments. It is up to you to either make good on your arguments that\n\n\"...quite frankly I don't have time to discuss things...\" \"...you're one person who's opinion doesn't mean jack shit to me…\"\n\nYet you are still here making long posts to defend your position and talk shit to me and others who disagree with you. How very mature and decent of you.\n\n\"Go ahead and hate islam, or feel dislike for it, just do it within your own privacy, instead of letting the world know about your overreactions and fear,\"\n\n\"I'm just sick of people like you who come here to proclaim that speaking out about a fear of islam is NOT islamophobia.\"\n\n\"I really don't care if you're mad, or fearful of islam, I'm not here to talk you into liking it, or seeing the beauty in it...\"\n\nYeah, I totally wasted my time trying to make you understand why \"Islamophobia\" is a poor term, didn't I? Seems to me you would rather keep believing that anyone that disagrees with \"the beauty of Islam\" - and you are TOTALLY not a Muslim at all - are just irrationally afraid and overreacting.\n\nReally.\n\nI commented above The Muslims made a nice lie about that, even: They call it \"Islamophobia.\"\n\nErgo, anyone that makes that claim says the people who speak out against Islam has an irrational fear and thus over-react. Any critics of Islam face this... so I guess the only fair-minded people are the one's that think Islam is perfectly fine?\n\nYou see the problem here? Now, why did I bring up Islamophobia? To disarm you for the next argument - I've argued with many pro-Islam people like you and it always ends with \"you just have a phobia against Islam\" and I'm tired of this excuse.\n\nSo damn ironic - I was right all along about what your response would be. You are JUST like all the other Islam-apologists that instantly jump on the \"you just have mental issues\" band-wagon to try and smear Anti-Islamic people, silence any criticism.\n\nOffer me any real argument in your next reply or this exchange is over and you will have lost all credibility.\n\nYou can start by explaining why Islam don't deserve the criticism that is laid at it's feet today.",

Hmmm maybe because some indian guy, judging by his name, made some racist and extremely offensive comments to me, and somehow here you are giving ME a fucking hard time. \n\nAs I said, go ahead and oppose islam, I don't care, as long as you're not a bigot, or violent, then whatever. \n\nPhobia means fear…. I don't care how you think it sounds, it is a fear of islam, and that's literally what the term means….. So what are you refuting exactly?\n\nYou're a hypocrite because the whole reason why you started this argument was to point out that I shouldn't be creating a fuss about this guy's comment and here you are claiming it's okay to be islamophobic and it's okay for indians to hate islam, then i guess it's okay for anti-semitism to exist according to your logic.\n\nEXCUSE ME. I did not say that non-islamic people are making things bad… wtf is wrong with you?? don't put words into my mouth. I'm not a fucking idiot. \n\nOnce again, i've heard your 7th century barbarism argument over and over… and well if that's what you think, then fine.. I have no further comment on this.\n\nWell your opinion doesn't mean anything to me.. you just told me you have reservations about islam and that's not my problem.\n\nYou did waste your time, unfortunately. I still believe such a thing as islamophobia exists….\n\nAnd no , it wasn't ironic.. YOU BROUGHT UP THE TOPIC OF ISLAMOPHOBIA IN ORDER TO GET A RISE OUT OF ME, OR A RESPONSE…. \n\nand I haven't lost a fucking shred of credibility, you're not the queen or king of england, or anyone who can tell me what kind of credibility I do, or do not have.\n\nYou're the one throwing insults and acting arrogant.\n\nI AM AGNOSTIC, i believe in science :) ..…. WHY SHOULD I TELL YOU WHY ISLAM DOESN'T OR DOES DESERVE CRITICISM…? WHY DONT I TELL YOU WHY CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM DESERVES CRITICISM OR NOT AS THAT IS SOMETHING I'M MORE QUALIFIED TO HAVE A RESPONSE ABOUT....",

Even after giving the Sinai back to Egypt and the Gaza to Hamas, their people still plot to destroy Israel and constantly commit these heinous acts.  \nOne recent example (on a larger scale) is the Iranian warheads that were intercepted on the way to Palestinian militants in the Gaza in early March. Their people complain about how Israel mistreats them, but Israel is the only democratic country that even considers their opinions! I'm not saying that the Jewish youth is correct in their actions, but their hatred is derived because of the Arabs' constant hateful and vicious actions. Not all Arabs and Palestinians are bad, but as a group, they need to change.",

Now I know racist Neo-Nazis like yourself support the \"Palestinians\" based on the racist anti-semitic coments I have seen in your channel but I mean please do the Palestinians a favor and do not support them because you give them a even worse image than of what they already have. Anyone who threatens another country should get ready to get punched out. It is so funny how Socialist cunts like yourself start \"caring\" for the Palestinians when you cunts did no different from the American Capitalists or as well all know Russia invading Afghanistan, killing Afghanis to invade them to control some oil nearby as well, or as you also did with Azerbaijan, so don't come here spreading your obsession with Americans when we know very well you Left Wing cunts are also using Arabs and the Muslim world for your own political interest as well. You are well known for robbing and committing atrocities no different from the others. FACT is you are the same shit and at least some Palestinians know the truth of why so much Socialists out of nowhere start caring for the \"Palestinian Cause\" when there are over 2.5 million people were getting killed and raped by Arabists and Islamists with Socialist countries supporting Al-Bashir for his human rights violations in Sudan while the Socialist world supported him and kept silent...Why? Because the Socialists will gain power and wealth by Sudan. Shame, shame, shame. Before judging America, judge yourselves first.",

When Russia, China and North Korea commit human rights violations or break international law..the majority of Socialist/Communist countries and organizations keep on supporting them if not some keep silent. Israel never had a perfect country when it was under Socialist rule, in fact there were more ethnic clashes between Arabs and Jews. Middle Eastern Jews were treated as second class citizens by this government and it is because of Conservative Governments like Netanyahu why Middle Eastern Jews are treated as first class citizens. There is also a reason is to why the majority of Mizrahi/Sephardic Jews are in general conservative. Communist men were already the evil men which is why Reagan seek to destroy them for them trying to invade other lands and mess with other countries and start war which indeed the communists succeeded in that. Thank God the Israeli State did not continue to be governed by Socialist War mongers and corrupt government run by the Russians. There is a reason as to why Socialists/Communists were even at war with each other because they each have different supremacist moved on how to start a war and overthrow governments.",

As I have said when North Korea bullied and til this day bullies South Korea the MAJORITY of Socialist countries AND ORGANIZATIONS support their act as \"just\" or some keep silent. When Socialism first came out it resulted in them starting wars, massacring people just to overthrow anything that they did not agree with. Today Socialist governments are one of the most corrupt out there. As I have said in Israel, the Socialist government discriminated against Middle Eastern Jews, their culture and took away certain rights. They also took the rights from the religious, took many Hasidic children and Religious Yemenite Jewish children, put them in homes to Secularize them...this was DONE by the Socialist government of Israel and everyone knows this very well. Today at least the Conservative gives rights to Jews of all background, color, religious sects, non-religious peoples while the Socialist focused on forcefully secularizing the entire nation. Socialism/Communism causes dictatorship and no freedom of speech. Again, I am not referring to Karl Max' Socialism rather I am referring to the Socialism after Karl Max that exists til this day and unfortunately 90% of it is corrupt which is why I do not support THIS type of Socialism that the majority of people follow til this day. England was good and bad with both Socialism and Conservative Governments. Thatcher and other Conservative governments gave wealth and good economy to Britain but it came out of other countries pockets. England was still not all that when it was under Socialist power, it had it's issues and it also gave the country some wealth and good economy but at the expense of other countries and people. What I am saying is that me and you have been agreeing that THIS type of Socialism is disgusting compared to the real and original one of Marx which unfortunately his ideas did not go as we expected it to go.",

Everyone hates your country even football star Christiano Ronaldo refuse to exchange jersey with your player during friendly match but Ronaldo raised the money from the sale of his Golden Boot through his club’s charity foundation which will dedicate the funds to schools in Gaza, Palestine following an auction. No wonder other countries have a lot of problem with this problem country that always causing chaos. We don't give a shit about you jews shithead. Admit it and face the reality that everyone hates you're people and you're fake country. I'm glad Israel is banned to come and visit to several countries especially muslim countries.

Right wing extremism involving arab bashing in the street has been a problem for us for quite sometime and that has NOTHING to do with our relationship with the americans, no matter which way it goes, its a problem of our own internal affaires. And I really dont need to hear  head in the clouds explanations from someone outside of israel about the roots of our problems.",

If you steal other people's land or help those who do, expect there to be consequences. If Israel hadn't created so many external enemies, Israelis would all kill themselves.

Hopefully the christian population will rise soon enough to prevent muslims and their socialist/communist allies from turning europe into sharia-ruled chaos. Civil war will break out. Its only a matter of time before people realise that multiculturalism isnt sustainable whenever and whereever islam is present",
