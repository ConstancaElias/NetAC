Almost every child experiences different types of segregation... coz of their social status, weight, disabilities, likes and dislikes. To break down the word segregation it's simply explained by its roots: jealousy, fear, ignorance, naivety... which simply means not to be emotionally mature.",

            "commentText": "Many of you are making comments ts about acceptance and generalizing about which groups are more accepting of mixed children. But I tell you, it really depends on the community and the individuals involved in each circumstance. \n\nI have observed that, in the US, being mixed makes one \"other\", but for most people it us a curiosity, or a relief because they believe it will be easier to identify with someone who is mixed than with someone from a different culture who MAY have a strong resentment to them based on race/cultural background. In Japan, it seems, being \"other\" is generally a bad thing.\n\nBut I have heard of half <b> black </b>children in the US being bullied and called names by their<b>  black</b> classmates and likewise from some of their white classmates. The lighter the mixed child, the more culturally \"white\" their peers tend to assume they should be. Though any mixture that is at all observed makes one \"not white\" and therefore<b>  \"blac</b>k\" or \"mexican\" or \"asian\", always being called by the identity of the mixed group instead of the white majority.\n\nIt is sad, but in the end it represents an important truth: we all want the same thing, to be accepted by our peers, and that results in the same fear of being rejected based on our immutable qualities. Sometimes that fear leads people to reject and mistreat others who are different on the basis of acceptance by the more homogeneous group, or because they are acting preemptively in self defense, despite the reality that they are acting as the aggressors.\n\nNo one is defined, ultimately, purely by the color of their skin, but rather by the way they acted and the way they spoke. I hope that this comment speaks to some of you on this thread and encourages you to challenge your assumptions every day, knowing that what we assume does not always represent what is true.",

The history reflects that, so I think Japan needs a reality check. That right there is the problem, people keep talking about \"pure Japanese\" when in fact modern Japanese arose from a mix of Koreans, Chinese, Ainu, Paleo Siberians, Ruuukyuu, possibly Southeast Asians and Micronesians, and other indigenous Asian Peoples. This idea of Japan being this homogenous society is a fucking joke. Get real. Let's tell the real truth, Japan had a problem because she was Half <b> Black </b>and relatively dark skinned. It's irritating when people sugarcoat, and tiptoe around the real issue.",

Countries that weren't influenced by the j\u20acws were, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Egypt, Syria, Iran. They don't use the same currency and the same banking. So the j\u20acws made up lies about them and got them attacked. It wasn't because of oil it was because of their banking. After attacking them they changed their banking and currency. You see a pattern? They can't attack japan though because Japan is stronger than the US and they know it. \nThese countries are against degeneracy like being <b> gay<b> ,</b</b>> changing genders, etc, banned porn, had their own banking, rich histories, kept the enemies out, and looked down on mixing.

There needs to be structure in the USE of words and their meaning! transwomen' arent women <b> nothing </b>has any meaning and you dumbsh8ts cheering it on, GREAT because this nonsense will touch down in your neck of the woods and see how happy you'll be when you're swearing left and right! Pretty soon people will say they have PSD from watching a war movie and will demand support and they'll get it but not the people who actually served! You can't pick and choose nonsense it will just get a green light across the board and you'll have your thumbs sooo far up your a$$es that it will smell like BS WHEN YOU TALK!  IT'S THEIR FREAKING COUNTRY YOU<b>  DUMB</b> FUCHS!",

I don't know just my opinion tho\n\nHere in japan it's hard to be half, atleast some half people are obviously half, I'm also half but I look so japanese that people don't think of me as half and my struggle here is that I didn't grew up  here don't really know much about the culture and don't even get me started about the language, and because I look like them even though I'm half they expect me to act like them or think like them, they even look at me like I'm <b> dumb </b>when I can say nihonggo properly, but when they start to know that I'm half they start acting strange and start treating me like I don't belong or something. I don't know but it's different for other people. I hope japan should be more open and diverse.\n\nI don't know if japan is<b>  racist</b> but I think they just patronize their own so much that they closed their minds to others.",

In fact many of the so - called modern day Asians are so bent on being what is acceptable white, it is hard to find a truly Asian looking Asian unless you visit some mountainous rural area.  Satan's system is ruled by his seed and spread everywhere.  It is funny how people with the skin color of the dead are not only considered a curse by The Most High but are at the same time worshipped by the foolish of the earth.  So, people would prefer to look dead rather than alive.  I wonder who put that wicked notion in their heads?  It certainly did not come from the One who created them!",

The Japanese don't have to accept someone as a good representative of their people when she doesn't look very Japanese and holds Americanized views of \"diversity\" that go against the Japanese people.\n\nShe even said, 'I want to start a revolution,' she told AFP. 'I can't change things overnight but in 100-200 years there will be very few pure Japanese left, so we have to start changing the way we think.' \nShe is greatly imposing on the Japanese people by trying to start a revolution to mix up all of Japan, to change the Japanese social norms (way they think), and to assume their won't be any pure Japanese people left in 100-200 years. This Miyamoto partly grew up in the United States, and it shows through her Western ideas of diversity, which she imposes onto a Japanese society that doesn't hold such ideas.\n\nThis Miss Japan said, \"In Japan there are hardly any <b> black </b>models or TV personalities.\" So what? Who says there has to be? Dang people always trying to impose themselves on other people's countries. It's Japan! No one is entitled to someone else's country.",

Japanese people just don't like anyone who is not Japanese period. They hate the Chinese and Koreans just as much. Nowhere in that video did it say her father abandoned her, stop projecting your ignorance. All the video said was she lived with him for 2 years. He was in the military and for him to take her with him would means either marrying the mom or filing for citizenship for her. That would probably mean separating her from her mother. Speaking as someone who was in the Marines over in Okinawa, if you father a child and abandon it while in the military you will get in trouble. All she had to do is go and report him and the military would take child support out his check.",

Again, it's not <b> racism </b>to think she isn't a good representative of Japan. The Japanese are saying she's not a good representative of Japan because she doesn't look very Japanese and she promotes American values of diversity, which is the truth. Remember that she grew up in America for parts of her childhood.\nIt's not the case that the Japanese have to except everyone in the world as a good representative of the<b>  nation</b> of Japan.\n\nIt seems like you're only seeing things from one side, that of diversity. I'm sure many people think thi<b> s woma</b>n and the people supporting her are being the \"asshole\" because they're trying to impose a different representation and belief on the whole of Japan. It's like I said earlier, \"I know I'd feel like a jerk if I went to Japan and represented the country as a person who didn't look very Japanese while at the same time telling them they should look less Japanese and be more diverse like America.\"  \n\nFrom the Washington Post article, \"Japan's ha<b> lf-bla</b>ck Miss Universe says discrimination gives her \u2018extra motivation'\n\"But Miyamoto told AFP that she was keenly aware of the lack of substant<b> ive bl</b>ack media personalities in her home country. She said she wanted to help transform Japan into a place where people won't worry anymore about their own racial backgrounds.\"\n'I want to start a revolution,' she told AFP. 'I can't change things overnight but in 100-200 years there will be very few pure Japanese left, so we have to start changing the way we think.'\n<b> This w</b>oman wants to start a revolution and transform Japan to her liking, according her her own biased perspective, which isn't the perspective of the typical Japanese person. No wonder many Japanese are against her. \nIn the article is seems she looks up to American supermodel Naomi Campbell for inspiration, not to any Japanese person.  \n\nI'm sure if you ask the Japanese people if being<b>  half </b>Black American and promoting American values of diversity in an effort to make Japan less Japanese is the representative imagine of the Ja<b> panese</b> woman, they'd say \"no, it isn't.\"\n\nFrom hindustantimes article \"Half-Japanes<b> e, hal</b>f-black: Why new Miss Japan isn't 'Japanese enough'\" \n\"many of the highest-rated comments\" about Miyamoto on the Japanese site GirlsChannel \"said that they wanted a more Japanese contestant to represent Japan.\"",

Here in the US we are used to diversity, so we accept it. Imagine if some light-skinned biracial girl became Miss Sudan. Sudanese people are known for having really dark skin. I'm pretty sure most Sudanese people would be angry that someone who doesn't look Sudanese is representing them.",

I have never understood someone not liking a person or trashing a person because of their skin color. As if someone's skin color has anything to do with their personality. It just goes to show how annoyingly surface people are. They never want to see what's on the inside, always what's on the outside.

Blacks, Latinos and Japanese / Koreans / Chinese are also discriminated in the US, their motherland which their forefathers had help built. Don't force a people to change their culture.\u00a0 A Japanese is not a <b> nationality </b>but a member of an<b>  ethnic</b> group. Chinese and Koreans can assimilate into the Japanes<b> e rac</b>e just like those Chinese who have successfully assimilated into the Thai and Filipino people, respectively.<b>  A bla</b>ck or white Thai or Filipino national would never be elected to be the prime minister like the Chinese who are Thais and Filipinos. The fi<b> rst wo</b>man president of the Philippines, Corazon Aquino Cojuanco, was a Chinese descent but the Filipinos saw her a true blue Filipino. China people have always perceived Singapore as a Chinese country and it is the Chinese Singaporeans who have repeatedly emphasised they are not but a multi-ra<b> cial na</b>tion and they don't identify themselves with the Chinese in China as kin and kith but loyal to Singapore as their fatherland and their fellow Singaporeans who are also Malays, Indians, Eurasians, Sikhs and Pakistanis, who also harbour no loyalty to their ancestral lands. This has offended the China people who accused Chinese Singaporeans for \"forgetting their roots\".\u00a0 Would a US rap-group formed by East Asians become popular? Could a Bollywood lead actress who's Japanese be popular among Indians?",

Men get into physical fights regulary and it is accepted culturasly. Also, high IQ is not something someone is born with, you can learn how to understand \"patterns\" by studying it. Especially if you have a school system that is geared towards always rigidly finding a pattern (which can create a <b> blind </b>spot, since there isn't always a pattern and the real success is found outside of the conventional pattern). The IQ test is only one test and that's all. But look at the economic stagnation in South Korea and Japan. High unemployment, low innovation and they're utterly stuck without any idea of how to renew their economy. They're stuck in a pattern and don't know how to renew and move forward. Also, very high hopelessness and suicide rate amongst young people. Obviously 18 hour school days isn't resulting in them coming up with the new Google or Space X. Majority of the population, In addition, China and India are dirt poor, and the sample of the students who take the IQ test is already the top students who have been vigorously educated. Why would all these countries not beat Europe and the US in innovation and economy if high IQ was so important?\n\n\nBtw, there is a lot of crime in South Korea, but crime looks different over there. Most drugs aren't criminalized. Prostitution is a huge problem, more than 1 million women participate and it generates about $13 billion a year. Lot's of crimes related to that goes unreported. It also has a relatively high government corruption ranking for a developed country, especially with cartels swindling people out of money. Most of the schemes are slow and a long con. Also, the usual<b>  sex</b> crimes, domestic violence etc are just like in any other place.",

The problem isn't so much the presence of other <b> ethnic </b>groups, but the lack of cultural integration, and the problem of social incompatibility of certain populations. Japan and Korea being homogeneous is largely the reason for their success as societies. A society that is too diverse is one in which its ideas, principles, morals, ways of life, etc. are also too diverse, which means it cannot function realistically as a united civilization due to no one being able to agree with anyone else on anything, nor can it produce well since everyone's behavior (informed each by their unique cultural differences) is significantly different from everyone else's. This is the worst case scenario, obviously, but hypothetically, if my culture tells me, a<b>  woman</b>, to speak my mind but someone else thinks women shouldn't have opinions over men due to their religion...I'm sorry, we won't be able to work together and we can't possibly benefit the community in which we both live. There is also the inherent collective personality characteristics of a culture, which, can work with compatible cultures, but with cultures that are too far apart, can't function. That's why for Japan, for example, Korean and Chinese or other East Asian immigrants likely wouldn't affect their society that much, since all these cultures were from <b> a commo</b>n root and share similarities already. \n\nA society is much like a business, if you get hired into the company, you better display the same qualities and attributes that made that company great in the first place.

Plus, in the end, if Miss Japan's parents believed they loved each other enough regardless of skin color, that's all that matters.",

Immigrants who do not completely adapt or integrate into the host country's culture while harboring their own culture that maybe incompatible is categorically not good for the host country. Vice versa, immigrants with similar value systems and cultural norms as the host country they are immigrating to will benefit that country. This is just historically been the social pattern across many cultures and time periods, personal plights aside.",

Culturally and genetically she is Japanese, but people tend to look on the outside. On a level of cultural acceptance, it's going to be difficult considering how hard it is to become a Japanese citizen; Japan is not a country like the U.S. It's not as culturally diverse, nor should it be. Imo i would prefer if countries were homogeneous. Ofc, that's up for debate.",

May be we had more women in America that was taken advantage of during the days I just don't want to talk about but yall have a chance to do it differently, I don't know what they teach in Japanese school. But we are all one big global family. This demonic utterance must be halted. I count my self as <b> African </b>American,<b>  black</b>, and I do have a a bunch of races probably in my blood. The point is to live and enjoy the gift of life. Why put down on a very exceptiona<b> l woma</b>n who didn't even have choice to be here or anybody for the fact of color. Most people on america consid<b> er <b> ori<b> ent</b</b</b>>>al or asian people to be smart and educated in these things. This is news to me. Hafu, Wow just when I thought the world could not get any crazier I learn there exist Hafu, That hurts her, If only she knew. Jehovah intended for humans to mingle. He just want them to serve him his way. They had Orientals in Bible, Africans in the Bible, all kinds of people. All from Gen.2:18. Now here in some case slavery was invovled but over there I'm sure the Two people must of had some type of feelings for each other. She was born out of Violence or slavery. Or worse a war. I hope yall realize that we have to live forever on this earth together. With these new inventions its going to bring us closer. Jehovah love the Japanese people just like he lov<b> e the Af</b>rican people and wants them to love each other. May Jehovah bless my Japanese brothers, and all thoughs who really want live into a better society where all people are treated kindly and with respect.",

I think the reason, why her Asian features aren't more pronounced is because Blacks and Asians share similar features, like white noses and full lips. So when ever we see those features we think, negroid instead of other races of people who share the same features. Not if she were Japanese and white, here wider nose and fuller lips would make since. A lot of white and Asian mixes look Latino, especially the females, because of the fuller lips, nose and skin tone. So I'm just giving people to something to think about next time when they say she doesn't look Asian.",

What does that have to do with anything? Why does her not speaking English, a foreign language, in Japan be an issue? Her cultural identity is Japanese. And not every Japanese person is bullying her. Clearly, many support her and pageant judges, who were Japanese, selected her as Miss Japan. By your logic, anyone bullied should deny their entire country's populace recognition. Instead of telling people to study psychology, which I think you ought to heed your own advice, you should study some logic.",

Everything from their face shapes to the features on their faces, to their disgusting  crooked teeth make me want to throw up. It is only the very top models or people that take care of themselves that look good in Japanese society. Many of these people take inspiration from western society and that includes having nice teeth, as in Japan it doesn't matter, and it shows. Korean girls are fine though, and Han Chinese are ok, except for the chubbiness of their faces but I would rather die than date the average Japanese girl.",

Like I said she should of ran for Mrs USA because at least there she can represent a lot of people that are high school drop outs.  Just another person of color looking for a FREE ride and she got it for one year by 'being given the title' Ms Japan. Oh and comments about her looks are appropriate because she did enter a 'beauty contest'  I dont have to justify my beauty until I enter such a contest.  So I dont need to explain my looks to you.

This epitomizes the affirmative action THEFT perpetrated by the diversity crowd like yourself.  No different than the Grab and Dash enrichment you bring to society.  Naomi clearly demonstrated her skills and won.  The other blafu 'won' by being a high school ugly dropout.  Its like Naomi losing all her matches in a tournament yet still being given the TROPHY.",

Why? \n\nYes, a lot of us have been discriminated against in our childhoods for more than j<b> ust r</b>ace, so that apparently makes it okay? Can you just stop and think about that for a moment before you say anything? Maybe it's valid for you to be angry that racial discrimination gets more coverage than the subtler types, that everyone gets picked on for something different at some point, but you can agree that it's all horrible right? So why don't we try to be decent human beings and try to lessen the suffering of others when we can?",

Tho I'm not p<b> art bl</b>ack, I've been discriminated in US just for looking Hispanic, and have heard enough racial \"color\" comments rampant in US, compared to in Japan, comments are about \"foreigners\" as a whole (it's not really about \"color\").

Any Americans, including African-Americans, making ignorant, racially charged retaliatory comments against an entire country based on  comments of a few narrow minded Japanese who probably grew up in a different era ought to turn on their TV's. How many Asians other than that guy forced to act like a buffoon on Two Broke Girls do you see on American TV? What about mainstream American movies that don't take place in San Francisco, or doesn't have kung fu in it?  Hmmm... It's easy to point fingers.\n\nAs for Ariana Miyamoto, despite her stories of set backs it looks like she had plenty of friends growing up and got to be Miss Japan beating hundreds of girls with two Japanese parents so painting a country that's against her just doesn't fly.",

First off, I'm not a \"blafu\" and I do not possess \"african-/american\" <b> nationality.</b> Also, I was hoping a proper comment from you would come out, but I shouldn't expect anything from someone thinking Ariana is just like any other 'black' person, even though she clearly is half-japanese and is a citizen. I suppose according to your way of thinking, all 'east asians' are smart and all 'white' people are<b>  racist</b>. So I don't see a point or even bother arguing with someone who uses WN logic and is no different from a BLM person who hates someone over their 'white' skin.\n\nI'll leave it at that.

Hell, you always see mixed raced celebrities these days on Japanese tv and out in public. But the fact that she made a comment about wanting to start a revolution to make the <b> ethnic </b>Japanese people go extinct isn't going to make her any better. It's her stubborn self conscious attitude that's making it difficult for herself. She had the honor to become Miss Japan, yet all she talks about on media are how she wishes pure Japanese people would go extinct and how she thinks she was victimized of \"bullying\" due to her skin color. Her being mixed<b>  race</b> doesn't mean anything, it's her ATTITUDE thats bring out the negativity to the public.",

Miss Japan should be someone who represents Japan, both appearance and culture.   I don't understand why America is always trying to change the world to be like America which is all screwed up.  Anyone can marry anyone and anything, anyone can take hormones and plastic surgeries to be a <b> woman,</b> a man,  a panda etc etc.   I won't be surprised one day to see the average American has one side of the body looking like a man and dressing like a man and then another side looking like a<b>  woman</b> and dressing like <b> a woma</b>n.  I won't be surprised to see one day Americans will have a human body on the top half and then a horse's body on the bottom.  America is pushing the whole world to erase differences.  Yet, roses are still called roses, and apples are still called apples. Why don't they just call apples and roses as one name and call them \"plants\".  Why do they have to label them differently?  Better yet, why don't supermarkets just give the customers marijuana when people are buying lettuce. After all, they are all plants.  If only the world follows everything America promotes and advocates.....everybody will not know the difference between shitting and eating.  Preserving a country's tradition, culture and her people's bloodline doesn't equal <b> to raci</b>sm.  America has the biggest propaganda machine and marketing scams to promote the country's radical agendas, and then attack other countries' values by painting them as really bad.  I am not Japanese but I agree with the Japanese here.",

Whereas the girl in the video is not. You're mixing up completely different isssues. (They are genetically as distant to her as you would be to say Australians) So what are you even getting at? What do you want from her? And do you have ANY point whatsoever? \n\nYou're forgetting that you can hold the development of whites against Asians, Africans, native Americans and native Australians. You cannot however hold it against mixed people because they weren't around until recently and you don't know how things would have played out if they had existed then. \n\nThe only thing we do know is that mixed (<b> black-</b>white) people have a grater number of over-achievers in sports, music and the arts per hundered people than whites, Asians and blacks. They also have a proportionally grater number of nobel price winners and presidents than whites, Asians and especially blacks. The gap is tremendous. This is not up for discussion either, it's a fact. You can confirm it by taking a calculator,  researching the number of high-achievers in the given area and putting it into relation to the population size of directly mixed people vs. any other<b>  ethnicity</b>. \n\nIf you ever do this you will also notice that the golden child, ie mixed (Asian-white) people, have an extremely low number of high-achievers in relation to their population size (there are far more of them tha<b> n blac</b>k&white mixed people). \n\nSo much for the alleged negati<b> ve bla</b>ck influence.",

They were also responsible for possibly the greatest atrocity of the Late Middle Ages in the Siege of Baghdad.\n\nThe most prolific and longest running slave trade in history was the Arab Slave Trade, which again included white Europeans from the Mediterranean and even in one instance as far north as Iceland. Along with, obviously, Africans, Asians, and people from all over the world. The Arab Slave Trade also started 800 years before the European-run Atlantic Slave Trade and lasted an additional 100 years after it had ended.\n\nUmayyad caliphate conquered the Iberian Peninsula and they and subsequent Muslim civilizations colonized and ruled white European land for 500 years, 700 until they were fully expelled (this is twice as long as the entire extent of the British Empire). The Ottomans did the same thing to the Balkan Peninsula for almost 400 years.\n\nNot only are white people by no stretch of the imagination responsible for the \"majority\" of <b> racist </b>acts or interracial atrocities, but there has also been a disturbing amount of atrocities committed by the Arab world against the rest of the world, in particular whites, that<b>  nobody</b> seems too concerned about. Why are white people the only ones expected to feel racial guilt? Where are the demands that the Muslim world apologize for the conquest of white Iberia? Where are the apologies for the Arab Slave Trade? Why is th<b> e natio</b>n of Turkey not wracked with guilt over slaughtering the Byzantines in 1453? When will Mongolia apologize for destroying 1000 years of knowledge in the libraries of Baghdad and murdering half a million civilians? \n\nNah, I guess it's only white people that are to blame, right?",

Although her father is an Afro American, I`m quite sure that her heart is Japanese and she is really Yamato Nadeshiko (Japanese <b> woman </b>with all the traditional graces.). That`s why her remark about<b>  racism</b> in Japan shocked and made me sad. Whether we like it or not, Japan is in a transitional period from highly homogenious society to more multiracial and multicultura<b> l natio</b>n. Judging from what`s going on in Europe, Japan should not accept huge number of \u00a0immigrants right now, but we should be more generous to people with foreign origin as far as they\u00a0 respect our culture, language and Japanese society as a whole. I believe that Ms. Ariana Miyamoto is a full-fledged member of the Japanese family.",

Does this warrant getting flooded by middle eastern immigrants who don't know how to read write and are in general less intelligent than the white Europeans?\u00a0\n\nI don't think it is worth it, the state should seek solutions to raise birthrates in its own population. Perhaps if people worked less hours and got more pay, if housing was cheap etc... they would make babies.

If there is even such a thing.\n\nConcrete facts as to why a society MUST be multi cultural? What are the negative effects of a homogeneous society?\n\nCountries have always had immigration, but what we are seeing today is more of an invasion. Tell me why you support millions upon millions of muslims entering Europe? And why is a native who is nervous at the prospect considered a <b> racist </b>for voicing his fucking opinion on this issue?\n\nYou liberals have no answers for these questions, multiculturalism is an absolute truth which you cannot reasonably defend and which cannot be opposed by reasonable people. This is why you stifle ALL conversation, and this is why, we, who were silenced are voting for the only party willing to speak about the issue. And what do you do? You call us all bigoted racists.\n\nGood job alienating the population you fucking idiots. \u00a0\n\nThe main reason why there is this insane amount of immigration in Europe is simply because of our social benefits, benefits that my parents will work their entire lives to provide. There is no way these people will get into the workforce anytime soon, they can't speak the language and their average skills compared to a native of the same<b>  age</b> group are tragically low. Some of them can't read for fuck sake.\u00a0\n\nThese people will end up on welfare being housed in a ghetto project where they will be among other men in a similar situation and guess what? Crime WILL SURGE.\n\nDoes bringing up rational social issues and consequences make me <b> a racis</b>t? Am I supposed to ignore the societal impact of mass immigration on my country and social system????\n\nWhat about how our democracy will drastically change if there is a foreign population taking more and more votes?? I will basically lose my fucking country to democracy because of mass immigration, what is happening in the US. A president must have the Mexican a<b> nd Bla</b>ck vote to get any chance in the primaries.\u00a0\n\nThe Democrats have the upperhand because t hey always promise benefits and lean immigration policies. Its a self perpetuating cycle, the Republicans are being immigrated out of power. The whole democracy has been destroyed by a complete change in demography.\u00a0\n\nIf I import Sunni Muslims into my country and we are given a vote on how to punish infidelity, they will vote according to their Sharia law! I will vote according to my liberal western philosophy, there will be a war of two completely \u00a0un-unifiable ideologies. There will be tension! And all this mess for what exactly?\n\nJust so we can look at our country's diversity statistics and see as many brown people as white people? Just to satisfy the globalist scum who is destroying heritage, identity and democracy!?\n\nI don't want globalism, I want to go to Japan and see Japanese people, I want to go to Stockholm and see a majority of white Swedes. I want to go to China and see the Chinese!\n\nIf this makes me a fascist I will proudly wear that badge, and if the left doesn't soften up to differing opinions they will be creating an environment where physical conflict will be the ONLY option.\u00a0\n\nBelieve me if it comes to that you'll wish you never started this thing.",

I think a more accurate assessment is that people have a kneejerk distaste for anything well outside the norm. That creates an automatic response that goes \"SHE doesn't deserve any good thing because of THAT difference alone!\".  Even worse, a lot of people will go so far to say \"People like THAT (whatever THAT happens to be) deserve outright disrespect or shunning due to THAT trait alone\".  The latter type of people can be only average or slightly above in achievement and still get bullied. That shows that jealousy over \"this\" or \"that\" great thing is not necessary to inspire one to bully that person.",

So it seems like Japan is starting to be more accepting of \"hafu\" culture but there are some still of the older and even younger generation who feel like their sort of an impurity of sorts... But that is just my take on what these very small groups of Japanese citizens have said... I've heard they're pretty accepting of foreigners and people like that but they never truely treat them like they are Japanese even after they've become a full citizen there is always something different about them. Which that I could understand because foreigner",

However, there's something you're missing, and it's that since ancient times human kind has been doing the same thing over an over again, and the result of those changes is the culture you are proud of today, which hasn't existed static, its roots were in the J\u014dmon period, at that time the influences from Asia, Europe, and North America were combined to create the now known as \"japanese population\", also your writing wasn't originally yours, but you took it from China. Was that bad? not at all, it was useful to spread knowledge in Japan, until the writing was fit into a more likely japanese style and everybody was able to use it and understand it. However, maybe you're right about me and maybe I priorize a feel-good rhetoric, but that's how the world is today and the international understanding it's growing up, and wars won't be \"necessaries\" to solve a conflict. On the other hand, I wouldn't say that \"Some cultures simply ARE less developed\", it's kinda insulting, I'd rather say \"developed differently\" or \"young cultures\". Finally, I remind you that the language, and culture are just tools we created, a system to survive in groups, by nature we are just animals, if you put a japanese baby in the jungle or an american baby or from any other country, all of them will behave the same, cause naturally we don't have nationalities.",

The European <b> Immigrant </b>\"crisis\", it's not a phenomena on its own, it's not like people want to go there, in uncomfortable and risky trips.

That's the real crisis, people are dying, of course they have to escape to the nearest safe country (those that sell the war weapons, ironically .-.).\u00a0\nYour point is that you want to protect what you think it's your identity, which I clarify you, it's not. The identity is an ilusion , because everything you thing, criticize, believe in, etc. It's something the culture you were born in, taught you.

Your arguements actually contradict yourself more than it is helping. Some points i see your insight on. Japan has had change within the culture. Oiran, for example, they used to be very popular but died out. Change. <b> Nobody </b>wears kimono or yukata everyday. Change. Please do not speak for Japan because i highly doubt you are Japanese.

With the appearance she doesn't look Japanese at all, you can't help many Japanese people insist she shouldn't represent as Miss Japan.\n\nAlthough I half agree with you because I can guess it didn't provoke this strong backlash if she were pale skinned Asian/Japanese or White/Japanese mixed person.

My parents have been together for 20+ years, have my four other siblings and I and take care of us well. We don't listen to rap music, or value thug life.
