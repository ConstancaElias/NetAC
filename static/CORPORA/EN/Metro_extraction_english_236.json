        "postText": "An LGBT rights activist burned down his own house because he was annoyed there was no prejudice for him to campaign against, police say.', 'Nikki Joly, 54, is accused of faking the August 2017 fire \u2013 which killed his two dogs and three cats \u2013 because he\u2019d been left bored after the passage of a nondiscrimination law in Jackson, Michigan, where he lives.', 'Afterwards, two church officials who worked alongside Joly told police he\u2019d been disappointed the Jackson Pride Parade, held five days before the fire, hadn\u2019t received more attention or protests.', 'According to cop Aaron Grove, who interviewed those workers \u2013 Barbara Shelton and Bobby James \u2013 they described Joly as \u2018very deceptive\u2019 and as having \u2018layers of manipulation.\u2019', 'Joly, a transgender man, had married girlfriend Chris Moore shortly before the fire, which prompted a $58,000 fundraising effort for the couple.', 'He took to Facebook two days after telling supporters: \u2018Yes, be angry, be very angry.', '\u2018Use that anger to force good! Use that anger to make change.\u2019', 'But police were already turning their attentions to Joly after discovering he had bought $10 of gas at a local Marathon store on the morning of the fire.', 'Joly, whose local paper awarded him \u2018Citizen of the Year\u2019 2017 for his work on advancing LGBT rights, said he had done so to cut the grass.', 'But his version of how he had spent the day meant there was only a five minute window for any arsonist to break into his home, douse it with fuel and set it ablaze.', 'Traces of gasoline were also found on the equality campaigner\u2019s clothes, The Detroit News reported.', 'Joly is said to have refused to confirm or deny setting the blaze at the rented home during a subsequent police interview.', 'The arson suspect, who made his first appearance in court earlier this month, has since denied setting the fire deliberately.', 'His attorney Daniel Barnett said Joly was happy with the level of attention he had received.', 'Barnett added: \u2018It doesn\u2019t make sense.', '\u2018He was citizen of the year. There was plenty of media coverage already before the fire.\u2019', 'The attorney also drew attention to Joly\u2019s campaigning, and highlighted how much he had done for the cause of LGBT rights in Jackson.",

I am from Poland and english is not my first language, but from the article I am getting that Joly is a <b> woman.</b> It confuses me why author of article is using words such as \"he\" or \"his\" when he is describing her actions or who she is. Is it some kind of rule about calling females males?",
