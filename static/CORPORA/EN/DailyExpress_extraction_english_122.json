        "postText": "'The shadow Foreign Secretary was pushing forward Labour\u2019s new plans to legislate against Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). But host Robert Peston immediately picked up on why the Labour Party were making such a move as NDAs are enforced on colleagues who want to speak publicly about anti-Semitism. He went on to accuse Ms Thornberry of dodging his questions.', 'Ms Thornberry said: I think what we would do is we want to legislate against these sorts of agreements that stop people from giving evidence or coming out about harassment, anti-Semitism, racism, sexism.', 'These sorts of things where you\u2019re certain you should not.', 'Mr Peston said: You\u2019re a straight talker, Emily.', 'You\u2019re slightly dodging this question.', 'Are you saying your colleagues are wrong to be enforcing NDAs in the case of colleagues who want to talk publicly about anti-Semitism?', 'Ms Thornberry said: I don\u2019t quite understand.', 'I don\u2019t know all the ins and outs of it.', 'I have not seen the program, I don\u2019t know all the details.', 'I\u2019m helping you as best I can.', 'Her comments come as eight former Labour officials spoke on a BBC Panorama documentary called Is Labour anti-Semitic despite four of them having previously signed NDAs on the subject matter.', 'A Labour spokesman said: We completely reject any claim that the Labour Party is anti - Semitic.Labour is taking decisive action against anti - Semitism, doubling the number of staff dedicated to dealing with complaints and cases.', 'It appears these disaffected former officials include those who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, worked to actively undermine it, and have both personal and political axes to grind.', 'This throws into doubt their credibility as sources.', 'Posting on his website, the Labour leader also stated: Labour is an anti - racist party to its core and has a long and proud history of standing against racism, including anti - Semitism.', 'I have campaigned against racism all my life and the Jewish community has been at the heart of the Labour party and progressive politics in Britain for more than a hundred years.', 'There is no place for anti-semitism or any form of racism in the Labour party, or anywhere in society, and we will make sure that our party is a welcoming home to members of all communities.'",

It\u2019 s funny how neither the Panorama programme, nor any of the MSM is willing to talk about it.The Peterborough by election demonstrated yet again that the Labour Party is courting votes from one particular grouping aided and abetted by an Electoral Commission not fit for purpose and a totally corrupt postal voting system. Labour has been courting this community\u2019 s vote since the late - 90 s - and, with the aid of postal voting has been able to gerrymander huge numbers of backers..........Peterborough is a prime example - there are many others. It has no interest in the Jewish vote when its favoured electorate is actively opposed. The Panorama programme was disturbing - more so for the fact that anti - Semitism, holocaust denial is now intrinsic to the Labour Party and the negligence of its leadership legitimises it. Quite why Jewish MPs - Margaret Hodge, Ruth Smeeth and many others remain attached to it I do not know given the amount of abuse they have suffered.",
