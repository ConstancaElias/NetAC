        "postText": "'Donald Tusk has been President of the EU Council since 2014. He played an important part in the Brexit negotiations with Prime Ministers Theresa May and Boris Johnson. Twitter users gave mixed responses to his video as one said: What on Earth did I just watch? Another wrote good riddance while others wished luck for the future.', 'In the video, it said: these five years have passed so fast. ', ' Running 48 EU leaders\u2019 meetings. ', ' Taking the pulse of Europe. ', ' Racing for Europe\u2019 s place in the world. ', ' A sprint to save the planet, time to say goodbye. ', ' It was quite a run!', ' The video comes just weeks after Mr Tusk was accused of meddling in British politics after urging Remainers to continue fighting to reverse Brexit.', ' He had previously told those hoping to reverse the 2016 referendum not to give up their fight during the general election campaign.', ' He praised them for taking Brexit into extra time and suggested penalties could soon follow to finally deliver a killer blow to Britain\u2019 s EU departure.  ', ' Speaking at the College of Europe in Brugge, Mr Tusk  Referencing a German philosopher, he added: Hannah Arendt taught that things become irreversible only when people start to think so. ', 'So the only words that come to my mind today are simply: Don\u2019 t give up.In this match, we are already in extra time, perhaps it will even go to penalties ? ', ' Former Brexit secretary David Davis warned the eurocrat to keep his nose out of domestic politics, urging him to learn lessons from the past. ', ' Writing on Twitter, Mr Davis said : Donald Tusk is unwise to ignore the convention of staying out of internal politics of member states.', 'Foreign leaders should stay out of our democratic decisions, whether they are Obama, Trump or Tusk.', 'Former President Barack Obama sparked fury during the 2016 referendum campaign for claiming Britain would be at the back of the queue for a trade deal with US if voters backed Brexit.'",
