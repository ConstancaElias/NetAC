Examples of <b> ageism </b>I've witnessed include (1) much younger people addressing older people as \"Honey\" or \"Sweetie\", (2) using baby talk or high-pitched voices, or (3) talking to family members or others about an older person (instead of to that older person directly) when that older person is present.",

As a 71 years young passionate person  I believe that <b> ageism </b>in Australia does not go far enough and that some of the issues raised are ignored by older adults themselves. In this regard, consciousness, spirituality [non-religious] creativity, mindfulness embracing challenges of growth and eventual phase known as 'death,' should be a part of the broader conversation and involvement.",

I find the arts sector less judgmental than some others. I'm also finding that new conversations needs to happen which rely on my creativity and assertiveness in order to gain traction.  We are a large group of people, who together can make a difference to the quality of life in Australia, perhaps in non-traditional ways. I find that Regional Australia is very accepting of our talents and can-do mentality. Research shows that we solve complex problems faster, given breadth and depth of experience of life.",
