        "postText": "The comedian was branded as ageist after he ridiculed the older generation during BBC Politics Live on Thursday. Mr Shar said: I think that it\u2019s just a sort of generation at the top who are monopolising certain things and we are currently living through an attempted recreation of someone else\u2019s good old days, which stands in the way of making good new days I think. Much of it is oh, do you remember the good old days when you could leave your front door unlocked and everyone had polio.', 'In response, commentator Melanie Phillips said: I think this is distinctly ageist, if you don\u2019t mind my say so.', 'There is a big problem with young people getting on the housing ladder, especially in London - no question about that.', 'But this idea like the baby boomer generation of whom I am, you know, you\u2019ve got everything and we have got nothing and therefore it is your fault we have got nothing.', 'That\u2019s not very nice. That is not really a way to run a society.', 'Ms Phillips insisted the baby boomer generation do not have it all. She said: I think the baby boomers have got a lot but I have never understood or I have never sympathised with this idea that because there is a problem young people getting on the housing ladder - big problem - we should address that and we should build more houses.', 'But the idea that you want to blame people who have advantages because it is their fault. I think this is unpleasant and unwarranted.', 'The comedian fired back and said: I think it does become a certain problem when it feels certainly like people are moving the ladder up from beneath them and setting fire to the ladder and all of that sort of business.', 'But if we are talking about ageism, and I must say that occasionally my opinions are exaggerated for comic effect. But if we talk about yes there is some possibility some ageism there.', 'There is also some ageism in the fact that something for example something that is being driven through the country at the moment that is largely voted for by an older generation against the wishes of a younger generation is now being framed as the explicit, untrammelled will of the people that must be carried through.', 'Daily Express analysis of official figures shows rising property prices have forced more than a quarter of young adults to live with their parents.', 'Record numbers of those aged 20 to 34 cannot afford to leave the nest because of high rents and daunting mortgage deposits and payments.', 'The number has increased by an extra 5,500 every month over the last 15 years, according to the data.', 'It found 26 per cent of young adults are now living with their parents - a total of 3.4 million. In 2002 there were a million fewer.', 'Angus Hanton, the co-founder of the pressure group Intergenerational Fairness, said: Many young people simply cannot afford to fly the nest when they face stagnant wages, precarious employment, unpaid internships, and high student debt.', 'The Office for National Statistics figures show the numbers living at home have increased three per cent in the last year, eight percent over the last five years, 28 percent over the last 10 years and 41 percent since 15 years ago.'",

For a start most youngsters spend 20 years of their lives in education. They have the ability to travel all over the world and many do take that opportunity instead of saving. Many youngsters also prefer to cohabit with someone but lead separate lives instead of pooling their money. Most youngsters have more money in their pocket to spend on nights out, clothes, entertainment and everything g that comes with the \u2018consumer\u2019 generation that they are. i started out at 16 yrs <b> old </b>as a shorthand typist in a typing pool.I had a second job delivery morning papers so I could save some money for my future.My parents encouraged me to save every penny.I got married at 24 yrs<b>  old</b> and both my fianc\u00e9 and I had a few thousand behind us to put down on a small house.We both did two jobs to make ends meet.We never went out the way youngsters do now.We didn\u2019 t even drink the way they do now. we really have to stop this blame game.The baby boomer generation has created opportunities for this generation.That no one ever had before.If they choose to waste those opportunities by the brainwashing of media and celebrity, they have only themselves to blame.

Best to let them play to empty theatres then they might get the message that nothing they have to say is funny.",
