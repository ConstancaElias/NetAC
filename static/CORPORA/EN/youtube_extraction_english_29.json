I felt so unwelcome in that community. There's no way I could list here number of horrible awful things that happened to me in that community, all blatantly <b> gender </b>based. Including but not limited to pedophillic<b>  sexual</b> assault and revenge porn. I wish I could enjoy video games but it's clear to me that this is a boys only club and you guys don't want to let us in. Well you're doing a damn good job but I currently go to a nationally ranked (#1 public uni) art school for animation and many amazing women are busting their asses making beautiful, thought provoking, cutting edge stuff. Everything from side scrollers to VR. We'll just see if thei<b> r gende</b>r affects their ability to be hired on by your disproportionately male game companies. \n\nIf you wanna talk gendered hobbies, I don't know a sing<b> le wom</b>an who was upset about James Charles becoming a face of covergirl. I knew several men that were upset though.\n\nVideo games have so much potential and it's a real shame to see them put in this hypermasculine box. It's funny you say games are made 'by men, for men' when you flash some of the few examples of games made to be marketed towards women, or towards everyone or are made by women. This is not reserved for men only. You're limiting more than just us, you're limiting yourselves. The future will tell that you're on the wrong side of things my dude. Make more games for everyone.",

Yeah, there's always been women in games who were eye candy, but there have been plenty of women in video games who were serious, fleshed out characters, especially in the jrpg genre. They don't know that shit because they didn't become interested in video games until the industry exploded during the late 2000's, then when it became lucrative, they demanded a piece.

            "commentText": "As a female gamer who admittedly clicked on this video to reinforce my opinion that the idea of <b> sexism </b>in video games is stupid, I've gotta say that I completely disagree with your argument. Saying that men struggle to design games for women is fair enough, but it sounds like you're suggesting that men can't represent women at all in their games which is totally false. You don't have to be a<b>  woman</b> to design strong female characters the same way that you don't have to be a man to design strong males.\nSimilar to authors of books, you can design strong characters purely through good writing and an understanding of your character's psychology. I think that there are plenty of great female role-models in video games that have been designed by men and vice versa. Suggesting that guys just can't portray women is a cop-out.\nAlso, I really can't stand the \"if you don't like how video games are right now, then make one yourself and change it!\" argument... I'm a consumer. Sometimes I don't like books or movies or games or art but I'm not about to become an author, a filmmaker, a game designer, or an artist just because of that. I'm not suggesting that designers should cater to my specific demands, but rather that they should just continue to pay attention to what their marketplace and userbase is saying and take their praise and criticism to continually improve their games. Strong characters make games better, whether those characters are boys or girls.",

I dealt with a lot of sexist shit like potential bosses assuming that as a female in gaming I will fuck them to advance my career, people assuming that I don't know the absolute fucking basics and citing my <b> gender </b>as a reason, and also the pay for everyone, men and women, sucks shit.\n\nThe money in the video game industry is going to corporate and not the people making the games. The industry is shit in general. If everyone in it was fairly compensated however, I fully believe that more not absolutely shitty people would join the industry, and over time would become more welcoming to women. It's not immediate but you see it happening with software companies that pay their employees well.",

There was a final fantasy male who was sexualized and the backlash by men was so bad they had to cancel it. This is the same thing you're hating women for. So in an industry where the amount of men and women are equal, why can't you make something that women want instead of complaining that they're bitching while masturbating off to hentai made by women and screaming every time fanservice caters to females?",

Do you make the same argument when <b> ethnic </b>minorities are being left out of video games?

Also, if you think women in the gaming industry aren't facing additional barriers you've got your eyes closed.

Anita Sarkesian has even complained about how Ass Creed 2 (which this video shows was made by a <b> woman)</b> has too much violence for her. Even though that has<b>  nothing</b> to do with equality, it's just that games are being made for people other than herself.\n\nThat's how many feminists think. If something isn't made for them, it must be evil. They often have no understanding of how the world works, they just think that everything revolves around themselves (yes, I'm aware that these are only a small amount of very vocal feminists, and not all feminists do this).",

The rest truly is a rant from an uneducated fuck who has no idea that women, despite being a majority in the world, are actively oppressed by nearly every single culture in the world.  Women can always be just as strong, just as smart, and just as tough as men.  In fact, sometimes they surpass men in these attributes and vise-versa.  \n\nAll in all, I totally agree that there should be more female game creators and female everything in the world.  But I am extremely offended by your ignorance in the matter of how badly women get oppressed actively all over the world.  Shut your fucking mouth, get respectful, then post an actual video about why <b> sexism </b>is so prevalent in video games, dumbfuck.\n\nBtw this comment was made by a male.  A self-respecting Marine Corps. Veteran too.  Call me a whimp for understanding the wisdom, sanity, and righteousness of supporting feminism.  I fucking dare you.  I'll stomp on every single disrespectful scumbag that attempts to demoralize me if I have to.  In the Marines we only fight when we have to.  Give me a reason.",

Not all beautiful women are models to be objectified.  There are beautiful and sexy women scientists, police officers, <b> doctors,</b> airline pilots, etc.  It shouldn't be out of the question to have sexy heroes and video game characters. When feminists say all men objectify beautiful women, that's the feminist projecting that stereotype towards me.  I don't need a feminist to tell me how I think.  I have a mother and sisters, I respect women, but as a man I admittedly do like attractive women as I'm sure women like attractive men.",

I think the point that critics of the video game industry are trying to make isn't just that video games poorly utilize women; that's a mere symptom of the problem. The problem, which you touch on later, is just that the vast majority of video games are made for men, and women are often forced to buy and play these games due to a lack of alternatives. So developers should realize that games aren't just for men.\n\nBut, you more or less touched on that later in the video. You're right, people whining about this issue ought to make like Gandhi and be the change they want.",

                    "commentText": "+Gizmos Monster He's referring to Darc Gibson, who insulted you and your peers as an automatic response to a <b> woman </b>who decided that it simply wasn't for her.  \"She didn't stick around, so clearly the problem is the men in the room.  She didn't identify with the socially retarded men and decided they'd be better off trying a different class or trying again next year.\"\n\nIt's bullshit and he felt the need to go out of his way to insultingly and patronizingly say that the reason she didn't stay was because none of you were attractive or outgoing enough for her to identify with.  But that doesn't really explain anything, nor does your assumption that the reason she left was due to a boredom factor.\n\nSimply put, computer science and software engineering are not for everyone.  The fact of the matter is, feminists complaining about a problem that doesn't actually exist (or really matter) are bitchy because they want women to be given the role of ideas guy or lead designer with no experience or technical skills required.  And they want these positions to be turned over to women irrespective of seniority, experience, or qualifications.\n\nJade Raymond didn't get her position because of a feminist picketing outside of Ubisoft headquarters, and the all-women team who made the game Angelique Trois (in JAPAN, the alleged<b>  misogyny</b> capital of the world) all earned their jobs long before feminists decided to try and appeal to men by co-opting video games for agendas and politics.  The truth of the matter is, a lack of women in STEM fields is not because of a male power struggle or discrimination, it's due to a lack of interest of women to be in STEM fields.  Women tend to identify more with social jobs where they work with people, men tend to identify more with skilled jobs where they work independently.  This isn't me making this shit up, you can google this to your heart's content to find all kinds of statistics that show this.<b> \n\nNobod</b>y ever got into or got out of a career path based on the sociability, physical appearance, or intelligence of those in the classroom with them.  She decided it was simply not for her and she left.  If she truly wanted to make games, she either changed what her approach to the process was (because there really are a dozen ways to approach video game development), or she would have stuck around.  If she changed her career goal then it was because she decided it was simply not for her.",

Pretty much every moba ever, a lot of MMOs, card games, more and more shooters. Only because on mobile market there's a lot of scamy freemium games, doesn't mean the buisness model is intrinsically bad. Nor does it mean that there are no good games on mobile. Whether freemium or payed. Not to mention that in the triple A market you have a lot of predatory practices as well. Bugy, rushed games. Failed promises. Generating hype, to push preorders, which often have exlusive content, shitty dlc, always online, gate locking content in the game to pad it out. Or how more and more games have some sort of progression attached to it, designed to keep you playing. So what the fuck are you complaining about?",

Tell me, which of these do you think were designed to be games, and which ones were designed to generate cash? League of Legends, or Kim Kardashian: Hollywood? Battlefield 4 or Candy Crush? The Witcher 3 or Dungeon Keeper: Mobile?\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that the mobile freemium model is built with making a profit at its core, then a game is tacked on afterwards. Whereas \"Triple A\" games are designed to be games, and the freemium model is tacked on afterwards. (if there even is a freemium model in them, thank god for Bethesda and CD Projekt <b> Red<b> )</b</b>>\n\nOh, and the fact that mobile freemium bullshit is creeping into Triple A games is the reason I talk so much shit about mobile games. It seems like the big players in AAA gaming are bloated greed machines who only care about money, hence why assassin's creed is the same game every year.\n\nSo fuck mobile games with fake economies and microtransactions, and fuck \"AAA\" games with microtransactions.",

I'm looking at a study now of 89 female gamers, about 50% of them say they prefer consoles, and the top 3 are Wii, Xbox 360, and PS2 (this was 2012) while under 20% said they prefered mobile games. In fact, males tend to consider themselves more frequent or \"expert\" gamers, but tend to play mostly violent games and mostly on PC, which females consider themsevles occasional or \"novice\" gamers tend to be more evenly distributed between violent/non-violent and PC/Console/Mobile. A little googling can show you that female gamers are a valid and varied demographic, not just teenage girls playing Candy Crush on their iPhone.\n\nhttp://usabilitynews.org/video-games-males-prefer-violence-while-females-prefer-social/",

Essentially the argument is that there are magazines made to cater women that feature little content for men. In the same way there are games made that cater mainly to men. At the end of the day there are games and magazines that cater to a variety of audiences, but the gaming industry has fewer companies creating content that caters to women. Basically, if you want games that cater to everyone in the same way you have a variety of magazines, you need people who are willing to create that content. If all you got from the video was \"games=men, magazines=women\" you clearly weren't paying attention.",

(I am ignoring the fact that for some stupid reason the <b> gender </b>neutreal magazines like \"what next week in tv\" still have lightly dressed women up front)) but coming to video games there are nearly no games you can play as a female and not feel horrible because your armour is basically a bra.

Now, the market is wider. I was constantly beaten up in school by boys and girls for playing videogames a lot and reading books. Now, everyone is a \"tr00 n3rd g33k g4m3r\" for playing Minecraft and Call of Duty when they don't even know Doom. Same with using glasses. Shit, using glasses was like signing a certificate of nerdiness and it means being a punchbag. Fuck, until 2010 no one would praise for spending 10h a day playing a game, they would go casually without even bothering much, now, it is a job. Since I came first, I will call it cultural appropriation and just let people buy videogames if they are <b> scrawny </b>nerds, the only tr00. If they're not, I'm triggered.",

But I can really say that I bought some games just because of the boobs (Gauntlet Dark Legacy I just used the women, Champions of Norrath series was just the females), and also that a lot of men are called because of this, when I was a child, the boys would fight to use Angel in King of Fighters. I think that generally the female characters are the \"deceiving ones\": they look weak, but actually they are OP as bloody fucking hell (especially in RPGs). I just don't understand why some would say \"u're <b> gay<b> \"</b</b>> for using a female character, lol, I heard this so much when I was younger. Now, the same people say the inverse, because they like female bodies.",

There's a considerable population of female gamers and for this reason I do believe that a little more representation is reasonable, and same could be said for the racial divide.\n\nStill, I do think it should be acknowledged (as far as the hyper-sexualization goes) that male bodies tend to cross those unparalleled standards as well, with ridiculously unattainable muscle masses and such rather than tits and ass",

Video games are one of the most recent art forms- but video games as we know them were conceived of during the 70's-80's, a time during which the adults still carried the ideals of their parents, and chauvinism was all but socially acceptable.  Now, the baby boomers are retiring and newer generations are gradually inheriting the reigns, bringing fresh ideals into gaming, the likes of which many people of all genders/sexual orientations are presently enjoying.  I'd say that females don't technically have equivalent representation in the industry in terms of characters and plot, but it's getting close to that, and, at this point in time, only uneducated people believe that dudettes aren't interested in gaming, and I'm fairly confident that men (at large) take no offense to the idea of female VG characters being portrayed as regular people alongside the male ones.  I think very few people actively want to take control/power away from the opposite <b> sex </b>in an industry, aside from psychologically unstable radicals, who shouldn't really be counted among the majority.",

It's a <b> common </b>thought that it's mostly guys that play and make games, and at the same time it drives most women away from the industry. I'd say that many women like myself that are interested in those things are a bit intimitated by the fact that the industries are so male-dominant.\nBut imo, lately the situation has been getting better over the course of the last few years. And i hope you don't think i want \"men to fix it\", i just hope that 1. women had more courage to get into the industries, 2. They'd be encouraged to do so and 3. men would (continue to) be open-minded towards the females getting into the industries.",

Most men are open-minded to women in the video game industry and other male dominated industries, they just have to fit the necessary qualifications. The video game industry is male-dominated because the stereotype is that video games are a boy's thing and that stereotype is perpetuated by everyone, not just men. Its similar for the fashion industry, men don't want to pursue because it's considered feminine and they don't want to be seen as <b> gay<b> .</b</b>> However, the times are changing, but that change should take place through more people willing to go against stereotypes, it shouldn't be up to everyone else to make them do it or to force change, it comes gradually, not overnight.",

                    "commentText": "+Mistalee I'm open minded and I appreciate a developer who does a good job, not what their <b> sex </b>is. I'm aware this is a month ago and you were highlighting gamers, but the industry itself. However, I personally haven't seen any issues with women joining the industry. In my view, every industry is the same and there are douchebag bosses. The only way around that is to not work for people like that. \n\nPeople seem to think that it's some sort of mandatory law or right and you should have just as many males as females in a company, but I don't believe that in the slightest. I believe that it should be up to the business owner and policies set by the company and if<b>  gender</b> is supposed to be equal, jobs should go to those worthy and with talent for their respected positions, regardless o<b> f se</b>x. There should be no complaining if it's all male or all female. It's not like I could easily get a job writing for a female magazine or some stereotypical soap opera, since I'm not into drama or feminine things and I wouldn't expect those companies to be hiring an equal amount of men, because that's impossible and it would hurt the business itself by doing so, because their market is in 99.9% of cases for women. You wouldn't see me watching soap operas, so why would they change the view and make it a male perspective or make it interesting for men when they'd lose their current audience? It makes no sense. \n\nI don't like this new wave <b> of femina</b>zi behavior, it's only highlighting issues that are relevant to them, not equality\u2014and most, if not all of their claims are debunked by logic and reason. Everything they strive for takes away the rights of the individual. For<b> ced gen</b>der percentages? Taking away the right of the owner to hire whom they please. For<b> cing ge</b>nder(not skill) based wages? Those who are better don't receive wages they deserve. I could go on, but you get the picture. How much you earn should be based on 3 things: skill, reliability, and time employed and if you don't have the skill they're looking for, you don't get hired. It's simple common-sense and human rights they are fucking with, which makes people so angry, not because our \"power\" is being taken away, the power still resides with the business owners and the government and no power is there to be spoken of to begin with, dumbasses. xD\n\nI encourage you to do your best and do as you please in the industry you choose, but it'<b> s not patri</b>archy if the one who got a job is a male over you, it'sthe choice of HR, management, or the business owner. There is no reason to cry as if that MAN stole anything from you, he can't control their choices and if it completely came down to skill, that's a perspective based opinion and because of individual rights, you should be okay with that. \n\nMost of my ranting is generalized and not towards you, so I apologize. Good luck.",

From enrollment mandates to Female-only game jams and contests to encourage exactly this.\n\nBut 'encouragement' is a very minor factor, since Newborn Males will focus on physical objects with sharp contrast to their environment, while Newborn Females will seek out eyes and mouths, or in their absence, softly contrasted moving shapes(bodies).  So it is more to biology than social pressures.\n\n\"Getting Better\" -- assumes there was a problem to overcome.\nAsk 100 gamers to name a game developer. If they can, it is more likely to be a <b> woman </b>than a man.  And from the 1980s-early 2000s, nearly all of them would have said Roberta Williams.\n\nMeeting her was what solidified my own determination to be in the field, despite living in an area remote enough so that I was forced to learn machine code by trial and error.\n\nFrom the infancy of video games (Roberta Williams) to Toddler-Centipede (Carol Shaw) to its adulthood Gears of War, Counterstrike Mass Effect (Bonnie Ross) and Fallout 4[and 3] (Angela Browder)-there have always been women in lead positions behind nearly every major title.\n\nThe industry in reality, is a welcoming environment. It has to be, as communication and cooperation are absolutely vital to success.\nAnd in those cases where such attitudes do crop up (Yes, I'm looking at You Zenimax!) those responsible are singled out and 'attacked' for it.\n\nAnd I blame 3rd wave Feminists' constant proclamations that it is entirely different for the few issues that do come up.\nThey convince women who would otherwise have found a rewarding career doing what they love, to avoid that occupation for fear they might find themselves in a non-existant boys club where they can expect to be mocked or cat called on a regular basis..\nAnd to attracting the sort of men who would actually want that to be the case to enter the field when they would otherwise not.\n\nBoth are gladly rare, but I can't help but wonder what we may never see created because one<b>  woman</b> or another opted for a different career because they were convinced by the very Wrong image of the industry.\n\n- Yes, there are more men in the industry... just as there are more female Teachers and Nurses.\nBut short of dictating how people live, no occupation will be 50/50, and the more Math is involved, the fewer women (statistically) and the more face-to-face interaction with a client is involved, the fewer men (statistically)\nAnd as I mentioned, these differences in 'attention' are present and observable from birth.",

As a female, you don't need to be intimidated by the male dominance, because that in itself is a self-fulfilling prophecy; if most girls are too scared to get jobs in a male-dominated industry, they will stay as male-dominated industries. Guys are not intimidated out of entering female-dominated industries like nursing and teaching (though there are some who are too insecure with their masculinity to even consider them). Become good at something and people will hire you to do it, make something good and people will buy it from you.

There are plenty of existing studies publicly available that suggest otherwise. One 2012 study showed that 50% of around 90 women surveyed prefer consoles over pc and mobile. In 2013, an executive at Infinity Ward said that 24% of people playing Call of Duty were female. A 2015 study suggests that more women own game consoles than men. Girls ARE playing games, a large amount of them. If they aren't making an effort to become a part of the gaming industry, it's not because they only play the latest Bejeweled clone on their iPhone.",

There aren't MANY studies that suggest this, and you'll find that the information they go on is VERY weak at best.\u00a0Some look at how many households HAVE a console, not whether the women themselves purchased them.\u00a0They don't take into account what is actually being played on those consoles, and the reporting of the data is super flaky. Lastly, and I'm not sure if this has actually been studied, I imagine more PC gamers than console gamers actually try their hand at development. This is pure speculation, but makes a lot of sense for obvious reasons.\n\nI honestly think its great that the number of female gamers is rising, as every guy I know would love for his girlfriend to be into games (mine is, though she prefers to watch), but you'd honestly have to ignore a lot of data to think that there is actually a 50/50 <b> gender </b>split in the gaming. Just open any gaming forum, look at the number of male gaming youtube channels, and look at the types of PC/Console game purchases. Look at who really makes up the bulk of game purchasers (physical and digital). A study of of PC gamers showed that 49% were women, then you read more into the data and you find the high majority of the \"light core and hard core\" gamers were males, and a very small percentage of those were women. High majority of women were \"casual\" gamers that play different games. I don't know about the women in your life, but pretty much none of the girls I've known (i'm 32) growing up were gamers. The rise in female gaming coincides with the release of iPhone/Android devices, and the increase of indie developers on steam, xbox live arcade and PSN having more casual light game offerings.",

Video games are not an organization with a magistrate and a bureaucracy that can say, \"Oh, not enough women? Let us change the bylaws and require 40% of positions be occupied by women and women's opinions in the boardroom must be applied 50% of the time.\" Perhaps an individual company could do that, but how would a<b>  woman</b> feel if she knew she was hired only to fill a quota so the company could be taken off Anita Sarkeesian's blacklist? It's a field with many different companies and philosophies. Maddox isn't proposing anything condescending or unrealistic. In fact, he's proposing the only thing you can do if you want to make the video game industry more inclusive: saturate the labor pool with more women.",

Yet in some video games the main character Always has some muscle to him Kratos for example had the body builder of a body builder. If video games where more realistic would sales drop of it was too realistic being that it's only a game it's not really. Again I'm sorry if I sound sexist I have no intention of so I just have some trouble understanding",

Funny thing is, as more MK games came out, there were more female characters, but then her rant was \"Why do they have to make them look slim, sexy, and toned. Why can't they use normal looking women?\" My first thought was she was a hypocrite, because she had absolutely no problem commenting on how \"hawt\" Shao Kahn's body was. And secondly, my thought was, I have never seen a <b> fat </b>or out of shape person box, cage fight, or play any kind of sport. They are all in shape and athletic.

It's plenty easy to dismiss the overt idealization of the male form and attitude as 'power fantasy', because acknowledging that it does exactly to men what sexualized forms do to women - makes them feel inferior about their own image and non-idealized traits - acknowledges that 'bad portrayal in culture!' is not the sole domain of women; it's something we all suffer from, which weakens the narrative.\n\n\nSimilarly, for every man that enjoys the 'male power fantasy' without seeing it as a negative reflection on himself, there are just as many women who indulge in<b>  sexual</b> portrayals of women. From playing MMOs and games with ACTUAL WOMEN who are in to that sort of thing, I know many, many of them gravitate towards playing characters with sexually powerful outfits and traits, for the same exact reason many men gravitate to the 'male power fantasy'.",

When someone tells a story, it should be the protagonist they choose. Trying to force a change like make Link female is just ridiculous. Let's fight against freedom of speech and make them make Link female to destroy the <b> patriarchy!</b> yawn FF7, big breasted or not, Tifa is incredible as a character. Aerith was amazing, too. I cried when she died! :( Yuffie was fine, too. It showed that characters (female) are being portrayed different, each one isn't a poster girl with big breasts and overly<b>  sexual</b>. Chrono Trigger? Even a<b> n ol</b>d Tales of title, specifically Symphonia has a variety of female personalities. Ditzy blonde,  a strong, but sexy, assassin, and a sociallly awkward nearly mute girl with super human strength. Let's go back to N64, even in Zelda, although it's not a playable character, one of Zelda's main guards is a strong female with leadership qualities and they're not detestably ugly. Then we have Perfect Dark, which is one of the most popular N64 titles having a strong, beautif<b> ul wom</b>an as the lead protagonist. In Super Mario RPG, after you save the princess, she becomes a powerful ally that is pretty damn strong herself. Witcher 2, although feminazi's cry foul and see it as smut, Triss Merigold is beautiful, sexy and strong. I'd let her take the front in any situation. if you know what I mean. \n\nBut hey, they aren't playable, so they're sexually objectified poster girls just to look at, right? They aren't AAA titles or anything and how dare they have male heroes playable because that's the story the writer envisioned! Individual rights? B<b> ah! Patriar</b>chy!",

Still not sure why you're threatened by the idea of fans getting more playable characters in the series, especially since we can play as Peach, who has way less to offer as a character.\n\nAlso, you're going to claim the writing in the Parasite Eve sequels did justice to the original?\u00a0\n\nThey're not as bad as Other M, but they're far from good.\u00a0\n\nAnd I get that you're only going to describe a limited range of body types (Kawaii petite and sexy swimsuit model) as beautiful enough for you to care about the character, but some of us are bored by that lack of imagination. Even Barbie has more range.",

            "commentText": "Sure makes sense. But when does a women ACTUALLY get these kind of opportunities. Let's be honest. You're saying that why don't women just make their own video games. How can they do that when they've got so many men telling them they can't or even not allow for such things to happen? It happens a lot I'm sure. You'll have women scattered here and there in these companies and are trying to give their input such as \"Hey, maybe we shouldn't add such big tittied women who's only job is to give <b> sex,</b> look sexy, and get rescued. Maybe they can rescue themselves?\" And then the people at the head of the corps be like \"NAHHHHHHHH,<b>  SEX</b> IS SELLING LETS KEEP SELLING NAKED WOMEN.\"\u00a0\n\nSo TL;DR: It's a lot harder to just \"Stand up, Shut up, and make your own video games.\" You're blaming \"women\" for these types of issues when it could easily be turned around to say \"Why don't men just LISTEN to us women and EVEN OTHER MEN to give better representation?\" You might say \"Well they'll lose money.\" I can promise people will be happy with the better character designs as long as the games are good. And then you might say \" Well people might still want games that have big tittied women!!!\" \u00a0There's always going to be a market for it. The mass public is going against it and even you can probably say it's ridiculous sometimes. But if that becomes the issue in the future then at that point I think the consumers (typically the men consumers because that's who I'll assume will complain since they are right now) need to grow up.",

            "commentText": "The most interesting thing is that the women who complain about <b> sexism </b>in games are actually the ones being sexist themselves in so many cases. Strong interesting 3-dimensional female characters? Well take Bayonetta for example. Caring, intelligent, fearsome, skilled, and with a tragic backstory but these women only focuses on the fact that she's hot as fuck - and they're not.\n\nBecause, apparently, women being hot-as-fuck in videogames, regardless of their other qualities, is a BIG PROBLEM insert some kind of logic here oh wait there is none. How is hot-as-fuck a problem? When did beauty become something foul and unfitting?\n\nLet me guess the answer: It's because women generally focuses on the flaws of their own body instead of their qualities. It's so ingrained in society and in the most basic instincts of females among humans, the notion that they have to look attractive and have to be more considerate of flaws both in themselves and in their partner. But it takes on a wierd form because these particular raging women, apart from us \"nerdy\" men, doesn't look at a character and go \"badass!\" but instead think \"....I'm not as attractive as she is.......\". And then they feel bad about themselves - so they blame the lack of realistic aesthetically flawed female characters.\n\nInstead of focusing on how badass this character is - they focus on how non-badass they themselves are and then blame the game for being sexist. They focus on their own flaws not being portrayed in the character they play and thus feel emotionally detached from that character.\n\nThese women are bad at roleplaying and if any of you sjw's are reading this then may I simply suggest - that you try to be the character in the game - and not yourself in another characters skin. When you play the game - try to play as the character assigned to you in the game. YOU play Bayonetta - not the other way around.\n\nSimply put - Bayonetta would probably suck if you were the maincharacter in it. Thats why you're not in it. That's why you play Bayonetta in Bayonetta. I guess you COULD have a maincharacter that's bland and doesn't love herself. But who the fuck wants to play a faceless npc backgroundcharacter with no particulary interesting personality as the maincharacter, as long as she looks right?\n\nA sexist.\n\nAnd you would also, probably, be a minority. And I don't think a company, putting millions of dollars into something, is willing to just tAke A WiLD ShOT in trying to cater to a minority that probably won't be able to pay for all those dollars put into that game. Games are not only made to entertain people. They are also made to provide a salary, a good reputation and finally profit for the people that makes them. It's a necessity that can't be thrown away if you're not already fucking loaded.\n\nBear in mind that I'm talking about the so called \"feminazis\" and \"sjw\"s types of women because they are really a minority, or so I hope and believe, among the female gaming community today.",

It looks like a low quality 3D hentai made in the 90s, only has female main characters who are badly designed and wear skin-tight latex suits and have extremely unrealistic twig-thin figures. It's exactly what feminists hate, and it was created by one who supposedly wanted to eliminate that! Truly, a masterpiece.",

EA has been corrupt in that field for ages. Ubisoft bribes the shit out of reviewers. They both didn't get half the rage or riducle as this case got.\nThen there's the argument that DQ sends out the wrong message.

She blamed all the hate on 4chan and gamers bei<b> ng misogyni</b>st in general, this got a lot of gamers angry and causing a shitstorm, which in turn caused the gaming media to denounce gamers as their audience on 11 different gaming news sites simultaneously, causing every single gamer who wasn't in on this thing to go \"wtf is going on?\" and expanding / massively jumpstarting the clusterfuck.

Enabling them to control supply, and price of diamonds.\n\nIn context of women in the gaming industry, I'm saying the industry is akin to the 70s USA. Hostile towards women, but not violently so. It will take time for the industry to change, which will in turn take time for women who are interested in making games to join big devs.\n\nThe fact that the issue is still brought up so often is a sign that there's people who are wanting change, and are forcing it by putting a light on the issue. It's why Sony had that women game dev hiring campaign. a very obvious attempt at placating anger towards them.

Doesn't have to be all women, but no objectified women. Example Dead or Alive is mostly female characters, but has a mostly male audience for obvious jiggle physics reasons. Persona and FF has enjoyed higher than average female audience because of better females and characters in general. I'd say characters that are a bit closer to ambiguous in looks tend to be more popular with ladies. The slightly girly guys have been quite popular for the past few decades. I would say, start either making games that target more towards general pop instead of just the guys, or even just adding in a something women can either identify with, find attractive, etc, really depends on the game. We got women in the military, no reason to not have em in the game.\n\nThe social engineering plot to get more women in the industry, and more core women gamers would be to slowly add in things across all core games directed at just guys that makes it feel more acceptable to have women. FPS games get their female models, not dogs. Tone down armor bikinis, add in some ambiguous male characters. Could pull a Mario 2 and have the princess as a playable character. Kirby type games are fantastic nongender specific kids games that have fans of both <b> gender,</b> I'd say make more of that kind of theme directed at kids. They could do what Sony did and just out right say they are hiring more women. Portal, the unexpected success with both genders, designed by a<b>  woman</b>. It would be fair to say it is possible the industry may get new IPs and genres if they had some more lady lead designers. Basically the idea is to get more girls and women interested in games, which in turn gets them interested in making games.\n\nJust saying before De Beers, diamonds were one of the more cheap gems simply because it didn't have color. Wedding rings were silver or gold only typically.\u00a0 Of men, jewelry was only ever in fashion on men of status like nobles and merchants. the average man, not so much.\n\nMarvel has been working on their lady superheroes. Adding in new ones, and changing some to be less damsel in distress. Even adding in more heroes o<b> f ethnicit</b>y with respect to their culture of origin. They are getting new readers for it, so it helps their bottom line. New Thor was a bold move. Lotta haters, but it did bring a stir to an other wise average sounding comic.\n\nI'm not demanding anything, I's saying there's money to be made, we just need companies with the balls to do it. I'm saying it would take some engineering, but there would be payoffs down the road. Too bad companies do what they do because of investors and narrow minded quarterly reports. In that, Valve has been really smart to stay a private company.",

How is the \"Damsel in Distress\" argument even still being discussed? Its a classic trope for stories about heroes, and it makes sense in terms of many villians motivations. Why is it so bad that the hero cares so much about his friend or lover, that he goes through painful level after painful level to rescue her? I think it teaches the lesson that you should help those in need of help, regardless of personal peril. At least thats what i took from all those stories. So basically this whole argument about<b>  sexism</b> in video games is fo<b> r nothin</b>g. feminists should start worrying about more important issues, like maybe how women are treated in other countries. you know, like how in muslim states, if youre a girl, and you get raped, your family can choose to MURDER you for \"shaming them\", or you can be forced to marry your rapist.

You could claim any game with character creation as games with female protags. That's a very flimsy argument when the dialog doesn't generally even reflect a change of<b>  gender</b>. Perhaps that's a good thing, but your character has no personality to give them humanity. These games aim to make the player the protag, not aim to make the protag a character. In this sense it would be the same as character creation in most MMOs and any pen and paper RPG. Self satisfaction and a blank slate to role play the character as you see fit instead of the character have his/her own identity.\n\nThe damsel in distress trope is a male empowerment story archetype that's been around for ages. Men are strong, women are weak, and it's a man's duty to protect hi<b> s woma</b>n. While there<b> 's nothi</b>ng wrong with empowering, this particular trope does it at the cost of portraying the women as trophies at worst, and weak at best. Instead of empowering both men and women by having them fight together, the man gets stronger to rescue the helpl<b> ess wo</b>man.\n\nThat last part about there being bigger issues, Fallacy of relative privation bro.

There are no Goku, Naruto, Solid Snake, Dante female equivalents in Japan. Instead we get strong, but not too strong, independent, but not too independent women as characters.

Then argue your point reasonably and clearly, without resorting to insults and broad generalizations about women being bitches etc. (like a lot of the comments on this video). It's great preaching to the choir, but if you really want to get your point across, then you have to have a non-fallacious, logically strong argument that stands up to scrutiny, one that will make the opposing argument obsolete. Maddox's Spiderwoman video is a great example of this.\n\nPlease stop legitimizing the stereotype that opponents of feminism are all immature morons. Don't give extreme feminists the ammunition or the satisfaction, and contribute constructively to the conversation :)",

Maybe you should simply scroll up and even try to edit your post so your argument can't be dispelled by simply touching the mousewheel a little.\n\nYes yes, you're a special <b> snowflake </b>that has been raped every other day, has PTSD, suffers from body dysmorphism, has 5 separate untretable cancers, lives in the ghetto under a single poor parent and has been bullied all their life, and whatever else makes you gain popularity on the internet.

If the guys are all super buff with 8 foot wide shoulders, than bikini armor isn't really a problem because it fits the rest of the universe.  However if a game has magic, but other wise is reasonably realistic, with proper proportions and realistic armor for the men, having the women use impractical revealing armor fells out of place.  People like me do not want to take away sexy girls in Dead or Alive or strip clubs in GTA, we just want games to be consistent with the rules set in their respective universes.  If head shots count as critical hits, then armor that does not properly cover ones self does not make sense in that universe.  It is especially funny that someone compared the fantasy world of Tolkien to video games, um, Tolkien had the female characters wear the same armor as their male counterparts despite the world having dragons and other unrealistic things.\nI don't really play RPGs, but from what I have seen of Skyrim (the vanilla version anyway) it seams to do pretty will with giving the female characters proper armor.\n\nI hope this is as good a the first time a wrote it, the cat jumped on the keyboard and erased everything before I could send it.",

It isn't because they actually want to play these games, they just feel these games are brainwashing us into seeing them as weaklings only good for housework, arm-candy and <b> sex.</b> You know what I say to that? Quit bitching, if it bothers you so much then join the industry and do something about it.\n\nI'm appalled at the kinds of lengths that these so called feminists are going to in order to get their way. They've already started banning games in Australia and I bet that's just the tip of the iceberg. These<b>  crazy</b> tampon feeders won't stop until all of us are stuck playing \"My Little Pony Online\", fuck that shit - I'm tempted to learn video game programming just to make <b> a sexis</b>m drenched game out of spite - just so I can show them what re<b> al sexi</b>sm looks like.\n\nAbout being given shit online for being female, everyone gets shit online and just because your version of shit seems to be centered around you bein<b> g a wo</b>man it doesn't mean that you're getting it more than anyone else, in my experience it's actually the opposite, women seem to get less shit.\n\nPeople will always give you shit and they will go for the closest pound of flesh. Women will get shit for being wo<b> men, b</b>lack people will get shit for <b> being </b>black, foreigners will get shit for being foreign, kids will get shit for being kids - that guy with the lisp will learn real fast how to talk without using \"S's\" and that shy kid with the soft voice will find his angry voice in no time - if they can't handle it, they either play single player, muted or fuck off, there's no 2ways about it.\n\nThis is why gamers are so angry about the constant feminist bitching - you walk into the community, don't like what you see and automatically assume it's because you're a girl and make a big deal about it. Man up or fuck off.\n\nThat<b>  said, </b>gender innequality is a very real issue in every day life and I whole heartedly support equal rights for all, I just don't think it applies to the video games community. Like the dude on the video said, games are made by mostly males, aimed at males, so they will be dominated by make themes. If you don't lie it then make a female version and serve it to the angry feminists and white knights and leave what we already have alone.",

In recent months, most problematic content involved Anita Sarkeesian, Brianna Wu or Zoe Quinn: a critic, and a couple indie developers - rather than AAA developers and that leads to my problem. Despite the criticism gaming receives for not including women enough, how many of those critics even acknowledge the women already working in the gaming industry? Instead, it appears that many (most) women are being ignored and their contributions dismissed as being by-products of pressure to cater to boys/men rather than an expression of their beliefs, fantasies or opinions.\n\nI mean, give these women a bit of credit, critics!",

In school, a boy could write a science fiction essay with <b> zero </b>grammatical mistake and gets failed for writing something the female teacher don't find entertaining, whilst passing the girls for their fantasy essay. That same situation applies to romance novels. We read\u00a0 them. But are they marketed to us? No. Do we cry<b>  sexism</b> because they were made by women for women? No. They target their audience and work towards that target, anyone outside their target audience buying their shit is great, but not the focus. Otherwise, the romance novel industry should stop pulling the standards they've been doing and add more stuff in the novels to cater to the male population. But no, we don't ask that, because we're not as entitled as you people who are used to having whatever you want.\n\nAlso, when men broke into magazine, they did not only broke into it in readership, they go into the industry, spend a few years going \"yes Ma'am. Right away Ma'am. Absolutely.\" (romance novel is harder to do because unless what the male writer writes makes the editor blush, the book probably won't pass) before getting their first column to write in and actually change the industry from within, while you social justice warriors spends your time moaning and bitching and demand everyone else do the changing FOR you. What the fuck? Get off your ass and go make your own games, reform the bloody gaming industry with your own two hands and stop expecting the developers who has been doing the same bloody thing for years to suddenly shift their gears because YOU want something different. Hell, the few female developers who managed to slip through the cracks and into the gaming industry make shit you don't like (but something THEY clearly proud of), you SJW crowd tore them to pieces. Don't bitch about games being made by men for men, when all you do is sit and demand, while tearing the female game designers a new one for \"betraying\" your standard feminism prerogative.",

And instead of crying about it more men gets involved with the industry, becoming an errand boy for the editors hoping they'll someday get the job to decide which book they'll publish. I'm not saying it's fine, I'm saying both side faces this problem and only one of us is crying about one side of it. I don't care about the novel thing, I brought it up to inform you of this so called \"injustice\".\n\nRomance novels are targeted towards women and have interesting male characters? You mean the over-sexualized perfect men? Yeah we call those main characters, a standard we can never hope to achieve. We have those in games too. What about you women then? Games are made by men for men, and there are female characters in games, they're strong, they're independent, a great character. But no, you women dismiss them, because they're sexy (unlike male protagonist covered with scars and tattoos and muscle-bound to hell.. oh wait.. That's sexy). Just by being sexy, they no longer count as a character and reduced to just a lewd moving pixels.\n\nSo instead of starting from the bottom, you want to skip all the hard work and get the big end game reward? Yeah, <b> nobody </b>would let me get into the parliament either. And I doubt I'd get hired into a game studio. Why? Because I didn't put in the hours of hard work that people who are in it had spent trying to get there. And honestly, most people go indie nowadays. Grab your female developers and go indie, make your games for girls, made by girls for girls. But no, you won't do it. Why?",

An objective editor (the reason why she's good at her job) picks the best materials for their target audience, which is women. I'm not gonna call it <b> sexism,</b> it's just business. Like how toys are aimed at children, sci-fi aimed at nerds. I brought it up because it's the same situation. A product aimed at certain group, developed by people of the same group. My friend sent his short story to a local magazine for 3 years, and the only story they took was the \"girliest\" one he ever written. Not discrimination, they pick materials for their target audience. As such, when I read romance novel, I don't say it's a bad book because it lacks the stuff that tickles my manly fancy. Which is the exact opposite of what feminists are doing with video games.\n\nAs for the second paragraph, I'm giving up. I'm sorry, if you think Edward, Jacob and Gray are flawed men, finely written, then it's no use for me to explain why they're not flawed. (note: If I were anyone else, instead of dismissing this paragraph, it could have been insult to you as a person instead. So don't take my dismissal as an offense.)\n\nNo, I did not say that. When you pay for your network service, do you constantly whine about having a color for the cable to match your decor? Or do you have to paint over the cables yourself? Do you demand something they do not offer to anyone? Of course not. But If I were to want my network to do stuff the ISP do not allow/provide, I will have to provide my own \"services\" to myself, meaning I'll have to do what ISPs had done all over again (the cables, infrastructure, the servers), but with my own twist (no logs, dynamic ip, masked). And there ARE positive role models for females. Bayonetta, Croft, Aran, some NPC in the witcher I can't remember her name (but she was great. Kind, caring, daring, becoming a traveling healer and can kick ass.) But people refuse to acknowledge them as a \"person\" because they are sexualized, like male protagonists in games and other mediums (but it's fine, just because).\u00a0\n\nAs a gamer, you get what's on the shelf, like male gamers, except what's on the shelf is aimed at males. I wanted sandbox mmorpg with fluid character creation and no<b>  gender</b> designation, just a body shape you manipulate to get body that appeals to you. And the game is completely player-driven, set in fantasy or steampunk, with action based twitch reflex combat system. But no. I won't get any of that unless I ditch my gamer tag and go through the hardwork of other developers had gone through, earn that developer tag and make the game that I want. You seem to think that being a customer of a certain thing for an extended amount of time warrants a special recognition. It doesn't. The games weren't aimed at men because we've been the longest customer. Hell, most games nowadays even went as far as casting away their hardcore long-time patreons in favor of accessibility and wider audience. They have no sense of \"loyalty\" to reward any of us for being a long-time regulars. So 50% of gamers being women doesn't really mean anything. Actually, if you twist their logic a bit, you can see it as a good thing. \"We made this for dudes. but 50% of our customers are chicks. Wow. Let's keep this up.\" Because that's like 100% increase than their intended target.",

It's as if I, as a man who listens to metal music, demands from a hiphop-magazine to publish more metal-related articles.I'm not part of the target group, and I'm totally fine with that, regardless I may read the magazines, but it's not my part to complain to the producers of the magazine that they are not appealing to me.I can go buy a metal magazine, or if i think that there is no good magazine at the moment I can try to make one my one, but I have no right to demand others to bend to my will, and I have accepted this circumstance.\nTo end this discussion, I guess more people need to start to re-evaluate their point of view, look at it from the other side for a moment and to stop pushing others to obey their will, especially seing that this is a real first world problem here.",

The games are targeted at men, like dog food is targeted for dogs, even if a cat could theoratically eat dog food, cats aren't the targeted consumer group.Changing the dog food to be more like cat food, because cat owners complain about it, won't happen.\nIf 50% of dog food is sold to cat owners, the producers of the food won't change what they are doing.Never change a running system. right now they are selling their product to a lot of people, so what they are doing works perfectly out for them, and there is <b> nothing </b>wrong with that.\nI only repeat what i said earlier, a consumer has no right to force a producer to change his product, the only right a consumer has is to decide wether he's buying the product, accepting what it is, or not to buy said product and go with something else instead.\nYou can still wish for a perfect game for you, like I wish for a good Final Fantasy, or like children wish for a new bike, but that's just a little personal wish, and no justification to order others around.",

You can't tell them \"I want this!\" then throw a hissy fit when you don't get it. What you\u00a0CAN do is express interest and if they think it will be profitable THEY WILL PROVIDE. You keep throwing around this statistic that 50% of gamers are girls, as statistic I've never seen and frankly don't believe. The highest claim I've heard is 40%, and even that is deceiving because of how they define \"gamer.\" You want me to believe your stat, provide a link. And be warned: if it's a poorly done study I will tear it apart so you can see why. Although, stating how what proportion of those who identify as a \"gamer\" doesn't actually give a clear indication to how much weight developers should give to the demands of \"girl gamers.\" What WOULD help is showing how much of their revenue comes from females. And I sincerely doubt that is anywhere near 50%.\u00a0\n\nBut whatever the proportion is, the facts are as follows:\u00a0we female gamers are still buying the stuff they're making, still loving it, and still asking for more. Would I love to see more female protaganists? Sure! But guess what? I'm not going to buy a game just cause the lead character is a girl. Likewise, I'm not going to refuse to buy a game because the lead character is a guy. Do I expect developers to\u00a0cater to a want that I'm not going to back with money? Nope.\u00a0In addition, people act like all female character suck and all male characters are awesome. My lengthy experience with games is that there are a wide range of characters male and female with a wide range of skills and personality traits. I'd say the ratio of good female characters to bad female characters is roughly the same as the ratio of good male characters to bad male characters. So why are so many people acting like girls are getting the shaft? We really aren't. So there are more male main characters. yawn I don't care. I love playing them anyway.\n\nOh yeah, and game developers? Keep it up with the sexy white haired guys. XD See? Girls can objectify too.",

If the female mage in a game is a busty young<b>  woman</b>, it's marketing to lure people into playing the game, straight men and lesbians alike. If the female character is a bad character, that's no<b> t sexis</b>m either, it's bad writing. Even if all female characters are bad, it's mostly due to the inability to write good female characters.\nIf, for example, the female, playable character was weaker than the male one, just because it's a female character, then it would be sexist.\nIf the female character is sexy, it's not. If she's blend or uninteresting it's not.\nTo conclude, actua<b> l\u00a0 sexi</b>sm in videogames is rare, agressive marketing on the other hand<b>  is com</b>mon - and not a bad thing, just a cheap trick.I never played a rpg where the female characters were weaker due to t<b> heir ge</b>nder, or where playing a female was harder, because Npc's treated you differently, and I'd be impressd if you could list even 3 games that had actual sexist contents (and just to stop you at this spot, neither Duke Nukem, nor GTA are seriously sexist games. Duke Nukem is a parody of a sexist, and GTA is social-critical game.

                    "commentText": "@Shay Price\u00a0Lord\u00a0Hidious's first reply to your reply to my reply says most of what I would have said\u00a0so I won't bother repeating. However, there are a few things I would like to add.\n\nFirst of all, you are the one strawmanning here. I say that we need to see what proportion of\u00a0video game revenue comes from females and you tell me that 50% of the worlds buying power comes from females. Since proportion of females who buy video games =/= proportion of females who buy stuff that is a strawman argument (Lord\u00a0 Hidious brought this up, I just wanted to point out the hypocrisy). If you don't understand what a strawman argument is, then here is a link:  [LINK] \n\nSecondly, there's another reason I don't do you source citations for you. My google search will throw up 5 million unreliable sources\u00a0 regardless of whether or not the original data is true. I'm not going to evaluate each and every source (who would?) so if you have a reliable\u00a0one, share. Or would you prefer that I simply pick the top one and tell you why that one is unreliable?\n\nThird: \"We also know that in sales \u00a0mobile/app games and Nintendo are doing very well, both genre's or company's that target female-friendly content.\" There are so many problems with this one sentence-- in addition to more strawmanning -- that I've made a numbered list. 1)\u00a0Nintendo is not free of the accusations of <b> sexism </b>(Bayonetta 2 anyone?). 2) Sales of female friendly games are high. So are sales of non-female friendly games. This proves<b>  nothing</b>. 3) Many mobile games don't actually have characters or have non-gendered character (i.e. Flappy Bird). They don't have sexist content because they don't hav<b> e se</b>x. 4) You are again assuming that the lack of sexist content has boosted these sales. It is entirely possible that the sales would be the same even if they did have sexist content. In statistics terms the null hypothesis is \"A negative\u00a0portrayal of women in video games has no effect on game sales.\" The alternative hypothesis would be \"A negative portrayal of women in video games has a negative impact on game sales.\" You would then have to show that games wi<b> th sexi</b>sm against women have a statistically significant reduction in sales. Oh, and don't forget to control for confounding factors such as game price, genre, and which devices the games are available on.\n\nLast: My last comment --\u00a0in addition to being primarily a joke, as indicated by the silly emoticon -- did not say anything about any systematic issues. I did not say \"women objectify as much as men.\" I did not say \"men's objectification is not an issue.\" (Though to be frank\u00a0I believe the vast majority of objectification is completely harmless and doesn't lead to real-world abuse) I honestly have no idea what you thought I was saying about which supposed systematic issue, nor do I know what it is you think I was strawmanning. In fact, I don't think you actually know what a strawman is. The comment was a simple statement of fact. I a<b> m a wo</b>man. I occasionally objectify men. Therefore women can objectify. That was all.",

But the more I learn the more I realize how untrustworthy much of the mainstream media is. Over the past 6 months I've become highly skeptical of a lot of statistics being thrown around especially in regards to feminism. Their main talking points recently -- such as the wage gap or <b> sexual </b>assault -- have proven to be from extremely faulty studies.\u00a0For me personally, one of the greatest benefits to come from the Tropes vs. Women and gamergate controversies is that they led me to discover Christina Hoff Sommers AKA the factual feminist. She is a godsend to statistically-minded people looking into<b>  gender</b> equality because she understands what makes a reliable study, what doesn't, and when people are being misleading by comparing apples and oranges or coming to conclusions not supported by the data. On top of that she is also rational, reasonable, and doesn't view the world through a lens of \"male oppression.\" I strongly recommend you watch a few a her videos, about video games or other topics. Even if you don't agree with her conclusions I think you'll learn a thing or two about empirical evidence and how people use statistics incorrectly to deceive.\nAlso, while some feminists tell us to \"listen and believe\" which boils down to \"trust us blindly,\" Sommers encourages fact-checking and critical thinking -- an approach that I find infinitely more agreeable.",

It's one thing to engage in a culture where women are viewed as inferior and another to pretend that we're capitalist islands. Most Japanese tend to view ills as culture/ society-based rather than the individual. . \"\n\nI have been there to and agrees and thinks it's because of they being more open in there views. And i don't see the point of the rest of your comment as i have made no such claims.\n\n\"When you regulate the market.

I've visited third world nations where the free market exists and everything ( including children) have a damn price.\"\n\nof course it's a free market, just as we have a free society, even tho we do not have anarchism. And what kind of restrictions do we have in the gaming market? exempt child molesting.\u00a0\n\n\"The innovation that we see in the gaming industry is really the result of a framework that includes a lot of lawyers, government subsidies and even more government.

This mechanism of innovation creation is why Boeing outsources composite material production from India's government-owned HAL. Similarly, it's also why Intel outsources chip design from Israel thanks to highly subsidised micro-electronic space that is tied to an indigenous military industry. \"\n\n\u00a0And this hav<b> e nothin</b>g to do with the gaming industry. and you can't outsource gaming, it would be like outsourcing people to do a painting. your comparing apples and horses.\nThis haven't happened to the industry\n\n\"Nevertheless, this wouldn't arise in free market Mauritania \u00a0where education, industry ( never mind technology development) are subsidised.

There is a reason why Austrian economics are considered crack pots by the vast majority economists. When Austrian Schumpeter proved the primacy of impure monopolistic markets, he essentially stated that the formation of STATE instruments far exceed the decentralised \"stateless\" free market variety. \"\u00a0\n\nYou do understand that economics are<b>  not b</b>lack and white? And how is the competition not pure? there is only the core they compeat about.\n\n\"Competition, by the way, predates capitalism itself. It's not like people weren't having friendly, non-profit, competition before the advent of private property which is when capitalism began. Point being, there really is no need to conflate competition with \"free markets\" especially considering that we do NOT live in a free market economy.\"\u00a0\n\nNot necessarily true. Capitalism is only the idea to get a profit, a surplus of what you exchanged and have existed since man have exchanged goods. And what does your point have to do with the gaming industry? And if you don't have a free market then you can't have competition, as the market would not decide.\n\n\"We live in a command economy where government-mandated enterprises called corporations exist. Hell, even the Soviet Union had family-run or group-run enterprises. For instance, Kazan Aircraft Production Association was a production enterprise that was granted a lot of independence. After all, government officials wouldn't know jack shit about building aircrafts never mind engine design. Speaking of engines, how many nations are actually self-sufficient in that area? Pfft...free markets. \"\n\nNo we are living in a mixed economy. economy i<b> s not </b>black and white, there hell of a lot of gray. And no private corporations are not mandated by the government, they are following game rules to prevent abuse.\n\n\"You need to understand that not all capitalism is free market-based. The bastardisation of that expression is really something that arisen out of Pax Americanism. Now if one were to speak to the American founding fathers ( wh<b> en the </b>nation was undeveloped), most would consider free market economics as anti-industrial. \"\n\ni don't know of any current country using capitalism with out a free market. and the industry during the founding fathers was very much a free market capitalism compared to todays america\n\n\"How is providing subsidies th<b> at have </b>NOTHING to do with the current crop hindering freedom of speech?

You need to enable some parity with government intervention ( i.e. subsidies, tax credits, socialised inputs, etc). \"\n\nso what more can they compete with? these are the only factors that matters to the market.\n\n\"Then stop fucking using the term free market.

This was the case even though British imports was generating a large share of government revenue due to being a former colony. The US establishment essentially pushed for trade barriers ( high tariffs), central banking to control capital formation, all that was done in order to cultivate the US industry. Otherwise, US would've been destroyed by the more competitive British industries that were dumping goods into the<b>  nation</b>. \"\n\nThe domestic market was favored yes, but still much more open the today, compared to barely having any regulations then.\n\n\"Let's remember NAFTA was only introduced very recently.

The idea of free market is a marketing term which refers to a pure competition market. It's a fucking myth even though people can \"freely\" buy crap. Hell, people could even \"freely\" buy crap in the Soviet Union since family-based, co-op, group enterprises existed.

After all, US had to compete with more productive European players. This meant protectionism, subsidies and evne more protectionism. Remember socialised inputs like education, etc are not available in all nations. \"\n\nWhat stops you from going to the library, or the internet? \u00a0the fact that you have access to education is not related to the free market and not needed to create games.\u00a0\n\n\" My point is that incentives to broaden women start ups can be considered. As for why, it probably has to do with women being a lot less competitive than men. Think of men being the British industry while women are more like early pre-industrial America. The playing field is hardly equal and it's one of the reasons why women still play a very nominal role in entertainment in general. \"\n<b> \nwoman</b> graduates in a higher degree then men, the fact that they are not interested is there problem, all subsidies exist equal for every man an<b> d woma</b>n nine every country, they are n<b> ot gend</b>er specific exist and they shall not get privileges because they have a vagina. IF they do not want to compete then thats a problem they will have to fix.\u00a0\n\n\n\" Subsidies including tax credits probably won't ever be removed. In cases where they are, firms just end up firing workers. In a high rick creative sector, one needs to subsidise the start up costs. If anything, it probably requires more subsidies.

How do most of the technological innovations arise? Even if we ignore the dominant state sector ( basic science research), there is technology generated by corporate monopolies themselves. Then let's remember the education, the infrastructure ( power generation, etc) that is required. \"\n\nyour labeling about stuff not relevant to the free market. Where you buy your toilet is irrelevant . What does technology have to do with it? and monopolies? infrastructure? educatio<b> n?\n\nNoth</b>ing of that is required. you can create your own shit if you want to.\n\n\n\" A free market is a pure competitive market. It would mean that all the inputs ( labour, infrastructure, technology, etc) would have to materialise within a profit-based competitive market. This isn't just the case in terms of the infrastructure inputs, but even with open technologies itself. <b> It's co</b>mmon to mix up bartering economics ( non-profit) with the capitalist free market which MUST be profit-based, but they're not the same. \"\n\nNo that is not true. A competing market is not defined by it's third party inputs. you have no regulations on you. The state hinders you in no way to create a game,\n\n\" When incorporated, the gaming market will obviously be generally regulated. There is no need to regulate the gaming market directly because it is entertainment. Nevertheless, all businesses depend heavily on a strong contract law framework. You have intellectual property which will apart in a future taking us further away from the capitalist \"free market\". \"\n\nstill not true in the slightest, as it's not regulated in the slightest. not directly or indirectly. And no they do not rely heavily on \" contract law framework \" at all.\u00a0\nAnd how is intellectual property relevant? you can do a carbon copy of what ever game you want.\n\n\" *It's also handy if the infrastructure and inputs used are tightly regulated. Otherwise you'll see the same mess that's seen in neo-liberal Chile with their for-profit schools, shoddy infrastructure ( i.e. power) which is hardly the environment suitable for game development. * \"\n\nnope, the market takes care of it self",

We're talking about judicial regulation that adds complexity to a pure competitive environment. After all corporations are meant to be legal persons with similar responsibilities despite being limited liability vehicles. \"\n\nCorporations known ass private entities. And no, Corperations have no legal responsibilities , and only country i know trying to make companies to people are USA.\n\n\" Think of it this way, corporations are really only allowed to make profit in a very well-defined manner. You have lawyers involved in all corporations for that matter. Most who invest know that contracts are an added complexity that REDUCES profit margins but it's done - ideally - for the greater good. \"\n\nThat is only true for some companies in DIFRENT markets, game companies have NO law that they can break.. And lawyers \u00a0makes no difference on a Not/free Market. Are you forced to make contracts? no , and investors hinders <b> nothing </b>and if as a person wants to give you money i may have some things i want you to do. Free market still.\n\n\n\" Free market entails surplus generation under a pure competitive model. If that doesn't follow, the free market does NOT exist. It would require a for-profit environment because that's what free markets promise. It states in some government-free paradise, enterprise will magically arise. The problem with that thinking is that the entire technology sector sprang out of the loss-producing dynamic state sector. The labour input also comes out of a non-profit education sector. \"\n\nYou are mixing allot of things up, a free market can exist together with a mixed market, \u00a0And they may or may not interact with each other. that means<b>  nothing</b> to the free market as it's not regulated by it. and a free market say<b> s nothin</b>g ability only being a surplus generated. who decides the free market of paintings?\n\n\" Moreover, the same open technologies extensively used in gaming market is NOT profit-oriented. In other words, we're not talking about profit-oriented pure competitive markets when we're dealing with OpenGL for instance. Even the Direct3D competitor which has now become dominant in the PC realm is an example of explicitly non-competitive behavior. This even is more obvious in the gaming realm were licensing fees and what not exist. \"\n\nof course we are, because it's not profit orientated mea<b> ns nothi</b>ng, and thy are founded by other companies \u00a0cooperating with each other in a\u00a0Consortium. and direct3D is an arbitrary standard made by microsoft a private company in the free market, and how is this a non competitive behavior? why do you think they did this, for the good of there hearts? no, because it makes profit easier to earn. and in a free market competition will promote a handful of winners becoming the standard of the industry. And did microsoft win or OpenGl?\n\n\" Having said that, how the fuck can any of that even represent the free market? The computer, microprocessors, VGA, OpenGL, Direct3D...all of it arose form a partnership between the dynamic state sector and government-sponsored private monopolies such as IBM. This was pretty clear when IBM and MIT first partnered up. In other words, all we see is NON-PROFIT state-sponsored monopolies ( private or otherwise) and open standards. \"\u00a0\n\nNo monopolies are sponsored by the states, and how is this relevant to games? where computers made by gamers for gamers? And Direct3D is not sponsored by anyone exempt microsoft it self.\n\n\" Furthermore, why are you conflating competition with the free market? Competition obviously even existed before for-profit capitalism. Agriculture didn't even sustain surplus for most of history but competition obviously existed. Otherwise, our cultures wouldn't be so diverse. Likewise, it was quite fierce in the Soviet Union otherwise it wouldn't be possible for a backward, German-dominated, agrarian land to one that was designing space vehicles. The difference here is that alternative models understand that to generate systems that produce surplus will contain non-competitive elements. \"\n\nNo it did not, capitalism have existed ever since man exchanged goods. capitalism only means to make profit in it's basic form. And what happened when agriculture could not generate a surplus? absolut<b> ely noth</b>ing, and when it started to make a \"profit\" our development boomed. \u00a0The rest is not relevant for the current discussion.\u00a0\n\n\" Pure competition does NOT produce complexity. It is impure competition adds complexity - reducing short-term profit \u00a0- in order to achieve goals. We understand that losses are going to be made. That's why legal, state complexities not to mention the subsidies themselves exist. It explains why nations that entered into the video game industry after the United States had to provide even more significant subsidies in order to utilise development talent. It would be naive to think that these industries just arise ou<b> t of not</b>hing. \"\n\nPure competition creates the most amount of complexity you can imagine, that is why regulation is normal needed.\u00a0And unregulated market will have a hard time making any kind of profit still it regulates it self with the gaming market have done. it existed thousands upon thousands of different gaming companies competing for the market, in the end only a few prevailed and others merged to survive.\u00a0\nAnd why are you talking about countries? countries did not enter the gaming market, and governments did not care for the gaming market until recently.\u00a0\n\n\nAgain, what stopped Minecraft and Doom to be created and become so successful? i guarantee that they had no subsidies, NO regulation<b> s and no</b>thing but the marked consumer decided the success.",

And the thing is, the makers of casual and social games are rarely the ones being called out as sexist, nor are they the ones that the \"50% of gamers are women\" statistics are being parroted towards. King Games, for example, might be well-renowned for vile business practices and legal wrangling, but they aren't widely cited as misogynists or for degrading women.\n\nOn the other hand, when examining shooters, RPGs, racing games, sports games, strategy games.... basically, any of the types of games that the AAA studios would be making, the player demographics are overwhelmingly male even to this day. Misquoting statistics will not change this fact, and frankly, the AAA studios are not so immensely stupid as to radically change their entire production and marketing setup on the basis of some unsourced or misquoted statistic which doesn't match their own, or their publisher's, marketing research as to what their player demographics are.\n\nAnd what the actual, non-agenda-pushing research shows is about the polar opposite of the story you are telling. For example, let's look at some marketing data on the Devil May Cry series:\n [LINK] \n\nNote that not only did males make up 78% of the player base, but males aged 15 to 19 (28%) outnumbered the entirety of the female player base (22%).\n\nSo, yes, as long as the \"teenage boy\" demographic by itself continues to be larger than the \"women of all ages\" demographic for the types of games being made by AAA studios, you can bet your stock portfolio that the AAA studios will be catering primarily towards male gamers -- because it's the obviously profitable course for them. And, again, this is not something that will get changed by complaining at the developers; if you want change, then it will have to come from either breaking into the development side of things by making the types of games you want and showing that they can be profitable, or from the player side by getting enough women into gaming-as-a-primary-hobby / \"core gaming\" that they legitimately make up a large portion of the player base for big game developers.",

And what is not right about them?\n\nYou are complaining that AAA studios are supposedly ignoring their allegedly large female player demographic, and yet you have not even demonstrated that it exists as a core demographic. You then dismiss hard numbers on the player demographics for a fairly typical AAA title as \"not being right either\", without bothering to elaborate on what is \"not right\" about them. Do note that, between the two of us, I'm the only one who has so far cited any statistics here to support their argument, so you aren't exactly making yourself look good.\n\n\n\"I could say look at this AAA title World Of Warcraft where <b> woman </b>lead over men in terms of hours played and by<b>  age</b> demographics in all but the younger two.\"\n\nYes, you could say that. The point, however, which seems to be flying miles above your head, is can you back it up? Demographic data on WoW is very limited, but everything I've seen suggests that the player base is between 10% and 25% female, depending on the global region you are looking at. Again, that's a far cry from the unsourced female majority claim you are making.\n\n\nSo, at this point, I have to ask: What is it you are hoping to accomplish?\n\nAre you trying to change AAA titles? Then, as I said before, misquoting statistics, tossing around bad statistics, and otherwise trying to deny reality isn't going to help; at best, it will get you ignored, at worst, it will actively hurt your goal by making the other people arguing for it look like fools by association. Change is not going to come from non-AAA gamers complaining to the AAA studios, nor from attempts to mislead AAA studios about who is actually playing their games. Simply stated: They aren't stupid enough to fall for such obvious tricks, and they are too profit-driven to take such a large risk when they are doing fine with the status quo.",

I have actually (as in factually) been accused of that multiple times although simply not true.\nand so what if people question that you have played games? does that suddenly stop you from playing games? and this happens a lot of times to guys, not as common; but that is for the reason of girls 'never' played as much as guys did in the early days. But then again your talking about the culture, we discussed the games\n\nOff topic\nYet I've never rebutted with or seen a <b> woman </b>accuse a man of the same.<b>  Gender</b>-based issue. this is a personal issue, not <b> a gende</b>r issue. as why should peoples 'belief' in your gami<b> ng <b> r</b</b>>ed matter to you? prove them wrong and they will shut up, unless trolls; then ignore. not seeing it docent mean it exist(especially as it's online) and I have accused many gamers if they are even real gamers online, you know what that is known as? trash talk\n\nOff topic\nSo sense we can no longer nonfactualy accuse me of not knowing games,\nI have not made any such accusation to you.\n\n\u00a0*lets rewind and go back to facts, lot<b> s of w</b>oman play video games, lo<b> ts of </b>woman dislike t<b> he way</b> woman are represented, experts in various fields have said this is because of nega<b> tive</b> or old stereotypes.*\nCitation needed.\n\nYou also understand this is a Emotional fallacy ? notice the word 'Dislike'\n\nGaming companies have in the past even admitted this being the reason, despite positive role models being linked to success or failure in female children\nCan you tell me games made for children. And is it not the companies fault if they fail to sell there own game? How is this relevant?\nP.S a lot of great childrens games are genderless(little big planet, pinjata)\u00a0\n\nOff topic\nand lastly some men<b>  who s</b>ee woman saying she plays games will \u00a0try to make her prove it although if she was a male or anonymous they wouldn't Do you have to prove anything?\nis he holding a gun to your head? or can you just mute him and T-bag him?\n\n\nThose are facts with various reasons and statistics that go along with them. If YOU personally feel like they are not problem that it subject to debate but \u00a0their existence is FACT. You might feel that video games are an art form or male space, but that doesn't remove those\n\nyou have only argued emotional appeal(exempt two) and you are talking about the gaming community, this is a different discussion.\nI asked you about problems with in GAMES\naka video games, Console games, hand held games, PC games, not the community",

This <b> red<b>  </b</b>>flag immediately leads me to assume that you are delusional and don't know how real life works.\n\nMoreover, the excuse \"if you want it to change, shut up and make video games\" is a moot argument. Yes, women could sacrifice doing what they prefer to do to create games they enjoy as hobbies, but that's just unrealistic for the majority of women who don't have a passion for creating video game content. Consumers' voices matter and are regularly catered to in video games by video game developers. Feedback helps tremendously. Would you tell a male gamer who suggests there should be more interactive content or more blah blah blah to STFU and go make a video game? No, you probably wouldn't. In fact, you'd probably think that kid is just giving a helpful suggestion that perhaps video game developers would add into the game. But when <b> a woma</b>n suggests practical armor or more representation in games, all the sudden it's forbidden territory. Yeah, I get it, boys only care about other dicks, but the gaming community doesn't consist of just dicks anymore. Women are just as much consumers as you are. Accept it.\n\nGames were originally targeted to solely males and now they're not. Women like to play video games, so we want to be represented in more meaningful ways. Moreover, if video game developers wanted to make the most money, wouldn't it be wise if they made games that attracted BOTH men and women? Yes, yes it would be.",

I'm not even talking about the 'sexualized' female characters. Has anyone actually noticed that men are \"sexualized\" as well? When was the last time you saw a dude built like Chris Redfield? or looking like a Snow Villiers? The reason: Characters need to be idealized! For Hundreds of years, when has society told stories about the average joe? Legends are based upon the Ideal, not the average.\u00a0\n\nHow about a particularly interesting thing? How many men complain about the idealized (sexualized) men presented in media? How many women complain about the idealized (sexualized) women presented in media? Don't misunderstand! I'm not saying all women do, nor am I saying only women do. If men complain about it, I have not seen them voice it. But how many women have the reaction most men do for their idealized counterpart? The reaction being admiration/Jealousy. Personally, I am jealous about how amazing the characters are in video games. Don't all men wish they could be the unstoppable powerhouse from their videogames? But how many women have you seen show pure admiration for their counterparts? Once again, I am not saying all women don't have any admiration. It's more of the idea that one <b> gender </b>either voices their disagreement with the idealized, or that one<b>  gender</b> simply differs in reaction in generation.\n\nBut here is a question I have: Are those having complaints simply the minority?",

People who are privileged (as are white males in video games) don't realize they aren't being inclusive since everything is fine from their perspective, they're just making characters.

If I had done that intentionally, you'd have a point. I didn't, which is why I asked what you meant originally so I can address that rather than my misconception. I didn't ask you what a strawman was.\u00a0Simply stating that what I did was a fallacy, and so is wrong, is a fallacy itself (the 'argument from fallacy' or 'fallacy fallacy').\n\n\"You are to stupid to see that.\"\nNice insult. Good to know I don't necessarily have to be polite to you in this conversation.\n\n\"Where did I bring up quotas.\"\nWhen did I bring up quotas? I was addressing you saying that we need more men in particular jobs. Neither of us said quotas, though as you demonstrated, saying that we 'need' more of something implies them. If you had said \"I think we should have more\" then that would have just been an opinion, and I'd likely never would have said anything.\n\n\"Preventing yes still in military.\"\nRather broad brush there. Presuming you're talking about the US military (admittedly a bit of an assumption) there's been movement to fix that. I've heard that in at least one EU <b> nation,</b> they've already passed a law mandating women serve the as men. In some cases though, such as with regards to special forces units or officer positions, the 'prevention' has been due to the women in question failing to meet various standards, especially fitness standards, at which point you'd have to argue things like 'is biology fair' and 'is holding both men and women to the same high standards fair'. But I'm not going to argue about that, because that might get me attacked for possibly making another strawman.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make right here is that for the most part, women aren't prevented from doing the vast majority of things out there that men are allowed to, and the things they aren't are being rectified. Which is why in my first post, I specifically said if <b> \"nobody</b> is preventing them from entering an area\". Obviously if they are, there's a problem. The same problem if men are prevented. Or Hispanics. Or Asians. Or Irish. Or any other arbitrary distinction.\n\n\"In some jobs women don't get fair treatment in.\"\nIf that's true, then that's against most laws regardin<b> g gende</b>r equality in the US, and likely Europe as well I would imagine. The 1964 Civil Rights act was specifically written to prevent unequal treatment regardless <b> of ra</b><b> ce, gen</b>der, etc (though an argument can be made that later laws, and recommendations made by the Civil Rights Commission, pushed the balance too far in the opposite direction. I haven't actually looked into that assertion much, so I can't really argue that one way or another here)\n\n\nAlso, this is all funny because your original post didn't say anything about women. It was about more men 'needing' to be in jobs that are 'women's jobs'. And I specifically left women out of my original reply because I wanted to focus on and dispute the general concept.",

Gamers are not \"offended\" by the word \"feminism\"....they just remember how much so called \"feminists\" who are just populists waging war on the games industry are continueing stereotyping the gamer communities. \"They are just women-hating psychotic giant-babies\" and so forth.\nSo far the only \"feminists\" gaming communities have came in contact with in connection with games are not of the actual \"feminist\" kind and more of the \"hey let's just attack the group that just recovered from the \"killergame\"-debate, spread bullshit and make money of it\"\n\nSo far the gaming industry hasn't come in contact with \"real\" feminists and only with some maniacs or cons. It's like if the first clown you've ever saw killed your dog and now you have some issue with them.\n\nYou can't really blame the game communities for that, the real question is: Why don't actual feminists enter that talk and spank these pseudo-intellectuals a bit that drag down the movement's name and create a better relationship? For instance: The gaming industry AND the internet communities have reacted quite positively towards emma watson's speak AND other more objective feminists as opposed to people like Sarkeesian.\u00a0\n\n2. The game boy has <b> nothing </b>to do with IT being only for BOYS.....thats the name of the OBJECT and it was ment to somehow personalize the console itself and not make it sound tooo techy and it had to be speakable for everyone The original work-title was:<b>  Dot</b> Matrix Game. It's a fun little boy that you play games on. It was not just intended for gamers, but for people who normaly DIDN'T play games. Hence the \"friendly\" name that rolls easily out of your tongue.\n\n3. The working conditions in the industry are bad and the requirements are high. Yes. And industries who have those are often very male-dominated, especially considering the even worse conditions during crunch-time and that its not a stable occupation and you can end up jobless for months/years without warning in addition to bad payment.\n\nUnless the industry starts to organize itself a bit and sets itself some standards, maybe even some unions things won't change very quickly. They WILL change nonetheless because th<b> e ol</b>d scumbags running their companies like coal-mines will eventually die out.\n\nEspecially considering new investment-opportunities.",

I would love to make video games with strong female characters, but I can only make female characters based upon my own view and experience and what I think makes someone \"strong\", which should explain to you why many female characters are just males with breasts or overly girly in some form.. because males created something THEY thought is powerfull and made it female or rather \"how they wanted strong women to be\".\n\nAnd ofc that lead to a misrepresentation of female struggles in video game characters: Because male developers only ever experienced MALE struggles.\n\nA good studio can get you good storytellers and character designers etc., but the majority is average and below.\n\nSo yeah: If you want \"truly\" representive female characters to be more common: You have to do that yourself.",

Which, thanks to the online-game, f2p and casual-industry growing is something that has become desirable more and more.\n\nThe only market where it hasn't been done is the \"oldest\" one, which is sadly often infested with a bunch of risk-hating <b> old </b>farts in leading positions who \"doesn't think it feels right to the player\" to play a female characters.\n\nIts called \"conservative\".

I'm doing it right now\n\nGood for you! \u00a0I hope you do well.\n\nIt's not that easy for many girls when they grow up in a world that keeps telling them where we should belong and what we should like.\n\nAnd.... men don't get told where they should belong or what they should be like? \u00a0They most certainly do, and it's not easy for them either. \u00a0Grass is greener, and all that....\n\nI've been told contantly that games are for boys, adults would deny when I asked if I could have stuff they thought were for boys, like radio-controlled cars and a (game\"boy\"). I never got them, all I got was fake barbies and fake kitchen kit.\n\nYour parents sucked then. \u00a0I remember when I was 5, I asked for this really amazing huge-ass dollhouse for my birthday. \u00a0Thing was taller than I was, really detailed craftsmanship, had working doors inside, even an attic-ladder that came down out of the hallway ceiling, the windows were all real glass and opened and closed. \u00a0Even little lights that actually lit up. \u00a0I didn't get it either. \u00a0It sucks being a kid sometimes, but we move on. \u00a0Or we should at least.\n\nI\u00a0just don't get why some games like to sexualize women.\n\nSame reason some sexualize men. \u00a0Same reason some sexualize both genders. \u00a0Same reason some sexualize inanimate objects. \u00a0Same reason some games sexualize <b> nothing.</b> \u00a0Same reason some games have puzzles and some don't. \u00a0Everybody has different tastes and wants to play different types of games.\n\nThis is really not a bad thing.\n\nAre men that desperate to see women with no brain and big boobs in games.\n\nDesperate? No. \u00a0But I, as a male, do like seeing big boobs. \u00a0So what? \u00a0What do you have against boobs? \u00a0They are perfectly natural, half the human population has them.... er, actually a good bit more than that, but manboobs aren't as aesthetically pleasing to most people.\n\nI'm not saying all men ofcourse, but isn't it degrading to men when the game companies assume that men want that?\n\nNo. \u00a0When they put out a game with something we don't like..... we don't buy it. \u00a0We are not obligated to buy any game. If my neighbor wants to buy and play \"BigBoobz Volleyball: Extreme Nakedness Edition\".... go for it, slugger!\n\nI would not particularly be interested in that game.... so I don't buy it. \u00a0My neighbor's happy, I'm happy... I'm probably even happier because I still have 50 bucks to go buy a game that I DO want to play.\n\n*It's so<b>  weird</b> when real women dress really revealing we get a lot of hate, for looking like a whore. *\n\nLIfe tip.... there is always going to be somebody that hates you for something. \u00a0Always.\n\nThat's life.... it's either the religious fucktard down the street who screams about hell and brimstone \u00a0when he sees you in that sinful pair of jeans instead of a dress or burka, or it's the neighbor down the street who hates you because she thinks you're far more beautiful than she is, or it's the cashier at the supermarket who hates you because that one week you had a really bad day and practically threw the money at him and gave him attitude, and you forgot to apologize the next day....\n\nIf you honestly think you're going to please everybody all the time and not have someone hate you.... uh.... good luck with that!",

Good luck with your game, I have been worked on games before (pixel art and animation) and its really lot of work with no help (you need to figure out everything by yourself when you start).\n\n2. Adult telling kids how they must behave is not new and neither is the video game industry at fault, its more your own experience rather a social conspiracy. And if anything, you see this problem changing, regardless of feminist or egalitarian ideologies, new generations are aware of this problem and behave accordingly.\n\n3. Gameboys name was intentional as it was targeted to kids. A easy way for adults to remember the name of the product (as you must know, many adults would still call a ps4, nintendo) and the target demography the product was meant to be, and you can't blame them as it was a risky product on the west and nintendo consoles were mostly played by male kids. It wasn't until later with gameboy advance that nintendo saw female consumers, reason why they droppped the \"boy\" on nintendo ds. So they listen when money is on the table (as any industry does).\n\n4. Men are as desperated for women with no brain and big boobs as women are for men with abds and half naked. <b> Sex </b>sells, in both ways (just look at marvel movies, look how many half naked dudes you are); but here is the trick, companies listen where money is placed, and as the video game industry is growing more wider demographics appear, so you will end up with games selling to people wanting for smart characters or not soo good looking.\n\nBut I question the aggressiveness of your statements, from looking down to men, to victimizing the female position. So is there any reason of the bitterness of your comment? Because most of your complains can be explained by marketing reasons.",

Fact is \u00a0the\"Remember Me\"- developers worked really hard on getting their protagonist to be a women....they released it, it was a risk,but people didn't seem to care at all.\n\nPeople were demanding harder games for years with the \"casual\"-waves around. It was only when the Soul-Series became that big that developers had an easier time getting decent difficulties in games through.\n\nI have the same issue: My boss wants \"casual casual casual\" which is absolute bullshit for our main audience, Why? Because thats what investors think is the lowest risk....\n\nThe community demands more difficulty/challenge but he isn't listening because he only looks for the money and possible \"wider\" audience.\n\nBelieve me: Investors don't care that much about what people actually want. They care about what brings the lowest risk/highest chance of success.\n\nSo no: Demanding more female protagonists with your mouth doesn't change a lot. You have to demand it with your wallet. \u00a0If \"Remember Me\" would have been successfull, or gotten some support Ubisoft wouldn't be opposed to making more female protagonists. But it wasn't successfull, it didn't get support so chances are Ubisoft will not try that again soon.\n\nThis is why I critizise populists/ \"femnisists\" in gaming: They only complain about what is wrong and don't support what is right.\u00a0\n\nAnd as a game designer, let me tell you one thing about feedback/reward-systems: Negative Feedback on Faults works far less effective than positive Feedback on doing things RIGHT:\n\nSo get supporting games like heavenly sword, heavy rain, remember me,bayonetta (yes, bayonetta is a positive example) femshep, portal etc.",

Two to answer your question, no men and women (as half of video game consumers are women  #NotYourShield ) don't want just women with huge boobs. For starters a lot of men don't like huge breasts, stop generalizing us as all doing so, also I guess lesbians too and bisexuals, since they also make up part of the consumer base.\n\nFurther when you look at video games you'll find there aren't even that many games that have women with outrageously huge breasts compared to the majority of games that have women with regular sized breasts. Portal, Last of Us, Heavenly Sword, Final Fantasy (pick any), Fallout, (pick any) Left 4 Dead (pick any), Bioshock Dead Island, Dead Rising, Persona (pick any), The Darkness (pick ether), Demon's Souls, Saints Row (pick any), \u00a0FEAR, Kuon, Warhammer 40k (pick any entry in the series) and so on, compared to how many games with huge breasts? Dead or Alive, Dynasty Warriors, Dragon's Crown 3?\n\nYou have 97-99% of games coming out with women being decently portrayed and you can only focus on the one or two whose core audience likes huge breasts? Honestly that speaks volumes about you more so than it does the industry. As for the industry offending me as a man, no. Now the movie industry assuming I don't want a well written female character without her being obnoxious, rude or marxist yes that does offend me. Why doesn't it offend me? Because the entire industry doesn't assume I want huge breasts. The majority of products don't have them and yes on occasions I can appreciate a nice set of breasts in the same way I want my main character to be ripped or in shape. It's part of the fantasy they've prepared and that vision shouldn't cater to anyone other than the artists and maybe fans if the developers want to.\n\nAs for women being called whores, there is a difference between dressing classy and showing skin and dressing trashy for attention. Statistically you are just as likely to be \"slut shamed' by women as you are men if not more so and studies show that it is also largely a class related issue. That aside not all women are called sluts for dressing provocatively, but before you complain about people excessive freedom of spreech go after magazines for their unrealistic portrayals of beauty that kill young girls concept of self worth forcing her to seek approval from other people to fill the void in herself.",

What's your point?\n\nAnd also he is kinda right: The majority does not portrait women in a specific sexist way. There are also games with outragious proportions for both genders, which then would not count as <b> sexism </b>since both genders are exxagerated.\n\nThere are some games with bad portrayal of women and even less games like that, that are successfull.\n\nFurthermore you are being heterosexist here:\n\nYou only think straigth males would enjoy that....what about<b>  homosexual</b>, bisexual and bicurious women who enjoy that as well?\n\n40% of Comic-Book readers are female and in both cases they also appreciate the celebration of the female AND male body in comic books.\u00a0\n\nYet over and over feminists try to make the human body as well a<b> s se</b>x something vile, evil, dirty, unnatural and corrupting.

                    "commentText": "+Meow Laksap\u00a0\n\nI don't understand what prevents \"certain\" women from getting into gaming. You claim that you are constantly told that games are \"for boys\" when all my life all I have heard is that women can do anything. \"You go gurl\" and all that. Even if that was the case (that women are discouraged from playing video games), <b> nobody </b>is forcing you not to play and participate. The gaming community has always wanted more members, male or female. You don't not have to conform to what society does normally. As the video demonstrates, there are many video game designers/artists/composers/voice actresses that are women who did not seem to get this command from on high that you particular women are afraid of going against. If men and boys can get into MLP:FiM with no issue in overwhelming numbers then surely women can get into something as inclusive as video games.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe only people who probably told you not to play video games, are your parents, teachers, or female friends. Because it certainly wasn't from people who played video games. This was also true for boys when I was still in high school. Boys of that time were discouraged by their teachers, parents, and peers not to play video games as they were \"for kids\". I know several guys who were bullied because they still played pokemon or yugioh in high school. And I'm talking real bulling; people beating you up and stealing your shit not the vanilla troll comment from an anonymous user on the internet. But we persevered and because of our love for video games, despite what our parents, peers, and the Jack Thompson's of the world would try to prevent, we (through our continuous support) made gaming incredibly inclusive as to draw in as many people as possible to the point where you have very same people who would bully the nerds for playing pokemon in highschool, now playing Call of Duty or Candy Crush in college.\n\n\"Are men that desperate to see women with no brain and big boobs in games.\"\n\nThere is almost no where I can find this to be a repeating factor that is used in video games. Female characters are typically shown to have a healthy diverse amount of character traits which include but are not limited to being beautiful, very intelligent, funny, dangerous and so forth. Many of which are quite capable as well. This ranges from Samus, Bayonetta, Ada Wong, Noel Vermillion, Neptune, every female pokemon trainer, Ayane, the Elf/Sorceress/Amazon from Dragon's Crown, Velvet,\u00a0Lighting,\u00a0Quelana of Izalith, Kat,\u00a0Ramlethal Valentine, Hibana, Homura,\u00a0Fio Germi,\u00a0Isabella Valentine (Ivy),\u00a0Lara Croft, and many, many more. People who only see women in video games as only (or even majorly) as damsels or simply 2 dimensional eye candy are deluded have no idea what they are talking about. Yes the female characters are beautiful and men find them attractive but the same could be said for women when it comes to male characters like Batman, Sephiroth, and Siegfried. People like attractive characters male or female, hence why there are no balding overweight male protagonists.\n\n\"It's so<b>  weird</b> when real women dress really revealing we get a lot of hate, for looking like a whore.\"\n\nAgain, you seem to be disconnected from reality. Women proudly can and do walk around sporting whatever revealing attire they wish, revealing or not and receive 0 backlash for it in real life. Women go on slutwalks and are widely supported for their right to do so. I have NEVER heard someone other than <b> a woma</b>n call anoth<b> er wom</b>an a whore in real life (where it matters), certainly not from any video game enthusiasts. Yeah, you might be called a slut by some troll on the internet, but you can, and will be called anything on the internet just so someone can get a rise out of you.",

Therefore the same issue that plagued you as a child likely won't happen to your own. This is simply a gap in generations not lining up with the gap in the growth of the gaming industry.

As awesome as scantily clad Dead or Alive characters are, it pales in comparison to playing Smash Brothers with a girlfriend that enjoys the games as much as we do.

Are men that desperate to see women with no brain and big boobs in games.\"\n\nThe gaming industry likes to portray women as being smart, brave, strong, and yes... sexy. The same way Hollywood portrays men. (Brad Pitt, George Klooney, Patrick Swayze) The women don't all have to have huge tits, but the men don't all have to have less than 4% body <b> fat </b>either. Don't forget that men are also sexualized in games and movies.\u00a0\n\nThe reality is,<b>  sex</b> and violence sells. Sure a game can make a female hero with a club foot, excessive bod<b> y fa</b>t, and a real shitty voice actor, but very few would pay for it. It defeats the purpose of making a video game, which is money.\n\nAnd yes, I like to see women who are intelligent, strong, independent, and chesty. Unfortunately, the vast majority of women do not fit that bill, just like most men don't have six-pack abs and perfect hair. If I felt ashamed of that, I would fix MYSELF, not go after men who are like that.\u00a0\n\nIt doesn't matter how cute you are or how you feel, the world isn't going to change to fit your desires.

I'm disgusted by people who are not gamers and not concerned or affected in any way lying to advance their agenda at gamers' expense. I don't desire to see brainless women portrayed in games, but I think it's no one's business to place censorship in place either.",

It's obvious why less women play different genre than men, since some games are create for men. Would you buy shampoo that says \"for women\"?. Although it isn't clear on the cover of the game, the content indicates who it is for. If game would change to become more female friendly (I'm not talking about inserting pink color, sprinkles and unicorns) than women would probably show up more.\u00a0\n\nFeeling offended doesn't make someone right, but it's wont change that fact that they are offended, it's up to people to choose if they want to listen or ignore. Btw, I wasn't the one who chose censor that sexy armor, didn't care for that game, Nor did I complain about it. So someone else must have done it. And they chose to listen. it's their choice not mine. Seriously tho why would someone go out and fight in a bikini? It's not every effective.\n\nI'm not a moron, just because you fail to see/ choose to ignore the similarities.

Video games have lots of strong handsome male charecters so I have no problem with them having attractive females too, I also don't care if the game allows you to pick up whores or something like that because the reality exists that some women are sluty irl too.

However, with your argument I have no choice but to make an exception. \n\nYour argument is quite xenophobic in nature, assuming that since she doesn't live in a \"free country\" (what is freedom anyway?) she has no right to speak. This is quite a fascist form of reasoning. \n\nYou claim Sweden to be a Neo-Feminist country, yes? Well then, if that is true, why haven't any of the Radical Feminists we hear about, Feminazis such as Anita Sarkeesian and Rebecca Waston, come from Sweden?

I'm sure your games will be interesting.\n\n\"It's not that easy for many girls when they grow up in a world that keeps telling them where we should belong and what we should like. I've been told contantly that games are for boys, adults would deny when I asked if I could have stuff they thought were for boys, like radio-controlled cars and a (game\"boy\"). I never got them, all I got was fake barbies and fake kitchen kit.\"\n\nSorry to hear that. My life wasn't quite like that growing up as a male. I guess telling others what to do isn't always so great.\n\n\"I just don't get why some games like to sexualize women.\"\n\nMaddox already answered why.\n\n\"Are men that desperate to see women with no brain and big boobs in games...isn't it degrading to men when the game companies assume that men want that?\"\n\nWell, I'm not necessarily \"desperate\", though I do enjoy it occasionally. I can tolerate and even enjoy sexy women in gaming...to an extent, but I have my limits and personal tastes. It doesn't feel degrading to me that gaming companies assume that I like it, I usually get mildly annoyed when I feel they go too far with a character's design. The only time I get defensive with this kind of assumption is when I'm in a serious discussion and people start assuming that I'm some pervy guy with dirty thoughts (or that men always act like it).",

Lets be honest, when real women dress in very revealing clothing, men will pay less attention to what shes saying and pay more attention to her physical features. Its nature. So, instead of objectifying women in real life, men end up doing it in their fantasy. When video game devs create men's fantasy in a video game form, men end up buying that game. Its that simple. Men dont find it degrading that companies assume what men want, because very attractive women really is a huge part of a male's fantasy.",

Maddox's point was that men are bad at designing video games for women, but they're open to women in the industry. So get in there and make some video games, and this whole problem goes away.\n\nThe issue is that no little girls dream of growing up to become game designers, while a lot of boys do. There is no <b> gender </b>barrier besides the self-imposed one. Men find the job appealing. So they do it. Women don't. So they don't. There is very little discrimination against hiring women in the industry, there are just no women trying to join. That's fine, but then if you bitch and moan later in life about the lack of diversity, well, that was your generation's own goddamn fault for not trying to be part of the industry when you had the chance. You could have gone to a graphic design school, but you didn't. Therefore, you don't get any special influence over the industry or what games they make, or say what the industry can and cannot do. You forfeited the right to control artistic vision when you refused to become one of those artists making that vision, just as I do not have the right to criticize a painters choice when I refused to become a painter. Well, I can criticize, but I'll look like a blowhard who doesn't know his shit, which is how a lot of feminists look now when video games.\n\nThere, I think that's a somewhat accurate summary of Maddox's opinion, mixed with my own. If it isn't, let him come down from...wherever he is...and smite me for it!",

Sometimes we nail it (as he says in the video), but most of the time, we fuck it up badly. To be fair, so do women. There's a reason men are completely unrealistic in almost all literature written by women, just as there's a reason women are so completely unbelievable in most stories written by men.\n\nIt's a general rule for writers to stick to their <b> gender </b>and background when writing characters. Even some of the best in the world can't write a good cross<b> -gender</b> person worth a damn, because its so damn hard. There is a need for more women in video games for the reason Maddox describes: men usually mean well, but mess up on the details and generally end up with a trope when writing <b> a woma</b>n. So, the obvious remedy would be to hire more women. Except that there simply aren't all that many women trying to get into video game development, which means creating a goo<b> d, gend</b>er-neutral workforce is quite hard.\n\nSo then the solution to that is quite obvious, though rather difficult: inspire young girls to participate in video games. To revel in them, and glorify them in the same way boys do. And tell them that it's perfectly alright for the to want to become a visual arts designer or a debugger, or a programmer. Get girls involved in video games, rather than trying to bully people into giving you what you want. That's never made any friends anywhere.",

The female gamer market is based around casual/addictive games because that's all you have when you don't have a clear cut win/lose scenario. If you look at the difference between the 1990s and now then you will see that casual/addictive games are on the rise, but why? Both sexes can enjoy casual/addictive games because they do not take a time commitment. On the toilet? Angry Birds it is! Females do not care about competitive gaming for the most part. Watch any female streamer play counterstrike or something similarly competitive. They just die in the game? No words of upset; just complete nonchallance. No \"Shit, I should have went left\", they don't care, they will continue talking about their day or whatever else is on their mind (lack of testosterone). Everything in life is sexist because not realizing the differences between sexes makes you a total fucking moron. Oh, I need to move this piano, but I only have either a girl or a guy to help me, better choose the girl because some random twat on the Internet told me that you shouldn't realize differences between the sexes! It's all fucking stupid and now you have this LAW where both parties have to actually verbally consent to have <b> sex.</b> You are all going to have to start writing up<b>  sex</b> contracts before the next decade rolls around. Illegal to record the act for proof of consent without permission, but then the other party can just claim rape with no proof? This bologna shit fires me up fierce.",

For example, there is an organisation called TFYC which is doing this right now, investing in female game developers. You could contribute to their campaigns or you could set up your own similar one (of course I'm not saying you have the resources to do so especially instantly, but given enough time and enough crowed sourcing anyone should be able to pull it off).",

For every example you could name of a game belittling women, I can think of 20 more where that doesn't happen and quite a number of strong positive examples of female characters, like Chie from Persona 4 or The Boss from MGS3.\n\nThis is probably why I don't like sharing Sarkisian's video. Even though I agree with the overall point, I'm afraid that it'll create a perception that games are<b>  misogynist</b> in nature and thus less women will want to become game designers and then the problems presented in the video are only perpetuated further. That's the nature of a argument which (self admittedly) cherry picks it's points.\n\nThank you so much for just reading and considering my point of view.",

Rather, I think the issue is bad writers exist and when these bad writers are predominantly male they are <b> blind </b>to these issues and thus they create these tropey terrible stories and limited player cohesion.\u00a0\n\nI can say I still felt immersed even in Starcraft 2: Heart of the swarm, where you play as Kerrigan saving her love interest Jim. Beyond that, I get the sense that most well written games are more<b>  gender</b> neutral, like Rock of Ages where you are literally a rock, I would recommend checking out. Though at this point I'm just plugging some of my favourite games, do check them out though if you like the genre.\n\nI guess the point is even though the majority of developers are male, the saving grace is there is a palpable amount of games you could still enjoy and are well written.\n\nI still think the argument in the video is a valid solution even if we suppose your premise is true. Given their are women in the gaming industry producing games and by at least slowly creating some sort of domino effect. Maybe you don't like what you perceive to be a majority of the games now (I at least think there are a lot you could enjoy right now, but nonetheless), but this should at least somewhat change over the years as women who can still enjoy games also become developers and improve thus encourage further and further generations.",

            "commentText": "sigh Almost every comment on this video proves Maddox's point.\n\nI acknowledge that more and more women are playing video games, and I say that's a good thing. Though here's the thing. Just because women are playing games now, does not mean developers are going to change the way they make games or change how they advertise for them.\n\nPeople like to complain and moan about how devs need to be more inclusive and representative if they want to survive... You wanna know something? That's completely and utterly false.\u00a0\n\nIn 2014 most devs still make games staring white male protagonist and are actually making more money than ever before. When they portray women in <b> sexual </b>ways, they make even more money.\u00a0\n\nDevs know for a fact that they do not need to be inclusive to make money and there are examples where being inclusive has harmed their profits.\n\nI mean look at Assassin's Creed. Arguably one of the most diverse game franchises in the industry right now. With 7 games in the primary releases. The one that stared a female protagonist was the worst selling and the worst in reviews, and the recent HD re-release on the Xbox 360 and PS3 didn't do anything to help despite how many people are upset that there is no female protagonist in Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is that if you want a game that meets your taste that hasn't come out yet then YOU have to be the one to make it if the current devs aren't. GTAV is the best selling game in history, despite having no female leads and two of the three male leads being white men.\n\nComplaining will not convince devs to change the way they do things especially since they're making millions of dollars over doing the opposite of what you want.\n\nThey don't need to change to make money so they won't change. Complaining will not, and never will solve this issue. Take initiative.",

Having a<b>  woman</b> as a main character in a setting that sees her battle male foes is actually not very realistic.\n\nMy point is, this is all fantasy, and the fact that you don't like the skimpy outfits but are quite happy to entertain the idea of <b> a woma</b>n going around besting the best male warriors means that you are happy entertaining one fantasy and condemn the other based on your personal tastes. So why do you have a problem when men do the exact same thing but choose to entertain the former?\n\nThis industry has been around for a long time and for most of that time it's been very male dominated. I'm happy to see more women playing games these days but if they are not happy with what they see then they should follow the proper channels and make games that they find more to their tastes, instead of selfishly trying to destroy what has already been established.",

A character that doesn't display any enjoyment in wearing sexy clothes and act like a desperate goody-two-shoes teenager will only make me believe that this character is only created to cater to male audience <b> sexual </b>desires. Similarly with a female warrior character that dress normally but displays no tendency to act remotely close to a warrior.\n\nbesides the major discussion isn't about character traits or personality its about diversity in female character design. When is the last time you saw an<b>  elderly</b<b> > woma</b>n as a major character? Why limit role playing games \"role playing\" asset by flooding the female costumes closet with sexy dresses.",

Asking video game designers to cut out the<b>  sexual</b> degradation of women is literally asking a company to make less money. You might feel they have a moral duty to do that, but unless laws are put in place no company is going to actively make less money.\u00a0\n\nIt's like asking Sky Sports to show more women's football. Sky Sports doesn't show women's football because there is no demand for it. Demand = money, and there is a huge demand for violence an<b> d se</b>x in the video games industry.\u00a0\n\nThe options are limited. You can increase the number of female video gamers to introduce different demands, but good luck with that. If you think that the video game world is only dominated by boys because <b> of s</b>ex and violence, you're wrong. Video games have been around for decades and girls just simply aren't as interested and thus will never have a significant say. The other option is of course to introduce legal remedies, but all your doing there is hurting current gamers and gaming industries.",

Alright, fine, we also know that the majority of casual gamers is comprised of girls (ie smartphone/facebook gamers), so that point goes when we toss out all women to address your point.\n\nIf you exclude all the statistics about women, since we're trying to disprove that the majority of gamers are teenage boys, we're left with that 52% being converted to a 100% (since it IS the majority and it IS all males) and (if you'd bothered to download the PDF) the 17% of boys aged 18 or younger becomes ~32% of all relevant gamers.\n\nI am going to assume that you are smart enough to know that 32% of the males playing video games being under 18 pretty definitively proves that most gamers being teenagers is a very FALSE assertion.",

I don't give a crap about what's between the legs of the people who developed the games I play. I really don't. It's the very last thing that might come through my mind when I'm either working, or enjoying a game.\nBut you see, when I was at the university studying computer science, in our class of about 60 people, only (holds up fingers to count) 7 girls. One of them quickly switched to accounting, .. nope, sorry, 8 girls. Yeah. 3 of them dropped out, and only 3 of them actually stayed in class, and ... shit, sorry. 9 girls total. Yeah. Just one of them actually studied anything in computer science.\nIn another class there was a girl who was better than me. I remembered her from competitions where she beat me. And let me tell you this: I was good, so she was the only girl I knew who was better than me. Anyway, years have passed, she is QA, I am a developer with a hobby of playing with video game SDKs and engines (too little time on my hand to do it seriously). The one exception, the only girl I knew who was better than me, chose to analyze other people's products instead of using her talents to create new things.\n\nGirls just aren't into computers as much as boys are. That's why there will always be more male developers, and more male game developers.\n\nMy problem is that social justice agendas are pushed ahead of real objective needs for qualifications from employees or expectations by the target market.",

Look at stem fields, women are fucking encouraged to study those in some countries. Yet they still go for other things.\n\nA cousin of mine, who is now in the time to start choosing her career/future and could've gone for anything she wanted, since she has the grades, the brain and the will, still picked biology instead of physics or\u00a0engineering. She wasn't your typical \"girly\" girl either. She had interests which are considered \"boyish\". Nor was she fed stereotypical female toys when she was younger.\n\nFeminists should get in their fucking heads people nowadays are basically free to choose what they want to do and if that means they pick less profitable careers, so be it.

A hardcore sports fan is someone who spends a hundred extra bucks a month on the premium sports package, follows at least one specific team religiously, and has preferences and biases about the other teams.\n\nTo a hardcore gamer, one who fits that 3 step list just fine, games are the things they do in their spare time more than any other one thing. It's what they think about, it's what they argue about, it's what they talk about with every warm body they come across.\n\nIt's not down to the games they play, it's not down even down to how much time they spend playing them. It's down to how much of their identity is wrapped up in video games as a passtime, as an industry, and as an entertainment medium.\n\nThe reason those games are considered casual by definition is because it is a hell of a lot harder to get excited about, talk about, and argue about a game that has 10 total mechanics, no story to speak of, and relies almost exclusively on microtransactions and time delays to keep you playing.\u00a0\n\nTry comparing that to the LA Kings and Hockey and you should see the distinction.",

I'll either play it irregardless of what the playable character looks like, or just not buy it / play it at all. Hell, Bayonetta was suggestive as hell, and ya know what? I fuckin' loved it. She's sexy as hell. :o\n\nPoint being, if it offends you so much, well... the only thing you can really do is try and write / sell / make your own game, but I can tell you right now that there ain't a chance in hell that it will make some revolutionary turn of events in other video games. There will ALWAYS be perverted women in video games across the world. I know it's easier said than done, but if you don't like it, avoid it.

What hope do us average Joes have?\n\nYou're likely basing what you think women like to see written about based on what you've heard from feminists and the like, not actual women, so you probably know less than you think. How else do you explain why Twilight and 50 Shades of Grey are so popular with women? Everything about those plots are contrary to what everyone says women like. Women say they want a strong, well written female, but they eat up Bella and Anastasia in droves.\n\nPart of what makes appealing to women so difficult is what they say they want is vastly different from what their actual behavior demonstrates. Hell, look at fashion magazines and Cosmopolitan. How do they stay in business when so many women claim to hate it? Meanwhile, if a man tell you he wants guns and tits, then by Yevon guns and tits it is! They say women think more with their heart than their mind, but everyone knows the heart doesn't always want what's best for the mind.",

(There's even software that you could look up that's able to determine the <b> gender </b>of an author with some degree of reliability, though that's more a matter of style.)\n\nWriting for an audience is more than just being able to write characters accurately. You have to connect with your readers, and that involves many subtleties that are difficult to get right for an outsider.\n\nOf course, the fact of the matter is that games are much more than their scripts and character designs. You can't just put a coat of paint over a game and expect it to appeal to some other demographic, which is the major fallacy at the core of most of these discussions, and not one that's unique to gaming, incidentally.\n\nSome people are dead set in proving the premise that the male and female brain are identical, and will come up with convoluted explanations for any evidence that points to the contrary. The fact that playing videogames was something that appealed more to boys than girls since the beginning, and that there are entire genres (particularly action based or highly competitive games, and of course fighting and car games) where the audience is overwhelmingly male, presents a challenge for this people, so they have to come up with farfetched explanations to make it fit their narrative, like pretending that the reason your mother didn't play Doom was because the protagonist wasn't a<b>  woman</b>.",

Seeing that the former is about a relationship rather than just character creation.\nAnother thing, I can safely resume you haven't come in contact with a lot of yaoi, while it might not be realistic, some of it is terribly dark and at times disturbing. I never said anything about them being realistic, fiction doesn't have to be. It's about the ability to create a character whose life and personality have <b> nothing </b>to do with the life and personality of the writer. It's called having an imagination. Female yaoi mangakas are pretty good at that.\n\nAbout writing, any good writer should be able to write a good character and make it feel human.<b>  Gender</b> is not a personality. Making women all about thei<b> r gende</b>r is bad writing. I do recommend you try the other link as well. The author of \"The Legend of the Sun Knight\" is extraordinary good at making complex characters.

It's more that, as others have mentioned, a lot of times the game will still perform well without good characters because other aspects carry it.\n\nBut there is also the problem of how videogame writing's usually done.\n\nWriters are in the last position in gaming when it comes to production. Above them we have game designer, programmers, graphic designers, artists, marketers, PR, etc. Game writers usually comes into the development scene about halfway through the development cycle with most of the assets and gameplay and vision already set in stone. Game writers usually don't have any creative freedom. They are dictated by what the other sides of the development team think about the game, the assets they've put in, the tone the gameplay gives to the player, etc (which is why disparity between gameplay and story is rampant in the industry). Imagine you having to make a story on that kind of condition.\n\nAll in all, video games mostly have bad stories and characters due to the publishers or devs not giving any attention to the story and not having writers be more involved in the process of making games (for example, have them be a permanent member of your team from the start, let them make changes and give suggestions to the gameplay and graphics department, etc)\n\nThankfully it seems that the industry is lightening up in a huge way to games with good stories that actually makes a unified tone and massage with the rest of the game. Games like Journey, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, This War of Mine, Valiant Hearts, even Divinity Original Sin have shown that putting a good story, characters and dialogues in your game is actually worth it and can hugely increase your profit. We're starting to see a trend of indie games trying to appeal to the audience with a good story tied with it's gameplay. Hopefully this trend can spread to the AAA world.",

As a writer, you want people to read your book. Because that's more money, which allows you to continuing writing.

You really think that there is such a huge difference between genders? Now that's lazy writing. Even then, a writer should always aim to appeal to as many as possible. \nIt's not like I would easily identify with a very girly character, being rather butch in my appearance. Heck, I can't identify with real such women. So I'm not the demographic of<b>  chick</b> lit.

Do you think it's coincidence that every human society has had men being dominant at some point in their history? Either all humans around the world had some telepathic link to share this <b> common </b>idea, or every human male was genetically inclined to this idea when they slowly began to walk upright and use tools.\n\nThe only point I was trying to make by mentioning E.L. James and Tom Clancy's work is that men and women do naturally have differences in preference. Having something exist that both genders enjoy doesn't negate that both genders will still have different preferences.\n\nA writer doesn't have to write anything that will offend one<b>  gender</b> or another to still have only a particula<b> r gende</b>r gravitate towards it. There some some things that just don't resonate well with the average male or female. For example, the average male would not want to read a story about a girl who spends most of the time trying to romance an attractive man with vivid descriptions about how attractive said man is.\n\nAnd from a realistic view point, asking every writer to be J.K. Rowling and Tolkien is like asking every artist to be Michelangelo. Some artists can only draw hot anime girls really well to make a career out of it, and some writers can only write sappy romance novels to make a career out of it.

Also, notice I said genders, pointing towards the fact that there is more than two. Intergender is a thing. \n\nEvolution has <b> nothing </b>to do with preference. During the romantic area women wrote horror and in ancient Greek men wrote big epos involving love. In different parts of the world people have enjoyed different kinds of stories. Not that long ago, the ability to read was limited to the privileged classed. \n\nJ.K. Rowling as Michaelangelo? She was able to appeal to all genders but she isn't sensational as an author. Decent yes but not something spectacular. As for Tolkien, there are authors who have gained reputation for being in that league. Unfortunately, most people have never read fantasy and is unaware of who they are. I don't consider Tolkien to be exceptional either. There is no such thing as perfect after all. \n\nI will stand by the fact that<b>  gender</b> doesn't affect preference.

Mobile games rarely lack skill or necessity for mastery or competitive play. Pandering these games to a female audience which is already not interested will not please their actual audience, who are predominantly men. http://i.imgur.com/N833yqd.jpg\n\nThe numbers tell a story and that narrative is not that women play the types of games where journalists and developers tell us women would play if they were less' icky'. If they follow through with this trend, they WILL lose sales. Men will not buy them because they will become watered down and not contain the things they traditionally like. If the recent  #gamergate  scandal tells us anything, there is also a huge backlash against trying to shame them for doing just that; rejecting this kind of agenda driven and forced injection of inclusiveness is genres where it doesn't belong.

If games which include big breasted women doing things in ways that titillate men sell, then those are the games that are going to be made. They do not need to compromise to sell. They do worse for trying to compromise. The developers that make those games pure like that will find their market and make their money.

Why should the games industry care about people who play free mobile games and browser games? The industry cares about how much money they can make. People who play Farmville on the toilet give them about 1$ of revenue per customer, and are very unlikely to play more than a handful of games over a long period of time. There is no such thing as a guarantied seller, nor do customers have any brand loyalty. Its a nightmare to make money consistently in that environment, ask Zynga.\nIn the end, men are much more likely to buy 400$ consoles with 15 60$ games and a monthly 5$ online subscription. These are two COMPLETELY different types of customers, and it would be retarded to consider the mobile demographic when creating a non mobile game.",

It has gotten to the point where people can literally waste several hundred dollars in a matter of hours playing a game of candy crush when using their pay to win tactics.\nNot saying tha there isn't pay to win in the rest of the actual gaming industry but it has always been most prominent in the ios and facebook regions.\nDue to the fact that they are copy paste's of one another, have essentially been flash games (which are completely free if you look on your computer with no added strings), constantly promote their own pay-to-win devices and have the worst ports imaginable...if you say casual games are part of the main gaming industry then fuck off.\nI will not accept farmvill as a game.\nand as such no, female gamers don't make half the consumer base as they predominantly come from the facebook and ios side of things and they never will be taken seriously by the rest of the industry due to the current mass consumer base looking upon it as that small puppy that humps your leg and won't get the fuck off no matter how many times you beat it with a stick.\n\nThat does not mean to say there couldn't be a consumer base for females but they have to accept that certain games are targeted for men and if they want games targeted for them that aren't pieces of shit then they will have to develop them themselves, If they have ideas then why not try to work for them like indie developers do, if your successful then that may be what the industry needs, a <b> woman </b>with bright ideas, If the game fails then it may turn out that your ideas are actually a sack of shit like 50% of indie games which barely pass into the steam market due to them essentially self promoting themselves like \"garry's incident\" and forcing all negative reviews off the face of the internet...which i think feminists may attempt if anyone publically declares a game to be made by a full female dev team regardless of how shit the game may be.",

I even contacted three companies, one answered that the way they get statistics was a company secret, the other two didn't bother replying. You know something is ackward when they try to hide it from you..\n\nBut telling that doesn't mean women don't play does it? It just implies that women play different game, and those games aren't the same as MEN games because we are different, dance revolution, little poney and any other \"girl\" games are clearly different than a god of war, uncharted, tomb raider, call of duty and so on.\u00a0\n\ntherefore, women can just shut the fuck up about pegi 18's games because it's a category of games that doesn't have a large amount of women playing. Game made by men for men are free to design the game just the way they please because if they tried to make a <b> cheesy </b>game, it just wouldn't sell.\n\nAs for representation of women, scenario and design are the property of the author creating it, if one decide mario has to save a princess, you just shut the fuck up and buy the game or shut the fuck up and leave it alone or create your own fucking game to change mario into the victim and peach into the savior. \u00a0And please remember, feminists always claim that women are the first victim in reality, how come representing the reality in video games be a bad representation of women? Any clue? Don't you think that's<b>  dumb</b>? Yeah i think so too.\n\nps : And i know \u00a0that women play games like the one i said above, but if i made games and had 80 % males and 20 % females as target, i wouldn't care about the 20% females because i get 80% of males playing my game.

Like they say, follow the money. \u00a0\n\nIf women want games that pander to what they like, they should make it themselves, especially since they don't even buy the damn games. Games like Skyrim, Saints Row, Tomb Raider (reboot just to avoid the \"over sexualized\" crap), and Mirrors Edge give you option of playing as women, yet men are still the ones buying these games in an overwhelming majority. The game industry was built by men, for men. Women coming in and expecting men to make games for them is ridiculous.

People make that which is profitable. You know what women spend the most money on? Zynga. You know what men spend money on? Everything else. So as a male developer who became a game developer because he loves games and making them, he will make games that he will love, and other men will love. And he will become rich and be happy. What feminists demand now is for their needs to be catered to. Why? Are they paying money? NO. They are not buying the games that men want to make.\n\nLet me give you an example:\nWorld of Tanks.\nThis game is made by a company in Belarus, but it is now spread across the globe as one of the largest MMO games. The action is like this: 30 players get picked randomly for a quick match, 15 in each team. Even though the game is free to play, you can't really go very far without buying a premium account (10$ per month), and buying premium in-game items, which is much more expensive. An average player in Europe spends about 20$ per month on this game. And there are millions of players.\nNow, you are VERY lucky, if you have a girl playing in one of the teams. That's one girl, from 30 players, and considered luck.\nGirls are either very bad at this game, or don't play at all, with VERY VERY few being quite good at it. Don't ask me why. I don't know and I don't care.\n\nSo, this game is with male voices, male characters (crew), male players. It is 99% male. Except in its HQ. There are a lot of women working on the game, on the maps, on the models, on the arts, and even coding. Still, dominated by males.\n\nWhat to do to make it more female-friendly? Paint tanks pink? Not historically accurate, and stupid. Female crews? Not historically accurate. Shoot with ponies maybe?\n\nYou know a great solution for this?\nInstead of whining everywhere about this bullshit, why wont you go, take your whiny friends, and shut up, and make a game for girls. Because that's what guys do. They make stuff, so that you can attack them for making them not to your liking. The nerve...",

Sexualising/ making women look weak in video games isn't about the target market, its about not degrading women, its about respecting people. If your relating sexualising women to magazines then how about we say, when was the last time you walked into a store and saw a naked/almost naked man on the cover of a magazine, not recently where's for men is a whole marker of naked women on front covers.We don't expect men to know what women are like either, we simply expect decency and for men to know what is fucking degrading and what's not, that's different from knowing what we are like, its decency. I's great we are designing video games, and I understand that will help stop a bi of the <b> sexism,</b> but there will still be male game designers who will still degrade women, being in the industry doesn't stop what the industry is doing. Can I emphasise that enough ? Us making video games will add to the amount of video games, it will not remove the sexist video games (I am not saying women shouldn't make video games, just pointing out that it wont eradicate<b>  sexism</b> which is what your saying). I know I am repeating what I was saying but you repeated the same thing for a minute and no one questioned you.",

Creators have<b>  zero</b> duty or obligation to do anything for anyone - if you dislike the way a certain group is portrayed within a piece of media, don't buy it. Don't support it. You have every right to express your opinion about it. But demanding that the industry as a whole shouldn't condone certain things is just asinine. The fact is that most video games are the creations of males, and most of the people consuming video games are also male. That's why \"male\" is seen as the \"norm\" while females are treated as a variation - to a male, being male is the \"norm\". A game developer who is male creating art that females struggle to identify with is not surprising in the least.",

Even if they were, the women that play video games don't really give a shit about the <b> gender </b>of a character.\nObviously video games aren't pandered only to men, because an artistic design to a video game generally doesn't involve handfuls of tits and monster trucks allover the screen, the content there can easily be enjoyed by either<b>  sex</b> o<b> r gende</b>r.\nPicking out the Assassin's Creed Unity controversy recently, why the fuck would anyone care about t<b> he gend</b>er of the characters of multiplayer? It's a blank and emotionless avatar that you control wh<b> ich nob</b>ody will have any sort of connection with anyways. It's just an entity you control to perform a task in the game, plain and simple.\nEven with things like Mortal Kombat where you've got oversexualised characters, the women I personally know in real life who play and enjoy MK simply don't care about the revealing costumes and such. They enjoy the game for the game. Same thing with the damsel-in-distress model.\nI understand why some women might feel uncomfortable about these revealing costumes and whatever else they complain about in their games, and I understand why they'd try protest against such things for their personal enjoyment out of the game, but as of yet there hasn't been a big enough of a proven audience for anyone to risk a bunch of money just to pander to what's possibly, easily, a vocal minority when it conflicts with an artistic design for a video game.\nIf the nit-picky women want enlightenment from these stigmas in video games, then they're going to have to take their own step to pander to themselves, but I'm firm in my belief that what we currently already have is fine.\n\nWell most of this comment is probably a pointless argument to you specifically, but this is what I hope to be as complete of an argument that you might need.",

The only difference is that guys thing that the buff dudes are cool, and girls complain about the hot chicks. <b> Nobody </b>admits it, but a fair proportion of the complaining females are just jealous that a fake character could be so attractive. While it's not all of you girls, there's quite a few. The reason why guys don't talk about it is because they're no jealous and judgmental nitpicking idiots. they like romanticized men. Hell, buff people feed their egos. I'm not telling you that you have to have the same attitude, but at least keep that in mind the next time you want to make a half baked complaint such as this.",

Right, it must be such a serious issue that 40% of the consumers are not willing to change their purchasing habits in protest of it. \n\nI'm not even going to mention the fact that your statistic is wrong, even when trying to quote the original claim, and it's already been proven by other market research that women are not the majority consumer of AAA video games, which are the games the whole discussion seems to focus on. They play social, mobile and puzzle games the most. How many AAA games are social, mobile or a puzzle game?",

Okay, I see where you're coming from with that.\n\nBut with my point about magazines I was trying to point out the differences between magazines and games and why comparing them doesn't make sense.\n\nThe fact is that many magazines are created for a specific <b> gender.</b> Whether or not a man buys a women's mag, or a<b>  woman</b> buys a men's, doesn't change how their crafted. And the big difference in games is that almost half the people who buy and play games are women. You won't get nearly that many men, on the flip side, buying feminine mags. So there's no call to make a change unless the creators want it.\n\nThe problem is that this guy, AAA producers, and the people who think like them are happy keeping things the way they are, but for different reasons. There are so many things that need to change to make games awesome again, and making better female characters is the least of them.",

Women can have personalities just like male protagonists...I mean, we aren't a totally different species!

Shrinking profit margins in the AAA market are not simply due to \"not enough women\" buying them, it's due to the increasing demand of high-fidelity games compounded with the rising development costs to meet those requirements and the ability to balance the two out or the lack of sense in the industry to compromise both of the above to create a compelling enough game for the market to digest.\n\nCowardice and <b> sexism </b>- untrue yet again. If you work in the industry, you learn that It's not that<b>  sexism</b> in AAA games cause the lack of a female audience (faulty causation), it's that the interests of the majority of that 46% women demographic lies mainly in casual/puzzle/life simulation/pokemon games whilst the women that choose to enter the gaming sub-culture are more often than not apathetic when it comes \"representation\" in the largely male demographic targeted games.\n\nThis is not to say that women CAN'T create their own niche. Here in Japan, there are lots of games that caters solely to the female demographic. The only problem is the market is not(and probably never will be) as big as the male targeted AAA games so they will always end up lacking in polish when compared to those released by bigger companies. Mobile games on the other hand has a huge female market and the games that the design of the games reflect their tastes.",

Even games which traditionally would have fallen into this type manage to avoid the trap - for example, Hotline Miami, an ultra-violent story about a thug who finds and rescues a mysterious girl during one of his missions, doesn't have any sexualization because of its pixellated graphics, and instead uses the plot device of the girl as well as its looks and mechanics to build an hallucinated and alienating atmosphere which removes every glamour from the violence, making the whole affair a dirty, bloody mess to slosh through.\n\nOf course it takes time to build up the momentum to unseat the \"giants\", who hold the economic monopoly of the big stuff. Making an AAA game takes time and resources. Personally I grew tired of most Call of Duty clones long time ago simply because they're boring and honestly pretty much all the same - down to the desaturated, brownish colour palette.",

Actively changing something like you suggested seems to be the best way to me.\nAt the same time I believe I do have a right to have my<b>  gender</b> represented as equal in video games and everywhere else.\nIt doesn't matter if the designers are men and trying to appeal to a male fanbase.\nAfter all th<b> e sexis</b>m in games is mostly not that there are hot women, it's when they get reduced to only this, stereotypes <b> or wei</b<b> >rd gen</b>der roles. I sure hope the lack of character is not what guys find so appealing!\nAnd men should of course be expected to portray us correctly. Why ever not? Do you believe there is such a huge difference in genders or points of view? Like what? A writer can definitly create great male AND female charcters. If someone feels insecure they can always do a little research, just like with different cultures, religions or upbringings.\nIt's not okay to reduce a group of people to stereotypes or to make them fit a certain role just because they are not the ones the product is aimed at. Would you de<b> fend ra</b>cism like that?\nAlso girls do buy the product, we always have. Do not tell us to shut up and<b>  take s</b>exism just because we might be a minority. Not all of us can enter the gaming industry, still we can all speak out for our rights and interests.\n\nAnd your compaision to magazines doesn't work.

The problem with video games is not lack of fashion, it is representation of <b> women. </b>Gender equality is not an interest but a right.\n\nAnother of your statements made me wonder a little. You said you can not identify with being female, but <b> being </b>a woman isn't solely about femininity. While I might not identify with a mans masculinity, I can do so with, for example, his opinions. Is this not possible for you? You didn't say it, but to me it sounded that way.

                    "commentText": "I would point out that, in the video games in question, (I'm assuming we're talking mass-produced shit like CoD or AC, rather than a piece of art like Transistor) everyone is a stereotype. It's not just women.\n\nThey're a straight man? OK, they're brooding, if they have a personality at all. They're emotionally unavailable, have a family but are terrible fathers, and enjoy destruction in some form, usually killing.\n\nThey're <b> gay<b> ?</b</b>> Then they're a villian, but not one to be taken seriously. They are an embarrassing fop devoid of redeeming \"masculine\" (AKA shooty-shooty) qualities.\n\nThey're a child? They're an NPC, and they're a McGuffin to be saved as the plot needs it them to be. They're devoid of emotion and usefulness, and must be carefully guarded or else hey'll die. They cannot, under any circumstances, do anything themselves. This applies particularly for girls.\n\nLook, no one likes the caricatures found in mainstream gaming. Women don't, and that is well known through series like tropes vs women in video games, but I don't think so many people know that men hate the stereotypes just as much as women, or that children, a good portion of the playerbase of the game, don't like being portrayed as useless stupid idiots. And I'd bet th<b> e L<b> GB<<b> /b</b</b>>>T community does not appreciate being portrayed as degenerate effeminates or as butches.\u00a0\n\nAnd if we're talking about games that actually try, games that tell a story, there's very little inequality to be seen. Valve is, if anything, anti-men, with women being portrayed as strong, competent leaders in all their games, and men being portrayed as gun-happy idiots or greedy, weak bastards causing the destruction of humanity (see Portal, Half-Life, TF1&2).\n\nTomb Raider as a series is quite good a portraying women. No, seriously. I honestly don't know why it's gotten a bad wrap for having a big-breasted protagonist who sometimes wears a cutoff T-shirt. She's a strong lead who is shown being on better than equal footing with all the men in her life, and neither of those supposed knocks are in any way unrealistic, as I'm pretty sure women have big breasts and wear cut-off T-shirts.\n\nEverything done by David Cage (Beyond: Two Souls for reference<b> ) is ge</b>nder neutral, as are a lot of comedic games like Ratchet and Clank and Psychonauts.\n\nThen when you get into interactive story games (I'm distinguishing these from RPGs in that the decisions you make here matter, while in an RPG, you're following a set story), like Mass Effect, Fallout, Bioshock, and many more, the female story lines are just as fleshed out as the male ones, or the female characters are equally as important. And in the case of Fallout, even the NPCs are balanced. The ratio of male to female hookers is just about 1:1, and there's even a robot for good measure!\n\nThere's your mystery and horror games, which are p<b> urely g</b>ender neutral, though again portraying basically only men as vicious psychos, which I dislike, being a more gentle fellow myself.\n\nSandbox games: they're sandbox games. You can be literally whoever you want. Minecraft, the Sims games, and to some extent Animal Crossing, are completely neutral. You play as you. There are no stereotypes, or, in the case of the sims, everyone gets stereotyped for laughs. No problems here. Actually, I'm throwing strategy games here, too, because you play as yourself as well. Civ never tells you you're a man or tells you yo<b> u're a</b> woman. You are who you are in real life.\n\nIn your mobas, you have equally bad portrayals, with men being roided-up berserkers or sneaky tricksters, and women being...roided-up berserkers or sneaky tricksters. Actually, I guess it's not so bad there, as I think about it.\n\nAnd lastly, there's your RPGs. (I'm not covering platformers because, well, they're platformers. They are literally point a to point b puzzles. Not all that much to talk about.) RPGs are mixed. These include such titles as Fire Emblem, Transistor, Diablo, WoW, and many more. Fire Emblem and Transistor, along with others like them, are neutral. They have strong women, strong men, weak women, and weak men, a good portion of which is determined by you. The others include WoW, Diablo, Borderlands <b> and th</b>e Elder Scrolls. These games it is somewhat fair to have a be<b> ef wit</b>h. Elder Scrolls does actually make the women more than bags of meat, where you can talk to them, get to know them, and even marry them, if you come to like them. You can have them as fighting allies in all games, though usually with less clothing. They serve a vital role in the story of all games, though there's usually less of them than men. You can make a case for the RPG genre to have issues with portrayal of women, and you'd at least be partially right, but even then, it's still not so bad as to be misogynistic, just, as Maddox pointed out, a lack of understanding. Someone clearly made the effort in Skyrim. Did it come out great? Nah, but some person, clearly a man, tried. If you want more, then get in there and try yourself! Men can only do so much guesswork as to what women want in their characters, and it's import<b> ant fo</b>r a woman to step in at that point and take charge. Men aren't keeping women out of the creative teams of games like Skyrim. The women simply aren't there!\n\nSorry for such a long post, but I figured I should summarize everything all at once, and well, there was a lot to cover.\n\nBasically, as a tl;dr: Outside of FPS games and some unsavory RPGs, <b> wheres </b>the sexism? Few games make a seemingly conscious effort to piss of women, and no genre is explicitly sexist, besides FPS's which are primarily sexist towards men. In fact, most genres<b>  are in</b>deed gender neutral. If there is a clumsiness to how female portrayal is handled, that may be due to the lack of women in the video games industry.",

Censoring is not always a good thing",

            "commentText": "So basically <b> sexism </b>in games is okay because that's what men want and they can't recognize when they are being sexist as men? So if an audience has racists or pedophiles, its totally okay for them to bring that kind of content\u00a0 to the masses because it sells and they were born that way, so how can we expect anything less? Its obvious that women don't have boobs bigger than their entire torsos or that we all act like that, by just being around us. It sells because they can't get women like that in real life; its labeled \"fantasy\" for a reason. Just being male doesn't mean you're<b>  blind</b>. I agree that taking action and actually trying to create positive women role models in games is better than just complaining, but if spreading your opinion alone didnt do anything, why is he bothering to make these videos? Word of mouth helps.\n\nI think its okay to fantasize, until its apparent that its causing people to actually expect that and stereotype real people. As is the case here. Around too much of the male population women feel like we're just a walking talkin<b> g se</b>x toy. Without a brain or other purpose. Why do you think that is? Because men inundate themselves with images and sterotypes that women a<b> re nothi</b>ng more than a turn-on. You don't think you are affected by the media? How do you think communists and dictators manage to brainwash people? You really think that with all the wealth and power involved sellers aren't spending all their energy figuring out how to exploit you? There is a quote by Hitler's propaganda mastermind, Joseph Goebbels : \"If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.\" The more po<b> rn, sex</b>ism, and negative stereotypes you see of women, the more you are willingly brainwashing yourself into seeing them that way. The more you are hooked on sexist content, the more you rationalize and pressure us to conform. You are just making their job easier; producers don't have to justify the filth they put out, because you just shit on anyone who says otherwise. How many times have I tried to explain this only to be told:\u00a0 \"Tits or GTFO, bitch!\".\n\nAlso, as an aside,<b>  the se</b>xism against men he pointed out is wrong too. It causes allot of heartbreak and unreasonable expectations about the<b>  male g</b>ender in a relationship, as I am sure you men have noticed. But that's not a reason to continue sexualizing women. Two wrongs don't make a right.",

Artists do not NEED to pander to ANYBODY.

Both sexes have the capacity of enough empathy to understand the character as a person instead of just a certain <b> sex.</b>\n\nIt would be really refreshing to see some female characters who can be taken seriously and who are not based on (misogynistic) tropes.",

What about Doom , Qauke , Duke Nukem , CoD ,Wolfenstein , Half Life , Far Cry etc... What do they have in <b> common </b>? \u00a0Some guy runs around and kills people with his super human skills. All of these games are just fantasies. It would be cool to be like them but we know we can and never will be. I think it's illogical to say that after creating such a stereotypical hero in a fantasy world that anything else in the game containing women should be representation of real life.",

Or your speaking to the rare people who have the money, time and software to create an enjoyable, profitable and well marketed game. No it's because it sells right? I get that, I mean I love the medium that is video games. I just hate that women who are supposed to be strong warriors who can kick yours and anyone's ass are wearing little to nonexistent clothes. I hate that it sells. I hate that no one really does anything about it or when they do they are met with horrible people who should not represent the gaming community. And they are not saying they are dressed too sexy their making the point that <b> sex </b>doesn't sell tits and ass do and lazy stereotypes do. And magazines who don't exploit people being compared to women being portrayed as weak and defenseless and the only thing that can save them is a big strong male is not accurate. Also not ALL (I'm saying this in all caps because he makes sure to tell you they are made for only men) men make up the gaming community. They are not all (only half)<b>  sex</b> crazed, emotionally stunted losers who think jacking off to the latest boob jiggle software is \"so awesome dude\". Women are also gamers, you do know that right? Sorry for my run on sentences and rant, hope you forgive me if you've made it this far which I doubt anyone will (and anyone who does is either a feminist or thinks that I'm <b> a feminaz</b>i).",

I, for instace, have been playing wildstar and I know a lot of people who don't play it just because of it's cartoony art. I didn't like dragon's crown artstyle, specially the female depictions, are you gonna make me think otherwise? No! Then stop being a jerk and learn that people have opinions. Supposing you are a gamer, then I am absolutely sure there is some genres you like more than others, some games you might pass on for whatever reason, even though they might be critically acclaimed games. Do I think you are stupid because of that? No: I think your attitude is stupid, and I'm sure you know that",

Oh, wait a minute, it's not! And you're wrong! Do I have to like every Pablo f'ing Picaso painting just beacuse he's one of the planet's most renowned artists now? Also, how can saying that the way women in general, in particular the sorcerer, are depicted in a way that are disgusting to me is different from saying that that game's artstyle disgust me? As far as i know an artist had to go and drawn those characters for them to be there, right? Or did they exist previously? of course they didn't so your argument is pointless: both assertations mean the same thing. Also WHY THE FUCK are you going on about freedom of speech man? When was I ever against it? So you and the developers are free to like watermelon sized boobs in your video games and I'M NOT? Have you thought that maybe the one who's trying to shut down my ideas is YOU? And, in the end, you must not take my comment out of context: I was replying to a guy that said that anyone that had a problem with the depiction of women in games was not a gamer and my comment was to prove him wrong. It WAS NOT to hate on the developers of dragons <b> crow </b>and say: \"mwaaaaaaaahh, I don't like titties, bad game, censor it\". I don't fucking care about the people who like dragons crown, as far as I know it's a good game, I just DON'T WANT TO PLAY IT! Can't you respect my opinion? Do you need to call me out on the internet and post comments to offend me and that tbh make no sense just because I have an opinion? What does that say about you? huh? Think about it, and then once you want to have a respectful mature fucking conversation: I'm all ears. Till then, I'm outta here douche.",

Unless you're the artist behind that design or he is a personal friend of yours you have no way of proving that that was the intention. Maybe it went something like: our target demographic is young males, this target audience likes overexaggerated depictions of female bodies, lets make boobs big. And maybe it wasn't. There's no point in even trying to guess because art is subjective. What may be interpreted by you as a celebration of the female body may be disgusting to me. Again: I don't have to like it, and that's what you don't seem to understand! All this time I've been totally OK with you opinion and even conceded time and time again that I know the game is acclaimed, but you keep goin on and on and on and on about how my opinion is wrong! Just stop, what is the point? Do you really expect me to convince me otherwise?\nAnd a game is not only an art piece it is also a product out in the market for comsumption and if it doesn't please me and don't have to give the developer my money just because Mr. Joshua Kelly on the internet told me to do so.",

However if that is the case I just wanna say that I understand where you're coming from, but that in your rage you weren't able to see that I was merely expressing my opinion and not calling for censorship or attacking artistic integrity. I wanna remind you, also, that although you may like the study of art, other people might not, but that doesn't invalidate their point of view, specially when your talking about a product destined to mass comsumption, like a video-game.\nI want to make this clear to you: I am not saying that the art team of that game was sexist or that they would be censored in any way. I am, in fact, an avid defender of everyone's right to express themselves, no matter how different their views might be from mine. I am just expressing my opinion on a game to prove someone who said \"If you really care so much about the size of a character's breasts or her clothing, you aren't much of a gamer in the first place\" was wrong, considering I do care and I am a gamer.",

Men should grow the fuck up and take responsibility for allowing themselves to buy into a culture that paints women as items to be protected, bought, used, and raped. It's disgusting. And using the excuse that men can't represent women correctly because they aren't women is ridiculous. You cannot honestly think that not understanding women is an accurate excuse for exploiting them?! \nThere are plenty of female gamers out there and maybe you could sell more games if you actually have a fuck about catering to a wider audience than just the preteen boys sitting home alone and masterbating.

There isn't much leg room for minorities or women to even get through the door to produce diverse media. Any content they create doesn't even get a chance because of opinions like yours.

                    "commentText": "\"special interest groups\" You mean people whom are consumers? People expressing what they'll spend money on should not be ignored because they're \"special interest groups\". That sounds like you are saying the opinions of women and minorities should be ignored because their opinions and wants aren't important, because they aren't mine. Women are 50% of the \"whole\" population. They consume half of everything as well. Minorities are a part of the population. If you ignore/dismiss half of the population and the people whom agree with them, it is easy to assume that \"majority\" thinks like you. If you exclude everyone you consider a \"special interest group\" then it is a club that you believe no one else should be a part of.\u00a0\n\nWhat do feminist or feminism have anything to do with making female and minority characters more diverse? Why is it such an offensive critique? Why does it make people so angry? Are women and minorities not people? I didn't know they were all colony type beings who acted and looked the same. Forgive my ignorance in not understanding why it is so difficult for the industry to portray people diversely. My brain can't comprehend why that is such an outlandish and offensive want in the products that I consume.-\n\nHow is it not <b> racism </b>or<b>  sexism</b>? Minority characters are often replaced with white actors. You can literally count the movies where a minority replaces a white character. The industries even argues for excluding minorities on the basis of \"historical accuracy\" yet white actors are a majority in most films regardless of place or era. There is enough evidence that show<b> s sexis</b>m a<b> nd raci</b>sm significantly reduces the chance o<b> f a wo</b>man or minority being hired. People prefer to hire a man <b> to a w</b>oman, people prefer to hire someone white over so<b> meone e</b>thnic. It isn't a matter of women and minorities not having talent, its a matter of no one thinking them capable or competent. It is a matter of not wanting to include them in the \"club\"\n\nThe sheer notion that minorities and women HAVE to go through different avenues because\u00a0 the industry won't accept t<b> hem IS </b>racist and sexist. To impl<b> y that </b>\"Nobody\" wants these t<b> hings </b>is crazy. Bee and Puppy cat is a great example of how the \"special interest groups\" DO want more diverse content, they DO want female creators and content makers. They DO want strong female characters. The success of Boondocks, the George Lopez show, the Cosby show, the Parkers, The fresh prince, Afro samurai, est ARE implications that diversity IS wanted and IS in demand. Simply ignoring \"special interest groups\" doesn't mean the demand isn't there. Only having ONE thing available to you doesn't mean that you will NEVER consume something el<b> se. It </b>IS racist and sexist to think that no one will be able to identify with a minority<b>  or wi</b>th a woman as lead DIVERSE characters. You automatically a<b> ssum</b>e their sex and their background will make them behave in a stereotypical caricature type <b> way. Th</b>at Is racist and sexist. You are saying no one wants to see \"them\". And by no one, you mean people like yourself.\n\nIT isn't being \"politically correct\" showing people on screen who exist in the real world. Including minorites and women into media isn't \"politically co<b> rrect\".</b> It IS racist and sexist to assume that including women and minorities into<b>  media </b>without racist or sexist monotony is being politically<b>  correc</b>t. It is racist and sexist to assume that including minorities or women into media is a \"Political statement\".\n\nOnce again I don't understand what feminism has to do with this. And quite frankly with your statements of \"special interest groups\" and \"The simple fact is that the demand doesn't exist\" already leads me to belie<b> ve that</b> you are\u00a0 racist/sexist, or just assume that people outside of your world/circle don't matter. As I said I don't understand people who get so pissed of about this. Perhaps you just enjoy the walking t<b> its, t</b>oken ghetto black guy, and asexual kung-fu Asian guy in your media 24/7. For t<b> he r</b>est of us, its old. In 2014 we expect something better.",

Listening to all that idiocy may have decreased my IQ a bit (cue insults). You need some serious perspective besides seeing everything in your experience. You can put yourself in other peoples shoes and you don't have to be that person, <b> gender,</b><b>  race</b>, etc to understand the experience even a little bit.\n\nThe idea that is easy for women to get into the gaming industry if they just did the necessary steps and applied is hilarious. \"All you have to do is this....\" Tell that to the women who did that. Or tell that to the women who are there and still find it difficult to be heard.\n\nBy your logic, doesn't it make MORE sense to cater to both men and women if women are interested in buying those same games? That would make them MORE money. You honestly think that men just want to se<b> e se</b>x in games? That they wouldn't appreciate a well told game even if there wasn<b> 't sexu</b>al overtones?\n\nMen should be expected to do a good job because it IS their job. They can do research and create fully realized worlds, but it is impossible to as<b> k a wo</b>man her opinion about her experience <b> as a w</b>oman? That really isn't difficult. Do you know that women used to write under make pseudonyms just to be taken seriously as authors....and they were. But, if it had their actual name, it would've have been thrown out? In these novels, they would write GREAT male characters, despite not being a male, yet; your excuse as to why men can't do it is because they aren't women and shouldn't be expected to do it. lol.\n\nMen don't feel threatened by women in the gaming industry, they quest<b> ion a </b>woman's capabilities, which is why feminists or, women in general, believe that th<b> eir is </b>sexism.\n\nBut, you're a white male that and you don't understand the privilege you have in this society. That you are automatically assumed to be qualified because <b> of your</b> ge<b> nder </b>and race opposed to women and other races even if they have the same qualifications or better. I'm not ca<b> lling y</b>ou racist, but that you do realize the privilege you have and the ignorance that you live in because of it.",

Anyone who cites the 45% 55% split as a reason to develop games for both genders is misled, as the statistics themselves are misleading.\n\nWomen play more casual games, such as browser based or smartphone based games. There's <b> nothing </b>wrong with that. The problem comes when women come out and complain that triple A titles or whatever games (of which they were never the target market) should pander to them because \"we are gamers too!\".\n\nDo you really think that if publishers knew of a way to market products to their consumer base + female gamers, they wouldn't have already done so? In reality, if they were to make a game intended for a greater female audience, it would be of the more casual variety and not a triple A title. After all, that's where the majority of female consumers are. (But no one seems to be complaining about casual games so I'll move on).\n\nWhat female games really want, or at least how I understand it, are more titles not for smartphones but for consoles or PC targeted at them. Sure, but designing such a game has its ramifications. One of which is losing out on their traditional consumer base. By changing the intended market, some people are lost and some people are gained. The publishers must see that the male gamer sales they lose must be less than the number of female gamer sales they gain (this is obviously a GROSS oversimplification but you get the point). Publishers must see that selling these games is more profitable than just marketing towards their already established consumer base.\n\n\"But we don't want these games made to pander to us, we just want games to not portray women in a misogynistic and debasing fashion. Maybe that way more women will join in on what we consider 'hardcore' games.\" This is really the strongest argument female gamers have, and it's a good one too. But that's all it is, an argument. What female games need to give are not arguments, but money. Have female friends who play casual games? Maybe tell them to try some other, less casual games cause I'm not asking girls who play angry birds to run some instances with me. They always give me the weirdest looks.\n\nPublishers see marketing<b>  gender</b> neutral games in <b> a gende</b>r neutral fashion as a bad idea. Why? If you're marketing to everyone, you're marketing to no one. High profile games evenly enjoyed by both genders (I know I kn<b> ow gend</b>er binary blah blah shut up) and both general types of gamers (hardcore and casual) are very rare. I don't know if I can even name one. The point is, games that do not portray what male audiences enjoy (but what female audiences are offended by) lose sales from the male audience, and publishers aren't about to market games to include an audience that was not traditionally in their consumer base. \"But women are a par-\" no. High profile games' consumer base is mostly male. Women who play farmville are obviously not the target audience of something like Dark Souls 2 or a lot of other titles. Now the topic of whether guys should enjoy things that offend women is a different topic, and not one I'll talk about. It's also not the publisher's problem.\n\nSo, in the end, what can we do? I dun<b> no. Sex</b>ism in gaming is a real issue, but publisher's aren't about to take on huge risks and perhaps lose millions of dollars. In the end, what female gamers need to give aren't arguments, but hundred dollar bills. Tell these companies you're willing to pay, or, even better, take this guy's advice and make a game yourself. This, at least how I see it, is the right approach. Now the wrong approach would be to make videos about games and criticize them for portraying women poorly and how they should pander more towards women. That's fucking moronic.

But I for once really enjoy actual games (like shooting games for example- since they don't really go into <b> gender </b>I don't really care about the<b>  gender</b> of my character, but mostly games with complex stories or story based in general).\nI think, for example, games like \"the last of us\", \"beyond two souls\", \"the walking dead\" etc. are a great step forward- They tell a good story that would make any player interested, and that's the key in my opinion. If they create a game with a female lead that's actually generally interesting, I don't see how people wouldn't like them- regardless o<b> f gende</b>r. The trophy in a game can easily be a million things (and not an actual person), the women in the game can have reasonable bodily proportions (which has been more prevalent in some recent games). There're several easy changes that have been made in several games that didn't compromise their ability to sell, it's just a slow, gradual process.\nAlso, I think there is a growing interest in gaming for females caused by the vast popularity of gaming youtubers, that are followed by both female and male viewers- The gamers in the videos give them a more accessible way to actually see games in progress and see why they can be interesting for females too (take into consideration games have evolved a lot in the past few years and this is a great way to show how gaming in general isn't that \"male\" or \"scary\"). I think games in recent years have shown some progress with the portrayal of female characters, making the critique of games with mor<b> e \"o</b>ld fashioned\" female roles easier to critique- Like the good ol' \"damsel in distress\" that is getting more tiring than \"selling\"- Even female \"sidekicks\" have actualy active roles in the game (like Elisabeth in Bioshock infinite, who's helping him pick doors and brings supplies, and also takes care of herself in battle. She's still a sidekick and somewhat of a damsel, but she has a personality and a story that exceed that and make her \"rescue\" not quite the usual rescue, but let's not go there as I have a lot to say about this game, which I generally love). \u00a0\nI think the publishers are slowly seeing that good stories sell in general, and that process is what is making them more and more \"unisex\". Being innovative isn't just about the graphics anymore. I don't agree unisex doesn't sell- because it's <b> not bl</b>ack and white. Games that are m<b> ore \"ge</b>nder neutral\" have been selling for years (not just casual games)- Like shooting games, smaller indie titles, horror-monster-types etc.\nThere's 10 times more female awareness to gaming and the numbers are not declining, so I say- I think there's a future in gaming for games that won't be as offensively \"male only\".\nAlso, games like \"the Stanley parable\" or \"Portal\" for example show that there's more than one way to tell a story, keep the player engaged, or to play a game. But that goes beyond<b>  just g</b>ender- It also redefined the purpose of gaming.",

That's an inescapable cycle unless acted on by a force external to the market.\n\nAnd I've still yet to see any sources cited on what female gamers typically play, but that \"casual games\" assumption is thrown around an awful lot by us male gamers without much evidence to substantiate that claim. Even that aside, who is to decide what games are or are not \"hardcore\"? That's a completely subjective term.\n\nI also don't think marketing a game like Skyrim, Mass Effect, or Dragon <b> Age </b>(ie. triple A titles) with a female default protagonist would have had a marked impacted on sales. Historically, advertisement and marketing reflect the general attitude of the majority of a given audience....and boy are gamers sure resistant to change. I don't think the various marketing strategies reflect a financially-based decision to exclude female characters from advertising and development, it's just a different way of doing things....and gamers don't like different.\n\nSo it actually does fall to developers to take the risks first because whoever does it right....is gonna make a s***load of money. ;)",

Which means, and I'm sure you can agree the following is also true, there is no evidence to substantiate the claim it is NOT mostly \"casual games\". We just don't know either way at this point but neither of us in the absence of evidence can argue one over the other.\u00a0\nWhat we do have evidence for from your earlier link to The ESA is that adult females have gaming careers just under 25% shorter than males (13 years vs. 17). We also know that the female gaming population is 82% of the male gaming population (from your 45/55 ratio). So by tailoring a game to men these companies take advantage of a significantly larger market (18%) for a significantly extended period of time (25% longer gaming career).\nI completely agree there is money to be made in designing games for and marketing to women. However, it's a business with the objective to make the most money possible (most businesses anyway). Why would they take limited resources (employees, and money) from teams designing games for a larger target market and assign them to less profitable ventures. By taking resources away from the products being designed for the larger target market you also lessen the quality of the end product and risk alienating/losing support of this larger market.\u00a0\nThe fact is if a business invests, arbitrary and likely unrealistic amount I don't know, $1 million and designs a game for women or takes that same $1 million and designs a game for men. Who am I making more profit off of? I'm going with men every time, no homo (not that there's anything wrong with that). The market is already there why invest resources in trying to develop a lesser market.\nI'm not trying to argue I'm just spitballing ideas from the other perspective. I completely agree if someone stuck there head out to develop the market, there could be a huge reward and other companies would jump on board. The problem is no one wants to invest in the work and take that initial loss vs. solely reap the reward.\u00a0\nEdits: to $1 million, capitalized NOT (for clarity purposes, even tried to bold underline it-wouldn't let me) Watch out youtube I incidentally learned how to bold!",

My own experience has also lead to expect that most multiplayer participants are male as those with mic capabilities seems to support that assumption. However I would also say that 90%+ of the female gamers I run into have specifically stated they avoid speaking online (giving away their <b> gender)</b> for just that reason. Hell, it's been talked about to death in various gaming-related communities, but the amount of harassment and abuse female players receive is just one more glaring reason it can be so difficult to entice more women to even play games in the first place.\n\nSo I guess my ultimate question is who makes the first move? Should we just keep on keeping on because it works, but still sexistly (yay made up words lol) broken? I mean it sells after all, right?\n\nI'm still of the opinion that only minor changes to advertising are really needed and just more thoroughly well-rounding female characters is ultimately one of the better strategies. It's slow, but it gives our more aggressively defensive/sexist/change-resistant comrades to come around. I think that's what's been so interesting about the discussion taking place right now about the representation of women in gaming. Most people agree that it's changing for the better, but when someone starts highlighting the issue faster than our stubborn collective butts are ready to handle, people can get really indignant.",

I'm well aware that female gamers make a significant percentage (though I remain skeptical about the 45/55 argument), and it's exactly because female gamers are getting vocal that you're seeing changes being made.\n\nBut the problem remains with your original analogy - games are for gamers, magazines are for readers.\n\nYou subsequently drill down - women's health magazines are for women.\n\nTo which I would respond, shooters are for FPS gamers - which are predominantly male.\n\nCasual games are for casual gamers - which are fairly<b>  gender</b> neutral.\n\nSo rounding back to my original point - your distinction* is problematic because it is simply far too vague.\n\nAnd you cannot argue that if the game is designed and marketed with male consumers in mind, it's not the essence. It IS the essence. The main core of a game, or even a magazine, is to be entertaining for its target audience, not to be simply \"entertaining.\"\n\nA magazine marketed at women and designed with women in mind - Cosmo in this case - becomes its very essence.

All in all, female gamers seem to prefer e.g. in-game communication and plot, i.e. MMORPG or other roleplaying games, like WoW or Second Life. Female players govern maybe 20 to 25% of WoW players.\nI'm not saying there isn't a significant amount of gaming girls&women. I'm saying there're less in the \"sexist\" part of the industry.",

But any women who are dicks won't make it in gaming whilst smart productive women still have to handle the huge amount of male dicks. \n\nExample: It's proven women are worse at arguing for raises than men, hence payment discrepancy. The question is then WHY are they worse? How can we prevent it? \nWomen arn't victims, nor are they lazy.",

I agree with you there, but there are also devs that throw the games that you want so much. The question is how to increase the prevalence of games like that. That's a battle I would support.",

That means one gets cut scenes between action in which one can just watch instead of interact or in worst case combat becomes the solution for everything, like kill the girl if she is infected/cursed or whatever or even just if she talks too much. I would love to see games with dialog options in which I can avoid every combat...",

With more detailed main characters but still flat female characters, who still with all the cut scenes are just pretty to look at but have no character of their own.

There are great novels and movies with female protagonists that male audiences read and watch, without it having to be made just by women. So, why not video games too?",

It has been targeted towards males for decades, and often resulted in enthusiasts being looked down upon and bullied simply for enjoying it. Now it is a huge industry, and the stigma towards people who play videogames has been lifted. Because of this, women wanted a piece of the pie, and instead of actively trying to produce quality products they complain that the industry isn't targeted towards them.",

Either way there's so many titles not aimed at any <b> gender </b>that I find the argument invalid. If you don't like a game don't play it.
