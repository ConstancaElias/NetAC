Like, why do you think PETA roll around naked in plastic wrap outside the parliament? It's to get attention, stupid! Once you have the attention then you can deliver your message. Without attention, it doesn't really matter how interesting your argument is. Also, since the conservative women are keeping their mouths shut to not offend any men by mistake, what are they expected to do if you do give them attention? Finally, since conservative women have no opinions of their own, they are just parroting their husbands opinions, there is really no particular reason to get hearsay from them when you can get straight to the source instead. That said, conservative wimminz do end up in the news every now and then;\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwZJ55g80Q\n\nEdit: Also, is this bitch using the language of feminists to shit on feminists?

Don't let them.\" this quote I do agree with, and that is where I disagree with you, however it feels extremely ignorant to those Republican and conservative views that do exactly that. I think that's my point. I don't think conservatives are worth listening to. However it depends on their views if these are relevant to the context of the debate. When discussing how to get women the fair rights they deserve, a voice that helps distinguish what rights do and don't already exist and to what degree this goal can be fulfilled at all may be helpful. A voice that says there is no problem and that we should not even bother with the topic or that says we actually need a movement in the other direction, that voice would not be helpful and only hinder a reasonable establishing of what we can or should do.",

I'll add a Fun Fact I doubt many conservatives know. When the Supremes heard the Casey Martin case, in which a golfer with a birth condition got though Q-school to earn a PGA Tour card and then sued to force the PGA to let him ride in a cart instead of walk the course, Ms O'Connor was the only one among the judges who had ever scored a hole in one.\n\nIt is true that most of the conservative men I know are quick to mock leftist women's appearance or claim they have all the good looking ones on their side.\n\nI remember the video maker as a recurring panelist on To the Contrary, a PBS Sunday-morning pundit programme with an all-female panel that ran about 2.5-1.5 leaning left. The most frequent panelist I can recall was Julianne Malveaux, who was the first person I heard to declare that Mr Gingrich's magnum opus ought to be called the Contract ON America.",

    "commentText": "\"to balance things out\". Yep, just like when a magazine features a trans woman once in a long while to balance things out. I do agree that having trans and conservative people in these types of magazines more often would be great instead of creating a standard for themselves (to be fair, this is exaggerated considering that there are more conservative than trans women, this is not meant as direct comparison) however the state can't determine what they present, in neither case. It isn't bullying (they aren't actively misrepresenting you) but you can advocate for them to include more conservative, or trans, models yet it is their choice in the end. The standard represented in these types of media can be hurtful, which is part of some feminist movements when for example advocating for more models of different body types, through the standards they set, which is why it is reasonable to advocate for change in those regards. This can however neither be demanded nor is it legally wrong. The thing that I find even more interesting though is that conservative representation in a strictly visual medium (unless what you advocate for is more interviews with conservatives and more conservative authors in them, yet she referred to models only) is kind of pointless. No girl is going to look at a woman who is conservative, unless she is explicitly stated to be, and think 'so it's okay for me to be conservative in my views even if I am a woman? I can be excepted for it' because you don't see a woman's political views. Then again there also already is almost a third of all Americans who are conservative and since political views are a choice they likely wouldn't be if they weren't accepted for it, so this representation might not be required for them to be accepted, or maybe it is, I don't know. In any case the liberal women are also not typically marked as liberals in these magazines, so why should the conservatives be. To be fair, articles might talk about their feminist endeavours but, again, I don't think it talked about articles that represent a conservative view point in this video and conservative women could also hold feminist views so some of these articles written by or about left leaning women could have just as well been written by right or center political ladies, their political standing would not be apparent from the texts themselves.",

The reality is that all those meagre initiatives have crashed and burned. Or fizzled out. Their target market doesn't even care for their own shit, if it's not some hyperbolic borderline schizotypal sprinkling of references. Having right wingers in media is commercial suicide. Money talks. They ain't worth it. It's a hard pill to swallow. Usually red. (Right wingers are entangled with media images. More than against the left, they react to commercial psychological warfare (media doesn't represent the left). Or, as I like to say: right wingers hate right wingers too.)",

I usually don't give up because I am very willing to engage with the other side and trying to prove how their worldview is wrong.

You haven't proven your claim but you've certainly proven you're delusional, \" You didn't give me a study retard,\" I guess you also can't read?

You have the audacity to tell me I need to learn how to read and stop spamming things I don't understand, when you don't even have basic comprehension skills. When did I say \" You don't accept trans people,\"? I said \" You won't accept it,\" in reference to the study. I said you changed the subject from other people not accepting trans people to their suicide rates, them not accepting themselves has nothing to do with other people accepting them, thus it's a red herring.\n\nYou're making the active claim that trans people commit suicide because they are mentally ill, thus shifting the burden of proof onto you.\n\n I then made the active claim that bullying and discrimination is why they have such high rates of suicide, providing a professional study done by a professional institute that proves you wrong, not some random study anyone can find online. And you can't accept being wrong, you've convinced yourself you're right and you can't change your mind, you need to fit in with what other people think. Therefore, I've proven you wrong and all you've done is admit you don't actually care about facts. \n\nTell me, where is the proof for anything you've said? You haven't given a single fact and you've denied my facts, you're not stupid enough to think a professional study is based on feelings are you? It's factual information obtained by data sampling, basic Secondary School stuff. Therefore, the study is objectively factual. So you've denied facts",

So no far from having no arguments  we have all the arguments and the only arguments that are relevant or  matter the scientific  .  all you have is conspiracy theories  and denialism and personnel opinions   just like flat earthers and young earth creationists . So much for being about facts and logic you can't even identify the difference between valid reasoning and a logical fallacy .",

The only thing you can't change are chromosomes - and guess what, they're not always just xy for men and xx for women. Some people have xxy. Some women have xy chromosomes (for example those born with CAIS), and so on.\nAnd if you still say gender and sex is a binary because intersex people are exceptions or something: Would you say there's only 3 hair colours (blonde, brown and black), just because less than 2% of the world's population have red hair?",

This would be things like anarchism, communism, socialism, etc etc. Liberals, by and large, are comfortable with the exploitive nature of capitalism, and even if they sometimes argue in favor of making things better for marginalized groups within this system (depending on which liberals), they fail to recognize the systemic harm to well being that capitalism creates by necessity to preserve the current overall heirarchal inequality. They prefer a negative peace and are comfortable with the status quo, but sometimes will speak out for comparatively small changes that wouldn't uproot the status quo at large, usually once corporate interests align towards monetizing those changes. This can be summed up in those memes where every word is separated by clapping hand emotes. Compare and contrast to conservatives, who also support corporate interests over the individuals, but are also more traditionally entrenched anti-egalitarian values. They fight against literally any attempt to move forward progress wise.\n\nI think it helps to remember that the left-right spectrum is generally relative to the status quo, too. Being left of absolute monarchists isn't exactly all that different from being a conservative (actual conservatives btw not fascists playing pretend so they can recruit) today because conservatives can and are, at least officially, left of absolute monarchists and feudalism, since the traditions they fight for are the ones rooted in modern thought that has by and large rejected absolute monarchism and feudalism in favor of capitalism, which was rooted in egalitarian values when it started cropping up. Obviously, things change, capitalism is now the dominant means of societal organization. As such, left and right as relevant to the status quo have also changed.\n\nObviously though, it's kinda hard to pin down an objective measure of what constitutes left vs right that accounts for every single variation of political thought, hence why there's a million different contradicting political charts and graphs. I do acknowledge that. I just think that leftism as it is now refers primarily to anti-capitalist, anti-state, egalitarian positions. Liberalism just ain't it. Unless you're a conservative, of course, because leftism is an easy boogeyman to pin all societal problems on when one can strawman it hard enough.",

We're talking about the word as it's used now, in the circles i mentioned earlier. It seems odd to use the context of where the word started off without considering how the meaning has changed to reflext the values of today. If we ignore all modern context, the fuckload of leftist philosophy that's come out and carved a niche for itself, and the way that has shaped politics, we would have to assert that modern conservatives are leftists, because, as i said, they are left of absolute monarchists.\nNo one does this. Conservatives don't call themselves leftists, they blame the left for every problem that exists literally ever to make their obsession with preserving all heirarchal and moral values that they advocate for look good. To ignore this fact that exists today because liberalism is left of absolute monarchists just doesn't make sense to me at all.\n\nAlso, slightly different note, can you like, not misinterpret what I'm saying? You went on this gigantic tangent to imply that I'm asserting that words don't have objective definitions. I'm not saying they don't. I'm saying that context also matters. If you go into the leftist groups i mentioned earlier, liberals are gonna seen as right wing. Left of conservatives in terms of the pursuit of a more egalitarian society  but not left of the center (capitalism). The n word is a perfect example of context mattering. Without context, it just means \"a black person\". With context it becomes either a perjorative due to the systems that reinforce heirarchies which are reaponsible for said hard, or a term of endearment. It fundamentally becomes different in meaning even though the definition stays the same. To answer your hypothetical, i believe that if the systemic constructs that harm people based on race stop being a supported thing, then the n word will no longer cause the harm it did, because the thing that gave it its power would no longer exist except as a historical occurence, which would, incidentally, have to include things like privilege. Kinda hard for there to be privileged whites in a society where constructs and environmental factors no longer reinforce the harmful elements of a word. When this comes to pass, it would probably live on as a term of endearment, because that's a thing that exists now. Or maybe it wouldn't. It really doesn't matter one way or the other. What matters is that the harmful meaning wouldn't have any weight, and would likely cease being relevant.\n\nPlease, stop pretending that only definition matters when we interpret language. It's dishonest as fuck to misinterpret what someone is arguing in order to defeat that argument instead of the original, and reeks of predatory intent. That's not something I'm okay with enabling.",

Your op was arguing that liberalism is on the left of the political spectrum, which may be true, but doesn't negate the fact that liberalism as an ideological descriptor is different from leftism as an ideological descriptor. You didn't really respond to the comment expanding on the differences -- do you not think drawing a distinction between capitalist and anti-capitalist matters?\n\n\n\"So at what point do you, and all you who think this way, believe we should stop using words the way they are generally used?\" \n\n\nI would agree that most people use leftism incorrectly, but I think you're failing to take into account the fact that leftism itself is pretty fringe. Your examples of \"troll\" and the N word are not applicable because although they have history, at the end of the day they're simply pejorative descriptors rather than terms that indicate schools of academic and intellectual thought and therefore have utilitarian value. Your argument only works if you're of the mind that there is no utility to discussing any concept outside of that which is accepted by the mainstream, because that's the point of the leftist/liberal distinction. It definitely does makes sense for you to take as a liberal though, if you want to push leftism outside the realm of consideration and seem more radical than you are.\n\n\nSo a counter question to you would be: At what point do anti-capitalists, as a fringe ideology, stop drawing distinctions between ourselves and capitalist liberals simply because (depending of the context) liberals are sometimes left of center, and because the smooth-brains on Fox News don't know the difference anyway?\n\n\nThat was actually rhetorical -- I'm gonna presume your answer is \"immediately.\"",

This video in itself shows self victimisation and seems to approve of affirmative action, you can't promote someone simply because they are republican. \n\nThey made another video complaining that right wing people were being denied private media platforms despite the fact these platforms are allowed to have whatever content they want on their site and PragerU quite literally making a video saying private businesses can deny anyone service. Then comes their illogical videos about God and religion, and stating we should engage in civil discourse despite arguing that leftists shouldn't be debated with. \n\nLiberals are not leftists by the way, don't confuse them. Instead of focusing on an overblown minority, try to understand that these liberals do contribute to society. Conservative values are often inefficient in my opinion, take their aversion to universal healthcare. Are you saying all they do is sit at home and whine about things they don't understand?",

The problem lies in liberals losing ths plot and focusing on identity politics has hurt the left, in ths DNC debate they asked if they'd give free healthcare to ilegal immigrants, that should have bothered everyone. How can we have a more egalitarian society when politicians don't have their constituents at heart, but wanna give healthcare to non citizens. They're trying to make up for their guilt of being the party of the KKK. When you have Google employees and Jack Dorsey saying they have a bias against more right leaning folks. When a woman gets banned from Twitter for saying \"Men aren't women though\" then Nothing happens to Kathy Griffin for calling for the death of the Covington kids after the media made it seem they harrassed a liar who's stolen valor. PJW Alex Jone get kicked off of Facebook. That doesn't show that there's clear bias?",
