        "postText": "'Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has been labelled the Trump of the tropics, has denied he harbours extreme fascist views and attempted to paint himself as a Brazilian Churchill.', 'Mrs May opted to break a long-standing political protocol by deciding not to call Mr Bolsonaro after he was elected - as is customary when world leaders come to power.', 'Number 10 announced the Prime Minister intended to send a letter, instead, as she gave the new Brazilian commander-in-chief the British cold shoulder.', 'But US President Donald Trump was not happy.', 'The firebrand Republican was quick to rush to Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s defence, tweeting: We agreed that Brazil and the United States will work closely together on trade, military and everything else!', 'Mr Bolsonaro replied: We wish to bring these two great nations closer together and to advance on the path of freedom and prosperity.', 'Trump revealed he\u2019d exchanged excellent words with Mr Bolsonaro after he called to congratulate him earlier this week.', 'In the wake of his election, Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s opponents clashed with law enforcement in Sao Paulo - a liberal, cosmopolitan centre.', 'A scourge of politically motivated violence also plagued Brazil throughout the campaign in defiance of Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s extreme and controversial policies and opinions.', 'The Trump-like figure has vowed to make it easier to own firearms and has called for police to have more autonomy to shoot at criminals.', 'He is also staunchly against the legalisation of abortion and environmentalists fear his policies could wreak havoc on Brazil\u2019s delicate and important eco-system.', 'In his victory speech, he said: We cannot continue flirting with communism.We are going to change the destiny of Brazil. ', 'The commitment I made to the Brazilian people was to create a decent government and I guarantee you that I will. ', ' Mr Bolsonaro experienced a sudden and rapid rise to power spearheaded by a rejection of the leftist Workers Party(PT). ', ' PT ran Brazil for 13 of the last 15 years and presided over rampant corruption and successive impeachments. ', ' But the party was ousted two years ago as a political scandal and a deep recession gripped the South American nation. ', ' Strident lawmaker Mr Bolsonaro surged in popularity amid the Brazilian people\u2019 s increasing disillusionment with corruption in politics.', 'Mr Bolsonaro, who compared his campaign to Trump's 2016 run, has dismissed as fake news accusations of sexism, racism and homophobia levelled against him.', 'The hard-line politician, who has campaigned on an anti-socialist stance, vows an unforgiving crackdown on crime and political corruption as he attempts to win over the disenfranchised Brazilian electorate.'",

I was tonight talking to my transexual Brazilian neighbour who just got back from Brazil where she was having work done for her transition. Her attitude is that he's a homophobe, a racist &amp; a misogynist i refrained from taking up any argument with her at this point, being keen to hear her thoughts, however - and i thought this was an extremely interesting opinion - she said that he is for Brazilians like chemotherapy, required to remove the cancer which has taken over their nation. They are willing to give the chemo a shot, no matter how hard chemo will be, because the crime, murder, mafia gangs &amp; absolute corruption is destroying their nation. You have NO idea how some people have to live do you ? One of my old friends raised in the favelas has 6 bullet holes in him, all received before he was 12 years old.It 's not a joke to these people that their country is a cesspit of crime, out of control murder &amp; total &amp; complete rotten corruption, but you sit there sneering at their attempt to try at least to bring some semblance of normality &amp; sanity to their screwed up world.",

The past \"Far Left\" party has plunged this country into the worst financial crisis in thirty yers, unemployment above 12%, they,re responsible for the largest corrution scandal in this country,s history. It,s difficult to keep track of the number of politicians currently in prison, or soon to be there, including the ex President, with his Vice President being impeached. Yet Mr. Bolsonarro only won by 10%. This should spek volumes about the average IQ of socialists, and Ms. May chooses to snub the will of the people for spurnig business as usual and desiring a radical change of direction. what on earth is wrong with her?BTW crime is out of control, people are murdered for cell phones, I,d say it,s time to get tough on crime. no.",

Our countries are being changed beyond all recognition and it's a disgrace. I am not being<b>  racist</b> or xenophobic yadda yadda but I DO want to see us get an evil ideology out of our country and be able to be proud to be white and British again.
