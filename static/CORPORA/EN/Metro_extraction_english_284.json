        "postText": "British Muslims are launching their first ever pride festival at a time when the community is \u2018under attack more than ever\u2019.', 'The festival hopes to celebrate what it means to be LGTBQI and Muslim and how they do \u2018not have to choose\u2019 between both identities.', 'LGBTQI charity Imaan is putting on the event to mark the 20 years it\u2019s spent supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans Muslims.', 'The show of solidarity follows ongoing anti-LGBT education protests outside primary schools in Birmingham.', 'Some Muslim parents expressed outrage at relationship and sex education (RSE) being taught as part of the national Equality Act.', 'Several parents launched a campaign against the educational materials, claiming it is an affront to their religious beliefs, specifically targeting the \u2018No Outsiders\u2019 programme and its creator Andrew Moffat.', 'Lesbian campaigner Anjum Mauj said the \u2018furore\u2019 over RSE is bringing out more homophobia in the Muslim community.', 'She told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Homophobes are being emboldened by lack of leadership anywhere so Imaan is stepping into that position.', '\u2018The current political climate, together with Brexit, migrant crisis, Boris, and Trump has emboldened Islamophobes too.', '\u2018As LGBTQI Muslims we are caught in the middle.', '\u2018On the occasion of our 20th anniversary it\u2019s a very apt time to celebrate with a LGBTQI Muslim festival and celebrate our unique identities and bring some joy into the world.\u2019', 'Anjum, who is a trustee at Imaan, said it\u2019s absolutely vital to have an LGTBQI voice for Muslims.', 'She said: \u2018We have thousands of members at Imaan and many of them are not able to come out.', '\u2018When I was growing, we were just not having conversations about sex and relationships.', '\u2018So to then talk about sexual orientation or something else was hugely problematic.', '\u2018I was out to my family from a very young age and when I made the decision to get married to my partner, my mother was very upset about it.', '\u2018She didn\u2019t want to tell the rest of her Muslim community. And she still is in that zone of \u201cwhat will the community say?\u201d', '\u2018I\u2019ve grown up in a really loving and vibrant and inclusive community so it\u2019s very painful to feel that I need to hide part of myself.\u2019', 'Imaan said it is turning to its wider friends and communities to make the event possible, by raising funds online.', 'They are planning to feature panels, discussions, speakers, arts, culture and history.', 'To donate, head to Imaan\u2019s Crowdfunder page.",

First world countries have separated the church from the state so even if Christians wanted to put homosexuals to death (noting that it only refers to MEN in the Bible, not women/lesbians) they could not legally do so.  Go to a majority Muslim country and see how you get on with that one.  Islam is a barbaric, heathen and violent political and religious ideology.  It has no place in Britain.",
