        "postText": "An anti-LGBT protester has returned to the gates of a primary school in Birmingham, demanding an end to LGBT books and discussions, despite a council letter warning him about his behaviour.', 'Protester Shakeel Afsar has been leading protests for five weeks at the school gates, which he says offend most of the school\u2019s mainly Muslim parents.', 'The 32-year-old property developer, who does not have children at the school, says he has received death threats and messages from people angry at his stance, which he claims he has passed on to police.', 'He said: \u2018I am scared and wary of anyone, but at the same time I will not back down \u2013 it\u2019s too important.\u2019', 'He also claimed parents were now considering a mass withdrawal of pupils at the end of next week if the school \u2018does not compromise.\u2019', 'Last week, Birmingham City Council\u2019s anti-social behaviour team issued a warning letter setting out strict rules about Mr Afsar\u2019s behaviour at the school.', 'The terms included not to: \u2018Attend the school in Dennis Road, Sparkbrook,(or nearby) and attempt to interfere verbally or physically with a member of staff or service user.', 'They also warned Mr Afsar \u2018not to obstruct or interfere with persons accessing, passing or visiting the school.\u2019', 'However, Mr Afsar said he was keeping to the strict rules of the warning, but would continue to exercise his right to protest, backed by legal advice.', '\u2018It is with great regret and a heavy heart that we feel we have no choice but to return to protest,\u2019 he said.', 'He claimed attempts at mediation, led by internationally renowned human rights lawyer Nazir Afzal, had faltered so far because, he claimed, the school had not \u2018met him halfway\u2019.', 'Mr Afsar said: \u2018We asked, in the spirit of conciliation, for the school to suspend all LGBT material and anything else that might cause controversy while they consulted with parents, and also asked that all bans on parents involved in the protests be lifted.', '\u2018There was a deadline of noon on Thursday May 9 and they did not come to us, so protests have now resumed.\u2019', 'Headteacher Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson said she was \u2018disgusted, disappointed and frustrated\u2019 that Mr Afsar was seeking to \u2018hold the school to ransom.\u2019', 'She said mediation was continuing \u2013 but just not with the involvement of Mr Afsar.', '\u2018Mr Afsar is not a parent of a child at this school,\u2019 she said.', '\u2018It is utterly insulting that he is encouraging parents to think there is a possibility that he can dictate what we do and do not do.', '\u2018He is trying to hold us to ransom and adopt mob rule.\u2019', 'Mrs Hewitt-Clarkson said mediation was continuing between the school, council representatives, human rights lawyer Nazir Afzal and a group of parents, with more talks taking place on Monday.', 'A Birmingham City Council spokesperson added: \u2018Mr Afsar is not a parent or legal guardian of a child at the school, which is why he is not a part of the mediation process \u2013 it has not broken down, he is simply not a part of it for this reason.\u2019', 'When questioned on his views on homosexuality, Mr Afsar said he was tolerant and accepting of people who were LGBT and respected their rights and lifestyle, \u2018I am not homophobic,\u2019 he said.', 'But he said he did not want his children, he has two young daughters, to be subject to \u2018promotion of homosexuality\u2019.', 'When quizzed further, he said he would not be supportive if any of his children declared they were gay.",

            "commentText": "There's some disconnect about using a human rights lawyer in reference to being a minority and at the same instance arguing for special pleading based on a majority religious view at the school. If society was run by the same standards then it would set to specifically marginalise such people instead of the protections free nations such as ours provide. Even as a democracy and a majority we understand the need to support those who's views, values, culture, sexuality or <b> gender </b>identity differ from our own. However we cannot be complicit in creating isolation or indoctrination, so whilst people may hold whatever religious view they have it doesn't mean we need to provide for that view.There is a significant difference between religious morality and that of a secular society. One is based on the dangerous dogmatic unyielding premises of the past and the other evolves as humanity grows and begins to understand the complexity of our relationships with each other. It is indeed<b>  homophobic</b> to petition against what a person is in terms of their sexuality as it is a fundamental part of their being, it is lawful and moral as deemed by years of anguished research and legal fighting, however a person's belief or faith - whilst relevant to them it not something which is fundamentally part of them. Faith, no matter how strongly held, does not equate truth.We can teach our children what it is to live in a world \"where\" people are different to them... or. We can teach children what is it to live in a world \"with\" people who are different to them. For that to happen the parents of these children need to see beyond ideology.",
