Maybe not all of Qataris are treating domestic helper like they are not human beings but majority of them are abusive, sadistic employers. Maybe it is God's will that Qatar will be subjected to an economic blockade since 2017 by Saudi Arabia and it's friends. Imagine a violator of human rights imposing a blockade against another human rights violator. Let's see until karma take it's toll.",

They consider them as slaves. Sometimes they are not even given the right to explain if mistakes are made. Some Arab parents are tolerating on the bad attitudes of their  children. I have seen and been observing it. Binding agreements are only in paper but not followed. Domestic workers are working till early morning without extra pay. No service fee if they decided to go home for good. They are not thinking that we do played an important role in their lives...Even though we are domestic helpers we do have the right to be given fair treatment. ....",

However, over 14 centuries ago, Islam gives the women right to personal ownership and wealth. \n\nIslam gives them the right of inheritence whereas in some cultures, women are considered objects to be inherited. Without her, the future generation would lack the healthy moral conscience that is needed for success and stability of any individual and community. Professionalism, hard work and loving commitment are the natural skills that a<b>  woman</b> as a mother, imparts. However Muslim women are free to pursue employment if they are able to, and with the agreement of their husbands if married. History is witness to Muslim women's contribution to civilisation in various professions such as teaching, medicine and other fields. \n\nParadise lies at the feet of their mothers. \nMay Allah inshallah guide the maids and victims to Sunni Hanafi the authentic and true version of Islam and ultimately to paradise.",

On the other hand such evil practices happen under Islam.<b> \nQuran</b> teaches hatred and violence and commands Muslims to kill non believers and Infidels.\nThis is the reason the Arabs have no respect for other people and races and dehumanize people who are not Muslims.\nIt's clear therefore that the Jewish/Christian God is not the same as the Islamic Allah.\nIslamic Allah is false god, he teaches you to kill non believers. Only a false/fake god can incite violence against non-believers.\nThe Jewish/Christian God teaches Love, Peace, Humility, Meekness, Morality, Uprightness and forebearance.",

While American slaves got their freedom and eventually even one  became President, all <b> black </b>slaves (East Africans mainly) were first castrated then always killed off and that's why they don't exist there. The grand children of these slave masters inherited the murderous spirit and reason for this kind of treatment. Allah is Satan, and is the only description of the reason for the rampant murderous hearts against others. So evil, so diabolic, so wicked, so inhuman, so despicable, so deplorable, so demonic.

There are horror stories everywhere from maids from Africa and other countries. Some even have to be helped to go back to their countries than stay under hellish conditions. A <b> Black </b>Muslim is treated wayyyyy better in the uk and other European countries than their own Muslim brothers and sisters in the gulf. Why? The only reason some of them are coming to your countries is to make decent lives for their families back home. You have been blessed with wealth and gold and diamonds and flashy cars and sky scrapers in this world but REMEMBER Walahi kullu nafsin zaikatul maut(every soul shall have a taste of death) and indeed you will return to Your Maker. Most of you might be aware of this issue but silently stand by, you will be questioned insha  Allah. No condition is permanent and there are TOO MANY complaints! God is not sleeping. Wasalam",

It's just may be this lady's bad luck to get this kind of family  who treat her bad. But we had good & bad in every country, even in my country we have good & bad. Why this lady can't go to her embassy & complain or stop working for such people. Why she has to complain about her story here, & spoil the country's name & reputation, I don't agree. This is bad way of telling your problume here & blaming the country, & now Qatar has so many good labour laws that she can follow instead of putting the country in shame.  I like Qatar & will always love to stay here.",

You have to respect all human being and specially be good to the poor. Pay them in time, be good to them, provide them with proper food, do not make them work extra hours than what is promised and treat them with dignity. Please do not be a bad example for the whole community. If Allah s.w.t. has blessed you with wealth than be kind and benevolent to every human being regardless of <b> ethnicity </b>or religion. Please, Please my brothers how can you be so cruel to human beings. Allah s.w.t. created you and created them too so learn to be merciful. If you continue to be cruel to people under your employment you will face Allah s.w.t. and you will not be able to enter Jannah. I am a Muslim and totally condemn anyone who behaves like this with poor people. The Prophet s.a.w. said an Arab is not superior to a non Arab and a non Arab is not superior to an Arab. Brothers fear Allah s.w.t. and be merciful and don't take advantage of these poor people who have families back home to take care of. Being good to another human being is also a Sadaqah e Jariya. If you cannot be good to them let them go free. We are Ummat-e-Nabi s.a.w. we can only be merciful and just. Please be good human beings that they may be impressed with your Akhlaq and come towards the deen. All praise be to Allah s.w.t.",

You can't be scared and hiding and allow yourself to be in this illegal state.. that just won't work.. once you ran away from your sponsors you should go to the police and tell them what's happening.. yes in most cases you will be deported but after you take all your rights with some compensations for the late salaries and the extra hours that will make u live comfortably in your country till u find another job and come back.. I know what happens here those companies always we have household workers and they told us that the office told them lots of wrong informations and made them believe that they are here with no rights and they should do what their bosses say without a question!! You just need to know the rules and regulations before u come to Qatar and u will find that you're very well taken care of.",

The maids have a fridge full of their choice of foods, they have their own room, they can cook in our kitchen, the salary (depending on how long you've been working) ranges from 800 to 1800. I feel so sorry for this lady, I've seen fellow Qataris treat their maids like crap. And this sucks. We, the other Qataris, should be standing up against this.\n\nI had gone on a vacation to France with my family not so long ago. And during breakfast in the morning, our maids had gone off to get their food so they can fuel for a long day in Disney Land, and my father was off doing God-Knows-What. We saw an Arab<b>  woman</b> with her children having breakfast. Her two maids asked if they can get any food, she refused. Several times. My mother gave her \u00a0very....strongly worded...advice. Telling her that she'll end up in hell if she ever does that.\n\nTh<b> e woma</b>n ended up apologising to her maids and she seemed to have gotten very effected with what my mother said because she thanked her many times for confronting her.\u00a0\n\nMoral of story: Always speak up when you see injustice. Even if the people committing the injustice are from your own race/religion.",

I know most people are like, who cares what I think, out of hundreds of people, I am just one person.

The housemaid knows before her departure that her actual salary is not 400...  As evidence,  all the agencies in the GCCs announce  that the salary of Housemaid is around 200... only for legality the employer sign 400.... So the mistake is come from her...  \n\nThen,  the philippine housemaid are well educated.... And this is clear from the housemaid language you posted.. She talk smart and know what to say and what to do to survive...  The POEA in philippine train all the housemaid before they leave thier country...  Partof training that if any things happen they must go to Philippine embassy to protect them.... The housemaid you posted run away from all theses and worked illegally in Qatar...\n\nMy advise to you to waive this video and developone that show both opinion...  Don't be bias toward Qataries...  We don't accept spoiling our reputation. \n\nThank you.",

The Egyptians from Egypt pose as qataris and live as if they are living in their country and do whatever they want. Even near my house an Egyptian  lived like a king and his kids made things for most residents in our floor. They when qatar was blockaded by Egypt in 2017. I was like thank God. I would say Egyptians are the actual trouble not qataris.",

No. But it's how their lifestyle and perhaps there's an influence of their religion as well. But they don't think that we're all humans and we all die.

I have had the honor of treating them when they come to the United States for surgeries.  Even though Qatari physician are totally equipped to do surgeries, their government used to offer to them Qatar or the United States.  I have encountered some nasty people throughout the Middle East, but I cannot condemn people because someone with the same culture mistreated us.  A Qatari family once told me that they hid the maid from next door. She ran to our house, because she was friends with their maid and the daughters. She confided in them that the master in the house used to rape her, and when his boys got <b> old </b>enough they raped her too.  They used to beat her in the middle of the night and the neighbors would hear it.  They would call the police, but<b>  nothing</b> was done.  When she ran away she hid in their house in their daughters bed room.  They were very well connected and they got her passport back from immigration and they sent her back to the Philippines.  She now works in Beirut, and her family takes her with them to London in the summer, while the kids are in camp.  She even went to Paris on the weekends with the mother.  They buy her lots of things, but when they travel to other countries they cannot take her because they have to get her visas which take forever.   She always thanks the Qatari family that saved her.",
