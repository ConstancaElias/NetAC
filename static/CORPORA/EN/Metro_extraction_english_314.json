        "postText": "I was abruptly reminded this week as I walked into my local Poundshop that Valentine\u2019s Day is around the corner.', 'The shelves that used to be filled with lifeless discounted Christmas decorations had suddenly been filled with hearts, cards, feather boas and other items. I\u2019m really not a fan of Valentine\u2019s Day. As my social media timelines get filled with vomit-inducing love quotes like, \u2018I want to be your favourite hello and your hardest goodbye,\u2019 I am starting to understand the philosopher Plato a bit better when he said that \u2018love was like a grave mental disease.\u2019', 'But cynicism and philosophy aside, it really makes me reflect on how far we still have to go when it comes down to love for trans people, and people being allowed to love trans people without shame. When I was coming to terms with who I was well over 10 years ago, I was entirely convinced that I would never find love.', 'This was enforced every single time I saw a trans person represented in the media. We were all depicted as objects of disgust, a Greek tragedy or as psychopathic serial killers.', 'I had a lot of internalised shame and fear before coming out. Once I explained to people that I had little in common with Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs, things got a bit easier. But trans people are still seen as violent and undesirable in today\u2019s society, and we\u2019re still being compared to perverts and paedophiles that groom children, in the same way gay people in the 80s were.', 'Regularly there are scandals in the tabloids about famous straight men who are \u2018caught\u2019 dating a trans woman, tarnishing their reputation and leading to their sexuality being questioned.', 'Accepting trans people as they are and accepting they come in all shapes and sizes (some of which you might quite like) isn\u2019t really such an outrageous idea. You\u2019ve probably secretly fancied a trans person at some point without even knowing they were trans.', 'Even when these stories aren\u2019t in the news I regularly hear people say that they\u2019d never date a trans person. It is usually in the context of, \u2018I\u2019m not transphobic, but\u2026,\u2019 which in reality means that whatever comes out of their mouth next is probably transphobic.', 'Such statements are simply ignorant generalisations fueled by prejudice. Accepting trans people as they are and accepting they come in all shapes and sizes (some of which you might quite like) isn\u2019t really such an outrageous idea. You\u2019ve probably secretly fancied a trans person at some point without even knowing they were trans. Before you go on about how we\u2019re all deceiving you with our impeccable appearance and you could be tricked into dating a trans person, consider this: I\u2019m generally under the impression that most people are decent and wouldn\u2019t be grossed out by a trans person (call me an optimist).', 'So perhaps next time you meet someone, you could lay it straight out there before the first date that you don\u2019t want to date a trans person. It would really save everyone\u2019s time, and would be much more effective than just assuming that everyone feels obliged to share with you all details of their medical history on the first date. But in all seriousness, trans people need acceptance and love more than ever. Any action of inclusion and support by public organisations or institutions is met with ludicrous hostility, and we\u2019re repeatedly targeted by the media with misleading and harmful stories.', 'Any misgiving committed by a trans person is used as evidence to claim we\u2019re all terrible and dangerous people, resulting in negative public perception, increased harassment, discrimination and hate crime.', 'So for this Valentine\u2019s Day, I encourage you to reach out to the people around you that might be struggling and remind them that they are worthy of love. I know from experience that trans people certainly need that reminder; they need to know that they are not less desirable because they are trans.",

If anyone is that sensitive - and i mean anyone -<b>  Ga<b> y</b</b>>, Straight, Trans etc - that a daft day such as this means you NEED to be told you are loved, then you need to take a long hard look at yourself deep down, to deal with the real root of the problem. Self love is way more important than love of others. You cannot love others or accept love from others if you cannot love yourself first. I will be at work on V Day, then off to a class, then home. It will be just like any other day. I am not single.",

It isn't something that everyone just has an automatic right to expect and certainly can't be judged by someone just saying it for the sake of it.",
