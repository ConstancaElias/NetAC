            "commentText": "I dont think that anger against Jews is stemming from a sort of emotional response to avoid responsibility. I think it stems from the understanding that Ashkenazi Jews are higher IQ, segregate themselves so never assimilate, aggressively pursue positions of wealth, power and influence over society, and continually push pro-immigration, pro-LGBT, pro-feminism, anti-white agendas. Not all Jews are involved, in fact those that remain religious and are nationalists are generally not involved in this. It is by-and-large the racial Jews who have denounced their own religion and who have become radicial liberals as a result. Strangely they retain their strong in-group mentality and can be very hostile/unpleasant people to be around.",

But some facts merit mention:\r\n\r\n* In the US, Steven Miller has been actively promoting the racialization of Central American asylum seekers, which is a head scratcher given  all  that's outlined in this article.  AIPAC has been  mute.  \r\n\r\n* David Frum just published an article in the Atlantic magazine arguing for the freezing of all US immigration.  Sounds like he's trying to confuse the public with the argument that will be used against the Palestinians' right of return. 'A country has the right to say no to immigration.'\r\n\r\n* US Neocons forced the Iraqi invasion/destruction, and in the process destabilizing the Middle Esast. Millions were displaced and millions have entered the Europe, while its economies have yet to recover from the 2008 US-driven economic recession\r\n\r\n* Netanyahu, US casino owner Sheldon Adelson et al engineered  Jerusalem's and most recently the Golan Heights land grab.    Concurrently, some media headlines have been arguing there has been no reaction to the announcement to legitimize it .  Really? \r\n\r\n* The Likud Party issued a manifesto announcing the unilateral appropriation of the occupied territories.  \r\n\r\n* Bob Rubin & friends eliminated the Glass-Steagall Act, which allowed 'Sandy Weill' to create a financial supermarket meant to stimulate market competitiveness.   The ensuing looting caused the 2008 Great Recession & destruction of  American families.",

It does not give one hope for the future of our species.\n\nThe Jews of the world do NOT represent Israel. Israel does NOT represent the Jews of the world. Most Jews are not Zionists.  I have a great unlove for Israel and its hate filled Zionist leaders, but that does not translate into a hate on for Jews, any more than my intense dislike of neo Nazis causes me to hate all white people.\n\nEurope also has the problems created by this flood of Jew hating Muslims into Europe.  It seems to be contagious and the European left is buying into the hate that is being imported into the country, from the middle east.\n\nDo all Muslims hate Jews? Of course not, but antisemitism is very <b> common </b>among people from that area and the flood of refugees and the rise of antisemitism in Europe, are happening at the same time. <b>  Race</b> hate is just as ugly and unacceptable from the left as it is from the right.",

Many of us also have Semitic bloodlines and recognize infant circumcision as a <b> racist </b>and sexist Semitic hate crime against non Semitic goyum and gentiles. We tell our intact European, Asian, and<b>  African</b> brothers to protect themselves from the liberal American Zionists, and conservative American evil angelical judeochristians. It's not wise to fool Mother Nature. America and Israel stand alone in their faith in infant genital mutilation. Jewish American lawyers just got the anti FGM law overthrown in the USA because little girl circumcision makes just as much nonsense as baby boy circumcision. It's very difficult to reason with superstitious religious extremists with cognitive dissonance. Hell hast no fury compared to the scorn of a wounded animal..",

First off, most hate crimes against jews and blacks are false flags, done by the jews and blacks themselves. It's<b>  old</b> and outplayed. You can't be trusted with the news whatsoever. If jews aren't spraying swastikas on their own synagogues, destroying their own jewish cemetery, jews are bomb threatening their own synagogues. Jews have been kicked out of over a hundred nations for a reason! These are facts you stupid leftist followers look past. Mainstream media is so bias and fake.",

The Jews have bamboozled the entire world with their lies of being from Shem. There is no such thing as antisemitism when it pertains to the Jews. They are NOT , I repeat they are NOT from Shem according to the bible. Jews are from Japhett and they know it too. They have stolen the identity of the Hebrew-Israelites. The Israelites are from Shem not the Jews!! .Wherever you see the word Jew in the bible you can know immediately that it is simply an insertion. It has no business being there. Where you see Jew it use to be Israelite or Yahudah. None of the 12 tribes have the name Jew. Nor were there any white Hebrew-Israelites either. The Son of the heavenly Father walked this earth as a Israelite...not a Jew!",

Trying to draw associations between Trump and neo-nazis or kkk extremist haters is absurd.  I'm sure there are bigots who are Trump supporters, but I'm also certain there are bigots who voted for Obama.  What worries me though, is how many people have forgotten the art of critical thinking, and are unable to see the bias that is heavily present in their media sources, on both sides.  Then they allow their chosen media outlet, to work them up into a frenzy of hate for the \"other\", whoever the \"other\" happens to be.   They are manipulating your thoughts, the way you feel, your emotions, and then organizing you into different groups in order to better manage everybody.  Playing this one against that one, shifting the social balance of things so that it serves their interests, not yours.  People should be protesting their dishonest and corrupt media sources which are promoting this climate of fear and hatred.",

Just because there is no other monotheist<b> ic nati</b>on to compare them to, doesn't mean that they are necessarily only a religion O<b> R a nat</b>ion.  \nAs far as the other part of your statement, I find in it hypocrisy.  In the same sentence you accuse Jews of being supremacist and then immediately say that you think you are better than all Jews to the point that they should be vanished.

            "commentText": "Research the Greater Israel Project. It is criminally insane, and it represents the ultimate agenda behind the zionist movement. It is <b> nothing </b>short of total genocide. This why Israel and the U.S. have been engaged in a 7 year long genocidal proxy war against Syria.\n\nIsrael and its allies have been trying to destroy Syria completely, and here is motive behind this war criminality. CNN is one of my sources for this, although I doubt that it was the intent on the part of CNN to reveal the truth behind the war on Syria.\n\ncnn.com/2015/11/08/opinions/oren-israel-golan-heights/ \"While hosting Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Obama could acknowledge the fact that the Golan can no longer be exchanged for peace with Syria [because Syria no longer exists].\"\n\nThis is why Israel and its Axis Alliance does not want to let go of Syria. Wiping out Syria and Iran is essential for the Greater Israel map to be realized.\n\nWhat the super cynical neocon zio-Nazis do not realize is this:\n\nIT IS ALL ABOUT THE MEANS... ONLY THE MEANS CAN JUSTIFY THE END.\n\nA good outcome requires good means. When people resort to evil means, you will get blowback and pushback. This is what has become of the Neoconservative Agenda. The militant, radical zionist neocons have resorted to the most violent, destructive and deceitful means to accomplish the ends they had in mind. Before, during and after 9/11.\n\nAll that the war criminal neocons have to show for it is mass scale death and destruction, and people turning against ordinary rank and file Jews, because they can't do anything about what the people at the top are doing.\n\nEverybody should listen to the 1961 Benjamin H. Freedman Speech for an education. Then read his 1974 speech.\n\nListen to All Wars Are Bankers' Wars, and listen to How Big Oil Conquered The World.\n\nThe people at CNN, if they want to do some good, should have an intelligent round panel discussion on this issue. If you are capable of doing that... So far, all you've been talking about are some of the symptoms of a much larger problem.\n\nDo you want to leave this world a better place for your children and grandchildren, or not?\n\nI looked over to my right, and I see the latest warmongering lies coming from CNN. \"Will President Trump hold Russia accountable over Ukraine?\"\n\nExcuse me, but didn't the trouble in Ukraine begin after the U.S./Neocon coup d'etat in Kiev in 2014?.. Yes it did.\n\nAnyone in the media or press who enables the war criminals in Washington are also war criminals. This is what you have done with your lies and distortions. You are no different than Joseph Goebbels. \n\nCNN, and the rest of the corporate media, represent the propaganda arm for the War Lobby. They, YOU, are war criminals. Without their enablers in the media, the war criminals in Washington could not have gotten away with it for so long.\n\nIf Trump goes along with your nihilistic agenda, the he is a war criminal, too, and if he gets us into a nuclear war over Syria, Ukraine, or Iran or North Korea. Then Trump will be recorded in history as the biggest genocidal monster ever in human history.\n\nI wish that Trump was colluding with Russia, because only then would peace have a chance. Wasn't it President Obama who said that you don't negotiate with your friends, but your enemies?\nReal or perceived.\n\nJust how dedicated to evil and lies are you so called journalists?.. Are you all-in, or do you have some wiggle room?",

Sara, are you saying in other words, that you are a religious narcissist working for a media house that is owned by religious narcissists?

In my opinion when the left especially the left wing media covers up political violence like that of antifa and all the people who attacked trump supporters during the election that CNN failed to even acknowledge it just makes things worse because then the other side now has a justification in there own head that allows for violence. And now here we are  so I hope those people are happy that they broke a statue but was it worth all this ? Is this what liberal means to attack others culture ? And CNN has fanned the flames for the corporate overlords and now they want to act innocent like what they have been saying things like white men are the problem and someone should do something has had no effect ? Or calling everyone a <b> nazi </b>was a good idea ? Take some responsibility CNN you know you make money on<b>  race</b> baiting and political violence yet you act innocent ? That being said political violence is stupid and wrong and I don't support any of it !",

Such attacks mostly come from Muslims and now also from these Nazis. But the number of Nazis is still small, B'H. The problem is there is a major threat too. And that threat comes from the mainstream left and their support of these fictional people they call \"palestinians\" that come from the non-existing land of \"palestine\", a land they claim is in Israel. A \"<b> nation\"</b> they claim, Israel oppresses and occupies.\n\nWe who still know actual history know that<b>  nothing</b> could be further from the truth. The name \"Palestine\" was invented by the Romans who invented it and called Israel \"Syria Palestinia\" during the Roman occupation of Israel to disassociate Jews from their own lands. That name was used again by the British occupation of Israel lasting from the end of WW1 till 1948, well after WW2. An occupation that was and is against international law, that in 1920 ordered the British to give what then was called \"Palestine\", back to its rightful owners, the Jewish people. \n\n85 % of that land is still occupied by the British empire's proxies, the Hashemite Kingdom that they today call Jordan which actually is Gad, Reuben and Manasseh, three Israeli tribes. As well as Judea and Samaria, the very heartland of Israel which the occupation calls the \"West Bank\".\n\nClaims that Israel occupies the fictitiou<b> s natio</b>n of \"Palestine\" by the way are raised by CNN and other Fake Media outlets on a daily basis. Making this report hypocritical at best.",

Regrettably I used to be religious though, believing in things I could not prove scientifically. Thing is, today I can easily provide indisputable scientific evidence for the fact that we have One Creator. Additionally I can deliver solid evidence that that Creator is the G-d of Israel, that part of the evidence is solid, but not yet indisputable although all religions, aside from Judaism at the very least to some extend contradict with the evidence, the indisputable part.",

Any sane individual looking at this objectively simply cannot explain this away as compassionate and benevolent actions on the part of the left/dems.

This is more than just a little disconcerting. I am very much shocked that more people aren't protesting the left/dems position. The fact that they won the house is frightening.

Did you believe there was corruption in the criminal justice system? Before Trump did you think \"the establishment\" could take down whoever they wanted if they \"REALLY\" wanted to? \n\nWhat has changed? Has the establishment changed? Has your opinion on the establishment  changed? Do you feel democrats cant be part of \"the establishment\"? If so, why?\n\nIs it usually harder or easier to be on the side of justice, generally OR  historically speaking?\n\nIs it any harder or easier to support trump or oppose  him? If so, why?\n\nIs there a general unpopularity of trump by your peers? What drives that unpopularity? Social media? Opinions on Television? Opinions in Universities, opinions from pop culture personalities?\n\nIf so, Can the television and pop culture \"establishment\" be trusted? Do you believe schools should teach ideology? Do you believe  one should adapt the views and culture of college campuses because they are institutions of higher learning so ideoligies taught in such institutions are morally righteous, especially when attached to a cause? Have you always believed this about schools?\n\nHas something changed about  Pop culture? Has the teachings of universities changed? What is the function of media? What is the function of education? \n\nDoes disagreeing with someone cross the line into hatred for that person with yourself or with your peers? Why?\n\nIf you lived in a country where the leader was a part of an outwardly-admitted violent extremist organization would it be rational for the population to want to arm itself for protection against that leader and the military forces he or she could potentially control?\n\nHave you heard a media outlet  or political figure accuse or pose a question asking if President Trump is a white supremacist?\n\nHow does this make you feel?\n\nWhere does your ideology lie? Do you know where you stand on the political spectrum? Do you believe in American principles?  Do you know what your morals and ideology are? Can you name some of them? If someone is unsure of their morals and ideology are they more likely to be misled or manipulated?",

They completely turned a <b> blind </b>eye that his base and the people attracted to him were white nationalist and racists. Exactly those groups that follow<b>  Nazi</b> Germany's racial ideology and antisemitism.  To this day, especially after reports like this, I just can't wrap my head around this.\n\nI spoke with an older Jewish scholar earlier this year, she was approaching 90 and well traveled... I talked with her about this issue and she completely agreed with me, not only that... she is shaking her head about Jewish Trump supporters. She believes a failed educational system is to blame, that teaches only cursory about WW2 and the rise o<b> f Naz</b>i'ism in Germany is being reduced to \"We are the best, we won WW2\"... \n\nDo I feel bad for the Jewish people? I feel bad for those that did not support Trump and his dog-whistling and those are the ones being attacked and have to suffer.",

My family has \"1951 Geneva Convention <b> Refugee\"</b> status (fleeing from Stalin and his genocide of the Ukrainian people)and I was born under that status in Germany as well. I would like you to see the irony here. \"Good for Israel and business\"... That's what the Germans thought \"He's good for Germany and was good for the economy\" Not seeing what comes with the package. I know... because I grew up in Germany and learned their history in detail in school.\n\nLooking at a single issue, instead of the big picture has<b>  nothing</b> to do with being an individualist, it has to do with the ability to see the larger issue at hand.\n\nMy point is that the collective \"group an<b> d ethni</b>c interest\" of the Jewish people has been \"Never Again!\", meaning that what has happened to them in Nazi-Germany, they will never let that happen again. A good portion of the Jewish people (esp. in New York) seem to have forgotten that \"group a<b> nd ethn</b>ic interest\"  and voted for someone that opened up the acceptance of hate speech and violence against their own people.\n\nIf you can not see that, or understand, then I really can not help you.",

And you ask yourself why far-right got so powerful from nowhere since they have always been around. Pretty logical... Fossil oil industry who are fighting for their survival because of specially EU but also China and USA decision to move away from fossil oil consumption. And who are they? USA, Saudi Arabia, Russia,...\nDo you see now? This is no conspiracy theory. Do you think the fossil oil industry would give up without a fight?

The are comprised of the men and women who are male-supremacists, then by the smaller group of supremacists - the \"correct religion\" klans, then the next smaller group, \"white supremacists\" and littered across those 3 versions are the wealthy OR poor people who believe finances determine rights and power.\n\nWhen we think of a newborn baby, the first question is not about money or religion or skin color, is it?  No, it's \"boy or girl?\"  The \"gateway\" form of supremacy is male-supremacy.  Studies show that babies dressed in blue or pink are treated differently from each other with more attention, touch and responsiveness given to babies perceived to be male.\n\nWhat's my point?  This hate environment in America is all about our founding flaw - supremacy.  The founders also wrote the cure - \"liberty and justice for ALL.\"   We who value Equality - a necessary value for any democracy, also need to unite towards making that reality.\n\nThe most attacked group in America is women.  The most effective way to eliminate all of the forms of supremacy is to ensure Equal rights for women first.  That group targeted by sexists (male-supremacists) crosses all other types of supremacists and the numbers are so large and the problem is so \"accepted as normal\" that making women the focus of advancing equality is the most efficient way for America to reach the \"tipping point.\"\n\nWe can no longer compete as special interest groups based on <b> race,</b> religion or money... we must all unite to pass the Equal Rights Amendment and then more than half of the  American population will make that shift.  ERA.org\n\nIt's all very \"First they came...\" and the response must be \"United We Stand.\"  You know, even the sexists can get behind \"Ladies first.\"  :)",

Anger is the issue here, and always has been. Anger has been manipulated, within multiple cultures, into a weaponized form  most commonly known as hate. Can we take a step back for a moment and pause to consider who is manipulating our anger into hate? Hate produces a net gain, not positive gain. It has no value beyond the destruction it causes. Whether you are Jewish or of any other cultural descent all of our anger has been manipulated, through one form or another. That is one of many things we all have in <b> common.</b> Happiness and harmony to you all, let's work together and realize we are a species best united.",

We can speculate that it's at the point that smart phones were introduced & social media took off making this all easily viewable & accessible but who knows, what we do know is that anti sentiment &<b>  racism</b> has never been a thing of the past.\n\nWe always blame one side or the other for current situations instead of working together towards a peaceful medium, respect, compassion & love for one another because at the end of the day WE ARE ALL AMERICANS & WANT THE BEST FOR OUR COUNTRY, CHILDREN & OURSELVES. Teach our kids not hate but equality we are all the same, judge not on skin color<b> , rac</b>e or religion but on ones character & at times when we don't agree or can come to a happy medium try understanding the other persons view, peacefully & respectfully disagree.",

Farage, pronounced as garbage, totally believes in right wing xenophobic action who then disavows certain actions and then later offers platitudes before the <b> racism </b>begins again.\nHe smokes his pint of beer whilst drinking his cigarette to show he is one of the people. He is an ex-banker (I was going to put the letter 'w'    instead of the 'b' in banker) who is quite well off. Now divorced.\n\nWhat Trump said is linked to garbage.\n\nAll he cares about is himself and his self aggrandizement. \n\nIsn't this is why Trump is on Twitter to make sure his name is always in the news at the cost of reporting news?\n\nFarage has caused a right wing reaction in Britain, and he is giving his vociferous opinions to Trump.\n\u00a0,",

They believe in the socialistic government policies implemented in <b> Nazi </b>Germany (which itself was a left-wing national socialist [where the meaning of the word <b> \"Nazi</b>\" comes from] government). Social welfare programs, centralized economic planning, and centralized banking were embraced by the Nazis and utilized by them, and these new people.\nAlso note, Trump himself has Jewish relatives (such as his son-in-law). The idea that somehow these white supremacists were waiting for Trump to lead them is retarted. He himself has very Philo-Semitic views and actions (like moving America's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem).",

Why are Republicans pandering to non-whites when they will NEVER adopt Conservatism in large enough numbers? One base<b> d blac</b>k guy in a MAGA hat and you guys can't wait to sing his praises.

These people don't accept fact, hence you can't debate them. These people have no shame, so there's no point in shaming them. Physical violence sometimes is the only option to deal with them. It's like a chemotherapy for cancer. And I don't care if people say that I am just like them, heck, I KNOW I am not like them. I'm doing society a favor by beating the crap out of these little stinkers. If violence changes the mind of only one of them, that's a win for society.",

Trump has a history of insulting the Jewish population throughout his life. Now, Trump only respects the dictators and those who promote attacks against the Jewish. This is a cancer eating away at the US's moral and ethical heart and Trump's support of these hate groups spread beyond the Jewish population. This year alone there have been 300+ mass shooting with 250+ deaths and this relates directly to Trump's and the GOP's  attempts to split the<b>  nation</b> and their destruction of the US's moral and ethics. Th<b> e natio</b>n may not survive Trump and his march towards a dictatorship if he remains in office his entire term. Trump's cancer has spread across the world because the stabilizing influence of the USA has been destroyed.  The longer the GOP allows Trump to continue this, the US ad the world will remain in chaos.  I fear for my children and grandchildren. The US is only steps away from becoming a dictatorship thankfully the election may have prevented this.",

I think their should be more rigorous training to become a cop.

In conclusion, Nazis are Socialists too. But go ahead and fight eachother, preferably kill eachother, good riddance.",

If I marry someone Jewish, I will convert for them but that's not the point. \nThere are different types of Zionism. Lehi Zionism. Which is stupid. Labour Zionism and I think it's called Revisionist Zionism like Netanyahu.  There may be others.  And, that whole money thing, that in itself is anti-Semitic. That is the Hitlerite theory of 'International Jewry' which is disgustingly evil and false.",

Can you imagine how extremely fucked we will be if he does? People like this is making us face inminent extinction.\n\nAnd also there's a thing called empathy that makes you care about people when they are suffering, and Brazilians will undoubtedly suffer a lot under their new government, so I care about that, even if I will not be directly affected by it.

Hell he moved the US embassy, which the past 4 or.more president told Israel they would do then didnt.......\n\nThis whole narrative is shocking. If hes <b> racist </b>or<b>  dumb</b> or incomponent i can at least have a discussoon where people make their case with things hes said or done.........this whole antisemetism is Trumps fault narrative blows me away. Not only is there no evidence of it, he has gone out of his way to do things FOR the Jewish community. Theres a point you guys all need to realize you are no longer just ill informed...........you are lying. \n\nIm not saying on purpose. I think you all have been repeating things said on the news without looking into the truth and now wheb its something totally baseless, you guys never realized. So your reoeating something wit<b> h zer</b>o evidence. And there is a point you need to realize that and ask yourself if lying is helping.\n\nDont think you are lying?? Give me evidence of Trump being antisemetic...................",

I actually don't blame blacks nearly as much as I blame Hollywood and news organizations like CNN that create a false narrative about <b> racism </b>against blacks. That's not to say there isn't any, of course there is, but take for example the fact that whites are killed by police at a 2-1 or 3-1 ratio every year, yet CNN only ever shows stories of blacks being killed by cops. Why, I'll tell you why, to get blacks all in a fury which gets CNN more stories and the cycle continues and blacks get more racists towards whites. Look up the numbers btw if you don't believe more white men than blacks are killed every year.",

Jesus is the cause of the divide it is those that believe in his ways and have some of his spirit in them or in some cases a lot. It is a spiritual war. If you look at Pope Francis he plays on the team of Satan, no different than Obama and most of the liberal democrats. The opposite force believes in God to a point and believes in saving the country. The enemy wants to destroy it. Than you have the devil and his agents spreading, lies, false doctrines, false christs and setting up the infrastructure to slave and brand humanity like cattle.\n\n(Isaiah 5:20-25) \"Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!  Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight! Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink: Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him! Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.  Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.\"\n\n(Matthew 12:25-30) \"And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand? And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges. But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.  Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house. He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.\"\n\n(Luke 12:51) \"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth?

They need us more than we need them.\nJust because Obama bowed & scraped all over the world . He was weak on jobs weak on trade he weakened the military- he was just a failure.\nWhy do you think it's okay for the US to be ripped off ?!\n    As far as Russia goes .... you know that every US president in the last 70 years has met with the Russian president right ?\nThat's what heads of state do.\nTrump has been very tough on Russia with sanctions,  with closing consulates and expelling diplomats.\n  It was Obama who said on a hot mic to the Russian PM \n\"I'll have more flexibility after the election\"\n  It was Clinton who took $500,000 for a speech in Moscow.\n It was Obama and Clinton who sold 20% of our f**** URANIUM to Russia !\n   And it was Obama Clinton and then weaponized intelligence agencies who purchased a FAKE Russian Intel dossier to frame the elected president.\n    The fake Russian collusion thing is a hoax !    it was to protect Clinton and her emails and to frame the duly elected president.\n\" if this bastard wins we're all going to hang from nooses\" - HRC",

                    "commentText": "@Janet Masiello \nCNN is your master. How? Convince me by proving it with some points.\nI'll show you how it is done: \nOn a Monday night (Nov 5), Fox News hosts Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro made an appearance onstage with President Donald Trump at a rally in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. Trump and Hannity were practically kissing on camera. There is no other perfect moment to demonstrate how FOX NEWS is NOT NOT NOT unbiased.  Even Fox's own journalists were pissed off. They knew that Hannity and company further ruined the network's reputations.\r\n\r\nTrump and Hannity and their ilk are controlling the majority of Fox News.\r\n\r\nThe Free Press reports on what the government does and the effects of the government's actions. Propaganda State Press reports on what the government WANTS you to hear. The State Press echoes the government's message...do you see the difference? Do you see the danger?\r\n\r\nFox News is listed as ENTERTAINMENT. It has become (acknowledged by Hannity) Trump's favorite news source. Media outlets should not declare themselves as the POTUS or the Government's favorite news source nor should they promote a certain news outlet such as FOX.\r\n\r\nFox News (opinion shows) have become the official propaganda center. Currently, we have the POTUS tweeting to plug Fox shows he likes. Where Trump's tweets parroted soundbites from Fox News.\r\nWhere Trump dines with his newbie best friend, Sean Hannity. Where the POTUS calls into his favorite Fox News shows. Where he even recruits appoints Fox News employees to his cabinet. Where Fox News dismisses and attacks the FBI and Mueller and yet celebrates Russia.\r\n\r\nLet's add this important tidbit:\r\nTrump appointed his SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh under the advisement of Sean Hannity when he met Trump at his NJ Bedminister home. Since when is Sean a official Whitehouse member? Sean Hannity shared a lawyer (Cohen) with Trump that he deliberately hid from his viewers. \r\n\r\n*John Trump hired from FOX to work in his Administration. John Bolton (most recent position was Former Fox News contributor) took his position as national security adviser on March 22, replacing H.R. McMaster. \r\n\r\n*Heather Nauert began her career with Fox News in 1998, where she worked until 2005 before leaving and hopping around other news organizations. She returned to the network in 2007. \r\n\r\n*Mercedes Schlapp began contributing to Fox News after her work as director of specialty media during the Bush administration.  \r\n\r\n*Tony Sayegh has been both a regular contributor and guest of multiple shows airing on Fox News. Although he now represents the Treasury Department under the Trump administration, he still appears on the network.\r\n\r\n*KT McFarland. During her time with Fox News, McFarland wrote a weekly column for the network's website and appeared on-air as a national security commentator.\r\n\r\n* Scott Brown Former Fox News contributor. Brown joined Fox News in 2013.\r\n\r\n* Richard Grenell worked at Fox since 2009.\r\n\r\n* John McEntee was Mr. Trump's personal aide and body man during the campaign and for a year in the White House. McEntee, 28, started his job as a production assistant for Fox News in 2015, focusing on the network's social media presence.\r\n\r\n* Georgette Mosbacher was a Fox News contributor.\r\n\r\n* Scaramucci's time in the White House was very brief -- he served at the White House communications director for just 10 days before Mr. Trump fired him. Scaramucci appeared on Fox Business Network as a contributor and hosted a show called \"Wall Street Week.\"  \r\n\r\n*Bill Shine....need I say any more?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich other POTUS recruited their staff from ONE specific media company? This is a complete incestuous relationship between Fox and Trump.",

Yes the Christian people come out of Hebrew bloodline and the promise land of Israel. Granted we are adopted in, heck I am find with that, Jesus paid the price for me and everyone else on team Jesus. In the end when Jesus returns all those who served the antichrist will be sent to the lake of fire. Until then those of Satan will try to kill all of us. The left loves Islam. Your post you are calling for Jihad against the Muslim religion. The Muslims hate the half brother Issac and they want to steal the promise. The promise is Jesus and they can't steal him only convert and leave their false religion.",

The Jews need to take off the spiritual blinders and know Jesus  the Jewish messiah. The church needs to clean up her act and get to know Jesus when Jesus returns those who have no oil will miss the rapture. I will let Jesus explain what has happened to America and the world.\n\n(Matthew 13:24-30) \"The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth <b> fruit,</b> then appeared the tares also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.\"\n\nI will let Jesus explain his parable\n\n(Matthew 13:37-43) \"He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.\"\n\nWhat is going on? Maybe CNN should do a video on Mark 13, oh no, forget that, they would screw it up.\n\n(Mark 13:8-13) \"For<b>  nation</b> shall rise agains<b> t natio</b>n, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.  But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them. And the gospel must first be published among all nations. But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost. Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death. And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.\"\n\n(Matthew 24:9-12) \"Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.  And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.\"\n\n(Revelation 13:7-10) \"And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.\"\n\n(Revelation 14:12) \"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\"\n\n(Revelation 2:2) \"I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:\"\n\n(Revelation 3:10-13) \"Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.  Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown. Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.\"",

I'll try to keep it simple even though most students spend FOUR years studying this. Get ready. \r\n\r\n'Nazi' is the short name. The full name for the 'Nazi' party was the \"National Socialist German Workers' Party\" \r\n\r\nThat is where part of your confusion begins: you have made the world and its realities too simple. It is neither <b> black </b>nor white. Every camp has a bit of something else in the mix. \r\n\r\n1) Every successful capitalist country has forms of socialism. Germany is the top (FIRST) ranking capitalist country in the world - in front of the USA and China.  By international standards, the German welfare system is comprehensive and generous. Around 918 billion euros was committed to public social spending in 2016, equating to a share of 29 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Health insurance cover is a legal requirement in Germany. Medical care is guaranteed by a broad spectrum of hospitals, practices, and rehabilitation clinics. It provides these benefits via a complex network of national agencies and a large number of independent regional and local entities. AND YET, Germany is the strongest capitalistic countries in the world. HOW? It is by far possess better investments and support of banking and education. Banking and education are the countries top priorities. No, I am not referring to international banking but rather it is banks that invest in local businesses and industries. \r\n\r\n2) There three types of Humanism:\r\n*Liberal Humanism (the freedom which resides in each individual)\r\n*Evolutionary Humanism (This group is humans might degenerate into subhumans or evolve into superhumans)\r\n*Socialist Humanism  (this is the group that believes in equality, equity and the collective)\r\n\r\nGuess which one Fascism favor. Guess which group shares the combined ideals of Socialists and the<b>  Common</b> Good?  \"We the People\" steams from the philosophy of th<b> e Commo</b>n Good. In Plato's work, The Republic,  Socrates contends that the greatest social good is the \"cohesion and unity\" that \"result[s] from t<b> he comm</b>on feelings of pleasure and pain which you get when all members of a society are glad or sorry for the same successes and failures.\" \r\n\r\n3)There are many authoritarian countries and corrupt countries that contain the word Democratic in their official name but does not mean they actually are democratic or practice democracy as we know it.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo is an example. Are you going to tell me that North Korea is a democratic country? Try it and then look up the official name - Democratic People's Republic of Korea!  Be careful on who calls themselves a Democrat (the opportunistic Trump) until the circumstances change.\r\n\r\n4) As for the Nazis in Germany,  you need to understand the rising appeal of Communism that Hitler feared and hated. The Nazis, a far-right party (READ FASCIST) contained 'socialist' in the name was a rebranding gambit to draw workers away from communism and into popul<b> ist national</b>ism. Hitler's party positioned as a left-wing organisation based on his rhetoric, rather than his actions, espoused in the 1920s and 1930s to disenfranchised workers frustrated with what they perceived as a two-tier society. The name was a means to an end: POWER. The later 1930's and into the 40's proved how the Nazis controlled power: FASCISM! Fascism is the polar opposite of the left.\r\n\r\nA fascist government is supreme, and all institutions must conform to the willing of the ruling authority.\r There is no equality since there is only a hierarchy (superhuman and subhuman). There is no freedom as one's thoughts must bend to support the will of the government. \r\n\r\n5) Read the list of characteristics of a fascism governement. You will notice that out of 15, number 11 is the one that all Trump supporters fixate on while completely ignored the other 14.\r\n1.Fascism ex<b> alts na</b>tio<b> n and</b> race over the individual\r\n2.Centralized, authoritarian, and often dictatorial government\r\n3.Strong and charismatic leader\r\n4.Strict governmental control over opposition, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly\r\n5.Severe social regulations\r\n6.Crucial role of heroes\r\n7.Strong attachment to moral, nationalistic values\r\n8.Glory of the state over the individual\r\n9.The individual is required to put the interest of the state before his personal goals/needs\r\n10.Unique economy\r\n11.Strong governmental involvement in economy an production\r\n12.The State has strong influence over investment and industries\r\n13.In order to receive the support of the government, businesses need to promise that their main interest is the enhancement of the country\r\n14.Opposed to free market economy\r\n15.In some instances, international trade is opposed (because of the primacy of the nationalist feeling)",

                    "commentText": "@Nikolai Collushnikov \n5)I can't speak about Hitler from experience, but I can speak about Franco.  My early childhood was spent in Spain under the dictatorship of Franco. You should be able to notice that what my family experienced tick most of the character traits list above. \r\n\r\nAs long as the economy is strong, unemployment low and foreign affairs not including all-out war, President Trump will look good.\"\r\n\r\nYes, I see numerous similarities.\r\n Currently, Trump is what I call Franco-lite. He is a shade of a fascist. If we allow him to continue, his fascist colors will get more and more prominent. \r\n\r\nFranco fought against his own fellow Spaniards in a bloody civil war. Once he won power, he imprisoned journalists and shut down newspapers he didn't like and replaced them with propaganda ones. \r\nEvery dictator lashes out against the media. It's the first step they take. Destroy Truth and everything else is easy.\r\n\r\nFranco censored anyone who was perceived to be an opponent. \r\n\r\nFranco banned books and scrutinized and destroyed art. \r\nNational Endowment of the Arts and Humanities is gone. Of course, Trump attacks the 'liberal' elites. Threatening to defund California because the Hollywood celebrities hate him. Yes, I know that Trump is threatening to defund the state because he says its due to mismanagement of the forests but seriously he has no clue that the issue of deforestation and fire management is under the federal gov't or does he understand the science behind climate change....he simply hates Hollywood.  \"I love the uneducated\" - Trump\r\n.  'Education is dangerous \u2013 every educated person is a future enemy.'  Hermann Goering (yes, Georing worked for Hitler but this is a great quote spoken by a fascist). \r\n\r\n\r\nFranco empowered one religion - Catholic Church - over all others (today's Evangelicals).  Trump fakes his faith. Two Corinthians walk into a bar.....\r\n\r\nFranco curtained women's rights such as being barred from employment in the justice field, no divorces, strictly limiting female employment (I remember an unmarried maid of the family had committed suicide because she found out she was pregnant out of marriage).\r\nWe all know the numerous examples of his <b> misogyny </b>(his attacks on Ford is just one tiny example) and defunding Planned Parenthood and threatening to make abortion a criminal act. \r\n\r\n Franco was an isolationist and therefore anti-globalist. Spain became an inward country and therefore became economical poor. Ironically, Ivanka wins 13 trademarks in China, Trump continues to make money on his international hotels and most of his products are made in China AND YET one of his talking points is how evil globalism is. Tariffs are costing Americans money and JOBS. Timber from Canada is more costly therefore housing costs are going up. Companies have moved or are warning Trump they are going to move outside of the US. Ford starts MASSIVE layoffs after losing over 1 Billion dollars due to layoffs.  Our allies think we are a joke and can no longer be relied upon. France wants to create a European army because Trump wants to destroy NATO. China has a tentacle in every continent and harvesting those resources while the US has retreated backward. An isolated US is a weak US. \r\n\r\nFamily corruption was high in Spain (Again, Ivanka was awarded 13 trademarks from China). Trump never separated himself from his businesses. He has foreign dignitaries stay at his DC hotel. He has his own family members employed in gov't. He has his son in secret meetings with the Russians.  Kushner was pissed off at Qatar becuse they refused to lend his family money so during Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, they hash a plan to punish Qatar. They created a boycott/embargo. Qatar felt the heat and months later SURPRISE Qatar lends the money to the Kunshers. \r\n\r\n Military strength and parades were a priority. Franco always wore his military uniform. At least Franco had military experience and didn't run from a military fight whereas Trump received five deferments. Trump is so desperate to have his own parade and he pretends to care about vets....but his hair! It's raining...\r\n\r\nForced patriotism was the norm in Spain.  Trump hates the rain but damns anyone who takes the knee. He wants the NFL to fire any player who 'disrespects the flag' . \r\nTrump wants people fired if they don't sing the anthem or stand up for the flag. \r\n\r\nFranco spread lies and rumors in order to control his narrative. \r\nTruth isn't truth. Don't believe every you hear. We are up to over 6000 lies since January of 2017. \r\nHere is another poignant quote from another fascist: 'If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.'\r\nJoseph Goebbels\r\n\r\n\r\nDissenters were killed in mass or quietly disappeared. ..............ummmmm.....Trump hasn't done this but he sure isn't going to punish his dictator friends (Putin and Saudis) who do kill journalists.",

The modern left is attempting to switch the definition of anything good is socialist anything bad is fascism, but that doesn't work.  \n\nFascism is an economic system of government central planning and high regulations in which any businesses has little say so in it's own operation. The fact is that the German National Socialist Labor Party came to power promising guaranteed several weeks vacation, guaranteed pensions, government funded pension homes, guaranteed employment, welfare for the poor, home for the <b> disabled,</b>  high government regulation of banks and industry protecting the little guy, the government promotion of industry producing products to appeal the the lower and the middle classes.  Consider the<b>  Nazi</b> formation of the VolksWagen company, the people's car.  You can't get more proletarian then that.  In other words, fascism is not lazy-fare capitalism, the real opposite to socialism.\n\nAnd the Germans and everybody else had real reason to fear Communism.  The Bolsheviks had just murdered tens of millions of Russians and Ukrainians and had been staging revolutionary movements in Europe.  There is no reason to expect that any newly empowered Communists to not murder them too. \n\nIf you have experience with Franco's Spain than you should already know what I say about identity politics is frightfully true.  Oh by the way, just which identity group was highly represented in the Soviet Bolsheviks?",

It works like this: \"Oh look, individual liberties is one of the 15 points of socialism so go vote for cortez ocasio.\"   Socialism is still the transfer of wealth through government force.  No other option is conceivable.  Not everyone is happy with giving their money away, so you need government force.   Therefore socialism is always authoritarian and anti-liberty.  \nYou're partially right about southern Europe. It has less to do with distrusting central government and more to do with distrust being built into the culture.  In a culture of trust and honesty, people will trust the government because they know people like them are running government. Think the Netherlands.  People in Greece or Italy don't trust the government because they know the government is run by Greeks and Italians.  That's what happened to Venezuela.  Socialism was doomed in Venezuela because socialism was run by Venezuelans.\nCentral Europe still has problems because their Cultures were hollowed out by years of Communism.\nNow keep this in mind about the future of socialism in the US as the US mass imports Africans, Middle Easterners and South Americans.",

Because he said \"Evil Jewish leaders\"? So then the Shah was anti-Semitic because he said Jews control all of the USA? Then, you have Hagee who says anti-Semitic things in his sermons. Like \"all Jews will die when they don't turn to Jesus\" or that's not anti-Semitic? Or Billy Graham and his speeches?\n\nBut even Netanyahu said \"Hilter didn't want to kill the Jews, not until he met (some imam or someone). Is that anti-Semitic? What if Israel arms neo-nazis in Ukraine? No? So many rules...I guess we'll never know.",

If Trump resigns, he's no longer protected from prosecution by being a \"sitting president\". So...no resignation. What if Trump loses in 2020? He's open to prosecution. So...what does he do? He claims the election was sabotaged by Hillary/Obama and the Democrats and he'll call for nationwide violence to protect him. What if he wins in 2020? He'll try to change the Constitution to allow for a third term, which will force the people to rise up, whereupon he'll call for violence in that case also. This will not end well unless the military quietly remove him and replace him with Pence.",

The only individual to 'stoke' violence has been our current president. Do you not remember all the rallies when he brought up violence? I am sure you selective memory won't allow that bob. All of you people (those that believe similarly) need to grow up and understand the world is leaving you behind. We will simply ignore you into non existence. Movements like this b.s. will not last long or take hold it's not the thirties anymore dictatorship isn't seen as benefiting society so good night and good luck.",
