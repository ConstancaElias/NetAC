        "postText": "'The Women and Equalities select Committee has said that too little is being done to enforce age discrimination law leading to an unacceptable waste of the talents of more than one million people aged over 50 who are unemployed.', 'MPs said that the Government needs to be clearer  that prejudice, unconscious bias and casual ageism in the workplace are all unlawful under the Equality Act 2010.', 'Conservative committee chairwoman Maria Miller said the scale and lack of enforcement uncovered by its inquiry was both alarming and totally unacceptable.', 'Entitled Older People And Employment, the report concluded the employer-led nature of the Government's approach was unlikely to present an adequate challenge to discriminatory practices or attitudes.', 'The committee said it wanted to see recruitment agencies accept greater responsibility,collecting data on where older workers are being excluded and developing a plan of action to remove discrimination from the recruitment process .', 'It recommended the reporting of the age profile of workforces following the introduction of gender pay gap reporting to challenge discrimination.', 'The report noted: It is unacceptable that the nation is wasting the talents of more than one million people aged over 50 who are out of work but would be willing to workif the right opportunity arose.', 'People in later life are often playing many different roles in society, but those who wish to work should not face the current barriers of discrimination, bias and outdated employment practices.', 'It added: Too little is being done to enforce the law.', 'Neither the Government or the Equality and Human Rights Commission(EHRC), with its considerable enforcement powers, are intervening in the recruitment sector where so much of the evidence demonstrates unlawful ways of working.', 'The public sector struggles to retain older workers when it should be leading the way, but the EHRC is not investigating whether the public sector equality duty is being met. We want it to do so.', 'The report urged a mandatory approach to flexible working, adding: We recommend that flexible working be the default from the time jobs are advertised onwards.', 'Many older workers often take on a range of caring responsibilities.', 'The Government should therefore introduce a statutory entitlement to five days paid carer's leave, and a longer period of unpaid leave, to help stop those caring for a loved one falling out of the labour market unnecessarily.', 'Commenting on the report, Mrs Miller said: Age discrimination in the workplace is a serious problem, as many older people have discovered.', 'Yet despite it being unlawful for more than a decade, the scale and lack of enforcement uncovered by our inquiry is both alarming and totally unacceptable.', 'The Government and the EHRC have failed to get to grips with this.', 'They must be more robust in providing a remedy to potentially unlawful working practices in the recruitment sector.'",
