        "postText": "The debate on trans issues in the UK over the last few years has been turbulent to say the least.', 'Experts on trans rights and people who have been working in the field for decades are being pitted against almost anyone with a negative opinion about trans people \u2013 regardless of who they are.', 'This seems to be a trend among anti-trans campaigners; they\u2019re given a platform despite their lack of knowledge or experience of the discussion they\u2019re taking part in.', 'As an example, in a controversial move, Scottish MP Joan McAlpine has just invited Canadian writer Meghan Murphy, founder of the blog Feminist Current, to speak at the Scottish Parliament about \u2018how transgender ideology affects women\u2019s rights\u2019.', 'Murphy\u2019s blog has long been known for its strong anti-trans stance and regularly publishes material that advocates against trans rights and discusses the alleged dangers of the \u2018transgender lobby\u2019. It is a go-to-site for strong anti-trans campaigners.', 'It would be safe to say that Murphy herself has no expertise, qualifications or experience with transgender rights.', 'She has even been banned from Twitter for life for breaching its community standards of hateful conduct in November last year, because of targeted harassment towards specific individuals based on their gender identity.', 'Her invitation to this discussion therefore seems quite out of touch, such as if a climate change denier was invited to discussion about how to stop the catastrophic damage we are doing to our planet.', 'Or if a representative of the Flat Earth Society was invited to a discussion about an upcoming space expedition by NASA.', 'What this essentially does is endorse and imply that anti-trans campaigners are on an equal footing with people who have real expertise in the matter.', 'If the Scottish Parliament, and the UK as a whole, truly wants to have constructive and valuable discussions about transgender issues, they need to stop giving platforms to anti-trans voices who base their arguments on misinformation, fear and lack of evidence.', 'Similar events have occurred in England. In March 2018, Conservative MP David Davies hosted a meeting at Parliament where Sheila Jeffreys, a feminist professor from Melbourne, referred to trans women as suffering from \u2018parasitism\u2019, and other known anti-trans campaigners also spoke against trans rights.', 'Meanwhile, earlier this year, writer Graham Lineham, who has been criticised by trans activists, spoke about trans kids. His comments were widely covered in national media, despite him having no experience, qualifications or expertise in the field whatsoever.', 'If the Scottish Parliament, and the UK as a whole, truly wants to have constructive and valuable discussions about transgender issues, they need to stop giving platforms to anti-trans voices who base their arguments on misinformation, fear and lack of evidence.', 'People who fundamentally do not believe trans people are the gender they know themselves to be, and who deliberately and repeatedly misgender and misrepresent people\u2019s identities and personhood, can never be seen as reasonable representatives of this debate.', 'Trans people are who they say they are, and any conversation that doesn\u2019t acknowledge this is inherently flawed and biased.', 'The event being hosted at the Scottish Parliament will undoubtedly radicalise people against trans rights, with tactics common within anti-feminist, anti-human rights and right-winged politics.', 'These groups and individuals are disguising themselves as protectors of the rights of \u2018women and girls\u2019, but it\u2019s time we see them for what they truly are: misguided people with conservative and fundamentalist views about sex and gender.', 'They do not want equality, but supremacy.', 'I therefore urge the Scottish Parliament and the UK as a whole to tread cautiously, and demand critical and evidence-based discussion on trans rights going forward.', 'For too long anti-trans campaigners have been given ample opportunity to spread misinformation and fear about trans people and their lives.', 'We cannot pretend that the UK respects the rights of transgender people unless we are willing to make serious changes in our social and legal environment, and ensure that trans people are no longer treated as second-class citizens.', 'Despite trans and cis people having different experiences of gender-based oppression, our experiences undeniably intersect on a multitude of levels.', 'Everyone must be seen as equal to one another, regardless of their background.', 'Trans rights are human rights, and true liberation will never be achieved until we are all fully included.",

Your sexuality is your own choice but why do we have to have it in the spotlight all the time?  If you're a man and you want to be a <b> woman </b>or vice versa, so be it, go and get your surgery, dress and act accordingly and be done with it.It's nobody's business but your own. Just stop flaunting yourselves and attracting attention ( most of it negative .) Have a little class. You would be more respected!  Don't get children involved either.  You leave them alone and let them decide on their own accord, once they've reached adulthood. Enough already!",

We have to have it in the spotlight because these things are still happening. People would dearly love to 'be done with it', but aren't given that option when the abuse is daily. Why shouldn't a <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>couple be able to show the same affection and love as any other couple? Whether you like it or not, children are involved. Children aren't blank-minded possessions that just flip a switch at 18 and suddenly become adults with their own thoughts. Did you never have a crush on someone or <b> a sexua</b>l thought until you reached adulthood? You know that's nonsense. I agree that we need to take great care with the issues around trans children, but demonising parents a<b> nd docto</b>rs isn't going to help.",

I can't blame you, as how you describe it is generally how we're portrayed in the popular consciousness but i promise you we do not get treatment quickly or easily.It took 4 years, 2 general psychotherapist and 4 <b> gender </b>identity specialist meetings, plus a year of group counselling before i was signed off on starting hormone replacement therapy. since that time i have been awaiting GRS (which for the record is not exactly 'cutting off your crown jewels'). Strictly that should have been done with about 3 years ago but due to failings in other areas of the NHS and fitness for surgery issues that hasn't materialised.This is just the time i've been medically transitioning and while it would be cliche to say i've known all my life i can pinpoint my first memory something was up at 7 years<b>  old</b>, 20 years ago, along with when i first had a word for i<b> t ag</b>e 11 or 12.I'm glad you have the attitude of live and let live but the lack of understanding (and statements showing it) betrays that you either haven't had a chance to listen to our stories, haven't listened when told, or decided we're actively lying.As i say it's understandable that your opinions have formed the way they have but please reconsider the harmful statements that inform them. Also, thanks for reading i guess?",

Every cell in our bodies. Is it really unreasonable, biased and \"supremacist\" to point any of this out?4) I don't see this \"everything else is unreasonable, biased or else for their own supremacy\" pretty militant in their disinformation and spin lobby being terribly transparent about the plethora <b> of docto</b>rs and plastic surgeons and pharmaceutical companies who support those who attempt to change th<b> eir gen</b>der, since they have to have $urgery or take hormone$ for the rest of their lives, and further, since this is the first generation of what amounts to experimenting with children, no-one knows the long-term consequences of such intervention experiments. 5) Oh well, after surgery<b>  the se</b>xual experience is more \"spiritual\".

You're implying only \"leading experts\" that suit your agenda are valid and anyone who thinks otherwise must have \"qualifications\" to disagree. No. From what I've read by those more \"qualified\" to have an opinion that is not just a comment on an ill-written tabloid story, the scientific studies are flawed and may be skewed to fit an agenda in favour of intervention that benefits the medical and pharmaceutical industries in countries such as the US, where it is a for-profit business, as well as for people who simply say or believe they are trans, including children, and want the operations. You/they are not the only \"experts\" to have a say. There is another side, that has, in my opinion, more cogent and <b> common </b>sense arguments, such as the ones I outlined above. It doesn't help your cause to try and stifle all opposition as irrelevant, ignorant or worse.",
