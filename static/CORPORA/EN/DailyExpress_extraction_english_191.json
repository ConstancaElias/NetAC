        "postText": "Beattie, famed for her telephone calls to family in the series of television adverts, features in a video warning that the Labour leader has an \u201can ology\u201d in extremism.', 'In the film she also raises fears that Mr Corbyn\u2019s plan to nationalise the internet will mess up her broadband after she has finally got the hang of video-calls with her grandchildren.', 'Speaking on the phone to friend Nora, the Jewish star tells a friend: \u201cOf course, we were all Labour, everybody voted Labour. I voted Labour all my life.', '\u201cYou know what my late husband said? If you\u2019re Jewish, they gave you your Labour Party badge the day after your circumcision. They gave with one hand, they took with the other.', '\u201cBut this lot\u2026 this lot\u2019s not Labour. They\u2019re not socialists. You know what they are, Nora? They\u2019re extremists, that\u2019s what my Melvyn says, and he\u2019s not often wrong.', '\u201cThen there\u2019s the throwing around of the millions of pounds. Where\u2019s he going to get that from?\u201d', 'The Coronation Street star was renowned in the 1980s and 1990s for the advertisements, including one where she told her grandson that she was proud he had got \u201can ology\u201d in sociology despite failing his other exams.', 'The video was produced by the Mainstream campaign launched by former Labour MP Ian Austin, who has said he will vote for Boris Johnson to stop Mr Corbyn taking power.', 'He said: \u201cPeople like Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell have spent decades working with and defending all sorts of extremists and in some cases terrorists and antisemites.', '\u201cUnder their leadership, Labour has been poisoned by racism, extremism and intolerance. They can\u2019t be trusted to defend our country and they can\u2019t be trusted with our democracy. A government led by them would mean other extreme policies like massive tax rises, alongside daft ideas like giving free broadband to people who can already afford it.\u201d",
