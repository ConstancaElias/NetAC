But not to protest against what is being taught at school, parents should not intervene! Parents educate their children at home, and the State educate children in the schools!, where the children learn how to respect each other and learn the basics of our societies! There should be no tolerance on those so call \"parents\" who protest what is being taught in our school especially when respect is being taught!",
