It's a shame DCFS and CPS and ORS have placed so many laws and incentives 4 removing fathers from their children. I understand some cases the child needs to be protected. A child needs a father as well cutting all ties with Father's and children and replacing the one who used to be the head of the household with money / child support this sad practice is turning Generations into full grown infants. If you spare the rod you spoil the child it's time we be allowed to spank children in public when they need an attitude adjustment. Spare the rod spoil the child.",

So everyone needs to forgive her. but not tolerate her actions!! What makes this country soo great is that we all  have the right to think what ever you want. But her views have no place in our government she is supposed to be representing the people of her district not the people of her  culture!!! For only that reason she needs to leave office for the good of all American's! There's no place for hate or religious beliefs in our government. She was elected to serve the people not a agenda!!!",

All of us in America were granted the constitutional rights to freedom of speech, opinions and to bear arms. DONT SUPPORT HAVING IT RESTRICTED EVEN MORE, over some silly political game like this.  Dont you people actually WANT to have more politicians that expose,. discuss and criticize the corrupt lobbyists that influence our govt ? Use your fkin goy brains for once.",

Facts are facts, Congresswomen Omar's was talking about the obsessive attention given to one outside government and its influences on American governance; she did not make any anti-Semitic remarks. Listen to Mrs. Hallie Soifer, who happens to be Jewish, state the Omar was not being anti-Semitic while speaking before Congress. In this case The true anti-semites are those attacking Omar. The racial hate card is often used in this way when ever Israel is mentioned as being an unfair influence. God Bless America for fighting to be fair and just with all people.",

There's always going to be bullies, bigots and spoiled rich snubs that think they are better than you. The problem lies in how you deal with it. In politics because Omar is \"favored\" a mother hen will be there to clean up after her childish antics. However, attacking the first amendment with this Bill or Act whichever you choose to call it is an intrusion on the everyday lives of every American. So you don't like your neighbor? Is that now a crime to speak behind their back even though we were taught we shouldn't? Someone makes fun of you in school because your a guy and you decided to wear a dress? Well me for one I would probably have a few wise cracks to say but all in good fun/humor. This new Act/Bill would condone those wisecracks as a crime and send a lot of people to jail. So if you like to speak freely fight this.",

There needs to be an application test to be a congressperson to be a representative. That even if you are elected by the majority you must pass this test. Governmental obligations to the people, American history, immorality questionnaire. And a simple IQ test. If you can't pass these you don't get to be a representative or congressperson. And your seat will automatically go to your opponent if they pass the test. If neither pass the test then you don't get representation.",
