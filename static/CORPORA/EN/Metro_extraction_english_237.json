        "postText": "More than 70 schools are facing \u2018pressure and intimidation\u2019 as protests against LGBT relationship lessons are \u2018growing across the country\u2019, a Labour MP has warned.', 'Emma Hardy said misinformation over relationship education is \u2018vast and in danger of spreading\u2019 and accused the government for not doing enough to prevent it.', 'It comes after last night\u2019s BBC Panorama documentary suggested the Department for Education pressured Parkfield Community School in Birmingham to suspend its equality programme to avoid media attention.', 'Asking an urgent question in the House of Commons, Ms Hardy said: \u2018Over 70 schools are now seeing pressure and intimidation because of school leaders fulfilling their legal duty under the Equality Act.', '\u2018It is clear from last night\u2019s Panorama programme that protests against relationship education are growing across the country\u2019.', 'Minister for school standards Nick Gibb said he and Education Secretary Damian Hinds \u2018strongly encourage primary schools to teach LGBT relationships\u2019.', 'He added: \u2018Parents have a right to understand what we are requiring schools to teach and how their child\u2019s school is intending to go about it.', '\u2018That\u2019s why we will be requiring schools to consult parents on their relationships education or RSE policy, but open and constructive dialogue can only work if the facts of the situation are known to all.', '\u2018We are aware that misinformation is circulating about what schools currently teach about relationships and what they will teach when the new subjects are introduced.\u2019', 'Ms Hardy said there was a \u2018desperate need for clear, firm leadership from the department\u2019.', 'She added: \u2018It would also appear from last night\u2019s Panorama programme that pressure was applied from the Department for Education to Parkfield School to suspend their equality programme to get the school out of the national news.', '\u2018This has led to copycat protests elsewhere as protesters believe that if they make enough noise and turn up the loudhailers and hurl abuse at head teachers that other schools will back down too.\u2019', 'She asked if Mr Gibb would update guidance to schools to ensure they have a clear message about the need to teach LGBT-inclusive sex and relationship education \u2013 which is mandated by the government and checked by Ofsted.', 'Mr Gibb did not accept the department was too slow to respond to protests outside Parkfield School, which went on for several months.', 'He added: \u2018We\u2019ve been working very closely with senior officials, working very closely with the school.', '\u2018We do want to achieve maximum consensus with this relationship education, that\u2019s why there\u2019s a requirement to publish the policy on the school\u2019s website, that\u2019s in regulations and to consult parents, it\u2019s in the statutory guidance.', '\u2018But ultimately it is a matter for the school itself to decide on the curriculum, and when the school has decided on what it wants to teach and when, it will (have) the full support and backing of the DfE and from ministers.\u2019', 'Shadow education secretary and Angela Rayner said the guidance needed to go further.', 'She told MPs: \u2018I do not believe that the issues that are coming up is about consultation.', '\u2018It\u2019s about LGBT and misinformation that has been given out and the bigotry that is being displayed by some minorities on our streets. We have to hit back.\u2019', 'Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley Jess Philips said: \u2018If the minister thinks that the guidance is right he maybe wants to come and live where I live.', '\u2018What we are up against here is racists and homophobes who are trying to put what they think on the children where I live.\u2019', 'Mr Gibb responded: \u2018She says if we had only changed the wording of the guidance to make it more of a requirement \u2013 I don\u2019t believe that would have prevented the protest that she is seeing at the Birmingham schools.', '\u2018Because there is a segment of opinion at either end of this debate that will not be persuaded of the appropriateness of this guidance.\u2019",

In addition, there are also non-muslim people who are protesting against these LQBTQ+ inclusive lessons. It is not fair to blame this on the muslim community as a whole.However, I do agree that some of our politicians and public servants are so scared of being accused of <b> racism </b>that they often refuse to act when they should. That is a failure on their part however, an again is not the fault of the wider muslim community.",

Will the Govt up hold the law and support school to resume school curriculum. other wise Islamist will continue - than we should make it claer to our punblic that we are moving England to a Islamic state.",

There's no \"Christophobia\" or \"Buddhophobia\" or \"Hinduphobia\" for example, while Anti-Semitism is more racially based than an attack on Judaism itself.Forty years ago, it wouldn't have surprised me to see other religions protesting outside schools, but we've moved on since then and the majority of Jews and Christians now accept<b>  LG<b> BT<<b> /b</b</b>>>+ equality, with many welcoming us as parishioners with full sacraments, including ordination to the clergy and s<b> ame-</b>sex marriage.Islam presents a far more difficult challenge.  Although the majority of British Muslims obey the law, and tolerate the existenc<b> e o<b> f <<b> /b</b</b>>>LGBT+ people, polls still show a majority opposed to full equality, such as the right to marry.  It is to be hoped the Islamic teaching again<b> st s</b>ame-sex relationships<b>  be<b> tw<<b> /b</b</b>>>een LGBT+ people will moderate, as the Jewish and Christian teachings have, but it still remains to be seen.The current protests demonstrate that many still think that homosexuality is not an innate 'God given' trait, and believe that it is just heterosexuals choosing to mate wi<b> th t</b>he same sex, for hitherto unexplained reasons.",
