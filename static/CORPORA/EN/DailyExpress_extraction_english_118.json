        "postText": "Labour\u2019s Shadow Home Secretary Ms Abbott has hit out at Fiona Bruce for whipping up a hostile atmosphere, with her supporters also finding she was interrupted more than any other guests during Thursday\u2019s programme. But Isabel Oakeshott, former political editor of The Sunday Times, has taken aim at Ms Abbott following claims she was singled out due to her race. Ms Oakeshott spotted Ms Abbott on the train to the BBC studio and despite being tempted to move to a different seat due to a difference of political opinions, she remained where she was in a bid to be polite. But the same could not be said for fellow panelist Ms Abbott, she said.', 'In an opinion piece for the Spectator, Ms Oakeshott said: By contrast, the Shadow Home Secretary could not be bothered with the most basic civilities. In 15 years at Westminster I\u2019ve rarely seen such bad manners \u2013 but that is by the by.', 'She goes on to blast the Labour Party and grassroots support group Momentum for fuelling claims Ms Abbott was interrupted more than any other guest because of political bias, racism or sexism - despite there being two other women on the show with Ms Abbott.', 'Ms Oakeshott said: As this entirely confected row has dragged on, some Labour type with far too much time on their hands has worked out that Abbott was interrupted significantly more often than other panellists.', 'The best explanation her supporters can come up with for this is racism, sexism or political bias on the part of the BBC.', 'The truth is much simpler: she talks agonisingly slowly, opening up plenty of opportunities for intervention. And once she starts, she never stops. If we all waited politely for her to finish, nobody else would ever speak.', 'She later added: The confected row over the Shadow Home Secretary\u2019s treatment on the show showcases all that is rotten about the current Labour leadership, and the warped priorities of deeply unpleasant Momentum activists behind it.', 'Ms Oakeshott goes on to blast Labour for its stance on Brexit and for being too childish to attend talks with Prime Minister Theresa May to resolve the Irish backstop issue as invited.', 'She said: Perhaps if they spent less time pursuing trumped up grievances, and more time coming up with credible policies, they would have some chance of ousting the Tories.', 'Ms Abbott\u2019s team and Momentum activists demanded an apology from the BBC and Ms Bruce, who was widely applauded for he performance on the show.', 'But both have refused, and now Labour have demanded unedited footage of the programme be made public.', 'A BBC spokesman said: We are sorry to hear Diane Abbott's concerns over Thursday's edition of Question Time and we have contacted her team to reassure them that reports circulating on social media are inaccurate and misleading.', 'Diane is a regular and important contributor to the programme.', 'As we said earlier, we firmly reject claims that any of the panel was treated unfairly either before or during the recording.'",
