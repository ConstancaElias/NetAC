        "postText": "If there\u2019s ever a project that needs women\u2019s perspective right now, it\u2019s Brexit.', 'The project led by Conservative male politicians nursing a grudge over losing power 25 years ago over an EU currency mechanism \u2013 with fallout known as Black Wednesday \u2013 has dragged all of us into their boys\u2019 club fight about getting their own back on Europe.', 'The project voted on by a parliament in which men outnumber women two to one; analysed by Brexit departments in which there are 17% more male senior civil servants than women; reported on by a parliamentary press pack where men outnumber women by four to three.', 'The project that is in serious trouble because a so-called democratic vote failed from the outset to consider the lived experiences of the \u2018other\u2019 half of the population; and for which many women gave their support as a proxy to express their disgust with representatives who had entirely failed to represent them.', 'The Women\u2019s Equality Party has consistently campaigned for a feminist outcome whatever route Brexit takes, because we see this crisis as made possible by years of austerity that, while pretending immigration was to blame, was in fact targeting women.', 'Women funded 86% of the government\u2019s austerity savings from tax and benefit changes because the government\u2019s idea of economic growth doesn\u2019t see the unpaid, invisible labour that underpins it \u2013 nor care about those invisible women\u2019s reliance on public spending and public services, which are always the first part of the budget to be slashed.', 'It\u2019s an issue that neither Leave nor Remain confronted.', 'And in all of these scenarios women, who earn less than men, will suffer more.', 'Women are primary carers for children and relatives in a country where that choice is often not a choice because childcare is by some estimates the  most expensive in the world.', 'Women are more likely to work in healthcare, childcare and in public sectors because they have been funneled from school into industries by gendered ideas of what they\u2019re good at \u2013 to find that what women are good at is the work our society values and pays least.', 'Throughout the referendum, women\u2019s questions about what was next for them went unheard.', 'With the ongoing failure of those negotiating Brexit to address such urgent questions from the people who suffered the most from the last national crisis, I am asking party members at next weekend\u2019s conference to consider backing a people\u2019s vote.', 'Let me be clear: I am not asking for a second referendum. I am asking for women\u2019s involvement in the first.', 'The harping on by politicians of all stripes about \u2018British Jobs\u2019 from Brexit completely ignores the British jobs currently being done by women on low and no pay and the impact on them from a bad deal or no deal. There is an obsession among both the Conservatives and Labour about manufacturing, and an arrogant dismissal of those in the care and service industries.', 'The Tories are now steered by the European Research Group that aims for a business-friendly bonfire of red tape (read: workers\u2019 rights) to the benefit of a small number of already wealthy men. Labour prizes above all the creation of working class men\u2019s jobs via nationalisation like the holy grail of our disconnection from the EU.', 'The coming post-Brexit economic slowdown \u2013 economists differ only on the extent \u2013 means that men\u2019s unemployment will increase. When this happens, government will respond as successive governments always have: by investing in construction projects to create men\u2019s jobs and funding them by cuts to public sector jobs and money on which women rely.', 'As research by Women for a People\u2019s Vote shows, one million women\u2019s jobs could be affected by Brexit, as public money for the NHS, for social care, for nurses and carers, dries up still further. That same research shows that women now back remaining in the EU by a margin of 12 percentage points at 56% to 44%; compared to 51% of women voting leave in 2016.', 'Other sectors that employ a majority of women, such as textiles and food, will face 5% tariffs under World Trade Organisation rules. Paying these tariffs will not just mean further cuts to public sector spending, but pressure on the sectors themselves that could lead to significant job losses as businesses come under strain.', 'The ensuing impact on supply chains and food prices will hit the poorest households \u2013 who spend nearly a quarter of their income on food \u2013 the hardest.', 'And in all of these scenarios women, who earn less than men, will suffer more.', 'Politicians can stop scoffing about \u2018project fear\u2019. In this country, women are already living it. Their swing to support for Remain is another swing at representatives who continue to entirely fail to represent them.",

Choosing not to vote doesn't mean they still aren't eligable to vote. 33,577,342 voted in total -- not bad in a country with a population of 65.4 million (including children). You can't have it both ways by the way. Either 72.2% turnout is large or it is small. A majority of 1,269,241 million people on a turnout of 72.2% is either large or small. I would suggest it is quite large.Happy <b> Brexit.</b>",
