        "postText": "The MP who urged the Prime Minister to apologise for \u2018racist and derogatory remarks\u2019 about Muslim women says his response in Parliament doesn\u2019t cut it.', 'Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi drew applause in the Commons yesterday after calling Boris Johnson out on past comments in which he likened women wearing burqas to letter boxes.', 'He really wasn\u2019t impressed with Johnson\u2019s reaction and said his Sikh and Muslim ancestry doesn\u2019t give him \u2018carte blanche\u2019 to say what he likes.', 'The Labour MP has renewed his calls for the Conservative Party to begin its review into Islamophobia, as promised by Johnson during his leadership campaign.', 'He told Metro.co.uk: \u2018He still didn\u2019t apologise, that\u2019s what he should have done. It\u2019s a pathetic response.', '\u2018His answer should have been, I apologise for my derogatory remarks, I take those back\u2019.', 'To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrowser that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupports HTML5\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvideo', 'This is a modal window.', 'Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.', 'End of dialog window.', 'He accused Johnson sidestepping his question about holding a review into Islamophobia as promised before becoming party leader.', 'Instead Johnson deflected with a remark about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.', 'The Prime Minister added: \u2018If the right honourable gentleman took the trouble to read the article in question, he would see it was a strong liberal defence of everybody\u2019s right to wear whatever they want in this country.', '\u2018And I speak as somebody who is not only proud to have Muslim ancestors but to be related to Sikhs such as himself.', '\u2018I\u2019m also proud to say this government has the most diverse cabinet in the history of this country.\u2019', 'Reflecting on yesterday\u2019s exchange, Dhesi said: \u2018He started to describe his family tree to me. I don\u2019t really need to know about Boris Johnson\u2019s family tree.', '\u2018I myself have a white Scottish aunt, I\u2019ve got Polish relatives, but that doesn\u2019t give me a carte blanche to say anything I like or anything disparaging against Scottish or Polish people.\u2019', 'Dhesi says politicians, figures in the media and other people with a lot of sway must chose their words carefully, as the impact of them can be serious.', 'He added: \u2018He knew full well the effect that his words would have. At that point in time he was pandering to an incredibly right wing Conservative Party membership.', 'He pointed out a survey of party members which revealed 56 per cent saw Islam as \u2018generally a threat\u2019 to the British way of life.', 'Singling out \u2018vulnerable\u2019 Muslim women led to a \u2018significant spike in hate crime\u2019 which saw people having their hijabs ripped off and being pelted with eggs and tomatoes, said Dhesi.', '\u2018He helped to normalise such disgraceful behaviour. He shouldn\u2019t be trying to mimic Donald Trump \u2013 we in the UK have higher standards,\u2019 he added.', '\u2018We\u2019ve made such great advances in the past few decades as a democratic society which is a beacon for those around the world.\u2019', 'The MP for Slough says he and colleagues \u2018are still waiting\u2019 for evidence of a independent review on Islamophobia in the Tory party being underway.', 'However last month Party Chairman James Cleverly confirmed a review would be carried out.', 'Dhesi made history when he became Britain\u2019s first turban wearing Sikh MP following the 2017 general election.', 'He and fellow Labour member Preet Kaur Gill are the only two Sikh MPs in the Commons.', 'Redbridge Council leader Jas Athwal has been nominated as Labour\u2019s next parliamentary candidate for Illford South.', 'If elected he would be the first BAME MP to represent the east London constituency.', 'When asked how he felt about another turban wearing Sikh joining the Commons, Dhesi said: \u2018It would be great to have a more diverse Parliament.', '\u2018There\u2019s still more work to be done. There are only two Sikh MPs, there should be at least half a dozen.\u2019', 'He said this on the basis that roughly one per cent of Britain\u2019s population of 66 million people identify as Sikh.",

I fear like most 'rights' this hate crime is getting out of hand 'hurt feeling all around' through just name calling or is that 'slurring'? If so I have been well and truly slurred in my life and it was not about my clothes that symbolised my religion, for I have no religion. It was about me, the person and I could not change what was called and I could not defend myself. I was just one person and no-one stood for me in parliament and there was no religion or movement that I belonged to, with which I identified to share my experience with. I have heard<b>  disabled</b> people called names and have intervened and thos<b> e disable</b>d people cannot change who they are and it is still going on and yet it is all about Islam now!In Muslim countries the Niqab is not an issue, although in some, westerners wearing bikinis can be or entering certain areas without being dressed in a certain way. I accept that and respect that, it is their countries and I abide by their rules. This is Britain and we have our rules, that are bing breeched in so very many ways. Resentment builds daily.It is to do with safety and CCTV, that is the main issue around the Niqab. full-face helmets have to be taken off for ID purposes in banks and certain official buildings and righly so and it is wrong that some do not have to show their faces. The right to protection by the workers and others, in those buildings is what should be paramount. I have heard so many wisecracks about and around the Niqab and I leave that to those who wish to do that. I cannot intervene other than to say I am n<b> ot raci</b>st but I am a realist and the Niqah was used to try to rob a bank I have only heard of one and also for some to evade identification, those are facts. It is <b> not rac</b>ist to say that the extrememist elements of Islam have no issues with doing anything to achieve what they set out to achieve and that is usually to kill the 'infidels' who are those of us who are not of them, in this1",

            "commentText": "Singh has got it wrong - he is not a muslim himself and he was not even acting on behalf of the muslim women borris called letter boxes. MP are supposed to represent thewir constituenty not make random comments. Also the narrative in the UK is that all communities need to intergrate and not abuse their freedoms. This was the point Borris should have made,, yes you can wear a hijab but do not insist on covering your face and do not abuse the freedom to be allowed to. Also singh is not a muslim he is a sikh, and muslims are used to being critiqued but sikhs and  jews are the actual minority and weill feel <b> racism </b>more. Also a muslim MP would never stick up for a sikh or jew minority. so why does he feel the need to stick up for muslim who are not intergrating ?",
