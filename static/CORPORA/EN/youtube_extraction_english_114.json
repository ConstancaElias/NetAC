They always told me that I am learning for myself and this depens on what future I would like to have. So when I didn't get an A in everything they weren't mad at all. But also they were very supported and proud. And my parents also convinced me to study what I like the most, because I was a bit scared to do it in case it wouldn't pay off.",

I'd be out drinking on the sreets at the <b> age </b>of thirteen,<b>  nobody</b> gave a damn about where I'd spend my nights. One time I got so drunk at 14 that my friends had to carry me home and just left me on my bed. I pissed myself, threw up and all <b> - nobod</b>y noticed. I was so glad to have gotten away with that the next morning, now I know that I could have died that night.\nI've been dealing wi<b> th alcoh</b>ol abuse on and off since then, now I'm 23, got my degree and haven't had a single drop in 13 months. I love my parents and know they love me, but what they loved even more was their careers. \nThey didn't only neglect me but also my younger siblings. When I was 14 my brothers were 3 and 5 ye<b> ars </b>old, they often got up at night to sleep in my parent's room or to get them to bring them back to bed and say goodnight one more time. My parents didn't like that and locked their door. Since I didn't have a key for my door, my brothers would both come into my bed to be close to somebody, and I had to share it with them which kept me from sleeping. I complained about it<b>  but not</b>hing changed. \nWhen all of this started to show and my grades got worse and worse, my parents would pretend that it was all my fault.\nI could go on telling these stories for hours and it truly sickens me. Both ends of the spectrum can be very damaging.",

Or maybe it could be her tactic the whole time? Knowing that I'm such a goody-two-shoes so there's no need for her to even try to be strict. And maybe a bit of reverse psychology too because her saying that she doesn't mind made me feel like maybe she does... Lol",

I'm also an introvert (INFP) and sometimes, I honestly want to just go out with friends, I don't like being cooped up all the time, but my parents never let me go out. They wonder why I am so quiet, well it's because I'm not trying to get in trouble because everything I say gets me in trouble. I end up setting high standards for myself and it becomes unbearable. My dream is to be a veterinarian when I grow up because I love working with animals, though I have never had a pet, but my parents says school comes first. 98% of the things you learn in school aren't useful for the future; we all know that. I swear I had a <b> mental </b>breakdown after my mom found out I had Reddit and was posting because Reddit is my escape and she took my phone away, took it back but now she is home and I was working on my keyboard so she left me alone (ending here before i get in trouble)",

            "commentText": "It's okay to just care about your children and be worried because of how dangerous the world can be, but there is a limit for how strict you can be. Sometimes, you just have to let your child go, let them be free and enjoy life. Your children aren't gonna grow up to be amazing people if you raised them like animals in a cage, it is not right. There are days when you can give your children your opinion but there are also days where THEY can share their opinion aswell, they have a life too, a life that they can control themselves, not you, they aren't your puppet. I grew up with strict parents so I know what it feels like, I'm not comfortable with sharing what happened in my life but all you have to know is that I gained paranoia from my surroundings, I was insecure, I couldn't tell what freedom was and I struggled so many times. This affected many things, like my attitude,socialising and mentality. It's easy to say that I wasn't very happy all the time. So please do know your limits and place for when you have a child, let them grow up to be an independent person, sure you can help them but for a moment, let them help themselves.",

My other neighbour, that is like a few houses away, is coming too and she's a girl.\n3. The only 2 guys in the house are her dad and her baby brother (or toddler).\n4. It's only for 1 night.\n\nThen, after more lengthy talks, she agrees (she almost made me bring the maid that takes care of me with me but I told her that my friend has 2 maids and there is no room for my maid to sleep in and bringing her is just a pain in the ass for her).\n\nYep, no more sleepovers again since then :) ... But I stay in my friend's house until it's like 10 so whatever. She lives in front of my house anyway.",

They are rather acquaintances since I've never been allowed to see them outside of school more than 4 times in my high school (I'll be graduating in 2 weeks). Texting them, I learned I was desperate for a friend and I eventually was able to tell that I made a fool of myself because I'm overall socially incompetent. That's why none of them would care if I stopped texting them. It would never cross their minds and they would rather converse with somebody else than with who they don't have to (like me), so they can be polite. University is gonna be a long and tough road because I know for a fact I will find myself distracted by those who have the basic freedoms I don't have. I'll be wondering about what they do and what I wish I could do with their privileges because I know no matter how hard I work in university, it's only gonna pay off in helping me get a job. Not a proper social life or experiences that come with it. At least my dad said that he won't care about what I do with my life once I'm 21 and from then on he'll consider me an adult (yeah like hell he will). yippee I can't wait to finally do basic things on my own",

I really wanted to hang out with my friend cuz she might move schools next year and I wanted to have the opportunity to gain the best moments of our friendship because I really do love her as my best friend and I am absolutely heart broken to hear that she's moving soon but my mom is just holding me back every single time. I just hope that one day JUST ONE DAY, she'll let me step my foot out of the house to the mall to have fun. Honestly, strict parents are one of the worst kind of parents ever cuz they don't ever understand what you're going through and then just expects you to behave like they wanted you to. We're not ragdolls which just sits at one spot until it was controlled, we need to go out too sometimes. Mom, step up your game, please",

If I was out with my friends past 7 at night even in summer I had to phone her every hour so she knew what I was doing and if I missed one phone call off her I would get in trouble like I remember once I went to the toilet and had a missed call from her... apparently \"almost wetting myself\" wasn't a good enough excuse to miss a phone call! And my absolute favourite was her bitching that me getting a bad grade on a test was because I didn't study enough yet she would moan at me if I studied too much because \"I need to do something else to take a break\" like get a grip<b>  woman</b>! xxx",

But one time my close friend was spreading rumours about me and talking bad and my best friend just so happened to go to that specific sleep over and cane back and told me everything so that close friend is not so close anymore. Anyways. My brother can go to the mall with friends have sleepovers with girls! and I'm not even allowed one with just me and my best friend. \ud83d\ude2d but yeah I got side tracked\n\n\n\nStrict parents ease deceptive liars. Meaning we will lie to get out of trouble. And at one point all my teachers said I was lying when I said I handed in my project and turns out I did! But my teachers couldn't find it\n\nYeah...... K bye now\n\n\n\nWait\nAlso it puts a lot of stress on you and I am under a lot of pressure. And I self harm and have depression and anxiety but I'm pushing through",

            "commentText": "i don't have strict parents but recently i had to do a group project with this girl who had an EXTREMELY strict mum.\n\nso we finished school at 2pm+, it took an hour to get to one of the other groupmate's house (including buying lunch), and her mum showed up at 3:20pm, literally like 20 minutes after we got to the house.\n\nshe was demanding that said group mate went home\u2014 but we hadn't even started the damned project. \n\nthe groupmate asked to stay for another 15 minutes and that we'd rush it somehow. the mum asked if that was even enough time\u2014 so my groupmate asked 'okay, how about 20 minutes?' which meant she'd have to go home at 3:40pm or so. what pissed me off is that the mum got mad right after and said 'why? you might as well just stay until 9pm!' like wtf, it was just 5 more minutes?\n\nwe were literally STRESSING. because we needed to film, meaning we needed her in the damn shot with us. the mum got impatient and asked us to hurry and said something like 'none of you have time management at all!' well SORRY we live far from our school. \n\na while later she said 'you might as well stay the night!' i found her really unreasonable. we couldn't contact our groupmate through group chats either because she said that her mum looks through her phone and that her mum thought we were done with the project. \n\nwe're still in the process of finishing the project, we're relying on some heavy editing for this.",

(it stopped working after the first update) Also, I am not allowed to have any sort of social media. The only reason I was able to watch YouTube was to convince them that I couldn't actually reply to other people's comments. I am never allowed to leave the house unless it is for an academic event, and the only time I have ever been to someone else's house was for a birthday party when I was in preschool. Meanwhile, my sister, who is two years younger than me, got her first electronic device when she was 9. She has access to social platforms that she is allowed to communicate with people on, without having to hide it from our parents. Also, she rarely leaves the house for academic events, but mostly sleepovers, playdates, and social events. And then when I ask my parents why this is the way it is, they say, \"Life isn't fair.\" So I just go up to my room and comment on more comments on more videos. Or make my own comments. But whatever. They'll see that it wasn't the right thing to do once I'm in college and not talking to them ever again. Unless that's what they're waiting for. I'm not really sure.",

My grades need to be above a B-. Chores always need to be done, no procrastinating allowed. I usually can't go anywhere after like 7 without adults being present. I'm under 16 so whoever drives me has to be an adult or a highschool that my mom trusts. My dad won't let me wear a lot of stuff and I wasn't allowed to dye my hair, or even cut it until 14. Heels aren't allowed and neither was makeup till 13. Boyfriends not until 14. If I'm out with my sisters we need to be back around 6 or in the summer when the streetlights come on. The only exception is when we're at the library or in a significantly large group of kids.",

While I'm from a country where certain types of parents hate you for being a girl and make u completely incapable of doing anything other than housework.....yes, too much study pressure is a different kind of problem and tht needs to be addressed...I'm just happy that I'm getting an education and some rights and freedom...life is very different when you are not allowed to date cause if you do...u r literally forced to marry or locked up or killed by family in name of Honor killing...u are not allowed to study, pursue a career or wear anything revealing..\nNot allowed to talk to boys, not explained about <b> sex,</b> expected to marry inside caste... not given any choice...u can't talk back, dance or play or learn to ride a bike(motercycle) be sweet and nice and most importantly obedient ...I can go on but u get the point.....

I've watched so many videos about depression, along with a ton of comments talking about their experiences. I personally do not have the condition, but I've been trying to understand it. I've never actually laughed about this kind of stuff... but. idk. maybe it's a dark... sense of humor???? or that's just an excuse. have no idea. sometimes I find myself using lol a lot without realizing it means \"laugh out loud\" \n\nOh. and yeah, I take it back, my parents are a little overprotective, but not really that strict. \n\nBut thanks for saying that, really. I'll try to be more careful when talking about this kind of stuff, cuz it feels like 60% of the population has depression for some reason. or 40%. or maybe less... there are basically just so many people struggling, and I don't want to be a sociopath or, idk, someone else hanging around in the corner while all that stuff happens.\n\nI... sometimes find myself switching between trigger happy kawaii bubbly person to serious person sorta fast... not going to say lol. but I don't have bipolar or something\n\nHave a good day! Thank you, once again. <3",

How are children and teenagers supposed to grow up into functioning adults when they are never allowed to interact with other people let alone leave the house except for school? This is such an American thing - you are all so afraid of your own bodies and sexuality that little girls are treated like harlots because they wear normal skirts and clothes! Ridiculous country.",

And they still weren't convinced that I needed extracurriculars for college, though academics alone wouldn't cut it. So for the few weeks in the year when I was out until 7 or 8pm on a school night because I was heavily involved in certain clubs or activities, they would be freaking out on me.

(The only places I can go is to a store not even 1 mile from my house and I can like ride my bike in the parking lot since we own a store).My brother can do anything and I can't do anything so sexist much...ugh",

I'm 18 now & the only rules I have now is that I can't be out later than 8 & I cannot be in a room alone with a boy, & not skip school but I'm too scared to do that anyway. It gets better guys!",

My mother used to be very strict about a lot of things and now that I'm older (17) and she's getting older, she realized that restricting me a lot was depriving me of enjoying my childhood to the fullest, and sadly the same was done to her when she was younger. Now she's much more lenient and loves meeting my friends (male, female, <b> gay<b> ,</b</b>> straight, trans, etc). My dad has never been strict and only requires that I hang out with the right people ( not drug addicts basically lol ) because I've never snuck out or done drugs and he completely trusts my judgment. They say having a great childhood/youth full of fun and making good decisions will make for a happy, wiser adult who is less likely to become sneaky and rebel. I think they're right!",

I have friends that their parents don't even teach things like don't spend too much, how to be humble, punctuality and other things too.\n\nFor example, in my house, im not allowed to switch on the air-conditioner whenever i want (except for hot days) & i can only turn it on during at night up until 4.30am (i have to set the air conditioner to switch off) cause my parents don't want to pay the electric bill up to 1000 a month just because we turn on the air-cond for the whole day and I have a like 4 siblings too. Imagine if all of us switch the air cond on for the entire day. \n\nIts a waste of money and electricity. It sounds silly doesnt it, but rules like that keeps you grounded.\n\nIts those things that makes who you are today.",

It will cause the child inner conflict and maybe rebel or whatever. \nI for one already go to Islamic school. Like it's awesome. Really just depends on what your teachers and the students are like. (They give me free food) XD anyways....\n\nYou don't HAVE to wear abaya or hijab. What U wear is YOUR choice. It's never a good idea to force someone to do something they don't want to do. \n\nInstead of abaya wear a long sleeved top that goes past your butt and some pants. Or just a dress. Having hijab is for modesty \n\nI wear hijab when I go out by my choice since I was young and since my mom wore it and was like,\" imma do that too\"",

I think in the span of my 4 High school years living with them I went only a total of 10 outings with friends. \nOh and I wasn't allowed to shower alone. I had to get my step mothers approval on how I looked ever morning before school. I've been late for school because she didn't like what I was wearing or how my hair was so I had to go back. I never bought my own clothing, that was also just on my bed when I would come home. Often clothing didn't fit (too small or short) but had to wear it anyway.\nSchool, I loved school I never wanted to leave school. School mean't freedom. I had a long time BF they kept trying to get me to break up with him. (we're married now 17 yrs together)\nAfter school I had and hour to walk 2 miles home. If I was even 10 min late. I was lectured and punished with earlier sleep time. I wasn't allowed to use to phone or watch tv. Had to clean the house every weekend often twice if even a little smudge was found. \nOften things were stolen from me. I was forced to get a job when I was 17 (not bad but I was unprepared for it) and because I wasn't 18 I had to put my money into my parents bank which I found out later they took $5000.00. For $1200 I bought a car when I was 18, learned to drive it and moved away.\nSo next time you think \"omg my parents are so strict.\" think of all the freedoms you do have.",

My mom and dad let me hang out with my friends and let them come for sleepover. They also let me wear anything that I want but I don't like to wear shorts in public except in my house. They always told me to come back home before 6:00 p.m. though and it's one of my routine now.",

Want to know what is wrong though? Being rude and saying \"Its an illness\", and other stuff about 'God' and no, not everybody loves God. Not everybody believes in God. So don't go around saying it's gods choice. Its not. Its their own choice.God is not the start of everything, TONS of people don't follow him, and its people like you that pis$ me off. It's not us that are wrong. It's You Marie. It's YOU. You are wrong. YOU are selfish. Not us. We can be who we want, it's what we consider ourselves, and you don't get to classify us.

Guess they're pretty laid-back after all! \n\nI'm 19, but since I'm still under their roof, I follow their rules which include no smoking, no drinking, and (of course) no <b> sex </b>before marriage... I've never really felt like breaking any of those rules anyway. The idea of getting hooked on smoking terrifies me (and I'm a singer), the thought of enjoying a wine or beer sounds nice, but I'm worried that I would become an alcoholic (seems to run on my dad's side with his uncles). I've never been with anyone, so there's no telling how easily I would cave to<b>  sex</b> in a relationship with someone, but I like to think that I have a level head.",

I'm legitimately scared of my dad because he always makes me look like a fool no matter what the situation is or if I'm being reasonable (which I usually try to be, but I guess him being in the debate club in high school makes him beg to differ). I get pretty stressed out, though. I'm sort of an outcast, but my dad gets this worried look on his face when I don't have anything if he asks how my friends are doing. So, I have to be social enough to keep him happy. Then, I have to stay on top of my grades. I was in high school credit courses in middle school, and didn't get a grade lower than a B in them, but when the report card and SOL (Virginia Standard of Learning tests) test scores came in with me passing advanced in all subjects, even getting a perfect score in writing, he focused on my only B (with all other grades being A's) and how I was close to getting only a Pass on two of the SOL's. Pretty uptight, but not quite strict.",

But I know one thing for sure, if I was given the opportunity to leave this life and have a new one with siblings, I would totally grab it. And only child with divorced parents and living with a strict mother is the worst combination because you get too much attention (yes, it's a thing) and might get, like me, insecure and awkward since you don't have anyone to make social experiments on without taking the risk of losing them (but that's got <b> nothing </b>to do with strict parents, it's an only child problem). Srlsy, enjoy the chaos because in my house it's silent and boring.",

I think that lots of parents, likely including the pair in this video, have different rules depending on the<b>  gender</b> of their children. The fact that the parents in this video put stricter rules on their daughter instead of their son reflects our culture's tendency to shelter women while giving men more privileges and greater freedom.",

You go to a party? you have to be 5 times more careful being a girl.\nOne time my (older) cousins and I went to a club, and one of them is super pretty so this guy who is staying down in the VIP area brings into our table bottles of expensive tequila and flowers. Turns out he's involved with the narcos and the staff had to get her out from a backdoor because they know exactly what happens to girls when they get that kind of attention from those people. \nIt's not that parents don't want you to go out and have fun, it's just that they know what's going on out there, they just want you to be safe.",

She tells me that I will never have the same rules that my brother has. It always frustrates me whenever she tells me that. When my brother was my<b>  age</b>, my mom let him go to his friend's house but for now my mom won't let me go out anywhere. And now my brother gets to play basketball at the park whenever he wants and he is still allowed to plays when it's dark outside. He can also go to his friend's house the whole day! He also has a girlfriend which he can go out with (to like the movies for example) and my parents don't need to be there with them. I would b<b> e craz</b>y if my parents would ever let me go out with my boyfriend. (Lol not like I have one cause I'm too young to date and plus I'm not attractive). My brother takes advantage of all these things that my parents let him do. I totally agree with you ; set the same rules for all your children. I've never seen a comment more relatable than this.",

You are more likely to be free of heartbreak, and your heart is a lot more open to love, if you have not spread it all over the place.

If you're not convinced, even after studying it in a cool-headed and an objective way (far from your emotions towards your arents) then yes, move to something else.\n\nAnyway work hard and try to go as far as possible to college and use your freedom wisely, choose the right friend and don't be with any guy who doesn't worth it (you must talk a lot before you start a relationship, for a few months actually,  to make sure you're compatible and you're not just a \"one night stand\").",

We aren't allowed to use curse words or take God's name in vain. Respect is a large thing in our house. Our parents can turn off the WiFi whenever they want. And in summer, the older kids are doing next years math lessons for school.But unlike most strict houses, my curfew is 12, but I have to tell my parents where I'm going and who I'm with and I have to have my phone at all times. I have a lot of privacy actually. I can go over to guy and girl friends houses and have them come over. And my parents don't exactly have an <b> age </b>limit on dating- then again, we're not a very sociable family so we don't worry about that a lot",

They let me wear whatever I wanted, do whatever I wanted with my hair/piercings. My parents were very laid back and in turn I respected their few rules and never really got into trouble or didn't do anything really bad. Also, they never pressured me about grades, ever. They assumed I was always doing my best and accepted that. It was a fairly stress free environment. It was nice and I loved hanging out with them.",

I can't work on homework with any male friend unless my parents are in the same room with a clear view at all times and we can't share any kind of covered space such as tables. Also that I literally have more privacy anywhere else but my home for the most part. My parents told me outright (they said this when I was 13) that it is a privilege to have privacy in my room, the bathroom, the shower, etc. my parents go through my stuff without warning any time they want to and often without reason. They do a thorough check of my entire phone and take it for weeks at a time if there is anything remotely concerning, even if I'm not the one who put it there. I had to beg to attend a dinner at IHOP with the drama department students after a musical performance that I was in even though it was only 10:30 at night and they knew most people there. And they still pretend to be the coolest parents they know.",

And the children ends up being a gangster or becomes annoying.",

Said boyfriend is not allowed to even sit on my bed, which is the only comfortable seating option in my room and as such makes it unpleasant to stay in so we go out every time we just want to hang out, which my mom doesn't like since she doesn't want me spending too much money or being out \"late\". It's a circular argument we're always having. and pretty much everything the girls said about their childhood, save the whole catholic school bit, was my childhood",

I have to wait at least 2 more years\n2. No video games, computer time, or movies during the school week. The only books I'm allowed to read are textbooks too, no fun fiction.\n3. If I get invited to a sleepover, I have to be on my very best behavior until then. If I even forget to do a chore I'm immediately not allowed to go. I've only been to 1 sleepover because of this\n4. The dating thing isn't the clearest, but I think I'm not allowed until I'm in college\n5. I naturally get good grades. If I even get a B they're going to start asking questions\n6. \"I didn't get paid to do chores around the house so neither will you\"\n7. \"If you want something, then save up for it\". The only money I get during the year is on my birthday and Christmas (maybe) and I only get an average of $30 a year b/c of this\n\n#thestruggleisreal",

As in, I'm not allowed out of the house unless its with them or for a school/church event. Only this year have I been allowed to hang out a little with my basketball team.\n2. No sleepovers! Ever!\n3. Almost died when I got a B - Mostly because all the lecturing and phone threatening probably almost killed my eardrums. That would be messy.\n4. No dating until I'm like 30. But I think they're exaggerating that a bit as I <b> age.</b>\n5. No driving until I'm 40. Also probably an exaggeration but it could be legit. Last summer I almost drove a golfcart into the same tree twice in the span of an hour...\n\nBut honestly, they're brilliant. Sure a little bit of loosening up would be great but then, they wouldn't be my parents.",

My mom was raised as a Baptist and she wasn't allowed to wear pants, it always had to be skirts. When she was in middle school, she saved her babysitting money and bought a pair of jeans. She'd leave the house every morning in a skirt, but she'd walk to her friend's house and change before and after school. She didn't get caught for like 3 years. She also wasn't allowed to go to the movies, but when she was 10 she snuck out and went to see ET, she got caught and got in big trouble.",

The list goes on, but she learned, she didn't want that for her kids, she didn't want to succofate us, so she basically told all of us you have my complete trust, y'all are good kids, and set us out into the world...The worst thing I ever did was tee-pee a house and confessed to my mom because I felt horrible, she just said she was disappointed and that she expected better from me.  We literally never got in trouble, not even when people told on us, my parents would talk it out with us, they were reasonable.\n\nObviously, we did get hit when there where extremes, but that was only when we were children, not one of us got hit by our parents after twelve...",

I never enrolled in any sports in school because of how strict my parents were, instead of it being fun for me they would turn it into a nightmare. I an 23 now and i am scared of meeting new people, i'm scared of going out with my friends to the club or bar. They took me to a strip club once and said it looked like i wasn't enjoying myself. These friend's i once pushed away are now pushing me away because they think i am a drag. The only fun i have now is video games and street racing because i can be anonymous.",

I was alone at home with my brother most of the time in the afternoon anyways when we were older. So there was <b> nobody </b>telling you what to do until in the evening. You learn how to be independent, cook for yourself, clean up, etc..\nAny my parents were the best parents ever. Once a friend from school invited me for a sleepover and I didn't want to go because she told there would be a boy who think's I'm cute and stuff. I just told my mom and she said, she won't allow it if I don't want to go there.",

Once, I wanted to wear this blouse to school that my parents thought were too low-cut. (They aren't strict with what I wear per se, it's just that they're very modest people.) So, my mom said I could wear it but only if I wear this tank top inside of it- that made me look hideous and was very uncomfortable. By the time I got to school, I couldn't take it anymore and just took it off for the rest of the day.\n\nThey also don't like it when I wear dangling earrings to school, also for modesty reasons. To this day, I still take them to school in my pocket and change them when I get there.",

I guess the most important thing about raising your kids that way is to make sure you teach them the correct names of their genitals. God forbid they were ever assaulted, the defence lawyers have tried to say \"How does she even know she was touched there? She doesn't even know what it is!\"\nThe really terrible thing is that the offenders like to put themselves in a position of power.\nThat's my fear too because as insane as it sounds, all 3 of my siblings and 1 were sexually assaulted.My older siblings are 15/16 years older than me.One by a Scout leader and the other by the brother of a babysitter. My mom was understandably paranoid after that. My younger sister and I weren't allowed to do anything like camp or have babysitters outside of family friends. I was sexually assaulted for years by my step father but I was too afraid to tell and my poor younger sister went for a sleepover with her best friend at her best friend's dad's place and my sister was. They were 12 or 13, her friend thought she'd be safe from her dad if she had friends with her. Safety in numbers.They weren't.\n Ive been through a ton of therapy so I can kind of talk about it as long as I dont go into any actual details.",

They still believe that a diploma is the key to life, and that if my mom can get straight A's while studying full time and working at night, that I should be able to do the same.\n\nNow almost 21, never partied, never been into clubs/bars, never had a sleepover.\n\nOn top of being strict, they're workaholics,  plus being an only child, equals me always alone. This resulted to me not being good at reading social cues,  can't keep life long friends, not functioning well or stresses out on things not being \"perfect\" or going the way I need it to, and lastly, I missed out a lot of experiences and opportunities on making mistakes and learning from them earlier on.\nDon't get me wrong, I love my parents, I just wish they were more open.\nRant over...",

The only way that I would be able to go out with all of my friends and stay out as late as I wanted was when I told my parents I'm sleeping over a friends house and they would only allow me to do so once in a blue moon. Because I had no freedom to go hang out with my friends I ended up cutting class, which turned into cutting a whole day so that I could go hang out with my friends during school hours. And I can totally relate to growing up with an older brother and seeing him have the freedom to do whatever he wanted go out with whoever and whenever and my parents always used the infamous reason or excuse which was either boys can't get pregnant I guess in their minds if my brother got somebody pregnant that would somehow be different then if I got pregnant and the other infamous line was when you are as <b> old </b>as your brother you can go out I learned over the years but that wasn't true lol I think being one of the two extremes (either really strict, on freedom, etc. or, like mentioned in video, like Amy poghler in meaning girls) \u00a9'&&&_--\u2014\u2014\u2030\u22059]]]]",

They were very strict about that.\n\nSo I never smoked weed, never took drugs, never slept around with guys, always took care where I went, but I d\u00edd drink at 14, (just one glass, not very impressive) because th\u00e1t was the only thing they'd forbidden me to do. \nApart from that, with all that freedom, I'm still nice and healthy.

I started to think by myself and understood that I wasn't muslim and that the fact they obligated me to pray and all was just horrible they told us non stop that we weren't like everyone that I couldn't have boy friends, boyfriends and friends that weren't muslim and I couldn't wear shorts, skirts and all so like the girl on the video I wore shirts under my skirts and would hide my skirt in my bag like my big sister. Now I have so much freedom compared to before, even if they are still strict. But there is always this psychological pression where they can't accept I'm not muslim and they are always searching proofs that god exists and it's so frustrating.\nParents should let their kids choose their religion I lived in ignorance all my life and they were just acting as if I was muslim from my birth.",

I dunno what you would call this.\nBut I asked her if I could take singing lessons this summer and she said, \"Why? How will that help your education?\" \nI'm doing just fine in school, I'm in the A honor rolls... I want to be at least decent at what I love to do y'know?

Basically as long as I didn't just go missing for a long period of time without telling her what I was up to and was mostly responsible for myself, she let me do whatever. She once opened a package of some very private things that I had ordered when I was 16 or so and just told me that she was happy I was taking charge of my sexuality, that's how cool my mum is. She wasn't always this good with some things, but I think I've helped teach her how to loosen up about stuff over the years and I'm proud of that.",

I had a 3 page (on printer paper!) list of chores every day in the summer. I wasn't allowed to watch tv unless he said it was okay, which was very rare. He was so strict and I'm still kinda messed up from it. On the opposite side of the spectrum my mom wasn't strict at all and let me do whatever I wanted. I went <b> crazy,</b> as you can imagine, and got into a lot of bad things and hung out with a lot of bad people. I'm now a single mom and I'm stronger than ever. Anyway, thank you for this because it makes me feel less alone. <3",

            "commentText": "People in the comments are talking about their experience with their parents, but just wait until you become a parent yourself. You think your parents are strict on you now, but as you grow older you'll start to realize why they did what they did and really appreciate the depth of the meaning behind it. \n\nWhy do you think Asians parents are mostly academic focused and strict towards their kids? It's so their kids can live a better life than they ever did. It's so they don't have to work in a restaurant or work in 100 degrees outside. That's why universities such as UC Berkeley and UCLA are nearly 50% Asians. Education is very important and it opens a lot of opportunities in our lives.\n\nOn the side note, <b> nobody </b>else will sacrifice as much as our parents and tell us what to do other than our parents. \n\nThe times we have with our parents now, cherish them. I'm speaking this as a 23 years<b>  old</b> son, because people really don't cherish what they have until those things around them are gone forever.  \n\nOur parents gave us everything and did their best. As they grow older, it's our turn to return the favor and protect them and look out for them. Be glad that we even have parents. Some people don't even have someone to nag to them. Please don't ever take life for granted.",

I am 13 and I feel I am capable of going to close places without guardian with me...boy am I wrong. I was told when I turn 11-12 I could go places without a guardian,yet when I ask I NEED to bring my brotger everywhere with me and it doesn't help when he says \"No,just go by yourself. there your friends\". But this does help you grow up better,believe me I guess it's getting you ready for bigger things. You can tell when someone is like \"Hey my parents don't care what I do or who my friends are\" than when a child who grew up with strict parents are like \"Hey my parents need to meet you so they know what kind of kids i'm hanging out with\" and \"Hey I have to do my homework if I want to get good grades and good grades means I can see sunlight\"\n\n\nHonestly that is what it's like for me and I hope this isn't too long or confusing \ud83d\ude0a",

I definitely feel with you there.\nI was lucky though, because if I got a bad mark once in a while (which from my high expectations is also below an A), my parents would be a little antsy, but if I explained it was a one-off thing, I was just having issues with friendships or whatever, they would kind of appreciate the honesty and say \"don't let it happen again\".\nYou probably already do this, but if you don't, communication and chatting to them 'equally' can do wonders.",

(When I did finally get a cell phone I started from the top and made it all the way to a smartphone.)

I'm not allowed dating until I'm 20 lol my parents wouldn't even let me go to a school that my older sister didn't go to, even if a bus would pick me up, they wouldn't even let me go to my school bus stop alone, even if the bus stop was  like less than a block away from my house. I barely leave my bedroom because I'm not allowed to go outside anyway, and my parents always ask me why I don't go out much... When I was like in grade 6 I had to get a therapist or counsellor, because I was a little but depressed sometimes, but I still had a fun childhood tbh, my parents could be chill sometimes. Parents are sometimes strict not because they don't trust you, but because they don't trust the world, if that makes any sense. :)",

They take out their control issues on their own children, depriving them of so many experiences, not being able to trust their own parents, having a restricted relationship with them because you have to hide parts of your life from them, feeling an incredible amount of unnecessary anxiety over miniature issues and feeling exhausted and sad when looking at some of their friends more laid back parents. It does not matter if you just \"care about your children\". Ofc most parents care about their children! It's not an excuse to take out your abnormal anxiety on your children. No child with truly strict parent ever remembers being a teenager and having an easy time. Deal with your issues, it's not a positive influence you're having on them. It's a negative one. These parents love to be strict to gain some kind of respect and status, but I'll never respect them.",

My sister's just got a new car... She's 17. My brother has had <b> sex </b>in church camp with 3 different girls in one week, I'm never aloud a boyfriend. My brother swears constantly (pretty much every other word is a swear word) I'm not even aloud to say one bad thing because I'll get grounded. I'm 14 and I have no social life, all my friends are at school only. At least when I go to my dads I can have some fun. Thanks dad",

Now, if I even turn in 1 late homework assignment or get a grade below a 70 on anything, they get super mad.\nOnly allowed out for school and work.

I had to fight with my mom for hours to add a second layer to my hair, which I am not even allowed to style (defeating the purpose of layers...)",

She refused to listen to me when I said I was wide awake, watching a YouTube video on my iPod (which wasn't a lie). This is because I do not have permission to sleep before 10:30 pm and 10am unless I am vomiting.\nI don't even have a curfew. I am only allowed out of the house every couple of months (except for school & working for them) and when I am, I have to constantly update my mother on whenever I enter or exit any building before it happens. This is because she will come pick me up whenever she feels like it. I haven't seen a friend outside school since October and haven't had a friend over my house since last April, but I'm told I see them too often. \nEven now, just a little short of 18 years <b> old,</b> my mommy has to meet my friend's mommy before I am allowed to hang out with them as if I am a child who doesn't recognize good people from bad.\nI also do way more chores than everyone I know and get called lazy (while my brother who plays video games all day and does no chores gets praised as a hard worker).\nClothing, I can't wear what I want (which is the opposite of inappropriate). I have to fight for jeans + shirts or my mom will make me wear a blouse every day. And not even a nice blouse, she wants me to dress like a 70 year<b>  old</b> accountant on a daily basis.\nI've never snuck out of the house, I do my best to obey my parents' orders (but some things they ask of me are literally impossible for any human to do), and I am always rewarded with 'you're so lazy' and 'you don't even try to be a good daughter', or, if they're really mad, 'our lives would be so much better if you were not around' and 'your rebelliousness ruins the lives of everyone around you'.",

If my sister or I didn't agree with some of the rules, we could always make our case for why the rules should change, and if we had good reasons, then they'd modify the rules. Although, there would be times that other kids were allowed to do certain things that we weren't allowed to do. One thing is they would always get too bent out of shape if we wrote on ourselves with pen or markers. They have a passionate disdain for tattoos, which lingers with me. It causes me difficulties because many of my friends have tattoos, and it's awkward for me when they talk about tattoos. They also tended to overreact if we had <b> gay<b> /</b</b>>bisexual friends or they suspected us of bein<b> g g<b> a</b</b>>y. Thankfully I've been able to mostly overcome that prejudice.",

Every day it is: school, bus drops me off in front of family business (not allowed to work anywhere else), then home. Curfew would imply that I am let out of my parents' sight outside of school. I don't even have a curfew for the handful of times per year I am allowed out of the house because when I am, I need to update my parents every time I enter or exit a building and my parents will just come pick me up whenever they feel like it.\nI have a handful of guy friends too, but I wasn't even allowed to invite<b>  ga<b> y</b</b>> guys to my birthday party last year (even when I said they would have to leave by 6). I don't talk about my guy friends, though because they always talk crap about them, almost like they can convince me to stop being friends with them.",
