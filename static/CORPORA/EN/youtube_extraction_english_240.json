        "postText": " As Bangladesh marks 40 years of independence, BBC Asian Network has been looking at the the links between the UK and the country.. . More than 90% of British Bangladeshis comes from the region of Sylhet in the north-east of the country - and remittances pour into the economy there from migrants who live in the UK.. . One way in which British Bangladeshis try to hold on to their links is by sending their British-born children to school there.. . Pupils are taught the British curriculum and children born in the UK are dotted among those in the classroom. ",

I actually have tears, why would parents give birth and then separate themselves from their kids in the name of better upbringing? This is their job, but if you really want the Bangladeshi culture then really as a family they should have all gone together. No this is not right, even when I go for a few weeks I can tell you its not easy to live there when you go from London, the longest Ive stayed is 8months just wanted Bangladeshi lifestyle, and I can tell you I got a once in a lifetime lesson, never again. Its sad because I do like Bangladesh. Poor boys I will pray for you guys tonight, I have children and the pain I felt in your words too real.",

Would like to see a recent video of them talking about their experiences themselves without a reporter or anyone asking and promoting them guided questions. I wonder if they are in Bangladesh or if they are here. Would like to know how they adjusted to living somewhere different. It is interesting. And whatever reasons there were for them to be in a school far away - I hope the experiences were not too terrible for them. The video shows the date a few years back so I'm sure they have finished school now (2016 now) I hope they see my comment. Perhaps they will reply.",

I got a car \ud83d\ude97 with clean drivers license and I got no criminal record  either, I'm doing my best to get into university but it ain't cheap I'm not getting a student loan ...  the message is this to anyone reading or thinking of trying to insult me - I'm doing a lot better in uk \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 then I did in Bangladesh \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\udde9, I love every minute of this free country , I know I said some mad stuff (political stuff on the video ) but I was only 14 at the time people make mistakes when they are young that's what life is from the beginning to the end tombstone we all make bad choices and good choices the best thing to do is learn from our mistakes and repair ourselves . Those men that gave me a hard time in the school were practically hating on a rich foreigner kid like me , I uploaded a pic on my fb acc with a afghan guy injecting needle into his forearm . A lot of the men that gave me a hard time wish I was like that in real life (heroin addict )but that ain't the case so suck on deez nut \ud83e\udd5c to all my haters out there .",

At least Christmas is fixed 2 weeks holidays and its fixed every 25th December. The reason y I like Christmas is because I had God parents growing up . The people that know my family in Bournemouth know very well who my gods  parents are . Ps thanks Jackie and David for all the lovely animal hoodies and ps2 games that you gave to me and my family plus we love your chocolate cake \ud83c\udf70 that u would always bake for us before visiting us at Dorset . All the best fahim Ali . I hope your daughter Claire is alright after she looked after my 3 sister and brother while my parents took my little sister and me to Morocco \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\udde6 for 2 weeks back at 2006 ...",
