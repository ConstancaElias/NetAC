            "commentText": "The medical profession is a scam.  Think about it.  \n\nEvery year of my life, and I'm almost 50, the taxpayers of the USA have spent over $1 billion dollars to research a cure for cancer.  And that fails to include all the money raised by these so-called cancer charities as well as various State government taxpayer fleecing operations.  \n\nSo fast forward to when I was 27 and the <b> doctors </b>told me I had cancer.  Yes, at 27.  Uncommon but not unheard of.  Just ask Dirk Benedict.\n\nSo they prescribed me a certain toxic synthetic drug, which I never got filled, and I went to two other specialists who gave me the same exact course of action including that same prescription which I never got filled.  \n\nTo be clear, they prescribed me with let's just call it drug C.  I was supposed to take it until the prescription ran out.  If I was still having problems, I would be prescribed drug B and rinse and repeat.  If I was still having problems I was supposed to be prescribed drug A and rinse and repeat.  If I was still having problems I was supposed to be immediately scheduled for surgery.  \n\nThen I started doing some research on cancer and found out that there are hundreds of thousands  of people who are living today (this was 1997) precisely because they learned to heal themselves and to refuse to listen to the invasive surgical and toxic synthetic drug advice that so called<b>  Doctors</b> like to peddle.  \n\nLong story short.  I learned how to heal myself naturally and never went back to see those scammin<b> g doctor</b>s again until about a year later when I had them give me a seal of approval for being cancer free.  That experience gave me a completely different perspective than the malarkey th<b> at Docto</b>rs are professionals and that they are educated.",

Also, going to a 4 year, plus dental school, plus buying into a dental practice (or starting your own) gets me easily to over 1 mil in debt.  WTF? Also, guess what loan you cant declare bankruptcy on!!!??  Fucking school loans.  As I literally am now working two jobs, since being a fucking doctor wasnt paying the loans and bills, I really despise any person that is milking the system.  Apparently working hard and attempting to achieve the best fiscally responsible profession for my family's well-being, is no longer enough and I was fucking lied to by the boomers out there.
