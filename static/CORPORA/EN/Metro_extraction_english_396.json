        "postText": "Piers Morgan has revealed that he\u2019ll be debating whether or not he should be fired from Good Morning Britain on tomorrow\u2019s show.', 'The controversial presenter, who co-hosts the ITV daytime programme alongside Susanna Reid, announced the upcoming segment following the news that angry viewers have started a petition to get him removed from the series.', 'Confirming the topic of discussion with his 6.8million followers on Twitter, Piers wrote: \u2018UPDATE: On tomorrow\u2019s @GMB, we will be debating whether I should be fired.\u2019', 'He also disclosed that his Good Morning Britain contract runs out on New Year\u2019s Eve.', 'So far over 7,758 people have signed a Change.org campaign calling for Piers to be sacked from the show.', '\u2018Morgan dictates to his viewers that it\u2019s acceptable to deny an LGBTQ+ person of their rights; it\u2019s acceptable to tell them they don\u2019t exist; it\u2019s acceptable to call them \u201csnowflakes\u201d when they get rightfully upset,\u2019 part of the petition\u2019s description reads.', '\u2018These are the lessons Morgan teaches. ITV, as a major broadcasting corporation with a worldwide reach, are currently tarnishing a long-lasting legacy by using one of their highest-performing programmes as a vehicle to spread hate and intolerance.\u2019', 'It goes on to add: \u2018I understand that viewers are important, numbers mean business and high engagement suggests success, but are there really no other ways to achieve it?', '\u2018Despite Good Morning Britain\u2019s current performance, to be conscious of a majority of their viewership being sexist, racist, transphobic, and generally unwilling to accept minorities or viewpoints aside from their own is repulsive, for lack of a better term\u2026', '\u2018Wake up to the reality of Morgan\u2019s behaviour. Hate crimes are on the rise, transphobia and discrimination over gender identity is becoming commonplace both upon social media and in the real world, and ITV continue to sit idly and let it play out in the name of entertainment.', '\u2018It should be obvious by now that this has far surpassed an acceptable threshold, with Morgan\u2019s rhetoric and actions sitting firmly in dangerous territory.\u2019",

So how do we fix this considering the man is on a commercial channel so not bound to the same rigid rules of a public broadcaster? Also my suggestion of switching over is in fact the only way you'd get this guy off tv,it really is all about ratings.Can I also point out that the petition wether you believe in it or not is pointless because it's asking for 25,000 signatures, which when calculated against the average viewing figures (approx 700,000) equates to about 3.5% of their viewership. The reason why I bring this up is because I noticed that according to you anyone who supports him or doesn't have a problem with him is a fascist,however I must point out that imposing the ideals of a small minority (3.5%) on the majority is in itself fascism. Also just to clarify, I'm not a supporter or viewer of his shows but then again I don't have a problem with the guy and wouldn't necessarily switch over if he came on a show I was watching but I don't watch his shows. I do however support his right to have an opinion.",
