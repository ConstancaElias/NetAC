        "postText": "Jewish people don\u2019t feel the UK is a safe place to bring up their children and some are already planning to leave, former chief rabbi Jonathan Sacks has said.', 'Lord Sacks, a crossbench peer, says British jews are considering leaving the country if Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn ever becomes Prime Minister.', 'Corbyn must \u2018recant and repent\u2019 over his remarks on Zionism, Lord Sacks said, or he risked engulfing the UK \u2018in the flames of hatred\u2019.', 'Jewish families fear the Labour leader could unleash \u2018a new wave of anti-Semitism\u2019, the rabbi warned.', 'He told BBC1\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u2018When people hear the kind of language that has been coming out of Labour, that\u2019s been brought to the surface among Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s earlier speeches, they cannot but feel an existential threat.\u2019', 'He added: \u2018Jews have been in Britain since 1656, I know of no other occasion in these 362 years when Jews \u2013 the majority of our community \u2013 are asking \u201cis this country safe to bring up our children\u201d.', '\u2018Now, this is very, very worrying.', '\u2018Anyone who uses the term Zionist loosely, without great care, is in danger of engulfing Britain in the kind of flames of hatred that have reappeared throughout Europe, and is massively irresponsible.', '\u2018There is danger that Jeremy Corbyn may one day be prime minister, he is the leader of Her Majesty\u2019s opposition, and I\u2019m afraid that until he expresses clear remorse for what he has said and what his party has done to its Jewish sympathisers as well as its Jewish MPs, then he is as great a danger as Enoch Powell was.\u2019', 'Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said comparisons between Corbyn and Enoch Powell were \u2018just wrong\u2019.', 'He told the BBC: \u2018Jeremy has made it absolutely clear we will protect Jewish members of our party from any form of abuse and anti-Semitism.', '\u2018I just say to Lord Sacks \u201cyou\u2019ve got it wrong, come and talk to us\u201d.\u2019', 'Labour\u2019s ruling National Executive Committee will meet this week to decide whether or not to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism in full.', 'This weekend, Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown told a Jewish Labour Movement conference that the definition must be adopted \u2018unanimously, unequivocally and immediately.\u2019', 'Mr McDonnell said: \u2018I think all sides will be satisfied with the proposals that will be discussed.', '\u2018I think acceptance overall, and I think also the commitment to freedom of speech, and yes, a recognition of the rights of Palestinians.', '\u2018From what I\u2019ve heard, it will be resolved, and there will be a balance about acceptance, as people want, but also, exactly about what others have said as well \u2013 Lord Sacks himself \u2013 that freedom of speech is important as well.', '\u2018The ability to criticise policies that you disagree with, but you do it in terms which are acceptable.\u2019', 'Mr McDonnell said he wanted Frank Field to \u2018come back into the fold\u2019 after resigning the Labour whip over the anti-Semitism row.', 'It comes as senior Labour figure Dame Margaret Hodge launched a fresh attack on Corbyn, claiming the leadership has a \u2018hatred of Jews\u2019.', 'The former minister told the Sunday Times: \u2018All (the leadership) can think about is their internal Labour party and their hatred of Jews.', '\u2018Jeremy has allowed anti-Semitism and racism to run rife. He needs to renounce much of what he did.\u2019",

He will never be the PM and so it is much better for Jewish people to stay than go. Just because he goes to pro-Hamas and pro-Hizbollah gatherings just means that he is deluded and is a grade one dipstick. Stay and carry on being productive members of society as you always have. He will be on his way out soon enough along with Momentum. Remember the mess that Micheal Foot and the Militant Tendency made of things well he is just a better dressed Micheal Foot but just the same nevertheless.",
