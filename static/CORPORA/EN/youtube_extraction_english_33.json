Not all American men the same.  Not all\nAmerican women are the same. There is a smaller faction of American women who long for a more traditional\nhome and family life.  But they are anxious to speak out about it because pissed off feminists like you all would\nfind them and punish them.  That is a liberal feminist for ya.....It is OUR WAY or else.....How interesting.....\nand oh so tolerant too.....",

The man went out and worked to support his family the wife stayed home took care of the house and raise the kids. When the guy was not working he took out the trash fix the toilets cut the lawn fix the car and anything else need to be done like paint the house change the oil to the car. The wife is expected to cook clean do laundry. But none of you would understand a partnership. Truthfully in this day and <b> age </b>and probably just past 30 years maybe even 40 it's taken both the man and the<b>  woman</b> to make ends meet so the Dynamic has changed. I forgot to mention kids were expected to work to they had chores to do. And I'm not talking about growing up on a farm or Ranch. When you have the reading skills of a 5th Grader from the mid-fifties graduating college there's something wrong. Poor work ethics. Me first attitude. And a strong compensatory not to tell the truth more or less poor morality. it's a shame people produce this crap as some form of the truth without even knowing or understanding their own past. Instead promote more divisiveness. What a shame.",

That one's indefensible)\n\nSecond of all, is Rihana being \"used\" or being \"worshipped\" by all those men? Food for thought.\n\nThird of all, take a close look at the father figure in most modern ads and television shows. Notice... the father is always a dumshit that can't do anything right, and the <b> woman </b>is the gracious, beautiful, elegantly condescending and wise problem-solver that keeps the family from plunging into chaos (presumably because of the actions of the stupid fuckface she married).\n\nSo who REALLY gets the short end of the<b>  sexism</b> stick: \n1. The underdeveloped maternal character (Marge Simpson, Lois Griffin, Francine Smith, Wilma Flintstone, Jane Jetson, Sharon Marsh, Cheryl David, Donna Tubbs OR Loretta Brown)\nor 2. the disrespected male character (Homer Simpson, Peter Griffin, Stan Smith, Fred Flinstone, George Jetson, Stan Marsh, Larry David, Cleveland Brown)?<b> \n\nNobod</b>y has any problem with depicting head of household males as barely functioning adults with a flare for epic failure and embarrassment... but the corresponding women are hermetically sealed from all humiliation.\n\nFemale characters are kept in a safe little box in which they have trouble contributing to an episodic plot without riski<b> ng sexi</b>sm accusations. You have feminism to thank for badly written female characters, because it's hard to have a great character if the character is not allowed to fail in any meaningful way. You can't move the plot along in an episode without the setup... which always involves a catastrophic (usually boneheaded) derailment of everyone's plans.",

They did no \"amazing thing\" for a good reason or as a sacrifice. It was all for their selfish gain.

There is historical precident for the opposite, first computer was programmed by a <b> woman </b>in the 1840s (ada Lovelace) but this went largely unrecognized. As you can see women were considered as only good for looking good and doing chores in these vintage ads (probably from the 50s based on hair and clothing in the ads) even after many years of female inventors and innovators. \nSaying \"they were brought up that way\" doesn't excuse anything anyway. \nWe appear to have made progress in the western world. But these sexist attitudes still exist, there are still women being told they are worthless because they are women. There is still more pressure on women to always be beautiful and<b>  thin</b> and sexy than there is on men. Look at the end of the video where they show the ad for the unisex shirt. The pic of the guy is a guy standing there with the shirt buttoned up. The pic of th<b> e woma</b>n looks like something out of porn. This sends the message that guys can be casual and it's fine to look normal but women have to always be sexy. This <b> is sexi</b>sm! \nAlso let's ignore that in countries like Iran i<b> f a wo</b>man takes off her head scarf she can be arrested, or countries like Saudi Arabia where women are only now (since June this year) allowed to drive cars.",

I've been thinking about it a lot. Why do people call men who like to do things like dance ballet, drink fruity drinks, talk about their feelings, wear the color pink, avoid physical fights, wear skirts or heels etc. as being girly? Why do they use girly as an insult? Because for centuries, at least in western countries, being girly meant being feminine which meant being weaker which meant being inferior to manly qualities. It seems that eve<b> n sexis</b>m against males mainly stem fr<b> om sexi</b>sm against females. It all leads back to viewing feminine qualities as the standard for being weak. If we can change this mentality against women then I think it would, as a result, change the mentality of what it is to be a man as  well. Standing up<b>  to sex</b>ism against women would actually be beneficial for both sexes (& those in-between) in the end.",

                    "commentText": "lala Chan You're absolutely right, and its not just your country......Most cultures deem masculinity as superior, and this is REALLY harmful and prejudiced to both sexes. I apologize in advance for this annoyingly long comment: No single human being is only \"masculine\" or only \"feminine.\" Men and Women are complex, because we are human beings that are \"worth\" equally: humans have depth and complexity. Men and Women are NOT the same, but that doesn't mean one is better than the other nor does it mean one cannot do the job generally attributed to the other. Society generally attributes leadership, engineering and mechanics with men because occupations pertaining to these areas are attributed with traditional \"masculine\" traits (logical, analytical etc) but it doesnt mean women can't do these just as well. we do have female leaders that proved themselves capable. Just because youre a <b> woman </b>doesnt mean you arent capable of logic and analysis: you can have those traits at the SAME time as kindness and welcoming (which are traditionally \"feminine\" traits). Same goes with men: childcaring and humanitarianism is often associated as being feminine because of its association with traits like kindness and nurturing but it doesnt mean men can't excel in these fields either. Men can be compassionate and gentle while having other traditionally masculine traits. More muscle mass (physical strength) and being able to give birth are UNIQUE traits that are given to men and women respectively, and I don't think one is necessarily \"better\" than the other. The idea that one trait is \"above\" the other is extremely harmful to both men and women. I'm sorry again for writing such a long comment, I'm just happy to see someone else seeing what is really going on.",

The reality is that people will discriminate against anyone who doesn't act like the majority of a group. Men who act like females are discriminated not because of \"<b> sexism </b>against females,\" but rather because they go against the norms of most males. Here's some proof that debunks your entire argument: why are females who act like males discriminated against then? Girls who are tomboys, dress in male clothes, get short haircuts, are called lesbos, weirdos and discriminated against just as much as males acting like females. The truth is as much as you'd love for<b>  sexism</b> to only be about women<b> , sexis</b>m against males does exist and it's not rooted in fema<b> le sexi</b>sm.

            "commentText": "Guess what? That's called business... Ad companies aren't moral, just like the news companies (aka buzzfeed). They do what sells. Is it okay that \"Everything's <b> racist </b>and sexist but we won't try to fix it and will only tell you the issue\"? The ads make money and that's what matters. This isn't cultural Marxism and social equality does not matter. Equality = Legal rights you have as a citizen, you can't infringe on other people's rights to free speech no matter how deluded that free speech is. look at ISIS, look at the KKK, the westboro baptist church... You do NOT have the right to not get offended. You have the right to get offended. Be lucky you have that. In the words of Noam Chomsky: \"If you're in favor of free speech, then you're in favor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise. Otherwise, you're not in favor of free speech,\"  but i digress, the purpose of the ads were not to stir controversy and deem women 'incapable' but rather was just to sell products and make money. You cannot blame the ad companies, you can blame all of society, including you.",

I can count how many times I've seen and add that portrays men as bumbling idiot and women as the saviors, men as bad fathers, terrible hygienist, and just downright irking creatures and women as good suffering mothers who have to put up with a man's foolishness.\n\nI'm just wondering. Watching this channel you would think only women had problems in the world. But the rising statistics of suicide amongst men tells you otherwise. There are things in our society that are not being discussed. I blame the one sided feminist.",

Where in the video did they state that no one is sexist towards men?\n\nAnd if you think <b> sexism </b>doesn't exist today, watch until the end of the video.<b>  Sexism</b> still exists, and even women are sexist towards women and men. Look at school dress coded, salary differences, the fact that men can be topless in public, but women can't. Look at sports, and the fact that at my school the only sports that both genders can do are cross country and track. If a girl wants to do football, too bad. If a boy wants to do volleyball, too bad. Not all men are sexist, and not everyone who's sexist is a man. This video was just pointing out cases of people being sexist towards women. \n\nAlso I get that feminism has gotten a little extreme, with women freaking out every time women are associated with pink or makeup (I honestly don't care if someone thinks of a pink bedroom as a girls bedroom. I actually like the color pink.) but look at the actual definition of feminism. Feminism is wanting women to have EQUAL rights as men, so if you are against feminism, you are against equal rights. And that makes you sexist. So let that sink in.",

So, unless I am hoping to attract a silverback gorilla or a wolf companion, it's not really a priority. Also, I am aware enough of my own inner workings to not play into that whole 'subconcious' theatre that pseudo-psychologists such as yourself like to banter around. I simply do not like children and/or human companionship. Mostly, I find being around other people for too long to be annoying, as most are petty and overly self-involved. But nice work trying to judge a complete stranger based upon a statement that does not affect your life in the least. :)",

Cleaning was, and still is to some degree, traditionally a woman's \"job\". The ad isn't implying that it's the only thing women are good for; it's implying that it's a product that is relevant for a woman's job at that time (1968) - it's their client base. I also guess that most women don't clean their house for men, but do it because it's nice to be clean, and they want to be proud of their homes.\nMy mom is interested in cleaning products and she is the only person that buys them in their household. It wouldn't make sense in that household for ads to target my dad for cleaning products, as he wouldn't buy it unless absolutely necessary.",

It's just food, be confident and do you, think about yourself and not people who you will forget about once you have done something with your life! Remember, one day you'll be doing something amazing, be married have kids (if you want to anyway) and you will eat all the bananas without anyone getting to you :D",

I saw that a few men in the room were giving me such \"<b> WEIRD\"</b> looks that i threw away my lollipop in shame (and mind you i NEVER throw away food because i hate wasting it). And the worst thing was, the majority of them weren't even immature boys rather the male staff of my school! I can't even explain how i felt ..and felt as if it was somehow my fault even though it was just their dirty mind sets.\nAnd just to remind you, i was a 16 YEAR<b>  OLD</b> GIRL while they were MY TEACHERS AND MALE SCHOOL STAFF IN THEIR 30s. You can't even blame it on \"immaturity\" because that was CLEARLY \"something else\".",

I feel self conscious when I have to drink through a straw/eat an icelolly, talk about sausages etc. so much is sexualised. There are so few things women can do without being sexualised and our privacy/personal space invaded. These are feminist perspectives. Feminism is not about bringing equality to both genders necessarily, it's recognising inequality between genders more so. Equality to both genders and all people is called Egalitarianism. These definitions are being messed about but these are the proper definitions. There are now different types of feminism and having feminist perspectives is not a bad thing whether you want to call yourself one or not it doesn't matter, it's just a word & many claim to be one when they aren't.",

You can't seriously argue that <b> sexism </b>is a 'white male' issue, and then DIRECTLY SAY that white men are the only conservative extremists in the world, in response I would like to point out that<b>  sexism</b> is not discriminatory t<b> o rac</b>e, and th<b> at bla</b>ck men can also hit women. That Buzzfeed, who has on multiple occasions spoken about bigotry in mainstream culture, starts their video<b>  on sex</b>ism with a bigoted statement, that in no way reflects reality and can't be backed up by facts and data. It is saddening to think that this is what the modern progressive movement is. I think of myself as a progressive, and I do think that there is still inequality in the western world a<b> bout ge</b>nder, but I also care about facts, statistics and data. Presenting bigoted opinions as facts is not the right way to sell the progressive movement in the western (educated) world, outsiders will look at video's like these, and stereotype the left wingers as being just as laughably STUPID based on the information (or non-info) that is presented in this video. One by one I could go down the list of mis-information that is happening in this video, but we live in a time where google excists. Look up facts, data and statistics to view the reality of society, and do not make assumptions based on your interpretation of the world around you. Also it would be good for buzzfeed to not have an echo chamber of people who agree with each other, it is pointless to hear 10 people echo each others opinions around, although based on youtube analytics I think that their audience might be looking to hear their own opinion echo in order to affirm their self righteousness, and that is an opinion based on facts and statistics. To close off, Buzzfeed needs to understand that in this video there was a feeling of arrogance spread troughout this video, and the message 'look how much better we are then them' was very prominent.",

The underlying fact is that men have thought of themselves superior throughout history; this still reflects in today's society.  The point is we do not see <b> sexism </b>so prominent in today's culture, but it is still there. For example women over 65 are 50 percent more likely to live in poverty as shown in a study by NPR. Due to the wage gap, many people are suffering. It may not be you, but the wage gap has made some people's lives horrible and impacted their hopefully stable<b>  mental</b> state.",

He's let me and my sister know it, he's a product of the 1950s (so he most likely grew up with several of these ads) loud(mouthed) and proud.\nIf my sister and I were much younger looking at these ads, we'd probably laugh at a few of these, because when we were really little and didn't know any better, my dad would joke about this kinda stuff and make it look funny, so since he looked funny, we thought the \"humor\" was funny, so we laughed.  It wasn't until we were a bit older that we realized he was trying to teach us to be misogynistic, against our own <b> gender.</b>\nOne thing he likes to say is that if we don't \"shape up\" in the ways he thinks we should, then one day we'll be <b> \"old</b> maids.\"  He said if we don't have husbands by about our thirties, like in one of these ads, we'll end u<b> p ol</b>d maids.  Like it's supposed to be shamed and shunned for not getting married while you're young...?  Why can't people just leave things alone, let people find love whenever they do, and let them live in peace?  I don't know if I have a mate in my future yet, but if I do, I'll find him on my own time.  That ad really struck a cord with me.\nI also have had a few bad boyfriends in the past, so naturally my dad loved them.  When one of them and I broke up, I felt so free, but my dad started yelling at me, saying that the reason the guy broke up with me (even though it was mutual) was because I didn't get myself fixed up all pretty, like on the night of my junior prom, when the guy was my date.  I've had my dad and a few other guys (though admittedly not many, thank God) who have said that appearances are everything, that and doing as you're told, by them.  Disgusting.",

I don't want society to reverse to the prudish thing it was back then, I think we advanced a lot as people, but it is still kinda <b> weird.</b> Like I saw a comparison the other day of ads for socks. The man ones were just socks and hairy legs not even showing their face. The female ones had a smiling<b>  woman</b> i<b> n weir</b>d positions touching their bodies. The ads were from the same company. It is n<b> ot wei</b>rd when it's both people i<b> n a sex</b>ual situation. I<b> t IS w</b>eird when it is only one of them",

That belief came from a study that showed if you add all men's earnings and all women's earnings, men bring in more. People see that and assume women aren't getting paid less, but they don't insert that possibilities of different jobs and work hours. And you should probably actually look up the legal superiority women have over men. I already gave a pretty decent list. Name 1 right men have that women don't. Women get harassed, yeah that happens to everyone regardless of <b> gender.</b> Women get talked down to. Look how so many women treat little boys. Telling them they're all worthless and just going to grow up to be rapists. Women don't have any exclusive problems. Men face all those same problems and don't get any recognition. Don't claim to be researched. Feminist sites that push an agenda aren't good for research. They simply state opinions and claim them as facts",

If you're referring to the 50's ads, a lot of those things were under the influence of society's views - things that not just men, but WOMEN as well, thought to be true because that's the system which they were raised in. \nThe modern ads, though not shown here, the bias is seen on each side. Women are seen as <b> sexual </b>objects, of course, but so are men. Impossible body standards, underwear commercials and photoshopped ads to make men seem more \"appealing\" to everyone that sees them.\nI just don't think it's fair to say you hate men if the basis for your statement is incredibly biased.",

They may not be bleeding and giving birth but nowadays they are getting a bad rep just because men before them have been sexist. I used to have the same mentality that boys hated girls but later on I really didn't think of it that way.

That is why I say we haven't come very far. A lot of people still don't take these complaints seriously. But it is also completely unfair that men aren't given the same support, the same ability to cause an uproar, that their voice is silenced because they are just supposed to \"take it like a man\" whatever that even means. Over sexualization is rampant in both genders and we do need way more support for men and just more media support in general.

How do you expect her to grow up knowing her worth when there are ads after ads in her face practically yelling \"hey look at this. This is what men want. This is all you're good for\" ? Not to mention there have been many social studies done showing how portrayal of advertisements', commercials, and magazines have a direct impact on a female's self esteem and even their own identity. Go watch a documentary. Have you ever heard of the documentary \"Sexy Baby\"? You really should if you really don't think that this misrepresentation of women affects young girls because it quite literally documents this very scenario. \"Miss-interpretation\" is another that very clearly makes this point. There is plenty of evidence all around you, open your eyes.",

He just said that these particular women don't know something.\n\nSaying someone about one <b> woman </b>isn't the same as saying something about all women. Stop being like an ant, or a drone. You're not a hivemind collective. I can say that one<b>  woman</b> is a complete idiot without saying all women are. \n\nBut it's so like feminists to do this. EVERY time you say something against a feminist, she calls you <b> a misogynis</b>t. Why? You only said something about her. Not something about all women. However, feminsts have really nutured the sense in the female feminists that they're all a collective, like drones. They're meant to look at a<b> ny wom</b>an in a game or movie and think what's happening to that character is happening to them as well.\n\nThink about the next time someone says something negative so a single individual, and someone says \"you hate all group that individual belongs to\".

You said a few women started wars but the number of men in power who start fights and wars far outnumbers the women who do because not many women were allowed to hold positions of power back in the past. Women who gain power basically slept their way to power and the man who was in power happened to die and now the pendulum swings to her side. It was seen that men were more of the aggressors and physically they were stronger than women so that is why it played out that women were the subservient, submissive, and docile creatures and of course you wouldn't send them into war until recently.\u00a0 Even if they stayed behind from war, they were often raped or killed during times of war. They were passed around to sexually serve the opposing side. Of course, I would want to stay at home with the children instead of fight a war; however, a life of servitude where you aren't allow to stray from the path set before you kind of sucks. All a woman's worth back then was to cook, clean, and birth children she couldn't have any goals and if she did she would have to sleep her way there. These stereotypical views have shaped the various inequalities that both genders have to endure.",

There are many males who are shot half naked or portrayed in an objectified, sexualized way. It happens way more often with females in general, though. What I dislike is when some females rejoice in a male being sexually harassed because now he knows how they feel. Maybe if that man was a molester it would be fair, but he probably had <b> nothing </b>to do with female oppression. Same thing when some<b>  black</b> people celebrate and find it fitting when bad things happen to white people because they feel white people oppressed them. Those specific white people probably never did anything wrong to <b> a blac</b>k person due to the<b> ir ra</b>ce and it is possible that their ancestors were oppressed by the same people that oppressed <b> the bl</b>ack people's ancestors.",

                    "commentText": "+TheCreeperDownStairs To be honest I'm a <b> woman </b>but even I don't think we should so easily be trained for combat and sent out to war.<b>  Woman</b> are just too much weaker than despite getting the same amount of training. Women are DANGEROUSLY weaker, slower, less fit... \n\nA study was taken where two groups of trainees were observed: an all male team, and he female integration team(which would have had a fair amount of women though less than men. let's say it was about 15-30% female). the study observed that team A(all male) proved to be a better team. They found the running easier, carrying the heavy weights easier and were generally slicker with less error. Team B's disadvantages became very apparent during the exercise the team was slowed down and weaker. The study noted that in the wall climbing excercise for example the women needed help throwing their bags over the wall so they could make the climb easily - they needed help in some aspect of the training. \n\nYou might ask what this all means, here it is: the war zone is a very dangerous place to be. Teamwork is imperative and if anyone slips up or falls behind in physical straining the whole team is at risk when aiding these people it might even cost an entire team of soldiers their LIFE! It's like trying to take a knife to gun fight or how the saying goes.\n\nwhen a tran<b> s woma</b>n was allowed to continue her boxing career with other women she absolutely destroyed every opponent and admitted testosterone was definitely a force to be regarded. If I remember correctly she was getting female hormones and had had the surgery being almost completely female now she was beating the elites with pure testosterone. \n\nI believe that women on the very elitist and strongest can actually join the army or carnage will ensue.\n\nAnother point you brought up about women being better distance runners I have heard something along those lines about bigger gluteous maximi , which is often a trait attributed to women, helping to extend running time and since you are yet to bring up an actual study you have read I will fight your argument assuming it is about a natural ability women have over men despite testosterone. I believe you been misinformed or twisted the truth. If you go out on the internet you can find anything you're actively looking for like 'do injections cause autism' and ma<b> ny o</b>ld studies that say they do but if you don't actively look for 'injections don't cause autism you won't anything. it's a bit like the wage gap feminist always bring up. if they are always actively looking for studies that show it's real then they won't find the studies that prove that it's fake and made up. so in the same way I suppose you have played a little game of Chinese whispers. somehow you may have found a study that women are better long-distance runners than men but in reality that study has probably not factored in a lot of things I can think of many fads I've seen on the Internet like the Venus work out which supposedly proves it can just lose weight when do<b> ing noth</b>ing so doing special stretches will aid them or again with the gluteus maximus study the I read said that back when humans were Hunters then their butt muscles  would help balance them as they run long distances but I can turn that around so that the study says that if you have an enlarged gluteus maximus li<b> ke a w</b>oman you can be a better distance runner which is not what the original survey said or how the wage gap survey originally said that women make less than men but considered choices in career and work ethic which feminist and social justice Warriors miss out to forward their agenda.\n\n\nSo in the end which is better for the people.",

That shows how little you actually understand about how the world worked back then, but that's fine. No, most men fighting were forced to fight. They were drafted like Hali said. \n\nWomen stayed home mostly, but do you really think so many of them were eager to risk their lives? What's really the biggest problem. Being forced to stay home from a war.. or being forced into the war against your will? I don't think the two problems are actually comparable. It doesn't really compare, and thus there's no point in adding that. All it does is make it sound like some person could actually think that being forced to stay home is \"oppression\" and thus worse than being drafted.\n\nFrom what I know, the draft was the payment men paid to get the right to vote. Women got the vote later than men, but the striking difference is that they didn't have to pay the toll of potentially being drafted.\n\nLike AllGuts said, Women were nurses. There were also <b> woman </b>pilots.",

That isn't excusing the actions of other races. That one comment was just focusing on a specific, and more often or not the most problematic of the groups. Also, though men as a whole still held a great deal of power in the 1950s, <b> race </b>obviously held minorities back. I cant think of many men from this time that are minorities that would willingly go back to a period where they will be stripped of their rights.\u00a0\n\nBuzzfeed is not a historical nor is it always fact based. This is not going to be 100% accurate 100% of the time. It was one small comment on a video that isn't even 4 minutes long, it is really not that serious.\u00a0\n\nAlso why must they be bimbos? Was that comment actually necessary?\u00a0\n\nNo one said only white men did anything. Its just that white men, who made the ads in the video, were focused on.\u00a0\n\nAlso you said you 'would be offended'. I cant tell if that is a typo or if you were speaking hypothetically. If you suffered any abuse I am happy that you survived and persevered but this video isnt about<b>  sexism</b> in general. Its about ads. Ads that were made by white men because they were the only ones allowed in those types of jobs. It REALLY isn't that serious.",

Trying to ignore these differences is an enormous fallacy, we should embrace them. While I don't think it would help our society, if a <b> woman </b>wanted to be really submissive or stay at home cleaning, they should be allowed to. NOT forced to. Getting these rights movements are not to force people not to follow their stereotypes, its to let them do whatever they want. If I had a wife who wanted to go to business school and get economic job, I'd say go for it, if she wanted to be a house wife, I'd say go for it. What bugs me is when people try to be genderblind, because what we need to be is gendertolerant and genderaccepting.",

Why do you think Women are still considered only half a person in court in some countries? Why do you think women are still being raped because they said 'no', or just existed on a local bus? Why do you think men are being raped in the same situations? Why? Because feminism's job is not finished yet, we still have so so much to go. and fwi, feminism translates to equality, so basically what you just said was \"so i don't see the point of equality\".

Reading back on my post I really didn't go into that ;/. I still think that, separate to developing countries where women are oppressed, men and women are still not really equal. Women don't seem to be going for STEM or similar careers but I guess at the same time men are often criticised for going into more creative careers (textiles, drama, art etc.), which is just as wrong. Again I am really sorry if I offended you - you do have a\u00a0really valid point.\n\nps - Look up Malala Yousafzai - she worded this sort of thing really well and doesn't describe herself as feminist.\n\nThank you for 'putting me straight' as it seems - I wasn't really looking at the bigger picture :)",

Another Queen who rebelled against Rome was Zenobia of Palmyra. Like Boudicca, she was defeated, but unlike Boudicca was allowed to live. \n\nAefelflaed, the 'Lady of the Mercians' daughter of Alfred the Great of Wessex, fought against the Danes, with her husband the King of Mercia, and after his death led the army herself, and eventually died in battle fighting them. \n\nMatilda of Tuscany fought against the Austrian Emperor in support of the Pope. She governed a large part of Italy in her own right, and was a major military leader. \n\nJoan of Arc did not start a war, she participated in one. The Hundred Years War had been going on for - well, nearly a hundred years, by the time she entered it.

Women aren't inferior or second class, but they are not(on average)as physically capable as men. That's fact.\u00a0Are there some amazing female athletes? Absolutely, but they will never be\u00a0as capable as the most athletic\u00a0men. Women(on average)\u00a0are far more physically appealing than men. Even straight women find other women beautiful.The features that naturally give men an athletic advantage in men make them far less attractive by\u00a0comparison of the feminine form. \u00a0That's just nature. I know you weren't attacking me or being rude, so I hope my comment isn't taken that way.",

So why would you choose to identify as feminist if you want both genders to be equal?

Most people are egalitarian, even if they wouldn't use the word or don't know the word.\n\n\nI feel that everyone deserves equal access to life and everything it has to offer, and that if someone needs more help getting access than another person, they should be helped. The way I see it, feminism is an intersection of egalitarianism that specifically focuses on women, their struggles, and leveling the playing field for them. Bot sexes have struggles, but women have pretty much always been and in a lot of ways still are at a greater disadvantage, having a lot of unique struggles that men don't typically have. Feminism is about combating that \"little extra\" that women have to overcome just for being women.\n\n\nIt isn't bad to focus in on different groups of people, and it isn't necessarily bad to give a little more or less attention to one group than another. As long as that attention doesn't put one group ahead of or above another in terms of advantage.\n\n\nLike that picture going around all over the internet of 3 people trying to watch a baseball game from behind a fence. One is tall, one medium, and one short. Equality isn't giving them all a crate to stand on, because the tallest person doesn't need it and for the shortest person, that still isn't enough to see over the fence. Equality is giving everyone what they need so they can be at the same level, even if that means giving the shortest person 2 crates to stand on while the tallest person doesn't get any to stand on. As long as they're all now the same height and can all see over the fence.",

If you want to talk about oppression, go live in a poor <b> African </b>country, or much of China, etc. And, guess what kids, they ads worked, not because they are true to life, but because they weren't!! Good grief, are young people so stupid today as to think that anyone took these ads seriously?!!? My mom grew up in that era, and believe me, you'd search long and hard to find a more loving, tougher (in the way that matters)<b>  woman</b> in today's world. She didn't think \"tough\" meant beating people up, but getting that which was her due, which she MANIFESTLY did. How dare you ignorant chirpers think you actually KNOW what went on when those ads were prevelent, as routine surverys show that most younger folks can't even tell you what century the U.S. Civil War was fought. Focus on getting some real knowledge, and forget trying to look intelligent about something you kno<b> w nothin</b>g about.",

I'd show those abusive husbands what its like to challenge a <b> woman </b>from the 21st century. I wish, I'm brave and can be ballsy in some situations, but I'm not a reckless idiot.

But don't act as if it still goes on! those advertisers did their jobs, afrerall it made toy talk about it right? and since you talked about it you'll think about it and maybe even buy some of their products!",

This is a very skewed look at ads both modern and 1900's, you only show the \"bad ones\" for women not the ones that existed for men modern or older. Was it bad that this happened yes but guess what you can't change the past, but you can work for a better future so don't bother digging all this up and when you want to bring up the modern era ads use all styles not just the \"sexed up\" ads of women, there are sexed up ads of men and even ads that straight up say men are idiots which is incorrect the same way women aren't. These ads were not good but don't try to say it was only women who got the shaft from ads.",

In the past I've been told I look like a girl, a hippy, a mop head, Justin Beiber etc. Every man in a hair related advert has short hair. As I had chronic depression for many years, such things hurt my self confidence greatly.\n\n'How often do you see medication for men saying \"the number one reason you take _ is for your girl\"?' \u2013 most things for men (deodorant, <b> alcohol,</b> clothes, hair) are marketed as ways to \u2018get' the girl. It's the same on both sides \u2013 ever heard of <b> \u2018sex</b> sells'?\n\n'How often would you say that, in modern advertisements, men are the ones being portrayed as objects and are being portrayed as submissive?' \u2013 have you seen that coca-cola advert where the guy is cutting the grass and then takes his shirt off in slow motion while a bunch of girls watch? Most adverts with men in them \u2013 clothing ads, hairstyle/ product ads \u2013 have men taking their tops off and pouting at the camera. Is this not \u2018objectification'? It works both ways (again,<b>  \u2018se</b>x sells').\n\n'How often would you say that men are shamed for their half-nude bodies because it's \"pornographic\"?' \u2013 I don't like it when guys walk around half naked any more than I like to see girls walk around half naked. It's attention seeking, regardless <b> of gend</b>er.\n\n'How often would you say, and to what extent, that men are pressured to be long, le<b> an, </b>tan, blonde, small-nosed, big-breasted, hairless on the body, etc.?' \u2013 I'll answer your question with a question: How often would you say, and to what extent, that women are pressured to be tall, dark-skinned, muscular, and have short hair with chiselled good looks?

That's sexualising too, but most men don\u00b4t get pissed about it. I don\u00b4t know if it\u00b4s because they like being framed that way, dominant, macho and sexy.",

It's like, 'Buy this product, you'll look amazing!' or 'Huge sale on all bras!'\nIt's not all about pleasing men, it's also about a <b> woman </b>wanting to feel good about herself, feel sexy, or even make her happy with having that product. It's not like all women wear or do things just to please men; most, if not all women, wear makeup because they want to; it's not like, 'I wear makeup and this type of clothing just for men and only to please them,' no.\nI don't see too many magazines for men when I'm in a waiting room, maybe 2 or 3 out of 10. I don't know, maybe women find more inspiration in things or like food, clothing, decorating ideas more than men. It's just how we are wired.",

And women became feminists because of those\nbad cultural \"norms\".\n\nSadly, the bad men will be bad.  And the good men seem few.\nBut it's not all true.  It just seems that way, because it's easier\nto get mad at the bad.  But harder to appreciate and easy to\ntake the good for granted.\n\nCurrent society issues ar<b> e craz</b>y extreme reactions.\nEither spoils a child or abuses a child.  Or overly fearful for\nthe child, to the point that is somewhat not healthy but in\na more subtle way.\n\nB<b> ut nobo</b>dy is perfect.\n\nAnd most parents are actually doing the best they can.\nAnd some are almost great parents. \u00a0But I don't believe\nin human perfection.\n\nOnly in Jesus Christ and God's Word. \u00a0Within the context\nof the New Testament and properly handled in context with\nthe whole library of books. \u00a0Not taken out of context to be\nmisused for one's personal agenda. \u00a0Money, power or\npeople w<b> ith men</b>tal issues that lead people <b> into c</b>razy cults.",

Men have to pay for their elaborate dates, their grand homes, and expensive clothes and she just sits there and says \"so he doesn't give you a headache\". I am aware that there are stay at home dads and working couples and all those other stuff but there are STILL men working hard for this. Women, don't say that your men are annoying if they pay your mortgage or your clothes or all of those things. Say that when you are the one working. Sometimes those working men just get annoying because of the stress in their work. For working at a job that they don't even like. Yes I am a working dad with two kids and an astounding wife but the only problem with her is that she nags and she doesn't just nag, she NAGS. She keeps on complaining about everything that I couldn't give her. I guess maybe because she also works in a job but she gets weekends off and only works in mondays too wednesdays and to me, that is already heaven and I wouldn't complain anymore if I get that kind of job while getting a similar salary as with my job as a pediatrician. I could be a painter or an author but none of my writings are that good and I put all of my drawings in the garbage already. Besides, I don't think I'll be able to support my babies and my wife with that job. Women, please try to understand your men because they are not annoying, they are just stressed. My wife says that I'm annoying but that's because I am just trying to keep my stress in while communicating with her. I help her clean the house and care for the children but she doesn't recognize that. I just wish society would be like my grandma and grandpa's generation but better, the 50s, and I hope that women would try to understand that they are not the only ones struggling in life. Please",

                    "commentText": "to say that there has been a far larger amount of male geniuses throughout history isn't a valid point to make due to the fact that most women weren't educated in the typical subjects that people consider 'genius' subjects (science, maths, philosophy etc), and that was if they were the lucky few who received an education. Therefore, there has been more male 'geniuses' than female ones, but if both boys and girls had been able to receive the same education in the past, the genius club would be fairly equal in <b> gender.</b> And, of course, I didn't say anything about girls being SMARTER than boys, I said that they do better in school. There is, in fact, a difference. Due to the way the brains of developing children become different, due to things like girls developing earlier, and boys producing testosterone which can affect things like concentration, school is easier for girls, so they, on average, do better.\n\n\nAlso, the IQ test has been proven to have no value when it comes to evaluating someone's knowledge and intelligence.( [LINK] \n\nhere is the proof for what I was saying before  [LINK] ",

Okay so it was expected BACK THEN, but now adays it's apparently sexist as well, we're not expected to be so, but if I chose to be a housewife I'm sexist to a lot of people (Or as I've been told). Excuse me? I'd love to stay home all day everyday and get an allowance from my husband. Thank you. - All jokes aside, being a housewife isn't really easy breezey. You have kids and a whole house to clean from those kids you have to raise till they're 18 or sometimes over 18. You've got the drama, the messes, the screaming and crying, you've gotta mop, vacuum, clean counters and tables, wash clothes, if you got dogs you gotta care for them too. It's a harder job than people put it out to be and then people act as if when the husband comes home he does <b> nothing,</b> that's such bullshit and sexist in it's own right! The majority of couples I've seen where the girl is a housewife and the husband works all day, he comes home and helps her, in fact my own boyfriend has constantly told me he'd clean his own mess up. I don't know, I just felt like I had to say it..",

There's jokes about everything why can't there sometimes be a semi sexist joke once in a while? Not just about women but men too. I just don't see how some of them (again not all but some of these ads) are so offensive. I find some of them very funny.\n\n\nAnd excuse, the last time I checked when I have a bad hair day I kinda do feel like shooting myself or someone, UGH! D:< lol",

            "commentText": "\"No one wants to go back in time but white men.\"\n\nThat is not entirely true, unless you're talking about the the last couple hundred years or so when colonization was rampant around the world, facilitated by some white men. There were, however, even in the last couple hundred years, places where people that were not white prospered. For example, Japan.\n\nBut if you go farther back in time, there are plenty of time periods and places where different types of people prospered. Europe, Asia, Central America, South and North America, even Africa(think Mansa Musa and the Mali Empire) were all rich lands at one point or other, which means that most of the major <b> ethnic </b>groups have had(at different proportions maybe) a share of wealth and prosperity in the past. (Using the Mali example if you're from Mali you could go back in time to 1300s Mali and live a nice life). So based on this I would not say that \"No one wants to go back in time but white men\" is true.",

Every time! \u00a0It seriously wasn't until university that I slowly realized how good you might be at something wasn't necessarily always because of your<b>  gender</b>. \u00a0In this case I was sort of conditioned into thinking boys would be automatically crappier than things girls did.",

They must feel so stupid right now because they have done <b> nothing </b>to stop this long-time issue.\n\nMaybe women were meant to be oppressed and man was meant to be pleased? Maybe women were meant to be submissive and man was mean to be dominant?\n\nRead this:\n\n\"However, nowadays, more women are graduating from college than men. Women in women-only universities are much more likely to go into math, engineering and science, because they haven't encountered the same harassment, bias, and discouragement as women in co-ed schools.\u00a0\n\n(I am in the sciences, and there is enormous male bias. For example,<b>  ZERO</b> of my teachers in my major are women. There are TONS of women in my field, but are not hired by our department<b> . Zer</b>o of the textbooks used are written by wome<b> n. ZE</b>RO! The content is strongly biased toward patriarchal perspectives and assumptions...\u00a0\n\njust as your question is!\u00a0\n\nTo undo your ignorance, take Women's Studies and read feminist books. Lots of them.\u00a0\n\nTry this:\u00a0\n\nGo to your bookshelves. Take a book off the shelf, and look at the author's name (or photo. etc.) If it's male, put it back on the left end of the shelf: female, right end of the shelf.\u00a0\n\nYou can be creative with books authored by both women AND men, or if you can't tell <b> the </b>sex of the author: set them aside for now, or put them in the middle, or go with the name of the first author listed, etc.\u00a0\n\nThen pick up the next book, and do the same. Auth<b> or's</b> sex, left end of the shelf for men, right end for women. Do this with all of the books on the shelf. Do this for the next shelf as well.\u00a0\n\nThen look at each shelf, to see how many of the books (in shelf length) are by men, and how many by women?\u00a0\n\nMeasure the length on each shelf of books by men, and add the distances up. Do the same with books by women.\u00a0\n\nThen ask yourself, what does this tell you about your book choices? About the your own biases? Your teachers or profs? The books you keep vs. those you give away or sell back?\u00a0\n\nWhat does it say about your educational biases? Do you value traditionally \"male\" fields and thinking over traditionally \"female.\" Why is that? Is it an accident, or is it a reflection of society's beliefs about the value of \"women's\" work vs. \"men's\"?\u00a0\n\nCalculate the number of years you've been acquiring books. What percent of your shelves are occupied by men's books? By women's?\u00a0\n\nThat's a good numerical reflection of how much you value men's ideas over women's.\u00a0\n\nIf you were to now start buying and reading books 50/50 by men and women, would that change the educational bias toward men's ideas (or women's) that you have had so far in your life?\u00a0\n\nOr would you still end up with an imbalance, because the shelves were already imbalanced, for the first ____ # of years of your life.\n\n-Ms. Magazine\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThink for a minute.",

You can't say there is no pressure on young boys to have a six pack and a toned body just like young girls feel pressure to look a certain way too.",

Why the men's ads are more conservative is because men don't usually strive for the \"slurry sexy\" kind of thing, they know they will pick up women if they dress \"classy sexy\".

Im not saying the topic couldnt be done well, it just isnt, and the issues they bring up arnt even issues. And on the topic <b> of gend</b>er, they have the usual representation of Men and Women in Media when they do their acted skits.

Legal departments are anal about EVERYTHING now to avoid being sued. I've seen whole projects get yanked and redesigned because an appliance company could claim legally somr environmental effects of their product.\nAnd it was like a sentence.\n\nBut the sexualization is WAY out of control.

True these vintage ads were sexist towarss women, but there were probably others that were just as sexist towards men. Its all about perspective and the core demographic. If you're marketing towards men it is beneficial to use <b> sexual </b>imagery, and if you're marketing towards women it is beneficial to make fun of men. Im not saying its right, but marketing companies spend millions of dollars a year in research to understand trends, cultural thinking, and psychology. So before you scream \"patriachry\", maybe you should be looking at why these ads work in the first place. After all, if they didnt work they wouldnt be published.",

Now imagine it like this, the <b> woman </b>use that shirt, while let's say.. reading a book (random, i know). Let me tell you a sad story, it would not sell better or at least the same with if the ad is playing the sexy card.. after all, it's the women of today who loves to be seen as a beautiful sexy being, and loves things that represent sexyness (does that word even exist?) We would never do things that wouldn't please customers, which for that unisex clothing <b> (woman</b> ad) are the ladies themselves. Stop blaming the media.",

Also, why do americans totally ignore the rest of the world at it's history? You think white men are always the opressors? Ffs, do some research.\nYes, 100 years ago in the USA (for example) men and women both had it bad, depending on the point of view, both sexes were dependent on eachother, women maybe had it worser then men.\nBut women have had the same rights as men for decades now. Right now women have more rights than men, more benefits, and still feminism covers mens problems and fights for the opposite of equality. Feminism is rotten, it's not fighting for equality. MOST feminists are <b> blind </b>because of all the feminist propaganda (for example BuzzFeed) Both sexes deserve equality. There are feminists fighting for equality, but they are a minority, and completely<b>  blind</b> to how much misery and unequality their own movement has brought",

Up until the Vietnam war, the draft had not been used and instead men made the choice to go to war. I've met many men today who are proud soldiers who fight for their country because they want too. Now I do believe we live in a society where masculinity is pushed upon boys at a very young <b> age </b>and especially back in WWI and WWII times, you where not a man if you didn't fight. This ideal comes form the same Patriarchal concepts that told<b>  woman</b> that producing sons was more important that producing daughters. These are what true feminists are focused on, breaking ideals that harm both men an<b> d woma</b>n alike. The statements I don't agree with are th<b> e \"wom</b>an have more rights\" a<b> nd \"wo</b>man have the same rights\". While it may seem that w<b> hite w</b>oman have the same ri<b> ghts, </b>woman of color where not granted these rights(voting, wage gaps) until much later. I would also like to point out, while it ma<b> y seem</b> woman have more rights because we receive benefits, its along the same lines as things like Welfare. Welfare was created to help lower income people, because they needed the help. Well someone with a high income who doesn't receive this help might say \"they get more stuff, more benefits that I don't get.\" This is because they need it and you don't. The reason businesses are required to hire a certain nu<b> mber o</b>f woman but not a certain number of white men, is because historically without that requirement, businesses run by white men only hire white men.",

Feminism has influenced many law changes, and many were for the worst, further agaisn't equality, because it keeps lowering male life quality, when they already are the ones with less life quality and benefits.\nRape Laws and Domestic Violence laws implemented with the help of feminism completely ignores violence and rape agaisn men. If I we're to call the police because my gf was beating me, the police would jail me. If I don't film me getting beat up, I'd be considered guilty.

This is an idea that is slowly changing, and many feminists that I have talked to also advocate for male survivors. It's not as<b>  black</b> and white as you may think it is.\u00a0<b> \n\"NOBOD</b>Y said blame was on the women\" I hear what you're saying here. What frustrates me, however, is that when women (I guess I'll say feminists now) try and change things in society that they think are unfair (not always laws, sometimes just how we are viewed and treated by the public out on the streets) we are met by a list of things that are unfair to the opposi<b> te s</b>ex. In fact, that's generally the only time issues like are brought up. Now if men believe that there are laws out there that are biased against them, I am all for listening and assisting men in changing these laws. The only thing holding me back is that it doesn't seem to be what men WANT. It's only brought up to shush feminists/women who are trying to fight to feel like they are on an equal playing field with men (again, equal in more than just laws or rights, but in how we are viewed and treated). Where is their movement for change, because I will gladly sign u<b> p!\n'Noth</b>ing stops women entering STEM fields'. I would argue that there is something stopping women from entering STEM fields, and no it's not any law or because women are still (at least not all the time) expected to stay at home and care for the house/children only. The barriers are a little more unclear than that. As a kid, it was very clear to me what boy job/interest should be, and what a girl job/interest should be. No one ever told me what went in each category, but it was implied by what teachers thought <b> each ge</b>nder would want to play with, or with the reactions you would get from your classmates if you had an interest in something that wasn't 'for girls'. Again this is something in society that is definitely changing. I think more and more females (like myself) are pursuing careers in STEM fields, but this isn't a change that happens overnight. Every day I am sure there is a girl that is pushed away or discouraged from developing a strong interest in these areas. While techni<b> cally no</b>thing stops women from entering STEM fields, there is a still a small hump we need to get over to get there.",

Feminism has the basis that women are and always were oppressed by the <b> patriarchy,</b> but in truth they had many, many privileges.\n\nJust look at the death statistics on the Titanic, most men had to die while women were saved. Even 3rd class women had higher survival rates than 1st and second class men. So yes, they were oppressed on many aspects, didn't have as many rights, but they sure didn't lack privileges. But feminists have just picked all of the bad parts of being a female, but all of the advantages remain. If a<b>  woman</b> doesn't want to work she can find a man to pay for her, if <b> a woma</b>n commits a crime people assume it wasn't as bad, if<b>  a wom</b>an is in danger everyone will jump to help, but ignore a man, if a man beats his wife in the street everyone will stop him, i<b> f a wo</b>man does it most people will laugh it off... I can go on and on and on.\n\nNow the problem is that feminists are always using oppression as explanations for things. Not enough women in engineering ? Must be oppression. Not enough women in politics ? Must be oppression and men holding them back. In truth, behaviour of both men and women are linke<b> d to se</b>xual factors since we're a dismorphic species.\n\nSo basically, feminists have been trying to solve problems that don't even exist, and have given a completely wrong view to people of society. Want an example ? Would you rather walk down the street at night as a female or a male ? Well if you answer male, like almost everyone would, you've got it wrong because you're far likely to get assaulted as a male.",

Feminism is an ideology based on false premises.\n\nThe core idea is that women are oppressed by male through patriarchal society, and therefore must be given rights so they can be the equal to men. But this alone is complete bullshit.\n\nI'll just compare women and children in society to make it more understandable. Children don't have many rights, they have to obey adults, they can get punished for bad behaviour, they have expectations like school and so on. But kids also have much lower expectations than adults, they can get away with far worse behaviour, they don't risk anywhere near the same punishments as adults, they'll get unconditionnal protection from adults and so on. Now compare this to women in society. If a boat sinks, who would have been saved first ? Women and children. Isn't it kind of <b> weird </b>to value your \"second class citizens'\" lives more than yours ? Do you really think slaves could have hoped for the same treatment ? I can say the same throughout history. In the<b>  old</b> testament, boys and men all get killed, while girls get married off.\n\nThis is in fact the same shit that feminists use to pass their idiotic ideas : they use the will of society to help and protect women to pass their ideology.\n\nMy point still stands, feminism is absolute garbage because it's just bullshit based on simply false premises.",

She at least really tries to come up with valid arguments.) And often times, as you can expect, the loudest voices represent the movement, which creates a huge problem when most of these voices don't agree with or even acknowledge some of the points you yourself brought forward, like the issue of rape of against men not being taken aeriously. As a result, these issues are put on the back burner of the feminist agenda, if it is even there at all. \n\nAnd there is a male rights \"movement\", they're called theRA's. (I put movement in parenthesis because I am hesitant to call it one.  I'll explain why and personally, I think they can be just as bad as feminists.) However, I doubt you haven't heard of them and if you havent, well, that's part of the problem. MRA's are often treated as just a mob of misogynists and a joke. They are put down by feminists and have almost <b> zero </b>influence. Again, though, I think that the MRA's can be just as bad as feminists. \n\nAnother thing about what you say regarding women joining STEM firlds: You're right to think that there is<b>  nothing</b> stopping women from joining STEM field and I am sure that some women are discouraged by friends and family to not go into a STEM field, but this is a problem concerning the individual, not government or law. However, despite this, women get a ton of assistance and care when it comes to entering universities that men just don't have. Another issue with alot feminists is that they always encourage each other, or even push each other to ente<b> r gende</b>r studies courses instead of STEM fields, ending up in having a majority of female graduates majoring <b> in gend</b>er studies instead of a STEM field. When majoring<b>  in gen</b>der studies is discouraged (often times in a childish manner, something I do disagree with), feminists retaliate by putting down these arguments and offering their own arguments as to<b>  why ge</b>nder studies isn't as useless as one may think. (This is to encourage going<b>  into g</b>ender studies rather than, say, a STEM field, mind you!)",

Also, they can always count on some man to pay for them, which is why homeless people are mostly men.\n\nMen don't get called sluts, but they do get stigmatised if they aren't manly enough, and by women too.",

No but instead they discuss the \"wage gap\" which has been thoroughly debunked since they forgot to leave out very vital information.

Objectification is different, so, for example, I do not like the burger ad but see <b> nothing </b>astonishing in the D&G ad. On the contrary, I think men should be sexualised more instead of always being portrayed and acting as thirsty beastly bystanders who lust for women. Men should feel empowered by their sexuality as a harmless mode of self expression instead of using it as a weapon to hurt women, whether physically, emotionally or psychologically. It seems as though, whilst women are almost overly comfortable in their sexuality, men have yet to embrace that aspect of themselves in the first person.",

Now if you are speaking in terms of the world then yes lower class Europeans faced much discrimination in their respective countries however in America the persecution was geared towards people of color and women. While white women received less discrimination than women of color, the persecution was still there. The ignorance most people find with the OP statement is found in the over generalization but that cannot be helped when speaking about the statistical averages of a group of people.",

                    "commentText": "@redroses3010 By the way, I ask myself many times why women\u00a0earn less money doing the exact same job as men.\u00a0It is pretty much impossible to accurately compare 2 positions held by two people. For one thing, both people would have to have the exact same experience, start at the exact same date and time, have exactly the same education, get exactly the same grades while getting that\u00a0education, and carry the exact same work load.\n\n1) I worked in a cabinet shop with\u00a02 lesbians and a <b> transsexual.</b> When it came time to unload a shipment of material, the\u00a0guys would carry 1 sheet of MDF or Melamine each. The lesbians and trans would require TWO people to carry ONE sheet. Whenever it was time to put a sheet onto the saw, they'd require assistance. When it came time to move the built cabinet into the finishing booth they required assistance. Therefore since they couldn't do the same work load as the guys, they were paid less.....and rightly so.\n\n2) I worked in a architectural department that had 5 men and 2 women. One<b>  woman</b> had 3 kids. She was almost weekly taking time off to stay at home with her\u00a0sick kid, take one to the dentist, one to the doctor, one to the pediatrician. So much so that they started docking her pay after she went through her vacation days. Of COURSE she made less than the rest (including the othe<b> r woma</b>n) because she was THERE 20% less than everyone else. When she was gone, her work had to be picked up by someone else.\n\nNow before you say \"why wasn't the husband taking time off\" I'm sure he did. And was penalized for it. But none the less, in this instance, yes, she deserved to earn 20% less than everyone else because she only did 80% of the work.\n\n3) Now this IS sexist but doesn't make it any less valid: at one point, this company I worked for used to ask\u00a0female applicants if they were married, or single, and or were planning to have children. Because as an employer, they knew that if she was recently married or planning to have children that at some point they might lose her for almost a year. That is something that has to be taken into account when hiring someone. Specially if the position cannot be filled by just anyone. Then they have to consider what happened quite a lot: they go on maternity leave, then decide not to return.\n\nNot sure if you know this but in many positions, it can cost 10's of thousands of\u00a0dollars to train someone. If you're going to dish out that money, you have to expect some\u00a0sort of ROI. If you're going to spend that money and have the trainee leave after 2 years, that's not a good investment.",

There have been studies where employers were shown identical resumes and asked how much they would offer that person in a yearly salary. The only thing changed was the name (from like John to Jane). And every single time the female was offered significantly less. And this was done with hundreds (if not thousands) of employers.\n\nAs a professional I would be mortified to be told that I will be paid less because of the <b> sex </b>I was born with, which I had no choice in. Yes, you can break it down to minute, existential criteria but the main thing salary should be based on is the quality of the person's work. Not whatever social stereotypes there may be of their<b>  gender</b>.\n\nReally it is a predisposed opinion not based on the person themselves. It does not consider them as an individual first.",

She found out I made $5.00 more an hour than she did and she flipped. So I did a printout of last years financials based on the PM code....I handled $25M worth of business, she handled $6M....I showed it to her and said \"there's why I am being paid more than you...\"\n\nThat's why I say it is difficult to pinpoint the exact same pay depending on<b>  sex</b>. I'm not talking \"tests\" like the one you mentioned, I'm talking real world. I agree, if <b> a woma</b>n does the exact same job, the same quality, and the same quantity, then it doesn't matter whether she has an innie or an outie. She should be paid the same.

However, when an employers automatically assumes that a <b> woman </b>will leave permanently due to pregnancy/motherhood, they take her individuality and choices out of the conversation entirely. You'd have to assume that 1) the<b>  woman</b> wants to have children and 2) she wants to leave her job permanently. Just because that has happened with some women (like the one you mentioned) does not mean ever<b> y woma</b>n wants that and employers shouldn't just write<b>  a wom</b>an off as a some-day mother who will leave.\u00a0\n\n\nThe burden of childcare is pretty much always put on <b> the wo</b>man so it's not entirely about women just getting equal pay but how we view the family structure. The mother is the one who is \"supposed\" to provide most of the care presumably because she is the one who carries the child and is its primary relationship for the crucial first year of life.\n\n\nAnd yes, the answer they gave for the study was pretty much that<b>  the w</b>oman will leave to start a family. But this assigning this to <b> every </b>woman is unfair. It basically says <b> that a</b> woman's individuality, her choices, and her goals for her life are insignificant and that she is defined only by her reproductive choice. And it reinforces the idea that women don't belong in the workplace because they are not as valuable assets since they may, possibly, one day, might want to leave. \n\n\nDoes this also apply to people who one day, maybe, might think about changing their careers?

Also it's a privacy issue.\n\n\n I mean, you have to get a license for driving a car, hunting, fishing, etc., but not for parenting. We don't even require people to take parenting classes unless they are getting divorced (unfortunately says a lot about actual, so-called \"family values\" in America). All of this is a sticky area because of personal freedom/choice and running a business.\n\n\nI understand that this has happened to you a lot but too often people use their personal experiences that do not and cannot apply to every <b> woman </b>across the board. I don't know what the solution could be, or if there even is one, but paying a<b>  woman</b> less because she's <b> a woma</b>n and has the ability to get pregnant and have a child is... I dunno.<b> .. la</b>me? It's almost making her choice for her. And what happens if/when she does get pregnant? Will she have enough money for hospital bills and the extra cost of simply having a child? Does that not matter as much because having a child is a personal choice? Should businesses care?\n\n\nReally it's all interconnected. We want children to be raised with parents who are around but if both parents have to work because they can't make ends meet otherwise then the children have to either go to daycare (which is quite expensive) or the mom quits her job to take care of them (which hurts the family financially) or the child stays with other family while the parents are at work (which is not always possible for many families).\u00a0\nThen there's the idea of all those individuals contributing back to society. \n\n\n\nWe stress family so much as a society but don't want the responsibility. With most of that responsibility put on women.\n\n\n(Oh, and here's one of those studies I mentioned:  [LINK] \n\n\n(Also, thanks for having a rational discussion.

A<b> ny wom</b>an that hurts her husband and not out of necessary self defense (It does happen, like your example of men who might be self defending.

Also any man should not be shamed for choosing to be a stay at home dad, either, if that makes him the happiest. These ads are still sexist, portray women in a dehumanizing way, and perpetuate negative body images as well as making light of domestic violence. These ads were NOT glori<b> fying </b>a woman's \"job\" as homemaker or even the choice to be one, they are devaluing the job of mother by presenting homemaking as servile and demeaning and something <b> that t</b>he woman deserves to get beaten by another human being, their own husband, over small mess ups. The way ad companies see humans, <b> of eith</b>er gender, is toxic to society because they care more about getting your dollar than you. So they create toxic ads that manipulate people by subtly constantly implying that people are inferior and need their product to help, and as others have said men are not immune to this attack of media stereotype. Advertising like this, or that depreciates any human unnecessarily, or portrays them<b>  as ove</b>rly sexual to sell a nonsexual product hurts us all.

No. Do I see them as some sort of plague against men? No, that's silly.\n\n\nIf anything some of those ads he shows off are almost as offensive to women as it is to men. From a sales pitch direction, they're clearly trying to pander to women's sensitivities, which can be just as demeaning as the men they portray.\u00a0\n\n\nThe bigger issue is perceived cultural norms and its reflection in the media. Something that guy constantly overlooks in his video. He also seems to think that feminism is a monolithic movement by using strawman arguments by feminists to elevate his own position. He seems to ignore that there are plenty of feminists out there who deride and are against some of the same ads he uses as evidence that there's a greater shift in culture towards misanthropy. \n\n\nAlso, I find it ridiculous that he insists that you can't have an ad solely aimed for men, when there's clear evidence to the contrary of that. He considers his own anecdotal experience as \"fact\" and simply throws away anything that contradicts it as an anomaly.",

Kind of like the equal oppurtunity mandate that came down from the US federal government. It examined certain geographical areas and made determinations on how many of each <b> race </b>each employer should have. Then went around fining those employers who didn't meet those numbers. What happened was (case in point) a small lighting manufacturer in the outskirts of LA should have had 3.2<b>  black</b> people working there....they didn't have any. They DID have 5 latinos, 3 chinese, 2 italian....when <b> a blac</b>k guy applied for a job they advertised, and didn't get it because he couldn't tie his own shoe laces, he complained. The company was fined $45,000.00, laid off 5 people to cover the cost of the fine...the reason he didn't have the right number <b> of bla</b>ck people working there? Only one applied and they weren't qualified for the job....\n\nAs for ability, once again you are solely focusing on white collar jobs...hate to break it to you but there are MILLIONS of jobs where women are more able than men, and MILLIONS of jobs where men are more able than women.....and even MORE jobs where it doesn't matter.\u00a0\n\nIt is ABILITY.....i<b> f a wo</b>man isn't smart enough, doesn't have the education or experience, then she won't be able to do the job.....and vice versa.<b> ...A w</b>oman isn't able to do a lab tech's job IF SHE DIDN'T GO TO UNIVERSITY FOR IT...please tell me you're not that stupid to think that a person is able to do a job simply based on <b> thei</b>r sex?\n\nI've used this example before: I worked in a cabinet shop with 4 guys, 2 lesbians<b>  and a trans</b>sexual. When we'd get a delivery of sheet goods, we'd all pile out to unload it. The guys would carry one sheet each, the 2 lesbians one sheet between them and the trans would stand around waiting until one of the lesbians was free to help him/her.....So no, they were NOT able to do the same job as the guys....In addition, when it came time to take a sheet off the rack and put it on the saw, they required assistance...the guys didn't. When it came time to load the assembled cabinet onto a trolly to take to the finishing booth, they needed help, the guys didn't. When it came time to load unload the finished cabinet onto our delivery truck, they required assistance, the guys didn't.\n\nSo no, the women weren't paid the same as the men because they couldn't do the same work as the men..based on their ABILITY....\n\nAnd btw, the finishing guy got paid more than them because they didn't have the ability to spray lacquer or finish the cabinets...therefore they couldn't do the job based on their ABILITY. Now were they better for getting inside the cabinets to install hardware? yes...but that is a very VERY small part of the job......carrying things is 50% of the job....",

If you're so ignorant to not even acknowledge this, I'm done talking to you because you lack even the most basic fundamentals to carry on an intelligent conversation.\n\nSingle income households: ahem, hate to break it to you but it hasn't. I worked in construction with about 40 other guys and of all the ones who still had kids at home, they ALL were the sole breadwinner....so, blow it OUT your rear Ms Know it all.....\n\nYou wonder how much laundry I've done? Holy crap, are you THAT ignorant? You think men don't do laundry? Jesus....you're the epitome of an ignorant sexist misandrist...I've been doing laundry for the past 40 years you twit and yes, most of it has been just for me, but even when I was a teen if I didn't collect all my laundry and put it in the laundry room, SORTED It didn't get washed and when I was living with someone? I VOLUNTEERED TO DO IT and even SHE was surprised I knew how to separate the delicates, from the colours, from the heavy.....furthermore, every guy I've known over the past 50 years (except for maybe TWO) helped out with laundry EVEN if they were the sole breadwinner and worked a full time job.....\n\nYeah, laundry is SUCH a chore, I bet you're the anal retentive OC idiot that irons jeans and socks and underwear....I tell you, NONE of my clothes I wear daily need ironing...NONE. My shirts are hung up out of the dryer so they don't get wrinkled and my underwear? lol yeah ok RIGHT..\n\nBTW: I've been involved with families with teens and they TOO have been taught that if it isn't in the laundry room, it doesn't get washed. If there's stuff in the pockets? it doesn't get washed. If it isn't separated? it doesn't get washed....and THEY are responsible for their own folding, ironing or whatever else they want to do with it....maybe because YOU are too lazy to teach kids how to care for themselves that is why it's such a chore for you....\n\nPre-treating stains? LOL do you live with <b> PIGS?</b> I work construction and I don't pre-treat stains FFS......btw, hate to break it to you, but there's a button on the washing machine for that.....talk about making a mountain out of a molehill....btw, if YOU have 2 or 4 piglets running around staining their clothes? That's YOUR choice, don't come back on anyone else for your ills when no one put a gun to your head to breed that many slobs.....or marrying one for that matter!\n\nLOL oh poor poor you, your sexist remarks aren't depressing, you're insane!

So, I've not managed to go through the entire thread, so if I repeat something already said, or address a discussion already ended somewhere, sorry, feel free to say that, and I'll go looking.\n\nFirst off: all through this thread, you seem to jump to the conclusion that feminist = <b> feminazi.</b> This even though most of the women I see posting in this thread are not man-hating people that want to be better off than men, but people striving towards a less oppressive society for men and women. I see the same problem with a lot of women in comment sections like these, jumping to the conclusion that men posting on videos are all the types that dismisses oppression of women with the argument \"but we have it bad too\". That is basis for miscommunication and getting a reasonable discussion off to the wrong start.\n\nAbout the entire \"women get paid less, when they can do less\". I see your point, and in some ways I'm inclined to agree with you that people being able to physically do less should be paid less. However, you say if it's not a physical job, they'd be paid the same. But shouldn't the same concept apply there? You'll have people that solve problems more efficiently or to better effect than others, so why shouldn't that reflect in the pay? The big problem is, it's way more difficult to quantify than who can carry more. \n\nSame problem, I feel, ties into the abuse. You argue that<b>  woman</b> on men abuse happens way more than you'd imagine. I don't know, because I don't know which study you're referring to, but I can imagine that a big part of this abuse i<b> s menta</b>l rather than physical. Since it's much more difficult to prove than proven someone showing up at the police station completely beaten up has been abused, it isn't addressed as much, and sometimes downright ignored as a non-existing problem. And I definitely believe that's wrong. It is a problem, and should be addressed. But using that argument to diminish that the problem of physical abuse against (I imagine) mainly women is counter productive.",

Police have been told (starting like 10 years ago) to change their procedure to investigate and determine what was going on...hence why now men aren't automatically arrested AND the report shows that HE was the victim of abuse....Last time I looked it was increasing at about 5 to 8% per year....which also leads one to conclude that those high stats women's rights groups have been touting all these years? aren't correct if 40% of the time the man was wrongfully accused and arrested.....(not saying it isn't a terrible thing when<b>  a wom</b>an is abused and that it doesn't happen, just might not be as frequent as previously thought).\u00a0\n\nAs for your scenario about someone mentally being able to do a job better. That happens between men as well. Some who are better suited to a job may or may not be paid better than someone who isn't.....the key to determining this is the quality of the work....\n\nThe problem is: with many situations, all women are not created equal. One women may be better at nursing, one may be better at accounting. The issue I have is it is never addressed this way. The statement that \"women are as good as men and should be paid as such\"....doesn't fly. Some women might be better than a man at x job, but not all women will be. Just like not all men are good at all jobs.....\n\nPerfect example: I was datin<b> g a wo</b>man who was a waitress. I was in charge of millions of dollars worth of projects. I took an aptitude test to get a part time job at the post office over christmas. I failed. She revelled in it.....I said \"no wonder you passed, the whole test was about short term memory and I can't remember what I did 5 minutes ago. But I can tell you what you wore on our first date 5 years ago, where we went, what you ate, and how much the bill was....you see, she had a GREAT short term memory being a waitress...not because she was female and I was male, but because of her ability (st memory)......she had NO clue how to build a product more efficiently...yet I did that every day......\n\nThe whole men vs women thing is lumping people into two groups...there are literally thousands of groups, none of which are base<b> d on</b> sex....it is ALL ability/capability.",

If women get 3 weeks vacation and men 2, that's sexist. If both men and women are given vacation time based on their years of service that's NOT sexist.\u00a0\n\nI'm having a discussion with an idiot elsewhere who thinks that women should be allowed in male sports and that men shouldn't be allowed in female sports because their strength would give them an unfair advantage.

It was only me taking the term choice & running with it...Grammar, the difference in feeling your nuts and feeling you're nuts....When I was able to work, my place of employment defined maternity leave as time taken off after the mother gives birth. That never changed in the 20+ years I worked there.\nAgain, I support both maternity & paternity leave. I also support allowing women in sports that have traditionally been considered for men, but not without allowing men the same consideration when it comes to sports traditionally considered to be for women. I believe if men & women do play those sports, they should not expect special considerations based on their<b>  sex</b>....ie: if <b> a woma</b>n wants to play on a male football team, she best be prepared to take the hard hits just like every other team member.....I have 4 brothers & 2 sisters. My sisters & I never expected special treatment just because we were females. That would not have worked in my rough & tumble, hard working, hard playing family.\u00a0 I have never fought \"like a girl\" either.

I spent a lot of great years working in the operating room, but that never took precedence over my children no matter how <b> old </b>they were. The last 6 years of my career were spent traveling the states & islands to low staffed hospitals to help fill that need until they could hire someone. The pay was fantastic, I traveled on my companies dime & I worked 3 months on 2 weeks off, sometimes I took a month between assignments, but that was not often. The traveling worked well for me because while I was doing that, my husband was deployed to Iraq. Add all of his deployments up & we spent a total of 5 1/2 years apart, but such is the life of a military family. He is retired now..... I was scheduled to do a six month assignment in Hawaii when Lupus reared its ugly head & took me out of the game.",

Be the one who stays home, has to look pretty for your man, raise the kids, and do all the cooking and cleaning. But clearly there were women who wanted more than that, which was perfectly fine. When women realized they had just as much rights to opportunities, society changed. Women shouldn't be obligated to do these things just because they are women. In a relationship the efforts should be equal Men should have the equal responsibility. And today, it's changed. Men know how to cook, clean, raise children and simple tasks women were only seen as fit to do. There are men who are stay at home while women work.",

If the husband works 8 to 10 hours a day, why should he have to come home and cook and clean? Did the wife go to HIS work and help him fill out those reports, dig the ditch, build a stud wall, work in the coal mine?

(yes i know, prepare for outrage, right) Before the mob gets here, I'd like to acknowledge that many families have changed things up by having the <b> woman </b>work while her husband stays home.\n\nIn the past, and in my own traditional upbringing; being able to hold down your home and your husband was something to be proud of.<b>  Gender</b> roles were actually embraced. Now, there's feminism and a stronger focus on equality. (and unlike women who came before me, our generation has a choice.. we don't HAVE to cling to a man just so the kids can eat.\n\nSadly, though, women objectify themselves just as much (if not more) than men do. We fight each other over the attention of men. Showing more skin and being sexier is what we've done to ourselves, and of course the men like it. I'm sure women had as much to do with those ads as men. I mean, just look around you; look how women dress, look at what we display so proudly on Facebook.. twerking and going out half-naked.\n\nFood for thought: How do you feel this \"self-expression\" of ours has changed the definition of \"Manhood\". Ask an older man what it means to be a man, then ask one of our generation. Better yet... LOOK at them.\n\nMen can be dawgs, but lets not blame them for our own failure to represent a better standard. We can be some dawgs too.",

I want a world where a man or a women can go up in an ad or a photoshoot and be sexy, where females can be sexy and objectified without being hated for it, where men can be objectified too. Objectification isn't actually a bad thing, its good if both sexes do it to each other because it is natural. It is natural for a human to be attracted to another human because of their physical appearance, and it is natural for Advertisements to take advantage of this fact. The only reason Feminists hate objectification is because they feel entitled, like their body is some temple that cannot be looked at, and all eyes have to divert it when it walks by. No...it is a hunk of cells, we are all objects, and it is ok for other humans to see you as one.

A sex-friendly ad where everyone wanted it would maybe feature a <b> woman </b>in the center and men gently touching part of her body... Not hovering above her like he's going to hold her down and hurt her. She's not only turned away from him but her face is scrunched up and she honestly looks like she's in pain. 2) In the \"gangbang\" (gangrape...) ad half of the males were shirtless. The<b>  woman</b> was wearing a very revealing outfit. It was, yknow, matching. The reason the contrast is so sexist is because the man is fully clothed but th<b> e woma</b>n is not... (which is<b>  a comm</b>on way in pornos to show dominance and if you think this kind of different in media/advertisement is healthy then you're wrong.)\n\n\nYou cannot trust advertisement to give sexy-friendly/sex-positive images. You have to look at FEMALE ROLE MODELS to do that. Popular ones are Nicki Minaj, Beyonce, women who embrace sexuality publicly. If you think these women don't have powerful female role models then you are wrong. Advertisements are not ROLE MODELS but they are horribly damagingly influential to any young girl who may see them.\n\n\nJust caus<b> e a wo</b>man may enjoy gangbangs doesn't mean it should be shown off publicly in media also. And especially not so violently. (Also women in porn don't enjoy gangbangs if you are trying to get at that. The porn industry is basically the rape industry.)",

And if you knew anything about male models, you'd understand why the presumption of being <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>is not exactly a stretch of the imagination.\n\nYou obviously didn't read my comment. Brain scans of men show that they respond positively to images of scantly clad women and poorly to images of scantly clad men. Brain scans of women show THE SAME RESULTS. Women have more of a positive response to male imagery, but they also have highly positive responses to female imagery. This is why advertisers use these images. They don't just randomly stick women on their ads, they do market studies and go with the data. This is what people want MALE AND FEMALE. If you are one of the small fraction of people who respond poorly to these images, then you are a statistical outlier and no major brands waste their time marketing anything to you. They leave that to the niche companies.\n\nYour assumptions are ridiculous. I'm only sexist if I feel like on<b> e gende</b>r is superior to another or that one is inferior to another. This isn't how I feel, therefore I'm not. And where the hell does white play into this at all? You aren't just sexist, you'<b> re raci</b>st as well! Nice projection though, calling me those things because I don't lock step in line with your thinking. People like you are why so many people are refusing to identify as feminist. I'm sitting here agreeing that the older ads were overtly sexist and terrible and that women should be respected and treated as equals in society. Yet, I'm being bashed because I can see a difference between \"sexy\" and \"sexist\"? There are two schools of thought with feminism: One is that women are free to be<b>  as sex</b>ual as men and shouldn't have a stigma of being slut shamed as a result. The other is that the media over-sexualizes women reducing them to objects and that they should cover themselves and concentrate more on intellectual aspects of femininity. Well, I fall into camp number one and you fall in camp two. You are obviously in camp two, because you s<b> ee a w</b>oman scantly clad and consider that a rape, and don't take into consideration that she might like to be naked or se<b> xy or s</b>exual of her own free will, or that she doesn't see \"sin\" when bare skin is involved in artistic photography - and those personal stances may very well be why she became a model to begin with. Should we just FORBID women from modeling? Should we cover them in burkas and not let anyone see their bare skin? And before you say \"well then why don't men pose scantly clad\" try looking at ANY other D&G ad. It's abs and sausage wall to wall. The man in the ad we're discussing has less clothing th<b> an the</b> woman. Get over yourse<b> lf, you</b> racist, sexist idiot.",

People in saudi arabia do, some women posted pictures of themselves driving when they saw all of the movements from america. They got arrested when they were caught. And fyi, i want <b> gender </b>equality for both genders. Male and female. I wanna slap someone when they say that men cant get molested, or shouldn't cry , or have to be muscular to be a man",

A girl makes men g<b> o craz</b>y because of how she smells(or looks then again it might be for clothes), but ofc you only focus on the women -.- even she's probably the one with most clothes in the add. Also it's an add for clothes (or perfume idk) most of the time is gonna be assosiated with being ''sexy''.\u00a0\n-Burger King: you have to really overthink it to think it's sexist. The add is clearly being comical kinda like saying ''it's as good <b> as s</b>ex'' then again i do admit that food shouldn't be advertised w<b> ith </b>sex.But at the same time i doubt the idea behind the add is that ''she doesn't want it'' because then the add itself doesn't make any sense, they are selling food, the idea is that she wants it!\n-The Shirt: ''I would be cool with this add, if thisman was also showing me his six pack'' well guess what he did two adds ago he just wasn't wearing his shirt. Also i'm sure they are selling it to men and not women also you're looking two adds of the same shirt, ONLY TWO, i'm sure if you look deep enough you'll find an add of the same shirt of a guy showing his abs. And the<b> re's not</b>hing wrong with that, because half of the reason people buy certain clothes is because they want to look attractive, human<b> s are s</b>exual bee<b> ns not </b>sexual objects, you can't buy women or men at a store for 50$.",

Someone might have experienced <b> racism </b>in the world that could have ruined or is ruining their life or someone they loves and someone else in the world could be encountering<b>  sexism</b> that could be doing the same. (women being killed/burned/stoned in parts of the world for doing something seen as masculine).

And even if it weren't natural, none of us have the right to ban something perceived as natural because what is considered natural is always determined by man. If we were to go with your reasoning, cigarettes would be illegal. Plastic, houses, cars, etc. would all be illegal because they aren't natural. Whether or not someone likes having <b> sex </b>with men or women is none of my concern because I am not the one responsible for their actions. They are people just like you and can deal with the consequences of their actions just like you can. I also reject the idea that something should be discouraged and persecuted simply because you see it as disgusting and an \"abomination\". I like, though, that you used the word abomination because it lets me know that your entire argument is based in your religious convictions. I'm glad, though, that I live in a society that protects me from people like you, people who want to use subjective dogma written by men thousands of years ago and apply it to today's world. An additional note, abomination in the Bible did not mean what it does today. Linguists have determined time and time again that abomination ment unorthodox in ancient times. Check your facts, check your privilege, and check your attitude about the world you actually live in (not the one you want to).",

There are few people in this world who are truly straight, but so many identify as straight because of tradition, dogma, or they feel that that's how they identify because they like women more than men. I agree most of sexuality is determined in utero, but not in the way you believe. A baby's time in the womb gives it the genes that could be \"exploited\" (in the sense that a baby's actions and life outside the womb force or encourage the baby to rely on them.

People tend to do these things in private, not in the middle of the street. Chances of actually coming across it are very low. So hey, they can do what they want, right? Not hurting me. Makes them happy, so more power to them. And I think I read something about society not working <b> if <b> g</b</b>>ay people exist. Why not? Again, small part of the population, so it's not really going to affect you or me. And I also don't really see<b>  wh<b> y</b</b>> gay people being unable to have kids factors into this. The thing is, there will ALW<b> AYS<b>  </b</b>>be gay people, you can't stop it, and I see no reason to.

It's just the logic that \"therefore you have to stop caring about women's rights to simply mention the existence of men's issues\" that I don't agree with. I'm not saying you think that, but some people do. And what it causes is that then men are getting shamed simply for feeling pain sometimes. That really rubs salt in the wound.

I don't like to say I'm a feminist, because although I am for the idea of <b> gender </b>equality, I will acknowledge that the word's meaning has become tainted.\nI agree with you in doing something that 'women are told they can't do' - actions speak louder than words.\nBut I think it's a bit unfair to claim that all feminists hate on men. Really, this comment thread was written by a guy complaining about something that isn't the point of the video, and these ladies were just telling him what it was, not 'hating on men'.\nSorry if I'm being direct, but I don't think anyone in this thread was being intentionally hateful. :)",

It can be the result of activities or arrangements that set out to discriminate or harm, or it can result from ignorance or inadvertence. As an example, let us take one of the oldest institutions in American history, marriage. In pre-modern America, in fact in most societies of the time, marriage was a contract. A representation of the trading of property. This property was th<b> e woma</b>n, along with t<b> he wom</b>an was a dowry(sum of money to be paid to the future husband) and perhaps some land. The parents of the daughter would get in return a guarantee of either financial stability or familial ties to a more wealthier family. This is why <b> the wo</b>man takes the mans last name, it is a symbol of owner ship. This is also why a man may be shamed for adultery b<b> ut a w</b>oman would be killed for it. Now we move to post-modern Ame<b> rica, </b>woman no longer are given to the man nor is there a large sum of money to be given to the man either however it is still tradition in many less progressive places t<b> he the</b> woman father pay for the wedding. Now while you may say that it is no longer sexist for this to occur because it is something both the bride and groom to be want, you cannot deny that the beginnings of this institution where made in the foundati<b> on tha</b>t woman are property and that this thought process continued though out history because the belief has been institutionalized in the society.",

These people can either be male or female human beings, although the ideology is commonly (and perhaps falsely) associated mainly with women.\"\n\n [LINK] \n<b> \n\nMisandr</b>y:\n-\"Generall<b> y, misand</b>ry refers to the hatred and oppression of men on a genotypic basis\" - [LINK] \n-\"Dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against men.\" - [LINK] \n\n\nAnd, as you can see from the /literal/ definition- They contrast quite differently. Equality for women /does not/ equal to man hating. Why? Because that's /not/ equality; And actual feminist understand this. Try looking up someone like Emma Wattson; She explains these things with brilliance in her speeches and truly is an amazing character.\n\n\nYes, there<b>  is sex</b>ism for both sides. The reason people say it's <b> more co</b>mmon for women is because it's believed to be much more present in today's society than it is for men; It's always been that way. Though, when looking at it; There is always, almost /always/ going <b> to be s</b>exism on both sides no matter the case. A few examples;\n-\"Women have to be soft, modest, kind, sweet, gentle, ect.\"\nThat is a sexist stereotype for females. But, WITH that stereotype, we also have;\n-\"Men have to be strong, tough, badass, outgoing, ect.\"\nWhich is basically the other side of the coin, as, for most ca<b> ses of </b>sexism there will always be it's counterpart.\nAnd feminism? Feminism wants to stop that; Stop it for /both/ sides.\nMen should have every right to wear a dress, just as girls have every right to wear pants.\nGirls should have every right to deny the female stereotypes, just as men should have every right to follow them if they please.\nAnd the list goes on.\nIn the end, an actual feminist<b>  (NOT a m</b>isandry that choses to hide behind its word and change its meaning) really fights for both sides. It's j<b> ust mor</b>e common to hear about feminist fighting on the \"Females rights\" Side because of things like the wage gap which doesn't apply to men as much (though I think it really only doesn't apply to white men- I can't quite remember ^^')\nSo, hope this maybe gave you a better idea of what feminism really is!",

I actually think that it's not like \"uh pictures of women are less sexist than pictures of men\" not at all I think more that society gives us a completly wrong picture of the other <b> gender.</b> But if you think about it we as a society accept it. And we are not only 99 % sexist men. Maybe you understand what I mean but maybe I am just the typical male sexist for you who knows. But I am for equality. We are all individual so it's not about being the same but having the same rights and duties. I mean it is<b>  weird</b> that when we go on a date it's automaticly assumed that the man has to pay. Don't get me wrong I really like giving presents to others but I think these are things we need to look at. Also that women can't speak open about their sexuality as men can do is a huge issue.",

Also girls in some places (not all places so don't freaking comment about it) are getting married at very young ages with older men who they don't even know and having children as soon as possible which is disgusting. They don't even get to be what they wan't to be when they grow up. If they wanted to go to space or be car racer they can't because they have to take care of the children and cook and clean around the house. imagine doing those things for the rest of your life. and if you're a widow you don't have much to rely on, so my goal is to help spread awareness of these things and for other people to stop calling us misandrist because we don't hate men in fact they can be really helpful but we have to help women with these problems so we can't focus on men right now.

After all, this is a comment under a Youtube video and<b>  nothing</b> more. The definition of Feminism is 'to fight for equal rights' (to put it briefly) however the definition of Feminism has been scraped to the bottom of the earth. Also, don't act like we're not guilty. Men have treated women like objects but do not say that we haven't. For example, let's take Taylor Swift's song called Blank Space (no hate for her v good song 10/10), \"Oh my god, look at that face, you look like my next mistake.\" Great. What if a guy said that about a girl? Yeah, exactly. So, why is it that a girl saying it is okay? because if a guy can't say it, then a girl shouldn't be able to say it either...after all, it is 'equal rights', right?",

Its not as big as what was thought but its still there even with them adding in Occupations, Positions, Education, Job tenure, and hours worked per week.

Then I said it wasn't because exclusion wasn't sexist. Then you said that women have been complaining about exclusion in the workforce. I said that wasn't true; we have been complaining about INEQUALITY in the work force, which is not the same as exclusion. Then for some reason, you didn't understand that. I'm guessing because you don't know the definition of either. Let me help you out. Inequality is the condition of being unequal. Exclusion is the process or state of being excluded.  Exclude is to keep something out of a place, group, or privilege. That's not what we were complaining about. Understand yet?",

Let me ask u one question,did u ever see in the last 20 years lets say an ad where the guy didnt have a sixpack for example?\nIn my opinion in all the ads,if the feauture a man or a <b> woman </b>they always make sure the actor/ress has a \"perfect body\" or what they think of as perfect body...annorexic<b>  woman</b> and guyz on steroids.....its all made only so they sell more product and to bring to the viewer the impression that they need to be like the actors also because all the people from the opposit<b> e se</b>x seem to like the looks ...all ads feauture same standard types of actors.\n\nWomen look at the women in ads selling lets say pants and are like : ohh she looks so good i need to lose a couple of pounds and ill go buy those pants.That mentality is already a part of the problem.\n\nYou people gonna rage with me for saying this but i couldnt care less.Those new-gen feminists are really stupid in my opinion.I can understand the reason for the existence of a Feminists group but those should just focus on women being treated wrong by society and try to improve/change that image.NOT sit whole day on their asses and scream at random guyz coz well they are guyz ROFL\nLike i did read in a comment on this video<b>  a wom</b>an chasing a guy away while he tryed to help her and then comes here to her other stupid girls and complains about the guy trying to HELP HER.srsly btch?!?\nMost of you \"feminists\" here are anyway kids so i wonder why i bother typing this but i still hope it hits the mark and most of u realize what a feminist should do and what she shouldnt.\nNow be silent and bring me a beer and my house shoes :) j/k relax and have a nice day im done with this",

Anyways, I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read, especially when it could be an opposing view!",

Of course people have different ideas of what equal is too. If you read this article you can see that some feminists wanted to be able to work, but with special considerations in mind for <b> woman.</b> BUT other feminists disagreed, saying that wouldn't be equal, and so there was back and forth there. Feminism is a group, but even groups can fight inside themselves about which is the right direction to turn, because it's made up of people with their own opinions. Personally, I approved of the equal part and not special considerations, and I think of myself as a feminist. I've posted links that show how feminism has improved the lives of two genders...if you'd like to read them, I think it shows the good of having feminism. But who cares what you call a movement as long as it's helping people?",

Way more money then their male counter parts so I'm tired of hearing how these adds are degrading to women when these female models would kill to be the one who's in their bra n panties posing in these adds.. So please I've had enough of everyone's feminist rhetoric..

I get that this can be a touchy subject and it's easier to read people in the most aggressive way when you don't have physical social cues to respond to.\n\nYou aren't talking to Aether you're talking at them. It is as disrespectful as you feel they have been.\n\nSo the subject of the wage gap. I think what Aether is getting at is that the conversation on the wage gap has ended far too easily.\n\nWomen make less money than men on the whole. Statistics often brought into the conversation are outdated and inaccurate. They talk about how women make around 30 cents per hour less than men, or something around that number for the same job. This statistic is not really representative of the real problem.\nWe are given reasons for why the wage gap occurs 'organically.' Women are less likely to ask for raises and tend to pick less physically intensive jobs. Most people take this and end the conversation there. But that's not where the conversation ends.\nThe next step is to question why that is. There's no real reason to assume that this is a biologically inherent tendency in women. It is very much possible that our culture's concept of women and how we socialize them plays a bigger role. There does exist outliers who do pursue raises and who do the more physically intensive job. Their existence does indicate that there's more at play than just biology.\n\nWomen absolutely should be encouraged to assess their value and ask for the appropriate amount. Women _do _have less initiative, but I don't think it's because of something physically or psychologically inherent to their <b> gender.</b> Our culture simply doesn't encourage that kind of behavior in women. And it's a problem.\nIt's not the only problem. But it is certainly one nonetheless.",

Although, what you said seems contradictory to me. Encouraging one <b> gender </b>and not the other is sexist. But men are encouraged to pursue asking for raises. So that is exactly where the<b>  sexism</b> lies...? So why the response to that part? You're already in agreement?\n\nI disagree that the wage gap is 'what you would expect.' And I don't particularly like the sentiment because it shuts down all curiosity on the subject. It says 'We shouldn't explore this further because it's obvious.' But it's not obvious. What you stated was speculation with an immensely simplified reasoning. But people are incredibly complex. If it really was as simple as that then there would be no women in more strenuous jobs. The fact that there are shows that it is at least in part nurture that plays a role in how women choose the jobs they pursue. To what degree, we don't know. So we need to ask and we need to explore.",

Actually, those ads might be vintage by American standards, but their messages are still prevalent in the values and norms of many other countries in the world today. I wish Buzzfeed would have people who have been exposed to such cultures participate more in their reaction videos. I feel like all the participants in Buzzfeed videos are really liberal and have a narrow viewpoint of the world. Considering Buzzfeed itself does aim to promote liberal interests I suppose it is to be expected, but I would appreciate them more if they presented broader perspectives.",

( that you can only kill males in the game) second not as many people would buy the game.. so why would they? isnt this suppose to be a free country?\u00a0\nif you dont like the add dont look at it, or better yet, look at it and never buy the product the add is for. if its a really bad add, than the add will not work and that company will go out of business",

            "commentText": "I mean, its okay to make fun of white men, since they have it 'sooooo easy'. Let's step back. Now, look at recent years. How often do you see the saying that \"white men have it easy\"? I see it too often. Now with that, let's back it up a bit more, and talk about men in general. Now we have the saying \"men have it easy\", along with \"tell men not to rape\", and plenty of other feminism sayings that are to criticize men in general. \n\nFeminism is very relatable to Nazism, honestly. Why? I have seen in multiple comment threads and on social medias, that 'Feminism gave you .....', and 'feminism is about equality for all', when in reality, it isn't. Egalitarianism is for equality of people, not women in general, like feminism. Look up the definition of both. And before someone goes 'all feminists I know say that they are for equality of men and women', which would not make them feminists. Why? I see so many feminists fall back onto the definition, and say 'how can you be against that?'.\n\n\nNow I know women were the inferior <b> gender </b>in history, and I understand why you'd think feminism has given women so many rights, when in reality, it was the suffragist movement. What's that, you may ask? You might as well do research. \n\n\nI'm not a stupid man who is against feminism because of (insert bullshit reason feminist would say here), I'm against it because I did my research on it, positive and negative, and I see that it is negatively affecting me more than it is positively affecting me. \n\nMen do not have it as easy as feminists say we do, in today's time and<b>  age</b>. Its plain and simple. Men are not gifted everything on a golden platter, its not that simple, as much as I wish it was. I need to work just as hard as you do for a job, for an education, for respect, etc. This world is not a mans world, it is a persons world. We are all running it, not just on<b> e gende</b>r.",

Guys are advertised to be \"hot\", tall, athletic, buff, and to have money... I practically have none of these. Women have the same issue, given more attention<b>  than s</b>exism towards men, women had more sexist tension, but as I view today it's about the same.",

Everybody keeps saying down in the comments that all of the offended men are about to shoot this down, but honestly there was <b> nothing </b>against men in this video. This was purely about how women were seen as less back then (and somewhat now), not how \"men are<b>  pigs</b>.\" BUT... To the people that thin<b> k misandr</b>y is a productive way of moving feminism forward, think about it. By suggesting that all men a<b> re nothi</b>ng but misogynists and hating them, you would only be setting back the progress we've made so far. Feminism is about the equal rights and opportunities for women and men. It's not about superiority of <b> one </b>sex. It's not about getting even with anybody who set women back majorly. It's about equality. I'm very sorry for all of the oppression that society has done to women in the past, but we are moving forward! So stay strong, love, and treat people equally! <3",

There have been court rulings sexist against men and women. also, if there were any biases of women getting the child, it's because the men in the law system still think that women are better caretakers, which, they're not, clearly, as there are a lot of abusive women out there too. men can actually be wonderful parents, and I have read stories about single dads that give up everything for their kids.\n\n\nalthough what disgusts me even more is while I'm not a feminist per-say, there are \"anti feminist\" women out there who still think a woman's place is in the kitchen. if we as a society stopped thinking that femininity and women were some how sub par, maybe women who are murderers could start being in equal lawful trouble as their male counterparts. certainly someone who is able to commit such a terrible crime as murder is note someone who is weak or needs to be doted upon.\n\n\nhowever, I digress that there seems to be a bit of a bias towards men about how people see men to be more likely to be criminals, which is largely untrue.",

So women may not be drafted, but they weren't even allowed to help. They could be nurses, but that's it. Women worked hard in the past to get rights while men had everything handed to them. Not gonna start a debate or anything, and I'm not saying that men didn't have to work hard. Men did HAVE to fight in wars even though sometimes they didn't want to, and they did basically run the world which is hard work, but getting rights for women in a male dominated world took a lot of hard work and we should all just appreciate the fact that we are all here now and we are alive and well ;3",

If you label yourself a feminist, you assume that men are privileged and have more rights and opportunities than women, but this is not the case. There are areas of life wherein women have more rights and opportunities than men. Neither side is more privileged than the other, but both sides have rights and opportunities the other does not. For example, men lack reproductive rights that women are entitled to. A <b> woman </b>can abort a fetus if she chooses, even if the man is opposed to it. However, a man cannot force a<b>  woman</b> to have an abortion if he doesn't want it for whatever reason. Is the fetus not the property of both parents? What does it matter whose body it's in? Sinilarly, men are paid slightly more than women are for the same work. Now, there are several factors that go into this, but what many believe to be the wage gap (.77 : 1) is not the wage gap. That study was conducted by a faulty organization that ignored many factors including the fact that men, on average, work 7% longer than women, earning them overtime which is pay-and-a-half. Also, many women go on maternity leave and after a certain period of time, that PTO switches to LTD which is unpaid or paid at a reduced rate. And what's most important to understand is that this study observed total wages which means that they added all the money earned by women and all the miney earned by men and looked at the difference, ignoring all the factors that went into that difference. At the end of the day, women AND men are unequal in many ways. No one side is more privileged than the other and it is important that we address inequality facing BOTH sexes/genders.",

You'll be hard-pressed to find a definition that coincides with the feminist belief that feminism means <b> gender </b>equality. However, that definition does wxist and many others do as well. So it's irrelevant to the conversation on whether or not feminism is a good thing.

If you put it into context, the ad makes complete sense with social attitudes (and this whole issue raising the question of what equality actually is). Your question as to why women having the same rights as men is flawed in its premise. You're assuming that women are still in this struggle for equality, when research and data shows that being a <b> woman </b>is far easier this day in<b>  age</b> than being a man. From the feminization of the education system and the listing of women as a minority so they get Affirmative Action to quotas being pursued by feminist groups and their political lobbyists. The problem is that having the same rights and equality are not the same thing. For instance, men and women have every single right given to them by the Constitution, local, state, and federal law, so they have the same rights, but men and women are unequal in that men are required to sign up for the draft when they register to vote when women don't have to. So when you say what's wrong with men and women having the same rights, there's absolutel<b> y nothin</b>g wrong with that, but equality is the most troubling subject. So, when you revise the question of whether or not men and women should be equal, I say of course, but you don't see feminists fighting for equality do you, but rather women's rights. This is the most egregious flaw in feminism, it is not a movement for equality, but for women's rights, and in an era where women have more rights and more protected rights than men, the movement becomes superfluous, a cancer of society and a victory for ignorance and stupidity.",

You don't have to be able to eat off the kitchen floor (unless you have a baby crawling around) and you don't have to be able to drink out of the toilet bowl. To me, piling my dirty socks in the corner is a fine place to store them until wash day, but to others? OMFG the horror ...the horror...As a buddy of mine once said to me: hey, the sock fairy must have died because my socks aren't magically whisked into the laundry hamper\" right before his wife swatted him.\n\nMy problem is I have a terrible short term memory. Always has been this way. So if I put something \"away\", I'll promptly never be able to find it again because I'll forget where \"away\" is. I lived with a stuffer, a YL who didn't care where it went, as long as it was out of sight. The problem with that was, I never knew where anything was.\n\nI think the issue is when dissimilar people get together. You both have to be \"ok\" with the pile of socks in the corner. Me? I just have one laundry basket for dirty clothes, one for clean. I work construction so my T shirts don't have to be folded and ironed, they're just going to get dirty and wrinkled 2 minutes after I hit the job site so I'm ok with rooting around in the clean laundry basket for one. WHen there's no more? Time to do laundry (and I have enough for 3 weeks). If a <b> woman </b>can't handle my system, then she shouldn't be with me or should learn to accept it. Or weigh it against the many positive things about me and decide whether it is a deal breaker or not.\n\nI know the title of the book is supposed to be funny, but \" I love you, you're perfect, now change\" is very apt. I find that women especially, over look these little things when they're dating but as soon as the wedding bells are finished ringing, the story is completely different. Kind of like when I hear a<b>  woman</b> say \"I'm tired of picking up his dirty socks for 30 years\"...well, no one asked you to in the first place.....",

That's why we females love you!\nThe majority of ads are aimed at women because advertisers know that far more than 50% of shopping is done by women.\nThey often do virtually all of the buying for themselves, their children, their mates and frequently their parents. With women having soo much purchasing power it only makes sense to gear the majority of ads toward them.\nEven many purchases made by men are influenced by the women in their lives. And while the commercials shown in this video are offensive to most in today's world it's important to remember that 20 years from now what we see as normal in advertising will be considered horrid. We grow ,we learn, we change :)\nEdit: \"That's why we females love you!\"\u00a0 is in error\nShould Read: That's one of the reasons some of us females love you!\n[Doing it this way so there is no confusion about what i changed]",

But I've literally only heard this term used today in the 'tumblr language'. I've heard the term \"whore\" for as long as I can remember, hell, I learned about in history class. Whore has been exploited and over used for centuries. I've only heard Fuckboy in this century. When someone calls a male fuckboy, and they react 'harshly' from it, it's a \"mean thing and men should have no right to be called it\" and people are okay with it. But when a Women reacts 'harshly' to being called a whore (just like a man would from being called a fuckboy) they are categorized as on there period or over-reacting. The point is that both terms should not be used and humans should respect each other enough to acknowledge that there standing points in society is equal. If you haven't looked around were all humans, we all have bones in our body, cells in our skin, and a functioning Brain that can tell what a human is.",

The rights to challenge false rape accusations. I didn't fare too well. She filed because she didn't like me. The DNA test brought shame on her family but before then everyone had her back. You're deranged. What rights do women need? Let me eliminate some stupid ones. The pink tax: They cost a lot of money because, through study, women have been shown to care more about appearance. So raise the prices. Women need Tampons and pads. RAISE THE PRICES. It's business, not discrimination. \"Women need more representation in those companies then\". Women are running those companies. They don't give a shit about the cost because they make money and the higher ups get to take home free products. Women are fucking you over on Tampon prices. Abortion: That's humanitarian, they're working out the paperwork as we type. Jobs: If you're not fit for the job, they won't hire you. Also, dress for it. Wear what they want you to wear. You are there because you need them, dress the way they want. I'll hire a <b> woman </b>before a man if she's more qualified. Don't cry and complain if\u00a0they don't get hired when they only have a degree in<b>  gender</b> studies. Finally, learn to accept what other people say. If someone triggers you, BOO FUCKING HOO, move on. \"More women need to go into science\". Women's rights activists already said that they don't want to go into science because it's generally not female friendly. YOU BE THE FIRST THEN.\u00a0Be the example other women want to follow. YOU, make that field more female friendly by doing it. Women aren't in it because they don't want to be. It amazes me how I tell a lot of women this stuff and they immediately go hostile towards me. I'm not against women, I'm against morons who make false claims about what women really need. Work to better both genders not just your own. We're all working together to make an awesome party.

What you're claiming a feminist is is actual a misandrist so please get your terminology right & do not base a movement off of what you see individual feminists do as claiming that you're a feminist doesn't mean you are one if you're sexist, just because someone says they are, and is actually a misandrist, doesn't mean all feminists are, because that person would in fact not be a feminist. Also I can see where you're coming from in terms of radical feminism but if you actually took the time to be a real feminist & try to make things better in terms of equality or at least teach people about it rather than making uneducated comments, maybe we'd have less of an argument here. Oh & not forgetting menimists, I understand that it is a satire, but should be called a satire in relation to radical feminism or something because people who claim to be menimists joke by saying \"not all men are like that\" & things, claiming that the <b> sexism </b>doesn't exist or we are already equal when we are not which is definitely not feminism turned on it's head because feminism is not about that with women. And although it is meant to be a joke, it is both damaging to the movement in creating negativity towards it, more people thinking it's like menimism but for females, & some people also don't see it as a joke & are using it as an excuse to be sexist which should not be ignored. Last of all I know the word feminism comes across as only helping women by the name & to an extent I agree, as in a way it you be called something to do with equality, however the reason it is called that is because generally women have always been the 'weaker'<b>  sex</b> & the movement is to make things better for women in terms of becoming equal with men, NOT surpassing them. Through that idea of equality feminists would also help men though. However I do agree that it isn't the greatest of terms for use especially since people constantly assume they know what it is because they are too lazy to use google, especially since not all women identify as feminine so should therefore be something mor<b> e gende</b>r neutral as females who don't identify as feminine may also need the same help as women who do, not to mention trans & non binary people, so I guess that's something we can agree on. But basically, know the difference between a feminist & misandrist, don't base your opinion of an entire movement on individual members of the movement as they may not be an accurate representation of the movements values, and menimism is a sexist & damaging joke that should not be encouraged. If anyone takes the time to read this which I highly doubt, thank you.",

You're using that as an argument but in the unlikely event that were both on a ship that's sinking, or we're both in a hostage negotiation, guess who gets to leave first?  It's like I'm immune to drowning and bullets now. I'm not saying that they should be paid less,  but if you're in a position at work where you get paid less then your male counterpart, you should quit because it's very unlikely that you're getting paid less at most places of work. I want to also \"rant\"  on layla bell's argument.  In the beginning I agreed with what you were saying how equalist is a better word for feminist because it can't be misinterpreted as anything else,  and yes I understood what they were saying was a joke,  but a joke can still be sexist and you could tell that that was in fact how they really thought of men. Later down the line you straight out insulted Ip1kachul when all he was trying to do was interpret what you were saying, and he kind of had a point too. Because he brought up how you said that feminists should only solve women's problems, he also brought light upon your NAACP argument, because equalists claim to be for equality for everyone but NAACP never once claimed to be for everyone.  And then later you claimed \"actually feminism in my mind is not about <b> gender </b>equality\" this is where you really start to abandon your original statements. Yes,  there isn't anything wrong with women fighting to help women,  but when women start to take away rights of men then they are just proving that they are not equalists they are not feminists either, they're actually pretty sexist. Most men don't complain about how there's a video directed at women, they complain because those video are actually pretty sexist towards men, whether they be joking or not. Your argument has collapsed upon itself. You have to stop contradicting the previous things you've said or your entire argument just becomes invalid.",

                    "commentText": "@bbomg02 If we're being honest, then let's be honest about this: yes, men are under pressure to conform to expected norms... BUT, men are also validated and celebrated for kicking those norms to the curb. This shows leadership potential, individuality, strength of character, stuff like that. Being offbeat can be cool.\u00a0\n\nAnd the norms men are pressured to conform to are different. Men are expected to be assertive, opinionated, and in control, while women are expected to be patient, subtle, and docile. Do you see how one set of norms is more conducive to, I don't know, making all the laws and deciding all the rules, while the other is conducive to complying? \n\n\nThere's also the fact that the <b> gender </b>norms women are expected to conform to are generally negative. Girls are supposed to look beautiful at all times, but any girl who pays attention to her appearance is shallow and vain. You can't win! Either you're criticized for not complying, or you're criticized for trying to comply. \n\n\nMen are given a lot more slack-- it's like people realize that the Fabio muscles look is mostly impossible to achieve, and no one in their right mind should be forced to. Look at TV--  male comedians with their own sitcoms are<b>  fat</b> and middle-aged, but their wives are played by stunningly beautiful actresses who are usually a few years younger. A man can still be successful even if his looks aren't his best attribute, but <b> a woma</b>n usually stops getting work in show biz after she starts aging visibly. Maggie Gyllenhaal, at 37, is considered t<b> oo o</b>ld to play the lover of a 55-y<b> ear-</b>old actor. \n\n\nAnd if you're an equal rights activist, you're a feminist. They are the exact same thing. I don't know why men have to call it \"equal rights,\" unless it's to avoid offending other men. Calling it \"equal rights\" doesn't work-- the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) still hasn't passed.\n\n\n The truth is that everyone benefits from feminism-- part of feminism means rejecting \"toxic masculinity,\" rejecting the idea that men can't show emotions or have feelings, rejecting the idea that, to be MANLY, they must be tough and shoot things and so forth. The reason men are looked down on for liking more feminine things is because that thing is considered feminine. Men wouldn't have so much pressure put on them to confor<b> m to ge</b>nder norms",

Because mine was two hours ago, and I live in and incredibly safe neighborhood. I just don't live in a safe society. Men have generally more physical strength, and are generally more 'visual' than women, and instead of teaching boys that their strength is not something you use to make a <b> woman </b>give you what you want or that your eyes aren't allowed to roam places they haven't been given permission, we spend our time telling girls it's their fault where the boys look and and that boys will be boys. We spend so much more time teaching women to shut up and deal with  it than we do teaching men to get some self control and respect for those around them. This video is allowing women to to speak about the things we as a culture enable men to do to us, and to show you guys that the way you have been taught to treat us is not alright on the receiving end. So no, it's not about being quiet about men being assaulted, it's about being loud about the assault of women, and those are not the same thing.",

But I also understand that being a provider and acting a certain way is something we have ingrained in our DNA, so we tend to think that we should behave like that in modern times.\n\n\nThis is not about \"who has it worse\" or \"I suffer more than you\". This is about acknowledging that everyone has problems and instead of focusing on downplaying the other side we should be working on making things better for everyone. Anyone who says that \"I have it worse\" thing cannot see the bigger picture of all of this, be it male or female.\n\n\nEven having said that, <b> sexism </b>is not as rampant as these people want to make you believe. Yeah, there are sexist people, but there will always be, the same way there will aways be racists, homophobes, xenophobes, religious fanatics, etc. But the good part about this is that they really don't hold any power anymore, everyone (at least in this side of the planet) is free to decide what to do with their lives, be it male or female. To say that<b>  sexism</b> holds you down as an individual is childish, \"you hold yourself down\" not anyone else, it's up to you to decide to listen to those people. For example, I could blame my inability to get a higher paying job o<b> n racis</b>m, being that I'm mexican, but I don't, because I know that it's because of me, not other people.\n\n\nI went on a bit of a rant here, I just don't like people blowing out of proportion their problems, usi<b> ng sexi</b>sm as an excuse or trying to make their problems to be more important than those of other people.",

Of course, if you just pick some aspects of how society worked, you'll find that women had it worse. But if you pick others, you'd find the contrary. When the Titanic sank, men stayed on the boat so that women and children would live. That definitely is NOT what oppressors would do to someone they do not consider at least as valuable as themselves, if not more.\n\nThere have been extremely misogynistic societies, notably part of the ancient greeks, where men dreamed of reproduction without the need of women. Well at least part of it. But ancient minoan culture had women treated pretty much as equals from what we know.\n\nIn general though the trend was to give different rights to men or women, but most importantly, those differences were <b> nothing </b>compared to social classes.

It's not like women are the people making up the ads and saying that they want to sexualize themselves. Ads are made in this order: the media decides to make an ad in which a women is sexualized, then the ad agency hires the actors. The actor doesn't get to decide how they will be portrayed in the ad. People that need jobs will take them and even if one <b> woman </b>refuses to be sexualized for an ad there will probably be another one who needs the money. The root of the problem is that the way society is now, ads sexualizing women are okay and are even considered effective in selling products and that's not right; women posing for<b>  sexual</b> photoshoots are just byproducts of that. Trying to stop the sexualization of women by attacking the women that poses for those kinds of ads is like trying to plug up a hose with a tissue.",
