        "postText": "The white police officer convicted of shooting dead her unarmed black neighbour was hugged by both the judge and her victim\u2019s brother as she was jailed for 10 years.', 'Amber Guyger, 31, was found guilty of murdering Botham Jean after claiming she mistook him for an intruder after walking into his apartment thinking it was her own.', 'But while supporters outside court raged at the light sentence, Botham\u2019s 18-year-old brother Brandt asked the judge if he could give Guyger a hug.', 'In an extraordinary act of compassion the teenager walked over in front of the bench and held the weeping defendant after telling her: \u2018I love you as a person. I don\u2019t wish anything bad on you.\u2019', 'Judge Tammy Kemp also stepped down to hug the victim\u2019s mother before presenting Guyger with a Bible and similarly embraced her before sending her off to begin her sentence.', 'The shooting in September last year drew widespread attention in the wake of a string of shootings of unarmed black men by white police officers.', 'Guyger was arrested three days after the shooting and later fired.', 'She was convicted of murder on Wednesday by a jury largely composing women and people of colour who could have sent her to prison for life.', 'Prosecutors asked for a 28-year term \u2013 which would have reflected Botham\u2019s age had he been alive.', 'As it stands, she will be eligible for parole in just five.', 'The judge\u2019s decision to hug the killer received mixed reactions.', 'Online critics blasted it as inappropriate, while worshippers at the church frequented by the Jean family applauded the footage.', 'Demonstrators marched through parts of downtown Dallas to protest the sentence, leading to one arrest.', 'Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot, a former trial judge, called it \u2018an amazing act of healing and forgiveness that is rare in today\u2019s society \u2026 especially for many of our leaders\u2019.', 'The city\u2019s mayor, Eric Johnson, issued a statement saying he would \u2018never, ever forget the incredible examples of love, faith and strength personified by Botham, Brandt and the entire Jean family\u2019.', 'Botham\u2019s father told jurors about how his son swapped St Lucia for college in Arkansas and described how he would call home every Sunday after church to catch up with the tightly knit family.', 'Now, he said, his Sundays \u2018have been destroyed\u2019.', '\u2018How could we have lost Botham? Such a sweet boy. He tried his best to live a good honest life. He loved God. He loved everyone. How could this happen to him?\u2019 the father said, breaking into tears.', 'After the hearing, Botham\u2019s mother, Allison Jean, criticized the investigation into her son\u2019s death and the police training to shoot to kill.', 'If Guyger \u2018was trained not to shoot in the heart, my son would be alive today. He was no threat to her. He had no reason to be a threat to her, because he was in his own apartment\u2019, she said.', 'The basic facts of the shooting were not in dispute. Guyger, returning from a long shift that night, parked on the wrong floor and mistook Jean\u2019s apartment for her own, which was directly below his.', 'Finding the door ajar, she entered and shot him, thinking he was a burglar.', 'He had been eating a bowl of ice cream before she fired.', 'In the frantic 911 call played repeatedly during the trial, Guyger said \u2018I thought it was my apartment\u2019 nearly 20 times.', 'Her lawyers argued that the identical physical appearance of the apartment complex from floor to floor frequently led to tenants going to the wrong apartments.', 'But prosecutors questioned how Guyger could have missed numerous signs that she was in the wrong place.', 'They also asked why she did not call for backup and suggested she was distracted by sexually explicit phone messages she had been exchanging with her police partner, who was also her lover.",

That said, when you do shoot somebody in their own apartment it's still cold blooded murder, so their system is partly to blame, but this lady should serve the same time as any civilian committing these crimes and the hug's in court make me sick frankly.",
