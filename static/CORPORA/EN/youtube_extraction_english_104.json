Here is why I think so.\n\nI live in an area in Arizona that is just surrounded by older drivers (65+) and when the snowbirds (Snowbirds - older people escaping the snow where their main home is) come down I am almost terrified for my life some days, I've watched several wrong way drivers (80% of the time it's the older generation), crashes, and just several other scary incidents because they are not fully aware of some of the road rules, as in round about, yeild signs, and others. \nAnd on the other hand I've seen a few older people that are in their 90s it looks like and they drive just as safely and aware of what's going on around them as other drivers in their younger years. \n\nNot everyone should have their licenses taken away. If we could start a petition to do this retest of the drivers license, it would be much safer on the road for everyone.\n\nI understand that even 30s as you said we're just as likey to crash or cause accidents as an 80 yea<b> r ol</b>d but there is only so much anyone can do. And as he said in the video I agree that there should be stricter driving restrictions.\n\nHopefully we can make something happen to have a safer time driving from A to B and so forth.",

If you look at this chart  [LINK]  you can see that there are significantly less 75+ drivers than 25-29 drivers. This is from 2008 but you can extrapolate to 2019 and not expect a huge difference in numbers. So, what i'm saying is, older people probably are far more likely to have an accident, relative to the same number of young people. Love the videos!

I recently received a car on trade from an 87 year<b>  old</b> it was an 08 Accord with 37k miles. He said he wanted his last car to be a luxury dream car that we had. As we got ready to go on the test drive the car all of the sudden revved up. It felt like it hit 6500 rpm. He was like whoops wrong one. I was so shook we didn't leave the parking lot. Does the charts from AAA consider how much driving the older drivers actually do?  A person in their 30s would be most likely commuting every day to their jobs 10,000 to 15,000 miles a year. A person in their 75+ would most likely be going to their grocery shopping on Sunday morning 5,000 to 8,000 miles a year.",

Grandpa don drinks too much, has diabetes and cant feel his feet, has trouble getting both in/out of vehicle and also getting inside without falling. My grandma however is even worse, takes 30 plus pills a day, half of which are opioid painkillers and thats just the tip. She cant see and drives in the middle of the road at night cause \"the center line is the only thing she sees\". Her little car has 13,000 km on it!! and has been in more minor accidents and in the ditch more times than i can count. Ive had to grab the wheel and steer us out of the ditch, or out of the path of an oncoming big rig, and take over driving in general when she cant park and has a panic attack. Speaking of panic attacks, i have an uncle who is a nervous driver, and will do stupid shit like hold the ebrake when winter driving instead of the gear shifter and will end up sideways skidding off the road or into a snowbank when somebody way ahead lightly taps the brakes. He will go 80 in a 110 because he doesnt feel safe going over 80. In my opinion it should be a persons overall health, physical an<b> d menta</b>l that makes the decision. Both G ma and G pa used to be good drivers, but i refuse to drive with them now unless im behind the wheel, i dont have a license, but im good enough that i definetly wont kill us or get pulled over for any reason in any weather...",

She also rammed my grandfather's car. There are a lot of roads in my area that are wide enough for a tractor and somehow they're two ways, and she will not stop for anyone on these roads. Puts a lot of people into a ditch.

This impedes traffic and is inherently more dangerous to driving, as we've seen in research stressing the efficiency of left to pass, right to travel. Combined with deteriorating reaction times potential vision and health issues, I'd say retest em every other year after 65. If that's<b>  ageist</b>, than make 16-65 retake the test every 5 years. I know for a fact I would pass, and it would most certainl<b> y thi</b>n out the idiots on the road. Do we need stricter driving requirements in the US? Absolutely, but older drivers need more scrutiny as much as driving in general does. This would also potentially allow for a relaxation of policing if there is higher confidence that the people that are licensed are competent and safe.",

Honestly, half the people on the roads today shouldn't have passed the driving test, not just the <b> elderly </b>but everyone of all ages, in my experiences on the road. \n\n\nI like the act of driving, even though I have a boring '09 Subaru Forester that's automatic with about 150hp if I remember right. But holy shit I hate actually driving because of just how stupid people are on the road. 3/4 of the people I see on the road are on their fucking phones. 1/8th are people who are too<b>  old</b> to see 50ft in front of them, and the remaining 1/8th are ok drivers.\n\n\nReally, we need to ban stupid drivers, and, I don't know... maybe have a test that a retarded sloth couldn't pass, instead of how it is now. When I took the test, all I had to do was parallel park in a large space, and drive around a quiet street for about 10 mins. I think we need a tougher test.",

I didn't have to do a 3 way turn or parallel park or anything that really should be tested before you get your license. Not too sure how it goes in other states but i can say that in Oregon we got the biggest idiots on the road and the older folks are always turning without a turn signal, braking super hard when they have 2 car lengths to the car in front while were going 30 mph. Not all <b> old </b>people are like this but he majority i see do these things (and believe me i see a lot of drivers on a daily basis since i'm a delivery driver) so i would say we definitely need annual testing per year after people hit 70. I also realize i will hit that<b>  age</b> some day and I 100% would still agree that we need annual testing when i hit tha<b> t ag</b>e, not because i think ill be one of those idiots on the roads but because i know plenty of people right now that are <b> my a</b>ge that shouldn't be driving and as they get older its just gonna get worse.",

You gotta divide by average distance travelled at these <b> age </b>ranges.\n\nThe real scandal is that the only time anyone ever does this is when figuring out how much insurance you should pay. Drive a ton? You better drive slow a ton, because your probability of getting flashed goes up the more miles you drive. This is why taxi drivers only ever drive fast in cities. They don't put speed traps up in cities, only stationary cameras, which they know all the locations of. on the motorway they drive like an angel because they will rack up those points 3-6x faster than a typical person by virtue of being on the road more.\n \nWith regards to the kill-death ratio of the oldies-but-rollies, they only ever drive to the shops, where they're killing as many people as 30yo who drive all over. Thats the issue Roland. Go with your gut. Seize their means of locomotion. For their own good. or whatever. Shit by the time i'm 80 my car will drive itself.",

I mean, speed doesn't cause accidents itself, you can crash at half a mph, but on some parts of roads, you could go 160mph and be perfectly fine if your car is safe to do so. But most cops just blame speed to call it a day, or drivers who were at fault, just to save face. Being the 31 year <b> old </b>I am, I have never crashed because I train myself, even though I live in a place that has snow 8 months of the year, and that's because I do donuts in the snow and train myself, and I've gotten myself out of what could've been bad crashes. But I do have noticed differences from when I was 20, so I constantly test my self and take yearly trips to the eye doctor. Love my 335i and constantly floor it for the feeling, but only when completely safe to do so!",

It may have been on dirt and country roads, but you get use to a car that much earlier. I think better driving education is extremely important considering, at least in the US, cars are very much a big part of day to day life especially when in many places public transportation just isn't good enough. I'd like to see more like what Finland does with their driving education and tests.",

            "commentText": "I've actually talked about this at length with many people. I do agree with Nolan that we should just have stricter requirements for getting a license in the first place. It's laughably easy for most competent people. \n\nI would advocate for a practical driving exam for everyone every 5-6 years. Let's face it, we all know tons of terrible drivers regardless of <b> age.</b> Forcing people to actually retake the practical exam is important since people don't ever have to take it again after they pass it the first time, except for the written exam if you move to another state. Then you bump that up to every 2 years after a certain<b>  age</b>, probably 65 then every year after maybe 70 or 75. The sobering fact of the matter is, human beings just weren't meant to live as long as we do. We extend our lives well past our general expiration point due to medical science but at the cost of our cognitive and physical abilities.\n\nI know this is extremely controversial for many reasons. The primary being, driving seems like a general right that everyone should have an<b> d nobod</b>y would want their right to drive taken away from them when they g<b> et o</b>ld. But many of us forget that driving is NOT a right, it's a privilege. Driving is a dangerous thing that can kill you and others on the road. \nThe other reason that it's so controversial is because many older people view driving is one of the final things that they can do autonomously. Even when their health begins to degrade and they can't walk or run like they used to, they can at least still drive. But their need to feel that freedom puts the lives of everyone else at risk.\n\nThe problem with data like Nolan used is that it isn't the whole picture. Sure they might not be more fatal than ot<b> her </b>age groups but they are certainly more detrimental. We don't just label fast and reckless driving as dangerous. Police give tickets for people driving too slowly too. That is because it impedes traffic and creates dangerous situations that may force other people to drive more recklessly in order to avoid them.",

My bet? There are more 25 year olds on the road to create a skewed accident margin, more of them on the road means more opportunities for accidents, and the reverse of it being true for the 80 year olds. Using the idea that there would be fewer 80 year olds on the road (cuz the general population may not get tha<b> t ol</b>d) I bet 80 year olds cause a higher number of accidents per capita within th<b> at a</b>ge range.  \nRegardless, I am very much Pro-Testing of the hig<b> her </b>age range, even going so far as to say I'd prefer to be tested every few years myself as a mid<b> -20s w</b>oman.

It's safer to drive surrounded by drunk 20 year olds than by sober 80 year olds.\n<b> Elder </b>drivers caused less deaths and injuries on the road just because they are fewer than those in their 20s and 30s. We do have regulations for speeding, taking drugs and<b>  alcohol</b>, typical young behaviours that cause most accidents, but we need regulations for elders, cuz our population is aging and they are a serious danger on the road, even if they are not drunk or high, just for bein<b> g ol</b>d.\nMy wife is a psychologist who gets people tested, but tests are just not strict enough. Many people over 80 or even 90 pass their tests easily even if they are slow to think, can barely move or stand on their feet. She had to deny ma<b> ny eld</b>er's permissions just for observation cuz they passed the test buy they were still a very obvious hazard to anyone out there on the road.\nEdit: the <b> top </b>age should be 80 btw, it's generous enough, many people die of a heart arrest or a brain stroke much earlier, things that can randomly happen at any time of the day (for example, while driving) and there's no body over 75 agile enough to react to traffich stimuli as an average driver would.

Also I have done some trips with him and I must say that those where nice trips, he drove fast but safely, always braking in time, never reving too high and the shifting was smooth as silk sometimes without even pressing the clutch pedal.\nBtw he teached me how to drive when I was 12 and when he died, I got his car, I still drive it sometimes to keep it in shape and I get surprised everytime I make a repair, and see that he have repaired it with some strange stuff, like the throttle cable being atatched to the injection pump with a paper clip and one modification that I keep to this day, he had connected a ringer to the left blinker because he once forgot to turn it of and got a ticket and so he installed that ringer to prevent another one and I decided to keep it that way to honour him and everyone that ride the car with me like it because its quite funny",

Thus, when they retire and their annual driving drops from 20,000 per year down to 2,000, THE INSURERS STILL REPORT 20,000 TO THE STATISTICIANS.\n\nThe statisticians and media purveyors of their incompetent nonsense don't tell you that, huh?\n\nThus the damages PER MILES DRIVEN is wildly higher for older drivers.

            "commentText": "Quite well researched! I agree that what we really need is stricter requirements for getting and keeping a license. Getting a driver's license is stupidly easy - 15 minute drive on quiet side streets that only checks to see that you don't screw up royally. And then only once - I got my license at 16 and have never had any formal training (except for a somewhat disappointing \"skid camp\") since, and most drivers probably never will have any checks or training the rest of their life except maybe a quick vision test at the DMV. I have a pilot's license, and I think that's much better - much more involved to get it, and to stay legal one must fly with an instructor who signs off that they still have their stuff once every two years. I think that should be done in cars, make someone re-take the test - a more thorough test than we have now - periodically, maybe more frequently at an older <b> age.</b> That's really the only way to do it. Especially as aging varies so much person to person. This is true of kids growing up - I've seen 10 year olds with maturity better than many adults - but even moreso of elders, some shouldn't be driving at 60 while others are fine at 85. As for the perception that elders are bad drivers, I think that comes not from accidents but sharing the road with them. They often drive excessively slow, are oblivious to other drivers, and so on, in general are a nuisance. Crash likelihood alone isn't a good measure of if someone should or shouldn't be out on the road, their ability to decently cooperate with other drivers should also be a factor. The damage they cause in crashes is probably relatively low because - for good reason - they tend to drive slower, this doesn't mean they are a \"good\" or \"competent\" driver. One thought I've had is that if an<b>  elderly</b> driver is like such, they should have a bumper sticker saying<b>  \"elderl</b>y driver.\" I'd be much more patient with such <b> an eld</b>er - especially if they are conscientious of it - than a car going excessively slow for no apparent reason, and would know to give them a wide berth. Though certain manufacturer emblems, particularly the circle w<b> ith<b>  </b</b>>red, white, and blue shields (Buick) practically say this already...",

About 6 months ago my 96 year great grandfather still had his licence and a car. ( it was some kind of gray Subaru SUV) One night he went out to go to a casino like all great grandparents do. On the way back he managed to get lost and ended up in Wisconsin (he lives in Illinois)   but he did not get he licensed taken away until he did the exact same thing about a month later. thanks for reading and hope to see more good videos like this. =)",

When I was 16 I had a bicycle and I was going everywhere with that thing, for longer distances (which a 16 y/o might wanna go) I would've took bus or ask for a ride. I wanted a car, but just wanting it doesn't mean you're capable of controlling it.\n\nThat's just my opinion \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

If 20-40 YOs are driving 5-10 times the miles it would make sense that their accident average would be slightly higher, if only because they drive so much more and would then be more likely to be in an accident at some point. Also, that has to do with more than just capabilities. Factors such as stress, sleep or lack thereof, weather, time of day those miles are being driven, and so on should all be accounted for.

            "commentText": "\"Stricter license requirements across the board.\"\n\nI live in Hungary where in order to get a license you first need to do pass a question test and later on a driving test. If you fail you can pay for another try. You can pay to get access to various programs which should be able to help you to learn for the question test but everything falls apart when you learn that there are more than 11000 questions in total and you have to answer 55 of them. You can know everything about cars or how to drive on the road and still fail at the test.\n\nOne time I got a question about \"How the pedestrians should walk on bridges\" and the answer was that they can't walk in synchronized steps.. If only I'd make this up. \n\nYou need to reach 65 points out of 75. In the past months I did the test 8 times and failed every single time. There were 3 examples where I was 1-3 points away from passing the test. One test costs about 5000 HUF and at the start you have to pay 35000 HUF for a basic training. An average payout in Hungary is around 100-150k HUF in most of the states. \n\nOther than that I liked the video. Keep up the good work I love to watch the WheelHouse.",

I know plenty of people whose driving skills are terrible and they're in their 50's, while a lot of people in their 70's are excelent drivers.\nThe solution for this could be that whenever your license expires and you're on your way to get a new one you shouldn't be able to just go and grab a new license without any tests. Their physical and<b>  mental</b> health should be tested and they should take another driving exam where the examiner determines if they're healthy enough to drive the car safely. Sure it would cost more than it does now but it would be a lot safer.",

I am pretty sure a drivers course like that would give 16 - 18 ye<b> ar o</b>ld anxiety, but it would effectively change how safe we are on the road. I'm a firm believer in that a person going 10 over the speed limit is not as dangerous as a person going 10 under the speed limit. I'm also a firm believer in you should 'merge onto an on ramp' at the speed of the traffic you're merging, not at whatever speed you 'feel like' at that time (Ergo -- you shouldn't merge at 30 if traffic is going 60). I also believe teaching drivers how to properly drive in rain and snow (or rather, confirming the driver understands this before they actually are given a license) would effectively decrease the risk of accidents during weather-permitted times.\nAlthough the only state that would ever probably try this would be Cali (and I'd praise them for this), I believe that doing this would literally decrease the amount of accidents, next to actually placing a $400 minimum ticket on distracted driving, as we have in NYS.",

The whole attitude of drivers is just horrible, which leads to road rage and accidents.

Road laws change all the time and we have no real way of testing if people are up to scratch. My parents passed their test close to 50 years ago and so much has changed I bet they couldn't pass today's standard",

The only down side is he drives a bit too fast but he never had a crash before.  His reflexes are a bit slower but he had awesome reflexes to start with. Now he's a good example of a proper driver. \n\nOn the other hand, my father, by his late 50s was a danger on the road. My father relaxed too much and was not focused on the road. And he was too stubborn to realize it. I was not a bad driver, physiologically or technically but didn't have the right mindset.  Myself, I've seen sick for over a year with (prescribed) drug induced hepatitis and stop driving because I felt dizzy and my awareness was way off. I still drove for a couple of months but I realize now it was a stupid mistake that luckily didn't hurt anyone.\n\n<b> Age </b>should not be a limitation but physical measurable data should do that for you. Like my stepfather, I apparently have above average reflexes but I could be like my dad, lounging in my car instead of paying attention to the road and I would still be a terrible driver no matter the fact that I did my car and truck licences, on one go.\n\nBe honest about yourself and understand the damage you could do to others if not yourself.",

Every time a traffic light goes out in my area and people have to \"figure out\" in what order everyone gets to proceed, it's mayhem.

Speed/power tend to drop off first, followed by aerobic power and endurance, then strength.<b>  Mental</b> capacity degrades as well. But all of them can be partially offset by training, and your physiological prime isn't necessarily where you get peak performance. For instance, with strength athletes, even though you start losing some physical capacity for adaptation in your mid-twenties, they typically won't peak in their sport until later, because you can keep building muscle, albeit at a slower rate. Similarly with chess players, peak learning ability passes well before you see a dropoff in performance.  These effects are more pronounced with people who haven't been at peak performance their whole lives, and so you can see major improvements i<b> n elderl</b>y, previously sedentary people if they start exercising<b> .\n\nA</b>ge matters. That doesn't mean you're washed up and unable to accomplish anything at all when you hit 60, but by that point you can pretty much abandon the idea of becoming a leader in a field you're not already an expert in, and progress will generally be slower, or you might only be able to slow your decline.",

In the small town I live in my main office is 35+ minutes away, and the average distance one way to a bigger town is 30+ minutes. running buses several times a days like that gets very very expensive when you factor in the cost of fuel, paying a driver who has to have a CDL every year with a physical, the cost of the buses themselves along with their maintenance.  I'm lucky I get a single bus to pickup some of my clients, and bring them to and from my site, and we have gone through drivers like crap through a goose in the past few years simply because being a non profit we can't pay enough, to get a lot of things done around my site at work I have to pay for it out of pocket. If you don't believe me here is the website of the company I work for. Also to be known if there is a single topic this channel has covered I'm passionate about more than anything then this is it. \nhttps://www.aikensenior.org/\nedit: it should be know that most meals on wheels is volunteer work, and we have enough trouble trying to find volunteers at times to deliver our meal routes, so again with the need of having a CDL, and physical every year, then CPR classes,  plus the time of the person, so good luck in finding someone to do it as volunteer work for a bus route.",

On drop its 10 min on pick its 30-up to an hour - he blocks traffic and seats like zombie with 0 or minimal reaction on honking or when ppl ask him to park (most of the time there is ton of parking - he just cant park).\nAfter pick\u00a0he turns around on that road - takes forever and he doesn't paying attention at all - he just slowly turns looking all time only front like zombie.\n\nAnd finally - once after turn ,he rear-ended car in front ,a bit ,but then instead of brakes he slammed\u00a0full gas (for about 2 secs - did nice burnout)\u00a0,smashed - released - smashed with all force gas again - dropped pedal and then full gas again - on 4th time he finally found breaks.\nThey probably should've taken his license like 10 years ago... cause he can easily run someone over like that or even whole market - like dude in the video...",

I cover interstates and secondary roads sometimes as much as 90,000 miles in a year, and far and away,  it's people under 30 that I, and my Codriver see, jacking around with their cellphones. \n\nAnd I use a BlackVue 950 to maintain low insurance rates. The videos I have from the last ten years of driving with a dashcam, overwhelmingly show younger people using their phones while driving. \n\nI am a caregiver for my Grandparents, since they raised me, I figure it's the least I could do to repay their love and kindness.  It was one of the toughest things I ever had to do, to take away my Granddad's keys. But he started slipping at 88. Up til then,  he was a recognized very competent driver. He was also 82nd Airborne in WWII. \n\nOur elders deserve our respect and honor. They have literally made EVERYTHING POSSIBLE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE COME AFTER THEM. \n\nDECENCY and COMPASSION WILL be the order of the day, while my watch is on. My Granddad used to say that punks got their heads knocked together in his day, and Herbie,  wherever you are, you and Nolan will have a sound thrashing coming if you don't mind your manners in earshot of real Americans.\n\nWatch 'Secondhand Lions' with Robert Duvall and Michael Cain and you will see who these 'Old People' are, that you so carelessly dismiss.",
