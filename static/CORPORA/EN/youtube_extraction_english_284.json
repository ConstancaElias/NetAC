Also they very intentionally conflate anti-Israel State, through a highly structured lobby, with anti-Semitism with the express intention of smearing those that might dare to criticise their apartheid activities towards the Palestinians, amongst other nefarious actions. And this includes the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn. Criticising a government of any political persuasion is NOT rascist, and never has been! Just watch The Lobby (UK version), with secretly recorded footage of a guy\nworking out of the Israeli Embassy, if it hasn't been taken down yet.\n\n\nAbsolutely no-one should receive any kind of vilification for <b> race </b>or religion, but neither should this be weaponised!",

It's all a part of the \"Policical Correctness\" movement, designed to take over our thoughts and words, AND IT ISN'T GOING TO WORK !. It would be better to give up THAT tactic before words turn into deeds !.If a group of people act like ANIMALS, then others have a perfect right to call them Animals. It's that simple, and by the magic of the internet and other media forces, we have all witnessed the Animalistic behaviour of the Semites, both with their next door neighbours, the Palestinians, ( who are not themselves blameless), and the wider world with their behaviour in the fields of finance, war and population control. So it could be said that the Semites have brought public opinion and condemnation crashing down upon their own heads. I used to sympathise with the poor, downtrodden Jewish peoples, reviled and pushed from pillar to post throughout history.... BUT NOW I'M WISER and see them for what they are !. They have EARNED each and every derogatory name they get called. So, to anyone who THINKS that they can dictate the way we think and speak....DON'T....it will come back to haunt you.",

But some facts merit mention:\n\n* In the US, Steven Miller has been actively promoting the racialization of Central American asylum seekers, which is a head scratcher given  all  that's outlined in this article.  AIPAC has been  mute.  \n\n* David Frum just published an article in the Atlantic magazine arguing for the freezing of all US immigration.  Sounds like he's trying to confuse the public with the argument that will be used against the Palestinians' right of return. 'A country has the right to say no to immigration.'\n\n* US Neocons forced the Iraqi invasion/destruction, and in the process destabilizing the Middle Esast. Millions were displaced and millions have entered the Europe, while its economies have yet to recover from the 2008 US-driven economic recession\n\n* Netanyahu, US casino owner Sheldon Adelson et al engineered  Jerusalem's and most recently the Golan Heights land grab.    Concurrently, some media headlines have been arguing there has been no reaction to the announcement to legitimize it .  Really? \n\n* The Likud Party issued a manifesto announcing the unilateral appropriation of the occupied territories.  \n\n* Bob Rubin & friends eliminated the Glass-Steagall Act, which allowed 'Sandy Weill' to create a financial supermarket meant to stimulate market competitiveness.   The ensuing looting caused the 2008 Great Recession & destruction of  American families.",

Berger had no connection with Liverpool - she was a London New Labour Careerist, hand-picked by Blair. She now falls back on comfortable claim that the local CLP is anti-Semitic because they don't like her very much. She resigned from the Labour Party because she was about to be deselected. Berger's absurd line appears to be: 'If you don't vote for me you're an an anti-Semite'. Doesn't it occur to Ms Berger that all Palestinians are Semites? Yet she has not once spoken as an MP in the Commons about the slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza,  never once protested on the streets of London over, for example, the Israeli war on Lebanon, or the Israeli use of phosphorous bombs on the population of the West Bank. For Luciana it is all about: 'Poor me'.",

She would be taken more seriously if she herself also stopped the bullying. When you align yourself with loud mouthed bullies like John Mann and keep generating discontent and subversion within the Labour party you lose all credibility. She needs to calm down and get a grip.  She is not the only one who is targeted. Just look at how she has targeted, in the despicable way, the leader of the Labour Party.

That said, the Left,\u00a0which includes your own party, would gladly throw you under the bus if necessary because it's convenient, because their main support base really does despise you for no other reason than\u00a0the religious group to which you belong. On the other hand, the Right would\u00a0accept and embrace you\u00a0if you\u00a0supported unconditionally the right of\u00a0every country to preserve its culture and to protect its borders from mass immigration of people who are at best indifferent, or at worst hostile to the native people. And even if you\u00a0are a staunch supporter of Israel, the Right would still support you, so long as you concede that national interests supersede the interests of Israel and that Israel is now perfectly capable of fending for itself. Influential figures from\u00a0the \"Far Right\" have even said this explicitly time and time again. Please consider this!",

Read the comments in any hawkish Caroline Glick article, and you'll be able to spot them quickly.  This isn't really Breitbart's fault, since they censor far less than most news sites.  I personally prefer this to having perfectly sensible and thoughtful comments censored over algorithmic nonsense.   That being said, The Guardian's readership is far more hostile to Israel than anything in Breitbart and includes a ton of far-left agitprop types who regard Israel as a <b> racist,</b> colonialist endeavour whilst regarding Palestine (which is intended to be Judenfrei) as a righteous reclamation of indigenous people's land.

She was selected in 2010 under dubious circumstances and is paying lip service to her constituents because it is a safe seat. A donkey in Labour clothes would be voted in.",

I haven''t seen Dianne Abbott blubbing over the abuse that she gets. Oh I see it's OK to abuse Diane Abbott, but not Berger. Pass the sick bag vicar pleeeease!!!!! My uncle, a friends dad, and colleague of my father were all in the Palestinian police in the 40s and saw the massacre of Palestinians and murder of British soldiers by Zionists. That's terrorism for you. If she wants to support Israel instead representing the people of Liverpool then she should go and live there with Shirley Porter.",

I have listened to her and thought she was a very charismatic MP. If what I am hearing is right then why all these people are not already locked up as these are illegal under current Law. I am not sure of what her views on \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1. Anyone who supports a <b> racist </b>state like Saudi Arabia or Israel and their discriminatory politics must be challenged. And this should not be called Antisemitism as then the whole humanity will all become<b>  racist</b>. We will refuse to accept Israeli oppression until all refugees are retuned back and given one man one vote and until there is no religious prejudices or loyalty benefit for any one group of people in any state regardless of where it is including Saudi Arabia, Israel and anywhere for that matter. It is quite dangerous to mix such sentiment with antisemitism and I am convinced that is going on right now. Therefore we must separat<b> e racis</b>m element (the real antisemitism) from political element (Zionism) and should never mix the two. I dislike ISIS, Far Right, Zionism, Wahhabism a<b> nd raci</b>sm with every bone in my body but I love tolerance and inclusion. I am sure most people in the mainstream centre right or left feels this way.",

I have simply inferred so far that Israel carries out its existence in a manner which has displaced a large percentage of the former population of Palestine and acts in an egregious manner towards them. This is well documented. I only brought it up as you had already started on the subject of Israel.\n\nAs for Berger, no one should be subjected to any sort of abuse based on their religion or <b> race.</b> If I worked with a Jewish colleague in the workplace and they were subjected to personal abuse, obviously I would report it. I also think Holocaust denial should be treated as hate speech. Where I draw the line is when people like yourself cry<b>  racist</b> as soon as they hear or read anyone referring negatively to political Zionism and Israel's policies. \n\nYou are guilty of that.",
