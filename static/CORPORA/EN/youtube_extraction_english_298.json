However, I will say that I do agree with her on one thing: when the conversation is brought up, yes, white people need to really stop chiming in and finding a way to play the victim, or being offended by the generalization , because that in itself is selfish behaviour. When white people want to find reasons to get offended during this topic, you are basically putting the conversation and the real issue on pause, because you are stuck up on the fact that you got offended over words or an over generalization, and simultaneously forgetting that the real struggle and issue are those experienci<b> ng raci</b>sm.

Either that or you're just can't over the fact we pointed out how intellectually deficient you are but afraid to to admit it. So, you decide to strawman what I said. You know what a strawman is, right? You know it's when you argue against an argument that was never made. Thus making look desperately stupid in the process. You know, that strawman aka an easily noticeable logical fallacy. Either way, you got <b> nothing </b>to stand on at this point. In short, you lost this argument so much that you're desperately trying to cling on to something that isn't there. At least show some dignity while you're at it okay?",

Any other talk that white ppl suffer with those others or hat<b> e racis</b>m,or feel what one is going through....well that's ridiculous and an insult. <b> As raci</b>sm was invented by whites in the last century and it gave them advantage,a feeling of beeing something superior,it have them money, richdome,and power.

Now if u wanna believe that whites are<b> n't rac</b>ist from the earliest day of their birth due to their parents,that person is really really really a daydreamer. They don't realize what it means to build a entire civilisation on that so if they're bout to understand what will happen when this situation changes and others are the majority,others who really build the country then they get scarf.

                    "commentText": "@Finn Wraith my friend let me tell u SMT. First of all there are scripts from the Greeks for expl. The Greeks were the first euro civilization. The Greeks came to Africa,Kemet,which is now called egypt. Homer and Herodotus wrote bout the ppl they saw and their knowledge and especially their appearance. None of them mentions Arab like or even white ppl! But how come its drawn and shown everywhere as Caucasian? The next thing is; Slavery and Service! Slavery known as what it is not today comes from the white ppl. It is quite unimaginable what this ppl did to human beeings!!! Africans ,Arabs, Hindus,Chinese, Japanese ppl etc. were used to this service labor. Never u had the right to treat ppl like tht. Even when one was captured as war prey it was never ever ever comparable to that satanic bs the White's committed!!! To point to other parts of the world and trynna make others as guilty as whites are only works on stupid idiots! The level of inhumanity and satanism of those ppl,Ur forefathers is just ways beyond imagination so there are two options; 1. Play Ur  story down if thats not possible coz of too much evidence and proof, then do the second thing; \nLevel up the others crimes,so I don't stand alone!!! U say others hot on Africans before? Who? Who? Tell me,I wanna know. As I know the prophet s.a.s said told the prophecy tht the shepherds,the barefooted,shoeless, none having Arabs,will build higher n higher skyscrapers...... Those,who have <b> nothing!</b>!!! Oil was found in the begging of the last century. Islam started 1400 years ago. Before Islam came ,there was<b>  NOTHING</b>,NOT ONE SINGLE THING FROM THE ARABS!!!!! Swords,body armour,any kind of technologies all came from abroad to them,while in Africa empires like the malinka,Kush, Nubia, punt, Ge'ez,Karthago etc was thriving! And now for all those who think bout Arab like or Berber northafricans......Those ppl aren't the indegenious ppl of northafrica. Those northafricans today came from the Balkan region. Of course there took place mixings so some of them look darker skinned. As we go on. Even the Romans saw,interacted and breed with any type of human beeings!!!! The fact is that modern white ppl started thi<b> s racis</b>m in modern times! Never was there One conquer of for expl. East Africa by Arabs! Also West Africa! The Arab ppl came as refugees to Africa ,to Abessinia! \nWhite man stole , HISTORY, identity, conscious, heritage and life's!!!  Now this is even visible  in his history books,he teaches his children,he made LAWS to discriminate human beeings and called them OFFICIALLY 1/3 OF HUMAN!!! NOW U WANNA REALLY TALK ABOUT OTHERS????He made up fake sciences and is still doing tht collective mindrobbery by Media for expl. Brainwash u white . Hollywood embarrassed themselves <b> as bla</b>ck artist denied the Oscars\ud83d\ude02\nClearly to see the whit agenda thts pierce thru Ur head and u not able to get it\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\nAnd that's the case. Whites Never admitted,never excused,never rehabilitated anything! No no no! Instead they tried to fight those surpressed ones by keeping them silent. Why would I try to keep one silent,why would I come up with fake sciences ? Just to preserve the fake I established and to cover up the truth. What is the truth? Well if all what I say makes sense to u, start tracing from the result. The result of white mens actions is that he wanted to make the world believe ,he is the superior one.....By far evrything we know is almost evrything he told is a lie! America was a lie to be the first ones there! So when the result of his campaign ws supposed to be this,what is the reverse? \nOne fact is that the ancient ppl were<b> n't rac</b>ist,they had no reason for it. The opposite is tru,they were very curious bout each other",

My original post had me specifically commenting on this <b> woman </b>in this video who clearly gave up on life at one point and then realized that she could get her second wind by blaming others for her shortcomings in life. I'm speaking of this one specific<b>  woman</b>. That's clearly what she's doing here and we accept that as truth. Enter you. You came in with your words of wisdom and life knowledge claiming that an entir<b> e rac</b>e <b> is raci</b>st. I, as well as you, know that to be false. So I guess my question to is: Did you have a bad day that day Jonathan? Why do you make a false projection onto an entire class? Because, you know, that sounds ki<b> nda rac</b>ist Jonathan. It's almost as if this exchange is somewhat representative of what's going on in today's politics. A bunch of screaming people with no basis for truth,n o backbone to actually do anything about, and proceed to the next step of crowning yourself victim. Because we all know that's how children react. That's the easiest way to cope with your anger. Blame others. I understand you now Jonathan.",

All the people that are in power are 'white'. Therefore it is easier for white people to reach a certain level compared to those of non whites. Judging from how you speak of this issue I can see that you are white. The thing is white people dont see this Bc they don't have to go through the discrimination. Me as a non white see this Bc I do have to deal with discrimination on a daily basis. White people having it easy doesn't mean they are all <b> racist.</b> It just means the social structure makes things easier for them.",

                    "commentText": "Wow! Where have you been for all this time? By now you should've figured it out. White people often complain about being victim's of <b> racism,</b> complaining that they feel dicriminated and can't prosper because of affirmative action. They say<b>  Black</b> people take away their jobs and education,even though blacks still remain the most unemployed,our schools are underfunded, not enough resources,not enough teachers,the \nLeast qualified teachers,just a crappy education. After all your complaints you still get the best education,the most employed,the best housing, controlling all three branches of government<b> . Blac</b>k people don't control society through laws and resorces,we don't hold positions of power that have been historically destined for white people. Here's a perfect example of white privelidge: A blonde hair blue white man tried to sell me a T.V. He said \"I steal  from stores and sell for a higher price\". I asked him if he was ever caught and he said \"no,the security guards and cops watch your people,they don't expect this from a blonde hair blue eyes white man,I get away everytime\". If this is not good enough for you,I don't know what else to tell you. Who gets the best and fastest service in all aspects of life while everyone else is on back of the line? Who worries less about discrimination in all aspects of life? White people are not being pushed to the back of the bus,denied voting rights,denied human rights. You don't walk while white,shop while white,drive while white,live while white. You cruise through life going untouched by all forms of discrimination. Did you hear about the white guy that was realeased from jail after picking up and throwing a kid on your ground for not removing his hat during the national anthem? That's white privelidge, Anyone else would have been giving a high bail,he could've killed that kid. How about Eric Garner,if he was white he would have been sweet talked into submission. \" How are you today?\" \"Are you hungry?\" \" Want some coffee?\" This is another form of white privelidge.White people call the cops and zoom!!! Withing a heartbeat,the cops are on the scene. Everyone else has to wait 5,10,15,20.......Still waiting.",

You would not believe the hate I hear on ham radio, mainly the frequency 3.840 mHz starting at 8:00 AM until around 10:30 AM.  There is an individual who's call sign is W5YJB who's name is William B. Chapman.  You can look up his call sign on @t.  He represents @t and @t.  Just take a look at this stuff.  In my honest opinion, these individuals who hang out on this frequency are dangerous.  They preach their hatred towards blacks, gays, Muslims and those who are not \"Christian.\"  This morning, Bill Chapman said that the \"<b> black </b>death\" will hit the Los Angeles, California area because of the \"evil\" there.  He said this is going to happen until that \"evil\" answers to the Creator. One of the individuals who is a regular on there is a<b>  woman</b> who is a doctor.  Another one is a man in Bastrop, Texas who's name is Reed Hurley.  His call sign is KA5WZY.  He asked me how I can even be a white person because I take up fo<b> r blac</b>k people.  He is very open about h<b> is raci</b>st views.  He really hates gays and blacks. It is so sad t<b> hat rac</b>ism is still very strong in the South. I still see Confederate flags all over the place down here.",

If it doesn't apply to you, why so bothered? Call out discrimination, <b> racism,</b> and exploitation when you see it, correct/reverse it when you can, and don't perpetuate it. That's how you do your part. None of this, 'Well, I'm white but I'm not racist' BS. It's not about the label, it's your actions and thoughts that's most important.",

You probably go daccore with me when we say there are people who suffer from others ,only because they exist. How can Ur pure existence then be not effective? By  knowing evrything u know bout \"white civilization\" u remained to just leave it as it is....You know very well what is going on and what crimes whites committed against the entire human population on this planet. You know very clear the facts but u prefer living exactly like that.

She has privilage because shes got ridiculous views whilst i have none, and thats discriminati\u014b against me. Just because im white doesnt mean im privilaged. If anyone is being discriminated against harshly atm its muslims, bei\u014b portrayed and misrepresented as terrorists and murderers by extremists such as ISIS which is then pounded into pubilc opinion by right wi\u014b  nationalists on the news and web. This<b>  woman</b> cant claim shes bei\u014b discriminated against because she probably hasnt experienced some of the terrible trash humans are capable of. One of the most recent and horrifi<b> c racis</b>t acts taken against <b> an ethn</b>ic group was \u00fee holocaust, which by \u00fee way mainly targeted European Jews, who were predominantly white. And acts like this still take place today in much smaller proportions all over the world, so claimi\u014b that racial violence is a crime all white people are guilty of in our first world society with our hate crime laws and diversity quotas really makes her look a bit square and uninformed. Sorry, i lost track of time, but it really annoys me when people who claim a great crime has happened against them whilst others are going through far worse in our own country.\n\n\n\nP.S. Idk why i used \u014b and \u00fe, habit?",

Yet we should always be offended bc our ancestors died, got rapped, and still we can't pass down heritage money or even our real names. Dear white people stop being offended and start giving some of that blood money back to our communities that could change our financial DNA, just as our ancestors blood changed your financial DNA and even that small dosage of melanin in your blood that allows you to be a Day walker at least for a few hours. If your offended by my words its because your feeling guilty of a painful Truth. Share the wealth that's how we can start making corrections.

                    "commentText": "As an Asian, it appears to me that blacks harbor the greatest vocal animosity, and without much merit. However, regarding this issue, I believe it originally lies in the deterioration of our education system. For over a millennia, Trivium and Quadrivium had produced a long line of some of the wisest, virtuous, and intellectually competent men in history. From Emerson, Schiller, Goethe, Kant, Descartes, Spinoza, Swedenborg, Carlyle, Nietzche, Addison, and so forth. This tradition, and the intellectual atmosphere it created was what enabled and propelled mankind out of the medieval ages, into an era of enlightenment and innovation. But in the 1800s, the industrial revolution changed the entire dynamic of progress of Europe and the Americans. Education previously was a long and difficult process, requiring many years of strict cultivation. It is no exaggeration to say that the middle school equivalent back then was what post graduate degrees would be today. Despite this, it was greatly beneficial. However with the industrial revolution looming and booming, many families sought the promise of better pay and employment in the city. They moved in droves, crowding the streets and amplifying the financial and political power of big companies. Most families did not see the pertinence of spending money for an education, when they could simply send their young children to factories, often with dangerous machinery. \n\n\n\nThis became the popular trend. As families became somewhat more financially stable, their numbers grew, increasing the world population. Few generations in, quality education was dying, while general ignorance was extremely <b> common.</b> As it happens, ignorance and cultural shifts go hand in hand. We enter the early 1900s and we see the \"party generation\" aka the roaring twenties, and subsequently more and more people, raised in the cities, who support materialism and sensuality more then spiritual and intellectual growth. It wasnt until the 1950s that people started dealing with civil rights, women equality, and other social matters. Along with the rise of \"hippies\". But these people, intellectually speaking, understood little of such affairs, much like today. Ironically, Trivium and Quadrivium was legally pushed out of the curriculum in the 1900s as well. As you may know, education in the modern era is commonly the rote memorization of facts, the crowding of the intellect. An education that does not instill critical thinking, but \"what\" to think, aka indoctrination. Not to mention \"Tests\" were often similar to trivia. How does this all tie in to your original post? Well today, such circumstances have set the foundation where there are increasing controversies and issues that revolve around social causes. From<b>  racism</b>, to politics, t<b> o gende</b>r equality, <b> to <b> g</b</b>>ay rights, etc. But majority of people do not have an education that sufficiently enables them to think logically. They move towards emotions, and habits that result from being emotionally biased. As you k<b> now, ra</b>cism is commonly a heavily misappropriated term thats lost all logical significance. Its become a buzzword/scrapegoat to deflect and blame an<b> other</b> race or party, putting them under social scrutiny and avoid serious and rational discussion, especially given most of them are incapable of doing so. This is but one example. But above all... \"democracy dies in darkness\", in other words, the quality of a democratic society is only as a proficient and just as their education enables them to be. As we have seen, it has become deficient in many regards. This ignorance has let SJWs and other less desirable groups spread their ignorance and hatred into what it has become today. All the while continually benefiting off white innovation and progress, though I hate to phrase it like that. In summary, this ignorance is what is enabling anchor babies, illegal immigration, and racial disparity to run so rampant. The election of incompetent people, and the constant pandering and giving in to left leaning groups is the cause of the fall of western culture. Imo, refugees and southern immig<b> rants, A</b>frican americans, and the Chinese, are currently your worst enemies. China especially has been utilizing every immoral deceit and legal/illegal trickery to suck money off the west. Their whole society was built on theft, copying, and mass underpaid labor. Their society embodies the extreme of everything that is wrong and superficial. The best anyone as an individual can do, is train ones moral and intellectual disposition. Assume the intellectual heritage that forwarded mankind out of darkness. And hopefully, enter a position of power, fighting against the ignorant and unworthy elected.",

Racis</b>m is actually acting on that belief so like i said since blacks can not and have not affected any other races well being, i.e economy, real estate , buisness,  neighborhoods, social economic, justice system, jobs & careers or any other God given liberty they cannot be tru<b> ly raci</b>st. Blacks dont have any social structures to affect i.e. (banks, walk street, real estate, agrictural, or mass production companys) other peoples lives in a mass or large scale. Its also worth mentioning blacks have been enslaved, raped, murdederd, lyched, shot down, unjustly prosecuted, stole from, exploited and alientated from economic inclusion while providing the country with 400 years of free labor to jump start the economy that was critical to make the country what it is. That free labor laid the foundation of the country when the founding fathers were penning out the pillars of this society. It also lead to the industrial revolution wchich led to even more economic growth while the people who did the work were left with no land, severance pay, could not get loans, jobs, proper education, skill sets, all while fighting for civil rights and in wars to be left out in the cold with little to no assistance from society, or the federal gov while at the same time the federal gov was giving out millions of acres to whites and sending agricultural wards to treach them to farm the land. THAT IS THE DEFINITION<b>  OF RAC</b>IST.",

                    "commentText": "\u200b@May Lee Yet people infinitely more learned and intelligent than you did not reach that conclusion? You pride yourself on faithful ignorance. Even the most religious and highest Christians expoused intellectual self autonomy and the active pursuit of knowledge for the ends of understanding God's design, as much as it is possible within the mortal frame, though man can never fully apprehend it. Even the bible has a line that says that even believers are not yet ready to for God without first developing spiritual insight and perception. All of your beliefs are merely predicated on presumptions of absolution, yet lack any logical basis. Hence this is where intellectuals come in from every side. Francis bacon said on behalf of religion that \"It is true, that a little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism; but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion.\" \n\nRegardless, you would not know know this, but there has never been on this earth, a more profound virtue, peace, happiness, than the spiritual nirvana that comes from Philosophy. Assuming God was real, one does not require an active participation or conscious worship of God as a symbol to comprehend his works and elevate the soul. In fact, excessive worship of the \"personage\" of Jesus and God as symbols have become the taint and and decay of Christianity. A culture of tradition, and not one of revelation. It appears you clearly didn't understand what I meant by tradition in my previous post. To be a true Christian, is to allow the holy ghost to come down into you, just as it did for Jesus. The whole purpose of his example was to also become like him. It is not something that depends on the bible to understand or experience, for if it did, it would admit Christianity of its falsehood, as the bible does not determine the laws, but attempt to aim to observe it. And in admitting it observes it, this shows the laws and capacity for understanding has existed since the beginning of his creation, for how then could humans comprehend the bible in the first place then otherwise? We were already endowed with the means of achieving understanding, we simply have to start using our gifts. Again, it is ironic, some of the most adamant atheists, or non Christians, were more Christian than Christians themselves. Swami Vivekananda in particular was a Hindu man who can be considered a modern Jesus. He carried with him the book \" Imitation of Christ\" when he was a wandering monk. You will perhaps find an account of his life interesting.",

                    "commentText": "@Burning Pipe Maybe we both have problems understanding each other. The only way an atheist  can seem to be more Christian than an actual Christian is by works alone, for he does not believe in the one & true living God and therefore has no faith or love for him. Even if the atheist' love for other people is true and sincere,  it is meaningless, because faith for our Father comes first; how can you know what love is if you don't know love - that's why Christ will say \"get away from me I never knew you\". What good is it to be more Christian than an actual Christian if you going to be condemned without the law anyways? You can't earn righteousness or be more righteous, you can't do anything to be saved, you are helpless; all you can do is believe that Christ took away the sins of the world and that He has the power to cleanse you from your sins and have faith that He will keep his promise for He made the promise - \"who ever shall believe in me shall have everlasting life\". This is what pissed the Pharacees off so much, but it was they who broke the covenant, not God.\n\n Phrase 'the law' refers specifically to the compilation of decrees found in the first five books of the Bible, called Torah; it was given by God to his people. We would not even know the difference between good and evil(says Paul), without the law telling us what to do and what not to do. But above all, Paul makes clear that God's love fulfills the law. The law tells us the kind of life that our love for God and our neighbor would require. Obviously all those laws about sacrifices are finished in the one and complete sacrifice of Christ. All the dozens of laws about the land, foods, and rituals of Israel don't pertain to us either. Nor can the keeping of any set of laws give us eternal life.\n\nI wrote about the law, because I'm studying the book of Romans at the moment where Paul teaches that we don't just toss out God's commands and become a lawless gang.\u00a0Every believer is a new person in Christ, therefore he or she loves God and his/her neighbor; the timeless law of God is written in our hearts now and obedience is our joyful adventure. Disobedience to God is our rotten failure. This is why an atheist who acts more Christian than an actual Christian is doomed; it's impossible trying to merit forgiveness, inherit the Kingdom, or evolve spiritually by works. It is only through forgiveness by sheer mercy because of Christ's sacrifice. An actual Christian, can repent for his or hers sins and be filled with the Holy Spirit, because they believe in Christ; which is something an atheist cannot ever do, for an atheist does not know God not believes in His existance. \n\nChrist is the new covenant, the new law. We are to be like Christ, even more, we are told to be perfect. Baptism is actually a funeral where we die with Christ and our <b> old </b>bodies get buried with Him and we become new thanks to His resurrection. As God's new creation we actually want to obey His law, not because it gets us anything, but because of our love for Him. \"I desire to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart.' (Psalm 40:8)",

White people just want history to go away but these types of conversations are important in order to stop the unequal wealth that whites have historically benefitted from. The point being made is white people are the only <b> race </b>truly benefitting from the bloodshed and corruption of their ancestors, they know this but don't care to change it, talk about it or anything and ultimately very dismissive. This is because most white people inherently think they deserve it and honestly believe they work their ass off from their wealth when historically it's incorrect and white people generally keep all their wealth within the white community. Anytime you see big business that have blown up lie Amazons and Facebooks it's not because they were just better than other races its because all that wealth that has historically been in the white community is invested into white businesses. If my family has historically been rich like say the Rothschild I and since the beginning of the Americas I can influence an entire<b>  Nation</b> by who I choose to invest my money into and what companies I decide will get big. It's definitely not the same as the Asian man down the road who just opened his own business. A lot of white people try to discount inherent wealth earned by things life slavery but non-whites kno<b> w racis</b>m and white superiority influence the economy more than people will admit.",

All this drama is quite sad. \n<b> \nRacism</b> in my head is this. \n\nIf I called <b> a blac</b>k person an ugly n##### or directly turned him down for a job at my work because he was a straig<b> ht bla</b>ck man, now that would<b>  be rac</b>ist.\n\n Like the white man who was refused to join the police because he was white and straight the other week. I find it funny most liberals and <b> some b</b>lack people will loo<b> k for r</b>acism under every nuc and cranny until they can muster something tangible up. Relating skin colour with social status. \n\nGrey areas are b.s it is or it isn't. Stop giving these deluded weak people the attention they crave. Look at the state of her ffs who would take this girl seriously in their right mind. \n\nI'm from one of the UK'S most poorest areas, it is to this day a city of mostly whites, maybe the odd Chinese couple. In this town where I came from, people will grow up to be drugs abusers, alcoholics, criminals, on the dole, just existing, like many of the Friends and family we left as a child. High crime rates and lack of government funding. I<b> s that </b>racist towards whites? See why I don't like liberals very much, th<b> ey lack</b> common sense, not many people know that Hitler was a liberal. He holded identical values as the liberals today. Silencing, naming and shaming anyone they deem to disagree with open borders and what not. Liberals are trying to change history as a ploy to make white people more sympathetic with people wanting to come to our land and take over. Have use noticed the increase of white homeless? Meanwhile 272k  immigrants got housed over night. This is a silent takeover and no one is saying anything about it. \n\nThe BBC is on panorama about being a fake news far left, with many other's after being part of the hope not hate, far left terrorists. Not forgetting the bbc  are oppressors with the tv tax. It's no better then the window tax we had here once before. I proudly don't pay my TV licence and I havn't in all of my adult life. \n\nAs you can tell this s### pissed me off. Bbc do me a favour and expose yourselves.

                    "commentText": "KikiNeko XD \n\nToday I'm going to tell you why the argument for that <b> black </b>people cant be<b>  racist</b> is a myth. The mos<b> t commo</b>n argument is privlage plus power. Or the power structures argument. It is the notion that because that white people have not been oppressed back then society that they can <b> be raci</b>st toward them.\n\n1: The SJW definitions which stipulate t<b> hat rac</b>ism<b>  and se</b>xism must be systematic are not found in any dictionary.\n\n2: We are going to break down white privilege. White people do not have any edge in America in today's society and government. The reason that people think otherwise is because people want equality of outcome not equality of opportunity. We have equality of opportunity which means<b>  that </b>black people can do as much as white people with out discrimination. But what people fail to understand is that if we had equality of outcome that would mean that we would have created a society that does not support work because you no matter how good you would do in the job you would not get more money so in turn you would not be incentivised to work harder. This has already been tried and it faild you might know<b>  it as com</b>munist Russia.\n\nNow for<b>  power</b>. Black people can can be elected by the people to the highest office in the land twice in a row. For eight years. Now I dont know what that tells you ot<b> her th</b>an black people can get into any powerful position in the world. But again this comes back to people wanting equality of outcome. The reason that white people hold more powerful positions it because there culture. Now this is vague so I will explain. Asian culture is centered around getting a college degree and getting a high paying job. But on the o<b> ther s</b>ide black people do the opposite they shun people who who want to learn. So before you come and attack white people because they hold posi<b> tions </b>that black people can get why dont you ask why are they not motivated to get to those positions.\n\nSo now that we have broken down the fundamentals of the argument and disproved them I ask you why do you think t<b> hat rev</b>erse racism is real.",

Without white people society would collapse. Lets get rid of that stupid word \"rascism\", it's a made up word for minorities to turn to when things dont go their way. Hatred is a more appropriate word to use because everyone can be hateful. RASCISM was a word designed for minorities to use even though its just HATRED in desguise.",

If an employer uses <b> race </b>quotas to fill positions rather than merit, will that provide a greater benefit than hiring the one who has the best skills and qualifications?\n\nOf course not. The reality is that if minorities want to succeed and get past an ingrained societal disadvantage they have to work for it, and most are not prepared to put in the effort. This societal problem is not something that can be overcome in a decade, a century or even a millennium. Everything we value and benefit from of Western society was assembled over generations by \"White people\". When sub-Saharan Africa puts together a superior culture and civilisation then they can call the shots... But as that's not likely to happen anytime soon all you can do is wait and try to make things better.. or wait until the whole population of the world is a dark skinned hybrid of races. \n\nEither way this discussion is pointless and will never accomplish anything other than deepening the divide and inequality.",

So, your current President doesn't like Muslims, immigrants, foreign travelers, but doesn't do jack shit when blacks get shot, Mexicans get imprisoned, and immigrants get deported back, to the countries Trump likes to call \"Shit hole\" countries. But what was it you were trying to say again, hmm????? You know how many times my own family got discriminated against by far Righters????? I even got sexually assaulted by a Caucasian who was a Christian, while I was abroad, yet I got slut-shamed for that. <b> Nobody </b>had any sympathy or empathy for me, yet that Man was forgiven and he didn't face any jail time.

For example, one American slave reported that 130 other American seamen had been enslaved by the Algerians in the Mediterranean and Atlantic just between 1785 and 1793.\n\nDavis said the vast scope of slavery in North Africa has been ignored and minimized, in large part because it is on no one's agenda to discuss what happened.\n\nThe enslavement of Europeans doesn't fit the general theme of European world conquest and colonialism that is central to scholarship on the early modern era, he said. Many of the countries that were victims of slavery, such as France and Spain, would later conquer and colonize the areas of North Africa where their citizens were once held as slaves. Maybe because of this history, Western scholars have thought of the Europeans primarily as 'evil colonialists' and not as the victims they sometimes were, Davis said.\n\n\nsource: news.osu.edu",

And<b>  black</b> people today still experience side effects from the past. Yeah they aren't in effect anymore, but their effects still show today in the ghettos. That's wh<b> y blac</b>k people still feel oppressed. Not because the government is purposely putting them down like they did in the past, but becau<b> se nothi</b>ng is happening to raise them back up. We have to climb out the ghettos ourselves. And some white people wanna say 'just do it and atop being lazy' when they've never experienced that shit. Their privilege is being a descendant from those slave holders, that's already a big privilege. Due to the shit passed down throughout the family. Same goes for <b> why bl</b>ack peoples feel oppressed. White people aren't being punished for their ancestors, they're being punished for not doing shit to fix it. If I see a man about to get ran over, and I choose not to help, when my life wouldn't be in danger, I'm at fault for his death. Because I had the clear opportunity to help with no harm to myself, and I refused to. Death by negligence.",

            "commentText": "As a white guy who lived in Memphis (I stayed at the jobcorp facility 300 students only five of us white) I faced what they call micro aggression and what I call confusion. As I talked to my fellow students ,who have in some cases never even met a white person before(Memphis is heavily segregated), I heard some of the most ludicrous things. I was told \"I thought all white people came from money\" (my family has been living below the poverty line for generations). When telling some of my friends that I missed my grandmas beans and cornbread or hamhock and collard greens, I was met with looks of shock and the remark that \"you eat that? I thought y'all only eat white people food.\" To which I wondered what the hell white people food was. I took a course at a trade school there and they had a barber class giving free haircuts. Went in to get one and everybody stopped what they were doing and looked at me like I was a leprechaun. The instructor asked me what I wanted which was a simple shortening and she had me sit down. She then pulled out scissors which I said wouldn't Clippers be easier? To which she told me \"you can't cut white folk hair With Clippers\" which made me laugh cause my mah has only ever used Clippers and same with my dad(marine Nam vet). Before she started cutting she called the class over and had them sit in a full circle around me really close because \"they ain't ever cut white folk hair before so you will be an excellent lesson\". I sat there as these <b> black </b>students sat there either feverishly writing notes or staring in wonderment in a thinker like pose. On a rare occasion I was able to sneak off campus and go get a beer or something and I was told many times by my<b>  black</b> friends \"bro you cant go into that hood your a big white guy with glasses and a polo they are gunna think your rich you will be an instant target\" I never cared tho cause I'm from west side san antonio and grew up in the hood so I can take care of myself. I did almost get jumped several times but again i know how to handle myself. The point of this story is I never saw it as some form of subverted aggression or ever thought they wer<b> e racis</b>t, I knew that it was simply confusion towards<b>  a ra</b>ce they never had the opportunity to socialize with, Thats all it is. Anybody who preaches this microagression garbage is do<b> ing noth</b>ing more then promo<b> ting ra</b>cism and ignorance and it's going to cause damaging affects. America has came a long way sinc<b> e him</b> crow but with more people acting like this it's running the risk of bringing us all back to the day<b> s when </b>racism actually was rampant.",

Its simular to being the kid of a killer in the sense you become associated with something you wish not to be, I think this is the sort of consequence that comes with immoral acts, no one wants to be told that they are related to a guy that seperated families and maybe tortured and condemned a peoples, generally people want to be seen as good and they believe if they somehow came from gruesome roots that could influence or changed that, you need to get past peoples defensiveness and definitive judgement if you want to construct and change society otherwise you may risk being bashed and misunderstood for a poor choice of words and give people more reason to be victims of <b> nothing </b>and be unanimously hated",

This country might not be perfect, but the majority of the people around the world would kill to be here. People keep bringing up slavery, but guess what. Slavery is not just part of US history, is part of the world history. As long as human civilizations existed there were always slavery, practiced by people on all continents.",

No one is perfect, they made mistakes in the past but those who made the mistakes are dead now. White kids and white people nowadays in america dont entertain slavery, they had absolutely no part it in  and we should treat them as so.<b>  Racism</b> is kept going by a lot o<b> f blac</b>k people, not all, but a lot from experience and from what i see. They blame whites for their hardships yet in all honesty? They arent trying to help themselves. Hoods would be safer if the people who lived in them didn't involve themselves with gangs and shit like tha<b> t. Bla</b>ck kids dont have dads a lot of the times, thats another big problem that's v<b> ery com</b>mon in<b>  the b</b>lack community. And it sucks, i know it sucks. But with all things considered.. we have to stop with this mindset of white privilege and shit like that. Not every white pers<b> on it r</b>acist, not<b>  every</b> black pe<b> rson is</b> racist. WE as a people need to come together and talk about our problems and peacefully discuss what's wrong instead of getting offended or being so overly sensitive.

We didn't think that there was anything wrong with<b>  race</b> mixing either, that is until we found out that we were wrong. \n\nWe are now divorced and temporarily living as roommates until he is able to get a job with full-time hours (his current job isn't cutting it) so that he can support himself. We've all been programmed by the Jewish media to mix. My husband is 54 and I'm 45. He has mixed children from a previous marriage and my children are white.\n\nIf you don't believe that there is truth in the Bible, I can relate. I was an outspoken atheist for the vast majority of my life. Most Christians will be murdered before all of this is over regardless of skin color. This is a war and many of us will see many terrible things unfold.\n\nThe Jews created Islam and have overtaken the Catholic Church (which was never true Christianity to begin with, but rather, it is an amalgamation of Christianity and it's original pagan roots, which was originally established by Constantine). The only world leader who does not kiss the hand of the Pope is Netanyahu.  \n\nIf it doesn't click for you, maybe it was never meant to. It is nonetheless the truth and \"it really is all real.\" In quotes because that is what many of us say when we realize it. We cannot believe that we've been so deceived but the Bible told us all along. Likely parts of the Bible have been corrupted over time but there is still much truth inside.",

I know that the things I've shared that you were not yet aware of are difficult to hear. Much of it was for me too. I've had some \"supernatural\" experiences that drove me to the decision to replace my atheism with Christianity in 2016. Obviously, what is called  \"Christianity\" today has been infiltrated, hijacked, watered down and largely pagan.\n\nI read the Bible for the first time in 2016. When I read it, I read it as having been written to the Jews. I am preparing to read it again from this different perspective myself. It definitely appears that there have been changes made to the Bible; though the Jews still aren't mentioned until the 11th book. The true Christian assembly has only one leader which is Jesus the Christ who literally was, and is still, our Father in the flesh.\n\nYou and your wife are definitely well ahead of the curve being that you are able to recognize much of the role of the Jews in today's world. Most people refuse to look into anything that has been portrayed as a conspiracy theory by their media propaganda. Many so-called \"conspiracy theories\" are already proven conspiratorial truths, while many more are still denied even with plenty of evidence to back them up.\n\nIf you would like me to share some links with you, I'm happy to. Feel free to contact me through my channel anytime.  I offer because truth,\u00a0in case you haven't noticed already, is heavily censored on the www (666). The Father is in complete control but this is Satan's world for now. We all have a choice who we will follow, whether we are aware of it or not.\n\nFor the record, I've only been made aware of \"white\" people being the true descendants of Abraham, Issac, and Jacob for less than two weeks now.",

This is why the US for a very long time especially around the beginning of the US only traded exclusively with Europe and stole resources from places like Africa. Why do you think when the brit needed help from Hitler the US stepped in and helped the with building weapons to defend themselves. While they left Africa high and dry from trade so that Africa could sty poor. To this day the US and Europe has paid Africa crumbs even though they deserved a lot more drom what Africa was giving to the US and Europe. Now that China has become a  Major partner in trade with Africa suddenly Europe and the US and pouring lots more money into Africa. If Europe and the US wasn't a <b> racism </b>system they would have had equal trade inclusion amongst all great nations. From the beginning Europe and the US which is most white Europeans have discriminated against non white countries and those countries ended up being the poorest because instead of Europe taking all that wealth to improve economy all over the world which would have boosted Europe's economy they keep most of their wealth within Europe while other countries are dirt poor. However, China has been doing what the US and Europe refused for so long by building up poor nations economy.",

Had police break my jaw for asking a question. Ribs broken for getting away making them look stupid. Finally 1 day I gave up let them catch me n I was seriously beaten. Incarcerated for years. Finally got my shit together work my ass off 2 job's still barely getting from paycheck to paycheck. I just don't understand where I have benefited?. 1 job I worked for 4 years was a factory job. In my predominantly white town. However I was 1 of only 3 white ppl. At the factory  the rest Hispanic. I was discriminated against the entire time. I'd go on break to find that my bag had a soda poured into it. Some girl accidentally touched me had a disgusted look n started wiping her hand off like I was gross or diseased. I don't take disrespect from no 1 on earth. But I did for 4 years I had a new baby n 3 other kids a home n I dealt with it. It was worse than the couple things. But so many other white ppl.

For example, a<b>  black</b> family could make $100,000 and be allowed to get the same house and live in the same community as a white family the makes $30,000. Another example, we are being kicked suspended from school for wearing our natural hair. Example 3, jails are a big business and if the state or jail doesn't have a select number of people in jail than they are taxed a huge sum of money. The jail business is huge and take a guess on who the choose to lock up<b> ? Blac</b>k people are incarcerated 5 more times than white. Not to mention how wh<b> en bla</b>ck peoples get out of jail they are less likely to get a job than a white person who committed the same crime. We are losing our lives because we are seen as scary beings, and a person with a gun is so threatened to point were we lose out life. 8/10 times the cop just goes on 2 weeks leave with pay so killin<b> g a bl</b>ack person is equivalent to a vacation. Meanwhile you harm a dog you get 5-20 years; it feels great to have less rights than a dog. Discrimination happens today. We can vote yes, but that's a basic human right. We had a president yes, but he barely did anything<b>  for b</b>lack people besides Obama care. Treating us like actual humans isn't really something to boost about it should just be guaranteed.",

You simply thing we are saying 'WHITE ARE THE PROBLEM' when we aren't. The problem is you don't listen long enough to even hear about the problem we face everyday just doing simple things. For example, buying a house when <b> black </b>with $100,000 will get you the same opportunities as a white person buying a house with $30,000. That is a problem. If it is just simply money then $100,000 doesn't equal $30,000 in any way shape or form. The only difference is you guessed it the color of ones skin. The fact that you can't even address it and simply say that is wrong. Is a BIG PROBLEM. You are trying to justify something in the wrong situation.",

You want to argue abt white privilege, when infact, like u had said, <b> black </b>people don't need to score nearly as high on exams/overall grades, in order to get a higher education. Even in the police academy, 70 or higher and you're in. If you're white, 80-85 or higher,& you're in. They also need to fulfill the quota for having a diverse workplace in all areas of careers/jobs that DON'T EVEN REQUIRE A DEGREE , and<b>  black</b> people, again, don't have to score nearly as high as whites who DO have to work harder. Where's the privilege? Also, 'there's more rich white people than ric<b> h blac</b>k people'. Minority means there's a specific group of people that are smaller in population (in america, speaking), so, basic math..more white people means more people that are..'white'. Say you have 100 people living in america,& 19 of thrm a<b> re bla</b>ck, and we'll say (for argument's sake) there's another 18 that are minorities of <b> non-afri</b>can decent, that leaves 63/100 people are 'white'. Even if 40%of minorites of<b>  non-afr</b>ican american decent are considered upper class /rich, & 40% o<b> f all af</b>rican am<b> erican</b>/black are upper class/rich, that would mean 8.5 <b> ppl/ 1</b>9 black ppl are well-to-do, leaving 'about' 12 people \"poor\", and 7.8 ppl or rounding off..8 out of 18 minorite<b> s of n</b>on-black decent, are well-to do, leaving 'abt' 10, \"poor\", meaning about 22/37 minori<b> tes, b</b>oth bl<b> ack or</b<b> > non-bl</b>ack/african american decent, were considered \"poor\" (or even middle class..just NOT RICH). AND BC THERE'S 63 WHITE PEOPLE OUT OF 100 PEOPLE, U CAN SIMPLY SAY, \"WELL, ONLY 22 MINORITIES OUT OF 100 PEOPLE ARE UPPER-CLASS/RICH\" OUT OF 100 PEOPLE...WELL WHY ARE THERE 'NOT ENOUGH' MINORITIES THAT ARE RICH LIKE U 'WHITE FOLKS Look at the numbers. This is an example (if i used a larger-scale sample out of the over 320million ppl living in america, the % o<b> f them</b> being black, the % of the other minorites, then the white %, of the population, it's always going to seem that 'more WHITE PPL are upper class/rich, simply bc of thr amount of \"white people\", (which btw, white ppl *do not come from the island/land of 'Caucasia', we have tons of diff origins whether russian, Polish, Ukraine, Australian, Iriah, German, french, austrian, Italy, etc) i can go on&on. So THAT WIT<b> HIN ITS</b>ELF IS RACIST.. \"White Person\". Just use numbers and also look at allll the numerous f<b> oundatio</b>ns for African Americans, not just for furthering education,<b>  but t</b>he NAACP, black networks (Bounce, BET, etc)..there is SO MA<b> NY RES</b>OURCES for black people. You even g<b> et a w</b>hole month 'black history month'. Please understand this side of things. I mean this gracefully, in all due respect. I am not taking away from thr struggles& its absolutel<b> y unfor</b>tunate that racism exists, but it exists ALL AROUND THE WORLD.",

            "commentText": "It is high time we stopped being so polite, and set the record straight. Munroe Bergdorf is utterly ignorant of 1400 years of human history. Islamic imperialism inflicted centuries of genocide, tyranny, plunder, cruelty and slavery across the globe. After Eastern and Southern Europe had suffered centuries of being raided by brutal Islamic slave traders, so much so that the word slave [Slav] derives from this history, Poland led a coalition that successfully defended Europe against the Muslim invasion at the Gates of Vienna on 9/11 in 1683. The Ottoman slave trading Islamic empire committed some of the worst genocides in history [against whites] and was finally defeated at the turn of the 20th century. For over a millennium Arabs and Turks enslaved white Europeans. Indeed you could make a strongly evidence based case that the Dark Ages in Europe were a result of incessant slave raids, plundering and attacks that disrupted Europe's access to world trade routes. Saudi Arabia finally banned slavery under UK pressure in 1962, though it is still practiced across North Africa.\n\nMunroe should acknowledge that the Crusades were pushing back against war/ Jihad and slave raids that were occurring on an intense and continuing basis from the seventh century until the invaders were finally defeated in the war against the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the 20th century. We were lead to believe that the Crusades were just some kind of religious  zealotry, a kind of armed Evangelism on horseback. Whereas in actuality the Crusades defended Europe against constant slave raids, plunder and invasion.\n\nShe should also realise that underdevelopment in India and Africa was probably caused by centuries of Islamic imperialism that left mountains of skulls, plundered the wealth of nations, destroyed peaceful cultures, dismantled civilisations and enslaved generations. It was so brutal that 90% of <b> Black </b>slaves bled to death from castration. This commenced long before white folks set forth on these continents. \n\nStill want to say we are the evil ones? No, we are too diplomatic to defend ourselves, but this has to stop. We have to start telling the truth, no matter what bullies try to impose silence upon us.\n\nThe fact is everyone has suffered more from Islam than from any other invader on this earth. White Europeans have suffered far more from Islamic imperialism, than anyone has suffered from white Europeans.",

Even when we look at the history before the Brits came to America they thought their <b> race </b>was superior to all others, colonized, stole resources from places like Africa, enslaved Africans and only seriously traded and shared knowledge with only European nations which has trickled down to them still owning the most wealth in the world. They constantly portray other races that are not white negatively in all of their media from Blacks to Chinese, Mexicans and Middle Eastern and this is because of the inherent<b>  racism</b> a lot of white have still believing th<b> e rac</b>e is the best. Even no as the US continues to demonize China for it's solidifying relations with Africa it's well known that the US and Europe never included Africa into the original trade equally as Europe and America was being built up so they portray Africa as savages leaving out this historical fact and kept Africa poor barely investing money to cause real economic change in Africa but now that China has seriously invested in Africa and Africa is relying less and less in the US the US is actually starting to trade more farely with Africa because the US and Europe aren't the only major players anymore. When you correlate why whites in America kept slaves from trying to read and write to why Europe and the US kept Africa poor you will realize their is a lot <b> of Raci</b>sm from whites still to this day that do not value non-whites and still want to benefit from their countries on top. Never forget that Europeans track record has always had the attitude of conquering and a <b> \"my r</b>ace\" is superior attitude, that still happens today whether many white people want to admit it or not.",

I  know you know this, but you probably find it to astonishing and horrifying to admit to yourself, maybe! but many westerners relish in those ideologies and wish they would be restored. Cynical?! Could be! Out of years of meticulous observations, so yeah! Consciously cynical, but the abuse has gone too far to non-return, far too much to lose on the West's side for them to truly acknowledge all the implications of  addressing the issue let alone do it. What a bizarre thought! One might say. So, you are right ,they have been benefiting from it for eons. If you want to be happy not right (Morality in this context is out of question, we are talking \"Blood\" hereI am sure it's one reason you yourself still hold some hope), Disconnect, educate and reinvent! We never belonged in the West's matrix as equals, don't, will never. The tragedy after all these centuries, we never needed to, We have been narcissitically abused !",

Slavery, tragically, has existed throughout recorded history in almost all civilisations world-wide. <b> Black </b>people have been enslaved during the atlantic slave trade by Europeans yes. But they, along with white people were enslaved during the Islamic slave trade. Slavery still legally exists in many countries, none of these are western countries who were the first to abolish slavery. The European enlightenment called into questioned all of and dismantled most of the hereditary hierarchies in society. This in turn inspired people like William Wilberforce in the UK who pushed for the Slavery Abolition Act passed in 1833. The United States had a war which white people died in to abolish slavery. It also happened to be Western countries which were the first to fight for and win women's suffrage,<b>  ga<b> y</b</b>> rights and civil rights. I find it so aggravating that she decides to collectively blame white people for atrocities committed before any of us were born, and she turns<b>  a bli</b>nd eye to <b> the rac</b>ism which is far more widespread and glaringly obvious in non-Western countries such as countries in North Africa where blacks experience horrific discrimination. Her intentions in writing these tweets were clear: To trigg<b> er a ra</b>cist reaction from the political fringes of society and state that this has proven her point. This is a pathetic tactic, and frankly one which I believe <b> to be r</b>acist. If this happened the other way around, there would be no question that it would be <b> called </b>racist!",

Of course L'Oreal let you go - anyone in the right mind would have done the same.  I don't know what you thought you would gain by your insincere comments.  I'm an individual who is not any of what you claim and yet you are so stubborn and close minded and calling others exactly \"what YOU ARE\" -- Look in the mirror #yougetwhatyougive.  You need to take that huge chip off your shoulder and stop blaming the world and telling us we need to take action.  I think that your words and actions are the real problem here.  You've sent out a message that was beyond offensive to every human being on the planet.",

He said there was a difference between ascribed and achieved status.  Achieved status is based on personal merit and is earned.

You and your white family, even if urban, more than likely live in a neighborhood full of other white people.  Because of this, schools are even more segregated then they were before Brown vs Board of Education!  Your families were allowed to amass wealth that was built on the backs of slave labo<b> r whil</b>e black people were legally denied franchise, voting rights, the right to own property, and to marry a white person well into the 1960s.  \n\nSo yes, our poverty now is directly tied to 300 years of forced labor, <b> and THE<b> N </b</b>>Jim Crow segregation, separate but equal schools, gerrymandering, redlining, blockbusting, mass incarceration, and a whole host of things whiteness has allowed you to only hear about on the news.",

How about the preceding invasions that actually lead to the country itself being formed?\n\nIt might be a nice concept to imagine that ALL forms of in/out grouping would simply vanish, but in reality those traits have been with our species for hundreds of thousands of years, and like it or not, for reasons with utmost utility in terms of evolutionary psychology. \n\nWe don't like to admit it, but imbedded deep into our cognition is a judgement program running on auto-pilot and our senses serve this evolutionary purpose. And yes, those senses include visual. So within seconds of meeting someone every single one of us is making judgements: <b> sex,</b> height, weight, facial expression, posture, clothes, social hierarchy AND skin color.\n\nAny/all forms of systematic oppression should be avoided and combated, but we won't further the conversation by entering an oppression competition. We are all born with, and into, different privileges and misfortunes and must strive, on an individual basis, to leverage our strengths and mitigate our weaknesses, however we deem necessary, again on an individual basis.",

In Ireland during the time of British occupation, Irish charged with minor crimes, were usually signed into indentured servitude as punishment, this was not slavery as we know it today but their servitude was sold to pay the cost of their crimes. Usually the main buyers of Irish indentured servants were large land owners in British colonies mainly in North America, the Caribbean Islands and Australia. The main buyers were almost always of British protestants origin who for many years were propagated into believing the Irish were of an inferior <b> race </b>not only because they were Catholic but because the believed the Irish to be unnatural, inbread, corrupt and uncivilised and treated them as they would any<b>  black</b> or indigenus slaves. The only reason the Irish could not be legal slaves is because they were Catholic and therefore Christian and by Christian law put in place around the 11th or 12th century Christians could not own fellow Christians as slaves or else they would face excommunication from the church.\n An extra fact is that a lot of the minor crimes committed by the Irish were simple crimes such as stealing their own crops to feed their families as in those days the majority of Ireland was owned by the British crown and the Irish were only allowed tenancy and anything grown or produced on these lands belonged to the crown not the people who cultivated them.",

She is not a mouth piece for <b> black </b>people and neither can she speak for white people. She is offensive and will never convince me she has faced any racial abuse  or been held back by white people. She should never been invited onto TV shows as a repayment for what she has said. No doubt she will end up with a TV jobs or some other lucrative deal off the back of this. Jada Pinkett Smith complains of Lilly white Oscars and gets starring role in film, Lenny Henry complains gets a TV part and chancellorship of Birmingham University, Diane Abbott says<b>  racist</b> things is incompetent at her job and uses mean texts to get sympathy and reinstated in cabinet job and so it goes on, but all the time they are benefiting the anger they cause grows.",

                    "commentText": "@Random Guy ok. I was waiting for this.\n\n<b> African'</b>s actively fought against the slave trade.\nWhat you are speaking on is chattel slavery.<b> \nAfrican</b> Slavery by Europeans was it's very own evil. That benefitted the entire world, despite active resistance b<b> y Africa</b>n nation's and their Kings and Queens(1470 - 1800). This fight was foughy in their homeland, on the seas, and in America. There was continuous resistance against Europeans during every phase of the slave trade. Because the rebellions of t<b> he Afric</b>an slaves increased, the slave traders created laws designed to red<b> uce Afri</b>can resistance.\u00a0\n\nThe information we have on on the resistance to slavery came from written documents kept by the European sailors. There is enough information, including historical facts, examples of resistance, and dislike of the European slave trade, to establish that the enslavement of Africans was not accepte<b> d by Afr</b>ican peop<b> le.\u00a0\n\nAf</b>rican leaders and those opposing the European slave trade, organized and assigned large groups to keep watch for slave ships traveling to the East and whose crews were well-known for kidnapping Africans on the coast. For example, King Ansah of Ghana (1470-1486) had the Fante people watch for European ships, and prevented them from coming ashore. Many<b>  other A</b>frican leaders did not permit Europeans in their kingdoms. In Benin, the people had heard of the intentions of the Europeans, so they killed them as soon as they came ashore. There were some kings who agreed to trade with the Europeans, but attempted to stop it once they saw the problems that were created in their lands. Through the tactics of <b> several </b>African leaders and kings, they were able to minimize the European slave trade but they could not stop it completely. The treachery and greed of the Europeans, <b> hurt the</b> African economy and, therefore, damaged trade r<b> elations</b>. African King Nzenga Maremba tried to stop the slave trade in the Congo only after he originally participated in the trade in exchange for military items and support from Portugal. King Maremba agreed to r<b> elease h</b>is African prisoners of war to the Portuguese who wanted the best (1470 - <b> 1800) yo</b>ung African men as a bargaining chip to be sure the King kept his word. The Portuguese promised to train and educate the young men to become priests and later to return them to the Congo. King Meremba let the Portuguese convince him to take the Christian name, Alfonso, as a show of support. When Alfonso asked for the return of a few of his former prisoners, who had been trained to serve as physicians, surgeons, pharmacists, assistants for shipbuilders and carpenters, his requests were denied. After having his requests denied several times, King Alfonso learned that his prisoners of war had been sold as slaves in Portugal. In 1526, King Alfonso wrote to King John III, the former King of Portugal, and asked for his help in ending the slave trade in the Congo. He explained the freedoms that were given to the Portuguese, who had set up shops, become merchants in the Congo and had amassed fortunes. The people in the Congo could not do the same because they had complied with the agreement and now did not have the same abundance of wealth as the invaders. King Alfonso related that the damage was so great that his people and land were being seized daily. King Alfonso ended his letter to King John III with another request for his help because it was the will of the people in the Congo and other kingdoms that there should not be any trading of slaves nor markets for slaves.\u00a0\n\nOther countries that were resisting the slave trade throughout the continent of Africa were Senegal, Ghana, Benin, Ni geria, and Angola. In 1777, King Agadja, a Dahomean monarch, captured an Englishman and his slave raiding party who had entered his kingdom looking for more Africans. The Englishman and his crew were released after they promised to return all the Africans they had captured. King Agadja gave the Englishmen a warning to take to the rulers of England, that if any other slave traders were sent to his Kingdom, or other kingdoms, they would be killed. In 1787, the Senegal King of Almammy, passed a law that made it illegal to take enslaved Africans through his kingdom. To let (1470 \u2013 1800) Europeans know how serious the law was, the king returned the presents French slave traders sent as bribes. Queen Nzingha of Angola fought a successful 30-year war against the slave traders of Portugal until the Portuguese negotiated a treaty with her in 1656. Their treaty remained in effect until she died in 1663.\n\nP.S.\nBut your history books don't have that\ud83d\ude0f. \nWhy? They are anglicized versions of revisioned history.",

So many whites listen to what she says and immediately feel offended because they've just been called <b> racist,</b> and they don't think they're<b>  racist</b>. But that's not the point. The point is, even though as whites we may not feel we have ever been explicitl<b> y racis</b>t or thi<b> nk raci</b>st thoughts, our experience of life is ultimately different from people of colour, who f<b> ace rac</b>ism everyday, and until we acknowledge that and make some kind of effort to change this ourselves, we're essentially being complicit with the system and ignoring the problem. I understand how bizarre it can seem and it does sound far fetched, I must admit I didn't really understand it until I studied this in depth for my degree, but its true whether white people accept or reject what she says. What IS worrying is how many people in the comments are den<b> ying ra</b>cism, or trying to argue that white people exper<b> ience r</b>acism as well. This simply exemplifies her point.",

In fact during the 1930s  blacks were migrating to Russia  to escape American persecution controlled mostly by  Irish Protestants.  The enemy to <b> black </b>Americans has always been the Irish extremist*  The Irish extremists accepted anyone light-skinned to reap the benefits of White status.  That included*  the Italians, Polish, Germans. Look up Senaca village later turned into Central Park. <b>  Black</b> people allowed Irish catholic  immigrants to seek refuge on their land and then the Irish tore it down by laws that benefitted them.  Look at gangs of New York.  I find it hypocritical that irish and Sicilian immigrants tell blacks to get off the Democratic plantation when they used the same  democratic plantation ticket to gain power and acceptance in the United States through Tammany Hall.  \n\nIt was the Irish extremist  that started the white  status in America due to poverty and genocide that they experienced in Ireland.  The other European immigrants such as German and Sicilians just followed them.  Germany hates the United States. Russia, and most Eastern Europeans countries do not like the United States.  That has to do with the inflated sense of superiority that white Americans have over other countries.  This is taught in American schools.  It's called American exceptionalism.  The Irish extremist * are barbarian just as the Great Britain predicted. The Irish came to the United States to exercise white supremacy over blacks.",

Every time blacks got involved in the political struggles of white people, we were burned down, persecuted, and stabbed in the back.  Unfortunately,<b>  black</b> Americans are too politically weak to fight this battle.  You white folks who choose either political sides are on your own with this.  W<b> e blac</b>k people will be happy to provide the medical assistance that is needed for you to stay alive b<b> ut bla</b>ck people should not involve themselves in the struggles of politics.  \n\nMy main suggestion I can make is not to choose any political sides.  Politicians and corporations have a history of using dialectal idealogy to inc<b> ite rac</b>ism to  exploit poor people.  Other suggestions: Do not surround yourself with people who choose political sides..even if it's friends or family.  Stay away from corporations. Support small business.  Be your own boss.  Eat healthy, exercise, read books from the past, stay away from television. Meditate at least 1 hour per day.  \n\nThese are suggestions that can be used to miti<b> gate ra</b>cism because in this country, whites and blacks purposely segregated by the elites for different reasons.  Whites are used for war, blacks are used for cheap labour.  My grandmother told me that a successful person is someone who became opposite of what society wanted them to become.  Because it means that you don't let society define you.  It means you define yourself.  Good luck",

Content really isn't a bad thing it just means your willing to except the way things are and it doesnt really bother you if things change, while most white people think all <b> black </b>people do is complain all day long but the difference is because we actually want change. The ones who stay \"silent\" about it are slightly contributing. Lol it's like nowadays the \"innocent bystander\" means standing by watching and laughing but not being directly involved. It truly is a sad time, however I do see your point about poor white kids in the system. The thing I hate about that point though is that its counterproductive. Like with<b>  black</b> lives matters, I'm not an advocate but people dont realize that by creating an \"All Lives Matter\" it distracts from the real issue! Yes some white families have it hard, BUT no matter how hard you have it the reality is if you have a poo<b> r blac</b>k family in london or anywhere  vs a poor white family, the way the SYSTEM is set up, it would be easier for the white kid to be more successful. And again this isn't generalization I know that every human makes their own choices and some people work harder than others but there are just a lot more roadblocks for people of color especially if they're of low income",

We all learn from each other and we grow and as she said \"so it's uncomfortable get over that uncomfortableness\" well then get over the fact some people were slaves.

They were mad because he is in her video! \nThey call him Uncle Tom and said no white person can really care about <b> a blac</b>k person! \nHow wrong that is!!

Some places, maybe but most will not tolerate her. She was given the chance to show her success off to people who can look up to her but nah, she had to play the sam<b> e ol</b>d tired victim crap. \n\nEven if all this was true... What good does it do going on about it? Is it helping people in their lives or is it an unnecessary hindrance to it? I keep thinking about Morgan Freeman when these matters come up, who said the only way to st<b> op raci</b>sm is to stop going on about it. He is right. I don't refer to you as a white man and you don't refer to me a<b> s a bl</b>ack man and see how it goes. It was working quite well, until teachers began filling students heads with nonsense about white privilege and system<b> atic ra</b>cism. Now, ALL white peopl<b> e are r</b>acist? GTFOH with that shit.\n\nYou can't just cherry pick shite examples from history and use that as a basis of today. If you don't feel safe living among white people or if you are unhappy with how things are being done, then leave. Go elsewhere or help shape the society you want to see and I'm sorry but calling white <b> people </b>racist b<b> ased on </b>nothing but the fact that they are white is backward, ignorant and helps neither blacks or whites and it is not the way forward. We all understood this 20 years ago, so now we are obses<b> sed w</b>ith race again and oh dear, look, it is causing more division. Who would've guessed it?\n\nIt is ridiculous to keep going<b>  on a</b>bout race. It makes you wonder why even bother, in being a good, morally well adj<b> usted, </b>non-racist human being, if you are going to walk down the street to be told that no matter how good you are, you <b> are sti</b>ll a racist because some stupid moron 200 years ago did so<b> methin</b>g to a black man that was cruel and unjust. Never mind the white people who have been slaves or the Asians o<b> r EVE</b>RY other race on th<b> e plan</b>et. Only black people suffered in history, no<b>  one </b>else. It's dumb.\n\nThe PAST... We do not live there, we have no right to jud<b> ge pe</b>ople of ANY race based on that, only the here and now, yet it continues and continues and people defend it like it is going to do something other than degrade relations further. \n\nIt is quite simply moronic.",

So, on an individual level, many individual people of colour are far better off than many individual white people and many individual <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>people are better off than many individual straight people etc.  Yes all these group dynamics are very important to be aware of and to fight against, but we cannot lose the narrower lenses of social understanding and compassion either, in favour of always looking at the biggest ones.

I grew up in a real melting pot of a city, and skin colour was never really a thing at all, and as more and more mixing of cultures happens across the world i can only hope that the rest of the world becomes more like where i grew up.",

If you live in Europe or the US, it is not possible for you as a white person to be the victim of systemi<b> c racis</b>m. However, if you lived in Chad or Saudi Arabia, you definitely could. Many on here want to straw man her argument by leaving out the 'systemic' part of the comment.\n\nSystem<b> ic raci</b>sm is comparable to the difficulties that left handed people face in a world designed for people who are right handed. Most right handed people have not consciously set out to create a world that favours righties, however, this does not change the fact that right handed people have an advantage in the environment they live in (a small percentage of left handed people die because of accidents related to their handedness). It's not a completely flawless analogy, but I find it is a useful way to take the emotion out of the argument to understand the nature of the problem. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the impact of syste<b> mic rac</b>ism also has a direct affect on the self-image of minorities of certain communities (i.e.<b>  how b</b>lack people see themselves).

LOL please tell me because all I know of is places like America, Australia and South Africa who have dealt with oppression and false ownership of a land that is not theirs by white people. Don't try and flip it. \n\nIf you actually speak to these people like I have it's not only a beauty standard, they truly believe that if their skin is whiter they have more opportunities which they do! You haven't traveled like I have and there is so much oppression due to White governments stealing or bombing places. Take Africa for example. Africa is one of the riches contents in the world yet known as a 3rd world country. Why is that? Because for years white men constantly abuse their white privilege to steal their oils, diamonds, organs ect and you will sit there and tell me what I'm saying is bullshit? LOL \n\nThe rest of your comments are ignorant and not worth discussing. If white privilege didn't exist you would have white people also doing the hard jobs and getting their hands dirty. I don't see one white man in Dubai in the heat working. You know why? White privilege!!!! You're the moron",

Not just sitting behind a screen \"hoping\" for a potential revolution that will take our <b> race </b>to the next level. We have become as a population more and more ignorant based of social media. We can sit behind a blank screen for hours and be fed mindless bullshit like Kyile Jenner being pregnant and NOT North Korea dropping weapons potentially in America because Donald Trump is an idiot. \n\nIt's amazing that the Internet however does allow the taboo of<b>  racism</b> be more openly discussed good or bad. It evokes change and for people to think. Reaches a large scale of people but there is still a lot of issues relating around it and the issue o<b> f racis</b>m. I am not saying arguing will change or to physically fight but to seriously sit back and take a look at the issues. I believe the twin towers were a set up to yet divide us as<b>  a nati</b>on and create further segregation. America obviously was not the only one effected by such a tragedy. Many beautiful countries collapsed just like those buildings and still are. None of which are ruled or shared with \"white\" people. I'm not attacking white people at all but someone like Russle Brand opened my eyes a lot more to see the propaganda that the news shares with us. How is it in 2017 in Australia it is ok for white people to still run a country? Because off the books white peoples do not feel the native people are capable to do so? Even though it's their land?!? Tha<b> t's cr</b>azy! \n\nI think your ideology of a fair system in the world that works for everyone is great but ignoring the root of that issue is what's blocking you to understand this whole problem in the first place.",

There was slavery in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Mongolia, China and the Arab empire. The Arab empire also had white european slaves that come from Southern Europe and some Eastern European countries. Even slavery exists during the Golden Horde. Russians and other Eastern Europeans were slaves to the Mongols. Even<b>  racism</b> i<b> s nothin</b>g new or discriminating other<b> s. Raci</b>sm or the concept<b>  of rac</b>ism  has pretty much existed way before the Europeans. There<b>  was ra</b>cism in Egypt on how the Egyptians viewed the Jews. The Egyptians viewed the Jews as subhuman and they thought of themselves as superior to the Jews.There was<b>  also r</b>acism on how the Arabs viewed other non Arabs like the Europeans and North Africans. The<b> re was </b>racism or discrimination in ancient India between the Aryans(northern Indians)  and the Dravidians (southern Indians).

For instance, one of my friends, his dad lost his job a few years ago as an indirect result of the recession. He found another job a few months later (he was an IT technician, so there wasn't as much competition as there would've been for less skilled jobs) and my friend kept telling me that, while he was happy for his dad, he couldn't forget the feeling he'd felt every time his dad had been denied a job, and how, somewhere, there were several families who had someone go in for that job, and were feeling the same, perhaps even worse. For every success story, there are multiple heartbreaks just around the corner. Quite frankly, the way our government treats the poor is appalling, the DWP are truly shocking, my friend's parents found that out the hard way when his dad had to sign on for benefits. No one knows how it's meant to be run, even the people working there haven't had things laid out properly and so are clueless, but it's not their fault, my friend's mum was called away from HER job for a day to go and have an interview to make certain that she actually existed. Honestly, if my friend's parents hadn't been as determined and literate as they are, they wouldn't have been able to keep up. The system is designed to force people to stop claiming by just leading them round in circles. People commit suicide, or are forced onto the street, because of this system and, to be honest, I don't think that's too far off what the government want, anyway. To the government, they're just scroungers, they're just charity cases, they're just this, they're just that, but to our government, these poor, disadvantaged people certainly don't qualify for human beings. That's what capitalism does, that's why we need socialism, or communism, and we need it NOW. If we don't get that, equality is as far away from us as it could possibly be, because capitalism always leads to inequality, it kisses the hand of some people while spitting in the face of others.",

A good, true <b> communist </b>society is totally democratic, the government cannot do anything without the say so of the people. There are two forms of<b>  communist</b> government, one where a leader is chosen by a majority, but must always do as the people say, and one where there is no leader, but any law changes, new legislations are given to the public and decided by a vote. Had properly democratic systems been installed and maintained in Russia, Cuba, China or North Korea, true communism could've been achieved and they would have acted as beacons to the rest of the world, shining examples of countries full of happy people. Unfortunately, Russia had its Stalin, the DPRK has the Kims, China had its chairman Mao, and Cuba had its Castro. These people didn't share all of their power with the population of their respective countries, and in doing so made themselves more important, more powerful, than their fellows. If you look back to the ideal model of communism as I outlined earlier, you will see that all these people went against that ideal, and therefore are not true communists.\n\nPs I know that Lenin was the first Russia<b> n communis</b>t leader, I just don't like to condemn him so much, as he was the leader of a Russia at war, so we don't really know what kind of leader he would've been in peacetime. Also, more people know about Stalin, so it's easier to illustrate the point.",

An illiterate and innumerate person could have many skills which many literate and numerate people do not have. They could be much fitter, they could be much more perceptive, they could have better people skills. People seem to forget that a <b> communist </b>society still needs people with people skills, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, counsellors, civil servants, etc. These are all jobs that an innumerate or illiterate person could do. These people aren't worthless, they're just as valuable as you or I, by your logic Stephen hawking's value and benefit to society are measured by his illness, when anyone who knows the first thing about him will tell you that's not so. People with physical disabilities can have far better<b>  mental</b> skills than some people without, and those who are illiterate or innumerate have similar qualities. One argument, similar to yours, which says illiterate people should be disqualified from jobs because, apparently, they are unable to take notes, as all of the jobs I have listed above will count note-taking as a part of that. The primary school I went to, while mainly teaching children without special education needs, had a renowned and accomplished Supported Learning department, and one of the things they helped illiterate children, or those with dyslexia, do was to write notes in a form of shorthand similar to a picture, for short term use, and at the next opportunity, the children would record their notes on a dictaphone, and they were taught how to manage the MP3 files on a computer and so became good audio learners. This wouldn't be difficult for the jobs I've listed above. I had a music teacher who was dyslexic, and it had next to no impact on our lessons, all it meant was that the odd word may be slight misspelled when amending music. Just because someone is at a physical or neurological disadvantage to those around them, it doesn't mean they can't fulfil themselves and play a valuable role in society.",

People can still enjoy art, literature, religion, music, etc. but just as long as no one person or group of people is given less or greater access to these things than anyone else. It's not about everyone living in poverty, it's about everyone living with the same level of wealth. Many people think that works such as Orwell's 1984 represent proper communism, but they don't.

The majority of innate personal development takes place in infancy, when someone is still trapped in the circumstances into which they were most likely born. For instance, a person growing up in a white supremacist household is likely to develop white supremacist views themselves, as that's the environment they e grown up in. Just as equally, a person who's grown up in a house where they're always being put down or not have people bother about them will have learned ideas that they're not as able as other people, be it mentally, emotionally, spiritually or physically. Our circumstances influence every aspect of our lives, bar none.

And some of what you said was incorrect. The Egyptians, for instance, had hieroglyphs, and what are they if not a form of writing? It was<b>  African</b> societies who are thought to have invented the concept of trade and money. M not denying that, after leaving Africa, those who had left came on leaps and bounds, much faster than those still in Africa, but, again, those who had left were in more favourable environments. Also, you speak as though tribal societies were limited solely to Africa, but they weren't. I'm from Scotland, and up until the 19th century, we had a clan system in effect, particularly up in the highlands, and that is a form of tribalism, but those clans still intermingled, intermarried and traded with each other. Th<b> e Africa</b>n tribes were very much the same, it's only that as time went on, they began to grow hostile to one another, which was the situation the Europeans found them in in the 16th century. In fact, the local authorities actually traded with the Europeans when they went to Africa! In exchange for guns, metal products, etc, local chiefs and kings would give prisoners of war as slaves, or they would pay in spices or other goods. If you want to talk about Africa today, that's a very dangerous argument, because it's largely the fault of those Europeans, who, in the 16th century, stunted Africa's development, perhaps permanently, by removing their most able and their fittest, not to mention a large proportion of their fertile adults. You can't compare modern Africa with Europe, because Africa's prospects were greatly depleted in the 1540s, by Europeans.",

Tell me what do former <b> African </b>colonies have in<b>  common</b> that other European colonies such as India, The USA, Australia, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, etc etc? Why is it India who was conquered numerous times throughout history can move forward and advance whilst South Africa crumbles? Mmmmmm gee what could it be what could it be.....\n\nIn 2002, Wealth and the IQ of Nations posited frightfully low IQ numbers for Sub-Saharan Africa.  When the book's authors - Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen - recalculated the data in their 2006 update, IQ and Global Inequality, they arrived at equally abysmal figures: Sierra Leone (64), The Congo (65), Zimbabwe (66)<b> , Guine</b>a (66), Nigeria (69), The Gambia (66), Senegal (66), Mozambique (64), Gabon (64), Centr<b> al Afric</b>an Republic (64), Equator<b> ial Gui</b>nea (59), Liberia (67), Lesotho (67), Angola (68), Niger (67), South Africa (72).\nFor reference I believe the level for retardation is between 55-65.\n\nI put it to you that if you removed all western influence good or bad they'd be worse off, no infrastructure, no systems of governa<b> nce, not</b>hing, so where you look to the bad I see the potential good. Even today these countries and their corrupt leaders have<b>  done no</b>thing to further the cause of their people. Constant civil wars, disease, overpopulating and a reluctance to catch up to the rest of the world has done more damage than 10,000 years of European colonial rule would.\n\nIndia had it as bad as Sub-Saharan Africans but today they have excelled compared to Africa, why? Because when colonialism ended India kept the good things like the court system, they copied our laws, even<b>  today </b>Indian lawyers wear the barrister headgear. They took the infrastructure blueprint whereas Africa destroyed the infrastructure left behind by colonial nations as seen in South Africa today. India took advantage of what a relevantly superior system had to offer and built on it, Africa destroyed it, that's what 10-20 points of an IQ difference between nations achieved, no excuses.\n\nThis argument for me is like the <b> 50 y</b>ear old living is his mother basement still blaming his parents for his failures in life. No, stop fighting, start learning, get up off your lazy arse and get out there and do something with your life.",

It was a secular state, because they viewed religion as a capitalist exercise! Not only that, but after the anti-Jewish pogroms and Russification programs ore-revolution, Jews were persecuted and either killed or forced to become members of the Russian Orthodox Church. The Bolshevik government was entirely secular, and was not run by Jewish people! The world today is not run by Jewish people! The West is not run by Jewish people!

Secondly, US laws are totally irrelevant in this case, and you don't seem to be realising the motive behind the law being passed. What is important in any law is the reason it was passed, the problem it's trying to fix, and whether or not it fixes that problem. As shown by your good self, the law has not stopped anti-Semitism, which it was designed to do. Jews are legally considered a <b> race </b>in one country because, despite having so many amendments to their constitution, the Americans decided to go down this absurd route rather than passing another law which said that sectarianism will be treated the same way in a court of law as anti-Semitism. They could've thrown in<b>  homophobia</b>, transphobia, all the other kinds of discrimination in there while they were at it, but for some reason decided that they aren't proper forms of discrimination. And, with regard to the Jewish people, the US justice system mutilated the meaning of a biological term in the law, by making Jewish people <b> a rac</b>e of their own, despite the aforementioned lack <b> of comm</b>on ancestry or bodily features.",

If she was serious about <b> racism,</b> she wouldn't paint everyone with the same brush. What it feels like to me is they're expecting an apology from us, because of our ancestors. They will never let it go and will keep blaming us for their fucked up communities which they could easily fix themselves, but instead blame the rest of us for holding them back, when in reality they've had shit loads of chances to fix it. In other interviews when she's asked a tough question, she just does that stupid smirk and acts like we're all stupid who didn't understand her because of \"context\".  \n\nMany<b>  black</b> communities not only in the UK, but the US, live within this gang culture lifestyle. If <b> a blac</b>k guy who's well dressed, looks presentable walks on to a bu<b> s, nobo</b>dy would care, and would sit next to him happily, I certainly would. But even if it was a white,<b>  or bl</b>ack person with a hoodie who looked like they just walked off the council estate, then yes, some people might be a bit worried if it's late at night. That isn't racial profiling, it's culture profiling, by looking at how they dr<b> ess. No</b>body likes to judge others. But at a human instinct level, we assess possible risks and act on those risks by deciding to get up, or to get another bus. I grew up on a council estate, and in some places the kid<b> s are </b>crazy, and people are right to have reservations. \n\nThere is a lot more to societys problems tha<b> n just</b> black victimhood. It's an easy way for them to get let off the hook on many different things. This person is everything that is wrong with society today, rolled into one individual. These people are so conditioned, so brainwashed, they're too far gone to see reason. All thanks to liberalism being an enabling force, allowing shit like this to get to a point it makes headlines on national news.",

I do believe that the media has an agenda; however, I also feel like a lot of these issues of <b> race </b>have been ignored for decades and whenever someone of color speaks out about it, they are condemned.  It's like having a family secret and people keep bringing the subject up, but until it's resolved, the issue will always be there.  Just like there has always been a drug problem in the inner cities, but until it reached rural and suburban areas, no one cared.  Now, the government is spending thousands on drug rehab programs which should have been done a long time ago for the inner cities.  I believe that if most people take themselves, their egos, out of the situation, they would be able to understand and see another persons side clearly.  I have a clip of a white<b>  woman</b> of which I will attach to this comment to show how privileged white people are no matter how poor or rich they are.  It was an experiment that was done for years here in America.   [LINK]  I ask you to please take a look at this and I would really like to hear your insight on it.",

White farmers in south africa are being killed largely because their ancestors didn't know how to behave and the land wasn't theirs to claim. If you're going to tell me it was, then guess what; it's being reclaimed. BLM are assault in people largely because they're fed up with whites assaulting them.\n\nDo I condone any of this? No, but these things are happening largely as a reaction to previous events. America is a horribly fucked up mess in general and one of the reasons there's racial tension is that like South Africa it has made every effort to segregate whites from blacks despite forcing them to share the same country. Here In the UK, integration has been historically encouraged and so we only occasionally get idiots like this who want to import victimhood and are given far more publicity than they deserve.",

                    "commentText": "Johnny Caruthers I'll be surprised if you read all of this, so I just want to get a few quick points out of the way at the very start.\n\nFirst, there is a \"White Lives Matter\" you donkey. It's called the alt-right, the movement was started by self proclaimed white supremacist Richard Spencer and the movement is currently in league with nazis and white nationalists (who will try to deny this despite sharing pretty much all the values of the other 2 groups). I have a strong feeling that you're familiar with them or at least their rhetoric, since in another comment I've just read you claim that \"the left\" (as if it's a monolith) has \"demeaned\" (not the word I'd pick, but okay) the meaning of the word \"<b> racism\"</b>. This is \"alt-right\" speak if I ever heard it.\n\nYou brought up white farmers in South Africa being killed and I gave you a bit of perspective. I know it's irritating when pertinent facts get in the way of feelings, but there they are.\n\nI also have a very simple question before I get to the bulk of my comment: should a policeman or<b>  woman</b> be held to a higher standard than som<b> e dum</b><b> b, bla</b>ck criminal?\n\nAffirmative Action in America should be changed, but so should the entire college admissions system. If anything, there should be a form of Affirmative Action aimed directly at smart kids who may not have the resources at home to get the kind of education that will allow them to excel in life. Rich people should not be able to buy their way into the best colleges.\n\nYour assertion that whites are losing out on jobs because of affirmative action rings false<b> . A bl</b>ack person hired for a job must still meet the criteria for the position. To say otherwise is to say that businesses don't care who they hire if they can't hire a white person and that they're willing to break the law just to <b> hire et</b>hnic minorities and women, which is a profoundly stupid thing to believe. Also, someone is going to be hired, which means there will be people, white and otherwise, who were perfectly qualified who didn't get the job. That's how the job market works. I'm guessing you're still quite young if you're not aware of this?\n\nAfter all that, I must say that since we don't have such a thing as \"Affirmative Action\" in the UK, I'm not personally invested in the issue.\n\nYou seem to want me to be a spokeman for BLM, but in my final paragraph I made it clear that I don't condone their actions.\n\n\"Do I condone any of this? No\" - Me, in my original comment. AS I'VE ALSO ALREADY SAID, they absolutely do not belong in the UK. The UK and USA are completely different cultures, in that one of us has a rich and diverse one and the other is basically a money-cen<b> tric,</b> race obsessed toxic mess with a gun fetish.\n\nI think that BLM are unhelpful in their current form and the fact that people have committed crimes in their name in a manner that is unquestionably related to their core issue (i.e. they are against police violence against blacks and blacks have killed police in the name of BLM) makes them untenable whether they endorse the actions or not. Having said all that, I doubt we could have any kind of meaningful conversation about them because I'm willing to bet that you've never read their own mission statement, instead choosing to believe whatever their critics have to say (i.e. t<b> hey're </b>racist, terrorists, they call for the death of police (who come in all racial flavours but let's conveniently leave that fact out), they don't car<b> e abou</b>t <b> black </b>on black crime, etc.)?",

The US killed 225,000 of its own men trying to keep people in bondage and chattel slavery.  The Civil War ended to stop the country from killing even more of its own citizens.  A hundred years after the Civil War, all people of color were simply \"<b> colored\"</b> and had to live under legal segregation and<b>  Jim Cr<b> ow</b</b>> laws.  It wasn't until the early 1970s that most legal discriminatory laws were abolished them.  None of this is the fault of a<b> ny Afric</b>an or Muslim.  The fact that a lot of people have slaves d<b> oes noth</b>ing to explain away why the US had federal laws base<b> d on </b>race for 300 years.  Lets fixate not deflect.  Slavery is wrong every single time.  The most conservative estimates of slave labor amount to 8 trillion dollars of free labor, all of it earned on US soil.  Reparations were promised at the end of the Civil War Era.  Why would Muslims disburse what Americans promised their own people?",

Meanwhile, much more people where opposed to it, and also fought and DIED to free the slaves. And when they won, they ended slavery worldwide (in places they could influence). Where would we be without those anti slavery laws? Well, again, you don't need to look further than Africa and the middle east that STILL practice slavery. So yeah, rather than as you say \"people deflecting slavery\" on what other happened in other countries, i'd actually ask the question the other way around - why is everyone (like you) FOCUSING on the US who's slave trade lasted the least time, and who actually ended the practice pretty much worldwide? Oh, yeah, i know - that's not where the money's at! If you shame Muslims for their slave trade and slaughter that they took part in all throughout their history and that pales in contrast to what everyone else did, they will not only not apologize, or give you money, they'll tell you to fuck off, or worse. Obviously easier to yell at the polite, self critical white guy who will vomit a steady stream of apologies and money your way...",

This is a capitalist society.  The means of production and the wealth is designed to be in the hands of the few, not the many.  During American slavery, the slaves themselves were the wealth.  They were the assets and virtually all big banks, big universities, big agra, and big business was built from that industry.  Adjusted for inflation, one slave was worth about 250k in profit and the profit of the future slave was equity that loans were taken out against.  Derivatives on those loans were sold which propped up many of the companies and industries we still rely on today.  I focus on US slavery because I am an American descendant of those slaves.  I can't speak for any other country or any other tribe of people.  Muslims and Africans can tell their slaves to do whatever they wish.  40 acres and a mule was promised to emanicpated slaves by the federal government in this <b> nation </b>and they did not follow through on their promise.  You can focus on the obvious result of capitalism which is that the wealth, which were slaves, were held in the hands of the few or the fact that EVERY Native born<b>  African</b> American is a descendant of slaves.  Before 1980 there was virtually no immigration allowed b<b> y blac</b>k people from any country on the planet.  So anyo<b> ne bla</b>ck in America with a native born grandparent is a descendant of chattel slavery and bondage.  That means that grandparent went to legally segregated schools, lived in legally segregated neighborhoods, and were legally locked out of employment and financial products solely because of th<b> eir r</b>ace through the 1970s. I have four of those grandparents and two parents that went through the same.",

And that's despite it being worse in my case - there was not only segregation, racial discrimination, taking over property, slave labor, but also an eventual all out genocide. Also, seems you don't get how progress and finance works. Slavery is a non profitable business on a country-sized scale, it is only good for manual labor, and it actually KEEPS PROGRESS AND AUTOMATION AWAY, so if you think such a huge country owes all of its success and riches to a handful of physical laborers... Well, might want to go check your IQ. And \"doesn't matter how many owned slaves\"? REALLY? Not only that most where not involved in this, and that those who did own slaves are long gone, but you acknowledged yourself that the oppression was from the government and the powerful, and people can't exactly influence it at all.. Unless they go to war. And that's EXACTLY what they did. Actually there might have been a bigger percentage of AFRICANS involved in the slave trade than there was slave owners in America. Did the Africans go to war against them? Did any of those responsible for it in the past and their children feel guilty? Would you, and a lot of others would even be here talking if not for the American anti-slavery laws and worldwide involvement? Slavery existed since the dawn on mankind, and it was practiced until very recently, as you know (If you exclude Africa and the middle east where its still a thing)... For all i know, without America's anti slave involvement, this shitty practice could have still been legal worldwide, and yet here we are, having people from all over shaming the first, and only country in the world who fought to free its slaves,  and outlaw slavery all over the world. You're going about this in modern logic, but back then, people lived less, where far less educated and open to ideas, there was no internet, barely any public libraries, no automation, bad healthcare and a shitload of other problems to take care of.. And so they did just that - took care of all the biggest problems first. Do you think in such hard times, with such bad conditions people are like now, ready to learn and accept new ideas and change prejudice? Well, they're not. Only when the things finally stabilized after the industrial revolution and all the world wars that they got to the question of racial segregation.",

Not only does Germany still pay reparations toward Jewish DESCENDANTS of holocaust victims, the US paid Jews even though their bondage was not in this country?  If your dad built a house but died on the day he was supposed to receive the check, do you mean to tell me you wouldn't be there to collect it on his behalf?  Our labor was stolen from us.  Our land was stolen from us.  Are we supposed to forget about it because it happened to our grandparents?  Am I supposed to forget about my grandparents that were hung from trees, castrated, and set on fire while an entire society watched, pointed, and laughed? Some fought for the slaves.  Many fought to keep them in bondage.  It bears repeating.  It doesn't matter how many societies have or had slaves. All of it is wrong, and all slaves are due reparations from being stolen from.  The lack of technology is not an excuse to steal people from their homeland and bring them to yours in chains.  If they are dead, their families are owed that money.  The wealth created from slavery is still in the economy today just like the poverty it created by stealing from people.  Reparations were promised by the federal government at the time slavery ended.  How many countries promised their slaves reparations and then didn't pay when it was time to write the check?",

That's exactly my point, and its easily proven by that blacks where doing much better before this welfare, racebating, and self-victimization started a couple of decades ago. It actually broke the<b>  black</b> family that was doing really well before, and wouldn't even break back under segregation and even slavery.

And \"the government\"  doesn't own or produce anything, therefore you're saying \"the people\" owe redress to the victims, and guess who pays that?

You really sound like you're too desperate to label all white people as racists when it was white people that ended slavery, gave us a civilisation worth living in, one that we all benefit from now, not just whites. I think it is fair to say that <b> black </b>people have it way better than other<b>  black</b> people in their ancestral, native countries but it is never enough. \n\nThi<b> s woma</b>n is a successful trans model and would she be able to do that in any other non-weste<b> rn nati</b>on and be lauded for it? Some places, maybe but most will not. She was given the chance to show her success off to people who can look up to her but nah, she had to play the s<b> ame </b>old tired victim crap. \n\nEven if all this was true... What good does it do going on about it? Is it helping people in their lives or is it an unnecessary hindrance to it? I keep thinking about Morgan Freeman when these matters come up, who said the only way to <b> stop ra</b>cism is to stop going on about it. He is right. I don't refer to you as a white man and you don't refer to me<b>  as a </b>black man and see how it goes. It was working quite well, until teachers began filling students heads with nonsense about white privilege and syst<b> ematic </b>racism. Now, ALL white peo<b> ple are</b> racist? GTFOH with that shit.\n\nYou can't just cherry pick shite examples from history and use that as a basis of today. If you don't feel safe living among white people or if you are unhappy with how things are being done, then leave. Go elsewhere or help shape the society you want to see and I'm sorry but calling whit<b> e peopl</b>e racist<b>  based o</b>n nothing but the fact that they are white is backward, ignorant and helps neither blacks or whites and it is not the way forward. We all understood this 20 years ago, so now we are obs<b> essed</b> with race again and oh dear, look, it is causing more division. Who would've guessed it?\n\nIt is ridiculous to keep goi<b> ng on</b> about race. It makes you wonder why even bother, in being a good, morally well a<b> djusted</b>, non-racist human being, if you are going to walk down the street to be told that no matter how good you are, yo<b> u are s</b>till a racist because some stupid moron 200 years ago did <b> someth</b>ing to a black man that was cruel and unjust. Never mind the white people who have been slaves or the Asians<b>  or E</b>VERY other race on <b> the pl</b>anet. Only black people suffered in history, <b> no on</b>e else. It's dumb.\n\nThe PAST... We do not live there, we have no right to j<b> udge </b>people of ANY race based on the past, only the here and now, yet it continues and continues and people defend it like it is going to do something other than degrade relations further. It is quite simply moronic.",

Have you ever took the time to try to find out how you can help to make things better?\n\nI will give you a couple of examples for you to look for, hopefully, you can find something that you can begin to have the conversation about in a real way. In the education system, have you ever realized that more financial dollars and allocate to districts with fewer minorities although the districts with minorities have more of the need and high populations? In the criminal justice system have you ever realized that minorities are stopped, confined, charged, plead or found guilty, and get longer sentences than those who are not minorities. As for voter rights, have you ever realized in certain places that the requirements are specifically aimed at canceling out minority votes, by putting the resources out of reach for many people who have limited resources, who happen to be predominately minorities? In social assistance programs, have you ever realized that there is a constant cry about minorities being on public assistance and not getting off, but the fact is minorities are not proportionately the ones that are using public assistance? And further more that the programs needed to help people get off of these programs are extremely lacking in only minority communities. \n\nI could go on and on but I just wanted to give you a taste of the problems that minorities face that everyone seems to want to ignore as long as they are taking care of. These problems that I mentioned are not based on one specific country you can find these examples almost throughout all \"western countries.\" \n\nI am not saying that there are many countries that are trying to fix these types of issues, but I am saying that there is still a lot of work to be done and until we have honest conversations about these issues then they won't get fixed. \n\nI think it is on all of modern societies and their citizens to start having the hard conversations so that we can finnd real fixes for what is limiting the posibilities of today and tomorrow for us all.",

The only way things continue to get better is if people address what is wrong. The only way that happens is by people who have attained some type of a platform. He chooses to ignore the reality that many others have to face and that works on a personal level, but it doesn't work for a society. Luckily we have more people in the world that don't share his thoughts who find ways to fight and talk for those who don't have a voice.\n\nYour answer for solving the problems in society is to run and move to somewhere else, what happens to those that come behind you. Should they then have to do the same thing? You lose or stop being aliened with <b> racism </b>and all those other hate groups when you do the moral thing and stand up for those who don't have the ability to speak and be heard. \n\nOne of the most important things that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said was that his call was not to those who live in hate, but to those who stand by and watch. Those who are stand idol in the fight against hatred in all its forms.\n\nInstead of getting angry about what she is saying, try listening to what she is trying to say. Instead of ignoring the conversation, try having these conversations with people who identify as you do. Instead of ignoring the past, how about you can try and find ways to expand the future for yourself and others. That is how you can help create a better future for all of us. Being a good moral person is about more than just doing for yourself and yours, it is about doing what is in the best interest of the community as well.",

It was invented by the Frankfurt School and involved criticizing everyone and everything ad nauseum. Marxists found that Socialism in itself was unpopular and hard to implement, so rather than create, they aimed to destroy the fabric of traditional society and replace it with their phony, destructive ideology. Their goal was to use endless criticism to deconstruct traditional values and morality, and shift away from objective truth. Frankfurt School intellectuals started teaching in Californian universities and found that groups such as <b> LGB<b> T <<b> /b</b</b>>>people and blacks lapped it up, as it was biased in their favour, and involved silencing people who were viewed as 'oppressive' i.e. white people - coincidentally almost all of the Frankfurt School intellectuals were Jewish. Critical theory is now commonly used by SJWs and the left. Basically it is a meaningless word salad, full of projecting, half truths, buzzwords, personal bias, self victimization and pseudo-psychology. Despite having little to no basis in reality, it is now taught to college students as fact. Marxism is, effectively, a form of brainwashing, and the only reason it thrives is because useful idiots believe it.",

                    "commentText": "+Jorge Gomes\n\nOf course, if a single person were to attempt to save one person when two people are drowning *at the same time*, there is no right or wrong choice regarding which one you save (but that's kind of the point\u2013geography makes it no more or less moral).  However, the analogy was not about having to choose one or the other within a set time frame (which you've added), which is a slightly different philosophical problem akin to the Trolley problem. This dilemma addresses whether geography has any impact on the morality of a single act. Your addition to the problem of a time constraint and choice removes the possibility of helping two people who might be drowning at different times. \n\nHowever, I would argue that <b> nationalism </b>is a kin not only to saving the first girl but taking her to the movies and buying her a coke and a puppy while actively drowning the girl six metres away. It's near impossible for nationalist self-interest to not result in harm to others as evidenced by history. \n\nWe've had several hundred years of<b>  nationalism</b>, I would argue that colonialism is the inevitable result o<b> f nationalis</b>m when countries venture outside their own borders in order to serve their own interests (whether for gold, oil or slaves). The two world wars in the last century were fuelled by the fires of Western hegemony and the need to assert a national self-interest. The search for assets to support an ever growing population results in harm to others. I would assert those very few nations in the West were able to sustain their countries without invading or marginalizing others. The alternative is to be marginalized by anoth<b> er nati</b>on or to adopt the kind<b>  of national</b>ism akin to North Korea, which raises a whole series of other ethical issues. Given its Nuclear program, however, I see little evidence that its behavior as a nationa<b> list na</b>tion is any different to all the others. The third option is globalisation\u2013the UK's decision to join the EEC, for instance, was financially motivated at a time when the UK was known as the sick man of Europe. \n\n+Matthew 2504 but it isn't our responsibility to help them\n\nMorality is the principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behaviour. We generally accept that allowing harm is less bad than being the perpetrator of harm but allowing someone to come to harm is less moral than helping them, standing by and watching a child drown is objectively immoral. \n\nThere should, however, be an objection\u2014indeed, an outcry\u2014at our failure to prevent the deaths of millions of children in the third world from malnutrition, dehydration, and measles (Standford encyclopedia of philosophy, 2017).",

My original question was why is patriotism moral. I posed this question originally because the OP implied that it was somehow the 'right' choice. This seems to be something that people believe, but there's still been no justification as to why it is moral. Your characterisation of the real world doesn't make the actions or inactions of those nations anymore or less objectively moral. \n\nI can guarantee you that the ruling elite in most of the regions where millions of children died didn't have a single sleepless night about them and probably even helped in causing their deaths\n\nI appreciate you are attempting to make a wider point but this comment (and those leading up to it) teeters on the relative privation fallacy. Assuming your statement is true, how does that make our inactions any more or less moral? \n\nThen we have the Globalist agenda -a small group of Multinational Corporations governed by an even smaller group of multi billionaires consolidating most of the World's wealth in their hands, do you think they are going to ensure equitable distribution of resources\n\nThis is probably the smartest thing I've read on this thread so far. What we disagree on is the label used to describe these inherently aggressively capitalist organisations. These have arisen partly as the result of an impotent government unable to vet these enormous organisations, whose activities often fall outside of the country's jurisdiction. How do we ensure that they function to serve the will of the people? What confuses me is the characterisation (or implication) of this enormous capitalist, free market motivated machines as 'socialist'.  \n\nI agree these organisations exist. I also agree they are a problem. The question is what do we do about it? What mechanism would we have that could stand up to these organisations? What impact has <b> Brexit </b>or Trump had on reversing these enormous global empires, many of which exist outside their country's laws? \n\nLet's take a hypothetical: If Texas decided to raise its tax on companies then a large national corporation could simply move its main base of operations across state lines. That way, it can evade those aggressive tax laws and move to another state which is more favourable towards the 1%. The only way that you can ensure this company (we'll call it BigCorp) doesn't take jobs out of Texas but pays reasonable levels of tax is to introduce state wide legislation. However, statewide legislation means that states are now bound together in a way they were not before. This analogy attempts to show the dilemma of globalisation (and perhaps the more recent<b>  Brexit</b> debacle). Long gone are the days when a single country can stand up to such a corporation because they can simply move to another country.",

However, I think it's fitting as a response to your internet claim: \n\nLong before the technology existed to actually build the Internet, many scientists had already anticipated the existence of worldwide networks of information. Nikola Tesla toyed with the idea of a 'world wireless system' in the early 1900s, and visionary thinkers like Paul Otlet and Vannevar Bush conceived of mechanized, searchable storage systems of books and media in the 1930s and 1940s. Still, the first practical schematics for the Internet would not arrive until the early 1960s, when MIT's J.C.R. Licklider popularized the idea of an 'Intergalactic Network' of computers. Shortly thereafter, computer scientists developed the concept of 'packet switching,' a method for effectively transmitting electronic data that would later become one of the major building blocks of the Internet (Evans, 2013) \n\nOtlet was belgian, Vannevar Bush was american, and Tesla was Serbian. \n\nWhilst it is certainly true that inventors and mathematicians who happened to be British made significant contributions to our modern internet, your statement would seem to be a moral conclusion based on hasty generalizations. Since we do not have access to a parallel universe where the British empire never existed and, hence, the impact this would have on the technology of Human civilization is at best unknown; we can say with little authority what that world would look like. \n\nThere is a difference between romantic notions of science and reality. Science tends to be a collaborative effort with multiple contributors, and influences (without Einstein's theory of relativity, we wouldn't have GPS on our Sat Navs and the clocks on our mobiles phones would be inaccurate); discoveries tend to be built upon those of previous generations. \n\nThe multiple discovery theory tends to reject the romanticised heroic theory of invention and discovery, which ignores the countless examples of simultaneous scientific and mathematical discoveries throughout history. For example, the 18th-century discovery of oxygen by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Joseph Priestley or the simultaneous evolutionary models of Darwin and Russell (Wiki, 2017). It's interesting to note that messages sent into space by NASA and SETI (Search for extra terrestrial intelligence) often include basic scientific and mathematical principles, signifying a belief by some, that much of our science and maths is innate, whose discovery, by an intelligent, sentient species capable of traversing the stars, is inevitable. Do we know for certain that if Edison were never born the light bulb would never have been invented? (He wasn't the only person to claim this invention). And, what would Great Britain look like without the centuries of Roman influence? \n\nYour countryman, Jimmy Savile, raped and abused hundreds of children but raised millions to make the lives of many significantly better. Does one cancel out the other? A crass example, but apt for this discussion.",

                    "commentText": "+Matthew 2504\nI realise now that what I wrote perhaps makes it look like I don't disagree with slavery\n\nNot at all, I didn't think for a second that you think slavery is ok. I don't doubt your intentions, and I do understand the feelings of patriotism. I think I also understand that what you believe you are referring to is a kind of benign/benevolent patriotism\u2013my position is that this too is problematic. \n\nBut what I am trying to get at is that the British empire lead to huge changes and made the world what it is today\n\n\u2026And what is the world today? I'm arguing that we have no basis for comparison i.e. a world without the British Empire is something we can never know. Who are we to say that such a world would be a better or worse place. In any case, huge changes, whether positive or not, does not expunge the Empire of centuries of wrong doing. \n\nAt the time, the bad things we did were not considered bad, and people grew up being told certain things were acceptable that simply aren't now\n\nIt's called moral relativism, the child who grows up in a malevolent religious cult probably does not know his or her views are skewed or immoral. But if they venture out into the world and commit an objectively evil act, is it still evil (both ethically and legally) even if they do not know it is the wrong thing to do. And besides, there were many acts by the empire that would have been considered immoral, even at the time. \n\nIs it less bad to murder someone last week, or last month than it is to murder someone two days ago? Does the passage of time make an evil act any less objectively immoral? If I murdered someone does my giving millions to charity expunge my crime? \n\nBut still, you can't seriously argue that it is wrong to be proud of one's achievements\n\nI am arguing that some one's achievements are independent of country. In all probability, Newton would have devised his third law if he was French or German.  \n\n\nWe controlled half the world from a small island, that is a great achievement\n\nI think 'great' is a point of view. What is great about controlling people? \n\nMany people have different ideologies so it is probably hard for you to fully understand what I am saying as it contrasts with your beliefs\n\nI completely understand what you are saying, and you've expressed yourself very clearly. But, I disagree with your premise. For me, it would be disingenuous to be proud of the achievements of other Brits whom I had no influence or contact with without also taking on the shame of our failures.",

They weren't living in thriving societies that the Europeans could only dream of making. How do you think Europeans managed to get to these places? We were already rich, sophisticated and powerful. We didn't NEED resources from Africa to be powerful, we went there because it's a nice little bonus and for the thrill of being conquerors going into the unknown. For you to say that Europe is built on the backs of Africans is retarded. \n\nThe blacks sold their own people to us, we didn't take them against their will. The village elders would trade them like livestock. \n\nThe only decent countries in Africa are the ones that were colonised and even now they're starting to crumble because they're trying to live like Europeans when they're not, they're Africans and they should live how they're meant to.",
