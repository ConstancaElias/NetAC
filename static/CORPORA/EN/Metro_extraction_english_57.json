        "postText": "Free bleeding has been gaining traction at the forefront of women\u2019s health activism, touted as the cool, radical feminist way to menstruate and to protest.', 'But when we\u2019re fighting for untaxed and readily available sanitary products for all women, is discarding them altogether fair?', 'Those who chose to free bleed, purposely abstaining from wearing feminine hygiene products during their period, usually do so for two reasons: comfort, and the environment. Most pads and tampons contain plastic and toxins that are harmful to both the body and our planet, so you\u2019d be forgiven for believing that there are no downsides to giving up period products.', 'However, it\u2019s a choice many women don\u2019t have.', 'Thousands of homeless women, girls living below the poverty line, and asylum seekers in the UK suffer each month because pads and tampons are far too expensive for them, forced to resort to using toilet paper, old rags or nothing at all during their time of the month. Many women have to miss work or school (49% according to Plan International UK), and others do their best to stay hidden from the public because of the cultural stigma surrounding periods.', 'Menstrual blood has the unique power to gross out even the least squeamish, and it speaks volumes that the sight of it makes people uncomfortable when we\u2019re constantly exposed explicitly and gratuitously violent, gory or sexual images.', 'Instagram deleted artist and poet Rupi Kaur\u2019s post (twice) because it showed a woman with menstrual blood on her sweatpants, and musician and activist Kiran Gandhi faced harsh criticism when she free-bled while running the London Marathon.', 'Periods are still used against women as a tool to shun and subjugate us, so intentionally free bleeding has not only become a way to reclaim our bodies but also to confront the reality and social stigma of menstruation. But there\u2019s a classist caveat to this bloody grassroots activism.', 'For anyone with a period sanitary products are a basic necessity, but they don\u2019t come cheap. Unfortunately buying and using them is a luxury many women can\u2019t afford.', '\u2018When the choice is between buying enough food for your family and pads for yourself, women are forced to go without,\u2019 Affi Parvizi-Wayne, founder organic period subscription service Freda, tells Metro.co.uk. \u2018Sanitary products are a basic essential, so a lack of access to them impacts women at a fundamental level.\u2019', 'When, in 2018, we\u2019re still protesting, marching and petitioning for them to be easily accessible to all women, choosing to give them up altogether is in itself a privilege.', 'Homeless women bleed freely not by choice, but because it\u2019s their only option. For them it\u2019s not a \u2018f*** you\u2019 to the patriarchy, or a way to boycott the Tampon Tax, or even an eco-conscious statement, it\u2019s just a burden.', '\u2018I think it is an immense privilege to be able to free bleed,\u2019 says Gabby Edin, founder of Bloody Good Period, a non-profit that provides free period products to asylum seekers, refugees and those who can\u2019t afford them. \u2018I do understand, from a radical feminist standpoint, where it\u2019s coming from but many of the women we work with are free bleeding because they literally didn\u2019t have any other choice.\u2019', 'Edin founded Bloody Good Period after volunteering at an asylum seekers\u2019 drop-in centre and learning that female hygiene products weren\u2019t on the list of essential donations.', '\u2018We need to give these women the respect that they deserve and realise that [period products] are absolutely essentials, they\u2019re necessary to get by day to day when you\u2019re on your period,\u2019 she tells us.', 'Freely bleeding on your period is easy enough when you\u2019re in the comfort of your own home or have access to a washing machine, a clean, safe bathroom and fresh clothes, all things most of us take for granted.', '\u2018We\u2019re not at the point right now where we can be open with our periods,\u2019 says Edin, \u2018Especially if you\u2019re living in poverty, it can cause a huge amount of shame.\u2019', 'Practical issues aside, free bleeding is a completely different matter in public spaces.', 'Women grow up understanding in no uncertain terms that unexpectedly bleeding through your clothes in public is the most mortifying thing that could happen to them, but while accidents happen to everyone, leaking because you can\u2019t afford something as vital as pads or tampons isn\u2019t just an embarrassing anecdote from your youth, it\u2019s a debilitating reality.', '\u2018Periods are a natural and normal process but it\u2019s the societal stigma around them that has led to this situation where they\u2019re preventing women from going about their daily life with dignity,\u2019 says Parvizi-Wayne, who founded Freda out of frustration over the taboos that caused the menstrual needs of women in refugee camps to be overlooked.', 'Although free-bleeding has become a personal-is-political call to action, a way to openly experience and discuss periods for what they are \u2013 normal and healthy \u2013 on its own it\u2019s not enough of a statement to fight period poverty, Edin believes.', '\u2018There\u2019s no reason to tell anybody not to free bleed, if that\u2019s what they want to do then that is brilliant and go for it, but as somebody working in the area of period poverty I don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly helpful to our cause, because it is an absolute luxury.\u2019', 'Ironically, boycotting something the government considers a luxury is a luxury in of itself.', 'Free bleeding may allow us to unlearn what society has taught to feel about periods, but it doesn\u2019t change the reality that while some of us may have the choice, others don\u2019t.', 'Every woman can and should have the right to choose how to menstruate regardless of income, and when we\u2019re breaking the taboo around periods we can\u2019t forget to include the experiences of all women.', 'Failing to recognise that free bleeding \u2013 for all its good \u2013 is a privilege, means failing to recognise the humanity of the thousands of women in the UK (and all over the world, for that matter) who are subjugated and made to be ashamed of their bodies.",

            "commentText": "If you're into free bleeding and can wash your clothes regularly, errmm...great, carry on. But when poverty is added into the equation, it is far from a 'privilege'. I know that some of the young girls I work with have no money to buy pads or tampons. They also come from families that may not have regular access to a washing machine. There are some girls who on top of this have poor hygiene skills and may well be wearing the same knickers for 3 days in a row and not showered for a week. Periods are a fact of life for most women. Privilege is not 'choosing to go without' sanitary products. Privilege is being able to afford or access those products. Privilege is being able to wash soiled underwear regularly. And until the government stops taxing sanitary products, for many women and girls, periods will cause them to feel underprivileged and excluded from society.",
