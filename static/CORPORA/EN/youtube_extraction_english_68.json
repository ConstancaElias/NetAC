            "commentText": "It's sad to see that so many people here are happy to dismiss some of the terrible things said in this show simply because \"oh they're geeks! They don't fit in and have trouble getting women just because they're quirky and nerdy, but trust me, they're the nice guys I swear.\" when the show literally has instances where the main characters commit crimes of <b> sexual </b>harassment. If the main characters were very masculine and confident (like 'jocks') it would come across as creepy and demeaning. You can't shut down everyone who calls out something you like by calling them oversensitive and<b>  crazy</b>. Accept that it isn't right and it isn't fair. There i<b> s nothin</b>g wrong with believing that both genders deserve equal amounts of respect. Yes, men do get treated unfairly but no where near enough as women do, it's not a game of who's worse off, it's a fucking social issue. The show sometimes acknowledges t<b> he sexi</b>sm of its jokes through lampshading, but there is a difference between acknowledging and trying to s<b> top sex</b>ism. The writers lampshade jokes so they can get away with sexist<b>  and ra</b>cist jokes without paying the repercussions. The examples in this video aren't very good in all honesty so try watching this video with an open mind :)  [LINK] ",

Do anyhting they can to stop her leaving and make her feel as if she s the one who manipulates them.\n After all of this, she gets a job that makes her sad and makes her drink and leonard remains the goodey of the series though he does all he can to keep her in this high paying but dishonest and soul destroying job. He says his mother is bad but she at least made him get a high kudos job. that does not make him feel desperate. He says he loves Penny and keeps her down. his education also seems to allow him to hold his own with Penny and more or less with Sheldon even, while they all use and abuse Penny, enjoying her company all while they  pretend that she does <b> nothing </b>for them. \n The program continuously makes reference to how soul destroying Pennies job selling medicines is and how she is conscious of this. I think it invites us,  the audience to complain about his behaviour but it seems we don't, because the Penny Leonard trajectory,  goes on being the same, about as sexist as the KIll Bill Beatrice Kido one is, in which, much as every thing we know about the relationship indicates that Bill controls Beatrice, untill the second last scene, all their friends say they hold the belief that Beatrice controls Bill, that she is the one who controles him. This fact, that he has convinced all that she manipulateds him, much as the opposite is evidente, mirrors real life in which men usually have more control of the life trajectory of the couple but not about putting their feet on the table, while they say that women control them. \n Leonards teatment of Penny's situation and her hopes and fears, given her much expressed disgust of her role at wor, so her evident understand of how evil this job is,  is so mean that he is even begining to look more and more unattractive, as his nasty role just holds for longer and longer.",

The show has other female leads that are just as attractive as Penny and boast an education far superior than any of you snowflakes will ever have (e.g Bernadette)I'm not surprised at all ; people have been changing the meaning of words just so they can further their agenda. Sad really.\nNext time you attempt to bash a sitcom with perfectky acceptable characters look for better examples because none of these clips exemplify how Penny has been belittled by the sole fact she's a <b> woman.</b> Because that really is<b>  sexism</b>.\nExamples of other attractive females with Higher education:\nPriya , Emily , Stephanie , Alex",

The more I think about it the more I realise that Leonard is probably more interested in how penny looks then her personality. I think penny just wants to settle down and be loved somehow and therefore goes for the sweetest person to her who would never hurt her. I mean lets be honest her ex boyfriends have all been hot and <b> dumb </b>like her, why not switch it up and not get hurt by them anymore, not get cheated on and go for the safety shot. No offence to either of them but I think they shouldn't have gotten together because now they are boring and constantly trying to sort out their marriage. I know penny and Leonard seemed to be a cute couple but I preferred Leonard and Priya.",

This show is cringe worthy. The laugh track is heard more than the dialogue. The joke seems to be that the characters engage in sexist attitude, but are so unmasculine that the attitude is not harmful. Which is completely false. It implies that<b>  sexism</b> ultimately is not harmful if your main characters casually partake in it. The context of the joke is not that these men are wrong in their thinking, rather that they are not masculine enough to believebly pull it off.

They can't find it within themselves to be respectful of women or be confident to be who they are, they need a <b> woman </b>to tell them how to live.\n\nNot only that, it's a misrepresentation of nerd culture in general.

Men are sexist, women are controlling, and the majority of people are <b> racist.</b> However, none of us make a big deal out of it and play the victim because for millions of years it's kept our species in peak form. When all you females parade men to be awful creature's  and put women on a pedestal you are the ones being sexist. You're all hypocritical. You seem to forget that it's men who build the entire world you live in. Who build Rome? men. Who build the USA? men. Who build great Britain? men.\nwho created governments? men. Who invented that technology in your hand? men. Everyone should thank men for the sacrifices they've made over hundreds of thousands of years to make sure their families had food, clothing and a warm house.

I have known so many manipuyative people, whatching the show whatching Sheldon helps me understand them and how they have manipulated me. I whatch every trick of Sheldons so that in future I recognise it when somone plays on one his tricks on me.  \n In my experience the manipulative dotn hold people together they drive them apart so this is an unrealistic bit of the program.\n Leonard stands up to him and at first Amie Farrow Fowler does not, the result is that he is bored by her. This may be often what bores men about girlfriends, women are too nice to their boyfriends, behave in a way with them they would not indulge in with other women. \n   The show is not really about good professionales, it is about those whose first interest is their friends, awful as these are.

All of the examples of <b> sexism </b>that you listed are not aimed at women in general, but are character traits of one female character. And, there are two other female leads (and one supporting character) that are the opposite of Penny. It may be your opinion that those two \"come across as<b>  crazy</b> and bossy\", but I actually prefer Bernadette and Amy to Penny because they are smart, successful, and all around better people than Penny. I'm a guy, and I would choose Bernadette over Penny in a heartbeat. And the guys on the show are not \"All guys\". They are nerdy, introverted guys and that is the staple of the show. That is also why they \"blindly desire\" Penny. Think of it this way: When everybody says \"I want to be a movie-star\", all they actually want is the money and fame. What they don't want is the familial dysfunction, abortions, and plastic surgeries up into their 80s just to look attractive. It's the same way with Penny. People want the looks, but they don't want the alcoholism, career failure, and stupidity. She represents a guilty pleasure, not a role model and most people see it.",

It's the start of them showing good platonic relationships between sexes (something a lot of shows have a hard time doing). Penny has her own life, that is discussed frequently on the show. They don't show it as much cause that would require them to hire more actors make more sets, and it really doesn't fit with the theme of the show.",

That's a very stupid, idiot thing to say!! Penny IS sexy for the vast majority of people, men and women.\nAs they appear in the show lined up Penny would be the most desirable by pretty much every group of men followed by Bernadette then Amy for very obvious reasons.\nPenny is tall, beautiful and is quite smart in her own way.\nBurnadette is very short but looking closely at her (past the never ending breast covering sweaters) she is also quite sexy (large breast and tiny waist). The fact that she has a bad temper is offputting for some men but the fact that she is supersmart and generous offsets this.\n\nAmy dresses rather unattractively and this would be a big turnoff for most men. Her being smart and quite nice looking is something that a man would have to find out having gone past the linguistic turns she has and the rather offputting manner .\n\nHow are any of those some type o<b> f sexis</b>m? They are all based on real people I have encountered.\nLets take myself as an example. I like all three women  but Penny would be my first choice and here is why.\n\nI could not deal with Bernadettes bad temper no matter how generous and smart she is.\n\nWhile Amy is obviously super horny and would be great in bed she just does not appeal to me as the character \"Amy\" although I am attracted to her reasonableness and tendency to be diplomatic.\n\nPenny would be an obvious choice in that she is quite smart, has an opinion, has the right mix of humility and go fuck yourself, is willing to accept that others my be smarter than her and is willing to learn but refuses to be bullied intellectually.\n\nAnd the most important of all. nice hips that look quite child bearing.\n\nIs th<b> at sexi</b>sm?\nNO!! its called millions of years of evolution.

Amy experiments with monkeys and Bernadette makes drugs or helps to do so and her few commens on her job show how irresponsible about human health her and her fellow workers are in tha tfeild and we all know the bad things about drug companies while Pennies job is to sell the drugs to <b> doctors </b>and her job is reknowned for its imorality, atractives salesmen selling the most expensive prototype to<b>  doctors</b> or some drug with bad side efects or tha tais in some other wise otherwise dangerous.\n Penny is hte only one that is really distressed by the imorality of her job, drinking more when she thinks of it and often trying to cry out of it a thing that pig Leonard wont hear of. That makes her the most together of the three women I reckon. \nThat she is attrractive is the fault of the program. There are, in real life, a lot of attractive profesional women. indeed profesional women can spend more on clothes and on help so have more time to do themselves up than house wives do. In this programthough  the unproffesional one is the most graceful both physcal and as to social graces which are an product of intelligence. What is sexist is to look down on women unless they have a good job and often even when they do, and even more so the fact that they abuse her is sexist. \n    Sheldon and Leonard want ther around, even chase off competition so making it hard for her to escape them, while they continually say disparaging things to her so that she would be better off without them. She is a social advantage for them and also her company is pleasurable, she is an intelligent and witty and kind and soothing for them, a person, who they want to have around and who makes them more attractive to others but they want to have her without allowing her to feel she has any worth. They dont want to have to pay for it treating her well, sharing their glory of intelligent beings with her. \n    They dont only, not acknowledge her worth, acknowledging her worth would be to credit her, only sin by default, they actually knock her often, discredit her all the time and also knock any chance she has of being something that is more respected, has a higher social kudos value, would bring her up to their level, by doing all they can to make ther feel her desire to act is hopless, and so making it psychologiacally hard for her to go on instead of trying to help her get it off the ground and so to reach their level.\n   Optimally, as leonard pretends to love her,  he could as well as not discourageing her give her pratical. He could maybe help her to do less work in hte cheescake factory so giving her more time to work at acting. He could give her acting classes. His mother helped him to be a scientist, cold as she was she did not turn him into <b> a nobod</b>y. Acting is a career that is despised by some but which needs talented people, you need to be good to do it to adquire a lot of skills to do well at it, it is not easy to be a good actor. \n   They like to keep the relationship as unequal as possible, they hope to enjoy her and also to increase their value at her expense, by pretending she has none and so that they shine bright at her side. They are looking for a  Tintin and Capitan Haddock type relationship but instead of just letting it be that if tha tis how things turn out, they are trying to make such a relationship happen by design, by behaving like though a bit less so, the second mate in Allen who is doing his best to knock Capitan Haddock to his knees. It is part of the whole, \"we are bullies a<b> nd pi</b>gs\", bit that is what this series is all about. \n     This work exposes bullies <b> and p</b>igs by describing them, it is why it is so good.",

I mean i think they handled the scene with them talking about the number of partners penny has had very well. there was no slut shaming. Amy asks how penny herself would categorize herself out of curiosity. No one ever implied it was wrong to sleep with that many people. Amy and bernadatte have both expressed jealousy in that regard so clearly they don't think its wrong. I also don't think them having a stupid female character makes them sexist. Does every women on film have to be intelligent now? Stupid women exist so what. Stupid men exist. the boys have often asked penny for help on things they are stupid about too. The first example yeah i'll give you that one. but i feel like t<b> he sexi</b>sm in that one is so conspicuous in that scene that you are suppose to be laughing at <b> the sex</b>ism. Not with it. It's suppose to be wrong. And it's pointing that out very loudly. Now whether or not that makes penny a bad role model is a good discussion, but i don't think every character on tv needs to be a good role model. TV would become profoundly boring if that were true.",

If not; remain delusional, fine by me.\n\nA) that's a joke at Leonard's expense, not pennys, you imbecile. Just because you dont understand a concept as basic as that doesnt make it sexist. Sorry. The joke that clearly flew over your head was that Leonard isnt a good enough scientist to beat out the likes of sheldon, or kripke, so his<b>  woman</b> is there to support him. Seeing as her character is established as someone not of high intellect, she obviously cant support him in that regard, now can she? There is simpl<b> y nothin</b>g sexist about her expressing her sexuality.\n\nSecondly, that's not sexist in the slightest. It's becoming more and more apparent that you dont actually know wh<b> at sexi</b>sm means. Like I posted above, the concept<b>  of sex</b>ism is D I S C R I M I N A T I N G against someone solely due to t<b> heir ge</b>nder. That's not what was done in the clip at all. Firstly, the joke isnt a reference t<b> o her g</b>ender, it's a reference to her attractiveness. If penny was the scientist and Leonard the arm-candy, you wouldn't call that sexist. So fuck off with your idiotic double standards. The joke isnt prioritized <b> on her </b>gender, get that through that excuse you call a brain.\n\nThirdly, sheldon doesnt believe women are inferior to men. Nor does the show. The show has countless intelligent female presences. Just because penny isnt one isnt sexist. Amy, Bernadette, leslie winkle, that newitski girl who helped sheldon, Leonard's mother, etc. The list goes on. On top of which he CONSTANTLY references madam curie as a pioneer of science. In addition, let me remind you Zach was a character. A male, who's less intelligent than the rest of the cast (like penny), who's attractive (like penny), which serves as his form of comedic value (like penny). So if the show is \"sexist\" towards women because if how they occasionally portray Penny, then I guess its sexist against men too, right? No. Neither is true. Just because you're easily offended by the fact that Penny isnt a rocket scientist doesnt make it sexist. \n\nThis is getting long enough, so I'll wrap this explanation up with one final point. Penny, is portrayed by Kaley Cuoco. Kaley Cuoco in real life is a devout feminist and constantly fights for equality, as well as the extinc<b> tion of</b> sexism. Fortunately, shes clearly much smarter than you are. If this scene, or any scene on the show for that matter was sexist in anyway, she wouldn't do it. That'd be a basic contradiction to her beliefs. And shes a huge part of the show so she definitely has the option to refuse certain scenes.\n\nI'd say hopefully this knocked some sense into you but I think you're far past that. Chances are you wont even read this entire comment, simply due to the ignorance you've already shown. Sorry to break it to you, but you simply repeating \"nonono it IS sexist\" and offering no explanation as to why, doesnt make you right.",

To be so devoid of logic or reason that you have to resort to pointing out a few missed apostrophes that autocorrect didn't pick up, as if that's what's important in an argument. Not to mention your comments are riddled with grammatical errors, incorrect sentence structure, etc.\n\nStill didnt post anything if substance though. Not a single response to any of my many arguments debunking everything you've said. I'd find it cute if you were 10, but I'm guessing you are not.\n\nThat's alright. Continue on with the ad-hominem. People only resort to that shit when they know they've already lost the actual argument so I don't mind. By all means, keep embarrassing yourself by showing whatever reads this that you're too incompetent to have an adult discussion or back up a single thing you say. Not an issue for me. You do you.\n\nFrom here on, unless you post a comment actually addressing the many arguments I've made proving you wrong, I'm going to simply respond with the same comment. \"Pitiful attempt, try addressing the argument this time\", or something along those lines. \n\nNot going to waste anymore time on someone so stubbornly set in their ways they dont even bother to listen to the oppositions explanation. Keep acting like a child.\n\nCurious, hows it feel to lose not only the original argument, but the whole grammar dilemma as well to someone who has English as their 4th language?",
