She supported euthanasia and committed physician-assisted suicide on YouTube even though she had no terminal illness at all. There is one thing she did say that I agree with and that was that the radical feminist movement is a<b>  lesbian</b> movement,she was obviously very proud of that fact.",

The Bible gave us our morals amd values. The stripping of the Bibles teachings have degraded us as a people and as a country. Thats why we see the confusion of the  lgbtqaijbdldosbdbxjckcnvkksjs community!!!!! The lack of appropriate morals and values have turned this country into a pig pin of immoral sinners.

It is unfair to blame<b>  woman</b> for wanting to live freely rather than blame (the overwhelmingly male) perpetrators for hindering this. She claims women need to take responsibility and yet does not seem to recognize that it is the men who are ultimately responsible for their actions. As much as the right can't stomach it, the 1 in 5 statistic remains. Women have a right to be fearful and a right to ask for protection, damn anyone who calls women weak for asking not to be assaulted for living \"freely\"<b> . Woma</b>n should be afforded the same life experience as men yet the female experience limits women in their freedoms; so it's impossible to live freely as<b>  a wom</b>an.\n\nIn the words of Sylvia Plath \n 'Yes, my consuming desire is to mingle with road crews, sailors and soldiers, barroom regulars\u2014to be a part of a scene, anonymous, listening, recording\u2014all this is spoiled by the fact that I am a girl, a female always supposedly in danger of assault and battery. My consuming interest in men and their lives is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce them, or as an invitation to intimacy. Yes, God, I want to talk to everybody as deeply as I can. I want to be able to sleep in an open field, to travel west, to walk freely at night...'\n\n\n Ironically the dismantling<b>  of gen</b>der is required in order to truly \"free women\"",

I think these kinds of probes have become so habitual many interviewers are not aware that they are doing it, but they don't serve to increase the confidence of the viewer, so I think their time is up.  I generally find you a good interviewer, so see this as friendly constructive criticism.\n\n\nCamille Paglia, we need more of your clear-minded analysis.  I can't wait to read your book.  You are dead wrong about \"hate speech\" being only about expressing hate.  What is being codified against, in the main (so far), is actually incitement by means of hateful propaganda.  Perhaps consider that our real complaint, quite often, should be with the totalitarian thinking that sees all points on any continuum as morally equivalent, not with individual instances of it like \"hate speech\" (and all the other shibboleths of Grievance Studies departments).",

These are the same additives and belies that 60's feminism fought against it is also the the reasons women were not allowed to make contracts in the past ( women were not held legally responsible for their mistakes or actions so if they made a deal and then broke it the person they made a deal with had not way of enforcing the deal. at least not with the women so they would take a male relative to court over it. And because of this after a while people stopped making deals with women and only made them with their male relatives).\n\n\nModern feminism is regressive. Just like modern social justice. It is the social justice activice that are the ones calling for segregated spaces based on <b> race </b>(and<b>  gender</b>).",

After she screamed and kicked to get away from him, my daughter went to the legal aid on campus asking for assistance. They refused to help calling it a conflict of interest because he was educational staff . My 5'3\" daughter took it to the presidents office, more than once. The TA confessed that he had assaulted her. When the consequences for this man we're minimal, my daughter posted the incident on Facebook. After hearing from multiple other female students who had had the same experience with this man, my daughter invited them to go with her to the orange county police department. They said they did not want to go through what my daughter had been through. She pursued it alone, with great courage, straight through to the end. The emotional and physical consequences of that fight affected my daughter for three years. She is now brave and strong and whole.",

            "commentText": "This is a waste of time except how adept and brilliant Camille is at countering these attacks on her position by a clueless feminist journalist. The conversation between Jordan Peterson and Camille Paglia is far more fascinating. They discuss the history of how all of this idiocy going on today started. I am not familiar with exactly what Postmodernism is. However, I think I recognize to whom they are referring when they use the term, Neo-Marxist. I believe these are the same individuals whom I refer to as pseudo-Marxist. Jordan and Camille both discussed how much the Neo-Marxists despise the working class. This exactly coincides with the deliberate attack on working class men (the true Proletariat) by the feminists (the true Bourgeoisie). This is why I call them pseudo-Marxists. In the past most Marxists were at least perceptive enough to realize how necessary it was to enlist the aid of the Proletariat (especially working class men) to be successful in replacing the status quo. After the success of the revolution, then later on they would prosecute the Proletariat. But, the modern pseudo-Marxists aren't even intelligent enough to realize how foolish it is to deliberately alienate the true Proletariat especially when you are so obviously Bourgeoisie (professional women, making mega bucks, dressed to the nines, glittering in jewels, living in showroom houses with designer furniture). I would also call these people pseudo-Anarchists. They also consistently wrongly refer to themselves as Anarchists and yet they are constantly lobbying for MORE laws, MORE restrictions on basic civil liberties. It is obvious to me that they have no clue what being an anarchist truly means. If you look at many of us who now call ourselves MGTOW and see some of the statements being made I think you would agree that many of us are true anarchists, philosophically but not necessarily politically. These people (especially the women) are really sad, pathetic poseurs. They may talk the talk but they definitely do not walk the walk. One of the many examples of this contradiction would be a feminist who blames everything on the \"<b> Patriarchy\"</b> and demands that system be destroyed. But then less than fifteen minutes later she is actually DEFENDING the existence of the<b>  Patriarchy</b> when she makes the demand that \"all men should have the responsibility of protecting all women!\" She is apparently not aware that the system for which she wants complete destruction already supported her second idea. But, she is also not intelligent enough to keep her big mouth shut because some MGTOWs liked her first idea and despise her second one anyway for the very reason that her first idea would deliberately eliminate the idea that men have ANY responsibility to women at all including being required to protect all of them. What is Toxic Masculinity? Any idea or process or action embraced by any man which could conceivably result in a situation where it might be personally toxic to him, in other words detrimental in some way to his personal well being. For example the idea of believing that men should pay for women's dinners on a date is potentially toxic because it may threaten his financial stability.  Getting married is toxic because the marriage has a high probability of ending in divorce which could expose him to a very toxic environment dealing with cops and courts and government bureaucrats especially those who are feminists and have historically proven they are misandrist<b> . Misandr</b>y is EXTREMELY toxic to men and should be avoided at all costs.",

Haters like to talk about their hatred, so the motive is often revealed orally or in writing, either beforehand or during the commission of the crime, i.e. in hate speech.  The speech itself should not be illegal, but in the context of an actual crime might well be introduced in evidence as an aggravating factor (IMHO).",

            "commentText": "2:20 is exactly the point most people are overlooking.   Feminism has become way more than just equality of access for women.  Now feminist want to select specific domains to gain control, including having free college educations paid for by tax payers, including working class men, many who are single and will never attend college. In addition, many feminists want laws (such as in Hollywood), to force companies to have 50% females in upper management (regardless of ability/experience/work ethic), but only in white collar professions.   Women will NEVER control blue collar domains, ever.  If the government tried to force 50% female bosses in blue collar jobs, the whole infrastructure would collapse, as men would quit. It's easy to promote someone in a white collar job who isn't qualified as you can just assign a mentor to give them inside information, extra guidance, and cover for their mistakes. You can't do that in blue collar professions, your ability and results are clear and obvious and you will not get promoted unless you can handle the workload and are proficient at your job.  Many large companies that are ordered to hire  and promote more minorities/women will create artificial pseudo management positions in order to satisfy EEOC requirements under consent decree, even if those candidates aren't the most qualified. After a certain period, they will just lay many of those people off, rinse and repeat.",

The Suffragettes and subsequent Feminists, up to today, are primarily from the middle class.\n\nWe haven't reverted to the 1950s. Women were working in factories half a decade before the mythical and often demonized 1950s. The Honeymooners television show was based in the 1950s. We actually might see heartier women with actual honor systems if we go back to the 1950s.\n\nIsm is defined as a doctrine, theory, state of being, and one other that I'm blanking on. An ism is meant to either be devoted or adhered to. Given this, what is Feminism really? What doctrine, theory, or state of being of the feminine must anyone be devoted or subservient to?\n\nI think if we look at the term Feminism, after separating out the joined terms and viewing it holistically, we can see that the term means literally <b> nothing.</b> That makes it an empty suit of sorts for anyone to use and make things up as they go.",

Men never wanted women to compete with them, men understood women's biological boundaries thats why we have provided & protected women & children for so long. It's very disrespectful how women think about men now, everyday they want something changed to favour them and at the same time they are man bashing or shaming men. I can't think of many things that women do that is sustainable, women from generations before were amazing but now the modern western women is behaving like a spoilt child.

That's not asking questions that is forcefully shoving words into the guests mouth. Right off the bat first question, Camille- Stop bashing men to fit your new life style in the work place.\nReporter- So Women are too focused on their careers?\n\n\nCamille- Women need to take responsibility for their actions\nReporter- but should't women feel free from <b> sexual </b>assault?\n\n\n\nIt's hard to take the reporter seriously with questions like that...she really could have dug deep into Camille there and missed every single chance. If she had done any basic research that she clearly didn't do referencing the aging pop star. Instead she reinforced Camille's argument that Feminists are not about equality but about control.",

            "commentText": "I think the real problem is that women have moved ahead very quickly with the establishment of their own <b> sexual </b>identity and equanimity of standing in<b>  sexual</b> relationships but have failed to simultaneously develop their ability/willingness to take responsibility for their own actions in that regard.  Not to sound like a comic book here but - With great power comes great responsibility!  Women have eagerly taken up all the the reins of power but they continue to fail to act responsibly in the exercise of that power.  \n\n\nWhen push comes to shove, many women will continue to fall back on finger pointing to escape having to take responsibility for their actions when those actions lead to undesirable outcomes.  They know full well that when they point the finger at a man, society will rush in to destroy that man on their behalf.  This is because society continues to considers women to be \"powerless\" (even though they are not) and affords them a protected status in that regard.  As long a society continues to ignore the role of women in bringing about an undesirable outcome, we will have turmoil between the sexes.",

Seems spot on. Their parents would be the big daddy governments and NGO/women's organizations I suppose? I hope that truly is not the case in the west. Else you have a big problem on your hands, dealing with a whole bunch of grown up \"kids\" who do not have a sense of responsibility and only the privileged access to their rights. If that is the case, what has your society done to itself??? Dreadful .....",

Furthermore, characterizing the left in such a manner of 'always going for the throat' is simply a falsehood because many members operate behind closed doors and would do anything but make themselves vulnerable. I can tell you mean to understand ideas better and I hope this does not come across as abrasive. I simply think you are optimistically giving the interviewer and MSM too much credit.",

Interviewers have an ethical obligation to remain neutral and build rapport with their subjects, especially those interviewers, which are under the purview of a taxpayer funded corporation. They might choose to play devil's advocate, but doing so would be predicated upon an aggressive context, which would typically be established beforehand and is highly inappropriate for the CBC, though they flaunt this in favour of agenda-driven politics all too often. There was minimal prompting regarding the aforementioned content, and lots of steering the conversation, negative phrasing and directed qualification.\n\n\n\"It's not right, of course, for anyone to impose themselves sexually on another person\u2014naturally.\"\n\n\n...and yet Paglia is portrayed as controversial, the editing of the opening sequence of this video sensationalized, suggesting through visual/audio association her views are divisive, antagonizing and regressive.\n\n\nI'm all for asking hard questions, but when a public news organization shows their hand to be beholden to a preconceived discourse under the aegis of the ruling government (with a looming prospect of unprecedented government funding,) then the narrative becomes obscured and a true analysis is lost. If questions are to be asked, which they always should be, then they must be asked in completely detached manner, taking due care to suppress any individual or collective biases associated with the research.\n\n\nI'm not sure I agree with all of Paglia's ideas, but she is an intelligent, well spoken human being who commands respect for her old-school dialectic manner. We need more of that, but when the changing of the guard comes,  I can only hope there are new minds to fill the void left by the intellectuals of our time.",

It's new feminism today it doesn't seek out to give women the opportunity to compete on an equal Level Playing Field with the monopolists but only their male counterparts who are also subject to inequality as it relates to the corporatist monopolist system. And the words both men and women are prevented from competing with globalist corporatists monopolist system. Therefore they are not free. What determines your freedom is the ability to compete on an open Level Playing Field in the economy not just with men but corporatists system in such a way that they can accumulate the necessary resources which will be the very proxy by which they Define their lives on their terms. And from there the ability to create the necessary Security based on their economic output that which represents their output, the fruits of Labor, the store of energy which can be used at a later date to build their nesting grounds their nests and their security and safety. Lo and behold yes just like birds do in the natural Animal Kingdom LOL expressing their Universal rights to be. Yet you wouldn't even consider giving or granting your flock same Universal rights as the birds. And for this reason your human spirit will prevent you from elevation to new heights from which the human spirit can be nurtured and grow into a well-rounded and whole complete human spirit. It is economic freedom and some money which lends to developing sound mind, self-worth and the maturity as well as in turn from their the ability to Foster and nurture love, empathy and forgiveness Jared if we examine what is wrong with the world and what is missing we see these components of human spirit. This not only affects the so-called Human Resources But Central planners as well as they are also forced to amputate the human Spirit of what I call the six components of human spirit. Good ideas do not require violence. Economic freedom and sound money is a system that does not require heavy-handed approach in managing the so-called human resources, by championing facilitating the world through economic freedom and sound money you can create the closest resemblance to a utopian society. Continue on to the path of either State Monopoly or private sector Monopoly and as a result of the limited economic carrying capacity of this kind of economic model we will have to initiate various morally hazardous techniques to bring populations in line with The Limited carrying capacity have humans was in the system being used today and that has been used for quite a long time. The monopolization over the economy in the money supply is what we use as the two components to derive the misery index. We see some of the first formations of a monopoly 4000 years ago with the Sumerians. System of parasitism dating back 4000 years has prevented the human spirit at all levels, regardless of socioeconomic or anointed status or whether one is a street sweeper, everyone subject to the amputation of human spirit, thus no one is granted sanctuary.\n The Phoenix, Saturn the equinox, sanctuary.... yes the donkey is here, I am he",

If you offend against someone else you cannot blame any one else for your actions. That is equality. Demanding those social protections that  existed when you were seen as unequal and being equal are not compatible. This applies to all men and women.I believe that many of the dudes that want to be women is that they don't have to stand up to the responsibilities of adulthood, they want the protection of society.",

Truley two great minds. Free thinkers and classical liberals who the far left snowflakes wish to label as nazis and alt rightists and all the usual garbage but refuse to listen to absolutely some of the most important and thought provoking debate on record and actually does a great job of both diagnosing and even prescribing treatment of the current far lefts obsession w identity tribalism and that in summary the more we hyphenate oneself into groups. Ie person of color non cis genders dluid disables Muslim vegan etc that the inevitable horror they will find at the end is what the right and libertarians stand for and that is the absolute individual.   These infinite differences when taken to their full and total conclusion there can only be one true result and that is the stand alone individual and not at all part of a 'group' or tribe or identity etc.  we are already seeing infighting within these Intersectionists as to whose grievance and victimhood is ranked over the other and as if there is some sort of point system awarded by how many ways you 'perceive' to be oppressed in a time when the west especially has never ever been freer.   fascinating.  A must watch for all.   Worth every minute",

The interviewer is a fair stand-in for what a lot of people might feel about Paglia's stances, and her questions are a fairly close approximation of much popular opinion on this brand of against the grain feminism.",

She \"identifies\" herself as \"<b> transgender\"</b> yet she was born a female and is still a female, albeit a<b>  tomboy</b>.  She never got her breasts surgically removed nor has she undergone hormonal therapy.  Basically, she is what is called a \"butc<b> h lesbia</b>n\", which is n<b> ot transgend</b>er bu<b> t a wo</b>man who has masculine traits & mannerism and sexually prefers other women (usually with feminine traits, but not necessarily).  She, too, engages in the delusional identitarianism she rails against.  She's just a narcissist out for fame (or infamy) with her hand in your wallet.",

Digging a little deeper, they behave like hooligans towards the wife and the children then they want love in bed... lol...

So we pass the men's world and entered women's. Aggressive modern feminism is just the social norms catching up. There is no such thing as equality - its either the men's world or women's. As this bright women says - u have to be responsible  for your actions. For men it means - if u want to live in a civilized, comfortable world u will end up with matriarchy (cause its a women's value, their world). Whoever prefer an <b> old </b>good<b>  patriarchy</b> can go to the places like Afghanistan, or create \"Afghanistan\" in their own places. Until a bloody civil war starts in the West there will be a matriarchy growing everyday.",

Well if that is so, you are just proving my point. Women get ahead mainly because of their <b> sexual </b>power over men like you...who end up friend zoned :) Being a man does not mean you have to give to women what they want :) Actually many women admit they want a man capable of saying No to them.\n\nAnd yes, I do care about long lasting relationships, because<b>  promiscuous</b> way of living serves only young people and hurts children. And I wrote also tha<b> t promiscuou</b>s men are irresponsible as well. See, that is what I would like to come back - responsibility. Which is tough sale I know. Responsibility feels unpleasant, binding where freedom feels so nice and unbinding...\n\nI am not sure if women proved that they are capable that much. If companies forbid men being aggressive toward women (because she feels hurt) or fire people advocating for the case of men (James Damore or CERN scientist whose name I do not remember now, that wrote and supported by facts that women are not good in physics for example) convinces me that there is a double standard for men and women. Or what about the case that happened in Canada. Women became ministers just because they were women, not because they were the most capable.\n\nPeople have been given freedom of choice and look at the world now....pure chaos. We need to start asking difficult questions like how much freedom is too much of freedom or how much empathy is too much of empathy. Again - it is a hard sell to liberals like you, but too much of freedom and no responsibility leads to chaos with no rules Too much of responsibility and no freedom leads to pure order with no freedom. Freedom where we can prosper lies in between - chaos of nature and natural order, which one is.\n\nI am glad conservatives have started speaking up. It is quite interesting to see what liberals keep saying and what conservatives have started saying. It is my belief that the Truth can be revealed only if we look at it from at least two different perspectives. I hope Trump will be re-elected. I hope more conservative political leaders will be re-elected. I hope there will be new Sillicon Valley made by conservatively thinking people. \n\nIf feminism has been a social project lasting over 100 years it is perfectly understandable to look at the results of this project. Only a mad man keeps running a project that causes more harm than good. And if it has been advocacy for women's rights till now, the time has come to start standing up for men. If we wish to survive. Women have proven to be capable of same tyranny as men. Why should we let them keep doing it?",

Women have never wanted equality- they have always wanted power over men. Now they have it, they deny it. You have it, but you deny it. You're not equal nor can you ever be equal. You dominate- always get your way, and then claim victory for equality and that you women have 'come a long way' since the days when men used to be head of the household- oh, how dreadful for you poor downtrodden slaves. Imagine, a man as head of the household, breadwinner and maker of all important decisions. Imagine what would happen to society if men took back their place as leaders?

She will rule during first half of the final seven years of this<b>  age</b>. \n\nThis epic future peace treaty will probably be sparked by a war in which nukes are used. The whole world will be screaming out, 'someone, somebody, \u2014 do something!' Enter the peacemaker and the peace deal that initiates the final 7 years of thi<b> s ag</b>e.\n\nIn Revelation 17 John saw t<b> he harl</b>ot/po<b> rno wo</b>man riding the ten horned New World Order beast and bearing global rule. He was amazed and flabbergasted at what he saw.\n\nShe wanted dominion. Oh, how she lusted for that power! And God, being a God who let's history unfold for the sake of telling the eternal story before angels and men forever will let her have her way. Yes, she will have her chance to write her history the pages of HIS-story. And like Jezebel, she will get that dominion over the whole world that she so much desired. \n\n It does it end well for her?\n\nWell, . . . . not so much.\n\nRead on into Revelation chapter 17 and find out what is going to happen to her.\nSee\n [LINK] ",

She's saying that these upper class women are trying to MANIPULATE the system to redefine men and manhood in a way that makes them less competitive so that those women can place themselves on top. The women are trying to define BOTH what it is to be a <b> woman </b>AND what it means to be a man. With that kind of control, they can give themselves both protections AND advantages while also working to undermine and disadvantage men. \"Too focused on careers\" - No, perhaps not focused enough on their CAREERS. Too focused on manipulation and knocking the men down to get higher in the ranks rather than work and merit.",

Paglia thinks Madonna would be wise t<b> o ag</b>e with (conventional) grace, akin to some of the 50's divas that Madonna herself has been inspired by.",

No crash dieting for a role or squadrons of personal trainers. You won't see many of them go under the knife either, and if they do, it's done very subtly. It does give one pause. I mean, we ridicule middle aged men who try too hard to stay young (cars too fast for their reflexes to handle, dating girls young enough to be their daughters...). Perhaps rightly so. There is something appealing about the idea of aging gracefully. Part of it will involve letting go of your past and evolving. But isn't that a reasonable philosophy for achieving balanced happiness in the end?",

I really hope people on the fence here pick up Paglia's book because it takes a lot of words to be counter-culture nowadays against the establishment talking points CBC was playing here. Via the internet, America has exported it's ideology of free speech to individuals across the globe and that genie isn't going back into the bottle. Paglia demonstrates here how to handle being (as a man or <b> woman </b>or trans) in a tough world full of people you disagree with. If you want to call speakers being banned \"far-right\" or say they use \"hate speech\" then boy howdy! You are not ready for the present-day/near-future of internet arguments spilling over into popular culture. You ain't seen<b>  nothing</b> yet. Camille Paglia isn't an assualt on your sensibilities unless you're a delicate, shrinking flower. She's a life-line to sanity if you listen to her. Wendy Mesley played the role of clueless establishment figure full of faux-outrage quite well here, but that shtick is precisely what's going to be intellectually demolished in the next few years.

                    "commentText": "+ Mustbe No, it is not apt. This is a criticism OF that framework. You don't use the 'framework' of an ideology to criticise the framework of that ideology.\n\nThis is precisely the problem with ideologues.... they can't 'step out' of their ideological framework and look at it with any degree of objectivity. They lose the capacity to cognise the world other than through the lens of their ideology. Rather than recognising that their perspective.... is a PERSPECTIVE.... they start to experience their ideological constructs as axioms; as 'first principles' embedded in the fabric of reality itself. That's why someone like Wendy Mesley... and apparently yourself... find valid, straightforward criticism of feminist thinking so baffling.\n\nBoth you and Mesley are obviously struggling in your own ways to reinterpret a clearly articulated, uncomplicated and, to a lot of us, self-evident observation into something that fits with your feminist presuppositions. Whereas the rest of us whose minds are not captured by feminist ideology simply take Paglia's point as SHE meant it... and as she clearly and concisely articulated it. \n\nThere's no need to drag Foucault into it if you have the capacity to appreciate another person's point of view. But of course, for feminists.... the IS NO OTHER point of view. There is only the absolute truth of feminist ideology.... and then there is everyone who is wrong, misogynistic, part of the 'patriarchy', 'privileged'... and every other slogan, clich\u00e9 and trope that feminists reflexively default to whenever the flaws in their worldview are pointed out to them.",

First of all, Wendy Mesley is not the regular anchor of The National, Peter Mansbridge is and he does the majority of the shows (will be retiring soon), Wendy only fills in when Peter is on vacation or assignment such as the Olympics.\nAlso, it is not the Anchor who chooses the content, It is the CBC, The National is Canadas National news program and the majority of the content has to do with current news around the world. Occasionally they will do a piece such as this interview but it certainly is not \"a lot\".\n\nI watch the national at least 4 times a week so unless I am just missing all these hit pieces on men's rights that are broadcast during the 3 days I don't watch, feel free to post links to all these pieces you are referring too. I am not saying there isn't any, I am just saying there is no more on The National than any other Large News program.",

Women WILL receive equal pay for the job they do regardless of what men make, that is the goal and it WILL happen, so don't be surprised when it does. The #metoo movement is MASSIVE and women are gonna take back the government and Trump is gonna PAY for his crimes! That's the way JUSTICE works in the US, so if you don't like it, maybe you could pick up your marbles and try Russia. I think men are still in power there. You'd love Putin, Trump worships him which is why he sold our country out to the Russians.",

It's OUTRAGEOUS! He's just going to Pittsburg to make them feel even worse after one of Trump's followers massacred them because he BELIEVED TRUMP that some 'migrant terrorists' were at the border with Islamic terrorists which Trump had just told all of his fascist followers who in turn murdered Americans for Trump's FAscist agenda. And you're part of it Mary-ann with your hate against Americans. The Left wing, the Democrats and he Left are ALL AMERICANS too Mary-ann, and Trump is going DOWN, he's gonna be put in prison where he belongs!",

There can be no love if there is hate by the same token I hate needs to work itself out not by force force will only bring on more Force, to legislate anti-hate is to promote hate, after all your hate has to be punishable by potential execution if and when you fail to pay the fine for your hate.

She can enjoy her fluidity without insisting on having permenant body changes so she's clearly not at any of the far ends of the spectrum. Her saying \"<b> I'm lesb</b>ian\" is only meant to let people know that<b>  her se</b>xual preference is women quickly, rather than spend hours on expla<b> ining g</b>ender fluidity, which she does brilliantly in other talks. Her being biologically a women and into women translates<b>  into \"l</b>esbian\" so I think it is very smart not to overcomplicate things, when it is unnecessary like most democrats these days, and thus get lost in the details.",
