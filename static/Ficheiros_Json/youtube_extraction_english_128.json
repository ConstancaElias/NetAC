    "commentText": "This is a very accurate video. Older people are definitely pushed out of and not even considered for most jobs. Some of that is valid, as an older person you generally are not as up to the demands of a hard physical job. Also as an older person many of us are not as fast mentally as we used to be and can lose some memory ability. Having admitted older people have some downsides, it is my experience that most of the job bias is just pure predjudice. You only need to read the comments on this video to see how bad it is and how acceptable it is to demonize anyone who is in the 50 and older class. It is truly amazing to me how little the next generation understands the past and how much they seem to blame and hate their parents age group for things that are occuring now. Take today's young and put them where we were 35 years ago and very little would change but in those younger minds it's all about how selfish and stupid we boomers were and how we left nothing for them.  It will be truly interesting if as they age they grow out of this distorted view of their parents history. I suspect that they will as we the now aged boomers did  with our parents.",

I will never understand why ppl over there resist soo much being an old person. I mean what's the point in living without accepting facts. I may be young today but I'm pretty accepting of the fact that I will be old, as long as I do not die before I do. Yes we should sympathize with their issues but you can't sympathize and be understanding yet get told that you are being offensive. This is somewhat true with gender issues as well. \nThe facts are, old ppl are weaker and lack motor skills in general\nOld do not look the same as when they are young. Which is a superficial thing especially at that age.\nThe old really do need to prioritize the young. It's an evolutionary instinct for a reason.",

Younger people eventually bounced back but not your middle aged who are now old because lets face it almost no company ever hires older workers when they can get cheaper and younger ones. Now this older generation is crying because nobody would hire them. Solution is save your money during your working years and use that and SS to live on later",

Youths won't get social security even though we pay for it and you want to tax more to make it more luxurious? I'm making sacrifices while I'm young so that I'm not a burden on others. Maybe they should have to.

The issue is here is that rather than learn and adapt, Boomers are in it for themselves with the attitude of “i get mine, screw everyone else”.\n\nIf they tried to adapt with the times, we would notice and accept the effort. This is a uniquely narcissistic generation that refuses to change, and holds the younger american generations hostage. In this case, the decisions we are looking at were not 100 years ago, but merely 30 years ago or less.\n\nContext has changed, yet they have not. This is also the cause for the current resentment. They enriched themselves while bankrupting and leaving little for the generations below them.

One lady friend is in casting at Fox said that I have some 'neoteny,' or have kept some of the characteristics of youth a little longer than some folks, that i'm 'in the middle range' and that they're always looking for that trait because youth 'n good looks have been responsible for having sold about 90% of movie tickets since 1915, but that it's usually accompanied by a well maintained good attitude. \nI think of Peter Pan and Tinkerbelle almost every day because and keep a couple of their yt videos handy, even though i'm a big, straight guy. No apologies, I love to watch them fly, love them for what they 'are' and for teaching me about life when age 4-5.

I TWEETED Greta Thunberg, today, and thanked her for her CONCERN and ACTION , regarding CLIMATE CHANGE.  I told her to HOLD ON TO HOPE, and I asked her to please watch a song that I wrote and uploaded to UTUBE, entitled \"Now is the Time,\" which is about facing CLIMATE CHANGE with HOPE, not FEAR. I am not a good guitarist, nor a great singer, but, it was something  I wanted to do( in a small way) to SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE.\nThanks to all of you KIND and POSITIVE PEOPLE , who have responded to my post. God bless you, my sisters and brothers!",

You don't want the elderly person to tell you about things to know when you're old, you want them to tell you about things to know when you're still young. The wisdom you want is something you don't know, and the root of that is respect for the elderly, not an acknowledgement that you, some day, will be old as well. That puts you on the same level, and you don't want that, because you aren't on the same level. You want to acknowledge that you're young and have a lot to learn and out of respect for the experiences of those who came before you, you can learn.\n\n\nThis video is like most progressive ideas, noble goals with counter-intuitive means.",

It just so happens that anyone of retirement age or older, right now, were exposed to lead for the majority of their lives on a daily basis.  So their fukpotato to normal human ratio is artificially higher.\n\nWe should be ignoring the elderly lead poisoned generation and hoping those in power die sooner than later.

Respecting the elderly around you for their age allows you to hear them out. When, they then, speak jibberish and nothing of interest, you'll know. But speaking to them and respecting their word starts with an actual respect for their age, not an acknowledgement that you, too, some day, will be old and should listen to them to know what it will be like.

But real wages have gone way, way down.\nIt's not because women work, but because women and men work.  Two incomes creates more buying power, which causes higher prices in a competitive bidding market (i.e. real estate).  The home I was born in now lists for four times what my parents sold it for, that's an insane rate of inflation.  Single-earner families, which used to be the norm for the middle class, are now the purview of the elite (top earners) and the impoverished (regular and low earners).  To be middle class now requires two average wages.

A result of exactly 1.1 means population stability.  A result of less than 1.1 means population decline. \n\nThe result of Very Conservative American Women was 1.01, which reveals slow population decline that can be offset by limited, merit-based immigration.  Not surprisingly, this immigration policy is what Very Conservative American Women prefer. \n\nThe result for Very Liberal American Women was 0.6, which reveals massive population decline.  (I think the decline is so steep that it predicts extinction in three generations.)  Naturally, this means that Liberalism is, literally, a political dead end.  But Liberals use predatory policy practices to prevent themselves from admitting this, such as open borders immigration. \n\nLiterally every Liberal political policy, both foreign and domestic, is designed to minimize Liberals' relative inability to give birth and raise children.  It is the ultimate defining characteristic of every Liberal, and everything else is just a ruse.",
