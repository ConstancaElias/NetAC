        "postText": "A Muslim woman says she felt \u2018humiliated\u2019 and \u2018violated\u2019 after being refused entry into a nightclub for wearing a hijab.', 'Soaliha Iqbal was in the queue with friends outside a Sydney venue, when a member of door staff asked her to take her hijab off.', 'She wrote on blog post website 5Why: \u2018Chatting and laughing with my mates in the line, I broke off mid-conversation to hand my ID to Paragon\u2019s bouncer-but he didn\u2019t ask for it or take it.', '\u2018Instead, he pointed to my hijab and said \u201ctake it off\u201d.', 'The 21-year-old says she was in such shock at the request that she couldn\u2019t muster the words to respond and felt discriminated against.', 'Police who were in the area had to intervene as the argument between Ms Iqbal and the door staff became more heated, after the doorman was called racist.', 'Ms Iqbal was told to move 50 metres away from the venue, after staff cited a law requiring those who had been refused entry to a venue, to do so.', 'She said her treatment had amounted to blatant discrimination and that she had \u2018never been treated so badly in her whole life\u2019 and also felt that the police had blamed and gaslighted her.', 'Ms Iqbal also said that she has not had a problem with bouncers in the past letting her in with her hijab because \u2018they know she doesn\u2019t drink and wouldn\u2019t be causing any problems\u2019.', 'She added that she was angered by management staff\u2019s refusal to apologise to her, who at the time \u2018refused to acknowledge that it was wrong to ask me to take my hijab off\u2019.', 'In a later statement posted on Facebook, Craig Wesker, group operations manager for Ryan\u2019s Hotel Group who own Paragon, issued an \u2018unreserved apology\u2019 to Ms Iqbal.', 'He added: \u2018As this was [the bouncer\u2019s] first shift on the venue, he no doubt wanted to impress the venue management with his professionalism and attention to detail in carrying out his duties and responsibilities diligently.', '\u2018Due to this diligence when checking you (sic) ID and trying to ensure he had facial recognition, he asked you to remove you (sic) hijab interpreting it as only a head scarf.', '\u2018Understandably, you were taken aback by the request and then by virtue of the fact that there was quite a number of people trying to enter the venue, he asked you to step to one side so he could talk to you further about it.', '\u2018This action appears to have been interpreted you (incorrectly) as the Security Personal denying you entry for you refusing to remove your hijab.\u2019",

The more exclusive nightclubs I've been in wouldn't hesitate to deny entry to someone who wasn't dressed to their standards. It's part of maintaining a certain vibe. If she was wearing an <b> old,</b> stained t-shirt and cutoff shorts, she probably wouldn't be allowed in to an upscale nightclub. Being a private business, they can do that. People think they're entitled to anything they want and always cry discrimination when they don't get their way. Like a child.",

As it says in the article.The whole reason her non-drinking is cited is, as the whole sentence says: \"Ms Iqbal also said that she has not had a problem with bouncers in the past letting her in with her hijab because \u2018they know she doesn\u2019t drink and wouldn\u2019t be causing any problems\u2019.\" Reading the words reveals it wasn't her first time in the club, and she had always been admitted with her hijab on.\"More exclusive nightclubs\" tend to attract and admit the kind of person who can at least f*cking read, so I doubt you've been inside any at all.",
