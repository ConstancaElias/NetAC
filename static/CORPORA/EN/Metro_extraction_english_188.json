        "postText": "Members of the Royal Family are expected to face heavy scrutiny.', 'That\u2019s part and parcel of joining the clan. The media will dissect and analyse your every outfit choice, hand gesture, facial expression.', 'Royalists in this country are fervent and tenacious \u2013 step out of line and they will jump on you. We\u2019ve seen it over the years with Diana and Fergie \u2013 unsurprisingly, it is the women who usually take the brunt of the criticism.', 'But the vitriol directed at Meghan Markle is disproportionate and unsettling.', 'The mental gymnastics some are performing to find excuses to spew hatred in her direction are astounding.', 'So what do some people on Twitter really mean when they say they find her \u2018repellent\u2019? Is it really because she\u2019s wearing the wrong nail varnish or the wrong shape of dress?', 'Or is it because they can\u2019t stand the idea of a non-white member of the Royal Family?', 'If you don\u2019t like Meghan because she\u2019s mixed-race, just say it with your whole chest', 'Earlier this week Meghan walked out on stage as a surprise guest at the Fashion Awards. She was wearing a sleek, one-shouldered black dress, matching dark nail varnish, and cradling her neat little baby bump.', 'The outrage online began almost immediately.', '\u2018She is just constantly showing off and this is really disgusting and repelling,\u2019 Tweeted one furious viewer.', '\u2018Cupping the bump? WHO DOES THIS? #MeghanMarkle who the hell does she think she is Madonna and child? Something VERY creepy going on in this woman\u2019s head,\u2019 raged another.', 'They didn\u2019t like her cradling her bump. They didn\u2019t like the outfit. They didn\u2019t like the nail varnish.', 'Criticism and scrutiny are, as I said, part of the royal package \u2013 but the volume and sheer levels of anger inspired by Meghan smacks of something else.', 'When some people on Twitter jumped to the Duchess\u2019 defense by posting pictures of Kate and even the Queen wearing one-shoulder dresses, another critic wrote, \u2018[but] Kate and Queen are elegant!!\u2019', 'It doesn\u2019t take much work to unpack that logic. Kate is seen as \u2018elegant\u2019, where Meghan, in a similar outfit, is \u2018disgusting\u2019.', 'You can\u2019t ignore the element of British snobbery here. For some people, their distaste for Meghan centres on the fact that she is not blue-blood. She\u2019s just too American, too \u2018flashy\u2019 to ever be considered true royalty \u2013 according to age-old British tradition.', 'But for some of her critics, the comments lean towards barely-veiled racism. It is the insidiousness that really gets to me.', 'No one will say what they really mean \u2013 instead, they find any and every excuse to tear Meghan down, but stealthily creep around any overt references to race.', 'By attacking her outfits, make-up, hair and behaviour, rather than the colour of her skin, her critics give themselves a snuggly cloak of deniability.', 'I don\u2019t hate her because she\u2019s half black, they will tell themselves. No, it\u2019s the nail varnish. It\u2019s definitely the nail varnish. Vile.', 'This sneaky, subtle, under-the-radar racism is typically British \u2013 and really difficult to fight.', 'If you call it out, it\u2019s all too easy to be accused of \u2018playing the race card\u2019 or having a \u2018chip on your shoulder\u2019. This is the kind of rhetoric that Meghan\u2019s critics want. It\u2019s a paralysing argument which derails the conversation entirely and shuts down your claims.', 'These kinds of views, by keyboard warriors, furiously typing in their dingy bedrooms, red-faced with a vein throbbing at their temple, are overtly hostile.', 'But even \u2018experts\u2019 with less extreme, but still dubiously critical, views of Meghan are being given mainstream platforms. It is the use of coded language by reputable sources that I find particularly damaging.', 'The standards for Meghan are immeasurably higher than they would ever be for Kate. Her ethnicity means that she has to prove herself 10 times over.', 'It\u2019s unlikely that she will ever be enough or do enough to please the masses. And that\u2019s because the thing about Meghan that many take issue with, is something that is impossible for her to change.', 'Maybe there\u2019s an element of unconsciousness about it. Maybe some of these people themselves don\u2019t even realise what\u2019s at the heart of their inexplicable hatred of Meghan.', 'But to those people I would say that it\u2019s time for a serious session of introspection.', 'In big 2018 it\u2019s not really good enough to just unthinkingly accept your inherent biases \u2013 there is something you can do about it.', 'Rigorously dissecting your own opinions and making a conscious effort to notice and unlearn unconscious behaviour, is something we should all be doing. Why do we think the way we do? What\u2019s at the root of our opinions?', 'If Meghan\u2019s nail varnish or dress choice makes your blood boil, take a moment to understand that thought and what could be behind it.",
