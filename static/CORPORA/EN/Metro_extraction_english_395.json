        "postText": "The son of Brazil\u2019s controversial president Jair Bolsonaro has faced criticism for sharing a fake photo of teenage activist Greta Thunberg eating lunch in front of poor-looking children.', 'Eduardo Bolsonaro, who is bidding to become the Brazilian Ambassador to the United States, shared the image on Twitter.', 'In a speech at the UN on Monday, Thunberg, 16, who has inspired millions to protest against climate change, accused world leaders of \u2018stealing her childhood\u2019.', 'The Swedish teenager has, however, repeatedly faced criticism from right wing politicians and commentators as well as abuse from trolls on social media.', 'Thunberg was originally pictured eating food on a train with forest in the background and the caption \u2018lunch in Denmark\u2019.', 'But Bolsonaro, a federal deputy in Sao Paulo, shared a post which featured an edited version of the photo showing hungry-looking children looking through the window as Thunberg eats her food.', 'The president\u2019s son wrote: \u2018You stole my childhood said the girl financed by George Soros\u2019 Open Society.\u2019', 'The post featured an article suggesting Thunberg receives funding from George Soros, but reports state there is nothing to suggest she is funded by the Hungarian-American billionaire.', 'Many right-wing conspiracy theorists are convinced Soros is the secret leader of some all-powerful group of liberals which have a massive influence on global affairs.', 'Brazilian Senator Eliziane Gama, who forms part of the Foreign Relations commission which will decide whether to asses Bolsonaro\u2019s application to be the new ambassador to the United States, described the post as \u2018great irresponsibility\u2019.', 'She added: \u2018Fake news today is an evil which must be combated in every democratic society in the world.', '\u2018It\u2019s something that we do not accept, and it is accepted even less when it is done by a public representative.', '\u2018It\u2019s lamentable, and I think the deputy needs to retract it, make an apology to the 16-year-old and to both the Brazilian and international society.\u2019', 'Another post on Twitter which drew thousands of responses slammed Thunberg over the same photo for having \u2018processed food\u2019, but was later deleted following a backlash.', 'This week Prince Harry praised the Scandinavian campaigner and backed her concerns about climate change.', 'Prince Harry said: \u2018This last week, led by Greta, the world\u2019s children are striking.', '\u2018There is an emergency. It\u2019s a race against time and one in which we are losing, and everyone knows it.', '\u2018I don\u2019t believe there is anybody in this world that can deny science, undeniable science and facts.\u2019",

The difference is I don't bang on about how everyone should change their behaviour whilst I go on as before.  There's a lot of hypocracy.Take Sir David Attenborough for example.  I wonder how many air miles he's got under his belt making his nature programs all over the world.  Then he lectures about CO2 production and climate change.",

I agree with climate change and I don't share the hate of this kid but this meme is showing the irony of how a child of affluent parents who believes she is the voice of every child when she is from a privelaged background. There are children across the world who are malnourished and climate change isn't on their mind. She's lucky to be able to fear for our world when there are kids out there who's only fear right now is surviving another day while she is living a jet set lifestyle telling everyone else how the world is. This isn't a joke, this is reality. I'd you missed the point you need to look around yourself. The world really is suffering and so are many children too.",
