        "postText": " Bringing reflections and the reality of race relations in USA, Jim White Sr. provides a lens that goes back 53 years from his first experience with discrimination, coupling it with how he's struggling to provide counsel to his grandsons facing the same bias. This talk was the first time he's shared this provocative and heartbreaking story in public after his decision to be silent no more.. . James A. White Sr. is a Master Training Management Consultant and Executive Coach. As owner and operator of Performance Consulting Services, a business performance training, development, consulting and coaching firm in Columbus, Ohio, James is dedicated to sharing his experiences, insight, enthusiasm and passion with all people.. . With over 25 years of corporate, K-12/College education, and government experience, James is committed to the training and development of individuals, groups and organizations. He has conducted training consulting in over 34 school districts throughout the United States of America. In addition to his formal degreed education from MATA Drafting College, Capital University and The Ohio State University, James has acquired over 30 corporate certifications in performance training programs/initiatives. He has also accumulated tens of thousands of hours of platform delivery experience in the classroom environment. To date, James has successfully trained over 250,000 thousand people.. . As a result of his education, entrepreneurship and employment history with the Xerox Corporation, Wang Laboratories, Digital Equipment Corporation and the United States Air Force, James has a rich array of diverse business experiences, which positions him with a wealth of unique and valuable resources, skills and success tools. He is known for his humorous, yet real world and impactful, informative training style.. . James has recently co-authored a book on the topic of diversity, culture, consciousness, inclusion and integrity entitled: A Better World: Understanding How Your Personal Operating System Affects Culture, Diversity & Inclusion.. . Jim's philosophy is; once you put your mind to it (with the appropriate tools, skills and resources), you can overcome any of life's many obstacles and challenges\u2026 As a 17- year-old inner city, high school dropout with the disability of Dyslexia, he entered the U.S. Air Force, received his G.E.D and served his Country as an Air Policeman and Top Security Draftsman.. . James is devoted and extensively involved with his family, student education and community health and stability. In his commitment to the growth, development and advancement of all people, Jim has inspired people of all races, genders and backgrounds to take the steps necessary to achieve their goals and objectives. He truly believes we all are our brother and sister's keeper. The success of America lies in the hands of each individual U.S.A. citizen. Success will only be achieved through access, opportunity, equity and collective and shared responsibility. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Each individual must develop their skills, talents, strengths and passion in the achievement of performance excellence.. . In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations) ",

                    "commentText": "@sinjin4563 LOL. Yeah right. Institutionalized <b> racism </b>doesn't exist at least not anymore it did years back yes. And a few individual cases of unjustified actions won't change that because things like that happen in all races. Blacks are designed to fail? Not even close with affirmative action and people have status quos they have to meet,<b>  black</b> people are more likely to get jobs or raises that these particular white people are just as if not more qualified. FFS look at the oscars and the outrage about that. I mea<b> n blac</b>k people make up 12% of the population yet are supposed to make up like 50% of the nominees. Its bull shit. And its not based <b> on ra</b>ce. Its based on talent and performances. And that particular year the actors nominated happened to do better jobs. Is it because they're white? Fuck no.Psychologically blacks are seen as inferior? Um...lol no..Who teaches you that? Because th<b> ats rac</b>ist as hell. Say that shit to any place schools, businesses hell even people on the street they will say thats bull shit. Just like rape culture. Stop trying to be the victim so hard. Look at the conditions of<b>  the b</b>lack community? Okay I will. You don't think this has anything to do with the fact that rap and sub culture promotes prositution, gang violence and guns? Or that women get pregnant at such a <b> youn</b>g age sometimes before getting a college degree. Or that <b> 74% of</b> black children are raised without a father. No of course not right? Just blame the white man and cling to the democrats that only look at you as their vote and not peopl<b> e. If </b>a blac<b> k man </b>or woman has the will to do something they can sure as hell do it. Barack Obama, Ben Carson, Sheriff David Clarke. It was the actions of these people and the good decisions that got them where they are. Just as it i<b> s for </b>the black community. The white man is not holding you down. And if they are its those fucking democrats. In fact, I'll give you that. Welfare, Ebt cards and shit like that that the democrats give out instead of making these people work is h<b> olding</b> the black community down as a whole. But they should also take responsibility for that as well. Victimization? Actually according to numbers white people. white men more specifically are very victimized. We are 27x more likely to be attacked by Blacks. We are shot more by the police(which I fully support the police Blue lives matter). We <b> are see</b>n as racist just for having an opinion.  But I don't blame society for any of these things nor do I whine. I'm an irish guy, do I complain about how Irish people were enslaved and treated arguabl<b> y wors</b>e than black slaves no...Do I complain that the Irish were discriminated against back in the day. No...I know the history but none of these things are happening today.",

Also I bet you Martin Luther King Jr would be in support of Trump today his niece is and I'm sure he wouldn't approve of the way Hillary treats them like votes and not people. And also no the reason why so many mass shootings today happen is because of the increased gun laws. Look at any mass shooting its at a place where there are no guns allowed. Do you think gun laws will stop any criminal from getting guns? Look at Chicago with the highest gun laws and the most gun crime in the states. Gun laws really helped there right? Again no. The founding fathers were aware of automatic weapons and didn't care, they wanted to give the people power in case of a tyrannical government. How do you become a tyrant? Disarm the civilians. Look at hitler. Theres a quote for people like you and its \"those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\" Maybe you should look into that.",

Thats irrelevant are you saying that the majority of fathers that leave their families behind isn't because they don't want to be a father or they're being locked up by the police. Because I assure you the majority is that they don't want that responsibility. 99% huh? Actually its 84%. These are fbi stats btw. And yes it is still a high number, however look at the amount of deaths and you see there are a lot more <b> black </b>people being killed by<b>  black</b> people. Even if less crimes are reported which sucks I guarantee you the number would still not equal I mean 27x ffs. Also, rap culture and who writes these songs and does the music videos is up to them. Pretty much any random rap video will most likely have them waving guns around , smoking weed, have dancing half naked women, and gangs. BTW thats funny how you brought up being funded by Jews. Ever heard of George Soros? Yeah that corrupt piece of shit who's controlling clinton? He's also fundin<b> g blac</b>k lives matter.",

Maybe moving to a better state for your religion or<b>  ethnicity</b> would be better.  You should talk to them and let them know \"WE DON'T HAVE TO STRUGGLE LIKE THIS! There is a world of countries that offer a better life for us.\"  It's not hard to just do it, sell everything, Get Out!, Live Free, & FINALLY  BE  HAPPY.  If they refuse to be free, K-12 homeschooling will make things a little bit easier.  Sorry your suffering kid. Being peaceful, hanging with a good group of friends, telling guidance counselor, martial arts, & Prayer helps too.  Good luck to you.",

I mean,\u00a0a good solid majority of ,\"white\" families weren't even in America in the 1860's. Blaming isn't the answer\u00a0It is\u00a0 part of the problem. In fact, very few Whites ever\u00a0owned slaves. To completely look at the issue, how big was the Afro-Muslim slave trade vs the Small Atlantic Slave trade? The\u00a0Muslim trading of <b> African </b>Slaves dwarfs\u00a0what went on in the Atlantic, why don't we hear about that?\u00a0How are Blacks faring in those countries? How about the Kings of<b>  African</b> Nations\u00a0who, ordered fellow Africans rounded up and sold all over the world into Slavery and\u00a0who\u00a0profited\u00a0from the institution of slavery; How are those descendants doing today? I think past\u00a0events that took place all over the world surrounding slavery were/are despicable and were experienced by a majorities of people all over the world. All Peoples have experienced\u00a0harshness in one form or Another. It is a fact, White slaves fought in the Roman Coliseum to the death!\u00a0Hanibal took Europeans as slaves, I think he was Nort<b> h Africa</b>n.\u00a0My point is\u00a0laying the entire weight of this Giant\u00a0institution\u00a0at the foot of White Americans is short sited. The narrative of resentment and hatred taught <b> to bla</b>ck children is really coming home to roost now. Every day we <b> see Bl</b>ack on white violence way out of proportion to population. Why? In order to over come this and bring all people together its going to take a lot more than some sad personal anecdotes. Sadly, people are so bent on their own narrative that, no other objective facts can be considered. The guy who did this talk seems genuine but any good or progress he might make is erased by the next \"racial\" hoax blurted out on national TV airwaves. Any good he may do is totally wiped out crime by crime, victim by victim of y<b> oung b</b>lack\u00a0perps who feel as if this was just a small way of ,\"putting things right\". I digress, I don't know what the answer is but I can tell yo<b> u our n</b>ation as a whole has gone backw<b> ard i</b>n race relations\u00a0over the last decade. This tells<b>  me, if </b>nothing e<b> lse,</b> the old ways of blame and shame\u00a0is not working for anybody. In this case, lets hear a talk of experiences when a person di<b> dn't fe</b>el racism and was treated as an equal. Lets hear some stories where maybe they showed a little prejudice and what they learned from it, Lets hear stories where a White person was<b>  kind </b>to a Black person and vice versa,\u00a0surely there has to be a few of those stories in a lifetime. Or maybe we try to\u00a0just stop looking at humanity through a prism of color.",

That means don't celebrate their holidays don't spend Money on the Sabbath day and don't get into relationships with them (marriage.  Don't vote because it is not the solution.  We proved this to be successful Because we now don't have to ride on the back of the bus or give up or seat on the bus to a white person.  That resulted in the Montgomery bus boycott.  I t caused white America to rethink Their behavior due to the fact it caused them to have to park their buses and the drivers of those buses could not earn a living.  By not celebrating white people's holidays, the money we save can go into re building our community and letting them have their own and we can bring ourselves up to a much higher level because it will take a long time before money leaves our community.  We control 1.6 trillion dollars every year.  I say separate from people who have made it abundantly clear that they hate us and stop trying to love them who do not love us.",

Ha Also said\"when at all possible, be at peace with all men but don't let one try to punk you down.  I go to work and do my Job and do it to the highest standards.  I try to get more work done than others because the more I work the faster the time goes by.Yes you did so horrible things to my people because you know deep down inside when you responded and you expect us to not obey the Most High when he command us to remember so when you experience the retribution  no hard feelings.

The reason For this was that we fell under the curse of Deuteronomy 28:15,68 Because we did not keep the commandments.  Since 1969 the groups began to awake  to discover Who they were, What has been going on, Why have we been treatd like this and why do we keep forgiving people for the evil things they do to us.  Fact, one bullet from a gun will stop someone.

The problem is we give 839 Billion to the wrong person. Fact is we are not required to celebrate your holidays and we do have our own that are quite economical and would only cost a fraction of what is being paid now.  Further by observing the Sabbath, we also avoid needless spending in the clubs bars and eating establishments as well as Theaters.  Looks like if we obeyed that law, not only would you be able to complain about us being a threat to you due to the fact we ain't around you.  By not spending money on the Sabbath, Your profits drop.  Add that to the 863 billion the latino community controls and they are doing just fine, we can bring you down financially.  We have proved that with the<b>  Black</b> Wall street that got So called white people so vexed they Bombed the community and loot our people of all they owned.  And we were supposed to have the same rights as whites but was not protected.  Soon that will be visited upon you as well.  Sa stated August 20, 2019, we will no longer be under the so called white man and will seek a very special kind of revenge.  To all white people I would suggest that you get out there and live it up because once this goes down, you priviledge as you know it is over.",

Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.\n2 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised.\n3 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?\n4 Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.\n5 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?\n6 How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up!\n7 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.\n8 Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?\n9 And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.\n10 For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.\n11 In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.\n12 But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.\n13 Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;\n14 Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.\n15 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.\n16 For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.\n17 But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.\n18 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it.\n19 And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.\n20 And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south.\n21 And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD'S.

I had a mother and father both grandparents and I know I am not the only <b> black </b>family like that. I managed a restaurant had five white waitress all had no husband and was raising kids.There was a document about a family in Va name White they were on welfare did drugs and had babies no hubby.

So I dont expect anything from you, but first I dont expect you to except your own continuous doing and policies in the problems of <b> black-</b>people in Amerika. First you say were are the<b>  black</b>-fathers and on the other hand you mass incarcerate them for no good reason. Laws are created to lock one group up longer because of the typical drugs they use ( crack you get 10-20 yrs and Cocaine 1-5 yrs) All your policies an<b> d racis</b>t laws are directed to keep them down and you wonder why becoming a criminal is easier for good people and you wonder why it's easier to kill each other. But you dont care, that's the beginning and the end of the story. Blaming and coming up up with bogus statistics is what you do. But what is the context of the statistics, what can you learn about policies you approve <b> if bla</b>ck people do so bad, so long in a country that they help build.If you're a intelligent person you must see that there is a unnatural patron...things dont add up. But blaming and continue to support <b> the rac</b>ist laws that created this mess in the first place that is the doing of white people. This is the problem in housing, education, employment. The only thing what you need to do is to wake up and see what's really going on.",

In combination with a weaker , smaller group that creates deep and wide problems That is just 1 example. So imagine you get a felony easier than a white person the rest is 1+1 No housing,No welfare,No Job,No School, so life of crime is the only option and it all started with a bias towards a group and targeting of a group, that's not an accident that's a conspiracy to dislocate a group. I'm not saying they have no responsibility, they do and they should know better !.

Now with that definition, let's examine your comment. James White is expressing his experiences with <b> racism </b>through this Ted Talk. He is a<b>  black</b> man. He knows what it is like to be <b> a blac</b>k man in America and the repercussions that can come from simply having a different skin tone. I.e his examples throughout his talk. By you saying, \"you need to teach your grandkids this\" and \"don't confuse them that this <b> is raci</b>sm\" you are 100% trying to invalidate HIS experiences that you clearly have never had in your life. Also known as privilege. Who are you to decide whether or not his experiences, or those of ot<b> her bl</b>ack women and men for that matter, reflect a pattern of soci<b> etal ra</b>cism. YOU obviously disr<b> egard r</b>acism because you do not experience it. By stating that those men who were killed were thugs and we're in the wrong place at the wrong time is utterly ignorant. Tamir Rice was a 1<b> 2 ye</b>ar old boy who was a park with his little fake pellet gun (like a lot of boys of any color are) and he was murdered by police. A <b> 12 y</b<b> >ear o</b>ld black boy murdered by an adult white cop. There is no excuse for this. Now take for example the man who killed approx 14 innocent people in Colorado at a movie theater. He was taken ALIVE despite the police knowing there were casualties and he was a threat. This white man who killed people in a movie theater got a trial... Is imprisoned now. What about Tamir Rice's trial? What about Mike Brown's trial? Nowhere because they were murdered and rights to trial and lawful detainment taken away from them. Suddam Hussein was taken alive for Christ sake !! He was given a trial. So before you sit here and<b>  say th</b>at racism is long gone and things have chang<b> ed for</b> the black man take another look around you. This is the 21st <b> century</b> and racism is not dead.",

Now, as far as the recent shootings deaths you have mentioned, I have two different views, so I do not feel the one case belongs in this conversation, that case being Tamir's. As far as Mike Brown, I stand as I have already commented, learn to comply when approached by Law Officials. The movie theater shooter DID comply, that is why he was NOT shot and killed. He stopped and gave up, did not try to run off. Tamir was killed by an over eager,<b>  racist</b> , trigger happy police officer as far as I am concerned. The child was not given a chance in hell. Yes, the child was wrong for pointing the gun at people in the park, but the officer drove up on top of this boy and shot him within two seconds of approach according to video and reports.",

Just because you've had a hard life or have experienced prejudices doesn't mean you are exempt from perpetuating white supremacy in our culture. I'm a white female and understand I receive privileges socio-economically because I am white. To disregard the disadvantages <b> black </b>men and women face societally and economically is a travesty. Look up any govt stats and you'll see major differences between whites and minorities with incarceration rates,income,schooling. This is<b>  racism</b>. In regards to Mike Brown, he was unarmed. Even if he had ran away from police, this is not worthy of receiving multiple bullet holes in the body-causing death.The epidemic here is how police handl<b> e blac</b>k \"suspects\" and white \"suspects\" especially when racial profiling is a HUGE part of the police force. The thing that irks me when you are stating the importance of compliance is you're disregarding countless cases where compliance f<b> or bla</b>ck men and women were ignored and ultimately resulted in deaths. Eric Garner's death is a prime example of this. You can watch his death video on YouTube. I think it's unfortunate that you are giving an end all be all statement like \" comply with the police or it's your fault\" when there are so many cases and factors that prove what you're are saying isn't the most accurate. Concluding thought, why wo<b> uld bl</b>ack men and women feel they must comply with a culture tha<b> t is ra</b>cist towards them and has oppressed them from the beginning of their existence ? I wouldn't blame them for not wanting to.",

As long you plan to comment to the video, at least let it be known that the issue exists and needs to be dealt with and the little contribution you can do to help, like in the many youtube videos I've seen where people step in when they see these tragedies.\nIt really does not help the humanity to simply ignore it and except it when it is definitely not right, when you have equal rights to be on the face of this planet just as any othe<b> r rac</b>e. Don't downplay other people's struggles simply because they are not your chosen struggle.

By constantly whining about our own personal woes, we dismiss the fact that there are others out there with problems just as HUGE as our own. People get tired of hearing about how you hurt and I hurt and , what YOU can do for ME! People are people! There is always going to be something about you, or I that someone is not going to dislike and want to change about us. Even God tells us to \"turn the other cheek\" .\n\nIf you want to do something to help then go and do it. Don't make speeches , protest, get up on your soapbox and act like your some spokesperson for \"Your People\" . Do something. \"Your People\" are killing each other! What are you doing to stop it? Right now you are making the problem worse because you are making them believe they are less than who they are. Your speeches are keeping them down, not bringing them up! Let the past go and move ahead Princess! You obviously did it. Are you saying the rest of \"Your People\" just are not capable?\u00a0\n\nI don't speak for all \"white\" people because I don't feel responsible for them simply because I share their skin color. I realize there are some people out there that are just bad in nature and they have to answer for themselves. I don't try to find another <b> race </b>to blame their actions on. I also don't have control over the way other people treat me.

I may be in the wrong for saying this but I feel that your comment is somewhat insensitive in that it takes death too lightly. These young men are being murdered and this has been happening throughout history and unfortunately, even though it seems as if things are better now than ever, these things are still happening. You, yourself, acknowledged this in the following quote: \n\n\"Yes, the child was wrong for pointing the gun at people in the park, but the officer drove up on top of this boy and shot him within two seconds of approach according to video and reports.\"\n\nAlso, if the child had been white and had been shot for doing this, do you believe that the public outrage would have been the same?",

In this particular discussion I was never referring to the case of the 12 year <b> old </b>young child in the park. I was appalled by that incident and in no way felt that LE was in the right for shooting and killing this young boy.  We were discussing \"compliance\" with authority. \n\nWhen an officer pulls you over to the side of the road, or stops you on the street to ask you questions, it is your place as a citizen to comply. You have the right to ask for ID for your own safety and to be treated with respect to your person, but you also need to treat that man with the badge with respect. \n\nHe has authority OVER YOU, like it or not. It is his job. If you did<b>  nothing</b> wrong you will have your chance to prove that. You can even fight a simple speeding ticket. Why give the officer, who is carrying a deadly weapon a hard time, unless you're a total, brainless idiot?\n\nThat was what I was trying to convey in my comments. The police are and should be here to protect us. If you feel you are being stopped for the wrong reason, show respect for the badge and the authority it carries and plead your case before a judge. No one gets hurt, no one dies, and we don't have all of these butt hurt people feeling they need to protest and shoot officers that have families and are just doing their jobs.",

            "commentText": "Mr. White, Please hear me out, I am not a <b> racist,</b> and I'm sure you are not either. But as you explained their are too many of us\u00a0that are. However, contrary to your responsible attitude and way of life, their are too many crime ridden areas in our country that are mostly<b>  black</b>. Can you explain that?..... Is it lack of opportunity? Lack of education?\u00a0Lack of parental responsibility? ........ Are they just victims of their environment?........ I think not on all counts. I believe tha<b> t racis</b>m is embodied in the chip on<b>  a bla</b>ck persons shoulder and grows heavier each time they are rejected in favor of a white. I truly wish it was\u00a0not like th<b> is. Bl</b>ack crime in\u00a0this free country we call\u00a0\"America The Land of Opportunity\" is the opportunity most reje<b> cted b</b>lack males choose. It is the easy way out. I am 64 <b> year</b>s old and remember\u00a0MLK\u00a0Jr. and Kennedy and RFK and Malcolm\u00a0X and all the really inspirational leaders that simply would not stand for this. We now have trash like Al Sharpton stirring up the pot. Believe me I know a leader when I see one and you are the real deal..... It's too bad that\u00a0the police don't see\u00a0Blacks as human beings. I live in Louisville and we<b>  had a</b> black police chief for a long<b>  while. </b>Nothing <b> change</b>d. Black crime continued and op<b> portun</b>ist Black so-called \"leaders\" tried to change\u00a0our city. I guess what I'm trying to say is, t<b> each\u00a0y</b>oung black people they are American<b> s firs</b>t and black second. They are not slaves, they are not helpless, they\u00a0should not rely\u00a0on the government to support them after they have 4 or\u00a05 children out of wedlock. Teach them to respect themselves and they may choose to follow your path. The military saved your life! and I think you know that. It is clearly evident in your speaking. Thanks for the talk. I would love to hear back from you.",
