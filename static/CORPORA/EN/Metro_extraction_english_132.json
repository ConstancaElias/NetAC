This isn't to say that the same doesn't happen within other types of pride events, however a small percentage of millions of people can create a volumous crowd compared to a handful out of a thousand or so.There are extremists on all sides and those who shout the loudest are often the ones who appeal to a particular media narrative. There are for instance some<b>  Ga<b> y</b</b>> people with absolutely bizzare ideas about how society should submit to their particular beliefs, however they aren't representative about who LBGTQ+ are and sometimes we all have to be careful about who we ally ourselves with because there are some agendas way outside of that.Whilst there are some narcassist who wear their identity as a fashion accessory the majority <b> of <b> G</b</b>>ay people are often forced to hide who they are out of fear. Now, it is entirely possible that this is a self reinforced or irrational fear, it could be in fact a prejudice born out of ignorance that society is more accepting. If that is the case then a pride march can heal such rifts without it decending into a echo chamber<b> .The et</b>hnic communities do have a bigger internal issue with being LGBTQ+ and this has to be tackled too. It doesn't mean they are anti-white because they are speaking f<b> rom a </b>black pride platform. Though, there is still the danger of such things being hijacked by those with their own view who by happenstan<b> ce are</b> black and LGBTQ+. If they want to be heard properly then they need to ensure that they examine who speaks for them.There is alot that needs to b<b> e said</b>. Black peopl<b> e can b</b><b> e r<b> a</b</b>>cist. Gay people can be anti-trans even! Bigotry exists within all camps but people have to give good reasons for the things they believe rather embark upon groupthink.",
