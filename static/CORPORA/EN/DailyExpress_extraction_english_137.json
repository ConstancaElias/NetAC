        "postText": "'Yesterday, Rachel Riley, 33, faced calls for her to be sacked from Countdown after she wore a white T-shirt which featured a photoshopped image of Jeremy Corbyn carrying a placard which read: Jeremy Corbyn is a racist endeavour. The original photo of the Labour leader was one of him taken in 1984 when he was arrested while protesting against the South African apartheid.', 'The actual message on his placard read: Defend the right to protest against apartheid. Join this picket, but this was changed on Rachel\u2019s top.', 'Following the criticism, Rachel has thanked those who have sent her messages of support and vowed to continue her fight against Corbyn and the current Labour government.', 'Thanks for all the lovely messages of support, & all the silent supporters who\u2019ve followed me, means a lot, she wrote.', 'Shows how counterproductive nasty pile-ons actually are.', 'Rachel then referenced a promise she made last month, when it was announced there was going to be a general election in December, to not let an antisemetic government be in power.', 'She continued her post: I made this promise (finger pointing down emoji) I intend to keep it.', 'If this is the price to raise awareness then sobeit. Lots of love, she added alongside love heart emojis.', 'Rachel re-shared the promise she was referring to, which said: As we edge towards a December general election, a heartfelt promise:', 'I will do everything in my power to try to ensure my baby, Jewish by blood, will not be born under an antisemitic government.', 'I hope this will never happen, please use your vote wisely.', 'Earlier this week, Rachel uploaded a photo of herself wearing the Corbyn racist top to her Twitter account, @RachelRileyRR, in view of her 656,600 followers.', 'I didn\u2019t feel comfortable knowing my workplace was to be full of racists tonight, she captioned it.', 'I don\u2019t endorse Boris, but I do endorse #NeverCorbyn. Please see my pinned thread if you still don\u2019t understand why. #LeadersDebate #LabourAntisemitism.', 'Corbyn has strongly denied allegations of anti-Semitism during the controversy that has ripped through his party.', 'Rachel faced many negative comments following her statement, with some Twitter users calling for her to be sacked from her role on Countdown due to doctoring the apartheid statement and for her views on the Labour leaser.', 'The maths whizz, who is expecting her first child with husband Pasha Kovalev, defended her T-shirt on Twitter.', 'She wrote: Without feeding individual ignorant trolls, this is why I have no qualms using this photo to highlight Corbyn\u2019s racism.', 'Rachel then uploaded articles about Nelson Mandela declining to meet Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s anti-apartheid movement, who was part of the City of London Anti-Apartheid Group (CLAAG) during the eighties, with the group also connected to South African communist and ANC activist David Kitson.', 'She said: Without feeding individual ignorant trolls, this is why I have no qualms using this photo to highlight Corbyn\u2019s racism.', 'In a follow-up tweet, the Countdown star said: Why would Nelson Mandela be advised by actual anti-apartheid heroes not to meet Corbyn and his extremist group if they were so fantastic?'",

I'd like to think I have that too, which is why I will be voting Labour.",

Instead they were made to politicise their own needs under an all too wide a framework that had to include those who would ultimately replace them. Time for real change!",

As for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019 s TV appearance last night, I disagreed with much of what he said\u2013 but I admired his calm presence and his courtesy to the audience and questioners.Others would be well - advised to adopt these particular traits when trying to make their own points. Extreme Jews are as dangerous as those devoted to anti - Semitism.They are both, thankfully, in a significant minority.Long may it stay that way but there is no excuse for trying, against all odds, to make this a major feature of our General Election.
