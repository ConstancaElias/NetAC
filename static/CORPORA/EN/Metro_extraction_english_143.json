        "postText": "Nando\u2019s boss Colin Hill has apologised after a customer complained about a painting at a restaurant in Birmingham showing four black people in a toaster.', 'The artwork had adorned the walls of the branch in the Perry Barr area of the city, until a furious customer took it upon himself to contact Mr Hill directly on LinkedIn to vent his anger.', 'The man, a black property investor, said the picture was \u2018completely insensitive to one of the worst periods of human history\u2019.', 'He went into the branch the day after it opened for a bite to eat.', 'He said: \u2018It shows four people of colour who would have been historically subject to degradation and hardship in an implement \u2013 here, a toaster \u2013 used to cook or burn bread.', '\u2018It\u2019s an absolute disgrace that in this day and age, a painting like that can appear in as popular a food chain in modern Britain as Nando\u2019s.\u2019', 'Mr Hill confirmed the painting had been taken down and admitted it should have been removed before the restaurant opened to the public.', 'He added: \u2018It\u2019s depiction and potential interpretation had already been identified during our review of the restaurant before being open to customers and should have been removed.', '\u2018It was an oversight on our behalf that this hadn\u2019t happened before we welcomed our first guests.', '\u2018Each of our restaurants is individually designed and our creative design team select artists and their collections to complement the bespoke design.', '\u2018On this occasion something has gone wrong with our selection process for specific artworks which has enabled this piece and its potential interpretation to appear.', '\u2018I will be reviewing our process to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u2019', 'The customer accused Mr Hill of failing to take the situation seriously.', 'He commented: \u2018As a black man, I think this is completely unacceptable, weird, and deeply offensive.', '\u2018Many of my friends are white, and they\u2019ve said they are shocked by its depiction of what I can only assume is advocated racism.', '\u2018Someone will have gone out to buy artwork for the branch, and someone decided that this was an appropriate painting.', '\u2018Who on earth could have allowed this to happen?', 'After the customer wrote back, Mr Hill apologised again \u2013 and received a return message from the customer.', 'He wrote: \u2018You fail to realise there would have been children in the restaurant and a specific demographic that would have been highly offended by that picture \u2013 I don\u2019t understand how such an oversight could have occurred in a company of your stature \u2013 and indeed a company that houses an extremely diverse customer base that transcends race.', '\u2018I guess, in some part, the matter is closed.\u2019",
