        "postText": "A trans woman was spat at and abused outside her place of work by a man \u2018hanging around\u2019 despite police being called.', 'It comes as police recorded at 81% rise in the number of hate crimes reported.', 'Natasha, a policy and engagement officer with trans youth charity Mermaids, says she was spat on and abused outside a a former workplace, while with a vulnerable service user in Leeds.', '\u2018Last year I was assaulted,\u2019 she told Metro.co.uk. \u2018A guy came up and started shouting. He started spitting on me quite a few times. I called police saying, \u201cThere is this guy hanging around outside our building, this is an emergency.\u201d He was still in my face, shouting at me. When he realised I was on the phone to police, he walked away.\u2019', 'Police didn\u2019t respond, however, and the man returned around half an hour later.', '\u2018He was saying, \u201cYou are not really a woman\u201d and all that stuff,\u2019 Natasha said. \u2018I called police again and said, \u201cThis guy is back. It would be really good if somebody could come out.\u201d\u2018', 'She says she was just told to come into a station and give a statement, but the man couldn\u2019t be tracked down so it was not taken further.', '\u2018This is not how you go about dealing with transphobic hate crime,\u2019 Natasha said. \u2018We should have equal protection under the Equality Act.\u2019', 'She said the incident was \u2018very upsetting\u2019 and left her feeling police didn\u2019t take transphobia seriously \u2013 although she says since then, officers in West Yorkshire Police have been given training in how to deal better with reports of this nature.', 'New data showed that in the last year, 1,944 transphobic hate crimes crimes were recorded across England, Scotland and Wales, compared to 1,073 incidents between 2016 to 2017.', 'Some 44 constabularies from around the country were asked to disclose the number of incidents that were registered in each police force. Eight did not provide full substantial data for the BBC investigation.', 'Owl, a non-binary trans rights campaigner and columnist for Metro.co.uk, said: \u2018I\u2019m not at all surprised at this, and it reflects my own experiences and the experiences of trans people around me.', '\u2018Hostility towards trans people has been on the rise in the UK, and has been facilitated largely by the media. There are countless articles, headlines and news pieces that paint trans people as dangerous and vilify us constantly.', '\u2018The current climate is very much like it was back when Section 28 was enacted, and it\u2019s worrying that the media isn\u2019t being more critical of the type of opinions they platform. Trans people are afraid to leave their homes and participate in society fully, as they face discrimination and even hate crimes at all avenues.', '\u2018The UK has a serious problem when it comes down to responsible and ethical reporting and minority issues, and groups such as trans people are being affected disproportionally. I hope that news like this will serve as a wake-up call and more people start protesting against this treatment, as hate crimes and violence will only continue to increase if we continue down this road we\u2019re on.\u2019', 'Lee Clatworthy, vice chair of Sparkle, the National Transgender Charity said: \u2018The most worrying aspect of this massive increase in recorded transphobic hate crime is that we know that many more incidents go unreported, either because of a lack of trust in the police force, or because many trans people see verbal abuse or the threat of physical violence as a part of everyday life.', '\u2018The link between this increase in transphobic hate crime and the hostile environment surrounding gender diversity furthered by certain news outlets and on social media can also no longer be ignored.\u201d",

I could go into a long rant about the importance of the SRY gene, gene shuffling, displacement of a gene from one chromosome to another. Or I could mention androgen insensitivity and a multitude of other bits of science, like the psychology of<b>  gender</b>. But I'm not sure if it would be worth it. As a footnote I'm just a crust<b> y ol</b>d cishet guy who has th<b> is cra</b>zy idea that what's in someone else's underwear is none of my business unless there's mutually consen<b> ted sex</b>ual intimacy on the horizon.",
