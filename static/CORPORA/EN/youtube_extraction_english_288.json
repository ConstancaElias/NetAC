            "commentText": "After seeing the reverse hatred towards my team, our logo, and the city of Cleveland, I am going to state important facts and observations you may want to consider.  The prominent protester who's native american ADMITTED stealing $77,000 in funds for Native Americans.  He was sentenced to 4 months in jail and 4 months house arrest.  Shouldn't these Native Americans, and the rest of these protesters be outside of this man's house protesting how wrong it is to steal from Native Americans and how wrong it is to not practice what you preach?!  Second, I counted 5 people that yelled profanity or mocked them, and showed not even 2 full minutes of fans entering the park.  The park's current capacity is 34,726.  How can you call an entire fan base all <b> racist </b>that doesn't show the other 34, 721 individuals from all backgrounds entering the park that don't act like that?  Besides the ballpark itself, the Indians have over 1 million fans on Facebook alone, and across the entire country; so to make a generalized statement that our entire fan base is<b>  racist</b> based on a video clip that's not even 2 minutes long is an obvious false, and an inaccurate jump-to-conclusion analysis. I was out there for 2 games last August, so I can sit here and say I saw with my own eyes people from ALL walks of life who were wonderful, courteous, and would never do what is seen in the video above. FURTHERMORE, if sports teams are wrong for making money off of Native Americans, where are the current protests to change the Braves<b> , Blac</b>k Hawks, Chiefs,  and Redskins logos and names?  Yes, I'm confused too.  I happen to stand with the majority of fans including Native Americans that want to save the logo and are against the change, which is CONTINUOUSLY proven in multiple Cleveland and national polls to this day. In America, you have the right to your opinion, but you DON'T have the right to tell people how to think, feel, or what to believe.  With that in mind, I will close by saying 2 wrongs don't make a right, don't preach tolerance if you are going to be disrespectful yourself,  and don't be mean and attack your fellow man just because they hold a different view than your own.",

Did blacks dropped bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing millions of innocent civilians? Nope. Did blacks went invading country after country and taking land that is not their and then mistreated the natives? Did blacks had millions upon millions of Jews and non-Jews thrown into gas chambers, starvation, torture to death and other atrocious killings? Nope. Did blacks caused world war II, II - Korean, Vietnam and other wars? Nope. Are blacks the ones poisoning water and land with toxic waste, which causes fatal diseases? Nope. I can go on and on and on. Now compare all that to what blacks are doing to each other in certain cities. There is no comparison, really. Whites have done a lot more damage worldwide and throughout the centuries. So, please, stop trying to make blacks as the villains, while turning a <b> blind </b>eye at what whites have committed. Yes, all races and nationalities have done their share of damage, but people like you are known to point the finger at that guy, while 10 more are pointing at you. The hypocrisy need to stop.",

Who came to this continent and wrote history so that it is whitewashed to cover up genocidal practices such as the trail of tears,thanksgiving,and Columbus \"discovery\". Why are native americans the only ones who by law were forced to attend residential schools where they faced atrocities?Forcibly relocated?Why are the native americans women by law sterilized without consent? Native Americans have longer history on this continent then your heritage and you think its okay to tell them non native americans have the right to mock and trivialize their persons?Special kind of mentality working there.",

Cleveland is trying to change their image around. Even more so the MLB is trying to target inner city youths and get <b> black </b>kids back into baseball. Though we are not Native\" my community is very wary of any form of bigotry like behavior. For one it is wrong and secondly if they say that about NA imagine what they say about blacks, latinos\"etc.  Also with fans like this I wonder how they really view some of are players outside of the baseball umbrella(Lindor, Ramirez,etc.).\n\nI think due to the MLB trying to get more mainstream exposure, it is posdible that they may eventually change the name in the near future.",

Now if you want to compare the pre contact America to Europe the crime and murder in Europe was much more rampant and seen there the ratio was a million to one worse than here don't take the route of saying it was the same as Europe because in all reality it wasn't",

Not to mention<b>  ethnic</b> groups adopting the constitution of the mali empire, the Kurukan Fuga.\n\nI assume you're American seeing as you brought up the Rwandan genocide and that albino crap happening in East africa, which the media(even saying \"in parts of africa\") pushes heavy over there as some supe<b> r commo</b>n occurrence.\n\nThat \"whites are no more evil th<b> an bla</b>ck\" stuff is complete bullshyt. More proof that parents should homeschool their kids. The k12 program<b>  is noth</b>ing but propaganda and brainwashing.\n\nAnd if you want to bring up violence towards pregnant women, go look up mary turner in America or read some of the things Thomas thislewood did to his female slaves in his journal.",

Even though I chose not to wear it anymore, I didn't support forcing the team to change it. We had this same fight over my college's logo at the University of North Dakota and hated the change we were forced to make. After watching this, I get it. You are right, this is embarrassing for your city and it really makes me understand why the native Americans don't want these kind of people using their logo.  This is pathetic. I know this doesn't represent the whole of Cleveland, but that people can act so openly like trash is disturbing and does reflect on Cleveland",
