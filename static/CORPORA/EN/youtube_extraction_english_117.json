        "postText": " It's not the passage of time that makes it so hard to get older. It's ageism, a prejudice that pits us against our future selves -- and each other. Ashton Applewhite urges us to dismantle the dread and mobilize against the last socially acceptable prejudice. 'Aging is not a problem to be fixed or a disease to be cured,' she says. 'It is a natural, powerful, lifelong process that unites us all.'. . Check out more TED talks: http://www.ted.com. .

Comparing it to the other \"isms\" of the world is pretty ludicrous. And honestly, I don't think wanting to retain a youthful and healthy figure is something people can stop wanting naturally.  I've seen man<b> y ol</b>d people who look better and are more active than these younger people because they took care of themselves and ate healthy. Most of t<b> he o</b>ld people I see at the gym are fit and workout daily, which I give them props. We all have the power to control our destiny. I honestly believe that if you eat healthy,  stay active, save for retirement, becom<b> ing </b>old wouldn't be that bad. Retaining youth  doesn't make yo<b> u an ag</b>eist, it makes you smart because you're preparing for the future. What's stopping you from becoming  fit, financially well off, and spending<b>  you</b>r old years traveling instead of being in a nursing home eating pudding and sitting in a wheelchair?

Don't let exaggerations like that fool you into thinking a pervasive issue like <b> ageism </b>does not deserve attention. I might disagree with the SJWs in how to then address the issue, but I would never argue that it does not exist or is not important.\n\nTo suggest<b>  ageism</b> doesn't affect behavior is silly. Why do you think anti-aging products exist? I don't think they are some sort of crime against humanity like some people seem to, but I do think it's a symptom of an underlying beauty standard disfavoring th<b> e ol</b>d. The fact that people are prepared to pay top dollar for such items shows that these impacts are not so esoteric after all. People really do care, the impact is real and measurable. After all, a beauty standard is largely a cultural construct; other cultures have had vastly different ideas about beauty than the current Western culture.",

In Western cultures, older individuals are not seen as valuable members of society anymore. In other cultures, growing <b> old </b>is an honor and younger individuals hold them in reverence for their knowledge and wisdom. Aging in America is seen as a loss of life, in a way... all we see are anti-aging everything BUT an anti-aging diet, but that's another conversation. I will piggy back another poster in that the sociological construct of<b>  ageism</b> is created; however as w<b> e ag</b>e, processes change...its a biological fact. Not everything <b> is agei</b>sm, just like not everything<b>  is rac</b><b> ism, se</b>xi<b> sm or homop</b>hobia. There is an overuse of -ism's in American society now.

            "commentText": "She makes a few honest observations, then twists them into arguments for counterculture. \n She never differentiates between the fundamentals of corporate capitalism and competitive capitalism. She just alludes to the conclusion that capitalism is inherently evil. She all but openly states that human competition is a thing that should not be. \n Western competitive capitalism is what built the western world and has allowed us to reach this point where we can question everything, rather than be tied to spending every waking hour working for survival. Competition is the fuel of any free society. Without competition there would be no great inventors, no great athletes or artists. Humans didn't invent competition, nature did. When we compete we are only doing what we were born to do. This is why a freemarket based society thrives more than any kind of cooperation based models. Cooperation based societies caused over 100,000,000 deaths in the 20th century. \n We only have corporate capitalism because of cooperative minded policies. Corporate/bank bailouts, government strong arming through taxation to invest in the stock market, subsidy programs. Public welfare programs such as, social security, welfare, food stamps, socialized healthcare, planned parenthood, wic, public schools,  medicare/medicade, etc, etc... are all socialism. I'm not saying they are good or bad, only pointing out that if you're going to blame our problems on capitalism then at least realize we do not live in a capitalist system and haven't for almost a hundred years. Since these programs first started being implemented inflation has risen over 2300%. \n The first thing socialism requires is fiat currency because no country has enough gold in its reserves to pay for providing for all of its citizens needs. For a fiat system to \"work\" it's society must adopt a Keynesian economic model since it's currency is no longer a carrier of value, but only a placeholder of value. Real value is tangible and solid. Fiat is representative of an idea. \n All great empires and nations fell ultimately to inflation. Rome was only succesfully invaded when they could no longer afford to pay an army. In the end their currency was so worthless they wouldn't even accept it from their own citizens to pay their taxes and demanded to be paid in gold.\n This speaker appears to make sense on the surface but she is really prescribing how to kill freedom and prosperity.",

You don't extrapolate one case on everybody. You live in society, therefore<b>  nobody</b> owns you anything in the first place. People will not accept your subjective point of view at all cases, but this speaker implies that their feelings are more important than what people want to say. This i<b> s dum</b>b narrative, noone cares about what you think and you should no care either. It's this simple. Clouds are not cotton candy, and rivers are not milk. You are not child anymore, but a part of human community that can be harsh, disrespectful and rude. The world th<b> is wom</b>an is talking about is an impossible utopia.",

Also, I'm really happy to hear that you think my English is good, especially since my English exam is in two weeks. It is quite amusing to see some native English speakers for example mixing up \"they're, their and there\" or \"then, than\". Nevertheless, I think Finnish people are often good at English because we usually have no dubbing in for example shows and movies and many things are not translated to Finnish because of the language's small popularity so we are obligated to learn English as well as we can, contrary to for example Germany, where they are able to have many things available in their mother tongue so often they don't learn English in such a natural way as we Finns do.",

That's stronger than my personal interest in California's secession, heightened though it is by Trump's election. Of course, secession would have several advantages and some disadvantages to California and its citizens. However, I haven't researched this carefully, because it's not realistically possible for any state to secede. I was voicing my frustration with the fact that the U.S. is not a democracy but a republic. Specifically, the Electoral College, not the people, elect the president. We got George W. Bush with 47% of the popular vote as president, instead of Al Gore with 51%, and Donald Trump with 46% instead of Hilary Clinton with 55%. In practical terms, George W. Bush was elected by the Supreme Court 5 to 4, by its decision to stop the recount of votes in Florida.\n\nThis has <b> nothing </b>to do with my feelings.

But you watching salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t is shockingly bizzarre because the possibilities of some random American on the internet that has watched a Finnish tv show, are seemingly low. But yes I think the show is very shallow and does not really have a point to it :D and I don't know anything of the current plot of the show. Germans do have a lot of dubbing and such but it doesn't mean they aren't often fluent in English because they do have a good education and motivation to learn the language, it just makes it harder for them than for example Finnish people. My English exam is for gymnasium and I'm pretty sure it's not going to be very difficult for me but the highest grade is very tough to get and I'm happy with the second highest. And thank you for thinking that I'm at such a high level of English, you're making me more confident about my knowledge of the language. (Kiitos!)",

Even if we consider only the principal part, people fought back then with scientific facts and not their feelings. So your point plays against yourself.\n\nAnd our perception builds on our subjective view. If I see a man, that wants to be addressed like a <b> woman,</b> I would keep addressing to him like a man. If it's an actual man, but very feminine, I would address to him as a<b>  woman</b>, simply because my subconsciousness says that's <b> a woma</b>n. I do not deny the existence of these people, I simply want them to understand that they are a part of society and not society itself. They can not change the basics civilizations have been built upon. Up to this point, I don't see advances to reconcile people. I see only whiny cesspool of millennials trying to impose their feelings as absolutes for building a society.\n\nWell, I guess you give a man too much freedom and he loses himself.",

If a job requires you to lift 70 lbs and you can't because you're lorded and breaking down that's not a stereotype.",

When u get older u cant date an 18yr <b> old </b>girl, u can bang one sure but try having a conversation with her much less living as partners with her.

Counterbalance that against the snarky quip she made towards young people at 7:30. The rest of the video is entirely biased, talking about<b>  ageism</b> from the perspective that it's a phenomenon that negatively impacts people as they get older, tha<b> t ageis</b>m is discrimination against older people. This wasn't even remotely close to being an even-handed presentation.\n\nShe's full of it, just talking her book. When she starts talking about all the privileges that older people have, I'll start listening. Maybe then she could investigate what happens when politicians start talking about taking those special privileges away in the interests of fairness (which is what she should call for if she wants to truly fight for age-based equality). \n\nI've seen it first hand. It's us oldies who protest the most and fight tooth and nail to keep our special privileges. Like so many of the SJWs, the lady in this video is only interested in boosting the lot of her preferred tribe(s). She is NOT interested in actual equality.",

I'm curious why we as a culture let certain things slide and instantly proactive against other people for lesser things, albeit bad behavior. Still shaking my head for example why people like Kate Winslet will all of a sudden speak out against Weinstein but roll over to be in a Roman Polanski film when in 2011, his act of sodomy against a 13<b>  yea</b>r old girl is popular news that would have you questioning being even associated with him. \n\n\nDoes this make any sense?",

A person might be allowed to be free or justifiably free.  But there is no compulsion of nature that forces a mandate for a person to be free.  All person give up their freedom to function as sole actors in moral and ethical decision making the moment they enter into a community of others.  A person is free to make moral decisions that affect no one else solely when they live utterly independent and devoid of all interactions with all others.  That \"complexity\" you mention has no value because those whom she affects in her decision making have no legal authority for redress when her decisions harm them physically, sexually, intellectually, and/or emotionally.\n\n\"fertilized eggs are naturally aborted with normal menstruation\"\nActs of nature have no moral conviction.  This is a<b>  re<b> d</b</b>> herring.  And the correct term would be miscarried not aborted.  This is a straw man you conflated into t<b> he <b> r</b</b>>ed herri<b> ng.\n\nNot</b>hing in what you stated is valid ethical or moral reasoning.  It is only self-serving argument for a feminist lobby intent on maintaining a practice which is ethically more repugnant than slavery.  Slavery denied human beings liberty which denied them the pursuit of happiness.  Abortion denies identifiable human beings life which denies them liberty which denies them their choice to pursue happiness.\n\nYou have an option.  Either 1) Homosexuality is an abnormal result of genetics resulting i<b> n the s</b>exual identity of the person being driven by genetic outcomes, or 2) homosexuality is the result of experiential training on a mind that is tabula rasa.
