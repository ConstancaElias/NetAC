        "postText": "A student has been sacked from a student publication for transphobia after saying that \u2018women don\u2019t have penises\u2019.', 'Angelos Sofocleous was assistant editor of Durham University\u2019s philosophy journal Critique for just three days when he lost his job for tweeting the opinion that some found offensive.', 'He shared a Spectator piece on his personal Twitter account urging people who agreed to retweet the article.', 'His tweet led to his dismissal from the publication and he was \u2018forced\u2019 to resign as president-elect of Humanist Students.', 'In another blow, the postgraduate Philosophy and Psychology student was also dropped from his position as general editor of Durham University\u2019s online magazine, \u2018The Bubble\u2019.', 'In the now deleted-tweet, Mr Sofocleous shared an article titled \u2018Is it a crime to say women don\u2019t have penises?\u2019', 'Collecting hundreds of comments, the tweet has since sparked a row around Humanism, trans rights and freedom of speech.', 'Sofocleous\u2019 post received backlash from former chair of LGBT Humanists Christopher Ward, among others, who claimed the post was \u2018factually incorrect\u2019 and not \u2018worthy of a debate\u2019.', 'He wrote: \u2018As former chair of LGBT Humanists UK, the opposition I experienced from a number of longstanding Humanists members to trans people and trans issues was a stain on an otherwise great organisation.', '\u2018And here\u2019s the new President of Humanist Students RTing horrific transphobic shit.\u2019', 'But Mr Sofocleous has stood by his tweets and taken a swipe at his critics who he said \u2018cannot tolerate any criticism\u2019 and \u2018are unable to engage in a civilised conversation on issues they disagree on\u2019.', 'He also alleged that no effort had been made \u2018beyond name-calling\u2019 and \u2018derogatory comments\u2019 to try to dissuade him of his position.', 'Mr Sofocleous added: \u2018These are individuals who think they hold the absolute right to determine which ideas can be discussed and what language can be used in a public forum.\u2019', 'In August, Mr Sofocleous was sent an email from Ryan Lo, president of the university\u2019s Philosophy Society, saying the group had taken a vote to relieve him of his position, deciding his tweets served to \u2018belittle trans experiences\u2019.', 'Writing on the Critique journal\u2019s Facebook page, Mr Lo said the society has a duty to act in the \u2018best interests of all of its members\u2019 and is therefore \u2018committed to equality and diversity\u2019.', 'He said: \u2018When our executive team and group members vote on elections and group decisions, we encourage that they consider Durham SU\u2019s commitment to inclusivity, equality of opportunity for all, and the promotion of diversity.', '\u2018This includes all gender identities, but would emphasise that how each individual votes is a matter of personal judgment and interpretation.', '\u2018This is fundamental to the democratic spirit of our group and is why we have policies in place so these decisions can be voted on, not made arbitrarily.\u2019', 'The new editor-in-chief of Critique, Sebasti\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez-Schilling, tweeted saying he was \u2018happy to announce\u2019 the publication would not be \u2018tolerating trans-exclusionary radical feminists or bowing to their pressure\u2019.', 'The twitter row has sparked a fierce debate over free speech, with journalist Toby Young replying to Mr S\u00e1nchez-Schilling to ask him if he should be encouraging debate about \u2018important issues\u2019 instead of \u2018stifling it\u2019.",
