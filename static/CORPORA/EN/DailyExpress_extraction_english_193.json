        "postText": "'The upcoming general election has heated up with the first live debate between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on ITV. Mr Corbyn was called out by both host Julie Etchingham and the Tory leader when he refused to answer which side he would campaign for in a second referendum. He said: We will negotiate an agreement and we will put that alongside remain in a referendum. ', 'Ms Etchingham said: I 'm noting here of course that we haven't heard whether you would campaign for remain or to leave in that situation. ', 'Mr Johnson said: You 'll notice, Julie. I have answered your questions, but there is a glaring lacuna still in this debate. We still don't know.Is Jeremy Corbyn going to campaign for the deal he proposes to do or is he going to invite his Labour colleagues to destroy it ? That 's my question.', 'Viewers counted that the Labour leader avoided answering the question up to nine times.', 'The Conservative's official Twitter account wrote: So far, it's been 9 times Jeremy Corbyn has failed to say what his own position is on Brexit.', ' Speaking after the debate, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said: Well, there is no doubt that Jeremy Corbyn is a better debater than Boris Johnson, but on the key issue of the day, Brexit, nine times Jeremy Corbyn would not say as Prime Minister that a second referendum that he'd call, whether he'd vote Leave or Remain.', 'That is a failure of leadership.', ' Both leaders were also asked by an audience member if the union is worth sacrificing over Brexit.Mr Corbyn said there are clearly issues with Mr Johnson\u2019 s deal, adding it is damaging to the country, damaging to the rights we have at work and very damaging to manufacturing jobs. ', ' But Mr Johnson hit back, and raged: Mr Corbyn and the Labour Party, in order to secure power, are going to a deal with Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP to form a Corbyn/Surgeon coalition and the price of that would be a second referendum on the union with Scotland. We had one in 2014, and we don\u2019t need another one. Why put this great country through another referendum?', 'Mr Corbyn hit back: There won\u2019t be a coalition between Labour or anyone else. No deal have been done.', ' But Mr Johnson hit back, and raged: Mr Corbyn and the Labour Party, in order to secure power, are going to a deal with Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP to form a Corbyn/Surgeon coalition and the price of that would be a second referendum on the union with Scotland.', 'We had one in 2014, and we don\u2019 t need another one. ', 'Why put this great country through another referendum?', ' Mr Corbyn was also challenged about anti - Semitism in his party. ', ' He replies: Racism in any form is a surge on our society.', ' I have taken action in my party where anyone that has committed any anti - Semitic acts, they are suspended or expelled from the party. ', 'We are deadly serious about this.', 'We have to stand up against racism in any form of our society.'",
