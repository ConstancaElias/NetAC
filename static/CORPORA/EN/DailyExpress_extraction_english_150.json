        "postText": "The five - all of whom were speaking on condition of anonymity to protect their \u201cprivate friendships\u201d with the former Suits actress - banded together to support Meghan, who married Prince Harry last year, and who has been the victim of vile abuse from trolls on social media in recent months.', 'One, described as a former co-star who lives in Los Angeles, told People Magazine they were speaking out \u201cstand up against the global bullying we are seeing and speak the truth about our friend\u201d.', 'She added: \u201cMeg has silently sat back and endured the lies and untruths.', '\u201cWe worry about what this is doing to her and the baby.',' '\u201cIt\u2019s wrong to put anyone under this level of emotional trauma, let alone when they\u2019re pregnant.\u201d', 'Meghan is tipped to have her baby in March or April - but hateful users of Twitter have waged a relentless campaign against her ever since she confirmed her pregnancy the day after the wedding of Princess Beatrice to Jack Brooksbank in October.', 'They have also left other vicious messages about her appearance and even her mental health.', 'One user accused Meghan of wearing an inflatable baby bump while another claimed: \u201cHer tummy was deflated and then swollen again as she moves around.\u201dAt the start of this year, Express.co.uk highlighted phoney claims by The Gossip Girl, who posted a picture of a New York model called Bobbie Grei, falsely claiming the snap was of Meghan, while making shocking claims about her character which Express.co.uk has chosen not to repeat.Prince Harry issued a statment via Kensington Palace in November condemning a \u201cwave of harassment\u201d against Meghan.The statement added: \u201cSome of this has been very public - the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments.', '\u201cIt is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms Markle should be subjected to such a storm.', '\u201cHe knows commentators will say this is \u2018the price she has to pay\u2019 and that \u2018this is all part of the game\u2019.', '\u201cHe strongly disagrees. This is not a game \u2013 it is her life and his.\u201dIt was revealed this week that Meghan had drafted in Serena Williams\u2019 crisis management team in a bid to \u201cto set the record straight and shut everything down\u201d in the face of the ongoing claims.', ''Royal watcher Richard Fitzwilliams telling Express.co.uk the situation was \u201cbizarre\u201d and \u201cvery difficult to control\u201d.He added: \u201cMany of these comments are vicious and are keen to provoke some sort of a war between the fans of the duchesses.', '\u201cObviously there is no historical precedent as social media is relatively recent.', '\u201cRoyal fans tended to be admiring but detractors or publicity seekers didn\u2019t have weapons where they could get an audience like this. How times have changed.\u201d",

MM has made it clear she does not want to join the RF but to change it and directly influence it with her SJW far - left beliefs and infiltrate her SJW contacts into the royal circle. To many British people this is unwanted, outrageously political, and negative to the detriment of our royal family.We don\u2019 t need or want an American actress from a dysfunctional family that constantly makes personal demands of the Queen to enlighten or\u2018 modernise\u2019 our thousand - year - <b> old </b>royal house thanks very much.What do her\u2018 special friends\u2019 call that ? Her husband is now post marriage to MM estranged from his only brother and his wife after years of happy and loving family relations\u2013 what does MM and her\u2018 special friends\u2019 call that ? MM has added<b>  nothing</b> to our royal family but division and genuine public disquiet and concern.The royal house is not an edition of \u2018Oprah\u2019 and her friends are not on taking us down the route of \u2018The View\u2019!",
