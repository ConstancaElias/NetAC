        "postText": "Mr Corbyn was taking questions after unveiling 451 pages of uncensored documents which he claims show the NHS is up for sale in a Tory Brexit deal with the US. But when he was again asked to apologise to the Jewish community for antisemitism within the party, a visibly annoyed shadow international development secretary Mr Gardiner intervened.', 'He said: \u201cDo you have a question about the issue we are actually discussing today or was that just an opportune moment to get a dig in about something else?\u201d', 'His reaction was swiftly condemned on social media.', 'Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan tweeted: \u201cWow. The breathtaking arrogance of this chump telling journalists what questions to ask.', '\u201cThey should all ignore him and pummel Corbyn about antisemitism.\u201d', 'Mr Corbyn did go on to address the anti-semitism row later in the press conference.', 'He said: \u201cI have made it very clear antisemitism is completely wrong in our society, our party did make it clear when I was elected leader, and after, that antisemitism was unacceptable in any form in our party or our society.', '\u201cAnd did indeed offer its sympathies and apologies to those that had suffered.\u201d',  'Today\u2019s election event came after a torrid day for Mr Corbyn in which he refused to apologise over anti-semitism despite condemnation from the Chief Rabbi.', 'And his claims on the NHS were dismissed by the Tories who insist the documents on which he based them only explicitly mentioned the NHS four times.', 'Trade Secretary Liz Truss said: \u201cJeremy Corbyn is getting desperate and is out-and-out lying to the public about what these documents contain.', '\u201cHe has always believed in conspiracy theories - which is why he has failed to crack down on the scourge of antisemitism in his party.', '\u201cThis is the man that has caused huge offence by blaming an imaginary \u2018Zionist lobby\u2019 for society\u2019s ills and now he has decided to smear UK officials too.', '\u201cPeople should not believe a word that he says - this stunt is simply a smokescreen for the fact that he has no plan for Brexit and that he has been forced to admit that he wants to increase taxes for millions of families.', '\u201cAs we have consistently made clear: the NHS will not be on the table in any future trade deal and the price that the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table.', '\u201cThis sort of conspiracy theory fuelled nonsense is not befitting of the leader of a major political party.\u201d', 'Mr Corbyn insisted a Labour Government would be \u201cthe most anti-racist Government you\u2019ve ever seen\u201d.', 'He said: \u201cBecause that is what I\u2019ve spent my whole life doing - fighting against racism - and I will die fighting against racism.\u201d",

Every hospital, clinic, GP is a separate organisation.Your GP is actually a private contractor working for the NHS.You can 't privatise the NHS. You can commission care at private organisations, this is typically done where it can be done quickly and cheaply. The NHS cannot borrow money to invest like the private sector can.The NHS is not efficient and relies on old technology and procedures as a result.Failures are expensive and therefore the private sector focuses on cost meaning they invest in better machinery and techniques.If the patient does well they aren 't suing.",

His claims that the Tories intend selling the NHS to the Americans just came over as groundless scaremongering.  To me, he appeared as a foolish li.ar.  It was obvious what his objectives were.

I said to myself a long time ago, the conspiracy is - there is no conspiracy. Conspiracy hides the truth. We humans function best when we deal with what's in front of us, what is real, truth, and factual in our daily lives. If we keep a watch of that, then we're halfway there!",
