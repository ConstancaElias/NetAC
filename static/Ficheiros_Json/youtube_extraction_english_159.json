Whoever made rules for the beauty community must not be of a certain age group in the mature community, or if they are maybe they came from a generation or never felt the need to wear or do certain things. I always tell people to wear what makes them happy, and what they enjoy. In my book there are no rules at all, I go with it, and smile :) Have a good weekend, you now got me intrigued to do a video also about this very thing. XOXO <3",

I too hate when skin care and cosmetics demonstrate products on younger women who have no visible need for it like u see with eye creams, etc\nThank you for doing this awareness campaign. \nI will be joining the YouTube community soon to talk and show woman with physical limitations using beauty products. As we age sometimes we develop arthritis and other functional limitations that make us adapt or repurpose tools and products to meet our needs. But make no mistake we are also extremely passionate about beauty products and have been gravely overlooked for yrs",

Thank you for speaking up for all of us mature ladies.",

    "commentText": "Im sorry but I'm going to have to disagree with you 35 mature skin really?? I don't think so even 40 is NOT mature skin at all! even 50 isn't mature skin things don't really start changing I'm talking about actual wrinkles not lines! Tell about age 56 around there. although I will say for me I'm a natural blond and we do age quicker it's the pigment of our skin so about the age of 49 i guess I had to start totally wearing different eyeshadow colors that I never would have worn when I was younger! and had to start reapplying makeup totally different otherwise I looked like a clown literally!!I'd always been able to wear a lot of crazy colors but dark Browns and BLACK EYELINER was my number one look!!black eyeliner does NOT work for me at all anymore I look like a streetwalker nor do the brown eyeshadows and lipstick colors I could wear any and every color which I can't do anymore especially dark colors that's very aging especially when they're Matt I never really wore Foundation just blush and bronzer I still can't stand the foundation I don't really have age spots I'm 61 but yeah I won't buy a lot of products because it's promoting an anti-aging product especially moisturizers or eye creams they're promoting and have a 13 to 20 year old up there as the model I simply WON'T BUY their product!! Because that SCREAMS to me it is NOT an ANTI-AGING PRODUCT at all ! Thanks so much for sharing",

That just shows us that everyone is different. And you're right we don't have mature skin at 35, but using anti-aging products at that age would really help stave off wrinkles as we get older. thank you so much for watching xx",

Fast forward to March 2018 & I started dabbling in makeup again. BOY is it so different than it was back then. BUT the only thing that hasn‚Äôt changed is the ‚Äòyoung perfect looking models‚Äô that companies use to sell their product. I understand they do what they have to, to attract the public BUT it‚Äôs giving younger generations the wrong impression. ‚ÄúWear this and you‚Äôll look perfect‚Äù or ‚Äúwear this and you‚Äôll have radiant skin(for life)‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt work that way. These companies definitely need more mature models, say 45 & up that actually have some wrinkles to show that hey, even though we age we still want to look beautiful as well !! We‚Äôll age gracefully !!! Hugs girl xoxox",

I am now 53 and still continue to use it, although now I do use much more products under my makeup (such as primer, moisturizers etc) to make sure my make up still looks good on me. I love to wear false eyelashes and look at all the makeup trends and I also love to buy much of the new products that come out.....so not sure why makeup companies would think that you are no longer significant once you reach a certain age. Plus, as you pointed out, I am at that age where my kids are grown and I can afford to pamper myself more (although I must admit I always have).",

It talks about following the baby boomers, us! We are still the larger percentage, and now with more disposable income. Our era did dress to the nines ( remember the 80's) along with makeup. It was out there, including our hair. So you're right, why would we stop looking our best. If anything increased it's the mega bucks we spend on skin care, since we didn't need it when we were sooooo young. The best thing that happen to our generation, is YouTube, and wonderful beauty creators ( like yourself) that spends your hard earned money, so we can make better product choices, depending on our skin types. Keep up the hard work. Lots of, love, and hugs üë≠üíï",

And it's very disheartening when I see these young girls that started the same time as I have and have clearly bought their subscribers and they have huge PR coming there way.  I watch this one gal, who is super sweet, but it's clear that she bought her subscribers. We started the same month and she has 300,000 subscribers, but she only has 2,000 views on her videos.  Those numbers don't add up, but she is getting notices by all of the big cosmetic companies.  It's hard to see, but I guess if you're not afraid to lose your integrity, then you could get noticed.  So ridiculous.  See, there I go again, another rant.  Thank you for always being here with me and encouraging me.  It means so much to mean, you don't know. Lots of luvs xx",

    "commentText": "Spot on Melissa.  What makes the most impact with cosmetic companies? Stop buying! Letters and calls are great and may get you some lip service but money is the bottom line- always. There are so many cosmetic/skin care  companies now that we can be selective. If you see an add with a 20 something woman advertising anti-aging products stop patronizing that company.  Personally, I feel the same about skin care companies that blatantly make claims about a product that are patently false. Companies arrogantly assume that people will not read the ingredients or research the validity.  As mature women, we are smarter than that! And with YouTube there are some great, easily accessed  resources  that enable us to take responsibility for what we put on our faces and bodies. I find it abominable that L'Oreal and Lancome have two new foundation products they have labeled as \"broad spectrum SPF\" when the only filter is octinoxate. Octinoxate does not filter UVA rays, the rays that go deeper, cause skin damage, destroy collagen and contribute to cancer. Because they are categorized as make up and not as sunscreens they do not have to meet FDA testing. Thanks for expanding this discussion. Hugs to you.",

A lot of kids can't even tell time on a regular clock anymore.  It makes me sad what's happening to our young ones. I didn't know that about the FDA testings & sunscreens.

You have a great point that the companies might think our generation wants to play it ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and not experiment - actually I experiment MORE now because I can‚Äôt just slap on any ol‚Äô concealer, powder, or lipstick like before (liquid lipstick? Not happening. Ever) I used to buy the same things over and over 20 or 30 years ago. I‚Äôm also way more picky than I used to be because of experience with makeup in general, like everyone else who‚Äôs over 25. One thing I will say that bothers me that isn‚Äôt talked about for sensitivity reasons -  big channels with millions of subscribers (who take in every word they say) are very vocal about discrimination when it comes to shade range, saying companies don‚Äôt acknowledge all demographics and only cater to certain skin tones, and that‚Äôs a valid point. They will literally boycott and encourage others to follow suit to send the companies a ‚Äúmessage‚Äù. Ok, great, but I never hear any of them complaining that certain age demographics are being excluded. I‚Äôm sure the companies are making what sells and don‚Äôt need to consider age (in their minds) because they are making money regardless. I hope this makes sense.",

    "commentText": "Melissa you took the words right out of my mouth!  These are my EXACT feelings about the beauty community!  The only companies I have seen who use more mature women in their campaigns are Lancombe and Covergirl.  I wonder what all the other brands would think it all of a sudden we stopped supporting them the way they stopped supporting us at a certain age?  I feel sure that we are spending more money on products whether it be for ourselves or for our daughters and granddaughters.  A 15 does not have the money for Two Faced, but Mom may!  \nI also think the beauty community within platforms like YouTube and Instagram are sending the wrong message to our youth.  I think more and more young people feel like looks are all you need in life, that everyone focuses their time on perfect makeup and then capturing each second of their lives with selfies.  What do I have has become more important than who am I.  It's sad and it's going to affect the future.  Beauty gurus don't have perfect lives.  They work hard, have ups and downs, heartbreak, frustrations.....just like everyone else.  However the younger ones portray perfect lives, perfect homes, perfect makeup, unlimited money all the time.  The younger generation is striving to be like their favorite YouTuber but the problem is that YouTuber is only showing their viewers as much of them as they want us to see.  We are seeing editing and pieced together parts of their lives.\nThe message across the board needs to change.  Hugs Melissa!",

It's unattainable and the ones that are the most popular aren't giving an accurate representation even of what they have.   Aside from the non brand support, there is also the insecurity that older youtubers are contending with.  I mean, like me, I know that not being recognized after 2+ years is hard when you see girls that started the same time as me that have 200K or 300K.  It's hard. And yes the message must change...luv ya xxxx",

It is the exact opposite because we are getting wrinkles, age spots and things like that so we want to make ourselves look the best we can. I quit wearing makeup for almost 20 years and I started back up this past year because I had some health problems in 2016 that changed how I looked for a while and it made me feel bad about myself. I am healing and starting to look more like I use too but¬†I realized that¬†even without the health problems, I don't look like I did 20 years ago which is a duh because I will be 48 this year and therefore my 20's was long ago. ¬†So, you go girl!!!!",

I had a freak accident in 2009 that left me in a wheelchair or on crutches between the 3 surgeries I've had since then (surgery #4 coming up), so I gained over 50 pounds and with all the steroids I didn't look like ME at all. Then a few years ago I developed a chronic illness and when I had to give up my career, severe depression kicked in. I stopped wearing makeup and stopped caring how I looked. My husband divorced me (was final earlier this year). But I lost 70+ pounds a year ago and that gave me motivation! About 6-8 months ago, I started watching Beauty videos and getting into makeup. I'd used the same drugstore stuff for 35 years (I'm 50), and I'd never heard of any other brands except maybe Clinique. Haha! So, everyone comes to this point in their lives differently and at different ages. Just keep it up this time! I'm never giving up on myself again... I'm single and now is the time I REALLY need to look good. üòÅ HUGS for more healing!!! ü§óü§óü§ó",

But I thanked them... I like the sixties so far. Better then adjusting to my age in my fifties. So embrace your age, look into anti inflammatory diets, love your skin care, and I thank my lucky stars I started skin care early on, and if you haven't, embrace it now, its your most productive quiet time to spend with your self, and use your Sunscreen all seasons, on sunny or cloudy days. (Notice I didn't mention exercise, hmm...That's a thought to add to your bucket list). Oh and if you want a chuckle, do look on the Estee Lauder web site and look at the GIRLS, promoting EL products, if one of them is over 16 years old, I will be shocked. But I love love Estee Lauder, used it since I was 30, adore the Advanced Night products.",
