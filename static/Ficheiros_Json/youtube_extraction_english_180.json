 "postText": " This shocking one-hour documentary special takes us into the mini world of children who so desperately want to be celebrities at the age of 10 that they are already living the celebrity lifestyle; encouraged by their parents. We meet a 10 year old girl who tells us she is on 'the list' as a potential match for Prince William. At the age of 8 her mother started her on a daily beauty regime, including a ¬£200 per month hair routine, to prepare her for what lies ahead and as she reaches her 11th birthday, celebrating with a 'vogue party' she agrees with her mum that ‚Äòyou can never be too prepared for super model status! And it's not just the girls. Brothers, Skip and Frost, aged 10 & 12, are professional DJ's travelling from Cardiff to Ayia Napa. They know that networking is key to their success and are known as the So Solid Kids because they are best friends with group So Solid Crew and they want everything this successful adult band has.

Beauty is great but a companion in life or a career in anything, even modelling is going to depend on being able to discuss more than brands and who wore what. A personality and intelligence and charm and caring for others and interest in anything other than oneself is massively important. Shame on these mothers!!!",

Besides which there are Child Employment Laws in this country that say that school aged children cannot work during school hours,  or after 7 pm ...they cannot work for more than 2 hours on Sunday to Friday during term time.... and that's beside the fact that children cannot legally work until they are 13 years old......these children are being exploited and denied a childhood...the adults in this video are breaking the law",

    "commentText": "When they were talking about who they want to marry really upset me for some reason. They were talking about how they want to marry a rich man, and all that.. and they will probably grow up still thinking like that. So that means if they see someone not as rich as they would like them to be, they are not even going to look at them, speak to them, or even notice they're even there. If they see a rich, handsome man they will go for him, and say they \"love\" him, and he will say the same because they are pretty, and rich like himself. The thing is.. what about that poor guy you never even looked at? He turned out to be the nicest person in the whole world, who was sweet, kind, incredible, friendly, and respectful, and still lacking money. But this rich guy... he had a big house, a fast car, posh clothes, but guess what. That is the person that will one day break your heart. He is unkind, disrespectful, and only wants you for the glamour and fun, not for love.\n\nI'm not saying every rich/poor person is like this, but I just want to make a point that the stuff on the OUTSIDE, shows nothing on the inside. And the inside is the most important. \n\nThis goes to any lady/man looking for their lover... meet the person before you go for them.",

(if they find anyone dumb enough to put up with them) What also makes me pity them (mainly the girls) is that they think rich = beautiful / better / talented . so when they're older they'll be having plastic surgery because no one thinks they're as pretty/great as they themselves were taught to think.\n\nBeauty pageant moms are the worst though because those kids don't always enjoy what they're forced to do... \"live mom's dreams\"",

I only made it ten minutes into the video before I had to turn it off. Lastly, this video clearly proves that ‚Äúbeauty is in the eye of the beholder‚Äù as evidenced by the simple fact that I felt like NONE of the mothers or daughters were even the slightest bit pretty. Cute maybe but pretty? Really? Mini Model is not cute as a child and needs some serious work on the teeth and her mother was a real model??? She was not attractive. Huge nose, awful hair, just simply average. I can‚Äôt believe she got paid for being a model. Maybe the UK sees beauty under another lense, obviously!!! Good luck in your future girls. You have so much to look forward to I.e.: cocaine whores, alcoholics, boring and unintelligent women....all thanks to their moms. Ciao!!!",

They see it as this cool thing they can do and get bored. The difference between these kids and kids today is these parents are encouraging and involved in what they're doing. Most kids today aren't supervised, just blindly given what they want.",

Lead by example, so these people  criticize they become hypocrites on the matter)  \"give them what they need\" (mothers are litterally prostituting themselves to try and earn money for medical bills, and her they are getting sick of all the high end shops in the neighborhood, lord knows how much ACTUAL money is spent on TRIVIAL things), one of the first \"qualities\" the girls wanted was he had to be rich. (So hes gotta be rich, tall, blond, and a kind facade. How about a decent humble guy with morals and ya know...someone who loves you and not just how you look?!!) And talking all about moderation and seeing models in magazines and the girls wanting to be them, it's sickening. Is having bad things bad? No, but like the mom says \"in moderation\" you think fish net tights on a 11-12 year old girl is in moderation??!!) And the girl talking about being caught doing something your not supposed to do, well, here's an idea, STOP ONLY THINKING OF YOURSELF and don't do it. And people wonder why people like this are self centered and corrupt bad influences and examples. God help us, cuz nothing else can.",

I have no interest in makeup, I never wear contact lenses even though I'm really really short-sighted, I always wear my glasses as much as they get in the way, definitely never wear heels, no interest in fashion whatsoever. I don't know what kind of upbringing these kids parents had, but raising a child solely for the intention for them to be rich and famous us something I absolutely don't believe in. So, in conclusion, I firmly believe that this is not well thought-out style of parenting, these kids won't have had happy childhoods and teenage years, and they may develop mental illness due to missing out on key moments and having a childhood where they were oversexualised and taught to act older than their age.",

Their parents aren‚Äôt suffering and they have better relationships with their parents than anyone I‚Äôve known, I don‚Äôt really see the big issue. They‚Äôre happy, they're parents are happy.",

This, makes people think she  was of aristocratic birth, of marriageable age, \"coming out\" into aristocratic society in front of the reigning monarch.  Sally was a 4 years old farmer's daughter when Queen Elizabeth stopped the nonsense in 1958.  She grew up to be a TV actress. The \"child/women\" comment is just nauseating & the comment about 10-year-olds running their own social lives was just....well...ludicrous!  These are obnxious mothers with a little  money to play with & their children are growing into adulthood with warped values, all learned at mummy's knee.  I hope that these children have grown up to be thoughtful, decent human beings, in spite of their egocentric upbringing.",

I think these parents are just spoiling their kids by bringing them into the modelling world at such a young age because they would miss their childhood and they are matured and so spoilt at the age of 10,11 and so on. These parents are just too selfish for themselves by making their child fulfilling their own dreams. This should not be encouraged and should be banned. I feel quite pity for these children for not being brought up in the right way by their parents. I won't be blaming these children to be so because they are innocent and that is why they are listening to their parents advices, infact I blame the parents for not for not bringing them up in the right way. I wonder what would happen to them when they grow up. \nthank you because this is an important matter to discuss about.",

The model/socialite/it girl lifestyle and the need to \"look good\" seems a bit shallow and empty to me but despite that, the girls seem charming kind and polite. The So Solid kids are wonderful and ambitious and the opinions and support of their parents and mentor are great in my book. Having money is obviously a potential breeding ground for demanding, selfish and rude behaviour but none of the kids in this presentation seem to display this. They have money and/or are money driven but have also been taught that you have to work for it. \"We're not encouraging materialism, we're just servicing a market that's there\" that sort of comment is not the sort of thing an uncaring parent would say ...good luck to them.\nIf you were born into money, that's not your fault, it's not EVEN a \"fault\". I hope they all ended up as happy successful adults ...rich or otherwise ...and I vote labour ;-)",

It was an emotionally jarring experience, that has left me seriously thinking of how I can help children like these and contribute to making this world a better place. If only I was wealthy enough to donate money to assist with counselling, legal fees, providing better housing and education, etc. \nSo now, watching the opening story of this film...seeing these spoilt 'it' girls and their mothers who encourage and support their narcissistic, materialistic lifestyles....just makes me disgusted. Instead of insisting that her daughter follow that expensive beauty regiment, why doesn't that mother insist that she learn about the struggles other girls her age are facing and commit to setting aside some of that money to help them afford to just survive their childhood?",

This is whats wrong with today's brats, while some children as young as 7 in poor countries, are trying to support their siblings & parents working 7 days a week...Send these lil bitches & their insignificant Mothers to live on the streets in India, Ukraine, Bulgaria etc etc..Then they just might, have some vision beyond their own little worlds, which to be honest, is not unique, not special, nothing, just sheep, trying to fit in and be like everyone else.",

The sexualisation of children and the deconstruction of childhood and the family along with the dumbing down of society from generation to generation are purpose driven social engineering tools. Parents are the only ones who can counterbalance this Narcissistic movement however as it gets imprinted with each new generation consciousness and critical thinking diminishes and they are the ones ushering it in. Depression and anxiety and mental Ill health amongst young people is prevalent and there's no mystery as to why. We cannot solve internal issues with external solutions. Feed the soul.",

At that age and into their teens, girls are very self conscious and kids tease eachother a lot and so parents then generally teach their children that they don't have to always put on a face for their peers or the world who might tease them for not fitting some criteria, (most certainly not paparazzi). Also,  the girl has dreams for her life to be an A list celeb (it's great that she's dreaming about her future) it's also okay if she wants a rich husband,  but her reason for that is for someone to look after her. Generally children her age raised with true confidence look forward to being totally independent, they'll fantasize about  all the things they'll hab e as an adult and imagine themselves being the enablers of their fantasy. I just feel that a disproportionate amount of their identity comes from outside at a stage in a child's life where they are establishing their own identity. It appears that they have an over reliance on external validation, thats not  healthy for building self esteem. Poor kids and they are such sweet hearts, ah (nice shoes and clothes = nice person)? My heart breaks.",

You get such a short time to be a kid & such a LONG time as an adult, let them enjoy being a kid! I like the idea that they're setting goals & looking at their future though. I knew what I wanted to be at 3. I worked exclusively towards that goal. Then, at 20, life pulled a dirty trick on me & the life I envisioned went POOF! Thankfully though, my parents made sure I was well rounded enough to find another career path. When I was younger, I thought it was a waste of time to do anything that took me off \"my path\". Thank goodness I had great parents!",

I agree, her bracelet looks like a hairbrush, and making a sly remark isn't doing that much harm.\n(By the way, you must be sick all the time if this comment is so sickening to you. \n\nAs young people there isn't much we can do about what's happening in the world. We have no voice, so we see no point in voicing our opinions. If there's no one to listen, then there's no voice to be heard.\n\nIt's a privilege to have what seems to be such pointless priorities. We're able to care about small things that have no worth or impact. Instead of verbally attacking everyone who doesn't devote every second of their life helping those who have less then us, just respect the gift we have; to lead such simply and meaningless lives. We can't care for everyone. Everyones individual circles seems so important then what each others circles do. \n\nDon't be that person.",

Shes but one of millions of self- absorbed, self-gratifying nouveau riche people in this world But what is it to you? At least these children have goals are driven and work towards them. They're determined to be successful and EARN their own money! I just dont understand people today. Isnt there enough hate and division going around  to invest your time and energy is ridiculous. And Its not funny. It shows not only how evil and nasty you are for wishing such a horrible fate for a child but bitter resentful and may i add a bit jealous; bashing these children and their lifestyles by wishing their fate be a terminal illness. Just exposes what kind of heartless ,evil human being you are. I thinl you should be quite ashamed of yourself. I'd re-examine your morals and ethics and figure out where all this anger and resentments coming from!",

I simply said that I hadn't found it snide, and then I mentioned my own anorexia to show that someone who suffers from an ED can see some truth to original comment, regardless of how ignorantly it was phrased. I have suffered from anorexia most of my life, ever since losing a third of my body weight at the age of 8, and I am all too familiar with its fatality. Even though my own illness runs so much deeper than \"pressure on looks\", the truth is that at least half of the girls I met in various treatment facilities over the years began starving themselves in their mid-to-late teens as a result of pressure to look a certain way. Also, through modeling I directly witnessed casting directors tell very thin girls that they needed to lose weight; literally every single one of my friends who model is restricting or purging. It's sad but it's honestly common. Sorry for the long comment lol, just wanted to explain where I'm coming from. I sincerely wish you the best in your recovery, Skyler. It is so god damn hard to fight that voice. Sending hugs and good vibes your way from NYC. Xx",

She is not a super model, but given she has lost her mom, whom she cared for very deeply I don't think she puts too much emphasis on being a celebrity so much these days! When her mom was first diagnosed with breast cancer, she was in an interview and rushed home to be with her! After her mom's cancer metastasized, spreading to her bone and liver, she put her life on pause so she could nurse her back to health! Sadly her mom died in 2014 after a hard and very brave fight against the disease!",
