The episode is called Sounds of Silence in Season 8",

Can‚Äôt hardly believe people are actually like this, sadly this is starting to become the norm in a lot of different places in the world. I hope you have a great great day @Sydney Watson, and I cannot wait until the next video about these crazy leftists trying to smash the patriarchy (those last three words made me cringe a bit, my apologies if they make you cringe a bit as well) Keep up the great work, the more people that know how things are going in the world the more opportunities there are to fix this total mess of a world. Oh and if someone tells you they‚Äôre offended then I have noticed that if you tell them you‚Äôre offended because they‚Äôre offended it tends to really mess with them an might cause them to cease being offended to prevent offence being given üòéüëç using their own language against the left can be quite humorous at times üòéüëç Take care and be safe üòáüëçüëç",

It is not only completely immature, but it's also an enormous red flag for mental health professionals as it's downright crazy and likely means these types of people are plagued by severe cognitive, emotional, and social underdevelopment. To the point, it's genuinely concerning that we're seeing this on such an ever-increasingly large scale. Bottom line, these \"Karens'\"  honestly just need something to complain over and then champion so that they may feel significant. Along with ensuring that all the other \"Karens\" /  everyone doesn't forget how \"virtuous\" they are. Likely because even they themselves know, that aside from their perceived personal virtue, that their lives are completely useless. As they don't even come close to contributing anything of substance to society, aside from the countless inane immature and misconstrued understandings of what real social justice is. It would be more than safe to wager that most of these people actually have a sub-conscious gnawing pit in their gut that they aren't truly championing social justice and are rather doing the opposite.",

The first generation feminists from my generation (60s into the 70s) were willing to compete  with men  and have competed and earned their place. These 3rd generation feminists now see that they must compete on a heads-up basis and they don't want to do that ;they just want the whole deck stacked in their favor with all the chips on their side of the table. I've listened to quite a few of very prominent first generation business women/ feminists who dislike this whole 3gf attitude of having to give women extra consideration because, as they see it , it trivializes all that they've accomplished in their whole life.",

If there were more females represented in a group than males and someone outside the group wished to gain the attention of the group, they could refer to the group as \"gals\" and I -- as a guy -- would be okay with that (despite what Karen the commie proposed). Women have had the opportunity to do this for some time now, but apparently just prefer to use \"guys\" to address all mix-gendered groups (or otherwise). I've always believed the reason for this is so that women can blend in with males, for the age old reasoning behind women desiring to invade (and be accepted in) male spaces.

I swear these leftists are the zombies of the apocalypse from revelations lol!\n\nEver heard a leftist say I am sorry, I had my head up my ass cause I believed the TV and The Internet, I should of did my own research, and made sure I got the truth using my heart and soul, before I used my emotions and ego? Odds are you probably never will, they would rather serve evil without even knowing it, and play right along out of sheer fear and ignorance, all because some religion told them if they sin they will burn in eternal fire, they would rather believe after death nothing happens or serve their ego or believe they are a god, instead of just reading what jesus taught, he was even correcting religion as child, that's why they murdered him, because what he taught made sense and made ppl realize religion was lying to them and was stealing their money and putting them in fear,  I have died three times badly, there is no hell except for those that enjoy evil and they create it for themselves, you have eternal life if you understand what jesus taught with your heart and soul,, hell was created by evil to control you, your soul is powered by god and is light, light dances in the fire, god is love and the source of all life, thats why evil wants you fearing fire, god is not some dude sitting on a throne with a beard and a staff pointing a finger at you, jesus taught this, jesus didn't teach religion, he was murdered by it, and until you get heart centered and connect to your soul before using your mind, and understand this, you will always only serve ego and those dark whispers in your own dark mind, light is information and darkness lack of information, the truth will set you free, free from fear, those that think any truth no matter how ugly it is, is negative, are truly only in fear of it, until you get this you will just keep repeating this over and over, also I would advise getting baptized by a minister you trust, full dunk, it will cleanse all the negative bs off you and attached to you, jesus walked for days and days just to get baptized by John, which sadly both Jesus and John were murdered shortly after by pretty much the same ones ruling earth now, oh the irony lol‚úå‚úä",

The title is misleading and appropriate. \nMy original thoughts on the video are these:  When I was younger, I was around a lot of girls. And they talked. Not just around me, but, to me. Sometimes they would get so comfortable, that they would say \"giirrl\" and instantly apologize. I would always say the same thing when they did, keep talking, I feel accepted. I never took it as an insult, or, to be belittling. It was just like having an engraved invitation to a how they think meeting.\nI'm sorry that it's so long. It's how I am when I'm drinking.

    "commentText": "All this feminist word policing does is make women look like they they are weak with fragile egos and can‚Äôt handle anything in society which is why men must tip toe around them and can‚Äôt be friends with them which is the opposite of what we want. What women should want is for men to see women as people with the same rights and dignity and deserving of respect as themselves and that we are perfectly capable and suitable to be coworkers and friends with and that it is not a big deal and doesn‚Äôt need to become a sexualized thing at all no matter how attractive either person is. People should be psychologically healthy enough to just admit to his or herself ‚Äú wow, this person is good looking. I appreciate that. Ok, back to work or whatever.‚Äù And keep that thought to themselves. But a long time ago in the Mad Men era when they found that sex sells and ran with that idea and created a snowball effect the infected all of society, everyone became so immature that they started voicing all their sexuality and sexism and other isms until no one knew how to not use their freedom of speech. ‚ÄúTell me what you really think!‚Äù So then we started fighting free speech with PC speech which is just freedom of speech with a PR Firm! And that‚Äôs what is going on here, more PC PR nonsense. I personally call everyone dude when I am in a casual context which is all the time and I know exactly when I started doing this. I am 42 now and it started long ago when I was 14 and watched ‚ÄúBill and Tedd‚Äôs Excellent Adventure‚Äù followed by their ‚ÄúBogus Journey‚Äù, and then watch ‚ÄúWayne‚Äôs World‚Äù both 1 and 2. Those were the magical years where MTV was still there for everyone playing awesome music videos that I could wake up in the morning and get ready for school listening to and go to bed after Beavis and Butthead and the headache of PC culture was nowhere, we could wear what we wanted to as long as no one looked like a stripper and no one was censoring our creativity because we were just teenagers and teenagers were expected to be weird and do some dumb stuff and we didn‚Äôt have school shootings!!! Then I graduated in 96, things got PC. Something happened to MTV. And then came the Columbine shootings. And then more PC and more shootings and then 911 and then the country descended into a chaos that rivals the Joker! Because now all I see are people wasting time and money on things that make no sense while there are actual people in real need of help right now being threatened with euthanasia because their medical care won‚Äôt cover an in home nurse and stuff like that. But we are listening to a bunch of winey girls telling people what they do and don‚Äôt want to be called? Get a tougher skin! You live in the real world!",

It's called \"Lenguaje inclusivo\" or \"Inclusive Language\", and it replaces the last letter of every gendered word, used on reference to a person, for an \"x\" or alternatively an \"e\" (they changed it, since they can't pronounce the words that end with the X).

Backstory: I am 66, a Viet Nam vet, disabled(I walk with a cane), and although I had long hair and a beard looked NOTHING like the myriad homeless folks here. I live in the liberal mecca of Eugene Oregon, as I said it is whee I grew up but I was gone for 20+ yrs and recently returned home, but back to the story. I was walking downtown early one morning(7:30 am ish), stopped and talked to a pair of local PD who patrol there then crossed the street and saw three ladies exiting a coffee/donut shop with cups in hand, I said \"Good morning beautiful ladies, I hope your have as beautiful a day as you are!\", when they were 15 ft in front of me. Within 5 seconds I ha ALL THREE i my face screaming at me about being a sexist, a misogynist, and several other things as well, I calmly stood there while they frothed at the mouth, then I felt a hand on my shoulder & the 2 offices were there, the one to my right said \"We got this, young man!\", they stepped between me & crazy ladies informed them they were yelling at a VETERAN who is obviously DISABLED and a senior citizen. Their response? \"He never said he was a VET!\"...MY response: I took off my ball-cap with the U.S.Navy Veteran  tag on it, held it in front of them , said \"It should have been self evident!\", put it back on and walked away. I didn't walk downtown for over a year because of that one incident. I saw this title and had to tell ya.",

Strange though it is that these people have not yet attacked foreign languages, they must at some point, seeing how the very structure of those languages contain male and female grammatical differences, take the fight to the barbaric hordes of.... well, the rest of the first world..... Most English terms are actually fairly ambivalent to gender, whereas other major languages have very distinct, gender-based differences in their speech, often using the male version whenever a male is present in the group, no matter whether that person is in the majority or not. As far as I can tell, these differences are not meant to subjugate females, but rather provide additional information, or simply imply additional meaning to things. Or maybe for convenience. Or maybe because the world is overrun with evil males who are trying to subjugate all females because penises are sure signs of the Devil's wicked influence. Boy, it's just so hard to figure out these days. Next time I try to communicate with an equal human being, I'll make sure to refer to some handy database that will hopefully have been constructed, informing me as to what sounds I am allowed, by my overlords, to make with my mouth.

No need for heavy details, e.g. I ask what do you drive? \"a car\"  no one says a vehicle thats black, 4 door, manual, 2015 etc, we say car so to relate and allow us all to focus on real problems lets all just say I am human, what are you? Human. Don't get smart and say homosapian, no need to, we still have slow learners that won't understand so human works wi th out offence. If someone is offended, it means they aren't human so they must be aliens... or the human race really is not that intelligent, which seems more accurate everyday. All the best humans.",

I don't feel that I can leave the house as I may be pilloried for being an obsessive homosexual so I have lost my job and my wife has left me and taken the children and will probably get the house and car - all this because I was referred to as 'Beyhive' without any regard for the damaging effects .... doesn't she realise the importance of language ???? ;)",

The only time I have been deliberately offensive is when I am returning the favor. I used to have a Great Sense Of Humor but people are slowly killing it. As it is I no longer talk to people at work. This is because I don't want the hassle. Though I was told twice this week I made people laugh after a really tuff day which making them Laugh made mine. The person in you video said we should call people in a group with Y'all which I am surprised did not offender her as Y'all is a term that was used by Southern Slave Owners? Surprise Surprise!  Oh and I did walk into a group of male friends and said hello ladies! We all laughed with one hitting me back with something I won't repeat as I am sure that it would offend. I did laugh though.",

Men are not complaining, in fact we enjoy women who are happy and accomplished. \nThe US is a failing society that will never let go of the anger and fake division to focus on real problem. All the talk about aggression by men towards women do to addressing them by \"ladies\" or \"guys\" all the while those who seem hypersensitive to any hint of aggression are the first to support the US destruction of much of the world for reasons no one can explain without lying. 20,000,000 people have been murdered around the world since WW2 by the US and none of them did anything against the US. Talk about insane misplacement of priorities. \nYou are still young so why not go someplace that does not drive everyone crazy? No good can come from it, you are not going to change it. The hypersenitive care nothing about others, and what they do to others, possibly as overcompensation for imaginary slights, they all fully support the massacures conducted by their countrym ignoring that at least half of those slaughtered were women. Where is the female solidarity they claim?",

Sure the builder may have had to much time on their hands but, it was still a joke.  \n\nAs for making Christmas less Christian... it makes perfect sense to me.  The holiday originated as a pagan celebration and MANY, MANY, MANY pagan (read as non-Christian and pre-Christian as well as contemporary modern neopagan) faiths celebrate the winter solstice.  It's not and never has been a celebration that was owned or dominated by Christianity.  As for the \"guys\" argument.  As a non gender conforming individual I say get the hell over it and just move on.  Of all the hills in this life that we need to climb... is people using \"guys\" as a generic term, really the one people wanna die on?  There is WAY more important stuff to worry about.  \n\nI also wanted to say that while I may not agree with everything you post, I do agree with some things and please keep making great videos :)\n\nOn the nature of \"dude\"... I come from California in the US... everything and everyone is dude.  It's not a gendered term and it's not even a term exclusively reserved for people.  My dogs have been dudes.  My car has been dude.  Really it can be used everywhere.\n\nBest bet for this kind of thing is to relax and if some one gets butthurt at your greeting them... stop greeting them.  Or go out of your way to greet them in the way that makes them uncomfortable because f*ck'em.  Personally I'm all for looking people strait in the eyes and saying in as comedically \"white\" possible (think Leave it to Beaver but more exaggerated) \"Praytell my hommie G!  What doth be up?\"  Yes I'm white... yes I'll do that to anyone, regardless of color.  There's no hate, only the desire to confuse people.",

    "commentText": "Hey Sydney, have you heard about this 208 statistic? I think it'd be interesting to hear your take on it!\nhttps://equalitycantwait.evoke.org\nPeople up in arms that it will and I quote \"take 208 years\" to reach \"gender equality\" in America, for a number of \"reasons\"\n\nBeing concerned about equal representation in Congress and other aspects, I can sort of understand. I mean, our very country was founded on this idea of representation- However, the goal wasn't for an \"equality of outcome\" scenario where we made up a certain % of parliament; it was because there was no real voice or say in the actions of a far away government. \n\nThese are also the same people who are championing men (or anyone they classified as not women in their statistics, I should phrase it as) making up less than a third of masters degrees: \"The U.S. has achieved gender parity across all levels of the education system. Women now earn more than two-thirds of the master‚Äôs degrees and the majority of doctoral degrees.\"\n\nThere's also the fact they're recruiting comedians to help raise awareness for this shit, but between the arguments mentioned above among others, it actually caused me pain trying to pull off the mental gymnastics that would be required to have some of this make sense, that the \"stand up comedy\" angle wasn't going to make it any better. \n\nIt definitely doesn't seem like they're looking for an even 50/50 split, or anything in that particular realm of quote equality end quote. I'd love to hear your thoughts on any of the matters they're trying to bring up. Do you think any of these issues actually do have some reasonable merit? (as the vast majority of it sounds like hogwash to me, But what do I know? I'm just a straight white male nerd, a PC gamer of all things; being public enemy #1 is great!)\n\nI also wanted to stop by and say between you and Shoe0nHead, life as a \"deplorable\" has been atleast more humorous- Its helped keep me from being a crazy Flordia-man story due to sheer loss of sanity.\n\nSo, thanks for that!",

    "commentText": "I used to work in holiday daycare for elementary school aged children. One time I greeted a group of female children as \"young ladies\", and they rapidly corrected that they weren't ladies, they were girls. I was confused as to which of us was being horribly sexist or ageist. Was I being ageist by accidentally implying that only mature women are entitled to respect? Were they being ageist for the opposite reason? Was I being sexist for genderising them, or were they being sexist for genderising themselves? Then I realised that as a straight white male I was automatically at fault. Then I realised that as a male, I shouldn't be working with children at all because I'm probably a sexual abuser. And then I realised I doubly shouldn't be working with girls, because there's an epidemic of violence against women and girls (and only women and girls) committed by men and boys (and only men and boys), that is caused entirely by a lack of respect of females (any other contributing factors are meaningless).\r\nSo having come to terms with the fact that I was an ageist, sexist, genderist, female-hating  violent sexual abuser who didn't have any respect for any females, I figured I'd better quit.\r\n(Disclaimer: Everything after the second sentence is obviously a ridiculous exaggeration.)",

    "commentText": "What I want to know is the etymology of a word.  So, that is what I set out to do.  The term \"guy\" or \"guys\", in its genesis, has nothing to do with gender.  It comes from Dutch and German words meaning \"ropes\".  It is nautical in nature.  While \"guy lines\" in English are usually in reference to tents and whatnot, the origination had to with boats.  \n\nSo, when we say \"Hey Guys!\"  We could also be saying, \"Hey ropes!\"  Or, \"Hey braided pieces of hemp!\"  \n\n\nAnd perhaps that is a bit masculine, because very few women at the time were sailors, but so what?  Faggot is a term for a bundle of wood, but also refers to ONLY gay men.  We never call Lesbians faggot.  If faggot and guy are related to men it is only because men have largely been rulers and many, if not most derogatory slang will be directed towards a ruling class.  In this case, the ruling class has been mostly male.  So \"Guys\" became a male term, even though it simply meant \"ropes\".",

I can't count how many times in a group of men, another man has come along and said something like, \"OK girls, let's go\" or some similar statement in a friendly way. That would be very mild compared to the average ribbing men give each other. But you can't speak like that to a group of men until you have first earned their respect. And you don't earn respect by being a snowflake. \n\n\nPerhaps because men, have actual real problems and discrimination in life and so we just laugh at such things. Apparently actual real serious problems and discrimination is beyond the \"lived experience\" of your average feminists. \n\n\n3. \"I am powerful\" but I am such a snowflake I can't handle you saying \"hey guys\".

I called myself a 'JourneyMAN' mechanic before I became a Master, I call EVERYone 'dude, or guys' regardless of gender, I refer to the people in the House and Senate as CongressMEN and when singing for my band, I'm the FrontMAN.... trying to be politically correct by amending such things with gender specific changes not only sounds bizarre, it makes me feel like MY preferences/choices are irrelevant and less important than whomever is offended by the use of common terms, which...... offends ME!",

I try to avoid women in case they are feminists.  My message to them is don't talk to me about equality, because you clearly don't want it.\n\nAs a Brit myself, even I have no idea how a guy can be someone of grotesque appearance, unless it is a reference to Guy Fawkes.  For those who don't understand this, Guy Fawkes was part of the Gunpowder Plot to blow up Parliament on 5 November 1605 when the king was performing the State Opening, and now the failure of the plot to kill the king is remembered every year with fireworks and a bonfire to burn an effigy of Mr Fawkes on.  (Or sometimes, any other hate figure you like.)\n\nFor a parting shot, I used to manage a small team at work who came from all parts of the world.  They all hated all the PC stuff about race and how patronising it is to get special treatment as part of a minority.  So I never did in staff appraisals, we just talked over coffee about whether they did a good job, and they loved that.\n\nAnd don't talk to me about team bonding events... the best one our larger team ever did was the day was when we had a huge pile of forms to process, so my manager booked a big meeting room to get it done in, just leaving our secretary to answer the phones.  And to get more done, everyone bring food to share so we can have a quick lunch and get back down to the work.  OMG it was the best buffet ever.",

So, everyone just needs to stop letting random terms of acknowledgment affect their ability to function because they are suddenly the victim of unintended sexism that really isn't a term for with unintended sexism, but a general term as you say.  Yes, I have had ladies be offended by me referring to them as such, but most, like being called a lady.  As for girls, well, I believe if it is teenagers or someone several years younger, that it can be used, but, not so much for women of similar age.  Seriously though, we should take things the other way and use more offensive terms in an endearing way to prove a point.  Hey, jackasses how are you doing?    Language is just the spoken and written word, but the emotions and meaning behind a word can always change the purpose and even the intent behind a word.  Black people have made the n-word an endearing term.  I still don't like it and think it should just disappear from our language over time, but at least they made it into something positive from an extreme negative.  I don't know, but I guess the way to be noticed these days is to find ways to get everyone to see you as a victim of some sort and create speeches about the most unnecessary and mundane things rather than learning science, math, technology, etc.  Communication is important, but so is EQ.  These types of people that find the most mundane and inconsequential things to be offensive fail to in their emotional intelligence and are wasting everyone's time and energy on something stupid.  Books should be read to learn to better ourselves and understand the world around us better, not find ways to pick apart every little thing others say and do.",

If anyone questions the child's \"choice\" it can be considered violence and ( in Canada ) is ( literally ) a crime.\n\nProblem solved....",

Here's why: around second to fourth grades kids are really starting to grasp that there are differences, physical and cultural, between the sexes and genders. Because this information is taking root it's at those ages that it really starts to become important to kids that gender is seen as part of their identity. In other words, elementary school girls do feel underepresented and offended when referred to as \"guys\".\nBut, yeah, after age 11ish people should definitely get over themselves (you know what it means, just shut up Rebecca üòë).",

    "commentText": "Women back in the 1930's were not heard? I'm sure that there are MANY husbands who disagree!\nTaking domestic violence cases out of the equation, and looking at the amiable and happy marriages that took place, yes, women were heard. It was part of a loving husband's duty to represent both his and his wife's wishes/opinions at town meetings, etc.\nThe reality is that it was logistically more difficult for women to attend these events when they were busy rearing children.\nFor example, here in Australia it is compulsory to vote. So I had to drag my 6 week old son off with me to the polling booth, a few years back. I would have GLADLY let my husband vote for me. \nAlso, when you're in the midst of raising children, it can be very easy to go a couple of days without leaving the house. That is often just part of committing to raising a family. But I don't see too many of these women with children. Too busy worrying about someone misgendering them.",

Just kill me already and bring me back as a damn Frog. No such thing as genders in Frog. They change sex to suit their environment. No sexist issues there.. Also is it just me but everything with regards to being offended to sexist yet innocent words/ greetings are only ever projected by females?? I feel like all this crap is just a cry out for attention by females just for social media purposes... If I went to my group of male friends and said 'Hey ladies!', they would not care. Because they don't give a sh*t abut anything it just goes over their heads, they just go with the flow. But looks like these days a lot women just don't want to be greeted or even talked to because everything to them is a sexist remark about their gender. How about we all just stop talking to one another and just let the human race die out. Problem f*cking solved.",

What's weird is most of the examples used in such arguments  are historical by the present generation who has never lived it. Mainly college aged girls who were born  after 1995 but bang on about gender roles from most of the 20 century which DON'T exist anymore. I personally hate the term \"guys\" as it's a shitty yanky term, it's dumb,  it's lazy and it's an informal term with little significance . And if terms are such an \"issue\" when addressing a group, then just use a single greeting such as: hello, good morning, hi. Again most of the world will just say, \"only in America \", and laugh. PS.....The term ladies is quite obsolete as many women today are hardly  ladies. Maybe they should learn some etiquette first before worrying about PC terminology.

    "commentText": "Well, that's just an open invitation to me to continue on using words such as \"actress\" instead of the once PC, all inclusive \"actor\" and of course, \"comedienne\" doesn't have to make a comeback in my speech because I have retained it in my spoken and written words, mainly just to piss off those who get offended by...ummm...all sorts of stuff.  I probably won't have much use for the word in the future though, unless, of course, Hannah Gadsby makes a sudden career change.\n\n\nAll of this gives us serial language offenders licence to revert back to using other words that the snowflake culture has tried to eradicate from our language.  \nTry these on for size:  Lioness.  Jenny ( female jackass ).  Pea hen.  Bitch.  Slut ( a multiple choice in offensiveness.)  It could mean what you think it means, but it could also mean the aforementioned bitch, especially if the slut has had a litter of pups!  It was also used to describe slovenly, untidy, dirty and generally disreputable women AND men, as in Chaucer's writing, \"Why is thy Lord so sluttish?\" https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-surprising-roots-of-the-word-slut\n\n\nI know I and many like me, will be severely taken to task over this 'misuse' of language, but I consider myself to be doing, with my words, a service to the greater community by triggering those super-sensitive little babies.  A lot of NSW and Queensland are stricken by a terrible drought and if it doesn't rain soon, things are only going to get worse.  So, I propose that we all band together and collect all of those feminists' tears and melt all of the snowflakes and, I bet, in no time flat, the flats will be pretty green...up there in Ironbark.  Then the cattle will have food and will get fat and succulent and delicious and we can kill them and barbeque them and make plans about how to offend those other serial pests.........Vegans!",

She's not offended, but clearly finds it offensive. Feminists say they want equality and to be treated equally, But then bristle at a term that basically puts them on a level field with the group. \"Don't lump us in with the men. We want special treatment.\"\n\nI laughed at her little, \"I am powerful\" nonsense. You can't be too powerful if you get uptight over a common term and think how you're greeted has a direct impact on your \"power\" or influence. If someone walked into a room and did call everyone a lady, it wouldn't change how I see myself, nor influence how I impact the group dynamic.\n\nYes...the video is insane.",

Sometimes, popular language adopts the masculine for all, while at other times it adopts the feminine for all.\n\n\nThe West does not have a patriarchal society, like Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern nations. In the West, males have traditionally been dominant in some fields because they did the work. After all, it was males who developed automobiles, invented airplanes, harnessed electricity, built roads, constructed bridges, erected buildings, invented Google/Facebook/Twitter/Uber/YouTube/Amazon, etc.\n\n\nIn spite of this, men have not denied women the results of their discoveries and their inventions. However, if women want to be recognized for more, then they should do more.",

        "commentText": "@MNTribeFan            In the United States, females comprise 50.8% of the total population while males comprise 49.2%, making females the majority - https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/LFE046217 . In addition, women gained the universal right to vote in the U.S. in 1920. If more women wanted more female politicians then they could easily vote for them.\n\n\nIn the U.S., voting is easy and free. Males have no special privileges when voting as compared to females. Males and females vote on the same days, in the same locations, and in the same manner.\n\n\nIt seems that there are more male politicians than female politicians because many women want it this way. If women want more female representation, then they could just push the buttons for fellow women on election day.\n\n\nConcerning finance, women are the majority in college; females comprise more than 56% of all college students in the U.S. - https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/08/why-men-are-the-new-college-minority/536103/ . If more women were interested in the world of finance, they could major in finance or business in college and then apply for these jobs in greater numbers.\n\n\nIf more women wanted to be politicians, stock brokers, pilots, truck drivers, plumbers, and electricians, then they have the freedom to choose these occupations. Conversely, if more men wanted to be nurses, nurse's assistants, child care workers, and kindergarten teachers, then they have the freedom to choose these occupations.\n\n\nCurrently, there are sex-based differences in desire to do certain things, whether they be employment-based on just hobby-based. This is not discrimination, but individual choice. That is, there is equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcome.\n\n\nAs evidenced by the larger female population in general, with the right to vote, and the larger female population in college, women are not being discriminated against. Many women may be making different choices than what you want them to make, but this is freedom.\n\n\nMany women have taken the motto, \"Work smarter, not harder,\" to heart and made choices to benefit them. For example, instead of many women expending the time, effort, and stress that are involved in becoming a stock broker and working this job every work day, they have married a stock broker and reaped the rewards without all of the hard work.\n\n\nWomen influence 83% of all consumer spending in the U.S. - http://www.genderleadershipgroup.com/the-inclusionary-leadership-blog/210 , even though females do not earn 83% of total incomes. If women were at a disadvantage, how would this be possible?",

I just wanted to add, that although a (german) word may have a specific gender gammaticaly, that doesn`t mean that it just adresses this specific gender and that there is (or at least very well can be) a difference between the grammatic gender and the gender of the persons included. This often gets ignored in the discussions (by misunderstanding or on purpose). I was not trying to correct you, you are perfectly right. Again, sorry for not being clear :)",

For example the Greek word for sheep is grammatically neuter but that does not mean there are no male or female sheep.  \"Gender\" has been hijacked from its original use in order for some with an agenda to hoodwink people into believing they are guilty of something which they are not.  \"Man\" in the English language can refer to either human beings in general or to a male in particular; the usage is determined by the context.  Of course, determining context might actually require some people to use their head for something other than an ornament sitting on their shoulders.",

If someone walks in and says ladies and gentlemen, it's not weird, because they're equivalent.  As for girls.....I'm 30 years old, I dont appreciate being called a girl in a professional environment.  Just like a 30 year old man would find his boss calling him a boy offensive.

Liberalism itself does not empower people, but it sure as hell liberates one from tradition and rules and constraints. Conservative and tradition actually gives meaning and purpose, and identity, it fills people while liberalism empties people of their culture, identity, and also burden or responsibilities. In yin yang, conservative/rightwing would be filling black, while liberalism/leftwing would be the white void which empties the mind to be open to outside ideas. The problem is today's liberalism has not only emptied itself but holds onto extremely few toxic and self/destructive ideas and behavior. Every damn day this is being proven by the sole fact that majority of the violence , verbal and physical (outside of private setting) has been influenced by the left.",

    "commentText": "The idea of a male term being used to address a group of \"carbon-based life forms of the homo-sapien species\" actually has been around in language for centuries - if not, millennia. \n\nI took 5 years of Latin, and one of the first grammar rules I learned was about gender. You wanna know how it works? You refer to women as feminine nouns, males as masculine nouns, and groups of both as neuter nou..OH WAIT, you actually refer to groups of mixed genders as masculine. I'm not sure that this is in and of itself inherently sexist at all. In fact, I believe it's an exaggeration and over analyzation. At the end of the day, what makes your best friend your bestie? Is it the fact that he or she doesn't offend you? Or rather, is it the fact that he or she has your best intentions in mind regardless of any accidentally offensive things they may say. \n\nTwo things to note off of that: \n\nFirst, language is simply a verbal expression of our own feelings, which means it is A) highly subjective and B) highly interpretable. The language context is exemplified by tone, body language, and attitude. Second, in human interactions, trusting the other's intentions and heart is key to growing any relationship. If you're offended by the words a person chose without realizing that they meant absolutely no harm and was just trying to verbalize feelings (and may have made a mistake, we're all human....or are we?? jk). You might as well get offended because someone wrote your name with a heart on the sand..because sand is coarse and rough..and gets everywhere - all the while ignoring that it's a heart and the intentions are pure. \n\nAnyways, that's my 2 cents..err, 2 dollars",

I swear these leftists are the zombies of the apocalypse from revelations lol!\n\nEver heard a leftist say I am sorry, I had my head up my ass cause I believed the TV and The Internet, I should of did my own research, and made sure I got the truth using my heart and soul, before I used my emotions and ego? Odds are you probably never will, they would rather serve evil without even knowing it, and play right along out of sheer fear and ignorance, all because some religion told them if they sin they will burn in eternal fire, they would rather believe after death nothing happens or serve their ego or believe they are a god, instead of just reading what jesus taught, he was even correcting religion as child, that's why they murdered him, because what he taught made sense and made ppl realize religion was lying to them and was stealing their money and putting them in fear,  I have died three times badly, there is no hell except for those that enjoy evil and they create it for themselves, you have eternal life if you understand what jesus taught with your heart and soul,, hell was created by evil to control you, your soul is powered by god and is light, light dances in the fire, god is love and the source of all life, thats why evil wants you fearing fire, god is not some dude sitting on a throne with a beard and a staff pointing a finger at you, jesus taught this, jesus didn't teach religion, he was murdered by it, and until you get heart centered and connect to your soul before using your mind, and understand this, you will always only serve ego and those dark whispers in your own dark mind, light is information and darkness lack of information, the truth will set you free, free from fear, those that think any truth no matter how ugly it is, is negative, are truly only in fear of it, until you get this you will just keep repeating this over and over, also I would advise getting baptized by a minister you trust, full dunk, it will cleanse all the negative bs off you and attached to you, jesus walked for days and days just to get baptized by John, which sadly both Jesus and John were murdered shortly after by pretty much the same ones ruling earth now, oh the irony lol‚úå‚úä",

Hence the brainwashing. And, to keep the fires burning. You must continually reinforce, the message of victimhood and disadvantage! PS. If you replace the word, patriarchy. Which is, the standard feminist default word, with the word men. You get closer to the truth! Because, (Although some dont hide it.) However, even today, generally, the movement, still can't quite, come out and brazenly say. \"let's tear down men!\" (\"And maleness\"). That would be too obvious!

We don't even know the true date of Christ birth. It's never mentioned throughout the Bible. It is guessed it to be some time much earlier then the winter months, more likely September or October as there were still shepherds out in the wild guarding their sheep. Christmas is a pagan solstice celebration  dressed as Christian holiday. So,  they can't actually make something less \" Christian \" if it never had anything to do with true Christianity to begin with. Same goes for all the rest man made pagan holidays.",

This \"guys\" argument is just as flawed today as it was 35 years ago when I first heard it in university. It reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of etymology, and is akin to the \"newspeak\" habit of genderizing language regardless of the roots of the words. Another good (failed) example of doing this is using \"herstory\" in place of \"history\" ‚Äî a word that has absolutely nothing to do with gender. Message to the language police: most English words have roots in other languages, or are sometimes even directly borrowed from another language. A word you think is gender-based (other than obvious gender pronouns) almost certainly isn't. The next time you see (probably a feminist) try to turn etymology on its ear, find out how many languages they speak. I'll wager they only speak one.",

I don't know all the trans names for everything under the sun, AND I don't CARE, If it looks Female, i'll call it female and if it looks male i would call it male, If you have a room of mixed sexes I'd say \"Good Morning Everyone\", and be done with it.",

No it isn't!\nAnd if you want to be super pissy about it you could simply cut it down to Latin or call it Latinus (which is non gender based in latin)\n\nWhat this girl is advocating is that we as a society should put more weight on words and give them more power (even though she's trying to also claim that they shouldn't have more power).\nWords are words and they shouldn't have so much power.\nThey should be easily sidestepped or ignored if you do not like the words.\nIt is really that simple.\nWe should grow to become more resilient to words, not fear them more.\n\nAlso, Sydney, it would hilarious if your middle name started with a J.",

I have not been lately, but it was getting like this  to some degree when I was there.I was  in the Army stationed in Germany and a few more places.  A lot of the German guys in their Army we worked with were totally spoiled weak soy boys,  real tall and lean but total wusses. Being gay was very common and normal there.  You could go to  a skating rink, or a club, and see lots of women skating together with their arms  around each other or dancing together..You know how when people dance sometimes someone cuts in to dance, usually a man cutting in to dance with a hot chick, sometimes a gal cuts in to dance with a  man, etc.. Not in Germany. I have seen women cut in to dance with other women, when they had a strong clean cut  jock type US soldier they could be with.. but no, the chick wanted the other chick!  Most of the single gals I met there had no sense of romance, they were cold and stiff.  They either were not interested or they would  take you home to have sex as if it meant  absolutely nothing like   renting a movie or something.. I met a couple German chicks that were very American influenced and they were a lot better, more fun and  regular. This was  between 10-15 years ago, I was over there for  almost 5 years, in  3 different places. . Just recently an older normal  old school straight  couple that lives near me  went to England for vacation.. I asked them how it was.. the first thing the wife said was.. \"I saw a lot of men that looked and acted  like women, and a lot of  women that looked and acted like men, we wont be going back there\"  She   definitely was not saying it as if  she thought it was a good thing, that is for sure! That was her first and basically only comment about it, so  it must have been a strong bad impression.   The soy must be strong there now!",

If I was in charge no one would be allowed to have a child until every orphanage was emptied and those children were adopted. That said with the way females are these days(yes i know men do it too and I don't accept it and not because of some religious reasons either) but with the way females are I refuse to give them the time of day. they've been touched by other guys and sleep around. Not my cup of tea. They have a history and I don't want them because of it. If that makes me an asshole or whatever then cool, I don't care.",

    "commentText": "I guess I'm learning that language is all about perception and less about intent. And, as a consequence, I have been offending women (some women) all of my life. Being 3/4 of a century old, my formative years were very gender specific (guys were guys and girls were girls) and we didn't mix the terms because it just wasn't accurate to do so. But, as feminism grew in stature among us, we were cautioned that we couldn't use terms like girls, or gals, or ladies because they were offensive. So, what were the approved terms of greeting for women? Nobody really knew and terms like \"guys\" became quasi-acceptable because we didn't have an alternative word. (Note: Until recently, I didn't know what cisgender referred to. Much to my surprise, I was one.) But, due to my age, I have never referred to a mixed group of men and women as \"guys\" because, despite dictionary secondary references to \"person\" , it just doesn't feel right to me. So, if I must greet a mixed group of XX and XY humans, I merely say hello (or some other greeting) and avoid using any colloquial reference to their collective gender identities. This may be more formal, but it works for me.  Keep up the good work. I enjoy your channel.",

    "commentText": "Here's an easy one to debunk. The gender wage gap in the Medical Field. And I am sure this applies to 99.999% of all job and career fields out there. For one. The BLS reports that, pay very close attention here, when it comes to \"Medical and Health Services Management\", that is a mouth full and can be confusing, \"Medical and Health Services Management\", women make only a mere \"77.0% of the 'median' weekly earnings of men\". Let's break this down. Shall we? Okay. So. When it comes to the term \"Medical and Health Services Management\". This includes ALL \"MANAGEMENT\" keyword. An RN (Registered Nurse) is not typically going to be paid the same as a PhD (Doctorate of Philosophy). A PhD takes anywhere between 4 to even 12 more years of study, and the presentation of your own theory, hypothesis, research, etc. You must put in a lot more money, a lot more time, and a lot more intelligence to get a PhD. A RN on the other hand only requires 4 years of College. This is at the Bachelor's Level. So, the normal time span to get a Bachelor's Degree is 4 years. To get a Master's, the next step up, takes 6 to 8 years. To get a Doctorate or PhD, it can take a total anywhere from 8 to 16 years, or more! It all depends on the person, their intelligence level, how much time they have to put into it versus work time, and financial standing. As of now, roughly 91% of nurses are female. As of now, only roughly 33% of Physicians are female. You see where this is going? (It doesn't take a genius to see this.) If 91% of nurses (which are lower paid, obviously, duh) are female and 33% of Physicians are female, then it comes to say that there will be more females as RN, which are management positions, than Physicians, which are management positions as well. So, therefore, there will be a wage gap in the management department, so to speak. This is a no-brainer. So, what you are telling me, is that by putting forth more time and effort, earning a higher degree and therefore being in a better position to be paid more and be in a more responsible position than that of a female. Having more time lost at work, having earned less and gained more debt along the way. Telling me that I must forego my paycheck that I have earned, to an RN that only spent 4 years, maybe 5, if they are slow for whatever reason, so that the mythical \"Gender Wage Gap\" can be filled and equalled out. Then, you have lost your mind. Here's an idea for you idiots out there. Grow up, go to school the same amount of time, earn the same level of degrees, earn the same pay. That's it. Not hard. And quit trying to force BS down my throat! Stupid beta lunatics.\n\nRN Job Description found on Google Search:\n\nIn general, a registered¬†nurse job description includes monitoring, recording and reporting symptoms or changes in patient's conditions. ... Registered nurses also, perform diagnostic tests, supervise less skilled licensed or certified nurses, prepare patients for examination and treatment.\n\nManagement Definition \"Dictionary\":\n\nman¬∑age¬∑ment\n\n/Ààmanijm…ônt/\n\nnoun\n\n1.\n\nthe process of dealing with or controlling things or people.\n\n\"the management of elk herds\"\n\n2.\n\nARCHAIC\n\ntrickery; deceit.\n\n\"if there has been any management in the business, it has been concealed from me\"\n\nImportant part of Dictionary Definition of \"Management\" (our current use of the word in this topic):\n\nTHE PROCESS OF DEALING WITH OR CONTROLLING PEOPLE!

It's either okay for everyone to use the word, because it no longer bothers you, or it's not okay for anyone to use it. The fact is that certain parts of the black community wants to have their cake and eat it. They want to throw the word around like they have taken it back, whilst reserving the right to be horribly offended when anyone that isn't black even utters it barely within earshot jokingly between friends. Of course these people don't realise that if they stopped being bothered by it the fuckwits that use it maliciously would eventually stop using it and the word would be completely robbed of all power and could enter back into the common vernacular as the harmless thing it is; a mouth sound. It could even be used as a sign of respect for a black individual, thereby completely inverting its original meaning...now that would be taking it back.",

I'd say black on white racism is a bigger problem than white on black racism in America right now. Either the word itself is or isn't offensive. If the word itself isn't offensive, which well, clearly it isn't given that it's socially acceptable for black people to use nigger like it's confetti at a child's birthday party, then it isn't offensive for everyone. And context actually matters. Which, whoopty fucking doo, since when has it become ok to take anything out of context? But, offensive or not, it's definitely better for everyone to have the right to both offend and be offended than it is to police what people can say and think. The issue with censorship is very simple - there shouldn't be a single person on the planet that you can trust to decide what you, an adult, can and cannot hear, see, say or think. No one can be qualified for that job. Of course, one can argue that most people aren't responsible enough to handle their own rights and freedoms. That kind of train of thought leads to dystopian regimes - such as the communist regime. You can't have both censorship and freedom. If you relieve yourself of the responsibility of being offended, you're putting your personal freedom in the hands of others.",

Nothing about them is literally offensive other than the 'hateful feefees' of the 'racists' using them. Crackers on the other hand, accuses all white people of being oppressors or white slave owners by being passive aggressive and putting whites on the pedestal as 'higher beings' with narcissism who crack the whip because 'whites enjoy taking over shit with their authority complex'.\n\nAnd today blacks use the word 'nigga' which isn't even a real word, and derived from nigger just so they can have an alternative word to nigger so they can have 'some' pride and/or keep to their roots but not have to feel any shame while sharing comradarie (for lack of better wording). \n\nIt's absolutely hypocritical of blacks to claim 'nigger' is something akin to the worst word/name/label to be called when it has no meaning, and where there are far worse terms than nigger. Nigger doesn't even refer to them as slaves, not one bit. The only people who feel that way, were TAUGHT to feel that way by SJW libtards hellbent on teaching minorities to hate white people, and to teaching white people to hate white people while seething with hate and misplaced self-guilt. \n\n\nAnd then my sociology professor who's biracial claims its only okay for blacks to call each other nigger BECAUSE they're black because its THEIR thing but not when called nigger by nonblacks. \n\nTHE FUCK IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN. \n\nThe word chink could be applied to me, but to the asians who never set foot in the west, that word means NOTHING to them. If you called an African a nigger in their own country do any of them even know what that word means? And even if they did.......its horrendously illogical to EXPECT them to be offended.\n\nCulturally today, a nigger is described as someone who belongs in the slums, an uneducated and/or uncivilized troublemaker. People make fun of hillbillies, whites, and christians. ALL THE TIME. Always ridiculing their every aspect. But as soon as you use a term for blacks/hispanics, you're suddenly hitler. This is a double standard rife with lies and fake truth from a fake point of view from a fake unhinged reality by the liberal left.",

There's NO slavery, there's NO oppression, all people can vote, all people can go to school, all people can own a home, all people can own a business, all people can earn the same wage (provided they WORK for it), so where's the oppression and why am I constantly reminded of  \"slave ownership\" as if having white skin somehow implicates me for it?  I've never owned a slave nor have my parents or their parents. If the N-word is sooooo offensive then why do some black people use it AT ALL?  Nothing you have said justifies anyone uttering this word, yet we still live in a world where one group can and one group CAN'T . . . depending on the color of your skin of course, and that's the bottom line here. Ones skin color allows one group to do something another group is all but forbidden from doing.",

If it's that offensive then they shouldn't say it, EVER. So while you're accusing me of having no empathy, I've been saying all along the N-word shouldn't be used at all by anyone.

You don't take the power back by restricting its use. In restricting its use you're only tacitly admitting the word still holds all the power it once did. When a white person uses the N-word to refer to a black person it is, in large part, the black individual's decision how they interpret that. Words hold no power over us except that which we let them. It is not the white person saying the N-word that gives it its power; it's the people bothered by its use. They are the ones allowing the word to continue to have power over them. If instead the black community repurposed the word and allowed anyone to use it in reference to black people as a way of denoting respect, not disrespect, the very meaning of the word would change and in the process it would be completely robbed of any power it once held. Once it was actually robbed of that power racists would stop using it. They would have to move on to new words, which could be dismantled and repurposed in exactly the same way; effectively robbing racist fucknards of any shred of power they still hold once and for all.",

Language is fluid. It changes with the times. The N-word has held its power for far too long...and ultimately vernacular is not really down to the black community; it's down to the majority of the English speaking population in any given country. They can certainly greatly accelerate it in this specific instance...but...even if they collectively decide to fight it do you think the N-word will still mean the same thing in 1,000 years? Maybe. 10,000? Not likely. 100,000? Not fuckin' a chance. Hell, I'd even say it's beginning to lose its meaning and negative connotation already. People use it in the context of friendly banter even now; they just kinda have to tip toe around anyone who isn't in their general friend group.",

    "commentText": "Actually, guys refer to eachother as everything from babies, to kids, to jerks, to arses, to gals/girls/lasses/ladies/etc, to babies/boys/laddies/lads/guys/etc, and OCCASIONALLY as men... the ones who get all riled up don't last long in male circles because it means at least one of, if not most of or all of, the following: \n\n1. They can't take a joke...\n2. They are too serious/stressed...\n3. They are too weak/weak-minded/weak willed...\n4. They have something bigger going on...\n5. They will be the butt-end of most of the jokes...\n6. Aren't comfortable with their own sexuality and/or personally identifying traits...\n7. Don't get the jokes, think EVERYTHING is literall, etc...\n8. They are NOT socially: culpable, fluent, capable, adequate, responsive, experienced, or integrated...\n\nGuys don't necessarily pick on eachother so much as call it like it is, point out thr gaping holes, call out the elephant in the room, challenge eachother to be better (think rivalry...if your rival doesn't have the competitive edge anymore, doesn't have the drive, cannot stand their own shadow, think on their feet, take things in stride, or let things slide [i.e. skill of picking your fights] , then they won't make good rivals to compete against NOR be trustworthy to have your back when sh*t hits the proverbial fan)...\n\nif you can't wear a salmon colored shirt; call eachother by weird names, pronouns, nouns, adjectives & expletives; tell a good joke; take a joke; accept that life isn't perfectly whipped cream and pitless cherries; live life without being perpetually offended: then you will be seen as weak, be treated as such, thr herd will attempt to toughen you up, and upon success accept you back into the herd as \"one of the guys\"... however, if the herd fails to bring you around because of your character, personality, baggage, and/or innate lack of motivatione, you WILL be culled from the herd... that's how practically ALL tribal/herding mammals operate... it's how the weak fail to propagate their seed, cutting off bad genes... essentially \"nipping it at the bud\" such that only the stronger, capable, successful, willful, social, and adaptable will make it... the weak are often protected by mammals, especially canines, on journeys, during migrations, etc...but the weak do NOT get some priority for picking their mates...nor do they ger protection when being hunted... they show down the hunters, the fleeing, and the workers, so they become easy targets of outside hunters (this is the case across ALL of the animal kingdom, not just canines or mammals,  let alone just the males )...\n\nIn fact, anyone comfortable in their person doesn't get put off by this, whether intentional or not, in jest or malice...\n\nSo why is she talking about this in this Vox-ish/HuffPo-is video within a video? * Blares Theme Song from the soundtrack of the movie: 'Inception' * ...i hate this word, but \"I'm offended that she's offended that guys aren't offended by being called every name within, in-between, around, and so far out of the book it may very well be in a different library/store... such as gals/girls/ladies/chicas/etc...\" ...\n\nAnd, it seems to me as if, she WOULD be offended if she found out that guys, for the most part, simply just don't care and are NOT offended by such typical speak,  nor are most people, in general, because adults figured out LONG AGO that one must have thicker skin, lest they not make it in society...\n\nAnd seriously... let's play the logical-start-to-logical-conclusion game... by the rules of ***\"Tthe patriarchy\"*** :\n\n1. It has been used to keep women in \"their place\" (their words, not mine, lol)...\n\n2. The patriarchy keeps people from:\n2.1. Breaking free...\n2.2. Achieving enough education to be free and challenge the status quo...\n\n3. Men intentionally push/support/accept/encourage/enforce the patriarchy...\n\n4. It's so bad that women cannot see the patriarchy exists...but we can!\n\n5. Men have successfully enforced the patriarchy by subdoing women, silencing them, taking their pwr, breaking their will, and enjoying the fruits of women's labor, sacrifice, and lack of privilige...\n\nHow come feminism had been around for so long if the patriarchy subsides their voice, steal's their choice, and prevents their ability to stand up or do what they want? Women's suffrage isn't a new thing, nor is feminism... no woman alive today is old enough to have experienced a pre-suffrage state in America, let alone in Canada, New Zealand, Britain, Germany, Australia, Austria, and the Netherlands... eventually overtaking thr entire system world by 1920, starting as early as the 1880's... and they got it by going out and protesting as well as a side effect of countries learning the cost of having all of the voting population out dying in wars across the globe... note that many countries, up until this point, required one to own land to have the right to vote as modeled after Rome & Greece...\n\nHope could these women have possibly protested, found other protestors, synergized, organized, funded, orchestrated, let alone been able to gather en masse to do this if women were truly slaves in the home, living in the kitchen, the children's bedrooms, and unable to think for themselves, learn to read/write/plan/orchestrate?\n\nFeminism used to be about civil liberties... which quickly were solved... the it went to social constructs that prevented or punished loose sexual proclivity... then, upon solving that, they created or discovered a new problem to solve... like every activist organization to date, they didn't dissolve once they had successfully put themselves out of a job... no, they created more jobs...\n\nHey somehow, during this 139 year period, women weren't educated, were slaves to men, had no money, owned no land, had no rights, could not leave the house, lieu alone the kitchen, couldn't read, right, think for themselves, go to colleges/universities, learn to drive, go about the city alone, etc...\n\nThis same nonsense is like the fools who think that weapons kill people INSTEAD OF that the rerrible monsters wielding weapons commit the terrible crime of murder or those who think thr earth is flimsy and there's a huge conspiracy to manipulate ALL the telescopes, satellites, computers, internet, pictures, radio broadcasts, TV broadcasts, space museums, Gov't, etc to hide a faked moon landing (AND successful space missions)  for nearly 60 years...and to conceal that the earth is truly a flat disc/lense that had been concealed for millennia by Gov't AND religions alike...or the lizard people running the countries by vibrating their skin at such a high frequency so as to appear human kind of nonsense...\n\nMen and women have worked together, made sacrifices galore, and done so strongly and willfully knowing that the survival of the species, and at least their gene pool... but since October refuse to believe that we could have gotten this far by the entirety of the human species working in tandem to some extent (i.e. men weren't fighting women...) women cannot be trained or tamed anymore than men can... but some batsh*t crazy people truly believe that everything is forced and those that don't see it just don't know... but then why do these oh chosen ones magically have the capacity to break free and see these chains if supposedly 99% of women before them could NOT?\n\nOne word: ELITISM\n\nkeep doing the good work, and I appreciate your efforts to both remain same AND point out the insanity on the hyper-left... people like you remind the average guy who's sick of current wave feminism that women aren't the problem, just like men aren't... it's the sick and mentally disturbed people siding with the hyper-left & feminism AND the sad, losing, and given-up extremists in MGTOW who are the problem.... the the average men and average women don't need to, NOR want to, wage war against eachother...\n\n\"Make peace.......not WAR...craft!\"",

I once pointed out to a \"feminist\" that, though uncommon, women were working traditionally male professions as far back as ancient Greek/Rome, way back before any conceptualization or formalization of the feminist movement. Necessity, after all, is the greatest equalizer (after death, that is). I also highlighted that every \"revelation\" of female \"visionaries/pioneers\" are actually proof that feminism did not \"empower women solely\", but that other options were open for anyone who was motivated sufficiently to determinate their own path in life without having to surrender their personal power and agency to a collective, and that the mere existence of such \"role models\" was the very thing that modern feminism contrasts with in their messaging. I don't think I ever got an answer back from her. :P",

Never was.\nCalling women 'ladies', might connotate a certain expected behavior typically associated with the Victorian era.  You know, the time when women really was expected to keep their mouths shut, please their man, and faint all over the place due to a corset induced lack of oxygen.\nAnd calling women 'girls', might also connotate that they have not yet reached puberty.\nAll of which pales in comparison to some other so-called 'terms of endearment' such as witch, bitch, cunt, slut, or ho.\nOr we can all just grow some skin and quit being such overly sensitive pussies.",

Men are being ignored, because our word is for everyone... only women are so super special, that they get their own word and have to be specifically addressed. Because women must be acknowledged, while men can just be lumped in with anyone without care.\n\nSee how this works?

Opening a previously male-specific designation to female access. \nBut if a world view is entirely based on creating divisiveness and provoking hostility between groups of people, then this is of course unacceptable.\n\nI get the impression that feminism constantly needs to perpetuate and re-invent this Boogey Man, simply to validate its own existence. No matter how much it may limit or harm women in the process.\n\nThe way i see it: the primary objective of an ideology (any ideology) is to spread and establish as much influence/control over society as possible.\nIf i genuinly believed that i hold the One Absolute Truth, then of course i would want to convert as many people as possible. Surely i would be doing them a huge favor?\n\n\n\nPerhaps women should stop go back to only wearing dresses?\nOf course male normative garments such as pants must be diminishing their gender identity, and silencing their voices. Not to mention that keeping their tender female bits imprisoned in such stuffy, contrictive confines must be physically oppressive.\n#freethepussy\n\nThere might be a slight problem with some gender non-binary people who may feel uncomfortable with wearing dresses. But surely this can be blamed on the Patriarchy?",

But after all of this crazy PC stuff that's been happening lately I've been trying to think of what I could use instead in case someone objects to my use of guys. Humanoids was one I was thinking of and sentient beings was the other that I just couldn't think of, so thanks for helping to remind of that word!

However, in Dutch 'traveler'(tr. 'reiziger') is a male gendered noun, and there's a female variant as well(tr. 'reizigster').\n\nErgo, to include the 0.5%, they literally excluded the 51% of the population, and I'm not even counting the people who aren't travelling but are at stations working or waiting to pick somebody up. All at the cost of 50k euro's to make new recordings, money which could have been better suited to actually run trains on time....",

AT LEAST 10% of all males and 10% of all females are gay, and that's not including all the bisexuals. It's a lot more difficult to put a number on bisexuals because it's a lot easier to stay in that closet if you're attracted to the opposite sex.\n\nI don't know where Thomas Riley gets his 97% from in regard to male homosexuality, but it's blatantly false. I guess he's one of those people who don't understand how two men can be attracted to each other, and thinks only overly feminine men can be gay.",

Rather I believe that people perform evil actions out of ignorance, entitlement, or lack of self control. In the end what I believe happens is people set themselves down a misguided set of actions, never realizing or understanding where those actions will take them. Whether it is a situation in which they believe the ends justify the means like \"fighting for the greater good\", they are fighting for what they believed they have earned or otherwise believe should be theirs, failure to control their carnal or instinctual desires, or lack of information due to the beliefs or agendas of another. And as we are all human we all make mistakes, as we are very ignorant of the world around us, we perform small evils whether we realize it or not on a daily basis, usually out of ignorance, other times out of primitive desire. Thereby we are all fools, at the moment all we can do is do our best to control our desires, and respect/understand the desires of those around us whilest respecting others as the people they are.",

Though this is a case where you could say that it is easier said than done, as even though you seek to accomplish goal as we are all different and lack full knowledge of the desires, and are quick to pursue our own ambitions, it is very easy to not fully consider the cares of another or misunderstand their cares.

It's a REALLY bad joke and should have been not produced.\n  To those who aren't aware of it 2 of the basic changes appear to be #1 Women start the game with $1900 while Men only get the original $1500!!!  Passing Go each time gives Men $200 like it used to but Women get $240 now.  This is NOT a joke look it up.\n\n\n  Frankly I think Monopoly was one of, if not the most, gender neutral game around.  Yes the mascot was male but think about when it was created.  It didn't after all say that Women couldn't play or that Men got more.  There was no \"Gender Wage Gap\" AT ALL.\n  To me it seems that REAL Feminists (those wanting Equal Rights AND Responsibility) should object to the idea that Women need to get more to be equal!, all this does is infantize women saying they need a helping hand to get started, or a Handicap to compete with Men.\n\n\n  I don't know if there are any rules that BENEFIT Men more than Women, like lets say women can't use the Get Out of Jail Free card, or that they have to stay in Jail 50% more but that would make it worth it maybe.",

Seriously being butt hurt over things, that don't actually hurt you, just makes you pissed off all the time. Here is something that I think more ppl need to hear and take to heart. You can't control what others say you can only control how you react.  People flipping out because the word guys was used is laughable. Why should you expect someone to change their life (or way of speaking) when you are not willing to change your life (way of speaking) to accommodate them? What makes your wants more valid than someone else's? You have the right to not like the word guys but you do not have the right to say that I can no longer use the word guys because it offends you.",

I'm sure some hypersensitive snowflake (redundant, I know) would be offended by the term because it's a corruption/evolution of the word \"girls\", and females beyond a certain age don't like to be referred to as girls, even though their overall behavior is markedly immature.  I'm also pretty sure that they'll figure out that the term \"personhood\", as used by the SJW in the featured video, is offensive because it includes the syllable \"son\".  Maybe they'll feel (very important to feel, ya know) empowered (a term that creates a reaction in me similar to sticking ice picks in my ears) by saying \"perdaughterhood\".  Yeah, that oughta work; it gets even, in a small way, for all those millennia of \"toxic masculinity, gender oppression, and patriarchy\".",

    "commentText": "I nearly always refer to women as \"hey, bitch\". Not offensively. Believe it or not. Then they toss back a \"fuck you\" and I follow with name the time and place. Then we go along with our day. The ones that get offended with the initial \"hey, bitch\" I tend to never speak to again. If a person can't take a joke. I don't want them in my life. I grew up in a household where bitch was never an offensive term. Unless you were a guy, boy howdy do men hate being called bitch. Most women though, acknowledge they've got some inner bitch. Luckily nearly everything talked about in those \"now, whatever\" videos are fabricated. The opinions are fake, the people are paid and the fans are much fewer. They basically make videos so channels like yourself can feel relevant and fill gaps in time when you can't find an actual topic to talk about. It's just an observation. Take care",

I frankly have too many other videos to watch. I could actually be offended that someone referred to \"you guys\" of a group I was in that included women. Back in the 1970's this was referred to a \"male chauvinism\" and was shunned so bad we now have a society of comparatively weak men and arrogant pushy women. Comparatively. Now we have the reverse and the pendulum has swung back the other way in some circles.",

But then I suppose it is just too 'blokey'. Imagine those southern hillbillies injecting 'you lot' into their local vernacular. Try as you may",

If you don't want to treat others with the same respect that you think you deserve than you need to find someone who is willing to interact with others for you, ergo you could 'fight the patriarchy' by staying bare foot and in the kitchen.  That actually makes more sense than constantly making it impossible for anyone to get anything done by being a social f*ck up and not dealing with anyone else anyway.  Notice I limited who I think should shut up and get back in the kitchen only to those who are unwilling to deal with real world interaction, not all women.  I do not hate women, I just don't think it's respectful to women to refer to feminists as being one.\n\nFeminism, \"Gender is a social construct and we should deconstruct it.\"\nMe, \"feminism is a social construct and we should deconstruct it.\"",

He was just informing that you‚Äôre not even almost the only civilisation that has a big problem with this decease which is not only very infectious but also extremely difficult to treat after it has gotten into the deeper layers of your brain. This decease need to be informed about to the public from a very early age and teach the parents to be on the look out of the earliest signs of this life ruining decease. You wouldn‚Äôt believe how bad this problem is already in the EU and how helpless many people feel like when someone in your family (who you have loved whole your (or his/her) life and you don‚Äôt know what to do about it.\n\nI‚Äôm from Finland and the affects or this decease is not yet as devastating as they are in other parts of the EU, but the decease is spreading fast with the help of the MSM and just like many, this thing that people shouldn‚Äôt trust their MSM, is still quite unknown fact so people keep hurting themselves until they meet someone convincing enough who tells them that they would say anything they see written on the teleprompters. But the progress is very slow at best and our enemy keeps working against us also and sometimes I believe that the best the ‚Äùtruth side‚Äù can do is to just try to keep it not getting much worst and that doesn‚Äôt sound to me like a way to victory, not even a slow path to victory. That sounds to me just a tactic to slow them down in a hope that the time bought will be a time enough for the politically undependent to see that the way we have been on for a long time will lead to Hell. And there is no way back from hell! Still, I‚Äôm not sure the strategy is the most effective one or at least the best one even for the long run. Small nations can be wiped out very fast from the inside. üòï\n\nMuch luck with this to US because if it fails or stops protecting even the little freedom around the world, they will be also alone when the enemy starts attacking from every direction. I really don‚Äôt want it to happen...so good luck from the bottom of my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è",

    "commentText": "I have to say what words one uses in language does matter. However, one also needs to look at the history of the language and the forms that it is being used in when it is used.\nThe definition of a word is only a small part, it is the meaning behind the word that is important. The use of 'guys' is an all encompassing unit and not directed towards anyone. Humans are lazy, even in language, we use the shortest and easiest forms that we can. That's why we call all of humanity just 'man'. It is just easier, and we still use it as a non-gender term today as a verb. \"Man the units.\"\nThe is also \"duct tape\" vs \"duck tape\". A language is used to describe something and get the meaning across to another, if that objective is completed that is all that matters. Extra things are tacked on in the form of connotation, but that is only for words that are directed towards a strong meaning; like in the word anorexic which original meant to be skinny or slim but the medical meaning took over and the connotation changed the charge of the word.\n\n\nWhat I'm trying to say here is that unless the majority of the English speaking world takes it as a negative connotation or a word that shouldn't be said it is meaningless to try to change it. It doesn't matter and the fact that you're trying to change something that isn't important just means that you have to much time on your hands and should be working on something more important.",

It was already stolen and celebrated by almost every other person other than christians, and now they wanna make it less christian. How do you make the BIRTH OF CHRIST less christian?!? \n\nAlso I'm insulted by that ms. Monopoly thing. Not only is it insulting men by giving women a head start based on their gender, but it's insulting women by suggesting that they need a head start cause they aren't good enough.\n\n\nWait until people get fired for saying \"guys\" at the workplace. You can bet your money that this wouldn't go to court cause without a job the person can't fight against them for being fired for using an appropriate word at the appropriate time in the appropriate context due to this dictionary definition. This is how the Justice system works! You have everything taken from you, and yet because everything is taken from you, you don't have anything to give to get your stuff back! Isn't planet earth just fantastic?\n\n\nYou have to connect with people. Saying \"hello men and women\" is too long and not engaging. Saying hello is too short and isn't addressing the people as fellow co-workers or whatever they are. Again not engaging. Saying \"hello people\" is just dehumanizing. And \"goodmorning everyone\" is addressing them as though you are a teacher talking to a student. This is too authoritarian. And hi y'all? That's just a stupid thing to say in a workplace. You sound like a hillbilly. Removing \"guys\" from the work place or anywhere else is just a stupid idea.\n\n\n8:02 HAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA OMG! That is just pathetic!",

The guy was doing the rounds for the first aid refresher training.  At the time, we had one female in our shop, and he asked her if she would be offended if he said \"ladies and gentlemen.\"  She couldn't care less; she has to work with over a dozen dudes.  He explained that a previous session, he did his usual \"ladies and gentlemen\" to get their attention and start.  One of the young women was offended.  \"Men and women\" didn't work.  \"Individuals\" didn't work.  He said he wanted to say something offensive but opted to just move on.  Ain't nobody got time for that when he has one hour to teach and walk to the next appointment, and the class is preventing everyone from doing their jobs.",

How about we just mute every single person who uses the phrases \"Patriarchy, cisgender, heterosexual blah blah all the usual catch phrases of the intersectional feminist\" and cease allowing them to be at the adult table of conversation? Because frankly they have proven beyond doubt that they aren't adults and they aren't capable of having an adult conversation. They are nothing more than entitled brats who want to claim victim status and use that as a weapon to suppress the rights of anyone they disagree with.",

They define themselves by their gender, and want to be called lady, ma'am, miss, young lady, woman, etc. and it makes them feel confident and respected. I think that's a bunch of hooey. There's some crazy obsession to draw attention to a female's gender nonstop 24/7 in every interaction and many women want, need, and thrive on that. I don't get it. That was one of the things I loved most about transitioning to live as male - people STOPPED drawing attention to my gender. There are packs of women who want and need their gender reaffirmed in social situations for some weird reason. I have a friend who tips more at restaurants when the waitstaff uses female related language to address her. It's bizarre. Just bring me a tasty sandwich and I'll tip you well without playing games.

As a woman myself, and along with my female friends, we really don't approve the insanity displayed regularly these days and get along just fine with our male friends.

I warned him months ago about the risks, and that he should just ignore the shit out of it if it ever happened, because it's a perfectly polite and acceptable thing to do. Even I do it, it just feels good being serviceable, and men like being so in particular, so what's the point in being all bitchy about it, amirite ? They got daddy issues, I tell you.

However, I disagree with you Sydney on this one.   Just because something has become normalized, doesn't make it a good thing!     \n\nI think that calling women, Ladies, or girls, is not offensive at all, since they ARE women !   To add... Calling a group of men, Ladies, or girls, IS offensive!    As a man, I wouldn't want to be referred to as, 'Ladies,\" in a group setting.   So maybe some women don't want to be referred to as \"Guys,\" in such settings either.  \n\nAt the same time, I agree with you Sydney, in that let's not police or criticize our language.  Still, some people are overly sensitive these days.   This is what I think.",

Or as if they are referring to me as a 10 year old girl rather then my actual age. I think I feel this way because that's how they use the word girls mainly where I live. Unless it's like my mother calling me and my sister girls, well since we are her kids I don't find it uncomfortable, but idk, there was a time when my uncle called over me and my sister and he was like \"come over girls\" then he was like \"hold on, you're ladies now\". That can also be a reason I feel uncomfortable when someone who isn't my family call me \"girl\". But yeah, it's not because I'm not a girl, obviously I'm a female. It's just that where I live they refer to girls as 14 year olds or younger, once you have a quince (turn 15) you are refered to as a lady.",

YET here is a woman profiting (I‚Äôm sure) off of something as petty as picking on colloquial terms such as ‚Äúguys‚Äù. Your making a living off of echoing this fascistic politically correct list of ‚Äúnon offensive greetings for groups of people(s)‚Äù. The Left aka the language police. Aka the thought police, language is how you express thoughts and when you start policing language your a rocks throw away from policing thoughts. I‚Äôm not the type to allow my thoughts to be policed by anyone, let alone some cry baby millennial bitching about what she prefers to be called when in a group of people. If she approached me with this in everyday life I‚Äôd more then likely reply with ‚ÄúI was being polite when referring to you as ‚Äúguys‚Äù, so now I‚Äôll just refer to you as I actually see you after your commentary as ‚Äúmorons‚Äù (as i give my most devilish smile possible)‚Äù",

Sounds about as ridiculous as that woman did. These SJW's are offended at everything, even themselves. As shown when they got together and were triggered by the noise of a group, then by the speeches themselves. There is no pleasing them, so why does everything seem to follow them? Maybe because they scream and whine so much that people cave to try and get them to SHUT UP! But they never do.",

Men are losing words that used to apply to them, exclusively, while the opposite of \"guys\", \"gals\", is still exclusive to women, and this make women suffer??? Only in the minds of feminists, can something being taken from men mean that it is harming women...\n\n\nP.S. I absolutely don't care that \"guys\" and \"dudes\" have been 'appropriated', as they would say if it were happening to anyone but the 'evil' \"cisgendered straight males\". I only find it amusing how feminists and SJWs are so blind to their own obvious hypocrisy. I call most of my female friends dude as I tend to refer to any friend or person I remotely like as dude, from time to time. Less, now that I am in my 40s... I have to at least APPEAR to be more mature, even if I always, deep down, simply am\n\n\nA Dork.",

I live on the east coast where 'guys' is used differently, usually to address a group of friends. However, among all female groups I rarely hear it...more like 'hey, everyone want to go out for wings?'  There THERE, no need to address them.  I find that many utubers open their vids with 'Hi Guys' and my research finds they are usually on the west coast.  I could give examples of excellent, welcoming openings but this is getting too long.  Finally, being a life-long east coaster and yankee, I find it extremely offensive to be addressed or referred to as 'folks' unless I am in the south being addressed by a southerner. That word is theirs, and they use it well, never offensively.  It just doesn't fly north of the Mason-Dixon Line.  In business, starting a meeting with 'hello everyone, thank you for coming' is standard and offends no one.  'Guys' is an unnecessary colloquialism being exploited for people with nothing else to do.  Thanks guys...",

I have seen lots of your videos and just sort of realized that it is your sense of humor that really sets them apart from some of the other folks tackling the madness out there.  I can't believe how serious these SJW's and Feminists are and how quick they are to want to limit everyone else's behavior in extreme ways.  If you ever get a chance, look up \"Carl Segan Pale Blue Dot\".  It is basically an old school video by Segan to remind us just how small we are even though we think we are so so big.  I am cool with people thinking their life has meaning (and I believe it does) but maybe there is a point at which we are taking ourselves a little too seriously and need some perspective.",

An overwhelming majority of people are not offended by any of these terms but this is them being told they should be by a small but loud percentage of the population that currently has the floor. Their agenda, down with the patriarchy (down with anything male in our culture except when it benefits them), is slowly being recognized as the monumental overreach that it is. The more they spread this toxic dogma, the easier it is for the majority of people to realize how far they have strayed from the rational. Every example of totalitarianism historically has failed and this will be no different - we should all sincerely hope it does. Thank you.",

All this SJW crap is coming from the non-science fields and mostly the humanities.\n\nEven one of my professors a couple of years ago was talking with me about it over a couple of drinks (I'm an older student BTW and we were around the same age). He has to deal with all the beauracracy in academia and he was being quite frank with me about all the behind the scenes stuff. He was saying there is absolutely no rigor in the humanities and they NEVER have to PROVE anything like we do in STEM fields.\n\nIn the humanities fields, they get their research published simply by citing each others academic papers. In short, it is a giant circle jerk and there is really no basis to it at all. That is why all this SJW crap seems like nonsense. Because IT IS NONSENSE!\n\nIt is one of the biggest scams in academia. But because humanities fields get so many students (mainly because most students simply cannot do STEM or dont want to because it is hard as hell to succeed in it), it is all about the money. So this problem is not going away any time soon.",

It is the foundation from which life is embraced.\n\nThinking is a choice. Wishes and whims are not facts nor are they a means to discover them. Reason is our only way of grasping reality; it is our basic tool of survival. We are free to evade the effort of thinking, to reject reason, but we are not free to avoid the penalty of the abyss that we refuse to see. Faith and feelings are the darkness to reason's light. In rejecting reason, refusing to think, one embraces death.",

        "commentText": "David Salinas (I feel left out, can't tag). Also not an American, so I could be a tad hazy, but here's my understanding. \n\nThe Original founding fathers were/are largely considered conservative. The documents for the country that they set up were designed to¬†push slavery to obsolescence. \nPrior to the Federal abolishment of slavery several states had already done so (federal government was very limited, I understand this was by design. State choices and all that)\n\nThe American civil war occurred when a federal push for the abolishment of slavery was going through. The southern states separated because they didn't want to give up their slaves. The southern states at the time were controlled by the Democrats, which were the progressive wing of the time. The northern states were at the time controlled by the Republicans, which were the conservative wing of the time.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the southern states and the reunification, slavery was abolished throughout the USA.\n\nMy understanding is that historically the Conservative party pushes for individual freedom and responsibility, which does not mesh with slavery. \nMy understanding is that the Conservatives were the driving force towards ending slavery in the western world.\nWhereas the progressives were involved in such groups as the KKK and programs to try and curb African American population growth.\n\nNot sure how things are in your country, I'm an Aussie myself, but I'm generally of the opinion that the radical progressives are the worst. They've given us such wonderful examples as: Soviet Russia and Communist China (those two take all the cakes for mass deaths as I understand it) as well as Venezuela in more recent years. I'm also firmly of the opinion that despite how it's always portrayed as a far right group (on account of it being nationalist, not on the same scales we use to judge left and right toady) Nazi Germany should also be considered an example of this. Though China and Soviet Russia resulted in far more impressive death tolls as they weren't inflated by a world war.",

So now that we're getting there, suddenly failure to acknowledge gender difference is their new \"unacceptable\" \"misogynist\" caveman behavior.

I stopped celebrating Christmas over 20 years ago when I realized it was just another commercial holiday profiting the corporations and having nothing to actually do with Christ. For the majority of people that is. Let's be real, kids are waiting for SANTA and the presents he brings, parents suffer stress and financial hardships. People obsess with putting up the best decorations while other people suffer horrible depression at this time, the \"less fortunate mostly\". And I told myself THERE IS NOTHING CONCERNING CHRIST IN ANY OF THIS !!! \n\nSo maybe that's what they meant ? Anyhow, LOVE your Channel !!! You are an outstanding young lady. You always make me laugh while sharing your wonderful insight on today's issues. Thank you !!! üôè üíï",

I'm sure it's one of those surprisingly shallow \"brainstorm\" sessions where one of them spoke up, \"Hey beyhivers, why don't we do a video about how using the word \"guys\" like totally harshes our gig?\"  Then a different thoughtless nube would say, \"Yeah, and we could score extra \"progressive points\" for our weekly \"how awesome we are at hating stupid stuff\" meetings if we had a black chick on the vid.\"  I'm sure at that moment the room erupted with thunderous \"jazz hands.\"  And then some conservative like @Marissa Meleske who may have accidentally walked into the wrong room asks a simple, yet ideologically shattering question, \"Why are you still fighting for women‚Äôs rights when there‚Äôs no genders?\"  At which point a squad of been pole shaped, black-laden antifa \"soldiers\" would appear and persuade Marissa to leave the room, building, and block, through the use of violence, insults, intolerance, force, and an occasional bike lock and can of pepper spray... you know, just like their fascist idols used to accomplish their goals.   ...

You can tell that you're all these things by a very simple test: Touch your mouth. If you find teeth, then your mouth is open, which means that you're guilty.\n\n2:43 \"[...] with our elevated knowledge and inclusive perspective [...]\" \n\nExcuse me, I'm going afk to throw up. Typing that quote got to me.\n\nOK, I'm back. That's disgusting, arrogant, and egocentric. It's also exclusive to a huge number of people, many of which are vulnerable. Not everyone has gone to college. Not everyone can afford to go to college. Not everyone is that privileged. In fact, men, especially, tend not to be that privileged. I know, privilege is invisible to those who have it, but there has to be limits. This is blindingly obvious. It should be particularly obvious to anyone who claims to be on the left. Not to mention, and I'm assuming her discipline(s), someone who has studied \"intersectionalism\", which claims to be about power structures.\n\nShe's a spoiled rotten, privileged, dimwitted woman-child. She needs to work 5 years as a garbage collector janitor, construction worker, or \"fisherwoman\". Then she can talk about discrimination and \"inclusion\".\n\nIf I walked into a room with only men, I would obviously not say \"gals\". By the same token, I would probably go for \"gals\" over \"guys\", if there were only women. However, if there were 3 women and 10 men in the room, I might very well use the term \"gals\". I probably wouldn't, but that's merely because it's unusual, and therefore wouldn't immediately come to mind. However, I might, and it wouldn't feel unnatural or wrong. I seriously doubt that there would be any negative feedback -- at least not from the men in the room. If the women were feminists, I wouldn't be surprised if they complained that it singled them out, or something like that.\n\nIn the end, though, words can't hurt you. This isn't just if the intention is innocuous; it's true even if the words are intended to be hurtful. At most, they may cause you to hurt yourself, by how you interpret and process them, but, in themselves, words are completely harmless. In this case, feminists are hurting themselves with their \"elevated knowledge and inclusive perspective\".",

I look at the content of a person character and how they treat others regardless of any factors. Some of the most giving and selfless people I ever know are poor. I am flawed but in this culture war, the racial left have destroyed the comic book industry, many IP‚Äôs like Star Trek and Star Wars, video games, and so on. I am not a Democrat and I don‚Äôt hate Republicans,  AOC and the squad are the worst group of people to ever get into office. Trump is likely to be re-elected and I am okay with that, like me he‚Äôs a flawed man and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a white nationalist. I am a moderate and I believe in merit not this gender equality intersectional crap the left push down our throats. America is the greatest country on the planet and yes we have issues but I would never want socialist to take over. I was just comparing the far right and left and I am more fearful of the left taking control then any conservative politicians. Please don‚Äôt name call people because if I don‚Äôt think or feel like you do then your like the left and I a brown man have been called a racist, a bigot, homophobic and the like and I am not any of those things.

Yet more i encounter feminists more im like yep i quit dating. Course even if i didnt the whole only making 900 a month and put on disability because i was injured at a young age would likely offend their sensibilities these days so yeah lol. What drew me to my ex wife she had the same dark sense of humor i did and she was a country girl in personality. My ex was full Oglala Sioux and me and she was one of the few girls i ever met who never judged me for my disability or my income.",

The most well known of these came to be a man named Guy Fawkes, essentially the explosives expert of the group. \n\nIt later became an English tradition to burn crude wooden 'Guy' effigies on November 5th, and 'guy' came to mean a person of odd or grotesque appearance. \n\nNot having this tradition in America, 'guy' came to mean a 'fellow' or 'man'.\n\nAs Sydney mentions, it started to be used collectively for either sex in the 1930s, which is great, right? They're being inclusive. \n\nUnless you're someone who wants to rigidly ignore the new meaning a word has developed which includes women and insist it only has its original meaning of simply males, and is thus exclusive.",

If women are equal so need everything handed to them, and need to force everyone else to change to even be able to speak, who gave that right to men? No one acknowledges me as a man, no one gives me permission to speak as a man. I have the right to speak just like every other human being in this country, so I speak. Women have been speaking up and had all the same rights as men, for longer than any living woman has been alive. Yet still, women in order to be equal, still need everything handed to them, and everyone else to change. \n\n\nIt's also funny that she makes it seem like this is a new 'hip' thing. Despite the fact the 'All men are created equal' was referring to people, as all male terms are basically just general terms for people.

    "commentText": "You don't like this kind of language policing? I got a story for you, then, Sydney. In France, for a while, we had this whole debate about \"Inclusive Writing\" - Which was basically some academic people trying to hijack portions of our language to change how it works. In english, \"They\"  is gender neutral. In French, we have a version of \"He\" and \"She\" that is plural. He = Il - They (masculine) = Ils / She = Elle - They (Feminine) = Elles - Simple. So, what's the rule when there is both gender in as situation, like: \"They are going to a bar\" but it's a boy and a girl, here. Well, the masculine plural pronoun will automatically take over. So \"Ils vont dans un bar\" - Inclusive language, wants to force change the language so that this becomes incorrect and makes it so that the correct way to say it, having both pronouns everytime. So \"Il et elle vont dans un bar.\"\n\nThis is a problem for many reasons. First, it's changing years and years of basic phrasing. Second, we live in the era of \"gender is whatever the fuck you want it to be\", so what happens if we start adopting the new pronouns, too? Now, my simple phrase, becomes a paragraph. Sarcasm aside, my biggest problem is mostly. You know when sometimes, you say something that you've been saying and hearing all your life and someone corrects you like: \"Actually, that's grammatically incorrect\" ? No? Is it just a French thing? Here is an example: \"Au final\" - It means \"In the end.\" but it's also completely incorrect. Yet, everyone says it! It's extremely common, to the point where you'll hear in everything from your daily life, to documentaries, movies, music and so on. All though, some persist to correcting people, because technically: \"It isn't french.\" ...\n\nWhy am I bringing this up? It's really simple. Like many thing, a language is built and defined by those who uses it, not some kind authority and certainly not the academia, despite how butthurt it can make those people feel. You are no one to try and change how people speak their own language. When you put yourself in a position of authority, kind of like this person did, trying to tell us how we should do our own things, you're guaranteeing only one thing. That thing being a giant middle finger and basically nothing else. You want a more inclusive language? Preaching around isn't the way to do it, just speak it. People around may caught up to it... or you'll quickly realize how hard you made it, by adding unnecessary rules and over complicating your way of speaking. In any case, people hate being preached at and it's fucking astounding that in... urgh... current year, some people STILL don't understand that. It's the perfect way to not get what you want.",

And right now for me, this is what these stupid people are doing, being PC is just the easiest way to create content because there are so many people who actually believe this shit. The issue for me and you actually address it in other video is that eventually people will get tired of this shit and we'll go back to the time where women won't be allowed in men \"dominating\" areas because it's too annoying to change EVERYTHING to accommodate the minority of the population.\n\n\nBy the way, as a non-English native learning about all these PC crap makes me want to stick to Spanish, and I know a lot of people that feel like learning English is not worth the trouble anymore thanks to the new rules that keep adding to an already confusing language",

It is a word that can be used depending on the context.\nThe idea that God is a Man somehow entered onto it, when it should be clear that Jesus lowered himself when becoming a man.  To be a man is not something to aspire to,\nbecause: \"all have sinned and come short of the glory of God\".\nOn another note, I have never won an argument with a woman, even when I was correct.

    "commentText": "So I looked up a few words from that list and hers and found this: Crew (from the mid 15th century) meant a group of soldiers sent as reinforcements.  Folks was a fun one because that's one that she listed.  Folks refers to common people or laity but may have originally come from \"host of warriors\" and guess what cohorts meant?  Yup, a company of soldiers or band of warriors, specifically one of ten units that makes up a legion.  I don't want to be referred to as part of a team, now.  How offensive!!!  Why?  While it can mean descendent, family, race, as you might guess from those words, it also refers to child-bearing.  Gosh, what am I?  A breeder? Ick.  The origin of the word camper is from the 1630's, and referred to soldiers.  Hmmm, gosh, many of these words originally seem to be military-derived, and back then, all the military were men.  The next one is the best of all.  Beyhive.  Well, I have no idea what bey is even supposed to mean these days.  I guess women have started referring to boyfriends as bey?  Well, bey is Turkish, and what did it mean?  Lord, as in title of honor in princely families. So, we'd be saying, \"Hey, all you Lords!\"  Hmmm, let's keep going.  Squad: small military unit (from the 1640's). Posse (late 13th century) means \"body of men\".  So, yes, Karen, there are implications to language and how we use it in society.  That includes knowing the etymology of words if you are going to make a video like you did, calling out language and suggesting more appropriate words.  Also, I'm offended.  I'm offended by something as horrible as \"beyhive\".  I'm offended by your obvious lack of research.  I'm offended by your idea that women were not meant to be seen just because women were typically rearing children and stayed at home, and while I won't argue that there were (and are in some circles, like in sex trafficking and magazine covers and such) improvements needed in the collective attitude towards women, you cannot say that the entry of women into the workforce en masse did a great thing for this country.  You ask any child whether he or she would rather her mother be working or be at home with him or her, and what do you think they will say?  Look at what has happened to this country, to crime, mental health, violence against women, health, etc.  You do not realize that your battle is never going to end.  There will always be something else, something terrible, something unacceptable, and it won't matter if that thing doesn't offend the majority of people and your solution does.  You are simply a tool of the devil.  Yes, I know I'm speaking to a woman who isn't going to see my comment or even care, but I'm speaking to everyone who feels as you do.  There is only one way that men will always respect women, and that's if every single one of them were operating in the power of the Holy Spirit and seeing every woman as a child of God and a princess.  But then you'll have a bigger problem, because you have all of that \"Man is the head of his wife\" stuff.  Ouch, right?  Of course, most people forget the part that men have to do, putting her needs above his own, loving her as Christ loved the church.  What did Christ do?  He died for the church, which means that men need to die to themselves and put their wives needs above their own.  Seems like they get the shorter stick in the bargain.  We just have to respect them.  Oh, that's so hard these days, yet so crucial for men.  The fact that women in the feminist movement think they can sleep around like men do and still have men respect them is ludicrous.  No man who sleeps around respects women.  He doesn't care about them.  He just wants to use them.  And do women actually respect men who sleep around?  Hmmm, I've never seen that happen, so why should we expect it in the reverse?  So maybe you should fight for something else, say fight against sex trafficking or helping stop close to 30,000 children dying every day from hunger and preventable diseases.  That would be a good start.",

It is words morons, go grab your coloring books and sit in your safe space if you need to decompress from all us bad people. TRUTH be told none of the left are worth my time when they do not truly value human life. When you get jail time for killing a turtle of bald eagle, but get encouraged to destroy a human fetus their opinions do not matter at all to me. May God have mercy on them.

What's more, is that the entirety of Jeremiah 10 basically tells you that celebrating such Pagan holidays will result in damning judgement from god (a description of a Christmas Tree is included in that which is forbidden). \n\n\nOther than that, this video was informative and your points were well-argued.",

The woman was rebuking in the waitress for calling your husband sweetie when she inquired if he needed another cuppa coffee.  She made it clear that she did not appreciate the waitress  addressing her husband as sweetie and please do not do that again.  I swear everyone in the dinner went silent from the shock of the women‚Äôs abrupt and rude out burst towards the waitress. Her husband dropped his head down and said nothing.  To add insult to injury, the woman did not leave a tip.  With their dinner finished, the left and I think all of us were relieved they left the restaurant and hopefully the state.

I, for one, sexually identify as a quadrasexual UPC Bar code. This recent gender renaissance has resulted in many poor confused people finding their true identity, and the \"Female\" gender is no longer diluted by \"sexual identity refugees\" who were forced by oppressors to designate themselves as female, against their true nature. The only true females who remain are the feminists. And with this reduction to their numbers, they are now an even more marginalized group who require proportionately stronger advocacy. \n\nThis condescending public service announcement brought to you by:\n‚Ä¢ The national coalition of unshaven women\n‚Ä¢ Virgin Margaritas with crushed Xanax on the rim\n‚Ä¢ And the Letter \"E\" (which is also incidentally a gender)",

Go to a black channel that discusses inter-racial dating that has ABW on their panel. You can tell they have no intention of working and will essentially keep their man under her thumb indefinitely. This is probably why there are so many single black women. Quite literally, no one wants to be with them. 2X the divorce rates of white/latino women? This is a telling stat. On these channels, they go on and on about \"black culture\", they're attempting to get black men on board with black pride or whatever, but in the end, their intent is to put these guys to work. Kanye said it. . .\"18 years, she got you for 18 years. . .\" It's a warning to other black men and it's 100% correct. Stats don't lie.",

The difference is like night and day. Black woman can't stand to be around us guys, is constantly blowing up his phone when we're out. . . the white women loves to hang out with us, is engaging, genuinely interested in whatever her guy is doing. This is why black men don't like black women. They're not wanting to be with a white women because she's white. . . it's because she doesn't shit on her guy. Black men 100% need to date outside their race or they'll never have a long term meaningful relationship with a woman. Stats abound that support this. It's a numbers game, also. Dating within the black race in America, you're limiting yourself to 10 out of 100 women. Out of that 10, only 1 will (maybe) stay with you and not divorce you.

I didn't pay much attention to it, as I eventually puzzled out it was referring straight people, but I figured was some nonsense term. Wasn't something people I interacted with face to face said, so I didn't give it much thought. \n\n\n     At some point I saw what it stood for typed out in comments of a video...Like wait a minute. \"Correct in Skin\" This is what you have the nerve to say because a person is hetrosexual they by default got the right by and their lives are somehow perfect. Oh I'm straight my life must be easy right? Yup roll credits as I won the game being born that way....pfft. That's a quite patronizing assessment of someone. Yet a gay or transperson somehow feels they're in wrong body they have got sleighted. I'd imagine there's gay men and women who love their bodies, and are very happy with who they are, and feel like they're in the correct skin. Seems like you're inserting something into their lives too, as may be they don't feel like victims.\n\n\n      Because no woman EVER has issues with their bodies right? ...If you think that, you've have never talked to a woman because it seems like women default not being happy about their bodies a very large % of the time. Even Marilyn Monroe thought she was fat despite how iconic she for her beauty. \n\n\n     Not all straight men feel like they are in the right skins. As a short man, I definitely don't love my body, but I try look on the upside as I'm fairly healthy, painful free and still have a full head of hair in my late 30s. Between men thinking they could kick my butt growing up, and women giving me the must be this tall to ride speech, it kinda sucks at times. I had a girl I was close friends with that I was in love with that friendzoned me specificly for that reason, she wanted a guy who was tall. That hurt more than all times I got my butt kicked put together. Somehow that's being correct in skin though?\n\n\n\n So yeah I find that be a junk term that devalues the struggles other people's experience. While I'm not going foam at the mouth if I hear it, but if we're going play language nazis about stuff will feel free I reject this nonsense label that mostly leftists use. You can go right away abolish long as we're making demands of each other.",

What if I don't WANT to have a good morning?  Are you assuming my preferences as it pertains to what mornings I like?  And \"everyONE\" suggests that we are all individuals instead of a collective.  Are you a closet alt-right ultra-conservative capitalist, because it sounds like it.\n\"Hi, y'all\" - Are you mocking me because I'm from the South?\n\"Folks\" - Now you're assuming what kind of MUSIC I like!? OMFG!!!\n\"Everybody\" - Great, now you're drawing attention to my body.  Sounds like fat-shaming to me :(\n\"Scholars\" - Implying that there are objective facts about the world and that someone could actually be ignorant of them, is the most offensive thing.\n\"Team\" and \"Campers\" - brings back painful memories of sports and camping. I can't believe you would go there!\n\"Beyhive\" - I'm not your \"bae\", stop sexually assaulting me!!! #metoo #notwokeenoughtryagain",

And those wanting to change terms that TO THEM sound male are FEMINISTS!  MAYBE we should ban FEMINISTS because they are woMEN, and they call themselves feMINists, and MIN sounds a bit like MEN!  AFTER ALL, THEY want to get rid of the word SEMEster, because THEY think it is somehow related to the word SEMEN.  IT ISN'T!  BTW Did YOU know that the \"offending\" part of semester is spelled the SAME in english, spanish, French, German, and even POLISH?  ALSO slovakian, romainian, portuguese, And EVEN HINDI(transliteration, or sound from the native devanegari).  Yeah, some VERY VERY VERY VERY  old words are similar in a lot of languages, but THIS takes the cake!  In hindi, for example, it is pronounced:  semestar, in portuguese.....SEMESTRE  in romainian  SEMESTRU.  You get the idea!  So yeah, it looks like some earlier language maybe had the term, it could even have been sanskrit, and LATIN picked it up.  In latin it is \rSEMESTER.  THEN, other languages, being based on latin, used a similar sounding word, like the spanish:  \r\nSEMESTRE!  BTW SEME apparently means something like 6 months.  semestris means a course of six months.  SO......IT MAKES SENSE!\n\n\nBut this is getting WEIRD!  In Congress, they even use the term Gentlewoman.  The female equivalent of gentleman is supposed to be, at least in the US, LADY!    Of course they over use the term LADY SO much that it has come to mean simply someone considering themselves to be a woman.  It used to mean MORE than that.  And ALSO, it used to NEVER be used for someone that mas genetically male!  Of course they have devalued the term gentleman a lot ALSO, but mostly just in congress and maybe the media.",

I also tried \"I like your mustache!\" with girls who were interested in me that I wanted to avoid. But that had some unpleasant fallout that made me return to just weird, alien greetings.\nI guess this is just how women want to interact with men now.

To be frank, I never even considered that addressing addressees (lol) as guys, since they are usually people you know and they know you as the term \"guys\" as being offensive to the female addressees. I value their opinions and thought as much as the male opinions and thought equally.\nOn a different note, I am so happy that at least one woman on this planet is as intelligent and well educated as you are. I love your slightly sarcastic commentary about feminism in this day and age so very refreshing and you hit the nail every time and speak of matter what other (male) beings would never allow themselves to be talking about in public because you have to fear the global ramifications of unintentionally offending someone or being arrested for speaking the truth or being arrested for being a male.\n...and people of all genders ask me why I don't date - duh, I could offend a female addressee by looking at her and being accused of whatever they come up with and being a male is wrong anyways.",

This kind of crap is simply the marxist left trying to get us to police our own thoughts, they want to control what we think by controlling what we say. Ever notice its not the cute girls who are feminists? Its always the once who are average looking to below, usually with some kind of slight deformity such as being 5'3 and 240lbs or having a strange looking mouth like the chick in the video. \n\nWhen girls are given special treatment and absolved of responsibility, saying hello to one when you are not tall/good looking enough for her to be attracted to you is considered sexual harassment. Even extending a verbal greeting only once is all it takes, and suddenly its harassment. I ran into that in the US military and I stopped speaking to military females unless it was mission essential that I had to converse with them. Not losing stripes over saying 'Hi' so I just wont talk to them at all. Problem solved.\n\n\nI figure if they want to be that way, I do not need girls in my life. They can find their own way to get resources that does not include leeching them from me.",

As the only male on a team of 5 females (including the manager who had it out for men), a young woman on my team made a list of things I said that she found offensive. \"Hey guys\" was on there. As was me pointing out that cuts to parental leave affect men too. As was me advocating that we hire another male for the team. As was me telling this young woman she looked nice ONE time when she got dressed up for something. I was just trying to be nice. Because she found all of this so offensive, it was deemed that I was not creating a safe work environment, and I got fired. Fuck these leftist SJWs.",

They are not feminists, they're morons with an attitude who moan about equality without realising they already have it, complaining about a so-called patriarchy that doesn't exist and then crying that once they've realised they got the equal treatment they wanted it's suddenly not enough and they want literal special treatment - which they already have in most areas already like you said, prison sentences etc., I would love to see some women get the same treatment as men in courts or better yet reverse the roles and see how they like it, yet you don't see us men standing around making idiots out of ourselves crying about it, we accept it and get on with our lives, why can't these pretenders see that and do the same thing?! üò≤\nBut I digress...\nü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí• ü§£",

I mean, it's never happened to me, but the amount of times I've seen a movie or whatever where the tough sergeant addresses a room full of manly cops with 'OK, ladies, listen up', or some such - well, it's a fair amount.

Most of the men I know (myself included) would just laugh at it and probably throw back a nice 'sir' in her direction, I honestly think most women (especially the lefty types) cannot understand how (real) men interact with one another and the world around them. Likely the use of 'guys' for general comes from the latin background, in Spanish if you're talking about a group of people you use the female pronoun only if every person in that group is female, if even one male exists in a group of a thousand people it changes to the male pronoun (I suppose you can call it patriarchy if you want, but given how easy life is now as opposed to more than about a hundred years ago, I think the patriarchy did a great job setting us up for success.)",

As in male or female. ‚ÄúMan‚Äù being used to specifically refer to the male sex apparently came later as english developed into the language it is today.\n\nalso, to anyone not in the know, Old English is a completely different language from modern english. it is not just people talking like larpers, all using ‚Äúye‚Äù and ‚Äúthou,‚Äù etc.\n\nedit: specifically the change from ‚Äúman‚Äù meaning person to meaning male happened near the end of Old English, but during the time when it was widely spoken, the term for male was ‚Äúwer,‚Äù which is where the term werewolf comes from, which of course means ‚Äúman-wolf.‚Äù",

I explained it as thus to them: certain subsets of the population in the USA view many words and phrases in same way that swear words are used -- in that they generally can only be used in an offensive way (so we have made less offensive substitutes for those words when they are needed). It is unfortunate that they have extended so far now because these perceptions, as explored in this video, honestly discourage the inclusivity that the far left (to my understanding) is trying to promote -- and probably lessen the ability for those following this philosophy to reach out and learn more about other cultures and have constructive discussions between cultural & personal differences between all of us. The journey to find the speech to not offend anyone might end up being the journey for everyone to eventually lack a coherent opinion about anything. Thanks for the awesome videos.",

It seems adding the word \"good\" to \"morning\" is forcing my opinions on someone else, instead of merely wishing them a good morning, rather than stating that it is one. However, not speaking to women pretty much seems to be safest. Since arrogant stares, pursed lips, and snyde replies to any questions I might ask in clarification to a statement they made are the likely result, I'd assume avoiding the gender at all, especially in the workplace.  In all likelihood, when dealing with such women, they will be happy at first that men won't talk to them, then upset that men wont talk to them, and then consider it rude that men won't speak to them, as well as date them, or be alone in a room with them, and start accusing men of being sexist for not speaking to them.  I want off this rock too.",

Hence, when you address them, you can say 'Hey bitches!\".  This is an inclusive term (as it applies/includes all of them) it is factually accurate, and it also acknowledges and celebrates their sex/gender.  Now, you my say to me - \"Howling Misogynist, what about male feminists?\", and I would reply, but they're not really men are they?  Then you have the 479,328,119 other gender pronouns.  Well, then the collective noun also doubles (and interchanges) as a verb which is a behavioural descriptor - and, once again inclusive (as it applies/includes all of them), it is factually accurate, and being a verb, is universal and also gender neutral.\nYou're welcome :-)",

( i think?) but then again I can not assume that someone is not offended by a rock somewhere. which proves a point that, all this is just showing to the world your mental illness and lack of a stable psychology. in layman's terms, COMMON SENSE!!! which you and others missy have redefined as insanity. Well i prefer to keep my \"insanity\" then to conform and obey without question your \"educated psychology\" for guess what we tend to live longer lives than people with your \"educated psychology\".  COMMON SENSE, question everything, if it is forbidden then question it more. or as a Friend would say \"just eat S--t and die\" to these wacko Educated psychologists.",

    "commentText": "I firmly belive the third wave feminist movement much like the whole sjw movement in general has arose due to the ease of living in the modern world. When we are struggling every day to survive we don't concern ourselves with things like this. We have evolved to live in a state of fighting to survive and when that condition is not present we become neurotic or create some sort of struggle to cope with. These people have really easy lives. Also another cause is the lack of culture in the modern world. There is a pervasive lack of cultural identity. People lack a sense of belonging, they are rejecting their country, family and culture therfore living in a world where anything can be true. They find a sense of belonging in sjw ideology and latch on to various subcultures in order to fill that void. Instead of going to church they join protests often not knowing why in their hearts they are supporting a certain idea in order to get that feeling of being together with a group or having a place and purpose. Belonging is very important for people to maintain a normal state of mind. All men and women need something to belive in but unfortunately many ideas that these lost people aspire to uphold are inherently destructive towards our inherent nature. Anything can be justified regardless if it is right or wrong.",

They always move at the side, and show some respect.  Same in the train. they keep bumping in to you.\nthats why I always put my hands up in the air, holding to something at the train, so these wackjobs cant accuse you of something. And no guys, when a purple haired woman keeps bumping at you in the train, she isnt flirting with you, she is hoping you will touch her so she can scream sexual assault. No matter how much she grinds at you, keep your hands up or turn your back towards her. I know my story sound crazy, but any swedish person from Sthlm have experienced this on the street and the train, them walking into you and pushing you on the train.",

Bottom line, these \"Karens'\"  honestly just need something to complain over and then champion so that they may feel significant. Along with ensuring that all the other \"Karens\" /  everyone doesn't forget how \"virtuous\" they are. Likely because even they themselves know, that aside from their perceived personal virtue, that their lives are completely useless. As they don't even come close to contributing anything of substance to society, aside from the countless inane immature and misconstrued understandings of what real social justice is. It would be more than safe to wager that most of these people actually have a sub-conscious gnawing pit in their gut that they aren't truly championing social justice and are rather doing the opposite.",

Sure those of us who happen to be better off than others should make an effort to help those less fortunate than ourselves, but at the same time the way these people are going about it and the 'issues' they present are completely unproductive and useless.",

    "commentText": "I think  the change of meaning of the word \"guys\" to be non gendered is a very positive thing for gender equality. When using the term it reinforces the idea that the women in the group, are actually equal members of the group, and that you can rely on them to contribute, and to have you back (that is the connotation that word has to me at least). Forcing people to use different terms, because \"guys\" supposedly offends or hurts women, starts a train of thought where I dread the thought of having to be careful with everything I say and do, and that I will have to work harder to compensate for women getting special privileges, and in general not pulling their weight. It seems extremely counter productive to campaign against a positive term that has been extended to include you. Its like if you were self taught, and joined a research team somewhere, and complained that people there used the term \"scholars\" to refer to a group of people, since you didn't feel the term included you.",

Two women (I assume mother and daughter) and two teenage boys (I assume brothers borne of the daughter).\nI said \"Hey Guys, what can I get you to drink besides these waters?\" We automatically brought tortilla chips, salsa and water to every table but I digress.\nGrandma dips into a low growl by telling me \"Don't you call us 'guys' again\". The rest of the table is immediately uncomfortable so I apologized with \"I'm sorry if you don't like the way I speak, I mean no offense; would you like to order or do you need a little more time?\".\nThey didn't need more time. I took their entire order, put it in and brought out their drink order. When I got to the table I served the drinks ladies first in a circle and then the boys finishing with the oldest son while asking \"can I get you guys anything else?\".\nGrandma goes guano. She tells me I should watch how I speak and how she will get me fired because she knows the owner. She was not to be called a \"guy\" because she didn't like it. She wanted to see a manager. \nI told her \"I will gladly get the manager for you but I will never curtail my speech in my country....that I went to war for.\" \nGrandma didn't like that but I didn't lose that shit job over her. She got a free dessert.\nHow is this an international news thing now? This is wholly regressive.",

Yes, once upon a time Christmas was about the celebration of the birth of Jesus...until commercialism took hold and made it more about making profits. I‚Äôm an atheist, but I like that there‚Äôs a day where the community celebrates something. I like that I can bring a smile to my family‚Äôs faces when i give my nieces and nephew their presents. \n\nAnd besides, Christmas is actually a pagan holiday, in the northern hemisphere would‚Äôve been the celebration of the winter solstice, in Australia it would be the Summer solstice. It wasn‚Äôt until Constantine desired that Christianity be the only religion, effectively punishing anyone who didn‚Äôt wish to conform. \n\nBottom line, the meaning of Christmas has evolved into being about family, community....and profit. More and more Australians are identifying as non religious so it makes sense to keep this major holiday, break tradition and create a new one",

In Finland it's called Joulu and it doesn't mean anything christian, coz christmas is older than the day church decided to celebrate Jesus's birthday on that day. So no, Jesus wasn't born on that day, Christmas isn't about Jesus except for christians and for most people it's about Santa Claus. I listen to Christmas carols and like the songs, visit graves, but it's not about Jesus, it's a pagan holiday. For me it's seeing people you love, relaxing, eating well and giving gifts, remembering each other.",

    "commentText": "Oh! I've seen this one, I've seen this one!\nIn Russian, there's now apparently a thing called \"feminitive\"\nSee, in Russian every noun has a gender which is expressed with a suffix, so for example a male student is called \"—Å—Ç—É–¥–µ–Ω—Ç\", female student is called \"—Å—Ç—É–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∫–∞\". However, for many words describing historically mostly male professions (or just new words like blogger) there is no feminine form, since the masculine form is usually the default one in Russian (and you still refer to that person/object in correct gender, just use the default male form of the noun). And the feminists don't like that. So now they're trying to force the creation of feminine forms for every single word describing a profession, sometimes ignoring the currently-existing option cause it's historically demeaning or used to have a different meaning. This results in some words that sound straight up awful and cringey not even for their cringeworthy origins, but just for the fact that the resulting combinations of sounds are quite awkward. I thought that since nouns are gender-neutral in English there would be no such thing in English. Boy was I wrong",

But the problem is that they won easly, not that winning was the problem. Because they won so easly , that left a lot of feminists looking for something else to fight against, so they tend to go looking for problems that are not really there in the 1st place. I mean in a case like this they can't really agree on what they should be called,but they have to stand out and make thier point.",

New subscriber from the U.S. that appreciates very much, what you're doing. üëã I've always said.. If men start marching for our issues & rights. It will be all out war from the feminist. \"It's going to take women.\" To stand up and say.. \"Enough is Enough!\" \"We want and love our masculine men, and we appreciate them.\"  So again. Thank you for that. Truth is men are walking off the marriage plantation. And if things don't change. It's going to effect even the non-feminist women that can't find a man willing to marry them. Sad but true. Men are not affriad of commitment. We have just become distrusting of women. And for good reason. We don't see a woman to marry, as a prize to win anymore. We see them as a risk of life ruin.  If you fix things on your side of the pond. Please come kick some feminist butt on ours too. God bless. And please don't #METOO me for saying hello. üòÇ",

Today, we have men with long hair and girl's names (which seems to push gender stereotypes) who are beating women in sports and setting records. They are physically beating women in women's MMA and they are taking women's scholarships and other opportunities. The Leftists, in their desire to eliminate sexism, create equality and push gender theory, have created a world where men dominate women at every level. \n\nThe whole reason \"women's\" anything was created was to make a more level playing field for women. That no longer exists. In fact, women no longer exist since there is no definition of woman than does not include men any more.

Since then, the majority of people I've heard using guys to refer to women have been women. More recently women have started calling each other bro. Personally I think its weird but it's not a big deal. If women want to call each other guy, bro, or some other terms, I don't see the issue. The real issue is with people changing our language to give themselves a sense of empowerment. They can take their mental games and stick it...well. you know.",

    "commentText": "A nice critique. When people focus on language policing in the interests of equality, it presumes that there is this idea of equality in the first place. As soon as you highlight the needs of a \"marginalised\" group, then that group assumes a special status. That then creates up an unequal paradigm. Since the social sympathy spotlight casts one party as the victim and the other as a bully/oppressor. Thus talking about equality ... is antagonistic to equality. The entire concept is bogus. Even if we lived in a world of clones, some clones would be born near active volcanoes, and others not. Some would be in horrible accidents and others not. Some would be victims of theft, crime, and circumstance, and others not. Equality ... is not a goal worth pursuing and its certainly not something you can fix with language policing. Whomever came up with the idea of equality misread early political works. Equal rights in a social contract is not the same as equality. Where does one find equality outside the headspace of the far left? I think ... nowhere. Even bacteria differ. Some survive antibiotics, and some don't. How unfair.",

Perhaps he starts a back and forth discussion. A woman would get offended. They would call the police or go to the media. When asked \"did you block/mute this person?\", their response is: \"I shouldn't have to\".

You off your alarm, stretch a bit your arms and legs, and as soon as you begin to get up... The police. A brigade. Probably a hispanic, a trans, a black, a muslim, an indian... anyway, are in your bedroom, probably watching you for at least an hour. You quite don't understand. You probably think \"hey, don't you have rights to read to some criminals?\", but they immediately ask you to not say a word, for they were called because of suspicious behaviour coming from your very house. You shrug.\n\nYou go to your living room still followed by a whole squad, prepare some toasts and, to kill time before the toasts are ready, open the door leading to your garden. You notice the squad are discussing that specific move you just made (oh my god! HE OPENED THE DOOR!) and their looks get way darker.\n\nYou go to your hanging clothes, you begin removing the clothespins two by two, putting your fresh clothes into the basket. And then... your neighbor appears. You don't notice the squad being more tense than ever, ready to probably kill you. Instead, you politely say \"good morning!\". You'd better shut the fuck up.\n\nThe neighbor points her index towards you, looking horrified. The squad jump, pound and tase you. After you wake up in your cell, you ask, confused: \"hello, someone could...?\". Two female agents open the cage and pound and tase you again.  Congratulations, you sexist piece of privileged shit. Your personal hell has begun!",

No wonder all those cringey US comedies always mentioned guys around the water cooler.  Well I'm glad we've sorted that civilizational  crisis out.  It's time to roll up our sleeves and scientifically determine, just how much Christmas may be allowed before it becomes offensive.  Eg Ho, ho instead of the more  traditional Ho, ho, ho.

No need to white knight for them :P they are MY lil heroes... they make quite the sport out of Embarrassing them and calling them out for it... It doesn't even need to be either they do at every opportunity... I'm such a proud Dad LOL.\n\n\nAs for the tard bitching about the word Guys...  my girls use the term 'Guys' so get over it LOL she claims it has a deeper meaning sent by the evils of white male patriarchy to brainwash and enslave the weak minded fools... er i mean Strong, independent, confidant women of minority because i'm pretty sure that's what she was getting at....in a room full of white men with one minority woman in here video clip!  sounds like attempted brain washing guys.... er peeps...LOL\n\n\nMs Monopoly is really good... they tested kids in groups of twos - boy/girl and set them equal jobs and then paid them in sweets giving the little girls half that of boys to teach girls that boy get unfair advantage from the females doing the experiment. so women reinforcing patriarchy NOT men... having seen the game myself it is exactly the same but the girl gets the advantages throughout the game... any parent with both male and female kids can buy this and watch their own kids fighting over inequality, bring this issue in to the homes of Normies and backfiring on feminism.. i urge everyone who knows a family with both boys and girls to go out and buy Ms Monopoly for them...

We still use Santa as the mascot for the holiday, which is definitely not an original Christian character. I see no reason why we shouldn't or couldn't appreciate the holiday from where it originated from instead of using it in the way how religion twisted it into it's own 'thing'. It makes sense to me, but I guess it's because I was raised with the knowledge of how much Christianity took from the Pagans and turned it into 'Christian Holidays', like Christmas and Easter as two examples. I hope that you all look up where Christmas originated from before Christianity and learn something new if you haven't known about this yet. ^.^",

It's almost like all the cheese they eat is destroying their brains, for example the US is full of SJW nutters who want everything their own way, people who really believe the Earth is flat, people who think the Nasa moon landings never happened, people who think owning a gun is their god given right, and that's just scratching the surface and theres way more strangeness they are guilty of.  I'm done with all this FEMINAZI bull and have started having fun triggering these nutters in my own country by deliberately hitting them with my mobility scooter when I notice them walking on the pavement on their mobile phones checking their social media account.  I'm now going to start calling everyone guy and I'm going to include dogs and cats too just to see if that triggers them even more.lol",

One even became a bit notorious after beating up a boy about twice her weight (he kinda deserved it though).

I also try to understand feminist logic (which is impossible anyway) and absolutely love what you're doing. But I have to give a little bit of credit to that woman concerning our french language. In fact, we've been taught since childhood that the masculine gender in language wins over feminin everytime. For exemple, if you want to talk about a group, you'd day \"ils\" , which is the plurial of \"il\". The masculine gender. \"elles/elle\" is the femnine gender. We  dont have any gender neutral pronouns, which leaves masculine pronouns in 1rst place. And i believe its kind of a problem, adding to that difficulties for our language..",

Here in the UK, a group of male friends will have at least one person greet the group of friends in this manner. \" Watcha girls\" or \" Hey girls\". This is used for the purpose of humour and to insinuate a reduction of maleness. The whole point of Colloquialisms is where they are founded. In this case the word Guys originates in the USA. In fact this word can be heard used in movies of the 50's by both males and females. As for the proposition that we lived in a world where women should be seen and not heard, this is merely a trope of comedy and not reality. In fact, in post war society, women were the home makers and also started to work. Even in the mid 19th century women played the more important role of running the home. This left the man of the house the freedom to earn the money required to run it. \n\nIt's a shame these millennial leftists lack a proper education, they may discover that the \" Patriarchy\" has NEVER been a thing. What we have now is the MATRIARCHY. \nOn a side note, Ms Watson, you have a male name, Shame on you. :)",

    "commentText": "The source of all this is lesbian feminism movement , which at the time wanted to demonise men and make all women lesbians. Its the hate that those lesbians (and not all lesbians) held for men, society and themselfs.\n\n\"On May 1, 1970, lesbianism became a serious issue at the ‚ÄúSecond Congress to Unite Women,‚Äù when lesbian activists such as The Radicalesbians chose this conference to educate feminists regarding the political obstacles faced by lesbians. At this event, the ‚ÄúLavender Menace‚Äù attempted to rush the stage to present lesbian issues and distributed copies of ‚ÄúThe Woman Identified Woman.‚Äù Although the lights were doused before the stage was rushed, this action led to pro-lesbian resolutions being passed at the conference‚Äôs final assembly. In 1971, the Radicalesbians disbanded.\n\nAt this time, many heterosexual feminists expressed discomfort over having sex re-injected into their feminist world, a world they believed to be outside of the androcentric relationships of sexuality. Echols argues that ‚Äú...the introduction of sex troubled many heterosexual feminists who had found in the women‚Äôs movement a welcome respite from sexuality.‚Äù Perhaps in response to heterosexual discomfort, lesbian feminists distanced themselves from the sexual aspect of lesbianism and assured feminists that lesbianism involved ‚Äúsensuality‚Äù not sexuality. Thus, Radicalesbians had to persuade feminists that lesbianism was not simply a bedroom issue, and that lesbians were not ‚Äúmale-identified ‚Äòbogeywomen‚Äô out to sexually exploit women‚Äù (Echols, 216).\n\nIn essence, lesbian feminists tried to untie lesbianism from sex so heterosexual feminists were more comfortable. But they still had to find an effective way to address the accusation that their masculinity was somehow complicit with men and patriarchy. Lesbian feminists responded by distancing themselves from stereotypes of ‚Äúmasculine roles,‚Äù maleness, and patriarchy. One way they were able to do so was by disentangling lesbian sexuality from heterosexuality and re-conceptualizing heterosexual sex as consorting with ‚Äúthe enemy‚Äù. They capitalized on dominant assumptions regarding female sexuality, including ideas of women‚Äôs romantic and nurturing sexuality versus men‚Äôs aggressive sexuality. They were then able to draw a distinction between lesbian sex and heterosexual sex, claiming that lesbian sex was ‚Äúpure as snow‚Äù since it did not involve men. For example, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the male seeks to conquer through sex while the female seeks to communicate‚Äù and ‚Äú‚Ä¶lesbians are obsessed with love and fidelity‚Äù (Echols, 218).\n\nUsing this ideology, lesbians successfully billed lesbianism as an ultimate form of feminism--a practice that did not involve men on any emotional level. In this way, heterosexual feminists were seen as inferior because of their continued association with men. Lesbians took on a ‚Äúvanguard‚Äù quality as the ‚Äútrue‚Äù bearers of feminism. As radical feminism became more associated with lesbianism, heterosexual feminists left the movement.\n\nWithin the feminist movement, lesbian feminists were often accused of elitism and arrogance, because they considered themselves the ‚Äúvanguard‚Äù of feminism. As a result of the differences between Radicalesbians and feminists, Rita Mae Brown and approximately 9 other women formed a lesbian separatist group called ‚ÄúThe Furies Collective.‚Äù The Furies became famous for their newsletter of the same name. Unlike the Radicalesbians, The Furies were not as successful in jump-starting a large-scale separatist movement - but they did ‚Äúset the terms of the debate‚Äù (Echols, 228). \"\n\nhttp://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/lesbians-20th-century/lesbian-feminism",

Every teenager here in Ireland and even over in Britain are speaking in American accents and using American words like \"guys\" and \"kids\" (for children). Address people as the child or children, guys and gals, boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen, men and women, lads and lassies etc. Keep the gendered terms, but use them correctly. Mr. and Mrs., Miss or Ms. too. Its funny how the liberal left find it offensive because it is a male gendered term and not actually because its technically the incorrect (though it can be used) use of English when addressing people. Just call a group of SJW snowflakes women \"Guys\" just to piss them off and trigger them.",

Everybody was against me because she accused me of being abusive (while she was the abusive one). I was scared everything could turn against me, I had to leave the house and I lost my job. She still was the \"victim\" and I was the \"bad one\". I am suffering like I never did in my life. I was thinking about suicide. I went to some therapists, most of them minimized the problem and some treated me like I was the guilty one. This thing deeply changed me. I asked myself: \"what if I was a girl?\". It would be different. I also asked myself: \"what if I was married or I had children?\". The answer is really sad and it makes me angry. There are a lot of cases like mine out there. Abuse comes from both sides but we pretend it's not like this. Men don't report that because they are afraid they are not believed and everything can turn against them (like in my case). Many things discriminate men, why don't we speak about that? Is that equality? Where is equality in a world where a woman can just pick up her phone and say: \"my husband abuses me!\" to send an innocent guy to jail? \nI am sick of living in a society where men are demonized. I am sick to hear how bad men are. It's like they say to me: \"you are not welcome here!\" Where is EQUALITY in all of this? Where is justice? What I see here is SEXISM against men. I am not afraid to say that I often cry when I'm alone. After this experience I will never leave my house, never get married and never have children in my life.",

Soon to be ex, claimed domestic violence against me to get a judge to force me out of our marital home and tried to take the kids so i would have no contact and prevent me from going to my church.  I fought back and got joint custody and the battle continues on.  She's getting financial support from me (child support which is income equality, not actually supporting children) and still in our home.  Furthermore, there are TONS of support groups for women who want to use the court system to remove their husbands and she's getting free or nearly free legal help to do it.  ME, i've had to spend 15K on a dead beat lawyer and had to borrow that to do it.  Meanwhile, this \"woman\" parades herself around as if she is a victim of abuse, claiming she's traumatized and cant be in the same room with me.  It's ALL crap and i know she's a narcissist and is playing mind games and lying.  Meanwhile, I'm struggling just to hold on and not go into bankruptcy.  Everything she has said is a lie or complete misrepresentation of what actually happened and yet she'd always tell me that I had the selective memory and didn't remember the truth.  No, i recall it just fine, she was just trying to gaslight me to make me doubt myself.  My only comfort comes from my kids, and my church family.  If you are religious, try getting involved with a church.  They can help you have a sense of support and grounding of something 'normal' in your life.  i would not have made it if it wasn't for the help of some very good christian friends who supports me.

I absolutely love men and would rather have men in my life than women as I just can't be bothered with the shit that many women bring to the table. I'm very happily married, have two gorgeous sons, and will fight for men and their rights always. Don't give up on one day finding a lady who will respect and adore you.

I thought I would never trust a man (or any living soul) ever again. I had PTSD and it took a whole year to feel a bit better, and about 10 years to fully accept what happened. At some point  I realised I was naive, I didn't know much about people and couldn't read the signs of who that man really was and I wasn't trained to stand up for myself or act fast in various situations. People are people, there are bad men and good men, bad women and good women. Actually, I met a lot of vicious women as well in my life. I realized I had a lot of work I needed to do with myself, as well as learn about people, to be able to recognize signs of bad behavior early on. I'm still learning, but at least I feel safer now. It's not about men or women. It's about sorts people who have inclination to certain sorts of behaviors that each one of us should learn to avoid. I really hope you will get out of it alive and well and level up, learn more about life and how you can take care of yourself. Life is not a fairy tale, there are a lot of dangers even in our very safe world. But we can all learn and become more alert, question everything, look deeper, understand more without becoming paranoid and remember to take care of ourselves.",

You‚Äôve learned life isn‚Äôt all perfect, warm and fuzzy but your never given a bigger challenge than you can bear! Now, square your shoulders and refuse to be a victim! Get back into the fray of life and succeed, you will find satisfaction in that!",

They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.\nFor this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie\" (2 Thessalonians 2:10-11)  We all need Jesus because we all do things that are right in our own eyes instead of whats right in God's eyes. We humans are by nature evil, we have to be taught to do good, otherwise we default into wickedness. \n\"The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?\"(Jeremiah 17:9)\nBut the solution is Jesus \n\"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.\"(Matthew 11:28) You should find a nice christian woman who hasn't been brainwashed by leftist ideology and has both her feet firmly on the ground because the only ideology she will care about is from the God of love.  It's sad but it appears that this is the most lost generation i have seen, though not hall have drank the adulterated koolaid, thank God for that, but those that have are way out there past Pluto in their rainbows and unicorns way of thinking.  I encourage you to not let those bad experiences rob you of joy, but use them to make you stronger and wiser. Wish you the bestüëç",

I've visited Sydney's pages, I see more anger, opinions & attitudes lurching further out into space, more disturbing points of view & more disturbing rationalisations. \n\nNow seriously, putting cameras anywhere to monitor a relationship between two people is just downright creepy! Last year I saw a MGTOW type reject suggest men secretly record all conversations in their office so they wouldn't be unfairly accused of sexual harassment. Even worse, a number of ppl (I assume men) on the thread supported his idea. \n\nSo many ppl here have lost perspective, lost touch with reality. With what's reasonable behaviour in everyday life. Now admittedly there are some scheming women out there, but FFS, you can't start recording everyone to cover your arse. Soon those same insecure, paranoid morons will be rushing to hit the play button to prove who was right in an argument. Or who did the washing up last Wednesday.\nIt has to stop. Your unreasonable fears are turning you all batshit crazy. You can't protect yourself from every obstacle in life.

You see, in the Soviet union they didn't have recorder's and video for people to show these disgusting liars and grifters for what they are. And they are as we say, and because of this. I will never hire a woman PERIOD,  as they can not even pass by an opportunity to exploit the system for their own gain. I've personally been accused of sexism and false abuse 9 different times and have been accused of so-called hate crimes three times. They all made up fake stories to cover their vile asses, at the expense of others, and I will just eliminate them out of the equation. They want or demand equality and lie, or over exaggerate,  then they can not be part of any of the equation. So if you are stupid enough to have them around, then record everything they do, since they like correcting people so much, they can be corrected. You see things can be a double-edged sword, all you have to do us jam it back in their face when they swing at you. Don't worry, none of these psycho leftists will have anything left by the time we are done, as they think the same. Even if they offer me large sums of money or contracts, I'll just cancel, and make no deal with them as I can have them screened as well. Well, since they like starving people, believe in communism etc, I'll show them what freedom of choice is and make sure none of these leftists who have for decades accused us of flare things get what they asked for. All I have to do is play cancel culture with them, throw their applications in the garbage, skim their resume, and fire them. It's that simple. None of them deserve  a job. These women who are constantly abusing men are sadistic and need to starve. Those men could be my son, or their's, and they have no decency or respect for life, honour or integrity. So they deserve nothing from me. Most of their jobs are unnecessary  anyway. We've already started the purge of disrespectful women. And when we cut off their fee shit, just like Russia, they will all come back and say \"I wasn't like that\" when they were. No more help, no more nothing, remember they are equal now.",

You do know why these gender equality fanatics were the same jumpsuits and had the same haircuts and used the pronoun \"COMRADE\" don't you? You do know that communism is equality driven state power based off propaganda that the state enforces using the oppressed and oppressor narrative and make people believe the propaganda until they think they are victims and become pathologically aggressive and hateful and even sociopathic by these constant lies of the propaganda. Feminism is based off of mainly communist propaganda repetition after repetition. Nearly everything they say is a lie but the feminists believe it and become vicious toward men. This propaganda is specifically designed to disrupt the nuclear family and separate the family so they can be dependent and controlled by the state, and the state rewards them by granting any unreasonable accusations as valid when most are not, (even judges and politicians are unaware of the indoctrination and brainwashing) this is designed to socially engineer the children and the women to become married to the state and break up the capitalist family (see planks of communism and socialist plans for America from the Frankfurt institute). The entire left is nothing but propaganda based ideology that causes ideological possession as the ideologically possessed act on this propaganda  and always falsely enforce their justification for their actions. You should really study Marxism and how vile it really is, and understand  the propaganda and how it's deployed. I'm a practicing philosopher and you have to be very strong minded to understand it and resist it. As it preys on you basic emotions or emotive appeals. They always use terms like empathy, tolerance, understandings, compassion, etc and it runs on guilt and shame attacking and using your own need to understand against you, when think with emotion the logical part of your mind shuts down.",

Out of a couple of billion? I'm in Australia, we have this thing called the GST. In Britain, it's called VAT. It's a tax on every single item or service you buy. Every one. \n\nHere, I assumed women paid taxes out of their salaries. When their investments reached a certain size? Tax. So the women who worked at the next desk to me & were paid the same rate as me were faking it? (you'd know a lot about women faking it) Their paypackets were fraudulent? They pretended to pay tax, but secretly weren't? \n\nFuck, next time I want a car or stereo, I'll just get my GF to pay for it. I'll save the 10% GST tax she doesn't pay. Wish I'd known about that years ago\n\n\nI've never denied there are real harpies out there. Conniving women with the heart of obsidian. But they're a tiny proportion of the numbers you claim. I've dated a few, then dropped them. You're a perpetual victim as the decent, caring women steer clear of you. It's only the dregs who deign to be with you, & if they con you out of some assets, good luck to them. Something should compensate them for having you grunt & sweat on top of them. Listen to your perpetual whining. You've allowed yourself to be a victim because you lack the balls to stand up for yourself.\nYou've had every betrayal, theft & humiliation coming.",

They start working later than men and retire around 45 on average, so the sum total of all women paying into the system doesn't even cover their average consumption, so in affect women pay no taxes, and only men's taxes benefit society as they barely collect any benefits. So there is the formula for you. And as a result they consume more than they pay in as a whole, so as a group they pay no taxes. Also, news incoming tax as a whole are the only taxes that benefit society in a net positive way. You can make women believe they make a difference in a fictional shell game with propaganda, but they actually do not. But they demand more and more as they are influenced by left-wing con artists to tax men more. And let's talk about healthcare consumptions as well, would you like to have that conversation??",

The average age for women to retire in the US, where many are posting comments here, is 60 years, NOT 45. The average age for Australian women is 52.8, NOT 45. \n\nYOU'RE STILL LYING.

Just say what you say, do what you do and if someone calls you something ism/phobe/offensive then just let them, it is not that it changes anything or is of relevance. Just don¬¥t change anything, as they have the problem its either they change or perish.

However saying \"Good night!\" is also offensive as the societal construct around the phrase would suggest that they were going to sleep, rather than just waking up.\nI suggest using the phrase \"Have a pleasant awakening!\" to include those people. Some might argue that werewolves were already awake before transforming, but that is irrelevant, since you aren't saying it to the human part of the werewolf, but rather the wolf part of it that has at the time assumed control over the body.'\nAnd lastly it can offend the pessimistic, nihilistic, dystopianist and other similar communities, as they expect or even want a bad morning to occur, rather than a good one.\nAs such, a universal non-offensive phrase \"You have awaken, congrats!\" is suggested, as that doesn't assume how the rest of the day is gonna go, but rather assumes that you have awoken, which is necessary for the phrase to be in use. Some have argued that the people who can't wake up may find it offensive, but we have yet to hear any complaints from them.",
