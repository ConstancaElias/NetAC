It's because of things such as this. \n\nStop spreading lies about us. Stop making us seem worse, when you don't know anything we've been through.",

Why separate things into neat little boxes when everyone has a slightly different view. I'm a gen z (2006), and honestly, I get why people say we are more conservative, but today, what does that even mean? What does it mean to be conservative, or liberal? I'm <b> lgb<b> t,<<b> /b</b</b>>> so are many if my friends, and one on my friends from <b> my o</b>ld school was very much a traditional Christian kid, we still got along and respected each other perfectly well and talked about our reasonings for our beliefs. Even when we were polar opposites, he was a white Christian teen male, who thought that unless you are a teen who is totally unprepared, or the baby has a terminal genetic disease, everyone should at least do their best to make having a baby the most viable option, whereas I am a Bisexual Trans Boy who was very much raised in a liberal agnostic household. But despite our religious and political differences we agreed to disagree and still were able to mostly get along and respect each other. Not what would you label each of us as? How about instead of candidates for president being separated into parties, and then people whose beliefs align with that party choose that candidate, how about instead all candidates are equal, third party candidates aren't erased, and everyone just plain tells the people what their beliefs are and what they think is the best course of action, and then you choose based in that. Say if Bob Shmoe is a Buddh<b> ist<b>  </b</b>>gay man who believes that people should all start planning for their future from a <b> youn</b>g age, and Jill Hill is a straight Chr<b> istian</b> woman who believes that children should have less time in school and explore more topics outside of the school environment to allow for individual growth in fields of interest. Not what party would you say those candidates are? Does it matter? They both have varied beliefs, same with everyone, so why isn't this how the system works? I'm open to criticism, but please no hate language I'm only thirteen with a very limited knowledge of these topics, I have only studied politics formally for one year, and google is hardly a reputable source, but this just makes more sense to me personally.",

Our parents taught us to be careful with money and to be kind to people. We were taught that we have to work in order to make a living but we were also raised in the regret of our parents not having their dream job and encouraging us to do the job we feel will not bore us even after 40 years or more at work. Or maybe our parents had their dream job and encouraged us to do the same. We grew up with an incredible love for family, even though the love we give sometimes doesn't pay of. We also know that in order to support our parents and maybe, maybe not the family we want to have, needs financial support because they deserve it.\nWe had our first job probably around <b> age </b>16 because we just couldn't stand the feeling of using our parents money all the time. We grew up with the awareness that saving is mandatory because economy won't grow forever. And we grew up with more diversity then many generations before us, that's why we are so liberal, because at heart we know, people are just people and there will always be a small percentage of people who do wrong things, who are immoral, misguided and manipulated, sick and Ill. But we are aware that this is always a minority and we know that if we were in their situation we wouldn't act differently. \nWe might have grown up with electronics, but we remember walkmans and cassette players and DVD players and<b>  old</b> indestructable Nokia's. \nBut we aren't experts on the internet. \nWe face problems that we couldn't even influence. The war in the near East, presidents and dictators with  no sense for diplomatic discussions. \nWe have to live wit<b> h Brexi</b>t because the elders were against the EU. We partially weren't even allowed to vote yet. \nWe have to face conspiracy theorists, fake news and alternative facts, we have to deal with people who won't vaccinate their children. \nWe love progress but we're afraid it's to late for all of us. \nAnd we realise that we have to live for ourselves and what fullfils us. \nWe are supportive of the LGBTQ+ community because we understand that two consenting humans are just humans and that they should have the same rights. \nYet we find comfort in religion because it give us a sense of peace.",

And what does homo/heterosexual mean. We are not to be put in boxes, I'm whatever I want to be.\nUs on the environment- Well, my parents screwed up with that. Let me get my recycling bags and electric cars and fix the mess that they created.\nUs on the economy- I'm going to create my own business. Watching other people wait too long or be lazy taught me to take initiative.\nSide note, people call us lazy, but I believe we are more hardworking than most generations, and we will be further along in life than any other generation when we reach adulthood because we start preparing for our futures young.\nUs on politics- Teenagers actually CARE. This is a new concept. Teen: \"Mom, when I grow up I'll vote for x because of their y policies and their z ideologies.\" Mom: faints because her child knows more than her about politics.\nMy point is, we are realistic, independent, fixers, and we are accepting. I think my favorite part about my generation is our acceptance, and that is something this video, obviously completely false, failed to highlight. And while we are fixers, we don't whine about having to fix the screwy culture left behind for us. We WANT to change it because it's in our DNA to help.",

Generation Z accepts them. We have a dark humor and outlook on the world because we have grown up where school shootings are considered 'normal'.  Millennials are 'now focused' and we are 'future focused'. We are participating in marches and making change. We are the most accepting generation wether it's from lgbtq+, trans people, or people of color we don't care. We are ALL the same. We use social media to get more informed about topics that get swept under the rug. We care about politics and what are world is becoming. We ARE going to fix your mess. We will restore the polluted oceans and Forrest's. We are the future.",

Gen z are supposed to be the people who only know tech but if you grew up before it was around or your family didnt have any of it then you remember a time before and after it. It's one of those things that I think should be smaller or more like a decade or so since if you grab 20 years worth of people and say they share similarities you're going to be wrong cause it's too broad of a group, you can't contain that many people in a box.",

They're going to be our first supports in starting anything? Millenials aren't our enemy, they're gonna be our biggest Allies",

If you don't like the way you feel, thats not on anyone els, you got to resolve your insecurities on your own, you are the one who holds yourself to it. Why dont you put down the social media accounts if it only brings sadness? Because you dont want to be alone, so you walk with a crook in your neck perhaps for the rest of your life on account of \"i want friends\".

The light which is produced by a miniscule metal device is \"absorbed\" and detected by our pupils which are stimulated by them causing a series of \"action-potential\" chemical system of communication which ultimately ends up sending these \"messages\" to the back of our brains. The Brain then interprets each image and \"flips it\" around to one that we can comprehend fully. \n\nAnd thanks to this wonderful system which is innate in each one of us (sorry<b>  blind</b> people), it has gave me the wisdom and ability to see through this video's utter bullsh*t. \n\nThis generation has lived with the internet almost all their lives. We get bored of being there all the time. For example, I, now that I am in college, I actually LOVE going out on walks by myself and simply enjoy nature. And I am currently very motivated in doing something great with my life. I am not going to sit around and whine around like millennials, I am actually going to work hard for it.\n\nhave a good day",

Digging avocado toast before it was even a thing, even though it's just like any another meal and I don't feel the urge to take pictures of it and post 'em everywhere. I'm all about equality and justice really, but the whole SJW thing and antifa lunatics are<b>  nothing</b> but pathetic. Politically, I'm center-right and almost all millennials think we'r<b> e craz</b>y nazis when they hear the word \"right\". When it comes to our differences my hope is to be able to build<b>  a comm</b>on future where everyone has their space to feel comfortable in. No special treatments but no discrimination whatsoever either - why they, the Y gen, won't see things this way beats me.",

It's not to late, STEP away from your phones, tablets, laptops and computers. Share your thoughts and experiences without worrying whether or not your going to offend someone's feelings (this is what's destroying the generation before you \"millennials\").

                    "commentText": "Dz\u00e9 Francis success is developed through hard work. I'm not claiming anything just pulling your legs. Obviously you don't take the hint. So get the stick out of your ass and stop assuming and smother your pompous opinion. Losers are the only ones that complain. You gotta be pretty unhappy with yourself to be so negative in general. I work my ass off. I put the energy out there with my work and positive out look, I, in return receive the fruits of my labor, thus is called the law of attraction. God is real to Christians, god isn't real to atheist. You are neither stupid for believing either. Anyone who thinks that are themselves stupid. So pushing your views on people and calling them stupid or need <b> mental </b>help is ignorant. People who do that are the type of people that love to hear themselves talk instead of hearing other talk. The 'I'm right because I read an article. Because my friends say so. Because it's never happend to me' people. Bruh I know sitting down watching tv for the rest of my life thinking Ima get something isn't going to get me shit. That's not how the law of attraction works. If you actually had the will power to understand the different meanings of the law of attraction then you may understand. Side note law of attraction is just like law of gravity. It's a physical law. You can say gravity isn't real that the earths flat what ever, but that comes down to perspective. You may have so called facts, but I'm sure there are facts for the opposite opinion as well. For instance god isn't real. Some have facts or evidence they've talked to him, some say they never seen or ever talked to him. Either way it's a fact to you and your self truth. I do not need<b>  mental</b> health. You can believe what you want. And if I'm saying the opposite of my original post it's because I don't take negative people in a serious light. For instance the comments above. I'm trolling him. Idc what he thinks of me. The guys a chump. Just because I say I believe in god I'm apparently an idiot. Thats just an opinion. But he wanted to force his opinion on me because if I don't believ what he believes then I must be lower then he is. If you disagree with someone doesn't mean they are idiots. We will see what happens in the after life. If your an atheist then good don't waste your time on religion. Lol don't be push your ideals on others like a chump. And also just because you are motivated and are doing something in life doesn't mean you are more successful then a poo<b> r fa</b>t man who loves what he does and if that's watching tv then so be it. There is no where in life. The only success in the world is happiness. If making money is your happiness then so be it. If relaxing all day is your happiness then so be it. The successful person is the person who lives a life without regret. A happy life. You can have millions and be unhappy. You can ha<b> ve nothi</b>ng and be happy. That is what you rate success off of my friend.",

Both have done a piss poor job, telling you your special and keeping you sheltered for two different reasons.\nAny millennial who was educated by a boomer, had to compensate for the lack of care they give there own kids, so this was transgressed on to the millennial's, but over the top.\nNow education by a gen Xer, was just the reverse reason, they didn't want to be like there parent's when it came to the next gen. So yes they told  the millennial's there special and they can be anything they want.\n\nNow, I'm a mid Gen Xer, and my parents were from the silent gen, yes a late child. I has the same experience as other gen Xers, but with the bonus of both parents being around. Lucky to have independence, problem solving skills, and advise when I really got stuck, as well as discipline.\nMy child, like myself also skipped a generation, but is being taught self reliance, along side his education, and if he's does something good, praise is given, but there is no reward for anything else. Advice yes but he is not wrapped in a blanket. Everything your gen has, he has, but its regulated. He has it on weekends only and he chooses if he wants to go out with friends, game, or chill.",

I don't care what generation you are, by calling us techno zombies (keep in mind you're using technology right now), you are in a way admitting that Gen Z is more educated than yourself. Also, if you're referring to true war, Gen Z probably wouldn't participate voluntarily. Nuclear tensions in North Korea have deescalated considerably since you posted this hate comment against a whole generation. And while there are many extremely stupid members of my generation (of that I am well aware) the same goes for any generation. And the fact that you're judging a whole generation based off of their TEENAGE years is worrying. Surely you could understand the importance of analyzing things in a fair light. It's like if I judged Gen X based off of their teenage years. I could then call all of them smokers and rebels, which now is far from the truth. Quit being a douche. Plus, I get the sneaking suspicion you yourself are a millennial, which would create an extreme bias. Edit: Also, Generation Z is considered the most open and welcoming religion, free of extreme forms of <b> racism </b>present in past generations. This same discriminatory pattern that we do not have is clearly present in you.",

When does the blame end??  Gen y just needs to know your voice and who you are without being put down. Also what would gen y gain from making this video??? Gen y isn't some evil backstabber! Every generation has something to give. Gen y is the inbetween generation to a world with social media and the years before technology. Technology is awesome and face to face is too, we need both.

Everyone has always been influenced by advertising whether it was presented to them in magazines, newspapers, billboards, tv ads, fliers, what other people are saying. How does the fact that it is now electronic make it different? I also don't understand why a lot of people who identify as a gen zeder are saying advertising has been shoved down their throat by millennials. Millennials are aged between 1981 and 1997, making the oldest millennial 36 and the youngest 20. How does a Personally I am 23 and had <b> nothing </b>to do with the advertising being shoved into your (and my own) faces. I think you'll find that the older millennials and the generation before them is responsible for developing the technology we have today. Millennials and gen z are the ones who are experiencing growing up with it first hand. Whether it is good, bad, or a bit of both, I don't know, but I am sick and fucking tired of of people blaming millennials for everything.",

They would have wished for WW2 to have taken a slightly different turn. Our once beautiful Western societies built by the blood, sweat, and tears of our fathers and mothers, destroyed before our very eyes within a few decades. I will fight and die for the West. These Orwellian Western governments have become too powerful with (((politicians))) that encourage the west's demise. We will not shut up... You cannot silence us... you cannot buy us. Our future for OUR people will be achieved through either peace or violence Our children WILL have a home away from this multicultural shithole that is Islamic Sweden... We WILL regain pride and if we have to make special camps for those unwilling to allow us to have a right to a place we call home and exist on the earth then so be it. Remember even the most civilized of men will fight to the death when cornered. If you give us no where else to go. We promise to at least take down these Orwellian political bodies like the European Union, along with the Zionist supremacists who led the west into it's demise. You WILL HANG.",

Defend Europe from the invaders. I am proud to be white. One girl in my class (you know the type lol, <b> red<b>  </b</b>>hair, five piercings, I guess they still exist) told all of us we have white privilege, no one engaged her. But I have noticed that we hide our power levels. Legit everyone in my class watches pewdiepie and jontron, i know for sure most of the guys browse that special website (taiwanese imageboard?). However I would never tell people I'm proud of being white or European because I am afraid of the backlash/doxxing as a rayciss. They talked about the school walkouts on the news, you know how many people walked out of my grade of 100 people? only 10 people. And they were all girls, and one vegan (everyone makes fun of her behind her back). \nAlso does anyone else realllllly hate hippie baby boomers? OMG I was at my teacher's 70th birthday party and her crusty as<b> s ol</b>d degenerate friends from college came up to me and my friends and started talking about how my generation was going to be the most progressive yet and how we were going to change the world. I wanted to fucking throw up. Imagine their faces.... one day. One day.\nAlso I had a millenial teacher and she was whining after the election and I was so fucking annoyed. Millenials whine about anything.",

I'm to young to have a generation z kid who'<b> s ol</b>d enough to think about changing the world. I think the generation timeline is cut to short.

Bullshit, all it did was force her to use her damn brain for a year and now shes right back where she started, without a single bit of inspiration to move, no self-initiative to change things, always begging her boss to let her keep her job even as she is the last to finish her work.

His mother and father had a few fights and divorced but still have a friendly relationship. He grew up and learned much is school, learning about things not simply what his teachers told him but his own interests as well. He does not feel a sense of national pride or any kind of equivalent emotion, he views people as individuals first and foremost, and feels like people like Trump and Clinton among others are not worth voting for not because of media or anything else, but because they do not want to solve problems, he wants to look into renewable sources of energy not because of the environmentalists, but because he knows how finite things are, he wants to look to make efficient items because he understands how limited things are. He would rather have peace and talk with others rather than fight it out because he does not want needless bloodshed, he would rather have people work alongside each other as individuals rather than be separate groups, so my question is, is he part of Gen Z? or is he something else, and if you agree with him, let me know, because that man is Me...",

The ones you should be upset with is our parents those people who where having kids in the 90s. I was a newborn around that time and grew up in the 2000s so fuck you how could I have left you anything to clean up when i was to young to vote or even make an economic impact. So I guess in my teens and early to mid 20 I left such a mess behind even though I just moved out of my parents home and I'm not even sure if I want college or what.",

However, Gen Z knows the reality of how broken our society is in the same way millenials do, both generations have the ability to be colorful individuals, be into economic and social equality, play the game (aka get a job) and participate in the same system we know is unethical, and be optimistic and realistic at the same time. We are spiritual in different ways than previous generations, while both of our generations know that science is the future. People try to act like Gen Z is very regressive, but based on my observations of both Millenials and Gen Z growing up there are the same amount of progressives and regressives in each, I used to resent my peers and compare them to to older genrrations, but as I've grown up I've realized that both are the same really.

We are creators, but that's because we live in a society that embraces both passions and work, so we have always been able to dabble in our passions. We are realistic, so we understand that we need to make money at the end of the day, but that doesn't stop us from having hobbies or pages dedicated to our passions. Plus, if you end becoming good enough, you can make a profit off of your passion as well. Even if it is a little, more money is more money. Also, to those of our generation who are social media obsessed, they can look more interesting on their pages if they do interesting things. It is just the norm to have a side hobby or passion now, if not, you just look boring. If you look at it at face value, we do interesting things to look interesting so we get more follows,likes,hearts, whatever the fuck.(obviously a generalization, in my opinion, I believe that these labels are more of a mindset than who we truly are. A person born in generation z can act like a millennial,vice a versa).",

And before you say I come from a poor school, I actually live in a rich school district. We dress up sometimes, normally Friday's, but God forbid we are not allowed to wear nice clothes every once in a while like any other generation. Plus, <b> nobody </b>really cares what you wear anymore. Look up the biggest boy band in the world, BTS and check out their clothes and hair colors. They show how fashion really doesn't have a distinct look anymore because we don't just look to our own country, we look to others as well. We are unique, casual, fancy, trashy, classy. Yes, we are on our phones all the time but so what. We get things done on it and learn more about the real world at an early<b>  age</b>. I know more about politics than my parents do sometimes because of my phone. And we suffer from an extreme amount of pressure simply because we are the next gen and are supposed to be BETTER. This happened to the gen before us and while happen to the one after us. It's just normal, but we don't crack under it. We work, care about our educations, start networking online at early ages, learn new things everyday via the Internet. And i<b> f nothin</b>g changes your mind about my generation, just remember we are 25% of the worlds population. No matter how much you hate us, or think us to be self entitled brats, we are still here. We will be a primary part of the work force, we dominate social efforts (sexuality and race's don't matter anymore; we are open and care more about personalities than skin color or who you like. I'm genuinely disgusted <b> by homophob</b>ic <b> and rac</b>ist people), we dominate social media, we are starting to be able to vote. We are becoming part of you. Disagree with us, hate us, but one day we will be the norm, and everyone else will be stuck in the past. And the cycle will repeat with my generation being stuck in the past in comparison to the newer generations. It's how the world works.",

Do you think the other generations, including millennials, didn't  say the same thing? Okay good we have technology and are better educated an shit but that doesn't mean we are the solution to everything , there is so much to fix; corruption, poverty, wars and just one \"entrepreneurial generation\" will probably not be able to fix that. Putting down all the other generations, like millennials, makes you worse than just \"whiney little bitches\", as someone so eloquently said, it makes you arrogant and as far as I know arrogance never fixed the world.",

Yet we're constantly drilled into our heads that tolerance can solve it, and that we should solve other people's problems?\n\nI'm sorry, but I've noticed a trend among much of my other generation Z friends (male ones to be exact) \u2014 we couldn't give a shit about some craphole countries. Our economy is slowly crumbling. Our prospects for getting jobs are shrinking day by day amidst globalisation and automation. We have no chance of ever being able to buy a house and no chance of ever being able to retire. Yet the Millennials want to tell us that the billion fucking non-existent genders are more important than the future.\n\nDo you know why we won't be able to retire? Well, it's because of a simple thing you can't solve via immigration \u2014 Aging population. Do you think immigrants come here to pay for your retirement? Of course not. The entire pension system was able to function on the fact that there'd be more people in the next generation than the previous. Where the fuck does that leave us who live in times where people in the West would rather bask in their own selfishness than ever have kids.\n\nOur Generation is fucked in so many ways and I don't even care which way you politically lean, because you're probably just as fucked as anyone else. The millennials constant cry about their problems instead of working to solve them, and as a knock-on effect they're just passing the<b>  buck</b> down to our generation of already over-burdened system-slaves.\n\nDoes it even matter that we're better educated? We work all our childhood up to the end of University (or just secondary Education) and then, unlike our parents told us, we'll be working from then on for the rest of our lives. We have no choice. The system has decided for us. The last two generations have decided for us.\n\nI won't be surprised if there's another major war within my lifetime, probably while I am of fightin<b> g ag</b>e as the cherry to top off all our problems.",

But the right have played along many times, and added damage of his own.\u00a0For instance,\u00a0It was the Republican Nixon, who debased the US currency from gold to <b> nothing,</b> thus enabling super-deficient spending.

What makes the internet dangerous is 1.) Solelu based on how the perceiver and the receiver of the information takes everything on the net and 2.) On how misinformations and horrendous and (misinterpreted) ideologies (by the opposition) frolick freely and par with the actual good and benefitial information. Do you know how to combat these horrible cultures you say that had been shoved on you by the people you accused of who which were had been probably been shoved by their <b> elder </b>generations? Educate yourself. You've got the whole enchilada in your hands as you say. You grew up with the internet. It's time to use it well for progress not regress. Pointing out of what you perceived as mistakes of the ones ahead of you may they be from a subjective pov or objective is one thing and it should be brought upon. But don't act as if you know everything. These horrible cultures you're tagging had always been existent and it will surely exist in your own generation for all people have their own individuality, whether they were shaped by circumstances, nurture or nature. And I'm telling you as a twenty-one year<b>  old</b> who still has to learn about everything around me, exclusion is a very wrong move and propagating for something, especially that will lead humanity to progress, SHOULD not only be effective on a certain group of people but for all. This should not actually be a certain generation vs generation but instead we should find <b> a commo</b>n ground and till on that. Connect and reconnect----that has been the purpose and somehow the good effect of the internet you grew up with, right? \n\nNow rants over. Y'all dismiss!\ud83d\ude02",

After learning that College is a Scam (the hard way) and it basically ruined my life, I felt compelled to create a video that covers options you have as a consumer when dealing with Student Loan Debt. The options you have are not limited to what I mention so I encourage you to do in-depth research and Share For Awareness!!! Thank you so much guys. If there is one way to beat the system, it's by working collaboratively and sharing the wealth of knowledge with others. Keep moving forward.

Those whiny little cry babies always trying to create some perception of evil Corporations, while simultaneously giving all their money and power over to a bunch of corrupt losers in the government. We're one of the most entrepreneurial minded generations, and not going to put ourselves in debt to get a meaningless degree. This video was Incredibly vague, trying to hard to be deep when it's not. <b> Nobody </b>uses Facebook or twitter anymore, no one is that insecure we are all pretty confident and while technology is a big part of our lives we don't see that as a. Bad thing. This video was clearly made by a millennial expecting us to be the same Whitney pussies they are. News flash, we aren't. We are the pendulum swing.

Two I feel like generation z is blaming generation y a generation that hasn't been around long enough to do anything with ourselves let alone fuck up society. If they want to blame anyone, they can blame the generation responsible for the recession. I'm not blaming anyone personally, but I was gonna do it I wouldn't blame a group of people within a five to ten year gap in <b> age.</b>  That's even more retarded.",

You don't know what we've been through. We saw the world get dark as teenagers and 9/11 is something gen y saw and lived. Imagine as a kid having peace and and war start. We aren't hippies and don't judge us. Maybe look at the events we went through and the promises we grew up being told that were untrue. Gen y isn't to blame. Gen y actually wants to understand & hear gen z and each generation has its skills. Honestly be careful of your claims because gen y actually knows technology just as much as gen z and the last of gen y is actually 23 to early 30's and we are young enough to learn technology so don't judge. We don't want to judge you",

When I got out at <b> age </b>of 17, I realized it was straight up lies and no one wants to hire a thug. I could go on and on. But my point is the world we live in is a construct of the previous generation. All the road blocks we face, majority are because of the expectations of us by the previous generation. I'm 24 now and my generation has not had enough time to change anything yet we are still in our early to midish 20s",

You are right in that it's a pendulum. Politically speaking, once it swings one way, it must swing the other, and it will most likely continue in cycles of extremes. Just like Gen Z is rebelling against the Millennium generation, the next generation will do the same to this one and the pendulum will swing back. Don't get caught up in illusory superiority.",

Actually the closest mainstream accent to older forms would probably be the Irish accent.\n\nThis phenomenon is a result of the fact that different pronunciations sounded \"posher\" to the southern English people so they began to adopt it more readily while in America people didn't care if you sounded posher and this the language stayed relatively the same.\n\nThe place in which British English is more conservative in would be spelling. For example, originally it was \"Colour\" not the American \"Color\". Much of these American spelling were the result of an American person trying to standardise English spelling to be more phonetic. Most of these changes never went through so American English ended up with a half-baked phonetic dictionary in which the spellings are even more confusing. For example the word \"Women\" was supposed to be changed to \"Wimmen\" but the public rejected it so it remained as \"women\".\n\n\nWhy the fuck do I know this?",

As you said, people find out their own information. I think that's more of something that will happen as the children of the generation mature. Personally I'm centralized on logic and looking at all possibilities, all standpoints, and the truth of the matter. I invest myself in topics to the point where I have spent 50+ hours researching a singular topic, reading every word from hundreds of websites and books. We have many people who are on opposite sides of the spectrum, though. My hope is that the few social media obsessed preppy people open themselves up a bit more. Someone of those people lack true aspirations, but I think many of us understand the world and can see it in many different lights. Realists sounds pretty good. Everyone I interact with in my grade has a realistic understanding on topics. Guess we're a generation of individuality, distinction and (generally educated) opinions. Though maybe I'm just being hopeful, lol \ud83d\ude02",

As far as war goes, our generation will be generals and chiefs etc, DON'T LET OUR GENERATION/GEN Y CHANGE OUR MILITARY STANDARDS! I don't give a shit what they say they feel. \nTry to keep your families together, our parents were too hopped up on cocain and <b> dumb </b>shit in the 80s and 90s to keep their heads straight so do us all a favor and be better parents for your kids so no one needs to write another angsty bullshit song about how mommy or daddy didn't love them. \nGo with your gut and be creative, don't let some feggit tell you how to run your own shit. You only live once.....even though I hate that that saying became a meme. \nOh and one more thing, Gen Y will soon be in charge of any deep state affairs, hidden projects or global agendas, DO NOT LET THEM GENETICALLY MODIFY, MANIPULATE, PANDER, OR SPEW ANY PROPAGANDA PROMOTING DEGENERACY TO YOU! \nI mean shit, when we babysat you guys you saw enough disney channel to know whats up, and I assure you, your favorite disney stars from back then aren't going wacko by random chance, we know why dirty<b>  old</b> men like harvey weinstein and dirt<b> y ol</b>d disney execs \"enjoy\" working with little kids so much, try to see past the manipulation that Gen Y had to deal with with our mainstream media etc. Food for thought, the mainstream media fucked up our generation so bad half the mother fuckers left don't have a single thought of their own nor can they function without whining when challenged. Don't censor yourself, and be yourself. Now here's to hoping that you guys can make it through the time space continuum all in once piece in the next few years. You have to....cause your youngest brother/sister/cousin who's like 6 right now is counting on your ass. \n\nOh and 9/11 happened back in 2001 btw, never forget. No matter how tall you build your ego, it can always be torn down.\n\nOh and one more thing, stop dying your hair purple blue green and whatever the fuck, its been a shitty looking fad since the 90s and will continue to make you looke like a low self esteem cock mongler.
