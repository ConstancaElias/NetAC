        "postText": "New Zealand\u2019s Burger King chain is under fire because of a new advert featuring customers attempting to eat burgers with chopsticks.', 'The advert is a promotion for the fast food restaurant\u2019s new Vietnamese sweet chilli chicken sandwich \u2013 and it shows customers struggling to eat their meal with giant red chopsticks.', '\u2018Take your taste buds all the way to Ho Chi Minh City with our Vietnamese Sweet Chili Tendercrisp, part of our Tastes of the World range. Available for a limited time only,\u2019 read the original caption accompanying the post on Instagram.', 'The ad has since been removed from social media following complaints of cultural insensitivity, but it resurfaced on Twitter as a woman accused the global brand of making fun of Asians.', '\u2018This is how Asians eat,\u2019 she wrote sarcastically in a series of tweets.', '\u2018Orientalism is harmless fun\u2026 I\u2019m so sick of racism. Of any kind. Of the kind that makes fun of different cultures #GiveNothingToRacism.\u2019', 'The video was shared on Twitter on the 4th April and has since been viewed more than 2.7 million times. But there has been a torrent of backlash on Twitter.', 'One tweeted: \u2018This ad is the worst \u2013 get your f***ing ad department\u2019s s*** together.\u2019', 'Another said: \u2018This ad just yelled \u201cching chong\u201d at me with its eyes pulled up and asked me if I eat dogs.\u2019', '\u2018LOL chopsticks amirite?\u2019 added another. \u2018Who the hell came up with this? There are a lot of Asian people in NZ, though they probably aren\u2019t getting their Vietnamese food from Burger King.\u2019', 'Burger King are yet to respond to our request for comment.",
