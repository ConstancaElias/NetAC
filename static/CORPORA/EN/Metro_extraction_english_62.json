        "postText": "Women in the UK risk losing hard-fought employment rights and equality standards after Brexit, according to a report being unveiled tomorrow.', 'It says pregnant and breastfeeding workers might not be granted the same protections after Britain leaves the European Union and that the country\u2019s gender pay gap could widen further.', 'The Brexit and Women report warns the Government could prioritise deregulating the economy over laws protecting female workers in order to strike trade deals.', 'After losing millions in EU funding every year the future survival of many domestic violence and support services could hang in the balance.', 'Meanwhile women, who make up the majority of benefit recipients and public service users and workers, are likely to bear the brunt of government cuts expected after Brexit.', 'Speaking to Metro.co.uk, co-author and former Labour MEP Mary Honeyball claimed a trade deal with the USA would easily result in a regulatory race to the bottom of which would disproportionately affect women.', 'She said: \u2018They are a lot more powerful, they are bigger than us for a start. They are going to be calling the shots, which is extremely concerning.', '\u2018They just don\u2019t have much in the way of workers\u2019 rights it \u2018s just not in the American vocabulary particularly \u2013 they don\u2019t have holidays they don\u2019t have maternity leave\u2019.', 'The report by the Socialists and Democrats European group says the scrapping of labour laws coupled with pressure to loosen up the economy for a trade deal could see the widening of the UK\u2019s gender pay gap widen \u2013 despite it already being the fourth worst in the EU.', 'If Brexit goes badly, the economic fallout could see more and more women taking on the role of unpaid carers as public services are put under pressure.', 'This could see the country\u2019s gender pension gap widen beyond the current 40 per cent, according to the publication set to be presented at London\u2019s Europe house tomorrow.', 'It says women are \u2018not on the agenda of Brexit\u2019 and that gender equality was not mentioned once in the Withdrawal Act 2018.', 'The report adds: \u2018Throughout the past three years, there has been little to no Government attention or action in response to the mounting evidence that women will be the ones to bear the brunt of Brexit, from their rights and prosperity to the slowing progress of gender equality.\u2019', 'According to the findings, the Prime Minister has refused to rule out scrapping the EU\u2019s Pregnant Workers\u2019 Directive, which entitles UK women to pre-birth appointments, maternity leave and protection against replacement and discrimination.', 'Women in the UK are also expected to lose out on upcoming EU protections including 40 per cent gender quotas on company boards and the Work-Life Balance Directive, which helps parents share the burden of childcare.', 'Ms Honeyball has little faith in Boris Johnson reinstating the same standards once the country begins life outside the EU.', 'She said: \u2018He\u2019s done away with the level playing field. Theresa May\u2019s agreement, for all its faults, did say the UK would be told there would be a level playing field on these issues.\u2019', 'The report says women in the UK make up three-in-four of the UK\u2019s part-time workers, partly due to childcare responsibilities.', 'It says they are at a highest risk of an \u2018erorison of rights\u2019 currently protected by the EU\u2019s Agency and Part Time Workers directives, which are not guaranteed to be replaced.', 'Ms Honeyball added: \u2018I think always you need a lot of pressure to get governments to legislate on women\u2019s rights, it never just happens, and if you take away the European Union and you have a right-wing government it\u2019s going to be very hard to make happen.', '\u2018It\u2019s going to be heard to make happen with a left-wing government too.\u2019', 'As the majority of public service users, recipients of benefits, public sector workers and unpaid carers, the report says women will be hit the hardest by post-Brexit austerity.', 'Ms Honeyball added: \u2018I do honestly think resources will be tight for everything.', '\u2018Women wont get pay rises, there wont be any increases in maternity leave or any protection at work.', 'They are also expected to be impacted more by sudden price hikes for household goods, as the main \u2018shock absorbers\u2019 of family poverty.\u2019', '\u2018Life changing and life saving\u2019 services for women are expected to lose out on funding at a time when \u2018rates of female-targeted violence in the UK are among the worst in Europe and violence against women is on the rise\u2019.', 'The Black, Asian, Minority Ethnic and disabled women will be disproportionately affected by cuts services, according to the report.', 'Ms Honeyball added: \u2018If you think austerity is bad now, it will get much worse.\u2019', 'A Government spokesperson told Metro.co.uk: \u2018We are determined to make the UK the best place in the world to work and do business.', '\u2018We\u2019re bringing forward the largest upgrade to workers\u2019 rights in a generation, and have absolutely no intention of lowering our world-leading high standards after Brexit.', '\u2018We already exceed EU minimums or outperform the EU average in a number of areas, such as maternity leave and annual leave- and our gender pay gap in the UK is at a record low.\u2019",
