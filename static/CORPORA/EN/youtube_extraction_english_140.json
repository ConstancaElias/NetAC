This old-school stiff authoritative figure just makes everyone feel uncomfortable especially if your young and not so bothered about hierarchy anymore. Dropping the ego and focusing on being open, encouraging and positivity will help allot. I'm 46 and love working with young designers, I'm freelance and not worried about my position I just enjoy great ideas and being around good people.",

While the \"flat org\" is where many companies are going there still needs to be a celebration and utilization of the accumulated experience older contributors bring to the table...and unfortunately that perspective is getting more rare in the industry.",

But, I didn't let it bother me, and others over 40 shouldn't be concerned either. There are other sectors to design for with an older demographic.

I got into digital design 30 years ago then transferred into motion graphics then video production. I've never been more skilled and accomplished in my life. However, If I worked for someone else I'd get less than half of what I'm worth, not enough to pay bills. I agree, the answer is to build your own brand AND work with someone who excels in marketing before you go it alone. Design is very accessible now, the market is saturated and there are too many players. Employers know this too and prey of it.",

I'm in the prime of my career but f-cked trying to find a job - not that I really want to work for someone else. I've taught at a few film and tv schools (motion graphics, DSLRs, editing etc.) I honestly felt like telling the students that this might become a hobby for them not a profession. I don't think I'm being pessimistic about the design industry situation, just realistic. I'm pretty sure the music industry has gone down the same path as well. Many of the available jobs out there specify design skills as a subset of another profession ie. wanted: Journalist, must know motion graphics and editing, or wanted: Marketer, must know video skills, HTML5 coder, must know photoshop and editing... the design landscape has shifted dramatically. Here's another issue that I'd like to bring up... to get ahead as a young kid in school, you have to be gifted academically, not creatively. There's not as many options for a creative career nowadays. I feel for young creatives.",

Any digital manifest version of your brand will be a representation of who you are as a person, but digital. I can attest to this insomuch as I have made use of my own network and relationships to enable my own work and indeed career. Essentially working with friends does rule, but, you need to be emotionally mature enough to make sure it does work. Thus being an older designer can save the day.",

I started in my 20s and am now 45, but because I work in the public service, I've continued to consult externally over the years since it's the only way to learn new skills and remain current. \n\n\nIn my case, I got sidelined for any advancement but the work keeps coming. <b> Senior </b>leadership rave about summer students coming in to work in my unit, not because their work is great, but because they're young. There's this belief that everything they put out is \"gonna be amazing!\" Meanwhile, due to their youth they haven't fully developed the skills to do the job as well. Not saying they're bad, but years of experience (along with constant learning and growth) means as an older creative, my work is usually not only better, but delivered with a faster turn around. Add to that not all of them are open to suggestions on how to do things, because they already believe they're better than me just by being younger. \n\n\nThe sidelining is like an Atlas Shrugged moment, where I'm expected do my job and pick up their slack, but am never recognized for how much that truly involves.  If they do, it's usually begrudgingly. For the most part they act like they're entitled to all this experience and we're supposed to act like we don't know how good we are. \n\n\nIt's not just the workplace either, but academic institutions as well. Back in my 20s you couldn't get a university degree in creative design, but I loved it so I'm self-taught. Today, one of our best universities for such programs won't offer it part-time. Full-time only, means people like us with years of practical experience but lacking that piece of paper, can't get in unless we quit our day jobs. Not one image on their website of all the happy students in that program, look a day over 22...it speaks volumes.\n\n\nFreelancing keeps me going at least. It's my \"Who is John Galt?\" stance to the day job...save the real creativity for myself. LOL! So until my eyes go or arthritis kicks in, they won't<b>  age</b> me out. ^_^",

Employers and agencies seem to think that those above 30 (35 best case scenario) have <b> nothing </b>to contribute. Some of the best designers and creative minds I know are well into their 40s or even older. Sometimes I think it's just an excuse to pay the employees less as a young person might be willing to accept a lower pay in order to get the gig or because they need less money to get by. One time, at an agency I worked at, we got an incredible portfolio and resume, we called the person in for an interview/meeting and when he got to the offices he was an older guy, possibly in his late 40s early 50s, the look on the faces of some of my colleagues was such a let down. It was like his<b>  age</b> had already disqualified him and some didn't pay attention to what he had do said during the meeting, that was so rude and I even had an argument with some of them because of that. Of course, they didn't hire him and soon afterwords I started looking for another place to work, I just didn't feel that was the place for me anymore.

Maybe it's due to the B2B typical lack of fuzziness or the fact that the agency will be 50 years in business and still owner operated (second generation), but I saw designers retire in their mid 60s. That's in northern Germany. I was always very much on the edge about aging in the industry, here I feel like I can let my guard down a  bit. Not too much though. ;) But great input, as always!",

The design org. fractionated design roles into more specialized roles that had very little creative latitude while creating a heavy design calendar with various gates and dates. They started hiring designers for those roles directly from college (usually design director Alumni colleges) with no previous footwear industry experience. These designers never knew they lost major design perks like, Design show travel, market research travel, event and product launch opportunities, and worst in my opinion (especially for a consumer products company) they were no longer invited or involved with brand athletes and focus groups for product design. \nThis also created a very cliquish atmosphere on campus within design between new vs. experienced designers. \nUltimately, It lead to an exodus of experienced designers leaving for better roles at other companies. It's why under armor was able to thrive when they began and it also fueled the competitor companies into making a comeback.",
