        "postText": "John Boyega has expressed his outrage over a scene in Spike Lee\u2019s series, She\u2019s Gotta Have It, which features a debate between two characters about black British actors and slavery.', 'The nine-part Netflix series, which is based on Spike\u2019s classic 1986 movie of the same name, debuted its second season on 24 May.', 'Viewers have taken particular issue with a scene which features the character Nola Darling (DeWanda Wise), describing black British actors as \u2018cheap\u2019.', 'Star Wars actor John, 27, saw a clip of the scene circulating online and simply labelled it: \u2018Trash.\u2019', 'Starting off the debate, Nola says: \u2018[Black British actors] need to fall back and fall away from taking all of our roles, like we have dope, talented, trained, qualified black actors right here in the States.', '\u2018But at the end of the day, black Brits just come cheaper\u2019.', 'With a questionable British accent, character Olumide Owoye (Michael Luwoye) chimed in: \u2018I agree somewhat. But black British actors are better suited than black American actors for Stateside roles because they don\u2019t carry the burden of f****d up black American history, of lynching, slavery, Jim Crow, all that.\u2019', '\u2018Black Brits are free of the psychological burden and therefore they can really delve into black American s**t.\u2019', 'Ironically, Nola then wonders how \u2018someone so gorgeous\u2019 could be so \u2018ignorant\u2019 despite her own comments just moments before.', 'In an attempt to educate Olu on black British history, Nola continued: \u2018You\u2019re not unburdened Olu. British ships were the dominant force in the Atlantic slave trade.', '\u2018Almost two million kidnapped Africans who died during the Middle Passage so you and your mans and your fellow black British blokes didn\u2019t come out of the s**t unscathed.\u2019', 'Digging herself a bigger hole, Nola added: \u2018You just have Stockholm syndrome and fell in love with your captors.\u2019', 'Needless to say, the dialogue has infuriated viewers with much of the criticism aimed at Spike.', 'Accusing the Oscar-winning director of disliking non-American black actors, a critic weighed in: \u2018I think Spike should just say he has an issue with black people from other countries coming to Hollywood and getting work. I would also love Spike to address the colorism in his work. A lot of this is just anti blackness cloaked in xenophobia.\u2019', 'Sharing everyone else\u2019s sentiments, another said: \u2018I\u2019m not British but this dialogue is so incredibly ignorant and irresponsible.\u2019', 'Quoting one particular line from the scene, another added: \u2018No but #ShesGottaHaveIt2 really really reeeeeeally said [black brits] have stockholm syndrome and fell in love with our captors. do you know how UNF*****GBELIEVABLY offensive that s**t is?????? but we can\u2019t catch a fart in the wind to say \u201chey uhhh maybe you guys don\u2019t know us?
