        "postText": "Every school in Britain will be given support to be able to teach children about same-sex relationships in the wake of anti-LGBT protests by some parents.', 'Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said headteachers should be \u2018able to teach about Britain as it is today\u2019 and will be delivering support to schools ahead of the September 2020 mandatory introduction of same-sex relationship education.', 'In some of his first comments on the matter since being appointed to his new role, Mr Williamson added that the government has \u2018set out quite clearly\u2019 the law and said there is no place for protests outside any school.', 'He said: \u2018Firstly, we shouldn\u2019t be seeing protests outside any schools.', '\u2018We want to make sure all pupils, parents and teachers are able to go to those schools freely without any form of intimidation.', '\u2018We will be there supporting and backing every single school \u2013 that\u2019s what we have been doing.', '\u2018The purpose of it is we wanted to make sure every single school is able to teach about Britain as it is today \u2013 but also have the flexibility to ensure that it has an understanding of the communities which it operates in.\u2019', 'Before the summer holidays, anti-LGBT protests were held by parents outside Anderton Park and Parkfield Community Primary schools in Birmingham, with a separate demonstration outside the gates of Nottingham\u2019s Fernwood Primary.', 'Demonstrators claimed that teaching about LGBT relationships was \u2018over-emphasising a gay ethos\u2019 and that the teachings were not \u2018age appropriate\u2019.', 'Counter-protesters also congregated outside the schools, with LGBT campaigners slamming the \u2018homophobic\u2019 demonstrations.', 'Mr Williamson said he had no plans to visit the headteacher of Birmingham\u2019s Anderton Park Primary School, Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson, who said she was subjected to weeks of abuse after weaving information about the Equality Act into her school\u2019s wider curriculum.', 'In June, the headteacher \u2013 who claims she received death threats \u2013 called for Mr Williamson\u2019s predecessor, Damian Hinds, to visit and have a discussion about the current policy on relationships and LGBT education in schools.', 'Speaking at the time, she warned of the angry demonstrations spreading without the government giving more support to schools affected.', 'She said: \u2018The importance of this goes beyond Anderton Park, it goes beyond protests on my pavements \u2013 it\u2019s a British law issue.\u2019', 'The DfE said it has been working \u2018very closely\u2019 with heads on the issue and Mr Hinds did meet union officials and officers from Birmingham City Council.', 'Parkfield school\u2019s \u2018No Outsiders\u2019 equality education programme, which taught about diversity and difference in modern society, was suspended last term in the wake of parent protests.', 'But in July, the school announced that a modified version of it would return in the new term.', 'In June, the Department for Education published guidance encouraging schools to adopt the new curriculum on relationships education from this September.",

Smoking kills etc. There is a difference between ignorance and stupidity and these efforts often come across as condecending.But to answer your question, all a person really needs are basic maths and english. What use is shakespearean literature or algebra in every day life? But I digress",

Society in your express view, should be a collection of people who can merely add and read.FYI, Algebra is a subset of Maths, so the Maths curriculum would have be to revised. Likewise, Shakespeare was English, so would have to be written out of the curriculum. If the majority of the general population shares your views, then no doubt Geography, Science, History, Languages, Art and Music will soon disappear from school curricula.",

                    "commentText": "Derek Williams It was a waste of time for me. I have probably learned more outside of a educational environment than I ever did in one. You also have the issue of \"sets\". the highest set is \"generally\" filled with kids that want to learn, and the lowest one filled with a \"doctored\" curriculum for shall we say \"slower\" pupils. I mean no disrepect to anyone when I say that by the way. Then you have the middle set which is mixed with both. I lost track of the ammount of my lessons that never went anywhere because you had the same disruptive clowns that did <b> nothing </b>but kick off and a teacher that couldn't cope with them. Everyone suffers.I understand that curriculums have subsets, but thats what we have the \"options\" for in years 9+ (provided that hasn't changed since my day) more niche things like algebra etc could be dropped in favour of things that a child would actually have use for. music and drama etc is no use to anyone unless you have talent in it. both subjects in my school were relegated to options anyway from year 9+. those that wanted to do them could and those that didn't wouldn't have to.But back to the original topic. how many times must a smoker for example be told that their habit causes cancer etc? it won't make any difference to them putting mesages and graphic images to that effect on packaging. those that know the risks of smoking wouldn't take the habit up in the first place. which in layman's terms is what I was getting at all along.",
