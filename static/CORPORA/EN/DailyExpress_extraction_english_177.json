        "postText": "The divisive Speaker of the Commons claimed expenses on a range of luxury activities and goods, figures released to the Mail Online under the freedom of information act have revealed. A staggering \u00a312,352 of public money was spent to fund Mr Bercow and his secretary\u2019s trip to Canada to meet business leaders last July. A further \u00a3660 was forked out on the four star Lords Nelson hotel, to ensure he had a comfy stay during the three-day conference.', 'Further trips to Switzerland in September 2018 cost \u00a3389 and a trip to Latvia in March set taxpayers\u2019 back a further \u00a31285.', 'Hard-working Britons are also funding the Speaker to the tune of thousands for him and his family to live in a rent-free apartment at Parliament.', 'Meanwhile Mr Bercow is also understood to have claimed around \u00a3113 for his monthly Sky Sports subscription and \u00a341 worth of on-demand films, although this was later reimbursed.', 'A further \u00a3235 was spent on drinks at a dinner for senior parliamentarians as well as \u00a370 on photos to send to his \u2018fan club\u2019.', 'The Commons Speaker is no stranger to controversy and has fuelled divisions in parliament throughout the Brexit process with his choice of amendments for MPs to vote on.', 'He also hit the headlines for refusing to let the Prime Minister bring back her withdrawal agreement to parliament without any changes.', 'Mr Bercow also vetoed Donald Trump from addressing parliament during his first visit to the UK as US President in 2017.', 'The Speaker had insisted Mr Trump should not be allowed to do so because of MPs\u2019 \u201copposition to racism and to sexism\u201d.', 'Mr Bercow has been the Commons Speaker since June 2009.', 'Previously he had reportedly told friends he was planning to stand down in the summer, having spent 10 years in the post.', 'However earlier this week, he stated he had no immediate plans to step down while \u201cmomentous events taking place in Parliament\u201d.', 'He added it was not \u201csensible to vacate the chair\u201d at the moment.', 'Mr Bercow told The Guardian: \u201cI\u2019ve never said anything about going in July of this year.', '\u201cSecondly, I do feel that now is a time in which momentous events are taking place and there are great issues to be resolved and in those circumstances, it doesn\u2019t seem to me sensible to vacate the chair.', '\u201cIf I had any intention to announce on that matter I would do so to Parliament first.\u201d', 'A spokeswoman for Mr Bercow said: \u201cThe Speaker attends the annual G7 Speakers\u2019 conference wherever it is held.', '\u201cLast year, this was in Nova Scotia, and followed the G7 summit of world leaders in Quebec, which was attended by the Prime Minister.', '\u201cThe Speaker and his Private Secretary travel business class on long haul flights.\u201d', 'Regarding the Panel of Chairs, the spokeswoman said: \u201cThe Speaker\u2019s office pays for the drinks reception beforehand and drinks served at the table.', '\u201cThe panel of chairs\u2019 pay for their own food.\u201d', 'Mr Bercow is not restricted by the same spending rules as MPs, who are not allowed to claim expenses for food or alcohol.",

Once again the politicians are adept at coming up with allowable expenses enabling them to live week in, week out without spending any of their OWN money just OURS. Look at the ranre of public money he has spent. Overseas trips, WHY ? That is not necessary to do his job. Sky Sports, How is THAT necessary ? I accept there may be a need for the odd drinks reception but WHY and WHO are we paying for ? Let us get a <b> BREXIT </b>MP who will ask these questions in the house. Let us face the fact that NO ONE currently in the swamp will be asking in case their OWN spending of OUR money will be revealed AGAIN. Useless and DISHONEST. We really do need to drain the swamp. ",
