Apparently, according to them we\u2019re all gonna die by Friday because we\u2019re in the Rocky Horror Show!\u2019', 'The protesters were back for the show\u2019s second night, but this time some members of the local gay community decided to make a stand.', 'Joe and Robert were photographed standing directly in front of the protest group engaging in a passionate kiss, in an image that some have labelled \u2018iconic\u2019.', 'Joe said: \u2018When we arrived, there was lots of shouting between the protesters and audience members waiting outside the theatre.', '\u2018The problem with that is you can\u2019t fight hate with hate, which is why we decided to spread some love.', '\u2018I respect everyone is entitled to their opinion, however, I am also entitled to kiss my boyfriend wherever I want without judgment, and that\u2019s what we are fighting for.\u2019",
