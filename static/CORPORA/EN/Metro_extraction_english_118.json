        "postText": "Edinburgh University has been accused of \u2018blatant racism\u2019 for hosting a conference on equality which bans white people from asking questions.', 'The event, called \u2018Resisting Whiteness 2019\u2019, takes place on Saturday and purports to \u2018amplify the voices of people of colour\u2019 and give \u2018people of colour a platform to talk\u2019.', 'According to a blurb, reported by the Daily Mail, organisers will \u2018therefore not be giving the microphone to white people during the Q&As\u2019.', 'One of the two \u2018safe spaces\u2019 is similarly \u2018for only people of colour\u2019, while the other is open to those feeling \u2018overwhelmed/overstimulated or uncomfortable\u2019.', 'Held at the Pleasance Theatre, tickets cost up to \u00a320.', 'An anti-racism campaigner from Glasgow, 42-year-old Jane McColl, told the newspaper the event is \u2018blatantly racist\u2019.', 'She added: \u2018Imagine if this event was called \u2018Resisting Blackness\u2019 and non-white people were told they could not ask questions, nor access a room because they were the \u2018wrong\u2019 colour.\u2019', 'A spokesman for the University of Edinburgh said the institution placed great importance on tackling racism and supported events addressing the issue.', 'He added that \u2018the University has met with the event organisers to ensure the event is compliant with our values\u2019 and \u2018expressed our concerns to them about certain aspects of the format\u2019.",
