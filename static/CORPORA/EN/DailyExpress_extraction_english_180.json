        "postText": "'Former Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Stephen Crabb, shut down his fellow guests during a segment of BBC Two\u2019s Newsnight. Sat across from the Liberal Democrat's Layla Moran, and Labour\u2019s candidate for Uxbridge, Ali Milani, Mr Crabb scourged them over what would happen should either of their parties win the December general election.', 'He said: People in this country understand the context of this election, why this election is being held.', 'We\u2019ve had three and a half years of the House of Commons going around in circles chasing its tail.', 'Nothing is getting done.', 'Not Brexit.', 'Not any of the big issues.', 'Emily Maitlis interjected, saying: You are all the House of Commons, you do know that?', 'Stephen Crabb ignored Ms Maitlis and continued his attack, explaining: People out there in the country understand why this election has been called.', 'Before he continued, Labour candidate for Uxbridge, Ali Milani, corrected Ms Maitlis and said: Not yet!', 'Acknowleding this, she replied: Not yet, yes indeed, and laughed.', 'Mr Crabb didn 't stop and continued:It\u2019s because they know that it\u2019s not in their national interest to carry on doing the same.', 'Forgive me, but both the Liberal Democrats and their remain alliance, and the Labour Party are promising years more of going around in circles with nothing happening. ', ' This is why Boris Johnson is reading public opinion correctly and saying we\u2019 ve got to break this cycle. ', ' Layla Moran responded with: Absolutely not!No.Stop Brexit is quite clear Stephen. ', ' Ali Milani looked into the distance without replying. ', 'The Remain Alliance plan Mr Crabb talked about surfaced following a Sky News interview with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson, who hinted at the prospect of her party making a pact with Plaid Cymru and the Green Party in certain seats to ensure a hefty Remain victory. ', 'The move would look to mimic the victory won by the Lib Dems in the Brecon and Radnorshire by - election in August in which Plaid and the Greens chose not to field candidates in order to rid the region of Tory rule.', 'Though Ms Swinson didn\u2019 t cave into pressure to admit that the Lib Dems were planning this tactic in up to 60 seats, she did suggest that a Remain Alliance was on the table.', 'She said: The specifics of announcements will be made in due course but it's well understood that these discussions have been taking place.', 'I wouldn 't necessarily assume that the numbers are accurate.', 'I think it's fair to say that in the vast majority of constituencies the party of Remain that is going to be best - placed to win that seat will be the Liberal Democrats.', 'Mr Milani could too shake things up for Mr Johnson 's Government, looking to push him out of his hitherto safe seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip.', ' Added to this is the threat from climate action group Extinction Rebellion, who have vowed to launch a bid to oust Mr Johnson from his seat. ', ' If Mr Johnson fails to get reelected but the Conservative Party win a majority, he could theoretically keep his position as Prime Minister if he appointed himself as a Lord. ', ' He would, however, likely face huge pressure to give up his position. ', ' Mr Milani is thought to have the vote of the youth in Uxbridge - the race for the classically Tory seat will prove decisive in how the politics of a post - Brexit UK shapes up.",
