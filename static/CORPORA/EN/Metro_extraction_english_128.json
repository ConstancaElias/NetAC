        "postText": "A popular YouTube bedtime story has been slammed as racist for showing an angel turn darker skinned when she is cursed.', 'The fairy tale, by My Pingu TV, shows a woman agreeing to give up her beauty to be able to talk to her husband.', 'In the video, which has been viewed more than 380,000 times, Dina has to hide the fact she is an angel from her husband, and every night leaves the palace to go and sing in heaven.', 'After the husband the prince follows her and asks why she is so sad, she starts to talk to him.', 'This activates the spell and she is warned by the sky king that she will become uglier.', 'In the video, she is described as losing \u2018her beauty and her youth\u2019.', '\u2018Her glow is gone and her face is scarred,\u2019 the narrator says.', 'But all that really seems to have changed is that she has darker skin and curly hair.', 'People watching were quick to point this out, accusing the cartoon\u2019s makers of racism for implying that white skin is more beautiful.', 'One viewer wrote: \u2018So you\u2019re okay teaching kids that being black with curly hair is ugly? This channel is disgusting and i\u2019m so sad for young black girls that come across this video.\u2019', 'Another said: \u2018And that\u2019s how you teach kids to be racist. Please take this down.\u2019', 'Another comment said: \u2018To all dark skin girls and women reading this post: YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.\u2019', 'YouTube and My Pingu TV have been contacted for comment.",
