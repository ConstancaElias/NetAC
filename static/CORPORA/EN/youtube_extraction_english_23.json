        "postText": " Julia Hardy tells us how she uses humour to combat endemic online sexism, and explains how the actions of this small percentage of men not only adversely affect and change women's behaviour, but actually cause detriment to other men.  Julie Hardy is a technology and gaming expert based in London, UK and hosts a new radio show on video game culture on BBC Radio 1. Specializing in technology, video games, YouTube and pretty much anything to do with the online self, Julia's work has been featured by BBC TV, Bravo and BAFTA. Julia takes a passionate stance on online issues and created a blog called Misogyny Monday as a platform to raise awareness of the abuse that many women encounter online. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx ",

It depends on the context. But saying you are unconsciously sexist is basically saying \"you are sexist. Don't even think about contemplating on your actions, you can't know you are as you are not conscious about it and for some magical reason you can't evaluate your\u00a0 behavior based on unconscious decisions. You are sexist because I am telling you you are\". It is an argument from a very authorative point of view. It is a logical fallacy.\n\nI agreed with everything in this video except this pretty cringeworthy moment.\n\nAll in all, I liked it. Keep up the good work.",

I've seen it done to other men but they remain silent even though it can be scary when you're a smaller guy being harassed by a big aggressive guy. My wife has been sexually harassed by lesbians in the past. No one talks about harassment as it really is, they, like you, always break it down to a men against women issue. So until you women speak honestly about harassment, forget the help.\n.\nAnd you go on about trolls on the internet? LOL, I've come across large numbers of man hating angry feminist women trolling it up, hating on men, I've seen many from LGBTQ do it, I've seen blacks do it, white nationalists do it, what in the world are you talking about here? Help the women to reduce straight male trolls meanwhile the world is filled with all sorts of troll including trollish women? Incredible. And sure, people can say, \"but it's easier when you focus on one aspect of the issue, like women's issues\". Yes, that's exactly what white nationalist who want to racially segregate the country believes. Lets just focus <b> on ra</b>ce as if that's the real problem.",

Misassumptions of some things that we do or say is because we devalue women. Take the guy who posted the sit on my face. If you told a guy that you want to shove his face in your vagina, does that make you sexist? Awkward, maybe. But sexist no. How is wanting to have <b> sex </b>with someone misogynistic? No one is saying that all they see you for, just like you aren't attracted to a guy just by looks. That is an assumption. That is one the reasons why men can't \"admit\" to being sexist. Because you want them to believe in something based on how you assume it to be rather than what it actually is. I know this is blunt, but I hope this helps your cause",

The basic summation of the feminist position is, Only men lie, and are evil and bad, women never lie or display dishonesty and are universally good. A good rule of thumb for guys is, if you meet a <b> woman </b>depending on the circumstances, subtly find out if she's a feminist. If she is, then walk away, say<b>  nothing</b> else. In her eyes you're already guilty and negatively judged since they view any interaction with guys through a lens of suspicion and nsexism. he could say, \"Gee, it looks like rain today,\" and sure enough the feminist will find a way to interpret it as a sexis<b> t misogynis</b>t statement. Walking away without another word and refusing to deal any further with her won't affect her, because as a feminist, as a guy you've already been charged, tried and convicted as guilty.The central point in  moving on is to maintain your self respect and personal integrity against a feminist   whose primary objective is to sadistically feel that as a man you're  than human.",

For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not \ndeceived, but th<b> e woma</b>n was deceived and became a transgressor. Yet she \nwill be saved through childbearing\u2014if they continue in faith and love \nand holiness, with self-control. 1 Timothy 2:11-15\n\nThe women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted\n to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says. If there \nis anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. \nFor it is shameful for<b>  a wom</b>an to speak in church. 1 Corinthians 14:34-35\n\nWives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is \nthe head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body,\n and is himself its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also\n wives should submit in everything to their husbands. Husbands, love \nyour wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that\n he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with\n the word Ephesians 5:22-33\n\nSo Women should not be in a leader ship role if they are they will go to hell and burn for eternity",

The one thing I noticed which you left out about <b> sexism </b>affecting men too is the fact that society puts men into boxes. Granted the world is a man's world and it is worse for women on the whole but there are several things that happen to men too. Men are seen as weak when they cry or express their feelings, men are seen as feminine when they watch movies like The Notebook, men can't wear high heels or dresses (although frankly why they'd want to I have no idea, I hate high heels and dresses but that's just my opinion). An equal society would be if men and women had exactly the same opportunities and could wear the same clothes and they could both lead in dance and they both could pay on the first date and they could both cry over The Fault in our Stars and there was no domestic violence of any kind from either<b>  gender</b> and they could both be stay at home parents and nannies and nurses, I could go on, and all of this was done without the batting of an eye or any rude comment. Anyway you're awesome. Thank you for being inspiring.",

Maybe some of those first world feminist have spoken so much about equality that you have become so utterly desensitized, but that's also what they're exposed to. There is utter injustice in this world towards the female<b>  race</b>, and being an ignorant internet troll doesn't help the situation.

Second, people often don't care to  constructively fix the things  they see wrong, but prefer to discredit the person and the argument to avoid seeing an individual as a person not too different from themselves. \n\nRegardless of the issue, most people seem more concerned with asserting their rightness on the internet rather than getting to the bottom  of what the cause is. Then you watch both sides dig in their heels because  the discussion turns into an ego battle rather than a constructive dialogue. Life is rough as it is, don't hate the player hate the game. Feminist or otherwise, people are just trying to hold on the best they can. . \n\nThat being said, interesting points were made, there was some logic made that raises <b> red<b>  </b</b>>flags, but I at least admire that she is trying to constructively deal with the harassment she receives on a daily basis. It seems a far better  alternative than the verbal assaults in this comment section. \n\nKudos and be well.",

She calls herself \"the factual feminist\". She makes clearly expressed videos exposing the lies and hypocrisy of radical feminist's. \nEquality feminists should all be doing this, exposing the lies of the radicals. This would promote greater harmony between the sexes. \nThe lack of willingness of most equality feminists to do this means that most feminists are simply indoctrinated by falsehoods, they are led along like sheep by the radicals.\nThe radicals want a war with men. The radical feminists want to break up families and try to convince women that they should be the same as men.\nEquality feminists should, for example, seek to have prison sentences made more equal, (see the video, Criminal sentencing: Do women get off easy? | FACTUAL FEMINIST) they should react in horror to the large numbers of men committing suicide, they should loudly call out the radicals for ignoring female DV perpetrators. They should insist that for every 2 shelters for women there should be one for men etc. \nAfter all, we must fight for equality.\nWhen it comes to using words to hurt and create discomfort, I think women are definitely better at that skill than men.",

Inflexible to the extent that they won't listen to anything other than their own ideology. Are you one of them?",

Can't you put two and two together?\n<b> Black </b>people can run faster than white people on the average, that doesn't mean there is an unfair 'speed' gap. If I argued there was a 'speed' gap between blacks and whites, and that this gap must be eliminated, you would think me silly. Well it makes just as much sense to talk about a pay gap between males and females.\nThe pay gap is caused by feminist propaganda.  I recommend the video by Gary Orsum, *Women In The Workplace *\nThis video highlights the difference between men and women at work.\nAfter that, the earnings gap (there is no pay gap for the SAME work) is contributed to by biology, women give birth, are are more likely to raise the children. Men have been the main protectors and providers for 200,000 years. Recent changes, due to technological advances, can't just wipe out biological evolution. This means men have more motivation, more ambition, more stamina, more perseverance on the average. Women have skills that men don't have, such as motherhood skills and manipulation of men skills.",

Plenty of reading for you.\nI notice that you get plenty of information given to you but you won't look at it. Then you claim victimhood and being bullied. \nIf feminists were interested in equality they would not be interested in being artificially propped up. They are constantly demanding special privileges. \nThe noted public-policy scholar Anne-Marie Slaughter, in a book called Unfinished Business, singled out what she calls the 'care penalty' as a main driver of <b> gender </b>inequity. Here's how Slaughter sees it:\nANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER wrote:\nIf you take women who don't have caregiving obligations, they're almost equal with men. It's somewhere in the 95 percent range. But when women then have children, or again are caring for their own parents or other sick family members who need care, then they need to work differently. They need to work flexibly, and often go part-time. They often get less-good assignments because their bosses think that they're not going to want work that allows them to travel, or they're not going to be able to stay up all night, or whatever it is. And so then you start \u2014 if you're working part-time, you don't get the same raises. And if you're working flexibly your boss very typically thinks that you're not that committed to your career, so you don't get promoted.",

It's often the case that women will leave the very large law firms that put a lot of time demands on them and go to smaller firms or become corporate counsel, become part-time corporate counsel, perhaps, for a while. They will go to small firms where the workload is somewhat different.

Some are but totally ignored and would never get a TED talk to tell the world about it. My issues is that we are constantly bombarded by feminism telling us that women are the same as men. I don't agree with this statement as you seem not to. \n\nFeminism tells us that women are the same as men and can do what men can do and that they should be treated the same as men and yet somehow they should be offered special treatment because of their feelings. To be believed without evidence, to have college places and jobs handed to them just because they are women. Feminists need to let men be men and women to be women as we are not the same and then we should just live, love and work together focusing on our strengths and what we have in <b> common.</b>",

It is not right for anyone to abuse anyone else.  I believe in equality of opportunity.\n\nHow are <b> black </b>and white people different? (Other than the colour of their skin)\n\nIn the west women and men are treated as equals and women are not treated as inferior or property. This is the safest and most successful culture that there has ever been.\n\nNo men i know thinks that they have the right to control a women's body but your remarks about disparaging remarks made to women are determined by how upset the<b>  woman</b> is. So unless the man is a mind reader there is no way he is going to know if he is going to upset the women. Sure there are men and women morons out there but that is life. You cannot legislate for someone's feelings being hurt. The impact of what was said can be greatly different depending on who is saying it. If she likes them then it is ok. If she doesn't then perhaps it is not ok. You know that that happens. You can see it happening every night in every night club around the world.\n\nI don't see it at all the same as using racial slang. That is aimed at <b> a rac</b>e when what we are talking about is one man talking to one women.\n\nA lot of very vocal feminists take it too far and it is they who are setting the agenda and tone of this kind of conversation. We are constantly being told that women are the same as men and just as strong and can do the same jobs and then turn around and demand that the are protected from nasty words because they are violence..... which is it the same and as strong or not??? \n\nThere is, however, some validity to say that mainly men and women have certain strengths and weaknesses that make them better at certain tasks. (I speak in general terms) Women are more risk adverse which makes them more cautious which is why men will be in the most dangerous jobs and suffer the most workplace deaths (I notice there is absolutely no noise from the feminists to have equal employment in these types of jobs. It may also be why men occupy many of the highest paid jobs as they tend to be the one taking the risks. Progress is driven mainly by men. Women tend to leave the job market to have and look after children and men do not and so continue to progress their career. Men work more hours and put in more over time than women\n\nIt is not about being better it is about as good as you can and letting people work to their strengths.\n\nAre you saying that affirmative action in favour of women does not exist?\n\nI do not know what \"actually 90% of men have those prestige, high paying jobs, and only 50% of women.\" means. By its self it makes no sense.",

Looks up the facts. Stop trying to make up <b> lame </b>excuses. Everyone knows there is job discrimination when it comes to women. You never really see women being CEOs, or presidents, or getting paid equally as men. You do know that its a fact the wage gap exists. Why should I get paid less for doing the same work simply because of my<b>  gender</b>? If there's n<b> o gende</b>r discrimination in the workplace, tell me why that occurs. And come on, you don't know if she will get angry? Let me make it easy: if a rand<b> om wom</b>an walks by you and you whistle to her like a dog, she will be angry. Of course there are exceptions, but we're talking about majority here. And you wonder why ev<b> ery wo</b>man who gets cat called is upset about it. Honestly you don't have the right to yell inappropri<b> ate, se</b>xual things at someone. Like who are you? The minute a guy stops treat<b> ing a </b>woman like a lady, he gives up the right to be treated like a man. If you want respect, give respect. Telling inappropriate, dirty things about someone's body does not show you respect them. Here's a good rule: if it's something the general public sees as offensive, maybe don't shout it out. And in regards <b> to the</b> black vs. white thing, they are different because they come from different cultures, have a different way of doing things. But they are equally human. I <b> know an </b>African American who says he hates it when people say we are all the same, because white people don't fully understand where blank people are comimg from, or their culture. It's not just about skin color. Just like Mexicans or Asians have different cultures abs different struggles, it would be ignorant of you to say they are the same as us when you don't know their culture. But at the same time, you can expect that different is good and beneficial, and we all have equal rights because we are all human. It doesn't matter if women are different than you. In the United States, we do not discriminate based on amount of Physical Strength, height, personality, or reproductive body parts. So it doesn't matter how dif<b> ferent</b> a woman is. She's a human<b>  being</b>. A woman gave birth to you, so you have no right to disrespect one. Men and women can do different things that the other one can't. You forget without us there would be no people and there would be no men. You can't do it in your own, because society would be wiped out. Men need women. And vice versa too. All im saying is that if you need somebody, you better care about their struggles and what they think.",

Like she mentioned, it comes from a societal pre-program that we are often not conscious about which might have been developed from personal experiences, the media or stories from friends/family. Realistically speaking, we all unconsciously attribute certain characteristics to women, children, people who practice certain professions or people of a certain <b> race </b>(whether it be positive or negative) due to ideas which have been formed (unconsciously) by our experiences or the society in general, and ultimately, they will affect our (initial) response towards them. But this does not mean that any group of people should be hated because of the actions of one or a few individuals in that group, it simply explains the psychology behind human responses. This is why as a society, we need to discourage negative behaviours (towards any group) and negative representations (of any group) in the society so as to prevent/discontinue such negative reactions.

Same goes for the speaker, she also has pre-formed ideas of men (well not all men as she clarified) based on personal experiences which is what she tries to explain in this presentation. So applying your reasoning with hers, \u2018men treat women like shit because women like to be treated like shit'. However, I am not certain whether this is an accurate conclusion of both sexes therefore, I restate that negative behaviours and attributions towards any group should be prevented and discouraged in the society as much as we possibly can :)",

However, there are certain developments in law which suggest that a person could be found liable for cyberbullying. Regarding what you firstly mentioned, permit me to give you a personal advice. Where I come from, there is an adage which says that \u2018if you shut your eyes in hopes of preventing yourself from seeing a bad thing, you will still have your eyes shut when a good thing passes by'. So try your best to consciously keep on treating people with kindness regardless of preconceived ideas that you might have developed and encourage people around you to do likewise. Ultimately, believe me, you will get the right person. If you decide otherwise, you will simply cause suffering and attract the wrong people; and of course let us not forget Karma. And then again, the cycle of negativity towards both sexes will continue and these negative preconceived ideas will continue to exist and develop which will in turn affect our behaviour as a society. So, let us not act or treat people based on negative pre-programed societal ideas of who they might be.\n\nP.s: I am an activist for the No Hate Speech Movement for the Council of Europe, if you have ever been a target of hate speech online (or know anyone who has) please do share your experience with us on: http://blog.nohatespeechmovement.org/have-you-been-targeted-by-hate-speech-share-your-story/.

                    "commentText": "I agree with James but I guess I should flesh out why, this is too brief for a complex set of reasoning.\n\nThe premise of this talk is perfectly valid. Guys have said these things to Julia and she has every right to feel the way she does HOWEVER the conclusions drawn on this emotion I have a problem with. There are a few points:\n\n- The expectation that I modify MY speech is also reasonable but a double standard (nudging it in this context towards unreasonable territory). Julia admits that she has shut men down simply because of a generalised perception built on the demonstrated negative interactions with a few men. Following these rules means:\n-:- I must behave in a manner respectful of Julia as a person (I have no problem with this, I'd like to think I would do this anyway although I accept not all men would)\n-:- Julia can interact with ME as a generalisation of the attribute pertaining to the fact I am a man. My person hood is now irrelevant in context to me.\n\nThere are many industries in the big bad world where particular individuals of the female <b> gender </b>actually objectify themselves in order to ply money from individuals of the male<b>  gender</b>. The exposure of these industries are more prevalent then ever before and to all people of younger and younger ages. Also the online community is ever bigger leading to more men with less interaction with real people day to day.\n\nSo what you might ask. Julia uses the examples of the horrible interactions she has had with men to legitimise the generalisation behaviour of shutting them down before they talk with her. Could not these men use their experience of women (I am guessing from the disrespectful attitude that its mostly going to be from the industries mentioned before) to describe why they interact with Julia in the manner they do?\n\nI am not justifying this, all interactions should begin from a position of mutual respect in my opinion but it is equally disrespectful for me to be ignored for actions that are not my own. It seems to me that those men behave similarly but in reversed genders. \nThey respect men and objectify Women. Julia is respecting Women and objectifying Men.\n\n\n\n- The description o<b> f sexis</b>m being subconscious whilst being oblivious to the abo<b> ve sexi</b>sm in the form of the aforementioned double standard.\n\n\n\n- This one is inferred by me. It is circumstantial at best so feel free to dispute me on this but the percei<b> ved gen</b>der roles. Julia expects men she is interested in to approach her. Most of the preface describes scenarios where men are approaching women and during the role play Julia sets up she even states \"When your a man and you walk up to a lady in the bar and say hey. ((Well I guess this is how its done))\" which I infer to mean Julia does not approach men she is attracted to. I have noticed both Men and Women tend to fall into t<b> hese ge</b>nder roles if they do not actively keep themselves in check and maybe this is okay? Men and Women are equal but we are not the same, these two statements are not the same. 2+2=4, 1+3=4 both equate the same but are different functions, if you have to fight your nature THAT hard then maybe you are doing the wrong thing? It also leads in some respects to a particularly caustic outcome of SOME women expecting me to treat them equal except when it suits them. It happens.\n\nOn a side note to this inferred statement, I have spoken to Women at bars who have tried to hit on me (flipping the roles) and whilst the act of turning them down was not particularly hard, watching another persons face distort in pain is not a comfortable place to be. Also tends to be worse if you have known them for a spell, so I sorta get what that side of the table looks like. Additional in one occasion with a st<b> range </b>Woman she tried to ply m<b> e wi</b>th sex asking if \"I knew what it was like to have<b>  a rea</b>l Woman's legs wrapped around me, not just looking at porn.\" When I repeated my disinclination to pursue a relationship whilst admittedly withholding some additional disdain for such an aggressive approach (Would be ironic if I was an aggressive pursuer [I am not]) she then started breaking down my appearance. \"You would look better with a good haircut. I am a hairdresser, take my number and I will help you out.\" I declined again to be met with. \"He is <b> pro<b> b</b</b>>ably gay.\"\n\nN<b> o I<b>  </b</b>>am not gay, I just (shock horror) wasn't intere<b> sted i</b>n that Woman.\n\n\nFrom my experience there is a misunderstanding in parts of our culture between action and cause. Inappropriate actions are derived from \nmis-aligned values. Prescriptive behaviours is not the solution, this is simply rendering over a broken wall. Re-alignment of values will correct behaviour without needing to prescribe a set of behaviours, further it allows a person to adapt to a non-prescribed scenario avoiding the behaviour mentioned by Julia of \"running the checklist\" rather then analysis of the interaction against desired outcome.",

You ARE however obligated to be respectful. If the Men in Julia's video had of been respectful of Julia, she wouldn't have made this video. If Julia hadn't have been preachy about male behaviour whilst admitting being shitty to men for no other reason then they share the sa<b> me gend</b>er as some other asshole (effectively making Julia the asshole in context of the new guy) and being oblivious to this as the SAME disrespect manifest only slightly differently then I wouldn't have made MY comments.\n\nYou can generalise your behaviour towards men, or men as a category. When you do though you sacrifice the privilege to criticise men who have generalised you for your feminine qualities.To try to have it both ways is disrespectful of the men's rights (I can do this but you can't because your a man).",

                    "commentText": "+naaatsuki I don't get rejected that way because I have never approached that way. The implication in the video is that all men approach this way in a bar etc, its not true. I have rejected women who approach ME this way and they respond pretty much the same, they try to make a deal with you to convince you they are worth your time, when still rejected they flat out verbally attack you. I don't hold it against them.\n\nYou have to understand that being the first to move is scary as well, particularly for men. Society says we are stoic, never should we be weak, roll with the punches. That's the masculine way. You open yourself up to a stranger, effectively emotionally dropping your guard and they slap you back, you get an emotional response \"whats wrong with me? Why would I be rejected? I'm not a bad guy!!!\" then of course you cannot be sad, that is weakness the emotion changes to \"Who are you to reject me? How dare you judge me without getting to know me!!! I don't know what I saw in you anyway!!!\". This manifests differently particularly when friends are around because you CAN'T show weakness...\n\nFirst clue a human is hiding weakness is that they try to bring down someone around them (putting them in perceived power, giving control, giving strength). In this situation, you put them in the weak spot, you will be the focus to let them recover...\n\nIt's interesting I find that the female mindset is not much different. I have seen it first hand, they clearly went through the same <b> transition </b>against me, and this is why I cannot hold it against them. This destroy me for destroying you is simply human.\n\n\nIncidentally saying I am not interested because I don't feel safe near you is not the same as I am not interested in you because you are a man. That said if you always feel unsafe around men then there might be other issues you need to confront. There ARE bad guys out there (I wont lie), but there are levels of bad and in the western world it is VERY rare that a guy will flat out attack you.\n\nHumans are animals, so we men are animals too (as are women) but you must recognise we have higher cognitive function (just like you). Theoretically speaking if you wouldn't assault a man simply because you had the power, you must expect we are by and large the same. If you WOULD assault men if you had the power then again we might be dealing with a different problem.",

So 'legacy' rape is what should be looked at, statistically. \nMost modern 'rape' allegations seem to be false.  \nThe wor<b> ds 'sex</b>ual assault' or 'rape' these days means, 'latent hurt feelings' most of the time.

That's 0.025%. Can't be described as an epidemic using this figure can it?\nThese sort of rapes result from perpetrators with ser<b> ious me</b>ntal abnormality or illness and if you look, you'll find that<b>  such m</b>ental illness occurs in at least 0.3% of the population, 12 time<b> s more </b>common than rape.\nSo no amount of persecution of males and \"teaching males not to rape\" is going to stop rape of about 25 females per 100,000.\nAnd do remember, including the prison population, there are more of these crimes committed to males than females.",

Why shouldn't we do everything in our power, without infringing the rights of others, to guarantee the safety of people living in America? Is there something wrong with trying to protect people?",

Legacy rape has a clear and proper definition and occurrences are rare, as mentioned in this thread. Unfortunately the meaning of the word 'rape' has changed, it now usually means 'latent hurt feelings', or something equally trivial.\nThe Cosmonaut writes \"every accusation has to be treated as if it is legitimate\"  A <b> lame </b>statement ... just stating the obvious. The Cosmonaut makes retarded statements out of nowhere, such as \"rape is fine\" , demonstrating very low comprehension skills - try reading the thread, then quote what you are referring to, it might stop you from making a fool of yourself. \nRadical feminists want accusers to be believed even when<b>  sexual</b> assault accusations are obviously false, this is a problem for accused men. Feminist lobbyists, who want the law to favor women, have changed procedures so that charges o<b> f sexua</b>l assault do not have to be proven. This means that the accused must find hard evidence of innocence. Eg the video, 1cHZ8l44Y2U\nWhat we have these days are situations where many young men are being severely harmed by bogus charges from young women with a victim mentality disorder. Or bogus charges are sometimes supported by misandrist feminists who have positions of responsibility.\nEg videos, QzDGv8e-Cls and 7_hBlNHvvus\nDon't respond if you haven't watched the videos.

We've seen entertainment that has matured decades ago and yes sometimes a developer or director just wants to show sexy looks. This is true for men with exaggerated sixpacks just as much as a blonde girl with way too curvy features. There<b> 's nothi</b>ng fundamentally wrong with either. Each has their place. And yes, sometimes the characters aren't shallow characters either. Even worse, some movies pretending to do more justice to females, like the all-female Ghostbusters disaster, are completely ridiculously executed pieces of crap. Not funny, not engaging and those characters feel so incredibly forced. As for people who watch porn being often more pro feminists, I highly doubt it. I mean pro feminists as the nonsensical activism. Not a general feeling of appreciating women, which by the way most if not all men have anyway. It's <b> why sex</b>ism is a bs concept.

Since you're not a <b> woman,</b> you haven't experienced what problems we face as women. To shrug everything off as rubish because you haven't experienced it or can't understand it is honestly ignorant. And as a<b>  woman</b> myself, your definition of strong is very different than mine. Strong is not enforcing your will on others. Strong is not might makes right. Strong is not using your physical ability to hurt someone. That is weak. That is cowardice. Strong is sacrificing of yourself for someone else. Strong is laying aside your pride. Strong is putting others before yourself. That's strong, and that's kind, and that's what women want.",

Paradoxically enough, they are also very, very keen on exploiting the patriarchal values they pose to dismantle, in order to keep policing others' behaviors. \u2013 As is abundantly clear in this video. \u2013 Either way, I would watch my back, if I were you.\n\nLet's take another step back.\n\nWhat if the disgusting behavior you refer to doesn't stem from<b>  misogyny</b>. Think about it; i<b> f misogyn</b>y were an element, it would probably be the rarest one in the known universe. So maybe these guys react to the despicable behavior of t<b> he wom</b>an involved. Maybe the despicable behaviors of other women have already done their damage in these men. \n\nTHAT, dear friend, is the other side of the coin.\n\nSince you gave no specifics,, there's no way of knowing.

But don't be afraid, just become a male nurse. With the same qualifications and college fees as your female co-worker, you can expect to be paid on average an extra $6000 more annually than the female. If you can sit in your chair right now and say \"yes of course that is fair! I should be paid more than her!\"......then I question if you really know anything about our motives for equality at all.

But I am seeing plenty of women being treated like crap and like objects or simply something pretty to look at way to much in society.\n\nAh I see. So women are the only people that get treated like crap? Men are TOTALLY immune from that; women never cheat, file false rape or domestic abuse charges, or do stuff like clean out their partners in divorces. Thanks for reminding me that it's only women that 'get treated like crap'. Oh, and please define treated like crap while we're at it. Are you talking physical abuse? Or simply a guy simply sleeping with a girl and never calling her again? Define 'treated like crap' please.\n\nNo girl wants a man to love her only for her body, cuz guess what? That's not really love.\n\nWho said that? I'm talking about<b>  sexual</b> attraction NOT love, which for men is 99% physical. This is why men 'objectify' women, because attraction for us is all visual. We only care about your face, boobs, ass and body. Women hate this I know, because they like to think that that their achievements, their personality and their intelligence make them attractive. Ummm no. Those things make MEN attractive but it doesn't work the other way around, in fact for women they are often a turn off or a hindrance. Men don't care if you are a mute, illiterate room temperature IQ burger flipper at Mcdonalds so long as you look good. If you want to be attractive to a man it's simple - just look good, that's all we care about. Of course in any potential relationship there's going to be more needed to make it last, but we're not talking about that - we're talking about lust.  \n\nAnd I also see gold diggers, which is not good either.

If anyone is stereotyping, it's you, because you are putting all men into a category of only liking women for their looks. Many guys I know would be insulted by that, because I know a whole lot of really great guys who actually love women for who they are. And if they saw this comment right now, they'd be offended by the way you think, because not all guys are like that. If you only \"love\" someone for their body, you really don't love them, you love their body, and that's not what I'm talking about here. I'm talking about actual love and relationships, not merely lust. And it's fine if you find a <b> woman </b>physically beautiful, but that does not mean you get to objectify her, because guess what? She is a person, not a hunk of meat, whether you like to think so or not, and that means you must at least treat her with respect on the outside, even if you couldn't care less on the inside, because this is America and we all have rights here. And secondly, you stating that all that makes a<b>  woman</b> attractive is her body, welp, that's your opinion, and you're certainly entitled to it, frankly I don't think it's a good one, but hey, still your opinion. As long as you know not everyone agrees with that opinion, guys and girls alike. Just like I know girls who only like guys because they're hot. Thirdly, I was not calling you a gold digger, I simply said gold diggers exist. I'm not sure if you read that wrong, or you're just finding reasons to call me out. Fourthly, I know there are women who abuse men, and never said there weren't. I'm only saying the majority of abuses is men against women, and that's just a known fact. You're being willfully ignorant if you don't want to admit that. And lastly, I don't know why you find it so hard to believe I'm a Republican. Yes, Republicans can be civil people too.

Obviously if we're talking about sexuality and what makes you physically attracted to someone, then fine, but like I said, I'm not.\n\nWell actually you and me are because that is what 'objectification' is - sheer lust. So you are 'talking about it' actually, you brought it up.\n\nI'm talking about actual love. Some people want real relationships, not just hook ups. And I have no problems with being physically attracted to someone, obviously girls are physically attracted to guys as well, in case you didn't know.\n\nOnce again, YOU brought up this 'objectification' horsehit, and now you've you're talking about lurve? Make up your mind. Love and lust are two differet things, but this conversation started on objectification, which has <b> nothing </b>to do with love. \n\nWhat I'm saying is that is not the ONLY reason why you love someone. If I see a certain guy, the first thing I think might be that he's cute, just like if a guy sees a pretty girl the first thing he notices is probably her looks, because he doesn't know her at all. If I'm physically attracted to a guy, that might give me motivation to want to get to know him, but if I get to know him, and his personality is horrible, I instantly become turned off.\n\nAs above. You're talking about love but that's not what got you riled up in the first place. Which was, as I'll remind you now, 'objectification'\n\nI might still be attracted to his looks, because let's admit there's good looking people out there, but I don't love him and want to invest time in him. And I know all guys are not like that because I've seen guys that liked a girl because she was pretty, but then found out she was<b>  crazy</b>, and stopped trying to have a relationship with her.\n\nAgain, I'll repeat it for the 4th time - you brought up objectification and I have told you why men do it. Now, you've gone off on tangents about love.\n\nI know guys that want an actual relationship, not just a one night stand, because they've said that and not only said it, but shown it considering they haven't had a single girlfriend in two years and were pretty serious about it.\n\nAgain. Do I need to repeat this for a 5th time? You get the picture.\n\nSome people still only care about looks after all that, and that's why there's porn for both genders, men and women.\n\n6th time maybe?\n\nYou can think whatever you want in your head, but when it comes to treating a girl right, you can not dehumanize her, because you have to dehumanize someone to treat them poorly. And saying women cannot actually be attractive because of who they are and men can, is a load of bull. Yeah, props to you because you're a man and you want that to be true. And I'm still not a Bernie supporter, and I know other registered Republicans who agree with me, so whatever. Keep pretending you know everything about my life to tell me who I am.\n\nIf you're talking bullshit about 'objectification' then yes, you sound like your typical SJW blue-haired, ring nose<b> d obes</b<b> >e femina</b>zi. Objectification is looking a<b> t a wo</b>man and not giving a shit about her personality, just sheer lust for her looks. And that how men will approach every interaction with a female, at first anyways.\n\nNow, you're not incorrect in saying that men want relationships and so forth, of course this is true. But the very first thing we notice are your lo<b> oks, not</b>hing else. If we first meet you and you're attractive, you could<b>  be a</b<b> > dea</b>f d<b> umb an</b>d blind homeless person but if you've a nice ass, face and boobs, that's all we notice. Do you honestly think this isn't true? I remember an ex-girlfriend hated that whenever she met a man for the first time (and she included me in this) they would all (quite  obviously) look her up and down, and stare at certain parts of her body. She hated this, but eventually came to accept that that's how men are. \n\nYou see, women aren't like this when it comes to men, they value a whole host of factors when it comes to our attractiveness - like our personality, charm, intelligence, status, career, and looks of course. They get pissed off when their criteria isn't reciprocated, because what turns on women is different to what turns men's on. \n\nHowever with men none of these are important, not initially. They are important if we decide to stick around and have a relationship, BUT NOT initially. \n\nThis is where men and women differ. Is this clear? Do you see why I have such a problem with this 'objectification' bullshit, because you are shaming men for their natural instincts when it comes to how they view women? They will never change, and I suggest you deal with it.",

A<b>  woman</b>'s personality doesn't make his dick hard. \n\nI know friends who are dating that initially, the guy did not like the girl physically, but were attracted to something in her personality, like she was really fun to be around, friendly, etc. Later on as the friendship went on, he grew to love that girl and be physically attracted to her too, although at first it ha<b> d nothin</b>g to do with that.

This is how men are, regardless of how you THINK your male buddies behave. If a man says he's attracted to her personality you can best believe he's saying it to be politically correct in front o<b> f a wo</b>man. In fact, I've said the same thing myself many's a time. It means jack shit.\n\nBut believe me, if you were a fly on a wall when men get together to talk about women you can be sure none of them are talking about women's 'personalities'\n\nAgain, if you want to be this metaphorical 'fly on the wall' I suggest you listen to Tom Leykis.

Being physically attracted to someone is not objectification, or else we'd all be objectifying each other all the time. I think you know that. Objectification is treating someone like they're only worth something for how their genetics happen to shape their face. As if they are not a person with rights, but simply an object, a tool for you to use. That's objectification if you somehow didn't know that all this time.\n\nWell, in my book eyeing someone up and lusting after them 100% for their looks IS objectification. I am looking at her in one way only - I don't care about anything else but her looks and I want to have<b>  sex</b> with her. Is that objectification? If so, should I feel guilty? \n\nA tool for me to use? So if I sleep with someone because she's hot, and I never call her again I've objectified her?\n\nI get a porn mag and I jerk off to a hot girl I'm 'objectifying' her?

I said that you view things solely as a female, and have no interest in how men look at things. I've been trying to explain this to you but you don't want to know.

You satisfied with your minute world view which consists of how a few of your beta-male friends behave, and think that's the be all and end all.\n\nso loving people for who they are is the worst kind of projection? Interesting how you see things. I know a lot of guys who would disagree with that if I showed them this comment. And you can say they're all liars because that's what someone who's losing an argument does, but you have no proof that every single guy I know is a liar, considering you don't know any of them, so\u2026\n\nNo, projection means you think your pov is everyone elses. Again, guys will say a lot of things when talking to a female so I wouldn't put much currency in that. Your basic point is that men aren't just attracted visually or looks wise to women, that there lots of men who can get an erection by virtue of her personality alone.\n\nYour proof of this is a handful of your mangina friends who will most likely tell you what you want to hear. My proof is the multi trillion dollar porn industry which clearly proves this is nonsense. I think it's fair to say YOU are losing the argument there sweetcheeks.\n\nso you would be willing to divorce someone over their weight? Does that sound good and right to you? Honestly, does it? Because anyone who can justify that i<b> s blin</b>d and selfish. And no, definitely not all guys are like that because I have family members who put on some weight and the guy didn't divorce them, and they're still together...so\n\nAbsolutely. Again, tell me how I am supposed to get an erection when I'm faced with a bag of blubber? Yes, you're right not all guys are like that. They are what's known as beta males or manginas who don't have the guts to tell their wife to hit the gym. If they had the balls they would. Not surprised that guy didn't divorce them. He's no doubt afraid of getting taken to the cleaners by his wife in any settlement.",

Its a totally one sided view of the world that has no interest in even learning how I and other men might view things. You literally couldn't give a shit - your way way is all that matters.\n\nso guys who treat women with respect are beta males?

In my personal experience there's not been a need to \"stand up to\" women who behave in similar ways because the men they've objectified were unlikely to leave the encounter feeling threatened or harmed. We are equal, but we are not the same. A group of women cat-calling or aggressively pursuing the average man are not going to make him feel attacked. But a group of men - or even an individual man - cat calling or aggressively pursuing the average <b> woman </b>often tends to have a different impact on women (for the most part). So, to consider your acid test, when I've been around female friends of mine, harassing or just objectifying men I need only remind them of their complaints when guys have done the same to them. \n\nIdeally we would get to a place where men and women could feel equally comfortable and secure in such situations and I reckon that would be better facilitated if we could all work to intuitively see and respect boundaries wherever they are.",

No one is the other alike even if there are science and stats of certain norms.. for guys to look for beautiful women more than other characteristics could surely be a norm, just as there could be a norm for girls to look more for brains or money than for appearance in men...\n\nEveryone knows equality isn't in our world, if it were... we wouldn't see the enormous talk about this all over the world.... and that you are defending yourself as a man, even though no one is saying that men aren't sexualized, objectified,  abused and so on as well.., that's really sad because you don't even realize that you are trying to silence one of societys yet biggest problems with your own problem...\n\nIf you wanna talk about equal rights for men, obviously it would be more accepted and listened to if you didn't go and try to use that to silence the topic of equal rights for women.......  It's really heartbreaking seeing men trying to justify in this way whenever it's about equal rights for women, because there's <b> nothing </b>to even defend...? but if you really would have to defend yourself as a man it would be when MODERN FEMINISM is accuring. \n\nYou have actually been talking about modern feminism a bit in your comments before here and to use those words surely you would know all about what it means right...? and the difference it stands for compared to the original Feminism... But yet everything you have said so far speaks against the original feminism... \n\nLet me remind you.. Feminism stands for Equality... yet you said you are tired of it... which means you are not really an \"equalist\" as some of you people here rather prefer calling it.. You are practically just being a real bully...  Also being hateful and using expletives whenever trying to get your opinion heard isn't gonna help you at all... nor is it gonna help to change the awful things you want to change in our society, believe me I know.... \n\nJust please..  be a little more loving, caring, open, understanding and that's really all you need, because believe it or not...as a<b>  woman</b>... that's really all I need from a man....",

Only feeds the claim that people get butthurt when ever they even hear others talk up about the issues which they themselves believe to be irrelevant or which \"shouldn't have such a fuss made about 'em\", issues which seem to subconsciously make them feel threatened. Why else would you lash out without any substance?

We are only treating the symptoms, & NOT the cause.

It was thought that these sort of things only happened to women, & due to her low societal position, this was taken as an insult to the male complex if he were to experience this, since he was (& still is) expected to be an unwavering, emotionless figure of power & strength. If u were to report your incident, chances r ur male & female colleagues would resort to calling u a \"crybaby\" & to \"man up\", further dehumanizing u as they have been conditioned by a culture rife with toxic masculinity.

I will raise my voice with yours and help you break free from oppression, just don't imply that I am part of the problem, that I opress you or anything like it just because that's what you have learned from your toxic ideology. Majority of men are not against you, we don't hate you, and we need you. We just would not let you talk shit about us based on a stupid ideology that tells you we are your enemy.",

This happens at varying degrees, but the human brain can develop an understanding of meaning behind what is said given the context of the situation in which the thing is being said.\nOn \"I'd like to fuck you in the ass whilst grabbing your tits.\"\nThat phrase does have several meanings given a certain context. Obviously, in the context of your sentence, the phrase means: a set of words used to describe a behavior I believe to be certainly defined and applicable in only a particular way.\nIn the context of my sentence, the phrase means: a set of words used as a quote in order to show that the meaning of the phrase has variance.\nThe meaning is clear in the context of an attractive person walking by, and someone said,\" I'd like to fuck you in the ass whilst grabbing your tits.\"\nIn the context of poetry \"I'd like to fuck you in the ass whilst grabbing your tits.\" has an array of meaning. Perhaps the poet is trying to portray a sense of strong, animalistic-type love for their partner. Perhaps the poet is trying to portray aggressive lust. Perhaps the poet is trying to portray a sense of sting to a lover they'd like to show disdain to. Perhaps the poet is trying to portray a sense of hedonism and the unfulfilling life therein. Perhaps the poet is trying to portray a sense of incapability to break the bonds of biological programming. Perhaps...perhaps...perhaps...\n(So I suppose I just argued how \"I'd like to fuck you in the ass whilst grabbing your tits.\" does have multiple meanings)\nThis is why people like Menace exist, those that disagree with PC-policing.\nFor more tangible examples that was used by the speaker (you):\n\"So shes a games journalist... she must give real good head to her editor\"\nPresumably, the context invokes the meaning that the person disagrees with the ethical integrity of the person under criticism with regards to their journalistic career.\n\"British slut\"\nThe meaning of the statement can be derived from the context of the situation. Perhaps the person under criticism was cheating on their partner with a string of lovers, playing each person like a fiddle, destroying the lives and relationships of a fair amount of people, all so that the person could get a top position at the corporation they worked at. Or perhaps the person under scrutiny fucked her partners sister, father, mother, and son; lied about it, then proceeded to shame the person cheated on for kissing some girl when they got a bit too drunk the night before. \n\nSo yes, the PC solution is not a good one to support. Why?\nBecause you prevent a poet from expressing their thoughts about their life and publishing it; you prevent the truly disgraceful (relative to your definition of disgraceful) from behaving in such a way that warrants mockery; you prevent sarcasm from boiling the misjudgment of idiocy;  you prevent disdain to those that are distasteful; you prevent etc...\nFor people that say stuff that you find stupid, then your best solution is to not care and tell them to fuck off (or some variant of this sort). But more often than not, people's intentions are more than naught; therefore, consider the possibilities and don't be so sensitive.",

Whilst there are cases of female to male rape they are a tiny fraction of the cases of <b> sexual </b>assault and rape for women. Therefore an aggressive comment from a man has more weight and meaning. A threat like that from a<b>  woman</b> is generally unthreatening. I don't think there are many men who worry about getting sexually assaulted by women on the way home. Whereas in the reverse most women are. Mainly because most of us have experienced some kind of unwanted attention that is borderline/is scary by men. Even if there are women who are sexualising this YTer, the threat level and meaning is very different.",
