        "postText": "A Tennessee detective has defended a sermon he gave calling for gay people to be executed by the government.', 'Grayson Fritts, who leads the ultra-conservative All Scripture Baptist Church in Knox County, was repeatedly heard claiming police and government should enforce Leviticus 20:13.', 'It reads: \u2018You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.\u2019', 'During a sermon, which was uploaded to Facebook before being taken down, he said the government should be able to arrest and put members of the LGBTQ community on trial to convict them.', 'If convicted they should then be executed, Fritts claimed.', 'He then said that it should be the \u2018responsibility\u2019 of the police to carry \u2018these things out\u2019.', 'Fritts also said riot vans need to be deployed to pride parades to arrest those who attend.', 'During his outburst, he also likened gay people to murderers and rapists, branding them as \u2018filthy animals\u2019.', 'However, he has claimed his views have not hindered his ability to perform his duties in the police force and is still refusing to apologise.', 'He told reporters: \u2018It\u2019s totally separate, because if I\u2019m employed by the sheriff\u2019s office, then if they came into the sheriff\u2019s office, obviously they\u2019re allowed there.', '\u2018You understand what I\u2019m saying? I am the head of this church. I say who comes and goes.', '\u2018Those people are not permitted to join, those people are not permitted to attend.\u2019', 'Fritts resigned earlier this month and is on paid sick leave until his resignation takes effect.', 'Prosecutors in Tennessee have said they are now looking into his work to see if there is any evidence of bias.', 'Tom Spangler, a Knox County sheriff, said although he was upset over his colleague\u2019s comments, he was reluctant fire him over fears of a backlash.",
