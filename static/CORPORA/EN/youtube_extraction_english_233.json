        "postText": " This might surprise you, but according to the U.S. government, I'm considered white. That's because, on the U.S. census, there's no option for Middle Eastern or North African, or MENA Americans. That means while we don't always have the same resources as some other minority groups, we still face a lot of the same struggles.\u00a0. . I like to think of it as 'white without the privilege.'. . Initially, in 1944, MENA Americans were overjoyed when the government ruled to legally identify them as 'white.' That's probably because, up until 1952, only 'white Americans' were able to become U.S. citizens.. . So, here we are, all these years later, and folks from the Middle East and North Africa still don't have their own American identity. That could change in the next census.. . Which might mean, for the first time, we'll actually know how many MENA Americans there are. Right now, estimates range from\u00a01.5 million\u00a0to\u00a03.6 million, and some experts even think it's closer to\u00a06 million.. . SEE MORE:\u00a0Black And Muslim \u2014 A Complicated Identity. . What most people don't realize is that the majority of the Middle Eastern population in the U.S. is\u00a0actually Christian,\u00a0and many of them want to continue identifying as white.. . That makes adding a MENA bubble on the census kind of controversial.. . Some people are also worried that the clarity of the demographic data will make it easier for law enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security to target certain neighborhoods or communities.\u00a0. . There's a good chance that MENA Americans will no longer have to classify as white after 2020, but we won't know until 2018, when Congress votes on the final census.. . So, do you think the census represents you? Let us know.. . This video includes images from Getty Images and clips from\u00a0Encyclopaedia Britannica. Music provided courtesy of APM Music.. .

            "commentText": "The reason why Arabs or people of MENA decent are considered white is because when they first began immigrating here, which they have been immigrating here for only a little over 100 years (1870/90-now modern day) they were considered 'Syrians of Asiatic birth' because during this time 'Upper Syria' which consisted of modern day Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Palestine was apart of the Ottoman Empire. In the United States, the only way to be classified as 'white' was to be European. Now may I add, because for a long time, MENA people were considered 'Asian,' at this time white American people thought Asians were trying to steal their jobs. So the government created 'Anti-Asian Laws' which constricted immigration from East Asia (China and Japan) but it also affected people from the Middle East. Furthermore, immigration in the United States throughout history has only favored Northern and Western Europeans. While Southern and Eastern Europeans were discriminated against for not being considered white like Italians for example. So the immigrants of MENA decent community sued the government to be considered white and equal. They won; and ever since then we have been considered white. Now, the Middle East is a admixture of races and ethnicities. No <b> ethnicity </b>has one phenotype. They're are<b>  black</b> Arabs<b> , blac</b>k Persian<b> s, bla</b>ck Turks. Just like there's olive complexed to brown Arabs, Persians, and Turks. There's also 'white' fair skinned people. This is all due to the fact, that the Middle East is the crossroads of the world. We sit in the middle of all of Asia, Africa, and Europe. So all those continents we will affect phenotypic features. The Middle East is unique in this aspect. Understand, 'white people' who are stereotypically 'racist' and white supremacists, are usually Anglo-Saxon and believe the Anglo-Saxon wh<b> ite r</b>ace is the supe<b> rior </b>race. This is why Southern and Eastern European were discriminated against, because they're not Anglo-Saxon. However, after a certain amount of time coming from Europe, they were welcomed as 'white' but some were still discriminated against. MENA people in the United States, while on paper were called 'white' they're history in the United States is a long one of discrimination and not being welcomed by the average white American people. Being seen as too 'backwards, savage, and not quite white.' MENA people played a role in the Civil Rights Movement and were suffered from run-ins with the KKK. The sad truth is even though we were considered 'white,' like Italians and other Eastern and Southern Europeans, we were never quite welcomed like the other Europeans eventually became. Part of it is sure, on average MENA people may not look 'white' but even the fairer skinned MENA individuals were classified as inferior. Most people believe 9/11 was the upbringing of struggle for MENA people and Muslim community but our history in the United States hasn't necessarily been a welcoming, pleasant one. 9/11 was just the 'cherry on top' for our community to be further pushed and not welcomed.",

Personally, without the hijab id see this<b>  woman</b> as just another tanned white women, it actually looks like she got <b> a ta</b>n for this video too IMO. I have greek friends who look mo<b> re ethn</b>ic and olive than any syrian, lebanese, israeli, or even iranian ive met. I practice Farsi with Iranis, some who look whiter than me, some who look easily less so, while i am of west euro descent; id like to have darker skin though, i guess like other americans lol. Honestly though, it doesnt matter what people identify as to me, as long as they treat me and others the same and arent identitarian or \"proud\" of the<b> ir \"ethnic</b>ity\". I find theres a minority of activists in the US, a lot from the levant, rather than the brownish khaleej, who seem to despise being seen as white when they look it, same with a lot of jews, I dont know why. I guess there are surely trump supporters who wouldnt want to be grouped with \"those muslims\" on the census as well. It would be best if the census stopped asking ab<b> out \"</b>race\" altogether though, if you go back not too far, the africans, caucasians, east asians, australians and others were all the same tribe, and we all have almost the same DNA. In fact just because you look a certain way, thats only like a handful of alleles that decide looks, a german could be more genetically-close to some kenyans than to some brits.",

The <b> racism </b>and hatred we experience here in the States 95% of the time come from white people, why on earth would we want to be associated with people who absolutely hate and despise us? No, thank you. I, like a significant number of Arabs, most certainly do not, nor will I ever, identify or even associate myself with the white<b>  race</b>. I'm pretty white (skin color) and call myself brown because I want to associate myself with what Arabs are stereotypically thought to be (even if I personally don't fit that image) and don't want to associate myself with whiteness (I got laughed at once for doing that btw). Even not taking into account the reason I gave above, at the end of the day, you can't separate Arabs into 'a part of the whit<b> e rac</b>e' and 'not a part of the whi<b> te ra</b>ce' based on skin color alone. Me and my sister are white (in skin color) and my two younger brothers are very dark (Ar<b> abs </b>tan really well), so what, are me and my sister a part of<b>  one </b>race and my two brothers a part of a diff<b> erent</b> race? Because that's very<b> , very </b>common with Ar<b> abs.</b> We tan so well that those of us who stay in the sun end up several shades darker than what our skin color actually is. So, what? We're classifying people based on the skin color we see when for Arabs it literally changes every time we're in the sun? Come on now. What k<b> ind o</b>f a race changes depending on what season you're in, in the winter you're white, in the summer, you're not. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.",

And it doesnt matter what you associate yourself with and that you \"stereotypically\" want to associate yourself with arabs, if you wanna use that logic, albanians arent white either since we're not stereotypically like western white people. But that logic is stupid. Anybody who has caucasian features and has skin that is light enough in color, is a white person. Period. If you committed a crime and the cops would ask witnesses \"what did he look like\" people would literally describe your skin color, your haircolor and clothes, and what do you think they would say? \"Oh he looked white but he might have been from Saudi Arabia\"? NO, they would just say he was white. Yeah you got laughed at because people thought it was silly, youre not brown if you dont look brown. Also how the fuck can you b<b> e racis</b>t to arabs? You aint no separa<b> te ra</b>ce, arabs are a group of people, no<b> t a r</b>ace, arabs belong to the caucasian group and so do europeans, yall just look different because of the extreme heat, your color is designed to handle the sun over there.

            "commentText": "A history lesson  to all the fake neandertal  caucasian Arabs you are not Arabs you will never be Arabs \nAll this modern fake Arabs are Caucasian. They certainly don't resemble the Arabs of Muhammed's (pbuh)time besides having many significant cultural differences. Real Arabs in Yemen, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, tribes are still <b> black </b>or near<b>  black</b> in colour, the other fake Arabs are Syrians/ Turks or Iranians  Caucasians. The modern fake Arabians are not ancien<b> t blac</b>k Arabians so what is the purpose lying about your identity when you put white on forms you are correct because you are Caucasians who hijacked t<b> he bla</b>ck Arabs identity. You have much more Slavic, Syrian, Turkish and Iranian ancestry then you do Arabian ancestry. The Quraysh and Kenani are still living in Hadromt  in Yemen, Ethiopia / Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan Israel. Do you even know what the Kenaani of the Hijaz still look like?\n\nWhy the heck do you think so many Syrians / Turkic called the Canaanites and Nabataeans and other Ar<b> abs bl</b>ack and cursed throughout history. Or perhaps you are not aware of this! Is it because they looked like Syrians, Persians or Turks ?!\n\nIF you are an uneducated historically and have no knowledge of self, then you would do better to read real history and keep your  Aryanist worshipping, white-washed attitude to your stupid self. Better yet purge yourself of it and  fear of blackness because I don't want any real Arab darker than you to face your kind of negative energy and ignorance. One of the reasons I focus on <b> this b</b>lack stuff is because people like you around the world have been going around for centuries pretending to be more worthy of living<b>  than </b>black skinned people who brought you your religion(s).\nIf you don't know what the Arabs looked like and you are not aware of the many descriptions of the Azd and Quraysh and Canaani and in fact the Arabian tribes in general as<b>  being</b> black <b> and je</b>t black in color and holding a fair skin in contempt -then it is your job to read about them and disprove it.\n\nYou should at least attempt to disprove that the words 'shadeed al udma' and 'adam' and 'akhdar' meant people the color of a sub-Saharan Africans for Arab writers!. Disprove the 9th century king of grammarians al Mubarrad (otherwise known as Ibn Berry) of the Azd clan said the Arabs 'took pride in their blackness' and had a contempt for fair complexion because it was 'the color of slaves'. Disprove that 9th century al -Jahiz of Iraq claimed the Sulaym and all of the tribes of the volcanic region of el har<b> ra wer</b>e 'black as the lava' and taking white concubines. Disprove that al Dhahabi the Syrian of the 14th century who travelled through the Hijaz claimed that most in Arabs the Hejaz were 'dark brown' in colour and that they considered fair skin synonymous with the colour of slaves of Persians and Syrians. Disprove that the European colonialists visiting the Kaa'b, Uqayl and Khaza'il other tribes of Beni Amer ibn Za'za'a from Hawazin bin Mansur claimed that they w<b> ere 'n</b>ear black' and the complexion of Oromo Ethiopians and wore greased plaits in their hair like SO MANY OTHER ARABIANS. Disprove that ibn Athir the Kurd didn't claim the Sulaym ibn Mansur was of extreme blackness because they were from ' pure Arabs'. Disprove that tribes like the modern Anayzah and Shammar originally from Yemen settled among the white Syrians and mixed with them and then move back into Saudi Arabia after the 16th century. Disprove that the individuals in the gulf from aristocratic families have last names al Turki and Al Farsi because they are descended in part from Turks and Iranians in recent times. Disprove that Saudis were not enslaving and trading in women from Armenia, Georgia and the Caucasus and passing them around up until the 1960s. Disprove that the Yemen and Mecca wasn't inhabited by large numbers of Turks and the Iranians settled in the Yemen in large numbers among Arabs whose leaders often called themselves al Aswad. Disprove that Morocco Qahtan tribes were not originally from the pure Maqil from the Yemen, Sulaym, Hilal and Quraysh and that these same tribes entering Syria, Iraq, North Africa and Spain were originally des<b> cribed</b> as '<b> black'</b> and 'black as pitch' by Syrians iraqis and Spaniards. Disprove that most Qahtani in the Yem<b> en are s</b>till African in appearance like the Mahra, Shahra and Qara and claiming to have come from remote times from Africa and that many of them still have 'fuzzy hair'. Disprove that early Syrians did not describe the early confederation of Ismaelites including Nabit, Kedar as 'Kusi' or Kusim and that this word did not signify blackness. Disprove that Morocco is not the land in which were brought in millions of European slaves even in the Turkish era . Disprove that although Moroccans<b>  look </b>down on black complexion today that the Moors in Spain were largely Arabians of the Azd, Kuda'ah. Qays, and Madhij and that these clans were AL<b> L desc</b>ribed as black and nappy and kinky haired people that considered fair -skin the color of slaves. Disprove that the Moorish tribes described at Tours fighting against Charles Martel described in Europeans texts as 'blacker than the blackes ink' were not of the Azd, Husayn! Disprove that several Syrian and Iraqi scholars called the Khazraj and Aus of the Ansar descendants of th<b> e Azd </b>extremely black, tal<b> l a<b> n</b</b>>d 'huge with red eyes' and 'nappy hair' and that one of their leaders Ubada bin Samit of the Salim bin Auf clan of the Khazraj did not say that he would bring in thousands of tribal brethren w<b> ith hi</b>m into Egypt black as himself when speakin<b> g t<b> o</b</b>> the Byzantine 'red' compexioned Copt in Egypt who feared Ubadah's appearance. Disprove that the Arab linguists did not say in their texts that t<b> he <b> wor<b> d</b</b</b>>>s<b>  white</b>, green yellow and black were u<b> sed by</b> the A<b> rabs o</b>nly for black men or black men whose complexion was brownish enough to see that that it was free of blotchiness.\n\nDisprove that early physical anthropologists found the early inhabitants of Arabia to be similar to those of East Africans and people of Nubia.And, disprove that the culture of ancient Southern Arabia was not closely linked to that o f the Horn of Africa and Nubia according to modern archeology.\n\nWhen you or a single on of the billions of people on this plane have disproved a single one of these facts Husayn then I will say you have made your case.",

Arabs are people from yemen and they spread to saudi and the gulf states even to the levant but thats where greek, roman and arab culture mixed. Our foods are not alike, we speak a distinct levantine arabic and We dont dress like them. I think the united nations fucked us by splitting our countries the way it is now. Borders are made based off religion and culture. the two most religions that are conflicted are the sunni and shias. A quarter of northeast syria and 3/4 of iraq should have been giving to the shias. palestine and lebanon should have joined; the jews and christians could have lived with us because they were already there anyways. Jordan should have been with saudi. That way noway war would of broke out. Also there are the kurds in that northern part of iraq, iran, and turkey.",

Which is mainly the Middle East is the center point of the Arab World. \nThe skin color varies from white t<b> o ta</b>n <b> to bla</b>ck and these people are basically Arabs. \nYou have to understand that the Middle East is <b> the transit</b>ion point in between the West and the East and the North Africans. Being in the center you have access to all the nations easier than the rest of the neighbors. So for many thousands of years the Arab World has been interacting with the rest of the region. \n\nYou would be surprised, to see and hear a blonde with blue eyes who is an Arab and speaks Arabic fluently. \n\nYou would also be surprised to see and hear a N<b> orth Afr</b>ican who looks completely brown skinned, who is an Arab and speaks Arabic fluently. Found in counties like (Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Morocco) In the continent of Africa.   \n\nYou would also see an Arab person who has the features of an east European who looks more likely, Turkish, Italian, Greek, Belgium ... and those Arabs are located right in the center of the Middle East like Lebanon, Syria, Palestine. In the continent of West Asia. \n\nYou would also see the typical dark skinned Arabs but not too dark li<b> ke an Af</b>rican, the features a<b> re not A</b>frican more c<b> lose to</b> Indian . \nAnd they are found in countries like (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Iraq) These countries are in the east continent of Asia.",

They needed to be consistent in thei<b> r racis</b>m because they are now using brown people at the bottom of the next super power (Israel) to fight, but if you look at the top rabbis and leaders of Israel they are white-white, not brownish white mix.

Be thankful you are pretty bec<b> ause ra</b>cist are hypocrites when it comes to women because they are carnal and subject to their own lust while discriminating.

For example,  as evident in that plot, Iranians are actually more similar to European Azeris and people of Turkey, with considerable genetic overlap.  But you do find a lot of individual outlying Iranians, with genetic affiliations to Indian/Pakistanis or Arabs, and that has become the typecast Iranian, which has prevailed in the media; giving people globally a stronger impression that Iranians are not white .  However, the modal type of Iranian is easy to confuse with it's Euroepan neighbors.",

These were mostly enslaved Turkic peoples, Egyptian Copts, Circassians, Abkhazians, and Georgians.Wikipedia\n\nQuote\"Ghilman were introduced to the Abbasid Caliphate during the reign of al-Mu'tasim (r. 833\u2013842), who showed them great favor and relied upon them for his personal guard. ((((((The ghilman were slave-soldiers taken as prisoners of war from conquered regions or frontier zones, especially from among the Turkic people of Central Asia and the Caucasian peoples)))))) (Turkish: K\u00f6lemen). They fought in bands, and demanded high pay for their services.[1] They were opposed by the native Arab population, and riots against the ghilman in Baghdad in 836 forced Mu'tasim to relocate his capital to Samarra. The ghilman rose rapidly in power and influence, and under the weak rulers that followed Mu'tasim, they became king-makers: they revolted several times during the so-called \"Anarchy at Samarra\" in the 860s and killed four caliphs. Eventually, starting with Ahmad ibn Tulun in Egypt, some of them became autonomous rulers and established dynasties of their own, leading to the dissolution of the Abbasid Caliphate by the mid-10th century.\n\nA Ghulam was trained and educated at his master's expense and could earn his freedom through his dedicated service. Ghilman were required to marry Turkic slave-women, who were chosen for them by their masters.[2] Some ghilman seem to have lived celibate lives. The absence of family life and offspring was possibly one of the reasons why ghilman, even when attaining power, generally failed to start dynasties or proclaim their independence. The only exception to this was the Ghaznavid dynasty of Afghanistan.\n\nThe Ottomans and various Iranian dynasties (Safavid, Afsharid, Qajar) drew its peoples generally from the Balkans and the Caucasus\"",

                    "commentText": "Good girl.  I noticed the official MENA category is stripped of Turks, Kurds, Europes Azeri, or Afghans. So with the peculiar exclusion of these neighbors, MENA is deceptively just an ARAB category, however, the term \"Middle-East-North <b> African,</b> gives the impression it represents a greater racial-cultural sphere.  So when they designed MENA based on self-response of different groups, t's easy to imagine how Israelis and Iranians felt coerced into selecting MENA over WHITE or OTHER, as they imagined it to be some generalization of the greater Middle East.  Johnny Tehranian and Morad Ghorban, charlatans, who pretend to serve deep Iranian interests, did absolutely<b>  nothing</b> to appeal this fact, at the 2015 Census Bureau meetings. And keep in mind, checking MENA will not make your life easier.  First of all, Iranians are not exactly the type to milk public welfare anyway (with household incomes twice that of Americans), and nowadays Federal laws protect all citizens against racial/ethnic discrimination, so an oppressive level of discrimination (ie; severe employment discrimination to the point of bankruptcy) is completely unrealistic; in other words, their will never be a Federal budget to provide a significant MENA welfare to Iranians and others in the MENA category anyways-  it won't be necessary. The only thing checking MENA does is conform to backwoods ideology, that Iranians belong with Arabs.  You are right with respect to Iranian genetic affiliation, as revealed by this high resolution, 1 Million SNP, PCA with global populations:   [LINK]     It's clear that Iranians true nearest relatives are people of Turkey, Azeris of Europe, and to a lesser extent Armenians.  Iranians are just an extension of the Caucaus groups, and on a continuous cline from Europe - so Iranians are genetically white, though at the threshold of whiteness, where eyeballing 'whiteness' is doomed to fail.   Perhaps,  it's fairer to say the modal Iranian type is white, because Iran is diverse enough and introduced a lot of foreign elements among individuals, so that there are quite a few outliers (like the one circled i<b> n r<b> e</b</b>>d on that PCA).",

The only reason they make us check white and this is a fact is because first arab settlers in America were from Lebanese decent which from all the arabs they tend to look more white with smaller features so they didn't know what to label them so they decided white. Look at the ancient Egyptians they were<b>  not b</b>lack they looked just arabs from the gulf. That's why to this day they can't determine<b>  what</b> race they would have been. They features are distinctive with sharp noses and big eyes with slender jaw lines. So you can not say blackforparents when in reality the continent of Africa is not like I sa<b> id all</b> black. Im from yemen i will say that we have some afro blood and I don't deny it but I'm more arab then anything and im far from white. Just like alot of africans have middleeastern blood or other but claim they are th<b> ere o</b>wn race.",

Some European genetics are also negligible and came in waves for thousands of years. But the core population, which has been there for 40,000 to 50,000 years, came via a back migration from Eurasia (and carried Neanderthal DNA). Also, the most comprehensive study on 16 ancient Egyptian mummies revealed that all of them were most closely related to populations of modern day Jordan and Syria. Let me know if you'd like me to link you to studies.",

Notice how all the tall bridged nose,huge eyes,<b> colored </b>eyes and hair and sharp features are all placed under \"Caucasian\" even though Arabs look<b>  nothing</b> like white Europeans. Arabs have aware and one of a kind,specific face features. The rest were placed unde<b> r Mongoloi</b>d or Negroid. Bullshit. You wanna tell me Indians are \"white\" or \"Caucasian\" even though majority of them are brown skinned or lean on the darker skin spectrum? Bullshit,bullshit and more bullshit. Never trust a white devil's words. They've colonized everything to the point where everyone subconciously believes only their words are \"right\" word<b> s. Color</b>ed hair and eyes aren't a white or European specific features. Arabs and Turks can have differ<b> ent colo</b>red hair and eyes. Doesn't mean they're white or caucasian. There are Arabs and Turks who lean on the lighter skin spectrum? Doesn't mean they're white or caucasian. See? White European isn't the def<b> ault </b>race so the whole need to stop relating every little thing back to them. I don't care. Arabs are asians and fall unde<b> r the mong</b>oloid category. Not all asians look alike. Arabs are their own kind of asians. Plus,asians are diverse an<b> d eac</b>h race of asians have their own different,special,unique and specific look to them. Like East Asi<b> ans and</b> Indian for example. Very different looking but both are still asians. One of these asians are Arabs. I would include Turks too but they hate asians and want to join the European league. Ehh,their choice.",

That's because Western civilization was built on Roman civilization. The West still sees itself as Rome's successor, which is why it would view a Christian Middle East as subservient to the West. \n\nThey wouldn't treat Christian middle easterners like whites though, just like they don't treat Christian Hispanics like whites.",

My cousin who is half Arab definitely sees himself as white.Anthropologically speaking,  Iranians, many Arabs, Kurds, Armenians, and so forth would fall under the Mediterranean branch of the Caucasian AKA white<b>  race</b>. This  leads me to another point.  Americans of Middle Eastern ancestry in fact fought in the courts decades ago partly on anthropological grounds  to legally be classified as white.  Arab Americans have suffered discrimination, but overall, Arab Americans do extremely well in this country.  All you have to do is examine the lives of people like Ralph Nader, John Abizaid, and so forth.  Creating a separate MENA classification would lead to more stereotyping and discrimination against this community.  Some have suggested that Hispanics since th<b> e ethni</b>c category of Hispanic was created back in the '70s that they have been stereotyped even worse.Ultimately on the next census, I'm checking the some oth<b> er ra</b>ce box and putting American.

The original conception of Caucasoid, in 1785, by Christoph Meiners, included a broad array of peoples, and has , in fact, since been supported through high resolution genetic studies, like this 1 million PCA plot https://twitter.com/ztech1979/status/934556232962203648  But Genetics does not support MENA, as it is currently defined.  For example,  as evident in that plot, Iranians are actually more similar to European Azeris and people of Turkey, with considerable genetic overlap  (note the position of Turks and Iranian on continuous cline from Europeans).  But you do find a lot of individual outlying Iranians, with genetic affiliations to Indian/Pakistanis or Arabs, and that has become the typecast Iranian, which has prevailed in the media; giving people globally a stronger impression that Iranians are not white .  However, the modal type of Iranian is often easy to confuse with it's European neighbors.",

Science/technology was a choice by man imposed upon humans whether they agreed with it or not. The facts are that science/technology is a man-made concept that was not even necessary or a requirement. With that said, nature/natural systems not designed by human hands is not partial towards anyone nor does it discriminate against anyone, it gives or has the ability to give to everyone without the need of human intervention. Now,  it's a fact that the activities of humans, whether good or bad affects the earth, all living organisms and their quality of life. Moreover, nature/natural systems not designed by humans presents the truth as is, it doesn't hide, cover up or conceal the truth from anyone, it is what it is! That's the beauty of nature/natural systems created by the Supreme God, it's infinite and has the ability to defeat mere human philosophy and eventually will put an end to the acts of evil humans and their technology. Furthermore, all humans have free will or freedom of choice, it will be their own decisions of how the use their free will that will decide their fate and they will face the consequences of their actions. \n\nI brought up incest/inbreeding because it was relevant to the origin of the concept of \"<b> race\"</b>.

I agree to a certain extent alot of arabs look white infact quite alot do but most don't tho even tho they're quite close to it . it doesn't make them white it just makes them close to white .  Rugby and american foot ball is quite similar but still it's considered ah different sport . from what I've seen most of the arabs that look white are usually the ones from Lebanon and I'm not saying just Lebanon but alot of those lebs look like mederteranean whites like italians . arab is not a <b> race </b>. in my opinion there are different arab races who looks slightly different from country to country . afghans usually have folded eye lids almost like orientals and gulf arabs look very very arabian alot of them even look<b>  indian</b> or south asian .  Jordanians are usually very dark skinded kind of like ah dark brown complection. and it's like that in ever<b> y rac</b>e , there are white races<b>  , bla</b>ck races , Polynesian races and so on .why are you dying to be white , yes greeks are white but you're only 1/2 .",

They set up Corner stores in every Latino and <b> black </b>community but they hardly ever hire any one that's not Arab especially Latinos and blacks. They also don't purchase from any non Arab businesses so good luck going to an Arab community and opening up a store they won't buy from you because your not Arab but if a Arab sets up a store in a non Arab community and people don't buy from them because they aren't the same<b>  ethnicity</b> o<b> r rac</b>e as them they would probably c<b> ry raci</b>sm like the Arab women in this video. Very religious Muslims also  don't like having contact with any non Muslims and are very sensitive when it comes to jokes which is very annoying when you try to communicate with them.",

If you study are culture, you'll find that we have more similarities with the Greeks and Italians than the Arabs. The Arabs are more like Indians but, maybe richer because of all the oil. We on the other hand Palestinians Lebanese Jordanians and Syrians are much different. Please don't say that we caused the Arab spring and we like to kill each other.

I am a Christian Middle Eastern and do not mind if we get our own <b> race </b>on the consensus, as long as the box says middle eastern, not ARAB. Being able to check white didn't make me feel privileged at all. In fact, I experienced a bit of<b>  racism</b> in America from people who are close-minded. Although, I look white I do have an accent when speaking English. Arabic on my resume is not helping at all and many employers reject my resume because of this. They would think I am a Muslim just because my first language is Arabic. I am against any kind of discrimination.\n\n Our heritage does not go back to the arab tribes of arabia who happen to be a bit darker skinned. We consider ourselves to be Christians who descend from the people of Jesus Christ who used to make up the majority of the levantine region, until the muslim arabs took over and stole our land and abolished our language and culture. We are Cananites, phoenicians, semites...not arabs and had our own aramaic language. Aksum, are you eritrean?",

I also want to add if you want to go by the Biblical definition of heritages and decedents then ALL Middle Easterners are decedents of Ham just like Africans and East Asians. Genesis chapter 10 will show in details where all human decedents came from. Europeans are decedents of Japheth, and Jews are decedent of Shem (that's why they're called Semites). Prior to the 1800s, the Middle East used to be called, Greater Africa. There is a reason why the Middle East has more in <b> common </b>with Africa than it does with Europe, from the climate, to the language, cultures, plants, animals, etc. \n\nBut, i understand why you want to be classified as \"white.\" Since there is an immense amount of privilege that comes with being classified as white. However, you're getting your wake up call, more and more white people don't consider you one of their people. You guys are learning the hard way. Not my problem though since we Sub-Saharan Africans are proud to be Africans. We don't have low self-esteem issues like you Middle Easterners. #ProudEthiopia #ProudAfrican #ProudSubSaharanAfrican",

I am Lebanese too and when you apply to jobs in the United States, your name stands out first. They can tell from your name if you are Arab or white and you will be discriminated based on that. There is no privilege. I wish I was identified as middle eastern, I would have applied to scholarships at universities that only the blacks or asians have access to. The reason why we were identified as white is because prior to 1950s only white people were able to immigrate to America, so the Arabs protested and wanted to change that and be able to immigrate.

Your claim about minority benefits is nonsensical. Scholarship to Muslims (if that's even a thing) doesn't come from the government it comes from private donors. And Islam is a religion, not <b> a rac</b>e. Your comment there is irrelevant. Christian Arabs may not receive such benefit but then again they don't have to worry about discrimination to the extent Muslims face in the US. \n\n> Stop trying to associate yourself with them.\n\nOh, look who's trying to divide and conquer.  Arab Muslims have lived with Arab Christians in peace for centuries. Some Christian Arab tribes were allies of Muslims against Romans (Byzantines) who were Christian as well.\n\nYou're only classifying yourself <b> as bla</b>ck because it's more advantageous to you in North America. Go to Ethiopia and ask the Habesha if they <b> are bl</b>ack. You'll get a clear answer that they don't consider themselves to be that. Diaspora Ethiopians are not necessarily going to have the same mentality as Ethiopians residing at home.\n\nAlso, it's funny you try to make yourself look reasonable and then delete other people's comments. Free speech is foreign to you.\n\nDelusional Christian Afrocentrists are some of the dumbest people in the world.",

Morocco is 70-80% nort<b> h Africa</b>n DNA, with a bit of middle eastern, Iberian and  sub-sahran. The DOMINANT DNA is nor<b> th Afric</b>an Amazigh and their DNA is the oldest native genetic marker in North africa. \n\nNo continent has one color<b>  or ethnic</b>ity. Northern Africans are separated from Sub saharan Africans by the SAHARA desreret, the harshest wide desert in the world,  separate people with different climates. FYI color melanin is product of climate. North Africa is Mediterranean climate, so we don't need high melanin. People away from equater are lighter due to climaye change and adaptation. Moreover, how could you deny DNA evidence of origin ?? Or are you another balck ashamed of you sub sa<b> hran afr</b>ican origon? Maybe because sub sahran didn't produce any notable civilizations? Do DNA test and see for yourself , it doesn't cost much, be honest. All countries around the medeterian sea have the same color, this include south France, south itlay, south Spain, Cyprus and Greece on the Europena side, , then you have North Africans , Turkey and Levant on the southern side. Just open your map really, they are closer to us than we are close to sub sahran geographically.  We are much closer to each other due to geography,  climate and shared history. DNA doesn't lie. We can trace the location of each DNA and the first inhabitants. Northern Africans have native Amazigh DNA.",
