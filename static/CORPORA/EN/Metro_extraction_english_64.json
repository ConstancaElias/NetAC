She wants younger men.', '\u2018Younger men, they get off on getting a woman off \u2013 very different from when I was younger,\u2019 Hattie explains.', 'The New York-based mum-of-two and grandma is in tune with her body and sexuality.', 'A former dancer, Hattie was married for over 25 years and says she and her ex-husband had a \u2018wonderful sex life.\u2019', 'Missing the intimacy and embracing the casualness of modern dating, Hattie exclusively goes out with men many years her junior.', '\u2018I screw, I sleep with, I make love with many men and not one of them has said, \u201cI want you for my life\u201d,\u2019 she says.', 'We stan a sex-positive grandma.', 'Hattie says that she is often referred to as a \u2018cougar\u2019 but is trying to reverse the negative preconceptions attached to the lifestyle.', '\u2018Cougars, as I see them, are not beasts of prey, they are an exquisite animal,\u2019 she says.', '\u2018I\u2019m never on the prowl. I never approach a man, men always approach me.\u2019', 'Hattie has a steady selection of casual lovers she connects with through dating apps such as Tinder.', 'Since she began using the app eight months ago, she claims to have met close to 50 men.', 'Her Tinder bio reads: \u2018Hattie, 83, fascinating older beauty. Seeking a steady younger friend/lover for a shared life of adventure and passion. No pro-Trump and no players.\u2019', 'The youngest man she has been with was aged 19, although she insists she believed he was older.', 'Hattie is currently dating Shaun, 33, making him 50 years her junior.', 'After the split with her ex-husband, Hattie put an advert in the newspaper seeking younger men to sleep with.', 'She claims she was inundated with messages and had to \u2018audition\u2019 the potential partners.', 'When she began dating, she had hoped to find a meaningful connection with another man.', 'But now she is just enjoying the carousel of different suitors.', '\u2018I\u2019m not agonising,\u2019 she adds. \u2018I\u2019m grateful that at this age and this stage that I have as many lovers as I want.', '\u2018My life goal is to change the awful, decrepit view of ageing \u2013 view and experience, and turn it into something exciting. A life-loving adventure.', '\u2018The depth of life, you can\u2019t avoid it. But the shallowness of good sex, that\u2019s what is good enough for me.\u2019', 'Do you have an older woman or much younger an in your life?
