        "subtitle": " BORIS JOHNSON tore into Jeremy Corbyn over his \u201cabsurd dither and delay\u201d Brexit policy last night in a furious live television clash that ignited the General Election campaign. In their first head-to-head debate in the contest for the December 12 poll, the Prime Minister asked the Labour leader nine times to spell out whether he would support remaining in the EU or leaving the bloc if a second referendum is triggered \u2013 but failed to get an answer.

        "postText": "'The Prime Minister said: We don't know on which side Mr Corbyn will campaign. Will he campaign for Leave or Remain? Mr Corbyn is trying to conceal the void at the heart of their Brexit policy. The Labour chief repeatedly said he would give voters the final say without specifying his own position. Their row over Brexit dominated barbed exchanges in front of a studio audience in Salford on the ITV Johnson v Corbyn programme.', 'A snap YouGov poll judged Mr Johnson the winner of the debate by a wafer-thin margin of 51 percent to 49 percent.', 'During the ill-tempered exchanges, the pair also clashed over the NHS, the economy and climate change.', 'Both leaders were jeered by members of the audience when they attempted to sideline questioning about public despair at the childish abuse rife in Westminster politics.', 'At one stage Julie Etchingham urged the pair to take responsibility for the tone of debate and insisted they both shake hands to agree to work to improve behaviour between politicians.', 'From his opening statement, Mr Johnson pressed the opposition leader to clear up the issue of his stance on Brexit.', 'There\u2019s only one reason why we\u2019re having this election, and that is that we have a deadlocked parliament that will not deliver Brexit, and whether you voted for Leave or Remain, people want to get Brexit done, and to unleash the potential of this entire country, the Prime Minister said.', 'He added: If you vote for us, we have a deal that is ready to go. As soon as we can get that deal through Parliament, as we can in the next few weeks, we can get on with the people\u2019s priorities.', 'As Mr Corbyn repeatedly failed to say which side he would campaign on in a second referendum, the Prime Minister said: If he is elected prime minister he will dither and delay for months and months and then force the country though the chaos of another two referendums. He will not set out his plan, and will not be clear whether he\u2019s for leave or remain. He is refusing to rule out campaigning against his own deal.', 'Demanding clarity, Mr Johnson said it was absurd that Labour could end up negotiating a new deal with Brussels in Government only to then campaign against it.', 'Shrugging off the demands for an answer, Mr Corbyn said: We will give you the people the final say and implement whatever you decide.', 'Mr Johnson also took the Labour leader to task over the possibility of him being propped up in Downing Street by the Scottish National Party.', 'The price of Nicola Sturgeon\u2019 s support will be a referendum on the union with Scotland, the Prime Minister said.', 'Mr Corbyn became rattled when Miss Etchingham raised the issue of allegation of anti - Semitism within the Labour Party.', 'He said: Racism in any form is a scourge in our society. I have taken action in my party where anyone who has committed any anti - Semitic acts or made any anti - Semitic statements, they either suspended or expelled from the party and investigated every single case. We do take this very, very seriously indeed.', 'Later, as the pair clashed over the economy, the Prime Minister said: Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party have said they want to overthrow capitalism. I do say I think that would be disastrous for this country.', 'Quizzed by a hospital doctor on how the NHS will be able to meet growing demands, Mr Johnson warned Labour\u2019 s plans to cut the working week to 32 hours would heap pressure on hospitals.', ' He added: What could be more ruinous for the NHS than a crackpot plan for a four day week which would add massively to the burden not just of the NHS but of every public service in the country ?', 'Mr Corbyn also appeared to raise questions about the future of the Monarchy when the issue of the scandal surrounding Prince Andrew was raised.', ' When asked if the monarchy was fit for purpose, the Labour leader said : It needs a bit of improvement. Mr Johnson insisted: The institution of the Monarchy is beyond approach.', 'Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said: Jeremy Corbyn showed exactly why he is unfit to govern our country.He failed nine or 10 times to say where he stands on Brexit.', ' The YouGov poll also found 54 percent of voters quizzed thought Mr Johnson was the most prime ministerial of the pair compared with 29 percent for Mr Corbyn.', 'Following the debate, Tory MP Nigel Evans told the Daily Express: I thought it was absolutely stunning that time and time again Corbyn avoided the simple but fundamental question about how he would campaign in his proposed second Brexit referendum.', ' I mean shifty doesn\u2019 t even come close.He refused nine or 10 times to answer the question and the public won\u2019 t tolerate that.', ' Responding to Mr Corbyn\u2019 s comments on the monarchy, Home Secretary Priti Patel also told the Daily Express: We, like everyone, respect the monarchy as an institution and I think Corbyn has been exposed, yet again, for his vacuous views and his lack of commitment to many, many great British institutions.I think it 's disgraceful, that's my personal view.', 'Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Boris Johnson won the debate hands down with his positivity, optimism and self belief.', 'Mr Raab said: On the second referendum it was totally unclear what the price Jeremy Corbyn is willing to pay to be propped up in No.10. It was telling, both on Brexit and the Scottish referendum, that Corbyn was not willing to come clean with voters.', 'Meanwhile, Brexit Party Chairman Richard Tice said that he thought the ITV clash was spicy and exposed Jeremy Corbyn's nonsense on Brexit.', 'He said: The key point was that the Prime Minister made clear that the transition period will end in December 2020, no ifs, no buts.','There was all sorts of nonsense talked by Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit. The reason why he refused to answer the question on how he would campaign in a second referendum is that he wants to rig the ballot paper with two options \u2013 Remain and fudged Remain.'",

As for the Johnson and Corbyn debate, well for a start they could have done better if only they had watched a more diplomatic politician who knew what he was talking about and who gave straight forward answers to every question put to him, Farage left them both with egg on their face. Today both political partys will be declaing sucess, their media supporters will be singing their praises and as a result we will be subjected to even more garabge in the their attempts to bully, scare, and entice voters. Corbyn will continue to dangle his fishing line using the same bait as in the 2017 general Election knowing he will again renege on his promises, whilst Johnson will intensify his promise to ge<b> t Brexi</b>t done whilst the real debater and far supierior politician, Namely Nigel Farage will be sidetracked and ignored by both the newspapers and the television companies.We can only hope that in this the most importand general Election for forty odd years that the electorate do not throw away the chance to rid our parliment of the fifth rate politicians who have tried their best to destroy democracy.",

Johnson is lost when he runs out of pre - scripted slogans that he 's had to learn by rote, and Corbyn is so utterly deceitful he's afraid to admit that his second referendum will contain two choices: A Labour - negotiated WA that is effectively a BRINORemain. Both are an embarrassment to British politics and one wonders if there is anyone today with the same passion, intellect and patriotism as the late, great Lady Thatcher ? She must be rolling in her grave. ",

We 'd now be calling the shots around Europe instead of the Germans. But oh no, the market knows best said Thatcher, let the investors decide if we should become the next silicon valley. They decided we shouldn't, and instead the UK should rely on the funny money banks. Little do people know the UK was once the world leader in fibre optic networks as far back as 1974. \"Unfortunately, the Thatcher government decided that it wanted the American cable companies providing the same service to increase competition. So the decision was made to close down the local loop roll out and in 1991 that roll out was stopped. The two factories that BT had built to build fibre related components were sold to Fujitsu and HP, the assets were stripped and the expertise was shipped out to South East Asia.\" Our colleagues in Korea and Japan, who were working with quite closely at the time, stood back and looked at what happened to us in amazement.What was pivotal was that they carried on with their respective fibre rollouts, they now enjoy over 1000 Mps The rest is history as they say. The UK lost out on hundreds of billions and instead now has foodbanks and is at war with itself. Just one example of letting the Tories and their market chums decide our futures. ",

After his landmark speech to the United Nations in Geneva, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was awarded a highly prestigious international peace prize, partly for his work helping to bring peace in Northern Ireland. The award ceremony was held in the presence of the Mayor of Geneva and invited guests, including a UNI Global Union delegation led by General Secretary Philip Jennings, alongside the General Secretary of the ITUC, Sharan Burrow. After the ceremony on Friday, UNI GS, Philip Jennings said, It\u2019 s fitting that Jeremy Corbyn has been given this award, just two days before ICAN, the International Campaign for the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons receives the Nobel Peace Prize. On behalf of all our UK affiliates and all of our 20 million affiliates around the world we congratulate him. Peace and unions go hand - in -hand\u2013 they are as Reiner Braun, the head of the IPB, put it two - sides of the same coin. Jeremy Corbyn is a former union official and someone who has dedicated his political life to peace, and we salute him. ",
