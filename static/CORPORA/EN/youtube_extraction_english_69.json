            "commentText": "The legal system in most countries truly needs an overhaul due to the way victims of <b> sexual </b>assault and/or rape are typically treated.\n\nIn many western countries a single judge, typically a male, is the person who decides whether the case \"has merit\" enough to go to trial which involves a jury. And unfortunately those few cases where a<b>  woman</b> does report the rape to police and takes it to court usually end with that one judge deciding it won't go any further i.e. the case is dropped. \n\nFurthermore, those women who do go to both the police and the courts commonly experience a lot of blaming by police officers and it gets much worse when it comes to the lawyer defending the assailant(s). \n      It still happens that th<b> e sexua</b>l history of the victim is legally allowed to be brought up, as is her mode of dressing, behaviour and so on, all to try to make it look like it wasn't assault or rape. \n\nAnd if t<b> he wom</b>an froze, a most typical response<b>  to sex</b>ual assault and understood as quite a normal reaction -  at least by psychologists and rape crisis counsellors - the fact she froze and didn't physically 'fight back' is taken to indicate she consented! \n\nUnless a survivor of assault or rape has very obvious marks on her <b> that doc</b>tors - typically those who saw her after the traumatic event such as when making up the 'rape kit' in Hospital EDs - will unequivocally state is proof of force used against her, from bruising to tears etcetera, it's extr<b> emely c</b>ommon for the case to be reduced to one of 'he said, she said' with the survivor being further victimized by a court system w<b> here a</b> woman who has been assaulted or raped has every aspect of her life out under the microscope by the defendant's lawyer to try to prove it was consensual and indeed to blame the survivor. Furthermore even cases where evidence of physical force is obvious, the assailant's lawyer will still try to make it appear to be a case of con<b> sens</b>ual sex that was a bit 'rough'. \n\nOne famous case in point is in the book \"Lucky\", the debut novel of the writer, Alice Sebold, of the much more well know \"The Lovely Bones\" (which was made into a movie), in which she relates her own horrific rape and the trauma of getting it to court - and winning. At the time, Alice Sebold was a virgin who was attacked and raped by a man she did not know on her College campus, and it was very obvious that it was an incredibly aggressive rape: her assailant had also threatened her with a knife, nearly strangled her, hit her etc. - but the lawyer for the rapist went on the attack in court regarding everything from the clothes she was wearing at the time to asking why she didn't strike him or scream out! The book, \"Lucky\", is a must-read f<b> or eve</b>ry woman (and those w<b> ho kno</b>w a woman who has be<b> en thro</b>ugh sexual abuse, assault and/or rape), particularly as it reveals the mendacious techniques used by lawyers for rapists and abusers, and the way victims of such trauma are re-traumatised by the legal process.\n\nCombine the horrendously traumatic effects of be<b> ing thr</b>ough sexual assault or rape - such as seen in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a frequent result of such events - with the current legal system that tends to revictimize the survivor(s), and it's no wonder so few women report assaults.",

She didn't quit Hollywood it quit her. She's found relevance in this # metoo era of professional victimhood and manufactured outrage.  I don't think she's ever proven one single ridiculous story she's told. She got crap for bad plastic surgery and made up a car accident. I dont doubt that she slept with producers and regrets it now that the money is gone. She's a pathological liar and narcissist.  She had no problem with<b>  sexism</b> in Hollywood back when she was getting roles. This generation certainly needs some strong female role models but people like Rose McGowan and Stormy Daniels aren't them. Plenty of women in Hollywood have refused to do the hotel auditions and lost roles but built careers off talent and hard work. They get absolutely no credit for that. People who build a career on a mattress have a short career.  It only last as long as their looks do.",

I am a feminist, however, I don't agree with all of Rose's actions or how she's portraying herself now. I do however believe as human beings that we should be respected equally. I hope Rose continues to work on healing herself through directing & producing some badass work because at the end of the day, no matter what any of us have been through, we've got to push forward in as positive of a way as possible.",

Anthony confronted her, they had a fight and Asia post a bullying picture on Instagram towards Anthony, hours later Anthony was dead.  When Asia found out he was dead she removed her bullying post and proceeds to post how he was her rock and how much she loved him.  The media won't call her out because she is huge in the #metoo movement and a huge feminist, she was photographed happy with Harvey Weinstein 4 years after the alleged rape occured.  Her friend Rose Mcgowen  was asked to help Asia not get shamed by the public, even though the media has left her alone.  Rose wrote a letter recently and gave it to media outlets to state that Anthony and Asia had an open relationship, (this was not known to be true to anyone, no photos in 2 years with other partners, Asia also asked the paparazzi Rino Barillari to delete a pic of her and Hugo dancing ) they are trying to do public relation damage control about Asia being a slut and helping to kill Anthony with her bullying, with not one word of sympathy to the daughter of Anthony or the family.  Anthony deleted Asia from social media before he died....Pass this on he deserves it.\n\n  [LINK] \n\n [LINK] \n\nAsia Argento once made a movie where they dressed a 10 year <b> old </b>in drag and performed oral<b>  sex</b> on Marilyn Mansion.  Her dad made horror films simulating snuff films and had her star in them as a child, he also featured pedophilia.  Asia Argenta's Instagram has many pictures of her worshiping the occult.  It is said that she thinks she is <b> a r<b> e</b</b<b> >>d wi</b>tch (whatever the fuck that is) Her young daughter has the same images on her profile as well.  Her best friend Rose Mcgowen that helps her try to champion the Metoo movement has a felony cocaine charge pending.  Rose Mcgowen attacked Anthony Bourdain after his death stating Asia was strong enough to live for her daughter, Anthony wasn't.",

After the years of insanity she's experienced in her life it wouldn't surprise me if she's hearing voices in her head and talking to herself. She was really cool when she was younger and incredibly insightful but now she seems like a pseudo-lesbo whack job with a buzz cut. Man bring back jawbreaker Rose or Scream Rose she was hot then but now she has this Girl Interrupted vibe...Angelina Jolie's character in the movie. Hope Rose gets through this and is ok its not cool what that industry and her parents have done to her.",

They don't speak out when any real risk is involved, yet expect normal people in society to bear that load. We all know that <b> sexual </b>assault is wrong, and guys that commit<b>  sexual</b> assault are societal outliers. It's not the norm as they try to assert it is. I'm tired of being lectured to and told something is wrong with me by people who let the shit slide until they made enough money and now they want to pat themselves on the back and show me how I should act. Guess what, I've been acting right the whole time. I've never let assault slide and I've always known it's wrong.",

But if I bared my buttcheeks to her in public, I'd be put in jail. Always knew she was a fucked up little cunt when she was hanging around with Marilyn Manson. I want the details on her H.W. rape. Did he just try to hug her? Did he try to kiss her? Did he finger her <b> pussy?</b> Did he slip his pud in her mouth. Did he lick her mary-jane? Did he fuck her? Did he slip it up her poop-chute? What are the details? What all did he get from her for her being his $100,000 whore? Just what is her definition of rape??",

Directly causing other women to suffer because you were too weak to stand up for you own dignity.  Hollywood is full of rat bastards and whores.",

On one hand, she says acting is easy but then later says directing is easy, acting made her anxious. This interviewer just felt like she was sucking up to her and agreed to everything she had to say and did not want to pick up on any contradictions. So is every <b> woman </b>who feels threatened or sexualised as an actress just jump to being a director because you get to captain the ship? A lot of women may not have that privelege. Asking her 'do u do drugs' was just plain inappropriate.",

If someone reads that and decides to wear it, that is their choice and they should not be judged for it anymore than you want to be judged for \"wearing<b>  nothing</b>\". If someone reads that and goes \"yeah, that's not for me\", then they have a choice to walk way. Just like she had a choice to not allow herself to be sexualized by wearing that dress. If she chose to allow it, it was her choice and she was a part of the system of sexualization. I just don't get now how she can say \"it's my choice\" yet blame others for the \"system\". Either you're fed up with the system and make choices that counter the sexualization or you CHOOSE to play into it as your perogative to do so. Where is the personal responsibility?",

Weinstein having fingered her holes circled back around for her to have an issue to advertise her directoral debut.  Good play Rose, good play.",

Rape, and harassment ARE CRIMES. That is why you report it to the police.\n\nWeinstein is most likely guilty of everything he is accused of. And if that is the truth then he should be in prison for his crimes. BUT THAT IS A MATTER FOR THE POLICE AND OUR COURTS. If you remove a system of justice that protects all people because it seems a group is not receiving far justice, then what will protect you as a journalist down the road? \n\nI used to be a fan. Now I am disappointed in how the media uses its influence to destroy lives and businesses before allegations are tried in our courts. We are at an important turning point where crimes of a nature like this will no longer be tried in the courts but in the court of public opinion.",

Distinctions need to be made in each case if Harvey raped, sexually assaulted or was merely involved in consensual agreement of transactional <b> sex </b>with women who may now be crying assault or rape.  It is likely he is guilty of all three types of charges, but from my experience, women have a bad habit of selectively editing reality after the fact to suit their story.  Those who prostituted themselves with transactional<b>  sex</b> need to be honest about it and not conflate it with assault or rape as that diminishes the plight of the victims who suffered those other violations.",

It's okay to express bein<b> g sexua</b>l. The point is to not sexually fucking assault people. No ones asking for it by looking sexy. It's okay to make advances towards<b>  a wom</b>an you are interested in, it's not okay to continue you when it is UNWANTED. And how dare you invalidate what happened to those victims. Those women were young and vulnerable. A man in power used that to his ability so he could assault them and he was so much in power they stayed silent. Shame on you. Lick nutzzzzzzz dick head.",

This person was going to be prosecuted if the victims were willing to be dragged through the mud for months during a public trial. Months of having to endure \"slut shamers\" like you who was not there but yet somehow knows exactly what happened. The humiliation and shame they already felt was compounded by a room full of lawyers (including their own lawyers and local police) telling them they don't have enough evidence to win a conviction so wouldn't she just rather get it over with by settling? A confident person with enough evidence and a smart lawyer would never back down for some cash. But a scared girl with no support, usually girls with a history of instability or abuse, brainwashed to have a fear of being banished to slut-ville has-beens who failed to sleep their way to the top town, well that humiliated and defeated victem will take what everyone tells her she deserves! Because girls are taught this if they are famous or not. Predators know how to find the insecure and fragile people who are easily intimated... Hello that's what defines PREDATOR. Your personal experience with gold diggers & <b> promiscuous </b>women has no relevance in a rape allegation. There is no correlation here. You have no idea what you are talking about until and unless you have experienced this first hand. Predators choose times and places where there can be no witness beside the victem and they learn how to leave little evidence behind. Don't act like you have never heard of rich people getting away with something criminal. There are thousands of cases where criminals and predators have paid away the consequence of a crime. In the case of Harvey, Cosby, and any other cerial rapists, how many victims need to come forward before we start talking about the institutions that enable these Predators versus focusing on how a damaged and scared victem acted poorly. People who feel alone scared and helpless do not make good decisions. What is his excuse?",

There are a lot of women (Rashida Jones, Tina Fey, Lena Dunham, Mayim Bilaik\u2026) who admire and say more or less the same things without this bad-ass pose. I disagree also on one thing: women of course must wear what they want and have the right to feel comfortable with their own body, however showing your boobs and ass on a magazine or during an event doesn't give an independent, powerful strong message to women. On the contrary, in my opinion, it gives the idea that that is the only thing women can do. You are sexualising yourself and you are using the same narrative provided by generations of sexist men. To the young girls and women who read this: how to break the narrative? Become writer, director, producer. Create your own narrative and live it. Be aware of the dangers. Learn how to respond. Learn how to refuse a <b> sexual </b>harassment and think about it. Be ready. If and when it happens you probably will be less scared and more confident.",

Men are wired to seduce women... if a women does not want to be seduced, who cares, we move on to the next women. But if a women who does not want to be seduced challenges a man on ANY level in the same way a man would, then we react giving her the same NATURAL feed back we give other MEN who challenge our nature. Women want men to let them treat us any way they want but don't want to deal with what comes with it saying \"Why would you say such a thing to me you PIG I'm still a <b> woman </b>so you're<b>  nothing</b> but a fucking MONSTER let me do/say whatever I want and don't judge me!!\".... Listen, if you are a girl... and you argue with EVERY official until they let you put on football pads and get on the field... you're getting hit because YOU ARE ON THE FIELD not because you're a women... stop challenging our nature WE ARE NOT OTHER WOMEN we are naturally dominant so we do not back down from your bullshit like other more feminine/docile women do. And NO I don't support beating women read between the fucking lines. STOP BITCHING and just DO whatever the fuck you want. Acting TOUGH and then getting mad at our words is something FEMALES do which is precisely why both men AND women who do that are called little bitches.

And you know, I think she is doing a lot of good for a lot of people despite what her critics say. We needed someone to blow the whistle on Hollywood like she did. And the media moguls are still trying to silence her, to make her seem like just another <b> crazy </b>feminist, so no one will believe her - it's gaslighting on a worldwide scale so they can get away with it.

No, girl. That the easy exit. You want to validate your point, you don't answer insulting. You are a poser.",

Funny how you take the 'logical' 'detached' approach to Rose's comments, like you have some authority on the subject.  She, Rose can feel and express how she wants.  The minute a<b>  woman</b> is being her strength the attackers come out in force NOT for the subject for which she speaks, but the tone of her commentary, the words used and the obvious \"Fuck You\" tone it carry's.  It is scary when <b> a woma</b>n steps into her power, hence the reason men and society wants to keep her squashed down, devalued, demoralised, distressed, depressed, denied.  Also, she isn't being bitter.  Again, Rose, a<b> ny wom</b>an (and man) can speak anyhow they want, if you don't like it move off the video - don't comment.",

She just wants to do whatever she wants to do, period, and she's using the \"I am an object of <b> sexual </b>desire\" as sort of her trigger to do other things. It fuels her anger, and seems to be her motivation to say \"fuck you\" in whatever way she sees fit to say it.\n\nOn a side note, society controls everyone's sexuality to one degree or  another. It's seen as liberating for people to be free to just do whatever they want, especially with regards to<b>  sex</b>, but again, once you get it into your head and accept that you CAN do whatever you want, the next question should be \"should I?\" The journey doesn't stop with \"Yes you can.\"\n\nTL;DR she's being far too simplistic about her own life, and her perspective was being touted as new or enlightened. It's not bad, per se, but it has its problems.",

The thing is in a more biological standpoint, men are usually stronger and therefore better for the army, although nowadays there is a a lot of women in the army. You should also consider that when men were drafted women filled in their jobs, so they were still contributing. The problem is women nowadays, as Rose says (maybe not in the most calm way) deserve equal opportunities in the workplace and not to be a treated as mere objects partly because I think we have proved more than enough that we are much more than that. Also, the feminist movement benefits men by defeating <b> gender </b>roles.",

            "commentText": "Lol.  You know what I find very telling after watching and skimming through the comments?  The majority of male commentors here (and some female) who are proving Rose's point about sexist Hollywood indoctrination.  People don't even have to agree with all her points or perspectives but there should be a way to counter it without resorting to misogynistic remarks.  Most of these insults flying at Rose don't have an intellectual foundation in their bodies.  What I keep reading in response are these defensive attacks saturated with <b> sexism.</b>  The attacks are completely sexualized:   She is referred to as a Cunt (a derogatory term for a<b>  woman</b>'s genital area); being told she is just bitter because she is now to<b> o ol</b>d to be objectified sexually; ridiculous justifications that it is nature for Hollywood to sexualize women because of procreation (wtf?); and my personal favorites - all the spiteful MRA an<b> ti-wom</b>an lingo being thrown loosely around wheneve<b> r a wo</b>man points out an injustice against other women.  We'll hear  'but what about all the men' to detract and counter the female issues.   Or we get 'sh<b> e is not</b>hing but a femnazi' while all feminism gets brandished as evil and wrong.  \n\nAll these responses are reinforcing how right Rose really is about the 'system' itself and how the male mind has been indoctrinated to insult or engage in bring<b> ing a </b>woman down they don't agree with.   This mindset is also plaguing women too.   Many males here are doing it t<b> hrough </b>sexual name shaming rather than creating some type of respectable argument to debate her points.  The insults go straight to her looks or her feminine sexuality.  She is<b>  cal</b>led fat or ugly; labeled as a Cunt or a Bitch (a comparison to a female dog).  Why?  \n\nI mean, at least most of the time when men are being insulted they get more neutral insults flung against them.  Why<b>  can't</b> a woman just be a plain out a**hole or a jerk like some guy if all the maturity needs to sink <b> below</b> sub zero?  Why does every derogatory insult need to attac<b> k eith</b>e<b> r a wom</b>an's gender or sexuality when there is disagreement?   The very comments proclaiming to be against her are helping to showcase what it is she is actually against.  \n\nThis is ridiculous.  She gets slammed for actually using the very system in place, that many women have, a system that would have held her back for not complying with it.  And because she might have had some self-realization for what it was that she was participating in she gets crucified for wearing something tight or very revealing at a time in her life to discredit her?  Those types of remarks are showing the misogynistic indoctrination of the West because switch over to some indigenous populations where the females still remain completely explosed on top and use scarce undergarments in their cultures away from civilized indoctrinations.  They are not being sexually exploited or shamed for this by the men in their tribes so this BS argument that it's natural for men to treat or exploit w<b> omen in</b> this sexual way due to procreation is hogwash.",

As if every major hollywood actor isn't some massive heartthrob who has to train 7 days a week for months drinking only chicken milkshakes so you can finger fuck yourselves to them. \n\nMen are used as <b> sex </b>objects just as much as women are, the only difference is in the preferences of male sexuality vs female sexuality. Leading men are usually<b>  sex</b> symbols for longer simply because women young and older by large margin find handsome older men sexy, and young girls and yes older women, find young twenty something studs sexy as well. \n\nMen on the other hand, typically only find younger women sexy, that's genetic, it's how nature wants us to be to find healthy young women to reproduce with and create stronger children, it ha<b> s nothin</b>g to do wi<b> th sexi</b>sm. \n\nIs Ryan Gosl<b> ing </b>fat in any movies? Do you think if he suddenly gained 30 pounds and refused to lose it he would get ANY roles, or women would give a fuck about him anymore?\n\nRose McGowan is a fucking terrible actress, she should thank her lucky stars, much like Zac Efron that they were considered so good looking that they got roles even with their minimal talent range. \n\nNot to mention that almost every major movie today and video game is dominated by a strong female lead and that's fine but the idea that women are being oppressed.....what kind of brain do you have?\n\nThis fake men vs women war really needs to stop. Most of us men have supported strong women forever, we don't give a shit if the hero is male or female as long as they are awesome. We all played the shit out of tomb raider 20 years ago and feminists complain that it's only acceptable because she's hot......when the fuck has a male video game hero not been a ripped, ass kicking super dude that none of us could hope to be?\n\nThis bias blindness women have is really troubling. It's like the great meme of Barbie and He-Man. Women bitched for decades about Barbie creating unfair expectations of women, but no one says anything about all the little boy heroes that were 6 foot 3 with 18 pack abs.",

She's not the first to speak out about <b> sexism </b>and even make celebrities such as Bradley Cooper have spoken out about it. And sadly it's NOT just in Hollywood, it's everywhere. And btw so what if she showed skin, feminism is about EQUALITY, not how much of your body you're \"allowed\" to show. When women start to think, speak, and act out like men, people immediately get triggered.",

To more reasoned people like myself, modern western feminism has multiple facets and focuses and even ideologies (e.g. some feminists insist transwomen are not women), but one sort of consistent theme is a focus on the way society interacts with and constrains women in non-legal manners (with the exception of issues like birth control), as opposed to the more concretely legal agenda of the earlier waves of feminism. So it's a pretty third wave feminist thing to point out the <b> misogyny </b>of rappers, or the type of<b>  sexism</b> Rose McGowan is claiming exists in Hollywood. Now, you don't have to agree with her, but the fruitful way of expressing that disagreement is to provide cogent arguments ... not lazily claiming she has no points or logic and that all of third wave feminism is about female superiority.",

I'm a feminist and I respect men and don't want there to be animosity between the sexes. \n\nFeminism is simply a call for equality.

This is not the case in many parts of the world, and a <b> woman </b>running for president doesn't change that. Women should be as safe from<b>  sexual</b> violence as men are.

Just a couple of examples of the things that feminists want to change...\n\nIf you hope that your mother, sister, and girlfriend are safe to walk down the street at night, and that they get a decent wage, you are already a feminist, I think.

Then when they have compromised themselves they look back and think \"Did III REALLY do that?...\"\nFalse personas at work. Psychological issues. \nSad really I think.",

She has every right to be angry and if you truly believe that shes a hypocrite because she was highly sexualized and utilized her sexuality throughout her career? Like choosing to call her a slut and say she's just to<b> o ol</b>d to be fuckable and that's why she's pissed then congrats you are literally the problem. That targeted language and equating of\u00a0a womans worth to how attractive they are/shaming them for reveling in their sexuality as opposed to just being<b>  a sexu</b>al object/ornament to a man. Like <b> the sex</b>ism in so many of these comments is so overt and clearly misogynistic that its legitimately shocking to me that those commenters don't even know that what they're thinking and saying stems from all<b>  the miso</b>gyny they've internalized. So sad, I hope that one day people will learn to be more empathetic and recognize their privilege in relation to the oppressed, as well as how the oppressed feel and act.",

                    "commentText": "Roman Darius If you want to talk about tampons, the concept is very simple: if I have a headache, I take medicine. Medication is considered a necessity, so they are not taxed. Trust me, you want me to take medicine for my headache so I won't annoy you with my white girl whining, am I right? So...I'm bleeding from my uterus, I need a tampon. Tampons and feminine hygiene products are NOT considered a necessity, so they are taxed in some states. You want me to use a tampon to keep me from bleeding all over your house, right? I mean, I could free bleed (theoretically, because personally I don't get my period anymore. Cancer sucks.)...now, because of my white girl privilege, paying a tax for my tampons was never a problem for me. It's the principle. Women bleed, we have no choice. We need sanitary products for health, safety, and apparently to make you men feel more comfortable. There are women in shelters, in poverty, and on the streets who free bleed because they have no choice. It's not safe. It's not healthy. Why should lip balm be tax exempt and not tampons? I guarantee if men bled, there would be no tax. Just think about it. Calm yourself and think. In the words of Ashley Judd, since you mentioned her, \"I'm nasty like the bloodstains on my bedsheets. We do not actually choose if and when we have our periods. We do not like throwing away our favorite pairs of underpants. Why are pads and tampons still taxed when Viagra and Rogaine are not? Is your erection really more than protecting the parts of my womanhood? Is the bloodstain on my jeans more embarrassing than the thinning of your hair?' Fun fact: Ashley didn't write this poem. It was written by a 19-year <b> old </b>young<b>  woman</b> from Tennessee.\n\nFighting for tax exemptions is just of the issues in which we, the privileged white girls, used our voices to bring to the forefront with the Women's March. We used our privileged voices to get people to pay attention. We used our privileged voices to stand up for the underprivileged...and I have a feeling that you are asking, \"What are they marching for, anyway? Women already have rights.\" To that, I say this: \n\nThis march is for people of all genders, races, ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds...people who are afraid to report a rape because others might not believe them. This is for my fellow plus sized women who will be denied jobs because the fitter women \"look smarter\". This is for the people who do all the work while the opposit<b> e gende</b>r boss takes the credit. (Yes, Hidden Figures is real, and still relevant.) This is for LBGTQ citizens who just want to love who they love and make it legal, just like you. This is for the young kids who don't have access to quality education and health care. This is for women who wear hijabs and endure the stares and secret suspicions of others. This is for t<b> he transgend</b>er <b> and<b>  </b</b>>gay teens who are beaten to death and hung to a fence because their attackers are afraid of what is different. This is fo<b> r the </b>woman who will lose her health insurance and will be diagnosed with cancer, who will have to choose between being treated and going bankrupt or dying. This is for people who have been sexually assaulted by a person in a powerful position (i.e., \"grab them by the pussy/balls\") This is for my young students who are terrified their parents will be sent back to Mexico, and because of the president's ignorance, they have learned to hate. This is for women who might lose access to free birth control while insurance companies continue to cover drugs like Viagra/Cialis. This is for vict<b> ims </b>of sex trafficking. This for the people of color who are unfairly treated by some members of the police force, and women of color who do not get equal pay to their white counterparts. \n\n*It important to note that these marches happened all over the world, perhaps among women who do not have any rights at all. *\n\nDuring his campaign, Mr. Trump clearly sent a message that he does not respect people who are different than what he sees in the mirror. He has verbally and nonverbally communicated negatively regarding women, hispanics, people of different religious faiths, immigrants, people with disabilities, and other marginalized groups. For example, he says women who have abortions \"need to be punished\". He says \"Mexicans\" are rapists, murderers, and drug dealers. Perhaps that's NOT what he MEANT, but that's what people HEARD. Some of my students are children of immigrants who hear these things and think their families will be broken up. They are scared. They listen to what their parents are talking about, and now have learned to hate. I now have to try and undo that. Now granted, he seems to have softened a bit on his stances since being elected, but people are scared. People are resentful. People are angry. They want to be acknowledged. \n\nAlthough he may not have meant harm by his statements, his rhetoric scares people who have fought for and earned equality rights...and anyone who has earned anything knows it can all be taken away by the stroke of a pen (remember The Tudors?), which could make a person angry and untrusting over time. As a white male, he was granted these rights just by being himself. For any other group, it has been a struggle. 500 years ago, daughters were sold to men to strengthen wealth and status for their fathers. Historically, our thoughts and opinions, and our desires were never valued as much as a man's, and it comes down to thoughts like, \"well, women already are equal, so what's the problem?\", which tells me t<b> hat the pat</b>riarchy is still alive and kicking, which is frustrating. Just because you may not have experienced it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. \n\nI'm not saying that everyone at the march was doing it for the right reasons. Hate speech and insulting the president will never get us to where we want to be, but that's what happens when members of these groups feel threatened, and Mr. Trump's lack of empathy and unapologetic attitude is alarming. \n\nWe can disagree on issues, which is completely fine, but bickering over the details just to get the last word in comment thread doesn't get to the real issue, which is: \"I see you. I recognize your struggle. I am with you. I support you. I value you. I will protect you.\" That's all anyone really wants...and claps for you if you're still reading this. Men, by the way, are more than welcome to organize a march and fight for your<b>  rights.</b> Nothing is stopping you.",

In my experience, the second I try to engage certain men in conversation, they clam up, don't know what to say, and instead of listening, call women names, like you said. It's a defense mechanism because they know we have a point, they just can't admit it. I find it funny and sad that some men just cannot have a conversation about it. They are so scared they will lose their masculinity and control. They are so scared that a <b> woman </b>might actually have ideas and solutions to problems in this world.

And then goes to Hollywood and meets Harvey Weinstein and then off to Marylyn Manson = Satanism, he gets lil darlings like her and once innocent and adorable Taylor Mommsen and deflowers and alters their intellectual make up. Rose IS EVEN MORE FUCKED UP THAN Mommsen SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN EARLIER ON IN LIFE! Rose is fucked up emotionally and now we all know why=Weinstein! and his company=I do not trust his brother either=he knew this was happening and still denies that! She chose this path! Mind you what choice did she ever have?so I always cut her some slack. I just hope she gets the real help she needs. All this I can do this all on my own stuff=or I'm so defiant and can cope and make a success is all very well. But is she really being practical? Therapy's a good start and very good friends around her. Just getting on a tv clip and swearing and bravado acts are not going to be enough........she must avoid ghetto wood.....becoming like Amanda Peterson Mc Gowan better stay off of drugs and <b> alcohol.</b> I worry for her. I'm saying she seems upset her and has a messed up life..",

They feel inadequate and competitive  around other men that have. Submissive Women make them feel better about themselves and their masculinity. When women aren't it makes them very angry. Because they feel more inadequate. Man struggle with women that make more than them, that are more educated or more intelligent than them. They struggle with women in power situation or women with more skill. Because of<b>  gender</b> roles and toxic masculinity. Man is supposed to be the bread winner. The protector. The handy man. They're supposed to be Alpha, a mans man. Captain of the football team not the captain of the debate team. They struggle with this perceived role and their place in the tribe. They want the cheerleader the hottest most popular girl in school because it will solidify their standing in the tribe. More conquests they get the more manly they are. When women don't give in they're stuck up bitches. That's why rape is about power, no<b> t se</b>x. Weak, powerless men, trying to exact their power on women. Releasing their anger and self loathing on women. True alphas aren't threatened by strong women. In fact they're attracted to them.\nTake George Clooney. Rich powerful successf<b> ul s</b>ex symbol that was a bachelor for years. Could have any women he wanted. Finally marries a brilliant strong human rights lawyer.

She's made them uncomfortable in their own masculinity.",

And it's creepy how she barely talked about her accident but talked about inconsequential shit instead.\nFuck, I hope she's like David O. Russell and is at least a good director that makes good films.\nSo it's sexualized women ISN'T sexist? '..., or, is it just sexist if a human with a cock and balls enjoys the sexualization? Or just when they want to show the sexuality of the female body? 'Cause first she was \"hypersexualized from a young <b> age\"</b> but later it's \"I wear what I want 'case I fucking wanna wear<b>  nothing</b>..:\" when talking about a dress that is literally stripper-wear, and that's supposedly \"empowering\". So...? Damned if you do, damned if you don't, I guess. It's not like aesthetic appeal is important for males and females, given that ugly actors never succeed 'cause audiences just don't respond to them despite whatever talent they might have, and it's not like Joseph Gordon Levitt, Ryan Gosling-type men are always having to promote their film through their sexuality as well, just to capitalize on it... but, hey, even if it weren't. Sexuality is freeing and empowering, ain't it?\nPraising the clothes of <b> a woma</b>n is bad too apparently. And, no, it's not just women, nowadays \"fashion\" is quite the mainstream topic and it<b> 's comm</b>on to see an article interview with Miles Teller, Chris Brown and their clothes being commented on, given that the current fads are from hip-hop culture that is incredibly materialistic and clothes are a big part of that. Shit, weren't Steve Jobs and Bill Gates' dress style iconic and always noted if they didn't wear them?\nShe's played 32 parts in 34 films she's done, and 11 roles in 11 TV shows, one of which she was in 112 episodes... but she doesn't \"identify\" as an actress? Just like Dolezal identifies<b>  as bl</b>ack, I guess...\nShe said the positive sid<b> e of se</b>xism that isn't focused on is progressiveness? The same women that is contributing her grain of sand by saying an image where Jennifer Lawrence is getting choked by Oscar Isaac promotes violence against women even though it's a film about mutants fighting to the death and Jennifer Lawrence playing a warrior... wouldn't the sexist thing be for Apocalypse to refuse to hit her only 'cause she's  female. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.\n\nI whined enough, I'm done...",

Besides, feminism is not about equality but bringing women to same level as men, which according to first world countries laws, has already happened. Egalitarian is for equality. \nFeminism is for whining and attention whoring while making everyone's life as miserable as possible.\nActions speak more than words of supposed \"Definition\".\n\nWhat happens in your life from the moment on you start your education makes the difference what happens for the rest of your life. If you choose to waste your time on <b> gender </b>studies instead of filing in to Stem fields or becoming a politician, you don't get to bitch and moan that \n\nAs for respect, just like men, you need to earn it. You don't automatically deserve it just because you have a vagina and you whine and moan like pig with a baseball bat in it's arse. Fucking work for it and stop being an attention whoring cunt about it.\n\nAnd if you want to be a feminist and earn my respect. Then go out there in to middle east and africa and start bringing rights for women in there. But as long as you are feminist in a first world country and whine about petty shit that no one gives a shit about then you have absolutely 0% of my and anyone else's respect.\n\nSo fucking go out there and work for it.",

The fight is against YOU treating ME as an object. So when there is n<b> o sexis</b>m, I can dress in a provocative way and I will not be harassed or sexually molested bc I, as a lady, need to be respected regardless of what you or anyone see in me.

In Hollywood, the name of the game is looking cute and pretty, or handsome. What.... you didn't know that? Or, do you just hate that\u00a0human nature and life\u00a0operates on so-called 'shallow' values. Well, sweetie, welcome to human nature. It basically stinks. And you're\u00a0the last to know? C'mon. Don't be so\u00a0clueless. Again.. I'm dumping on 'Rose' because\u00a0she was once very\u00a0beautiful. That was the ONLY reason she got where she got.\u00a0She didn't complain then. Did she? No, no back then she enjoyed it. She reveled in Hollywood. She loved it when she was a succulent young promising starlet with great beauty. But\u00a0sadly, <b> nothing </b>lasts forever. Beauty fades. And apparently, Rose is the one that's obsessed with this sad fact. Don't complain to Adam Sandler. Complain to Mother Nature. Because it is what it is. Can you grasp this? I know you won't, but only because you don't like that life is the way it is. It's not me you're mad at, is it really? Probably not. It's the fact that everything beautiful will eventually fade and become<b>  old</b> and ugly. It's just a fact of life tha<b> t nobod</b>y likes. But it's not Adam Sandler's or Hollywood's fault.",

There's value to be found in intelligence and humour, as well as  patience and empathy and thoughtfulness, which are qualities so lacking in many of today's celebrities. A corollary of Hollywood's narrow appreciation of beauty is that they overrepresent young actors, to the point that 30 has become a cut-off point at which an actor is termed<b>  \"ol</b>d\". Yes, our hair gets grey, but it doesn't mean we become worthless or ugly. Look at how beautiful Audrey Hepburn remained through her 50s and 60s. It was at that point in her career that she turned her attention to humanitarian causes, and showed more of her inward beauty in doing so. \n\nYou're right that Hollywood places immense focus on physical beauty, but you are wrong to passively accept that \"that's just the way things are\". It doesn't have to be that way. We shouldn't be passive endorsers of that mentality. It's stifling to art and to creative progress. Beauty is boring. It doesn't represent reality; life is often ugly, and beauty has to (and can) be found in things which at first glance may appear ugly. But Hollywood ignores that fact, and so we get patronising, vacuous movies like Entourage or Fast and Furious 7 shoved down our throats, and WE are the fools for mindlessly buying into it and funding Hollywood's shallowness. \n\nTo go back to Rose McGowan, I agree that in recent interviews she has come across as very bitter. There possibly have been personal events in her life which have made her this way, and it is not our business to pry into them or mistreat her in the way that some people have. She is not a bitch or <b> a \"femina</b>zi\", whatever the fuck that means. She's a human being with flaws like everyone else, but at least she's honest about them. She doesn't put on a false grin, or dress up to impress the audience, or act like everything's fine to please her publicist. I admire that hugely. She sees major issues in Hollywood, just as her counterparts like Bret Easton Ellis and Quentin Tarantino have pointed out (and similarly been lambasted), and she does the right thing by speaking out about it. \nAnd your idea of beauty is so dull. If you see interviews with Rose in the 90s, she's just wearing a non-descr<b> ipt bl</b>ack shirt<b>  and b</b>lack jeans and yet she's so beautiful because she's intelligent and knowledgabl<b> e and </b>weird and funny and can sustain an interesting conversation. Those are human attributes which are MORE valuable than how a person looks because they will not fade, and they will only grow stronger as a person gets older.",

It is nature that makes guys attracted to YOUNG AND PRETTY girls. No kidding there's still value in older women. That's just stupid to point that out. <b> Nobody </b>says after a<b>  woman</b> is past her physical prime she's useless. But nature makes some things SEXUALLY attractive and some things not sexually attractive. All I am saying is 'Hollywood', or any industry, will capitalize on that fact for potential profit. You try to sell clothing wit<b> h fa</b>t or ugly people modeling them. You're a liar if you pretend it makes no difference. That's just bei<b> ng bli</b>nd to reality because you dislike the cruel nature of reality. I understand you don't like that nature is not fair. Some women will get to enjoy being beautiful and desirable. And the same goes for some men. Some men, too, will enjoy being handsome and they'll enjoy having that degree of power. You can't deny physical beauty exists. All I am saying is 'Rose' capitalized on her physical beauty. She milked it when she had it. She's older now. Is that in debate? Do you debate she's not quite as pretty as she was when she was, say, 20? You see, you will debate that. Because you'll combine beauty of all forms into the equation. And I'm only talking about physical beauty, the kind we colloquially call being HOT, or sexually attractive. You know damn well what I'm talking about. Obviously older women are still 'beautiful', but clearly in other ways. C'mon. Let's not play semantics with words. And I don't like this reality of life any more than you. But I won't blame 'Hollywood' for it, or any business. Basically what does 'Rose' expect? Does she expect to play the hot and cute babe roles forever? Because she played those when she was young. And now she's older. What's the problem? Why can't she move on to play more motherly roles? We both know you're all just angry that reality does have something called physical beauty. And not all men and not all women get it. It's just luck. And, it's a curse, too. Because physical beauty will fade with the certainty of what goes up must come down. And it's hard to complain to nature. So we'll blame 'Hollywood'.",

Of course she doesn't look like she used to partly because of aging and perhaps partly because cameras are much better these days. \nWe can only hope that one day these scientists find a way to reverse the aging process at least aesthetically. Until then, beauty is fleeting. If you get too attached to it, it can cause major psychological issues. Like femininism.",

Maybe if she worked with people who let her express\u00a0this side of her, acting would be something she could love!",

No because she's a super hot Asian broad with a nice rack and huge dick sucking lips. That's why. \n\nLOLZ Her entire career is about her ass and now, it's so horrible and terrible and awful and Omg! That's hilarious. \n\nThe PC level is just absurd now. I've tolerated for years. If you didn't like the industry you were in, then she shoulda gotten the FUCK OUT OF IT. But the American way, instead of doing something based on merit and talent is, just do anything to make it, be a lousy whore and then become a victim and complain complain complain. Every single one of you entitled, pissy poor, passive aggressive, loathing vagina owners should really wake up and be so thankful for what you have. No life isn't perfect for anyone, male or female. In fact, instead of the never ending whining, consider how lucky you are that you aren't in Afghanistan or India or Syria or one of these countries where women are bought and sold for marriage at 12 or killed by their own families for marrying a guy that she really loves. I feel so sorry for any guy out there who just wants some <b> sex </b>and a family then has to lock horns with a miserable talentless rake like this for the rest of eternity. \n\nThe reality is, in many years, this rake is going to be doing an interview and she's gonna be talking about her dad didn't love her and he only was into his cult and didn't spend any time with her. THAT is the real source of her anger. I am 100% sure I am right about that. She's upset for going to Hollywood and being treated like a<b>  sex</b> object? Ok, that, makes sense.....?",

Your conscious mind - that you use to navigate a society trying to be politically correct - will never admit that there's a personal and painful reason why you dislike women showing strength - even if it's crude strength.

You know, the 1800s was not that far ago!\n\nWhat I wanted to say, is that taking a woman's words at face value is not enough. So going back to the interview: McGowan says many things but it just doesn't sound right. Meaning that deep down she seems to still hold on to Hollywood \"values\" but for some reason she criticizes them vehemently. So vehemently, that it's suspicious. And this violent split between the explicit message and the stuff actually at play is what hysteria is about. My guess, is that she feels guilty because of all the enjoyment that these Hollywood years brought her. Another scenario, is that she can't stand that because of her <b> age </b>or whatever her HW career is virtually over.\n\nHaving said that, criticism of HW is something very positive; besides Bret Easton Ellis, the guys from South Park and Marilyn Manson I can't really think of other rebel HW insiders.",

So, there were completely unsatisfied women everywhere (hint: women get \"blue balls\" too, but our \"balls\" are ovaries}.

There was no social media or Internet to spread the knowledge of this existence until quite recently and there was little to no social acceptance of it so many, many people lived in the shadows with their true selves. I think that is tremendously sad; to never be ones true self outside of his/her home. Look up Michaelangelo (yes the openly <b> homosexual </b> artist). He wrote many poems discussing his<b>  sexual</b> orientation (\"Tommaso dei Cavilieri\" is the title of one of his poems). I do speak French and will look up the philosopher, but I do not like capitalism or consumerism for that matter. I think that many people focus more on greed and things than they do on other people and that is, at least, ethically wrong.",

Feminists from the Womens' Dept. of the Students' Union had her de-platformed and labeled a 'Misogynist'.

On the \"B side\" of that terrible record is the idea that you want women, like women want tampons, you stick it in and when you're done using it you dump it in the trash (after you pay for it, of course). The only other layer to this horrible thing is that you seemingly never want to have an emotional connection with someone you are intimate with. That latter concept is the one that I find the most horrific of all. I would rather NEVER be intimate again than to be intimate to someone who cared less about me than the cobweb in the corner that they stared at while I \"got my rocks off\". I echo what I said before; this concept is one of someone who has emotionally given up on being in a real relationship and is therefore, completely tragic. I am sorry for whoever hurt you so badly that you would rather only deal with prostitutes.",

It completely undermines the emotional intimacy until all that is left are two combatants with their guard up. It is no way to live at all. \n\nEquality between men and women should be economic, because that has been the primary problem for women; being unable to afford to CHOOSE what they want to do. If there is economic equality, much fewer women will be stuck in relationships they no longer want or may not enter a potentially bad situation because they need the resources of a man to survive. They will have their own. You should freely be able to choose to be with someone. I think THAT applies equally to men and women.",

In my mind, hitting is the ultimate act of disrespect between adults and also a sign that you have utterly given up on communication or that you are incapable of communicating adequately, and maturely.\n\nI get what you are saying, but most men are proportionally stronger than women of similar height and build. So, when a<b>  woman</b> slaps a man (it's wrong, and I wouldn't do it), it is a strong man (emotionally and mentally) that walks away and doesn't retaliate physically.\n\nThe only reason I ever raised a hand to my ex was because I was very young and didn't really know better at the time, and also to defend myself.

I personally do feel that white people are ignorant on the issues that plague minorities. But I don't think it makes them <b> racist.</b> I think people confuse<b>  racism</b> with ignorance. We are all ignorant in some things. Like before I met my husband I didn't know what an IRA was. But he also  didn't know and want to understand the struggles of my people. ( Me being antive American and from the Rez) I have tried and tried to explain how we get treated differently and he doesn't understand the concept not he can change his clothes verses I can't change my features or skin color. Even though I'm pretty pale. Lol I understand where the frustration of both sides. I am native and I still have people call m<b> e India</b>n. We are not indians we are first Nations , native Americans. This confuses me as I have people refuse after I educate them and tell them what is the preferred term and they still refuse to and call <b> me Indi</b>an.  So I understand both sides but I feel we a<b> s a nat</b>ion and people should be more understanding and have compassion for one another and learn to listen more! \ud83d\ude00 So I feel for your struggle and it definitely isn't right. There is a saying I've been really into and I think we all can follow it more is that God gave us one mouth and 2 ears lol!",

To be honest I have had several job interviews in my career with both men and women, women bosses never hired me. Only men would give me the chance. Should I now say \"some women\" are sexist and cannot handle being in charge? They could not handle a \"real\" man under them? It is as stupid of a comment as yours. In that case I should have the self reflection to see I might have given off a bad vibe or simply was not fit for that job or something else. It might just be me and hence I should not rush to judgement like you do in your original post. \nI would suggest to stop this victim mentality altogether, crying about how you experience life. \nPeople should look in a mirror more often and get some self reflection and perspective.  \nAnd grow some spine, call them assholes and move on, instead of this whining about how things are, things that never will change. People are different, some will upset you, others will support you. That is just a part of life.",

In my original comment I was responding to what I was reading in the main comments under this video. It was a response only and not a grand statement about <b> gender.</b> I liked Rose's pissed off vibe. That was my point. Additionally only SOME of the men were saying stupid things because she has a bit of a chip on her shoulders. I had lovely exchanges on other comment streams with men who did NOT like how she presented herself. I know that there are bitches and assholes everywhere, perhaps you might consider trying to talk as opposed to trying to attack, but either way I think that road rage, neither belongs on the road nor the internet.",

Men are wired to seduce women... if a women does not want to be seduced, who cares, we move on to the next women. But if a women who does not want to be seduced challenges a man on ANY level in the same way a man would, then we react giving her the same NATURAL feed back we give other MEN who challenge our nature. Women want men to let them treat us any way they want but don't want to deal with what comes with it saying \"Why would you say such a thing to me you PIG I'm still a <b> woman </b>so you're<b>  nothing</b> but a fucking MONSTER let me do/say whatever I want and don't judge me!!\".... Listen, if you are a girl... and you argue with EVERY official until they let you put on football pads and get on the field... you're getting hit because YOU ARE ON THE FIELD not because you're a women... stop challenging our nature WE ARE NOT OTHER WOMEN we are naturally dominant so we do not back down from your bullshit like other more feminine/docile women do. And NO I don't support beating women read between the fucking lines. STOP BITCHING and just DO whatever the fuck you want. Acting TOUGH and then getting mad at our words is something FEMALES do which is precisely why both men AND women who do that are called little bitches. You learn something new every day so let that burn and keep fucking scrolling.",

There's a lot of judgment from men who call the women who did submit to Weinstein and others \"whores\", as if that's all there is to it and the pervasive culture of <b> sexual </b>privilege isn't a problem in many industries, where to get anywhere women have to put up with crude remarks at the least, groping and accosting, and requests for<b>  sexual</b> favours at the worst. It's a culture where if many women want to get anywhere, especially in the past, they HAD to submit, or risk their careers and possibly even livelihoods.\n\nI tried asking another man what he would do in the same situation and he just ignored my question and insisted all those women where prostitutes and whores etc. I guess the only ones who were sexually involved with these men who get off innocent in their eyes are full-on rape victims, because you know, women obviously have 100% choice unless they're physically forced int<b> o se</b>x. Or they have to be saintly and hold themselves to standards most men are never asked to in such situations. It's a very bizarre worldview and unfortunately shows us that male privilege is alive and well. \n\nBtw I'm a man, and most men do not feel the way comment sections show. Comment sections bring out the worst in the men who post. Even face-to-face a lot of the posters would act differently.",

Yet, gullible fools like you still believe in all her childish lies, you brainwashed sheep, without having been there to know what really happened.

Ryan Gosling and Michael Fassbender are top quality actors, but I can guarantee they wouldn't be so successful if they weren't so handsome. This is because people, both male and female, like to look at attractive people, so the movies are a reflection of that. They base their bankability on appealing to people's tastes and desires.\u00a0 A number of the really good actors do find steady work and money regardless, and this applies to both genders. What people like McGowan are whinging about are purely 1st World \"problems\", i.e. not getting their cake and being able to eat it with two different sets of cutlery. Most of the leading (i.e. most respected) and most bankable actors in Hollywood at the moment are female. What are you complaining about? If you were to make a rational point, such as complaining that there ought to be more male nudity in films to counterbalance female nudity, I'd entirely agree, but even then the disproportion there is sexist for different reasons than you'd imagine. It used to be down to male-dominated prudery, but now it's mostly down to the demonisation of the naked male body that has occurred under institutionalism of Political Correctness and the madness of Rad Fem.",

But I liked it!\n\nJust a note to all you pretty girls who would not have been given the access to the fame, fortune, opportunities, stress and drama.. if it were not for you being pretty and using it as you ticket for a spell.. It's just not cool later on down the road to suggest that you were cooerced, used, abused and hoodwinked into becoming a hollywood\u00a0\"it girl\" starlet.\u00a0\n\nTry tho I might've, my <b> fat </b>ugly pimply ass would have never made it thru the gate to clean the toilets in a hollywood studio if I offered to pay them to let me do it! Your beauty, youthful sexiness and your employment of it's charms got you access, favors, fame and made you wealthy and saved you from working a 9-to-5 at Walmart as a way to earn a living... Few get that opportunity.. Then there is the idea that anyone can say \"no\" at anytime.. which I suspect eventually many do..but until then, they are complicit in going for the ride.\u00a0\n\nI remember that \u00a0VMA award show outfit with Marylyn Manson.. I almost broke my dick from overuse when Rose flaunted herself in that outfit with that satinist<b> \u00a0weirdo</b>.. Gosh, what a sweet badonk\u00a0she had and encouraged us all to fantasize about. I was glued to the screen as you wiggled, shaked, shimmied and twirled so that we all could get a good look and drool.. Own it girl! But dont\u00a0claim you didnt\u00a0know the effect it would have and that you enjoyed it and basked in the glow during your time in the sun!\n\nHollywood is full of horrors, corruption, illegality, the ready attending of vices.. hurry up an write that book or make that movie to let us in to what you've seen if you found cause to hint at it's wickedness early in the interview.\n\nOkay Broadly, you got me to watch two vids today..\u00a0\n\nkeep bringing pretty girls with sweet bodies and pretty faces and I'll watch more.\n\nOh..and the interviewer... Way too much makeup! But I suspect that's the point and its the festoonery of your ideology and politics.. that along with the nose ring.. No decent boy/girl will kiss you with that thing in there!\n\nlol..",

You need to be able to articulate your perspective and vision to a great multitude of people, who are mostly conceited arrogant assholes, what you want them to do. She has a huge chip on her shoulders, obviously, and is not very articulate. She doesn't seem capable of allowing her ego to take a back seat. Clearly. She is acting in this interview, making statements to gather attention and therefore be able to do something else since she has almost no career. Probably someone, due to the achieved attention she is getting from this new career move, will give her a shot, and it will most likely be average at best. Wanna bet?! I know what I'm talking about. Believe me. I'm not just bullshitting you.",

Hollywood movies are not a women's problem, they are a civilizational problem. Hollywood is not about quality, respectfulness, classiness, creativeness, artfulness... Hollywood is a government-sponsored propaganda machine that churns out crap for audiences with low expectations, keeping them docile and occupied like the Colosseum in ancient Rome. Hollywood entrains the minds of young children into becoming CGI-addicted zombies with low expectations on movies and on life in general, which is how you get them not to become overly critical, socially conscious and rebellious once they grow up. All these drug-addicted, depressed, self-medicating \"movie stars\" are just part of the problem, not part of the solution.",

Seriously look up studies where they have shown that resumes with a male versus female name are viewed differently even though it's the exact same qualifications. (And the same applies to<b>  \"Ethni</b>c sounding\" versus Euro-centric names). The same amount work is also perceived differently since women are perceived as \"enjoying\" being \"helpful\" with domestic projects or extra work, whereas men are often rewarded with praise or even raises for \"going above and beyond\" because it is not socially expected of them. Again, this has been proven in studies.",

There is no right or wrong. There is no universal. There are only individuals. And more accurately, there is only that which can conceive as individuality. Go ahead now, ban/report me.",

They just dig in. But so what? We get the rights we fight for; nothing's guaranteed. Sometimes we DO in fact have to fight others who would oppress us. It's not about changing them - FUCK 'em. It's about asserting our own rights. But YES, the end goal is to change society, not by \"expecting others to change,\" but by showing them that we won't be pushed around, and by taking them the fuck out if they make it necessary.\n\nDr. King was the public relations face of \"racial equality,\" and it was all about \"peaceful protest,\" right? But he WAS backed up by others who were quite prepared to use force and violence, and he more than likely wouldn't have been successful had racists not known that they DID have a real fight on their hands if they didn't back down.\n\nAgain,<b>  nobody</b> thinks we can \"change\" ISIS militants. We just want to fucking destroy those assholes. We want to change their minds by scattering the atoms of which they're composed. Incidentally, they're on basically the same program. But as you say, there's no morality, so the people who win will be the people who win. So who do YOU want to win? Might turn out that there's a species of morality and values after all.\n\nSorry, but when I read a remark like yours, I feel like it's coming from somebody who's maybe read a few books by people who call themselves \"libertarians,\" but are really just the standard bigots who are irritated by minorities getting \"uppity,\" and are just intelligent enough to pseudo-intellectualize and lionize it as some kind of trans-moral, rugged individual rap, taking a stand against minority \"oppression.\"",

As if I didn't go out of my way to distinguish myself from the sort of sap who blathers on about \"shaming\" as an excuse for bad behavior. It's not that there isn't a valid critique of \"PCness\" - but it still bears pointing out that most of the people who whine about the \"PC police\" ARE in fact just bigots who hate being criticized for THAT. But, fuck 'em - that's my point. I'm not the least bit interested in trying to change their minds. Not trying to change yours either - just having a philosophical discussion here...lol. \n\nTo repeat myself, since I guess I have to, people get the rights they FIGHT for. It's not about changing other people, it's about standing up for \"oneself.\" Decades on from Civil Rights legislation, and there are still plenty of racists in America - you CAN'T legislate enlightenment. But you CAN make it illegal to deny rights to people based on <b> race,</b> if you fight for that hard enough. And of course the racists will hate you for it, and call you names and insist that THEY'RE being oppressed by your denial of their prerogative to oppress you...but FUCK 'EM! (I'm not<b>  black</b> either...lol. These are actual principles, not me trying to arbitrarily make myself the center of the universe to whom everybody else must kowtow.)\n\nSpeaking of which, as for calling people bigots, it's just a case of \"if the jumper fits\" (Kim Davis reference). It's an English word with a definite meaning. I mean, I routinely see \"conservatives\" in comment sections saying things like \"Laz<b> y blac</b>k welfare queen thugs are the REAL racists!\" without a trace of irony. Touche.\n\nBTW there's a reason for a bigot to transcend his bigotry for his own sake - because bigotry is a form of willed stupidity. Muslim theocrats e.g. deny themselves the talents and contributions of fully half of the population because of their retarded (literally) notions about women. It's their own loss as well as the women's.",

And the latest CHAIN figures suggest that 9 out of 10 people sleeping rough are male.\n\nAccording to Mankind Initiative in UK refuges or safe houses, there are 33 spaces dedicated to male victims of domestic violence (of which 18 are for <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>males only), compared to around 4,000 spaces reserved for females.\n\n\u00a0the purpose of feminism \u2013 not to \"ignore men and try to eliminate masculinity\" (where do you even get that from?)\n\n1) Degradation of Positive Masculine Role Models\n\n50 years ago, advertising, Hollywood and television was filled with examples of positive masculine role models that young men could look up to, today's entertainment industry routinely portrays men as clueless and bumbling oafs at best (think Homer Simpson, Everybody Loves Raymond, Married With Children) or at worst as aggressiv<b> e sexua</b>l predators. Since advertising is primarily aimed at women, men in commercials are also now routinely depicted as either being emasculated losers or stupefied morons. Young men consuming this content grow up thinking that it is acceptable and even encouraged to aspire to these character traits. In doing so, they are robbed of their natural masculinity and find it extremely difficult to attract well-rounded women, who are rightly disgusted by such behavior. The entertainment industry is largely controlled by men, again underscoring the fact that this assault is a top down trend that has little <b> or nothi</b>ng to do with <b> the gen</b>der war.\n\nSecond wave feminism was a creation of the establishment itself and at its core has little whatsoever to do with genuine concern about women's rights. Radical feminism deliberately conf<b> uses ge</b>nder roles and makes young men apprehensive about exercising their masculinity for fear of being seen as overbearing or aggressive towards women. This has contributed to an entire generation of 'metrosexual' men wh<b> o are promis</b>cuous, unwilling to commit to a relationship and unable to fulfil a women's basic needs for healthy companionship, destabilizing society and making it more difficult for women to find suitable long term partners with whom to have children.\n\n2) Masculinity as a Dirty Word\n\nDissident feminist Camille Paglia recently wrote a Wall Street Journal piece in which she warned, 'What you're seeing is how a civilization commits suicide.' Paglia was referring to how the emancipation of masculine virtues by the establishment threatens to create massive destabilization in society due to less and less men being able to fill traditionally 'masculine' roles in the jobs market. Paglia points to schools cutting recess, the effort to deny the biological distinctions between men and women, and the left's characterization of controversial opinions as 'hate speech' as examples of how masculinity is being deliberately eroded. 'Masculinity is just becoming something that is imitated from the movies. T<b> here's n</b>othing left. There's no room for anything manly right now,' warns Paglia, adding that young men have, 'no models of manhood.\n\n\nwould you ever consider calling women dicks, cocks, dickheads, pricks, wankers etc., the way you call men pussies and cunts? (Well, maybe you would, although I doubt it.) And why is that, do you think? Something about things associated with women being thought of as worse or lesser than things associated with men \u2026 ?\u00a0\n\nVaginas are \"worse or lesser\" than things associated with men!\u00a0\n\n1)vaginas bleed once a month, that would be a risk<b>  if the pat</b>riarchy hadn't helped to get us out of the wild and away from wild animals!\n\n2) vaginas get fucked/penetrated, which is why we view it as submissive, something few men want to be seen as is submissive!",
