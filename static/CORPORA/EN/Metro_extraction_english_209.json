        "postText": "A makeshift campsite full of homeless migrants in one of the capital\u2019s wealthiest area has been cleared by police following a recent surge in crime.', 'Police stood by as the rough sleepers in Marble Arch, Mayfair were ordered to leave the Transport for London owned land.', 'Many of the mostly Romanian and Bulgarian campers shifted their cardboard mattresses and tents to nearby Park Lane.', 'It comes after a hike of reports of muggings, begging, pick pocketing, sexual assaults and anti-social behaviour in the area.', 'But local councillors have warned against automatically blaming the crime wave on those living in the \u2018tent city\u2019.', 'The campers have managed to avoid deportation thanks to a High Court ruling in 2017.', 'Home Office policy says deporting rough sleepers who are EU citizens is unlawful and against freedom of movement rules.', 'As people took their belongings away in shopping trolleys, a man named Dan was seen with a 32 inch plasma TV which he hoped to sell \u2018for a few hundred pounds,\u2019 reports the Telegraph.', 'He said he did not want to return to Romania, despite living with no money, food or job in the UK.', 'Transport for London said it made several attempts to offer alternative accommodation before resorting to the court order.', 'Police kept an eye out for potential cases of modern slavery as they oversaw the eviction on Thursday.', 'Figures from the Metropolitan Police reveal 872 violent and sexual crimes were reported in the 12 months to July \u2013 a rate of more than two a day.', 'There were more than 80 cases of shoplifting a week and one robbery per day on average.', 'But Westminster Conservative councillor Ian Adams has warned against blaming Romanian and Bulgarian rough sleepers for the rise in crime.', 'He said: \u2018The council very much recognises and shares the concerns of residents and businesses \u2026 around current levels of crime whether that is theft, robbery or other crimes.', '\u2018Mayfair is increasingly becoming a magnet for the nighttime economy. It attracts a lot of wealthy people who are being targeted because of the expensive jewellery they are wearing.\u2019', 'He said more police officers have been promised for the area with a focus on tackling robberies.', 'A Westminster City Council spokesman told Metro.co.uk: \u2018The crime statistics we\u2019re seeing underline what we have always said \u2013 that we need more visible officers on the streets.', '\u2018The police out there are doing a great job and work very hard, but they need reinforced now \u2013 there just aren\u2019t enough of them.', '\u2018The 6,000 officers we understand are promised for London can\u2019t come soon enough. We absolutely understand residents\u2019 concern.', '\u2018We are seeing numbers of rough sleepers rising, and a significant number of those are EEA nationals.', '\u2018But what we are seeing in Mayfair appears more organised gang crime, we can\u2019t conflate that with rough sleeping.\u2019",
