        "postText": "November is a particularly hard month for trans people. Today marks Transgender Day of Remembrance, a day where we remember those murdered for simply being trans.', 'This year a shocking figure of 369 trans people were reported murdered, and 28 of those were young people under the age of 20.', 'Since 2008 there have been 2982 reported murders and 11% of those were young people under the age of 20. But these reported cases are only the tip of the iceberg. Trans people around the world face heightened levels of grotesque hate driven violence, sexual abuse, discrimination and exclusion from within their families and society in general \u2014 and young trans people are no exception. In fact, a body of research shows alarmingly high suicide rates among trans youth \u2014 with Stonewall finding that up to 45% of trans youth in the UK having attempted suicide.', 'This is directly related to them not being supported by their families or their school, and being bullied by their peers. While many schools are doing well at supporting their trans students, there is still a long way to go. School is often the first institution that kids enter, and having their gender identity disregarded while at school can have really severe consequences to their mental health, making them more likely to drop out of education.', 'This, on top of lack of family acceptance, can lead to further isolation, making them vulnerable to homelessness, and with no means of making an income. With anti-trans groups distributing a school guide to schools around the country on \u2018how to support trans students\u2019 (or not) \u2014 described as \u2018dangerous\u2019, \u2018deeply damaging\u2019 and \u2018factually inaccurate\u2019 by Stonewall, the biggest LGBT charity in the country \u2014 trans children need our support more than ever.Despite award-winning research by a University of Washington professor showing that trans kids and teenagers show the same level of depression and anxiety as their peers when they are supported in their expression and identity, a handful of vocal anti-trans groups have successfully created a moral panic about trans kids in the UK press.', 'A teacher recently irresponsibly claimed that kids are being \u2018groomed\u2019 by trans people, a dog-whistle term used to describe it when pedophiles lure innocent children to sexually abuse them.', 'Trans people are accused of preying on and influencing young children, and autistic children in particular.', 'What this discourse reveals are deeply embedded negative values towards LGBT people, as well as the ableist view that autistic people don\u2019t know who they are. People can indeed be trans and autistic \u2014 they don\u2019t cancel each other out.To suggest that you can somehow influence someone to be trans is identical to the idea that you can influence someone to be a gay, a rhetoric that lead to Section 28, one of the darkest and most damaging legislation the UK has ever passed, which prevented homosexuality being \u2018promoted\u2019 in schools. Accessing trans related health as a transgender teenager in the UK today is notoriously difficult, with waiting lists often exceeding over 18 months for a first appointment.', 'Following on from that is a rigorous and intense assessment, eventually leading to access to puberty blockers. Those that get access to puberty blockers are only on them for a few years maximum, or until they are about 16.', 'Only after they are 16 can they access cross sex hormones if they wish for it, and only after the age of 18 (often much later due to long waiting times) can they access surgery.', 'In comparison, at the age of 16 people can get married, buy premium bonds, drink alcohol, drive a moped and fly a glider \u2014 and you guessed it, consent to medical treatment.', 'According to NHS guidelines puberty blockers are safe for children to take, with no proven long-term side effects if treatment is given correctly and monitored closely.', 'No child is given this treatment without the utmost care of health care professionals. It is done with the support of research, best practice and with the expertise of health care professionals in their respective field.', 'The increase of trans children accessing services isn\u2019t because it\u2019s the newest trend, it\u2019s because they can finally seek the support that they need at this age. Trans people no longer have to suffer in silence for the majority of their lives due to shame, stigma and ignorance.I often think of that the trans child I used to be, unable to articulate and explain to the world who I was.', 'I wish that my school would\u2019ve have taught me about LGBT issues, much like Scotland intends to do in their schools.', 'It would\u2019ve given me the knowledge, confidence and agency to speak with my parents and eventually get the support I needed. It certainly would\u2019ve saved me years of distress, agony and shame.', 'I want to dedicate this Transgender Day of Remembrance to the younger generation of trans people and to a much brighter future, where trans people are respected and listened to.', 'Let\u2019s not repeat history \u2014 let\u2019s listen to the needs of our children and teenagers now, before it\u2019s too late. Let\u2019s raise a new generation of young people that are supported, loved and understood. All young people deserve to live life to the fullest, trans young people included.', 'Update 23/11/18: This piece has been updated to include a link to the NHS Gender Indentity Development Service\u2019s information on the impact of puberty blockers.",
