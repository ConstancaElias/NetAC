This isn't a commentary about Korea as a whole, backed up by any polls or stats or facts or anything.  We've lived here for five years: what's it been like for us?  Have we experienced sexism in any way? Let us know your thoughts on the matter as well.  It's a serious topic, one that can't be done justice with just our perspective on it, so let us know what you think in the comments.

Even they put subtitle like ' a girl in this video suicided '. Here women get paid 60% of guys but guys still want women do house work. And if <b> woman </b>is not pretty they are not even treated as a human. That's why plastic surgery is so big in  korea. But you can see a lot of korean guys are fugly, short, wearing glass, having a small dick:) they want girls just stay pretty and do<b>  nothing</b>. Here korean guys hate intelligent or funny or tall or feminist women.",

I was with my twin sister and some big <b> fat </b>bouncer really wanted us to go in the club, even though we were 18, so we were technically still minors there (and he saw our ID too, I think). He actually didn't even drag me inside, but just held my arm outside the club and didn't let go, probably waiting for some agreement. In the end he finally did let go, and we left. It's a shame because we would have been interested if he wasn't being rude like that.",

However, it's not like I don't have Korean guy friends or never dated Korean guys... In fact, I grew up in Korea and have family & friends there, thus still visit Korea often. The girl who was surprised by your simple gesture seems VERY exaggerated but maybe she's from a super oddly mysogynistic family?? Unless all of my Korean female friends and family members are way more aggressive or confident than the rest of Korean women, I seriously cannot think of any one who would be so moved by such simple gesture like she did. Same thing goes to Korean guys - at least out of people I know even including my grandfather, I can't think of that much of douche bags who wouldn't even grab a glass. Plus, being sweet, nice, and caring has been the virtue for Korean guys for a long time now.

Also, could the higher rates of rape that you suggest in States, Canada, etc. (as I haven't fact-check them) be the results of a more comfortable environment for reporting assault and rape?  And Japan to me seems a little worse than South Korea concerning this topic.  Rape is often in anime and has been the theme of video games and even restaurants.  Additionally,  the Japanese still have underage girl anime porn for sale.  In the RapeLay game, players actually rape women...that's the point.  I'm glad that Korea hasn't gone in that direction.  I love Japan for so many reasons, but there's a really disturbing side to any culture.",

I agree that pulling them in is not a proper way to invite customers, but don't worry, they let go if you clearly say no. I'm not trying to defend the guys who do that, but I just want to tell you that it's not like how criminals are trying to abduct you by forcing you into a car and drive off. Plus, women do it as well. I've heard women are admitted into clubs for free of charge in Korea (not entirely sure though), so the bouncers are trying to convince them to come in because it's free and they have <b> nothing </b>to lose. And the reason they let go of foreign women is probably because the bouncers can't speak the foreign languages, not necessarily because they think foreign women are tougher.",

In real life that is DEFINITELY not the way to make a girl like you its more a way of getting a broken nose and for her to never speak to you again but I really hope guys do not just look at that and think that's ok because it definitely isn't and can really traumatise a girl",

It is because handshakes are just not as commonplace as they are in Western countries. In US, when we first meet somebody in a semi-professional or professional setting, we'll shake their hand. In Korea, we'll bow. Thus, since the whole \"shaking the hand\" concept is not as <b> common,</b> some people are just careful to initiate a handshake. \n\nEspecially because the shows that you come out on or the meetings you attend, you are accompanied by your husband. They are most likely not shaking your hand out of courtesy because in Korea, men simply do not shake somebody's wife's hand or touch them at all.",

Martina, I sometimes watch a vlogger Ryan Boundless, but have stopped because he is always so negative. Anyway, he feels as a foreigner that people won't answer him even thought he speaks fluently, they answer to his native girlfriend the way that interviewers/execs respond to you through Simon. I think it is extremely saddening. America has plenty o<b> f sexis</b>m too, but nowadays here even sexist people wanna seem politically correct. The other thing I've heard of is girls getting inappropriately touched/confronted/looked at/filmed on the subway especially. Men act like they fall asleep, and roll into<b>  a wom</b>an in the train seat beside them and touch their body. Filming up skirts. \"Bumping\" into someone's genitals and blaming it on the train. Men exposing themselves. I know if this happened on an empty train car in the states, that likely the same thing would happen in both places, but I feel like the Eastern cultures have a sort of \"Don't get involved\" rule, where no matter what harassment someone might give a stranger, you don't step in except absolutely necessary. A dr<b> unk </b>old man will verbally harass a female foreigner, and because they don't want trouble no one else who witnesses it says anything. A man fakes falling asleep next to a y<b> oung w</b>oman and \"falls\" into her lap and still stays \"asleep\".... The whole car sees it but no one tells him to knock it off and quit being a creep. I get the crime in general is lower, but...the stories I hear scare me. I feel like maybe if you DID defend someone you could maybe end up in trouble for it. Maybe I am completely off-base and the stories I heard are the rare negatives... but if there is even a small grain of truth, I hope it changes soon, that women are respected as equals, that people stand up for each other and do to each other as they'd have done to them.",

When I went to America to work there, I remember that I was very confused when people shacked my hand. I thought like \"but.. but... only men can do it.. what's happening?...\" So yeah, that kinda very cultural. But I think that it comes from the history.  Centuries ago this move showed your partner that you have no weapon in your hand to fight agains him. Women rarely had any weapons so there was just no sense in shaking  hands with them. I think so..",

I used to work in an international company and I was told not to talk to females when there was a man present because she might be his wife or girlfriend and he might think I was flirting with her and my female co-workers were told the opposite so they should not talk directly to a man if there was a female with him for the same reason. I live in Chile and i was told that this rules was even more important in the case of asian couples or groups. So i think it is stil a kind of <b> sexism </b>just not only related to females but also to males.",

I love the unbiased approach you have when it comes to being a foreigner and speaking about rather controversial topics.",

Concidering my own experience in Germany with shaking hands, here it's the complete opposite: Imagine, for religious reasons, I don't want to shake a guys hand but in order to not insult him, I deliberately carry something in both hands. That guy will seriously wait for me to put down my stuff and reach out to shake hands. When I then try to explaing that I don't shake men's hands, he'll get offended as if I was descriminative against him. Meanwhile it is very <b> common </b>to shake hands all around the world, I think we need to be respectful towards other contrie's and culture's ways of life. Even if they seem annoying to us. I imagine it was really offensive when the host was completely ignoring Martina, but maybe it helps if you remember - it's<b>  nothing</b> personal. It's just the way they do^^",

If men can't respect me for the beautiful and unique individual person I am,then I won't respect you AT ALL since you don't deserve it. Everyone is equal, no one should be brought to a lower level than others just because one had a more dominant <b> sex </b>than others. The I deal of men having more power is completely idiotic and irrational. Women make the biggest contributions to society and I don't think men can carry a baby around for 9 months or breastfeed a child for 2 years. Men should be supporting women rights and the fact that men can't live independently on earth without women. The reason why some men say \"Women are so violent\" or other shit is because men are violent themselves.\nFoot note: I'm not grouping ALL men in the world when I mention the word man so please don't get offended~~",

Which are why most states are giving both parents equal time with the kids now unless you can prove there is a reason not too.   Not all women are out of screw you. My ex husband doesn't even pay child support. I waived my right to it, and the judge let me.  I ate most of the bills we had when we were married. The only one he got was his student loan which seemed fair as it wasn't mine.",

We&#39;ve voted less than 100 years, yet borne just as much of the workload as men have. We do get paid less for the same work on the average, and even if it stopped today, it&#39;d still piss me off just as much because it's happened this long. Yes, women and men are both objectified in the media and both expected to fill their<b>  gender</b> roles, or break thei<b> r gende</b>r roles in the \"appropriate\" way. And unfortunately the courts are extremely biased in favor of women in divorce cases. I have seen firsthand from my boyfriend and his daughter that sometimes the father needs to be the sole custodian or has a better relationship with the child.  But I do feel, for the most part, that women get the short end of the stick with issues regardi<b> ng sexi</b>sm.  We have the most expected out of us in the world and for the least possible incentive, in so many situations. We are thought of by many, even in the public eye, as sensitive, hormonal, bitchy, impulsive, ignorant second class citizens. See that comment Donald Trump made that <b> the wo</b>man speaking to him &quot;must have been on her period.&quot; Men have societal roles to fill, but I feel like the hurtful or aliena<b> ting se</b>xism falls mostly on women.

The chances of getting prostate cancer is 1 in 7 people. the chances of getting breast cancer is 1 in 8 but Also the statistics of men getting cancer in general is higher than women getting cancer but no, prostate cancer does not get the same attention as breast cancer cos its not a women issue.",

Nod to Martina to acknowledge her and her knowledge. They reply to Simon since in the South Korean culture he is her husband FIRST and her business partner SECOND. So they should always show respect to Simon and his wife by not showing Martina undo attention that may be deemed inappropriate. When they nod to acknowledge what Martina says and then they reply to Simon it is up to Simon to then ACKNOWLEDGE MARTINA for her input!!!! To show HIS APPRECIATION FOR HER KNOWLEDGE AND PARTNERSHIP!!!!  For the other business men to do so would be a sign of disrespect in some cases. Also in the Korean business world the same would happen if it was a business  <b> woman </b>you were speaking to and you both as a married couple. The husband is always given the most acknowledgement and again it is up to the HUSBAND to then give ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FOR HIS WIFE'S INPUT!!!! When Simon does not acknowledge you right away Martina they business people feel even more discomfort and feel he may be a over protective and jealous type and will not engage you in any further but turn to him even more. THEY ARE TRYING TO NOT CAUSE ANY OFFENSE!!! THAT WOULD BE DISASTER FOR BUSINESS!!! By the way I am half Korean and I was not raised in South Korea but in the United States but I still hold some of the values it seems that South Koreans have and people think I am odd.",

But i try to stay open minded. i just wish girls could be able to step out of what ppl expect and get into music like the one's blackpink had, 2ne1, or 4minute. ya know?

I was there for my internship with this guy from my class and our main (male) supervisor would look me in the eyes when I had some questions regarding my work for example. HOWEVER when the three of us were engaged in a casual conversation he RARELY paid attention to me or talked directly at me. This one time I literally leaned towards my male classmate hoping to get an eye contact.\n\nFunny thing is that my classmate rarely faced him while having a discussion because he usually had a project he was working on. So idk maybe my supervisor fancied talking to people's backs. What's even funnier is that I would get his attention only when my classmate wasn't responding but the instant he turned towards him, I was nonexistent again.",

And with acting I mean all this cutesy stuff and that she needs to be constantly protected by her strong man. In Myeongdong I saw a girl whining and being at the verge of crying... because of a bird, who landed about 2m away from her on the ground and she didn't stop whining until her boyfriend chased the poor bird away. I also saw lots of girls acting overly cute in front of the boys and it was so obvious that it was fake, I was wondering if the men even noticed... And I asked my male korean friend about that and he said, actually korean guys don't like it that much when a girl acts totally helpless and overly cute, because it's not her real self, indeed SHE ACTS. He said that many korean men generally like girls who are confident, but girls tend to think that men like that stuff. Could be because of korean dramas or music videos or girlgroups in general, I don't know...",

It's pretty easy for me to see when someone fakes something, that's why I don't like some idols' personalities...they act too much like \"I'm soooooo down to earth, look at me how normal I am\" and they exaggerate so much, but I feel like I'm the only one, who notices this (that's why I don't say which idols I mean to prevent myself from being hunted down by delusional fans).

I was by myself, hardly anyone in site near the Louvre and the movie Taken 1 kept running through my head. Sadly for women\u00a0we have to be more careful and\u00a0aware of our surroundings.",

            "commentText": "Geez the idea of being pulled into a club is terrifying. Its also important to note that almost all countries have degrees of <b> sexism </b>integrated into society. Including us \"Progressive States\" of Canada and the US. It may not always be as forward, but it can be subtle and pervasive. Especially when you broaden<b>  sexism</b> to include diverse genders and transphobia.\u00a0\n\nI find it funny that from everywhere, theres always men complaining about the women in their own country (as if they are all isolated), and that the womens groups there want \"more rights\". They want a full glass of water. Yours is full. The waiter filling their glass to match yours isn't \"more rights\" its just rights that you already have and haven't even noticed the luxury of, because you've never had to deal with not having them. Like you don't realize how good having electricity is until it goes out.\n\nI thought this video was good! It is interesting to notice how places like Korea and Japan can be so advanced in some ways, but still so traditional. I've heard some scary things about it, such as groping and being hauled into clubs, but then....I've heard scary things from nearby as well. Its easy to labe<b> l sexis</b>m a<b> nd misogy</b>ny to somewhere far away, without addressing the ingrained problems within your own home.",

            "commentText": "I know why dragging is ok and why business \"men\" only shake hands with Simon. (by the way, I'm completely against it. There's no way I would allow this happen to me.)\nAs they were saying in the video, girls are supposed to \"act\" submissive in Korea.  If not, they are considered as sluts... generally speaking. Therefore, in bars and clubs, girls don't really get out there and hunt(?) for guys even though they want to meet guys and hang with them. Bouncers know this - that's why they drag girls to clubs and have them sit with guys. Girls pretend they don't like it but they allow bouncers do this at the end and meet guys that way. This is so strange to me even though I was born and raised in Korea. Never really liked the nightlife there. \nAlso about handshaking, touching a girl's hand is kind of taboo-ish thing for a guy and visa versa, so maybe that's one of the reasons why they shake hands with Simon only. But still I'd be feeling totally discarded if that happened to me. \nSo <b> weird </b>how it's ok for a bouncer to grab a girl's hand and to drag her to a club but a businessman doesn't shake hands with a businesswoman. \nI will still love my country but... There are many things I don't agree in their society. No wonder I left.",

I mean there's still this thing in a few Chinese - Indonesian families where the children from the sons are called \"insider's\" grandchildren while the children from the daughters are called \"outsider's\" grandchildren and there are cases where the grandparents don't wanna accept them or a few families still prefer boys to girls. But aside from that, <b> sexism </b>isn't that much of a thing. Rapists are prosecuted and went to jail, women got equal chance for jobs and payment, and everyone can go to school.

Some places where couples or family with kids are crowded are safe but there ar<b> e craz</b>y people near bar or clubs.

I'll give you another opinion from a korean (AKA me, cough cough) First off, you know how our country company (mosty entertainment companies, apparently)are just filled with loads of shitty people who treats people like garbage and comes up with shitty excuses that are sometimes hard to believe. This doesn't mean I ever worked at a company and to begin with, I'm not at an eligible <b> age </b>to work so this just comes from my observation on news and personal experiences from people I know. Anyways getting back to the point, these shitty people just treats everybody bad alright? Alright. So it's part <b> \"sexism</b>\" fault and because of people who likes to \"discriminate\".\u00a0\n\nOn to about the women thingys. Sometime during the extremel<b> y ol</b>d days, China passed on this culture of where women couldn't do anything in front of men, such as eating, talking, and crap. This still exist to this very day of which now is a lot better but still bad. Oh and yes, before that whole entire China culture thingy came, women in Korea had more power than men, so fuk this thing. As for my personal experience, I am a korean girl who dress up like a male, gets confused as one and pretty much looks like one (just in case, no I'm not trans, the closest will be a cross dresser) and maybe it's because I look \"male\" I never had guys pick on me because they thought I was tough and whatever (which is true //cough cough).",

I guess they feel like they're the pretty bunch out of all the girls and what not. I guess the submissive nature of korean girls is how they're brought up, but on the not so illuminated side, most korean men are brought up to respect a<b>  woman</b> and not harass her and treat her like a servant. i see that from my parents where my dad is more dominant in the house hold (significantly) but he would not do anything that would harm her or go against her thoughts and beliefs. also my dad would do anything to protect her pride (because i gotta admit some people of my country are really sexist for no good reason, Douchebags i guess we could call them) The women of south korea are raised in that perspective, since ancient times we had a division of roles in a household and i think that's the biggest reason we are taught this way. me a bit differently though brought up in a foreign area.

In the US those men would be in trouble with the law, but it's not all that unlike women here being exploited or treated like a <b> sex </b>object, but instead of being insulted it boosts their self-esteem because they are taught that being seen as pretty and getting the attention of men is a personal achievement. I think some women might even find it scary and not like it at all, but will pretend they are okay with it so they will not be rejected. We're all taught that our value lies in our attractiveness and being able to get a man. It's messed up, but most of the world is still sexist, some cultures much worse than others. I don't like it, but I understand it. It still sounds horrifying! I would feel violated, and if anyone started dragging me somewhere, I'd immediately start panicking that I'm being taken somewhere to be brutally attacked. That's what would enter my mind, and that would traumatize the hell out of me.",

That shit is messed up!\u00a0\n<b> Indian </b>society (which is very very different in urban and rural areas. It also depends on the region of the country where you live) is not very receptive to women smoking. Outside my college in Mumbai there is a small cigarette vendor where students usually go to smoke. Since this is a post-graduate institute, all of my fellow students are legal adults in India and at least 21 years<b>  old</b>. The women who would come out and smoke with the men would be met with disapproving glares from passers-by. Girls who smoke may also sometimes be associated with other things that are considered \"immoral\" like drinking (kind of a taboo, especially for women), casual pre-marita<b> l se</b>x (again big no-no) and drugs. These women will be considered \"loose\" and may fall prey to victim-blaming in cases of something li<b> ke sexu</b>al assault.",

Last, the reception you get for speaking up will depend on how you deliver the message, not the message itself - had Simon pointed out to these companies that they were/are alienating and insulting foreign investors and consumers, Martina might have been shown a bit more respect.

I have had city bus drivers, creeps on the street that claim to be gents that I physically cannot fight off due to my genetic arthritis, friends, cabbies, you name it all try to get in my pants first and ask later ALL because I am a heavyset<b>  woman</b>!!! Also, guys here if they see a bigge<b> r woma</b>n on the streets struggling with her packages will NOT help her unless she says she loves them and/or lets him grope her like those are requirements to getting the assistance!!! I have also h<b> ad Afric</b>an (mostly West So<b> uth Afri</b>can, Ethiopian men or more N<b> orth Afr</b>ican men from Africa's northern parts of the mid-east) these were/are usually cabbies but also I have run into them on the streets, in shops, etc. say hi, I love you AND propose marriage ALL in 5 seconds of knowing me as a heavy set <b> white </b>woman is some sort of status symbol to them!!! The rare time a guy took me to dinner first (this was the ONLY time I had dinner prior!!!) he walked me to my apartment's front door I had NOT invited him up but the elevators on the outside show the floors the are going to/on for wait time and he had followed me up and it's a bit of a walk. As I was fumbling for my key I saw him (it's a fab so sometimes it takes a couple tries to lay it right) coming right for me and I tried to get in as fast as I could and shut the door before he could push in on me but I failed!!! He got on me like I was DESSERT!!! He started kissing all over me, stripping me etc. all he did was make out with me...even dragged me to the shower and made me shower with him!!! My apartment at that point ha<b> d lik</b>e zero furniture in it besides a bed and couch and my room had no lighting so there was no bedside lamp I could get to hit him with and I couldn't get to the kitchen drawers to get to my knives!!! I tried biting him turned out asshole liked it so that didn't help and I had clipped my nails earlier!!! I called him and told him since he had NOT asked me for it it was assault and his ass was headed to jail!!! Bastard told me to lighten up like it was some joke and I was making a big de<b> al over </b>NOTHING claiming if he had actually screwed me then he woulda asked but he just saw it without asking there was NO HARM IN THAT!!! Also, the cops<b>  here do</b> NOTHING and tell <b> you to d</b>o NOTHING but go to the courthouse as they make more money off parking violations as the traffic is such crap!!! I have ONLY<b>  ever s</b>een skinny chicks get respect from guys!!! You know why this bullshit is America's best/worst kept secret!?! As it happens around DC where it gets over shadowed day after day by the next amount of bullshit our government does!!! So our women that this happens to in this area NEVER get justice OR help and most clinics including ones I have turned to that claim they will help according to their websites claim t<b> hey will</b> do nothing including refuse to test you as if the results are used in court cases which such STD/HIV tests are they do NOT have the lawyers trained for the areas in which they claim to help people from so we could kill your case if called upon!!! So we are just left to rot and put up with it!!!",

That smoking thing you addressed is SO SPOT ON. Even my Korean parents who've pretty much become all Americanized still have that<b>  old</b> Korean mindset that girls shouldn't smoke, but it's okay for guys to. And that thing with Martina not being acknowledged is also very relevant because even in variety shows, girl guests are pretty much the \"accessory\" and aren't expected to talk much, but if they do and if their personality isn't sweet/cute or if they're a bit boisterous, netizens tend to be SO negative and harsh on them. I think that's because these shows have ingrained in people's minds that women should be demure and elegant at all times (giggling at all the men's jokes, covering their mouth when they laugh, keeping a straight back and legs together, pretending to \"blush\" to indicate their modesty, etc), although Lee Hyori from FO and Song Ji Hyo from RM don't get this hate because they've had time through many episodes to let the facets of their personality be gradually accepted by the public. But yeah anyway, I laughed at 4:15 \"I don't wanna do business with you....\" LOL. And the \"dropped her like a hot potato\" comment just killed meXD",

The fact that the <b> woman </b>is automatically forced into this role simply because she is female is wrong. \u00a0Imagine being forced into something like that with no choice what so ever... Just because you say it is easy does not answer the fact that it takes away choice. It also prevents many females from going to school and furthering their education.",

However, the whole \"grab the girl by the wrist and drag her away\" thing also REALLY annoys me in Korean dramas, thought I do understand it's somewhat of a cultural thing and I respect that there are differences, even if I don't agree with them. I really appreciate dramas where the female lead is strong and competent. One of the only ones I can think of right now though is \"My Girlfriend is a Nine-tailed Fox,\" and she's strong because she's a legendary creature. It's still funny though. \"I Hear Your Voice,\" \"Gu Family Book,\" and \"Secret Garden\" (and pretty much anything with Ha Ji Won, whom I ADORE as a strong female actress in Korea) also have some nice changes to the typical female-male power roles in Korea.",

Korea is not much of a touching culture in general and i think that a man shaking <b> a woma</b>n's hand or acknowledging t<b> he wom</b>an in a couple will be taken the wring way, like hes trying to accomplish something or be inappropriate. I know its not objective true, and all the rest of stuff is pretty darn bad, but in terms of touch and looking, that's kinda where I think it goes.",

Beeteedubshere beeeteedubs here, spoiler alert, spoiler alert (not that it matters though, since again, I'm way late) this is about secret garden...\nWhen at first shes all bad-ass and doesn't take shit I was like \"oh yes finally\" but then no. no. no. Sadly no. It especially made me mad when they had the <b> race </b>and they were all like \"Oh are you sure you can handle this?\" and shes like \"oh of course\" and my faith was then brought up again because surely this stunt women who's worked her whole life in working with daring stunts, who ran down a damn van across the city to then beat up guys would surely be able to kick these pampered little rich boys asses in a bike contest... riiiight? But alas, I was wrong. Not only does she fail, but then gets lost. Then after wards her character after the switch gets so insecure. Which in a way would make sense, but it should be like that for both of them right? No. No. No. Sadly, no. After the switch he just becomes better and somehow no one treats him like a women even though he should be one as far as the world knows. Now mind you, I haven't watched it all (again I am late to the game) I'm just around when the switch finally stops like episode 11 or so. I'm really hoping that it will be a change, but I doubt it. >U\n\nAlso poor Martina~ But also awesome SOOOOOZEEE~! I would love to see that happen in person lol.",

It makes me so mad! I was so hoping for something refreshing because the first episode makes her seem so strong. But the further it gets the weaker she gets. Especially during the switch. He was so strong and didn't care. He was easily able to cope with living poor yet she just lost her shit. I mean really the arrogant spoiled rich kid has to be poor for awhile and has no problem yet the poor strong girl gets to be rich for awhile yet can't handle it? ugh makes no sense. The only time she was strong during that time was when she got thrown in jail, but then right after the switch ended so I was like srsly wtf?!\nlol\u00a0sorry for my rant, but it srsly irks me and I haven't talked to anyone about it.",

            "commentText": "The reason for many Koreans' tendency to ignore Martina is probably because of her unusual and expressive hairstyle. Yes, her being female might also have something to do with it, but it's mostly because of her looks. You know how you often hear that Korea is very fashionable with modern sense of style? Bullshit. Sure, young Koreans like being \"fashionable\" but you're only fashionable as long as you conform to others' definition of fashionable. Uniqueness is thrown out the window, and although this may sound like a typical <b> racist </b>joke, EVERYONE. FUCKING. LOOKS. THE. SAME. Yes, this is coming from a Korean. Martina has a unique style that stands out and Koreans don't like that.",

If someone grabs your wrist, and you want to get away, turn your wrist towards the other person's thumb and index finger. Then yank/jerk your arm away from their body. Your wrist should slip out of the other person's grasp. since your wrist is at their thumb and index finger you can easily get away, because there is no way for them to maintain a hold on the wrist once it is jerked away.",

Because well, they are women. Also, we should wait around until men realise..\"its okay to shake a woman's hand and acknowledge her\". Compared to Afganisthan, even India is more tolerant. But that doesn't mean I shut up when some douche asks me at an interview \"why do you really study literature? to impress prospective grooms?\"",

So on that day 600ppl showed up when the studio only fit 200. As I understand the EXO fan group negotiated for 400 fans to enter the studio. So that could be a reason why people missed out - if you weren't part of the fan group you weren't allowed in. I've actually been to a M!Countdown all you need to do is turn up early.",

I think the way girls are expected to act are annoying and how some girls act themselves are annoying. This makes it hard for me to like girl groups and dramas.

It just destroys the drama for me, and I dislike the message it leaves; a girl that works hard and speaks her mind is not as loveable as a quiet and dull one.",

The Korean idea of Jaebol is real where a family own a company and is passed on through the family line, but the drama lines if fully exaggerated. Schools that train idols exist as hakwons (Private training instates) who \"say\" they train ppl. However idols are all products of major music corporations who train them into idol groups. Lastly, Yes we guys are more romantic towards girls imo. ^^",

Its scary because there is and there cant be any right or wrong we just believe that its the right one because we were rised to believe so... it scares me that we always talk about tolerance and acceptance but obviously we just accpt others if they are like we are. Why do some ppl love korea if they want their culture to be westernized ? Just sad",

Learning any language is always a challenge, but compared to learning say Chinese or Japanese, Korean is easier due to the fact they have an alphabet.

As far as I know (according to my studies) marihuana is not the worst drug out there and it has some medical properties. I assume the problem is not the drug itself, but the sin taxes (since the drug doesn't have any). What is your opinion on this issue? Greetings from Arizona :)",

I was studying in a Korean university and when we have group projects, they actually appoint a leader who will allocate work and do all the coordination. It was something new for me because in my country, students generally work together without a clear indication of a leader even though there may be a dorminate member.",

Of course you can't just watch one and say you know everything about Korea, especially since these are Their views and experiences.

With Simon and Martina being foreigners it's helpful to people who are thinking about wanting to go to Korea to have someone else's experience to go on.",

Also, they need to keep their 'image' clean and nice, as it's their job. In drama, you will always find one innocent girl but the others are not innocent. but I think Kor girls r more closed about sexualities.(s. intercourse)",

I am a <b> woman </b>and in my culture we don't shake hands with men but I understand that some people are offended by this so I usually bow a little and let someone know that I don't shake hands with anyone so it's not personal. If it is really going to offend someone anyway though, I will just shake their hand. It can be awkward for people who aren't used to shaking women's hands and haven't found themselves in the situation to know what to do ahead of time to avoid insulting someone",

Which is stupid, especially considering that she is supposed to eventually give in and realize that the assault is what she secretly wanted all along; she just needed a man to help her realize her feelings.",

I know that I would probably start swearing in swedish and look really pissed off. But I just got curious.... Especially to see their faces when they hear swedish from a korean-looking girl. Btw, Martina and Simon, you guys are awesome. Love your videos, here and the other channels! \nKeep it up!",

My family and I went to Korea, and we had dinner with one of my dad's friends..and during the whole dinner he would only talk to my older brother and my dad (maybe once or twice to me to ask what I like about kpop). But he did not say a single word to my mom. What she thought was the most uncomfortable for her was when my dad's friend wanted to ask my mom something, he would ask my brother instead of her (like \"What does your mom think?\" kind of thing)",

I suggest you find time to understand why Korean behave a certain way to understand the culture better to expand your perspective. Sometimes it's not about <b> sexism </b>or<b>  gender</b> inequality but more about respect in ways western culture do not understand. I am an Asian, I don't understand why some culture, western included, pay less salary to women!!",

The men were talking about whether or not they would want their girlfriends to smoke; they all strongly rejected the idea of having a girlfriend who smokes. Almost all added that they would not date a girl who smokes.",

Women do shake hands when they're closing business deals, however not as frequent as men. for example when I'm going out with my boyfriend they'll shake his hand but basically out of respect for me not mine. I would feel really awkward if a random man just wanted to shake my hand, it would be too \"touchy\" and would almost seem like harassment :/",

You say it's speechlessly offensive, and you're saying that about a person who believes that it's speechlessly rude to grab the hand of another mans wife. Just think on it for a bit. I'm referring to when they were on a TV show and the host reached past her to shake Simon's hand. It can apply to any situation. Both parties need to be tolerant, not just one party, and for the right reasons. Simon could take his hand and place it in hers.",

Like we're taught (by rape culture) that if we're \"too loose\" then we \"deserve\" <b> sexual </b>assault/harassment, so we're forced to take precautions--thus making us act or appear uncomfortable when a male is being physical (in ANY way, offensive or not) or \"overly friendly\". And it's sad that guys have to take these considerations because it's sad that women have been taught to feel so threatened.",

The focus is they want to be weak, not the men are sexist.",

The whole hand-shaking thing has to do with the Korean taboo against physical contact between members of the opposite<b>  sex</b>, especially between married men and women.  Yes, it's part and parcel of the overall sexist notion that married women are somehow the \"property\" of their husbands, but I think the handshaking quirk is a bit more innocuous than the other examples you cite.",

Asian media tends to depict Asian girls as being submissive and dimwitted and there hasn't been any major de jure or de facto action against those stereotypes. Of course, the question is are we forcing Western ideals upon Asia or is this a serious ethical problem?",

They do have really bad jokes tho so watch out for that but I have a Korean friend and he's really nice. :3 He even learned how to speak in Spanish because most of the community here is Hispanic~! :D So there are Koreans who are OK with every <b> race </b>and others that just need to talk to so they get to see you are not different ^^",

I've learnt better (if it's not obvious) but if you're worried about that as a reason not to go, I suggest rather it a reason to be going. They just need exposure to these viewpoints, which imo they lack.",

Anyways the story behind that is that if you were poor you worked outside with your hands or a factory, which they would get exposure to the sun and so forth.
