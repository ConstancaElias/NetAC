        "postText": "'The one-time presidential hopeful, revealed her clashes with the Russian President when she was Secretary of State as well as exactly what happened when she telephoned Donald Trump to congratulate him on his election win.', 'Speaking at the London\u2019s South Bank Centre,she said of Mr Putin: He doesn 't like women very much - or at least that's my impression.', 'From the way he behaves around women, the way he talks to women, he is dismissive and condescending.', 'The former First Lady, 69, made a series of revelations during a book tour promoting her memoirs titled What Happened.', 'Mrs Clinton also claimed the current US President Donald Trump, whom she ran againstfor the White House, wanted to be just like Mr Putin.', 'She said: Trump is still trying to please Putin. He likes that whole authoritarian thing - you know, the bare chest. I think that's his aspiration.', 'Speaking about her call to admit defeat in last November\u2019s presidential election, Mrs Clinton said: It was really terrible. It didn't last long, there wasn't much to say. He was surprised. He sounded stunned but incredibly ecstatic. You could tell he thought he'd never be receiving that call, and I never thought I'd be making it.', 'Speaking about Mr Trump on Sunday at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, Mrs Clinton admitted to TV presenter Mariella Frostrup she did not want to go to his inauguration speech and called it dark, divisive and dangerous.', 'She also referred to Mr Trump as Putin\u2019 s puppet and said the Russian leader had interfered in the US election.', 'Mrs Clinton said: Russia is a clear and present danger. The forces at work in the election last year are still with us. It was the perfect storm.', 'Mrs Clinton also commented on the allegations surrounding disgraced Hollywood movie producer Harvey Weinstein, saying it sent a strong message to men in power.', 'She said: I don't know if this is a turning point. Young women have to be given that confidence and support not to be intimidated.', 'She added: \u201cThe only way to get sexism out of politics is to get more women into politics.', 'Women are always judged more harshly than men.','However despite speaking out for women, Mrs Clinton was unwilling to comment when questioned on why she did not stand up for the women in the wake of her husband Bill\u2019s indiscretions in the 1990s.', 'Mrs Clinton commented: \u201cLet\u2019s leave it for history.\u201d', 'In an interview with CNN, Mrs Clinton issued a warning about Mr Putin, saying: Keep an eye on him, because he's not done. ', 'She cited the intelligence community's assessment in January that Putin directly ordered a Russian campaign to meddle in the 2016 presidential election to hurt Mrs Clinton and boost the Mr Trump campaign.','Mrs Clinton said: I think that Putin's campaign against us is much more about American democracy.','He wants an America that is divided from within.'",

The vast majority of us in the UK have no interest whatsoever in her opinions on any subject - all the more so as, like most Americans, she probably couldn't point to Dublin, Paris, Berlin, Rome or Madrid on a map. As earlier with Obama, we do not appreciate her sticking her nose into <b> Brexit </b>and we certainly don't want to read her self-justifying book. She lost - she should get lost.",

He's spoiled for choice on who to play the 3 parts from 'A' listers in Hollywood as most are shoe ins requiring no preparation for the roles. Not so easy for the role of Hillary as they had Streep penned for the hypocrite but even she's got off the fence and doesn't want to be associated with a bunch of<b>  sexual</b> predators. Finally, I believe they 're looking for Hustler owner Larry Flynt to be the Technical Advisor as like Weinstein, he's been in his own sordid business for a very long time.",
