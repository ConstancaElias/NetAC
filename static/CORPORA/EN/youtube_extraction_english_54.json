Not biased at all, haha.Those women talk about their feelings and bias but would never prove any unequal treatment  by numbers.\nNice propaganda.",

The general feeling is \"That girl is a badass\".    This is for the last 20 years.  Thus, I find it difficult to believe that competent, smart hardworking women who do the job well are at a disadvantage.  Do I believe that men flirt with them?  Absolutely, Humans want to reproduce.   The reason why There aren't as many women in STEM fields is because  most women are interested in other things.  Women's personalities are more oriented towards caring, nurturing, and helping humans.  STEM fields tend to be more bland and less human.   This is the difference between men and women, and it's ok.  If I worked in a traditionally female profession, I would probably be treated differently as well.",

What prevents these individuals to respond back directly to those that \"treat\" them as non-professional enough provided that the original \"mistreating individuals\" are rude ?\n\nHere's another interesting \"fact\" = the very same video that shows a growth of 5% up to 13% in 5 years period (so in a relative scale we're speaking of a 160% increase), also again = just reassures the negative \"perception\" that hiddenly lurks in the \"mysoginist\" individuals that women are never satisfied of any progress at all (on a personal, not business level), so there's another \"unwanted\" problem revealed to just literally don't give a f about lol\n\nThanks but no thanks, TRUE that we're 21st century and things should change/improve as time goes on but let time/study and life experiences change things rather than videos like this one though, the \"promotion of problems\" is just the literal reverse of what is needed to improve things, or in simpler words = examples and successful stories and personal progresses instead of \"talking the problem\", there's literally no need for promotion, just don't be an ass and that's quite literally not the first but all the steps needed to be done and frankly I doubt that that one hasn't been done IMO\n\nWomen can be asses too, so it's not like this is much genuine to the truth, and frankly = not like these can't be solved instead of talked about overall",

We should Just get rid of all those qualified<b>  engineers</b> that know what their doing because thei<b> r gende</b>r and skin colour makes you feel uncomfortable. Like I don't even know what you're asking for here? But it seems pretty sexist a<b> nd raci</b>st. Wow people ask you what you do?! The goddamn nerve of some people to ask another employee what they do in a company?! Her response \"Well clearly I'm an engineer! God! Did you think I wasn't one just because I'<b> m a wo</b>man?!\" and then the Guy says \"Uhhh.... No. I just wanted to know the details, I knew you were an engineer. For example I may be a software engineer but I work with a team of soft<b> ware engin</b>eers and we all handle different parts of the job.\" I really don't get this one either, as I just explained saying your an engineer really doesn't say that much and if you knew anything about engineering you'd know that. The lady with the glasses saying good for you your an engineer. I mean yeah if that actually happened like you described it then I can see how you'd be slightly annoyed at that. Although I doubt that happens frequently if it ever indeed happened. Additionally I kind of find it funny because as a man who is currently in university for engineering, whenever I let people know that I'm an engineering student they have literally the exact same response, but that response actually makes me feel good, that I'm smart and headed in a good direction in life. I know the circumstances are different but it's still interesting. Yeah their training and biases don't prepare them to encounter another human engineer, better send them off to gulag 13 for re-education eh? Wooooow you're coworkers try to make polite conversation and get to know you better?! Better stop this ra<b> mpant s</b>exism now before it gets even more out of control!! And yeah just a bit earlier she said it perfectly, it's these tiny microagressions, these things that only some insane person who tries to over analysis and misconstrue what people said to fit into their expectations. But moving on... It's really tough to explain to anyone why t<b> his is </b>racist or sexist because it really isn't so no matter how much bullshit I can spew out of my mouth any normal person would see this is not an actual issue. Yeah and if you fall outside the norms you probably get special treatment by the incredibly \"progressive\" tech companies who want to seem that th<b> eir not</b> racist or sexist so they will more often hire women and anyone other than white people to show off their virtuous progressiveness, I agree. WOOOOOW there ya go RIGHT THERE just proved exactly what I said before and I didn't even see this part until now! This to me seems to be the core message of the video, You should hire people based <b> on thei</b><b> r gende</b>r, sexual orient<b> ation</b>, and race. How very progressive. What ever happened to judging people not by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character? We just going to give up on that? Do two wrongs really make a right? No, they don't. Yeah just hire as many people who don't fit into the<b>  racial</b> and gender category of \"White Male\" because all of your products will be better and your workplace will run much more smoothly. What you're concerned it;s not fair to not hire someone because their white and male? You say they worked hard to earn their degree and get where they are and deserve to be afforded equal opportunity? Nah, fuck those guys am I right?! What?!!? We can't make apps for everyone in the world if \"everyone\" (meaning irrelevant catego<b> ries </b><b> such as</b><b>  race, </b>gender, sexual orientation, etc...) isn't in the room?! I don't understand... when did apps become a racial thing? I can see that maybe their are gendered apps like apps that are more likely <b> to be </b>used by a woman or man. But apps that are more likely to be used by certain races?<b>  Prett</b>y freaking weird dude. Yeah you need people from different backgrounds to get different ideas. This concept is constantly spouted out but holds no water, and i<b> s actua</b>lly pretty racist in my mind. It's like saying that all people of one category think the same way. To them we aren't individuals we are a collective it's pretty fucked. I do however understand how different backgrounds can actually help but only in very odd and specific situations where knowledge of a specific culture or tradition is important its hard to think of an engineering examples when this is important... Wow right at the end their is just<b>  great I w</b>ant more engineers to look like me... Why is that important really? Ar<b> e you r</b>eally such a racist that you can't work together with people of other races? Let people do what they want to do, let them live their lives as individuals with out being hindered by things they canno<b> t contr</b><b> ol li</b>ke t<b> heir ge</b>nder, race, and sexual orientation. That'd be great thanks.",

It is work, a proscribed environ in which one must be.

They're just the things that no one likes about working in an office. They should highlight better arguments than these if they want this problem to be taken seriously.",

            "commentText": "It's interesting that a lot of comments take offense to the presence of the video at all.  \n\nI am an employer, and I can relate to the stories that these women are telling.  It's a hard problem to solve, because the culture is self-perpetuating.  The people who work in these positions are overwhelmingly men, this has an impact on, before anything else, how interested girls are in pursuing these things even into high school when you're starting to build these foundational skills.  When you get past high school, where your classes are kind of balanced, you're just a bit different for being the girl who likes tech, you get to go to college where you go into your industry specific classes and find yourself to be one of the only 5 girls in your lab of 40 people, and you wonder why that is, and whether you fit in.  But then you power through despite that, and you start applying for jobs, and you get passed up for some and you aren't sure why, but you also don't have experience past your education so you play it off, but you start to have doubts about whether you belong.  And then you finally get into the job after all of that, and then you get exposed to the things that these women brought up, and you're used to that because the whole way along you've been having to prove yourself to yourself and everyone else. \n\nAs an employer, I have had women in IT roles who get second guessed and have people do end-runs around them to their managers or colleagues to get some kind of verification or validation because they're not willing to accept the judgment of these people for reasons that they try to justify based on things not related to these people's <b> gender.</b>  These things are generally unfounded and not really grounded in reality, but instead be questions about trust or competence that aren't backed up by any reason to doubt their trustworthiness or competence.  Managing under these circumstances is excessively frustrating because now I have to go and defend my staff's judgment or smooth things over, or even just tell the customer to get over it.  This is frustration that are not caused by the female staff member, but by the cultural expectation.\n\nI'm not willing to take it out on them, I don't give them more leverage than male staff, but at the same time, I am willing to advocate for them just the same, but more frequently. If it's a real concern then I take it to heart, but if it's a matter of trusting that they are competent without some evidence that they've acted anything other than competently, then those concerns aren't coming from a fair place, and I'll tell you that.\n\nBut I can believe that other managers, maybe in larger companies, aren't able to see things as directly, aren't willing to advocate for their staff the same way, and will hold it against the women themselves when people go over their heads to voice unfounded concerns based on their expectation of what a person in that position should look like.  I'd even admit that I might be affected by these things subconsciously, but I've worked with enough good women to try my best to consciously avoid those judgments. \n\nBut I think one of the trickiest things is that the environment makes it hard for women to take on tech roles, and then it makes it hard for them to keep tech roles, and it also makes it hard for people who want to hire women. The reality might be that given two people with equal skill, the man might be less trouble for an employee than the<b>  woman</b>, not because of anything that the man o<b> r woma</b>n do differently, but because of how other people perceive them.  In order to overcome this problem in the long term we need to be able to at least not favor the man over t<b> he wom</b>an because of that.  But even that's not enough, we need to find a way to encourage girls who are interested in tech to not be scared away because it's a boy's club, and we need to let them develop their skills without feeling out of place. And THEN we need to hire them, and advocate for them. \n\nI don't think we need a 50/50 split of women and men in tech, and it could be that fewer women are interested in tech than men, and that's OK.  I don't think we should be pushing women into doing a job they're not interested in to fill a quota.  However, I do feel that every girl that's interested in tech and every boy that's interested in tech should have the ability to develop their knowledge and skills in a safe environment, and have an even shot at a career in it. \n\nA lot will need to change before that is going to happen.  I know we still have growing to do just based on the number of people who object to this video being posted at all.",

Never something hugely overt, mind you... just little things. I've seen some really appalling stuff at conferences, though.  \n\nThe problem is one of chicken and egg: the way to solve people being surprised by a female engineer is to have more female<b>  engineers</b>, but that won't happen until the environment is more welcoming and inclusive. My employer has more femal<b> e engineer</b>s than most (and my experience to date has been that they tend to be better than their male counterparts... because the bullshit they put up with tends to act as a filter of sorts.) Still, though... lot of work to be done. \n\nIt's a long game.

That's basically like a Christian in America saying that they're being \"persecuted\" because someone laughed at them in the streets, while over in Godogodo an entire village of<b>  African</b> Christians were massacred by the Fulani herdsmen (look it up!). \nLook, there's some rea<b> l sexis</b>m in the world. In Bourgainville N<b> ew Guin</b>ea over 60% of adult men admitted to rapin<b> g a wo</b>man at least once in their lives. In Sub-Saharan Africa women are forced to have their genitals mutilated. In AIDS infected regions virgins are sought out and gang raped by HIV positive men because it's falsely believed the blood of a virgin will heal them. And in most of the Muslim world, women are treated as second-class citizens. \nThink about that, and then listen to these women whine about all their \"problems\" they have because they successfully made it into a respectable and high-paying industry! Just try to take them seriously as they decry their \"microaggressions\" in a land of prosperity while other people are dying across the world from the effects of <b> true miso</b>gyny.

Men btw will soon not be needed at all, because scientist are already trying to make artificial semen to make humans, so from the point of making more people women will be still more privileged AND OPPRESSED at the same time.

I mean, come on, you got your engineering degree and you work in a field that you like, why the fuck are you complaining over non-issues? \n\nI work as a medical technician with diploma in a field, where 90% of the workforce are women. And we're not talking a \"fancy\" field like an ER, OR, <b> mental </b>health institutions or first respondeds. No, I work in a retirement home and moonlight in a fucking pediatrician clinic, the most \"un-manly\" places a (m)nurse can work. AND I DON'T GIVE A FUCK about the opinion of the idiotic people who think that \"my job is not manly enough\". FUCK THEM! I like what I do, I help people and I don't give a flying fuck about the opinions.\n\nAnd, before you start in a condescending tone \"Well, you're not a minority, so you don't know how it feels like\", microagressions and all that bullcrap. I'm what's called a \"Chefur/\u010cefur\" , a mix between two Balkan nationalities who is not \"pureblooded\" or some bullshit. Yeah, boys an girls, we're getting in some serious Harry Potter \"muggle\" bullshit here. We are looked down upon, because our parents didn't choose the \"right\" partners with the \"right\" nationalities. Like the only reason that I'm worth less is that my father fucked a<b>  woman</b> form another country. Piss off.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that those women need some serious introspection. If you like the field you work in, then you prevail and succeed in it.\n\nAnd on the topic of \"wondering why they chose this field\" . Shit, people, if the workforce consists out of 12% of women, and in the years prior to 2013 was even less then that, then why the fuck are you wondering that people are surprised finding you work in this field. It is UNCOMMON, that's the ONLY reason why they are surprised over the fact that you have an extra hole between your legs that bleeds 7 days/ month. \n\nAnd to that Duretti Hirpa. Are you fucking serious? You feel uncomfortable because you work with white men? That's sexist AN<b> D racis</b>t in the parts where I come from. I work with a lot women from Serbia (for all those who don't know, there's a bias against people from other countries in the Balkans by IDIOTS, who are in a minority<b> ), docto</b>rs and nurses, why should I feel \"tethered\" by their lack of a dick between the legs and their origin? Simply, I'm not a fucking nationalists or sexist <_<\" .\n\nMy advice? Grow some pair of (lady) balls and enjoy the job/profession you worked so hard to achieve.",

What do you think I am? Religious xD?\n\nYes it's true boys will behave like boys because we shape them we educate them to be a certain way.\n\nYou haven't been paying attention to what I say, do you think that there is such a low amount of female<b>  engineers</b> and such a low amount of man doing housework just because it's about their abilities? Because it's absolutely not the way it is. Women are just as qualified as men when it comes to intellectual tasks.",

They can't fight, they're not fast enough and they 're not as strong. Ok, now we live in a time where those attributes are pretty much irrelevant but instead of us being able to see that rationally our instincts still hold that <b> age </b<b> >old</b> stigma.\n\nAlso, it's been a very short time since emancipation. Only in the last few years are we broadly celebrating female fighters, super heroes, businessmen, comedians etc. I think the main thing that stops us from being able to readily accept the value of femininity is when we don't see examples of females achieving status.\n\nI appreciate your point though. It is getting near the time when we don't need to be so patronising about 'equal' rights but I don't think we are quite at that point.",

You haven't done so by any objective basis as of yet. You're just spewing rhetoric and personal experiences. Historical discrimination does not affect the present in this situation. Women are generally less interested in certain STEM fields, that is a statistical fact. It is also a statistical fact that women gravitate towards positions which require fewer hours, less physical labor, etc. These facts may not be convenient to your narrative, but they stand just the same.\n\n\"And I'm talking about physical abilities because that was the excuse given to me (read my previous comment) when I was declined a hangar rec. They told me they would prefer men since \"a lot of climbing is involved\". I was talking about physical abilities because a previous comment told me men are biologically stronger, and while that may be true, it isn't always true.\"\n\nMen have superior muscular and epidermal structures compared to women. That's a biological fact. And once again, women tend to opt out of jobs which are physically or mentally strenuous. There is an extremely high turnover rate for women in hard labor, for example. Employers consider those facts when screening applicants for such jobs. An employee who may very well throw up their hands and walk off the job isn't worth the investment. That is where capitalism lacks \"ethics\"...\n\n\"Ramon Murray I am not all women, but women historically and currently experiece(d)<b>  sexism</b> in STEM fields.

You can speak at length about your own experiences. They're not verifiable or even reliable. They're tinged by your own biases. Your perspective always is. That's precisely why science is based on objective evidence. If you can't quantify something with measurements that others can interpret logically, it isn't scientific. If you can't replicate your results in a controlled environment, your results are anomalous. Bring forth tangible proof of your claims if you wish for them to be believed.",

It's a really interesting social phenomena attributed by the fact that men tend to choose to die through cars and guns which kills instantaneously while women tend to choose poison which takes longer to take effect giving friends and family more time to intervene and sometimes it doesn't work at all.  And let me guess, the <b> red<b>  </b</b>>pill didn't talk about that caveat, right?\n\nI learned about this in a psych class I took before the movie was released and became a talking point for anti-feminists like you. So just imagine all the other misleading things in the movie that's been twisted to criticize women and feminists. Hence why the movie is \"misogynistic\".\n\nAnd here we go again, blaming feminists for men's problems without direct connection other than \"ehh, its feminist's fault\". Did feminist promote social policies that lead to men dying in wars, and work? I could think of a few pretty good criticisms of early feminism but none of that were brought up by you or th<b> e r<b> e</b</b>>d pill.\n\nThe \"feminists don't care\" part makes sense if you only listen to what anti-feminists say what feminism is about. But the way you talk about is (with no exaggeration) \"well a group of mostly women who I criticize all the time are not paying attention to something I want to them to talk about therefore they're the cause of all of men's problems and they are a hate group\".",

One left to become an actress.  One left to become a project manager.  One just split and took a year long working holiday overseas and never returned to the field.  The manager herself had pushed her way into that pure management role to get out of software development.  In fact, before she was even a manager she used to act like one and look for ways to delegate her work to other people.  She was very creative when it came to avoiding work.  Eventually she bought a pub and left the field altogether to manage it full time.\n\nThe idea that this happens due to discrimination is an assumption.  The only people who were discriminated against in this scenario were the 92% of candidates who were rejected on the basis of their <b> gender.</b>  The others simply didn't want to be there.

There is literally 90% chance you're not.\n\nAlso you want more female<b>  engineers</b>? Good. Me too. Society too. Don't preach to men how they're not reacting well to you on the off chance you are an engineer. Preach to young girls how engineering is cool, because it is. Complaining about microaggressions is just silly. If you look different than most people there, it is only fair that they are curious about you. It's not a freeking aggression. It's childlike curiosity at worst, and likely just polite curiosity towards another colleague and human being.\n\nStop peddling how women are discriminated against. Stop saying how some minority has it tough in the West. We are as open and welcoming community as it gets on the face of this planet. Stop acting like there is systematic and profound injustice in our system. I'm really happy to say there is none. Is it perfect? No. But it is better than any society now or at any time in the past. Can it improve? Yes. Speaking honestly, thoughtfully and above all truthfully is the only way forward.\n\nConjuring enemies where there are none  is dishonest and doe<b> s nothin</b>g to improve anyone's life.",

            "commentText": "Yeah, not really sure how much of this is really \"rampant <b> sexism\"</b> or something else. Maybe, in some cases, you feel like you're getting hurt because you, yourself, go into situations with your own presumptions and fears that make you somewhat hypersensitive to \"microaggressions\" that that weren't meant in a negative way or even seen in a negative way by others who aren't paying especially close attention to these things?\nOr maybe, in some cases, it isn't really<b>  sexism</b> but rather you standing out in some way, being different in some way to those your peers have come accustomed to? You know, someone new who you don't know are trying to figure out? You probably do it too!\nLet's say you are in a group of America<b> n Engineer</b>s and suddenly there's someone who just migrated from a foreign country that, or at least you assume so, might have different customs and the person might have a different way of speaking, might not understand your humor due to not being immersed in the same culture as you, or there might even be a thick accent or other kinds of language barriers. This might make you act slightly different towards them as you're trying to get to know the person and figure them out. You do that with every new person you meet, but the more distant they are from your own social circles and group of colleagues they are, the more different you act towards them, especially in the beginning.\nMaybe you don't know if they understand your humor, so you hold back on it a little, making it slightly awkward. Maybe you are trying to be nice and you speak more slowly, more clearly so they can understand you, because you assume a foreigner might have issues understanding normal, every-day speech, which that particular person might and people assuming differently might annoy them or make them feel like you think they are stupid. Things like that.\nThis isn<b> 't raci</b>sm. This isn't even really you necessarily being a closed-minded asshole. This is pretty normal.\nThis can happen due<b>  to </b>age differences, too, or ANYTHING, really, that makes them stand out from those people you have come accustomed to. Just like it can happen <b> to a w</b>oman joining a group of men. Or a man joining a group of women.\nAnd with women nowadays, especially women who are seen in videos like these, it's made even more unnatural because it is this vicious cycle of presumptions from both sides, some wanting to please and forgo uncomfortable situations (and failing) and some being annoyed by all that and being especially offended or offensive, that just makes this worse than it has to be. And no one side is to blame for this, even though this video seems to assume so.\n\nAnd look at the statement at 2:58!\nIf I wanted to be petty, I could be offended by this too. This seems to me like she is assuming that men are sexist because they lack the sense of imagination to empathize with women and see how they feel, while she's ignoring that she might be doing the same thing,<b>  just g</b>ender-swapped.  If men can't possibly imagine what it's like t<b> o be a</b> woman, in any field, neither can women imagine what it's like to be a man. And believe me, it's not as easy for us as some of you seem to believe. \n\n\nThere was also the whole thing about a group of people asking \"What's in it for me? Why would I support this?\" as if that's in any way exclusive to \"men's clubs\". It is not. Not at all.\nIsn't that exactly what you are asking with this video? You, as a minority group, are asking for changes, asking to be treated differently, asking for the systems and norms to change to make you feel more comfortable. So you are asking \"what's in it for me and my group?\" whenever decisions are being made. This is what people and groups do. They act in their own interest.\nI doubt most of you would do your engineering work for no credit, no money, no other benefits, even if it helps some other person. Because when you do your work, when you put effort into something (and changing norms, like what's being asked here, does take effort), you want to be compensated in some way. Meaning, you are asking what's in it for you whenever you take on any kind of project. So why wouldn't others? Why is that suddenly a bad thing when that person isn't you?\n\nAnd then there is that whole nonsense about \"<b> withou</b<b> >t woman e</b>ngineers we wouldn't have a lot of things because women made things dude aw yeah women we are great!\".\nCongratulations? So have a lot of men? More men than women, most likely? With a lot discoveries and inventions of women done using methods, tools and previous discoveries and inventions that were likely made by men? So?\nWhy are you drawing special att<b> ention</b<b> > to woman</b> engineers doing their jobs well (that they got paid for) when previously in the same video someone's complaining about situations in which men are like \"WO<b> W! You</b>'re a woman AND an engineer!? AMAZING!\"\nThat is kind of what you are doing later in the <b> same video</b>.\n\nEngineers are useful to society, <b> regardl</b>ess of gender. Wow!\n\n\"I love my job, I love making stuff. I just want the industry to look more like me.\"\nThat sounds incredibly narcissistic, really. I mean, I get what she's saying and I don't even really have an issue with it, but if I were to turn this around, if a<b>  group of </b>male engineers enjoys being among their kind and someone who's very different, say, some women, then join that group and the group of men says they wish the field they worked in was more like them again, t<b> hat is </b>suddenly sexism. Women doing the same is normal and empowering and WHOOO we are great, worship us!\n\nSeriously, fuck right off with this.\nI don't care about statistics, about how many people of a certain group are in a certain field. Because there are just as many statistics that counter any argument made with that statistic.\nIf there's a place that GENUINELY discri<b> minates</b><b>  base</b>d on gender, race, whatever. Then that is a problem. And I mean really discriminates and not call you \"sweety\" once while asking you to pass the salt at a company dinner.\nIf a school or a culture REALLY discourages or even forbids people of certain groups to follow a certain career path that they want to do and could be great at, that is a problem and needs fixing. If someone, doing the same work, at the same quality and quantity, in the same place, gets paid l<b> ess on </b><b> the b</b>ase of gender, race, etc., that is also bullshit that people should fight against. That is worth our time and energy.\n\nBut all this pseudo shit, this microaggression nonsense and this \"muh statistics\" and \"oh no I am in a minority! Quick! Restrict people's freed<b> oms, di</b<b> >scri</b>minate by gender/race to fit quotas! Tell people what to do!!\" needs to stop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway. Good video. Almost perfect. 5/7!",

And variation for jobs where a particular <b> gender </b>has predisposition like jobs with highly physical task ( there isn't that much of these this days). I don't see what would be dramatic about that. Saying that it's \"dramatic\" is exactly the kind of words that can hurt that this video is talking about.\n\nI studied economics and sociology for a year in college before switching to computer science, basically, we teach boys to like blue and girls to like pink ( although studies shows no correlation between<b>  gender</b> and color preferences before children being exposed to that) we teach boys to dress like men, to act like men same goes for girls, we give girl toys to girls like dolls and construction kits to boys and we tell them to stick to the category they are in. and boys end up less likely to have a career where there is a lot of girls and the opposite for women... It's far more complicated in real life so many parameters but basically this is about right we shape our children a certain way and generally what they become is correlated to the way they are raised.\nSorry for the mistakes I'm French.\nI don't know for you but if one day I have a girl or a boy, I will never allow anything or anyone shape my child into a caricature of <b> a woma</b>n or of a man, I wan't my child to do whatever she or he want to do as long as it's a good thing.\n\nall this to say : there is a problem, let's do something about it",

I can tell you that it is just now becoming more friendly toward women, and that is a good thing.

See the thing is, that's not how the world works. You are not simply \"included\" into things because you have a page that says you're an engineer. <b> Engineers </b>work hard to get where they are, and having a cert is only a start.<b>  Engineers</b> don't feel safe in their industry. Job security and pay can be poor if you work from a startup. It sounds like you want to build robots that don't ask questions. If someone asks you what you're job is and you're an engineer that so happens to be female. That is not an insult, people will ask what you do. If they say congrats for getting in the field that is not an insult. They congratulate you because engineer is hard to get into, especially because engineering is a male dominated job. If someone asks about your background or ancestry, that is not an insult. They are simply curious because you are different to them.\n\nWomen have trouble with engineering because men work differently from them. When we ask a question we mean it, it doesn't have any hidden insult or is to mock anyone. If we are to mock someone you'll know about it. Men are simple creatures, we don't over think when people say something to us unless it has a sarcastic tone or similar<b> . Engineer</b>s, when told something they assume you are telling the truth and will weigh other better options in their head (That's wh<b> at enginee</b>rs do). I'm sick of women thinking they are the victim because we all have to put up with the struggle.\n\n\"No, motherfuck\" - Erlich bochman (silicon valley). \"Different ideas come together to create 1 product\". I see where t<b> his ch</b>ick is coming from but you can't make one product out of 5 different ideas of different things.

They  have higher chances of commiting suicide, mainly from<b>  mental</b> illnesses that are influenced by their stress.\nChoices of school based o<b> n gende</b>r stereotypes are terrible in general. Men are pressured to work a job earlier on than women, and are also sometimes pressured to be breadwinners(based <b> on gend</b>er stereotypes that men created themselves).\nHigher prison sentences for men equate to keeping them longer for prison labor, which they justify that men do more manual labor w<b> ith gen</b>der stereotypes....that were created by men a long time ago to suppress women from being independent workers....\nYou can't say companies prefer women over men. That's just too vague. It depends on industry, but even those stereotypes are just adjusted ones that men created long ago....to suppress women.\nYour last point is also created by men, it assumes female fragility(created and upheld by men) and upholds the stereotype through law, allowing for unfair judgments towards men is domestic cases.\n\nDo you see the pattern here? Most of these don't suggest that the male class is oppressed, rather, men as individuals can also suffer from the oppression of the male class. These certain stereotypes that men have created over centuries have now created problems for men today.\n\nFeminists seek to destroy the Patriarchical class which also forces men to be influenced onto a stereotype that naturally oppresses women(magnitude and explicitity vary) and if they do not follow it they come to the risk of being partially oppressed by the own class they were born into.\n\nMen don't have to use slurs that suggest discriminatory things. For example, women are weak minded(came from \"women are pussies\") is a popular one. Or \"man the fuck up\" next to it, suggesting that men are naturally stronger minded than women, which is not true what so ever. If anything, any man that gets defensive and starts throwing vulgar insults just from knowing someone might possibly be a feminist(you know who you are if any of you read this) are pretty weak minded, because they can't accept that their actions migh<b> t be misogy</b>nist and that they should be more respectful and considerate to those around them.",

Patriarchical class and economic class influences people, mainly men, to shut up about their feelings, which in turn can lead to many problems. Men as a result have a harder time expressing and empathizing with others because of bullshit stereotypes that seem to be \"muh biology\" and at it's worst it could lead to <b> mental </b>illness, which could be a reason of why men have higher rates of suicide\n\nWomen don't let their emotions take over what so ever. There's actually tendency for women to be more considerate and sympathetic to others because they have tendencies to know how to express emotion, which you think is whining, because you have a stereotypical prespective of holding back frustration because the large business owner class and the state wanting you to keep your mouth shut so you don't instigate riots and they lose their privilege and throne at the top of all this bullshit.\n Women have a reason to be angry. For centuries they've been coddled up by men and not allowed to flourish in many instances.\nIf you really feel like these things have to be just the way they are, then why don't you give women the opportunity to excel in these things if they wish, without being pushed back by male<b>  patriarchy</b> claiming they can't resist biological nature, when in fact, our entire society resists biological nature.\n\nRead my previous comment about how male oppression is a source of hypermasculine partriarchy and economic oppression from capitalism. Stop thinking that biology is the issue, that argument ignores and overlooks so much that it's not even viable for elementary school essay. Start focusing on sociology, economics, and politics in terms of class.\n\nThen you'll be a feminist, fighting for women to be socially, economically and politically equal(despite of biological differences that really don't fucking matter in 2017 because we're advanced enough to overcome biology, I mean, monogamy is a thing, if we followed biology we would all be in constant orgies because it's in muh nature lol) to men, and also destroying the ver<b> y gende</b>r stereotypes that everyone has to follow, so that men aren't also screwed over because of other men.\n\nAnd no, I wont let men just be \"themselves.\" Society influences them to be sexist and oppressive garbage, and I know that we have the potential to be respectful, compassionate and sympathetic people, and still be confident, assertive, and strong-willed.",

Who's the <b> snowflake </b>now?\n\nI mentioned how oppression is in different magntiude, form, explicity and variety. Feminism is popular around the world, media just blinds you to just see shitty white feminists. It doesn't just focus on first world problems. It's not about feelings, it's about true liberty and freedom from any source of oppression. \n\nYou don't have to feel like shit or feel bad. This is about justice, not just letting people trying to feel good.\n\nSorry(I really am) that you seem troubled by my words, but this is the truth. Many people have been analyzing society, and these conclusions have been made by continuous, deep think theory and understanding of all aspects of humanity, biological, sociological, psychological, economic, political, etc. All intertwined and influencing each other, creating a web of human interaction. And at the end of day, when all of this is done, when all movements against oppression are done, then you won't feel this way, you wont be bias to think otherwise. True liberty, equality, and solidarity.\n\nPeople do care, there are actions taken by the overall movement everyday by different people around the world.\n\nAll other arguments you had in your last comment can have the answers interpreted by my previous comments.\n\nGood day to you.",

I agree and further more can add that a number such as the ratio of men to women in engineering fields does not show there is a problem. Rather this demonstrates that despite a  level playing field women as a whole don't want to be or may dream about it but are not willing to put in the work as frequently as men are. I was listening to a consultant for law firms talk about female lawyers and the legal field has a hard time hanging on to female partners after 30 years <b> old.</b> This iss not based on their skills because they will have earned their place, but often women don't want 80 hour work weeks and put in the time required for that job and their priorities are not often the job first and that is what is required for the job, so they will often not take it in favor of family in what ever form that may be. The same applies with the top of most professions. They require a ton of work and sacrificing other aspects of life and most women don't find fulfillment in that.

You are searching for a sexist argument here when I'm not presenting one. The statistics clearly show a trend, and the very same thing you linked me previously presented the findings in a  similar fashion(page 8) that I did. I never shared my thoughts on why things are this way and why young women feel the way they do when considering the field of study, tackling it or abandoning it. I'm also not purporting that men have no part in trying to improve our societal shortcomings.\n\nAs you mentioned, household situations and the \"Second Shift\" is one of these problems that both males and females need to work on together as we are both at fault in keeping this antiquated way of living instead of adapting to the needs of the group. But, I agree, women feel the physical brunt of the load in the household for the most part, especially when children are involved.\n\nThere are a lot of things to consider for why some things are the way they are and if the way things are is a problem or hindrance to social evolution or if it's just a natural pecking order that is applicable to the general public.  Ultimately it boils down to my original point, this video addresses none of these issues, nor does it attempt to instruct us or fix the problem. It is plainly pointless poopoo.",

(also a century is arguably a very short amount of time compared the scope of human history, if we want to keep it about the bigger picture here) I'm also not claiming that things have not changed since Madam Curie's time, we have the right to vote and whatnot. But these are arguably superficial \"band aids\" of gashes that are more fundamental and are still with us, especially prescient in the large absence of women in STEM today. In essence, there is still more to be done. I'm also not claiming that they may not be \"externalizing internal fears and prejudices they feel should exist\" but instead of wholly dismissing the idea altogether as stupid, why not wonder why they may have these insecurities in the first place, though mistaken according to you? Is it entirely baseless considering the history of the fields in question? I think not. Discrimination of the sexes has been inextricably tied to the human condition thus far, and its very unlikely that we've been able to completely unroot millennia of social conditioning in the span of less than a hundred years.\nThis video illuminates these issues with the anecdotes of these women. And yes they are anecdotes, without much objective basis outside their own experience but can we not for once get our heads out of our asses to actually listen for once without being defensive and waiting for our turn to retort? \nAnyways, how can one reasonably expect for a five minute video to satisfactorily solve this problem? And just because it doesn't do this people have to abandon all attempts to bring awareness to these issues? The logic here is similar as \" we shouldn't have prototypes of cancer cures because if it doesn't cure the alignment once and for all then it's pointless.\"  Seems a little unreasonable, to say the least",

This campus is, surprisingly for a technical school, a very diverse and liberal campus. GCCIS, which is my college, has a Women in Computing club, to help women in the college find Co-ops and give them help for their classes in a safe environment. It also has the Society of Software <b> Engineers,</b> whose last president was a<b>  woman</b> and is now going to work for Microsoft. Things are changing, as others have pointed out, but there is also not a shift in acknowledging that things are getting better for women in the tech field. The mentality that I see is that things are just as bad as they used to be, which is totally not the case. You dismiss  getting the right to vote as an accomplishment(which it totally shouldn't have been, as women should've been able to vote in the first place), so what to you is  an accomplishment? Would it be when women equal men in all fields? In just the tech fields, like Software and Security?\n\nEdit: One thing I forgot to mention, my high school did girls only engineering courses, but they were still sexist. The things that they designed and thought up were completely different from what the actual engineering courses did. We made pens and a lathe, they made hairbrush handles.",

And while your anecdote is valid and should be taken into consideration, it's really just that- an anecdote, much like the accounts of these women; it's limited and biased and to expect anymore than this is unreasonable. moreover, while the tech industry is getting \"better\" from your point of view, things are not so a- okay as a whole. We'll still privy to all sorts of inequity, whether its based on <b> sex </b>or on class or on merit, what have you. These women's predicaments, whether reified or not (that interpretation can be different depending on the individual who may or may not sympathise with them), are symptoms of grander social ills, not the sole arbiters of them. In addition I never framed these in terms of \"accomplishments\" persay (accomplishment implies some kind of end goal and obviously progress does not pertain to a simple and dichotomous task- completion relationship, it's more of a continuum; in essence this label is too limited) but rather as small and necessary steps that attempt to unravel millennia of social programming, but certainly not sufficient in doing so holistically.\n\nalso about your high school. it seems more like it's the institution who is culpable of inculcating and reinforcing these prejudices, as is usually the case. of course people reinforce this as well but I assure you these high school girls didn't have some inherent inclination to make hair brushes rather than pens prior to being taught this. they are rather young, after all. Additionally, you frame it in a way that makes it seem as though making hair brushes was such a bad thing. both are utensils that are useful in their own ways and preferences between the two are pretty arbitrary.",

I was not saying that we say that \"Oh this is fine, ultimate equality has been achieved,\" but that things are getting better, and we need to see that. But the increasing thing that I am seeing, at Univeristy and in the circles that I m in which involve women, is that things are just as bad as ever. As I stated in another comment(which I presume you have not seen, just as a matter of that it's real far down) the tech industry, while it may not seem like it, is very<b>  old</b>. The prejudices that come from it being that<b>   ol</b>d exist, like the fact that women are not taken seriously, are dissuaded from going into these fields are all correct, but they are becoming less and less so. But the idea that we should let up is absurd, in fact, we should be louder than ever, because change is happening, and people are loud, but not with the right message. The message should be \"Oh wow! Things are getting better! Let's keep doing this and make things EVEN better!\" But that is not what people are saying. They keep saying that things are just as bad as they always were.

There's enough to go around, mind you. Now your individual perception of what these phenomenons mean as it relates to you and your individual life, which themselves are based on your limited perspective as the skin encapsulated ego that you are, is different.   the fact that these prejudices are happening to some lesser extent is not the issue, the issue is that it still exists and it is substantiated both by anecdote, history, and sheer statistics. \nFrankly, if you're a guy, as it seems to be the case, you will not understand the importance of keeping a wary eye of specious compromise because you have and will not experience these things in the way women do and thats a fact. It's not to give you guilt of being you or persecuting that, it's more a matter of helping you be aware of these things- the fact that we all have be to be more cognizant of the world around us and be accountable for the terrible consequences of our preconceptions. Just because you do not experience this, it does not mean it does not happen to a greater degree than the one you maintain.\n\nalso, my comment about your high school was also not about the perceptions of the girls themselves more as an explanation of why those girls percieve the way they do. again the institution, i.e the faculty, are most responsible for this.",

They're choosing careers they find to be satisfying to them and their need for work-life balance.  The fact that feminists are pushing for more women in roles that they don't want to be in shows that they don't give a shit about what individual women want.  What feminists are interested in is increasing the power that women have collectively.  They want them earning more money and occupying more leadership roles.  If that was really what women wanted to do they'd be making all the same sacrifices that men make to get into those roles.  They're not doing it because they don't want to, because women tend to have a more rounded view of what they want from a career than a purely financial or power grabbing view that men are much more likely to have.\n\nFeminism in the various forms it takes today, are collectivist ideologies.  They don't consider individuals at all, just the collective group... a fact that especially shows itself when you consider this issue.",

Most of it was over my head, so I stood around for a good hour and a half eavesdropping on or engaging in conversations. Males of Asian or Caucasian descent standing by their posters were most often asked about their work, and only their work. Anyone else got at least one question about their identities and backgrounds. It took me a while to notice, but once I did I couldn't stop noticing, if only out of the selfish desire for them to get on topic so I could figure out how they were identifying lipids. I could see the frustration on a couple faces that they were getting asked where they were from and how they got into college instead of how they accomplished the research they had spent months on.",

But one can be a feminist without being a misandrist, these are not intrinsically tied together as is always misconstrued (mainly attributable to stupid bitches who ruin it for people actually trying to find a resolution and not merely for some benefit* also these cases are waaaay blown out of proportion. You know how the media is always focusing on the worst shit possible because it is more inflammatory which equates to higher ratings, which in turn means more money? Yeah it's the same for this). Frankly there seems to be a lot of brouhaha over 3rd wave feminism and not enough of an understanding of what it even is, so I'll demystify it if you didn't already know: it is the \"response\" for the caveats of second wave feminism- in other words it attempts to offset what the previous generation didn't exactly address, i.e interesectionality, <b> race,</b> all that polemic stuff, via Hegelian dialectics. That's it. It's not a scary monster trying to take away your precious rights, in fact it's trying to supplement them by making extra room, not take away from the room that is already there. Most of the polemic here comes from lack of understanding; unlearned males who think that this will usurp them and reduce them to some lower status and unlearned females who think that this is an automatic pass to cause unnecessary harm in spite, both are stupid and unfounded.",
