        "postText": "A group of Australian university students who dressed up as the Ku Klux Klan and a \u2018cotton picking\u2019 slave for a \u2018politically incorrect\u2019 themed party are facing an investigation.', 'The men, from Charles Sturt University attended an end-of-semester party at the Black Swan Hotel.', 'Five of them were dressed up as members of the Ku Klux Klan, while one of the party was in blackface, carrying a bowl of cotton.', 'One of the photos, which have since been deleted, was captioned: \u2018Very very politically incorrect. Cotton prices are unreal though so it\u2019s a great time to be picking.\u2019', 'A group on social media was created to invite people to the two-day event.', 'It said: \u2018As exams have just commenced we are already looking forward to the end of term and thus, the idea of the muddy duck \u201ctwo dayer\u201d has been born.', '\u2018Thursday night [is a] \u2018politically incorrect\u2019 themed session kicking off at 7.30pm. So grab a kit that would legally get you in the shit and hook right in.\u2019', 'The students were slammed as racist after the photo was shared, with angry social media users sharing the students\u2019 personal information, reports MailOnline.', 'The student who posted the photo had his date of birth, address, driver\u2019s licence number, workplace, rugby club and university posted on Twitter.', '\u2018[He]thinks it\u2019s ok to be a racist prick\u2026 Feel free to contact his Employer, Uni and Club,\u2019 wrote the person who shared the information.', '\u2018Disgusting \u2013 how can anyone think this is okay?\u2019 asked another person.', 'In a now-deleted Facebook post, the Black Swan Hotel said it had no prior knowledge of the racist costumes.', '\u2018The pub was made aware of an incident unbeknownst to staff,\u2019 it said.', '\u2018We were unaware of this behaviour happening out the back of the pub, however we have immediately dealt with this. We have zero tolerance and do not condone this behaviour.\u2019",

It's like actors getting threats because their character has done something bad is a TV soap! This is a party, not a far-right rally. The ones in the kkk hoods are not actually members of the kkk.
