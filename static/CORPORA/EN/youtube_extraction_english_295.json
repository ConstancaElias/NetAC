I come from a travelling family myself, to understand the culture, the real culture. You never will. Non of you are open minded which is why true travelers stay private and away from house people \u2018gorgers'. It's trying to keep up <b> old </b>traditions. Which stems from respecting the life style your grandparents lived. I, myself and my siblings have been brought up in a house for many years now and have gone to school, college. And work. The<b>  old</b> traditions won't stay alive much longer because everything's moving up in life. However have you ever sat and thought to yourself that if we move into a house and live the life you will, you still won't accept us. It's taken many years for us to be accepted in our neighbor hoods. We had so many hate crimes happen, me a young 12 yea<b> r ol</b>d having drunk women try and attack me because I'm a \u2018smel<b> ly gyp</b>sy girl'. And you wonder why we want to fuck off and live our own peaceful lives. Because we don't get judged. We had to put up with so much. Just so my 11 y<b> ear </b>old sister and young cousins can live a peaceful life and go to school. I have to withhold the abuse so eventually you all give up and give the younger generations a chance. I'm 19 now. I smile and say hello to my now neighbours who used to hurl abuse to me, a young child at the ages of 15. Have you ever thought about the effects this had on me, wondering why I didn't want to go to school. I was riddled with anxiety and didn't want to leave my home. The bullying never stopped until I left high school and went to a college. I will say this, my family never once started trouble but we finished it and defended ourselves. My great grandad was a well respected  man, who didn't believe in thieving or lying. Strong catholics at that. And because you all seen something on tv you presumed we was like what you seen on tv. Now, imagine if this was any religion or other culture put through this. You'd stand up and defend them. But us gypsys get no one defending us all our lives we will have to defend ourselves.",

Irish travellers/Pikeys are a menace to communities, they expect the country to accommodate them but give <b> nothing </b>back. They came over from Ireland a several hundred years ago and have been here ever since. I'm still holding out hope that we can send them back.",

Theft is a massive problem when dealing with Pikeys. \nBecause they pay no rent, they often have quite abit of money despite their destitute circumstances. Irish Travellers tried to rob my grandfathers house, a couple days after he had sadly passed. They're opportunistic and I would discourage getting friendly with them, they'd rob you <b> blind </b>and skip town.",

But I've never had any kind contact with them and when I read all the comments about what happens when groups of Travellers come to town and I don't know what to think.  It seems to be a very interesting subject.  Can anyone recommend any accurate and balanced documentaries that I could watch to learn more?  I don't mean the \"reality TV\" kind.  I really would like to know more about these people, their history and lifestyle etc.",

Romani gypsies collapsed as a population because there culture was not sustainable in the long term. \n\n\nThe same applies to Irish travelers. Land is now owned privately and they simply are not buying land so it means they cannot sustain what they are doing. They cannot camp on a public road and the fields are not available to them. \n\n\nThe reason they are in the UK in large numbers is due to the fact their simply is not enough land for them in Ireland.",

She took her 2 year<b>  old</b> and just bolted.She ended up working as a waiter in London in the 1990's, where she meet her second husband. He's Australian and he made an absolute fuckton in the early 2000's tech boom. This was after my friends mum had married him and moved with her daughter to Australia. So anyway my friend grew up here and never knew her mums family or anything, but eventually her family found out about them. And let me tell you, travellers might talk a big game kicking people out and only marrying within their group, but the minute they found out what my friends step-father was worth (like I dunno defiantly tens of millions) they disregarded the whole thing. They where obsessed with moving here and becoming \"Part of the family\".",

If only they could reduce their negative contributions to the community as in didn't steal, beg for money, rub, throw garbage, spit, piss and shit, and/or possibly have somehow positive impact to the society as a whole, such as not rubbing, stealing, throwing garbage and shitting outside, and maybe paying tax (direct/indirect) I'd have sympathy for them, as now how is stands, sheer sight of them is a menace and direct reduction of property value. Anywhere they are, in Ireland, Italy, Norway, Canada or France. Sad to say, These people are B A D news.",

Most romanies value cleanliness, are often shocked by the\u00a0filthy habits of the settled community. Many non-travellers do fly-tipping, including on sites just vacated by travellers. Most non-romanies are stereotyping racists. \u00a0Massive numbers of romanies, including little children,\u00a0were killed in concentration camps by the vicious non-romany butchers supported by millions of their <b> racist </b>ilk; the Porajmos-holocaust that is rarely mentioned. No doubt millions of racists would want the same extermination today; that shows the character of\u00a0huge numbers of non-romanies;\u00a0fascist thugs like those the world war 2 \"finest hour\" heroes fought against. Romanies and travellers are persecuted and treated disgracefully, as ever- kind, responsible\u00a0and decent ones attacked, spat on, insulted. \u00a0The land should belong to us all, instead of millions of acres belonging to the criminal rich, the rest with nowhere to stay. \u00a0The<b>  racism</b> of the settled community has caused the problems they now complain about- it could all have been very different, but hatred breeds contempt in return. Shame on all racists and hourray for all those decent people who simply want to live a peaceful nomadic lifestyle but are subjected to so much disgusting harassment and vitriol from hateful and narrow-minded hypocrites",

            "commentText": "I've always tought my sons to treat people how they want to be treated. Last night I was walking with two of my sons to fetch a 3rd from cubs, on the way two 'travellers' tried to humiliate me by calling into question whether or not I was the owner of two functioning testicles. To be honest, I was confused at first, as I presummed by their voices that they were suffering some speech, and or, <b> mental </b>malady. They took my apparent confusion as a win, and sauntered off to intimidate the staff at the local shop.\nMy kids were full of questions! Suffice to say I simply told them that travellers are a proud and noble<b>  race</b> who felt so threatened by our walking past them, that they had to strike first. I then reiterated that diversity is our strength, and that our ancestors probably enslaved their ancestors, so really, it's all we deserve.\nMy kids asked why I didn't stick up for myself, a difficult one that, I just went with the truth, and said, \"The noble travellers love to fight people, any people, as its part of their rich and diverse culture. However, if I defended myself verbally, then they would see that as a green light from me that I wanted to partake in a fight. Then, if the one I started to fight with looked to be in any way losing, his companion would then feel compelled to join in, to guarantee my defeat. He may also call his nearby relatives, and they would also feel that it would be in everyone's best interest for them to ensure that I spent the next few days in hospital\".\nSo suffice to say, I'm sure there are some travellers who are great, unfortunately I've yet to meet one, or indeed, anyone who has had a positive experience with one. This programme virtually celebrates their existence, each syllable dripping with patronising admiration.",

When I encountered them in Staines back in the mid eighties they told me \" we do what we want, we swear in your restaurant when there are kids around if we want and fuck you\"   This was after I had politely asked them to stop swearing in front of families on a Saturday afternoon. One bloke got very angry with me basically telling me he would do exactly what he wanted. They had loads of money but hated the local population and wanted to fight at every opportunity!!!\n\n\nNow maybe there are some nice Pikeys out there but sadly they will be painted as scum because of the others!!",

They came 3 years later after he passed and sealed my Moms driveway, and did a shit job. And for some reason its really slippery when its raining. So this year i told her dont answer the door My brother put a AR 15 sticker on  her door.  We are in America, we have guns. So they dont mess around here because you never know who has a gun. Lol! Most of us do. So that protects us from a lot of b.s. If someone comes onto your property uninvited, you can point you gun at them and order them off. If you feel afraid you can shoot in certain counties.  Its call the Stand Your Ground Law. Guns are useful because you dont't really have to use them to protect yourself or your property. Just the threat is enough. People take advantage when there are no real consequences.",

We had a broken fence at the end of the path between the field and our house. They fixed it overnight, we didn't even ask. They then came to apologise, and told us that they'd just been evicted, had only a few people (there were about 4 or 5 caravans) and they needed somewhere to go until they found a place more permanent (in their terms, a week or 2). We told them they could stay for up to a week, as long as they took all litter and didn't leave any trace of being here and didn't try to do anything dodgy. They left after a week and the place was spotless. Rare, but cool",

I didnt have to deal with them until it was time to kick them out.....OH MAN. There was shit and trash on the floor everywhere. Literal shit. Found out when I came in one day, that my manager was going to call the cops and kick them out because of the headaches they were giving the rest of the staff and the fact that they were behind on paying their bill. How in the FUCK could you be in a hotel room and have feces on the floor?!?!? The bathroom is right there! The public bathroom was literally 15-20 steps away from the room too. They ended up getting kicked out a few days later. Ever since, I have heard <b> nothing </b>but bad things about these folks which is sad. I hate to judge a whole based on the parts, no matter how many shit parts there are, but damn man.",

            "commentText": "I understand that travellers do sometimes cause problems such as dumping waste and trespassing on private land when stationed illegally, however there is a wider issue that concerns me. During world war 2 the Nazis killed millions in the death camps, but what we seem to forget is that a significant proportion of them were gypsies. The ideology that the Nazis embellished, that they were in some way superior to travellers, amongst other groups, seems to still exist today, even in a reduced form. At the end of the day travellers are no different from any other person, and should not be marginalised for their way of life, as that is not our place to judge. As I said, a minority may cause some trouble, but what we seem to forget is that many of the non-traveller community are very difficult in their behaviour towards the wider public also. Although many of us may have formed opinions, some with basis, some without, it is important to remember that travellers are humans of the same importance as the rest of us and that their culture should be respected and treated with as much dignity as any other. Not all people are the same, we should not generalise a specific culture on our opinions or isolated events as this breeds unnecessary hatred.",

They live by a park and on a main road in a mini cul de sac,I've seen first hand they're dogs being run over while chasing someone across the road who was simply walking on the wrong side of the path and the dog trying to bite them. Kids get barred from shops and harrass ppl shopping and working all the time. One day I saw one jump up on the counter of a pizza place for a laugh screaming racial remarks. Another time the retail shop I worked in had to be evacuated and staff sent home after there was (with no exaggeration) an all out brawl between two families because someone was wearing the wrong colour,too many of them not enough security and they just had to be left at it . Then at any given time of year at least one of the 8 houses are totally burnt down, constantly being repaired by the council and tax payers and another burns down in a <b> weird </b>cycle. Most are lovely in my experience,but everyone just avoids them with well founded reasons. Respect and manners cost nothing",

As with any demographic there's a few troublesome folks but most of them are just trying to live like everyone else. Many travellers even want to buy land and settle permanently, however local councils refuse to sell them land and grant planning permission simply because they don't want travellers living in their district. This was the case for several families I knew growing up, they were forced to continue moving around because<b>  nobody</b> would let them buy somewhere to live. Institutionalise<b> d racis</b>m only makes this situation worse, it's unreal how many people are prejudiced against gypsies in the UK despite never actually meeting them. They have a noble bloodline that goes back thousands of years and their culture is as welcome here as anyone else's; it's called Great Britain not because it's full of angry white people, but because throughout history we have been invaded and settled by bloodlines from all over Europe and even further afar, making us the most mixed and unique Europeans. Everything about British culture celebrates centuries of immigrants building this gre<b> at nati</b>on, we wouldn't exist without them.",

How they stole this of mine, that of someone elses, how the foul mouthed kids do whatever they want and at the end of the day these people just up and leave their filthy garbage behind to be tidy'd up by the local community.\nThis doesn't exist here in Australia, they would last about one day before locals would band together and beat the shit out of them, make them clean and take their mess and let them well and truly know to Fuck off and never come back. No talking to them and trying to get them to leave nicely. They'd just plainly get the shit kicked out of them. It works. \nWhy is the UK so stupid and soft on this Behaviour?  They only do it because you have a system that allows them to get away with it. Band together. Stop being such a bunch of weedy dweebs and defend your people and areas.",

But the ones who aren't are the travellers you see feeding the homeless, going to holy countrys, trying to educate children is a way there not dissing there culture but still leaning ( I'm 15 I get home schooled 1 a week) most girls in my area do aswell. I dont live in a trailer my dad owns a travler sight it's so safe people walk there dogs and bring them here so the kids who are playing outside can play with them. \nOne thing about my culture is my family dont think getting married at 16 is right my full family dont . My dad bought me a car and said ino your not<b>  old</b> enough to drive it but live your life like your sister who got married at 19 . 19 seems young to non travlers but to us that's a bonus . We don't arrange marriages becuse love is love. One thing country people need to experience is bieng on a green field in the summer all the dogs a loose and you and all your friends theres 15 of us walking to the shop. \n\n\nAll I have to say is theres more to my culture:)\nGod bless all of you prejudice people\n I wrote this fast so If its messy sorry",

Even the council had one of their vans broken into in broad daylight, and all of the garden tools stolen whist the worker was unlocking the pavilion on the very park they had occupied...\nAt the same time, by coincidence, my mate's garage business was broken into by two gypsies using a pair of hydraulic jaws  to cut through the steel doors..By coincidence, earlier in the week a fire engine had, had it's hydraulic jaws of life stolen whilst attending a car crash on the M1....I wonder if anybody died because of these thieving scum?",

They camp wherever they like with impunity, in fact in places they are encouraged by councils to  set up camp. They are all over the place and if you are unfortunate enough to get caught in conversation they will regale you with stories of their free camping experience and bore you to death.\nWhy are these <b> old </b>farts allowed to do the same as the gypsies yet gypsies are hounded wherever they go?\nMy mother would never pass by a<b>  gypsy</b> without crossing their palm with silver",

It's no wonder communities turn militant when no matter where they go they are discriminated against and judged to be all the same. Any minority throughout history has had to endure untold amounts of suffering until society finally accepted them. It's easy to pretend like certain people don't belong and are <b> alien </b>to society because it makes you feel better about yourself but your identity and your way of life is just as subjective and fragile as anyone else's, including travelers. You could lose your home tomorrow, you could be thrown on the streets, lose your job, be patronised by your peers and excluded from your community. Who says you should be treated like that? If that's true why should anyone else? You get the bad people wherever you go and whoever those people are. Doesn't mean everybody is the same. My ex girlfriend was a settled Irish<b>  traveller</b> and she was the nices<b> t woma</b>n I had met. She's married now. Her dad has worked all his life. Her mum too. Her family are very well connected. But if you think they've had that life given to them on a plate think again. She used to tell me how people would throw them out of pubs for belonging to the Iri<b> sh travell</b>er community, without doing anything wrong! She would get dirty looks walking down the street and got bullied at school for being different. She chose to stick with education and came out with a degree despite most women in the community feeling pressured to follow the traditional path. She never said boo to a goose and her family never caused any trouble. Not to say an extended members didn't but you find me an extended family that is squeaky clean and model citizens. It's all relative and your stats are bullshit. Provide evidence or fuck off.",

They have no fixed abode so they can't really be charged with anything and they know it. They filled up at petrol stations, drove off, walked into shops..took what they liked. Property was smashed, kids ran wild on bikes throwing stuff, locals attacked by loose dogs. We've had armed units down here. Burglaries were happening everywhere, lead from roof tops stolen and cars disappeared off the face of the earth. Everywhere by us had to close down. The police can only watch them.\nPlease understand I'm sure there are some good family's out there but I haven't experienced that yet. I'm now someone that doesn't want them by me either.",

Time to have them prosecuted for shoplifting when it occurs instead of police turning a <b> blind </b>eye as I've just witnessed in a TV documentary! ..  and time for the police to stop pussyfooting around. Time for them to be forced to pay for cleaning up the rubbish they leave behind when they vacate a site. Time for them to realise that they can't simply set up camp wherever they want to. Time for them to research where the official sites for them are located ...

They can be real dicks if they want to be but can also be quite nice, especially when you beat them up. Get into a fair fight with one of them, beat him him, and if they don't get their family to beat you up you'll have a best friend for life - they really respect people who can fight. \n\nDon't trust them with anything tho, as loyal as they are, their loyalty is only reserved for their families.

They sometimes block useable space, then sometimes cause problems for those who pay taxes locally. Then when they move, they often leave all their waste, making a neighbourhood look worse than when they arrived. Surely, it cannot be a surprise that there will be resentment when they make visible changes to a neighbourhood in a matter of hours. I think, if it was done by going to a campsite and using bins and not blocking people from using public spaces, they would quickly rid themselves of this horrible stereotype.",

Householders vehicles need to be registered now, locally to use them. I agree with you there wholeheartedly, waste costs more now to dispose of than ever, and the places to get rid of it are getting less to, government will no longer willingly grant land and permits for landfill either. I too have always said that if the disposal situation was easier, more would use them. If it goes down a lane or into a field, nine times out of ten, the local authority ends up not only with it, but has to send men out to fetch it in. And the costs triple. Thorny issue today, waste disposal everywhere. And it's due mostly to cost.",

They used to provide a service of being tinkers and doing other odd jobs, and to some extent some still do but the vast majority have turned to behaviors that have them hated by settled people. Such as, leaving their haulting sites destroyed, feuding between their own families like bronze <b> age </b>savages, stealing and swindling, mistreating their \"pets\", generally being disrespectful of others and not teaching their children how to be respectful. It's sad that all travelers have to deal with being tarnished with the same brush by settled people but when such a large proportion of travelers are bad human beings it's only wise to act in such a way towards them. What travelers need to do is settle on their own get a stable job, buy or build their own home, not among their extended family and slowly built a good reputation among their settled neighbors and in only a generation or two would be seen as trusted individuals. It might be hard leaving a tradition that's been around for hundreds of years but all that remains of that tradition in the future is misery and poverty.",

A campsite i legally went to the other weekend the gates were broken down and the camp was invaded by a huge group of gypsies over night none of them paid anything then got into a fight and vandalised the toilet block.\n\nSo before you go around calling people excplicit names\n\nLook your self in the mirror you \"self absorbed rotten cunt\"",

My plan now is to pay off some dept, buy either a motor home or caravan and do it all again. If you taste the nomadic life and its for you then living in a house is just awful. I get it. but travelling by yourself is easy compared to family's sticking together in convoy. I know of a dozen places on my doorstep where I could pull up for a few nights with no hassle.

            "commentText": "Well the fundamental problem with what they're doing is that if the entire population did it, society as we know it would break down and collapse e.g. the healthcare system/social and public services etc. If everyone decided they were going to live in a caravan and not pay taxes, the country wouldn't function. If you allow some to come over then just as with economic migration, it only encourages more. \n\nThen there's the reality that space is extremely limited o this small island as it is. Then there's the fact that they create a mess everywhere they go. Then there's the fact that they intimidate the locals. Another issue that arises is similar to the problem many Western countries have with their Muslim populations and it's integration. The travelling community refuse to integrate into mainstream society. They basically want to live in their own parallel society and at the cost of the tax payer. This isn't good for society as a whole.\n\nI could go on and on but these are side points really. Ultimately, a <b> nation </b>can only support a small number of  them.",

A reference to public parks from the House of Commons, Communities and Local Government Committee states \"Our public parks and open spaces play a major part in helping to shape our\ncities, improve the quality of life and play a central role in making our cities\ngreat places. In our often very heavily developed and crowded cities, the\nparks and open spaces provide clean fresh air in which to play sport, get fit,\nmeet with friends, attend memorable events and they also provide a place to\nappreciate local heritage, engage with nature and relax.\"\nI, in part,  agree with your statement that a local authority could own the land and that the parks are run, or funded, from public taxation schemes.  I would ask the 'travelers' what taxes, that you allude to, do they pay to contribute to up keep of the public parks that they have driven across and occupied before being evicted from these public places?\nAlso with a 'traveler encampment' established how are other members of the public to exercise their ability to ...play sport, get fit, meet with friends, with a number of caravans and road traffic crossing the park?\nAlso who is charged with the clearing of the debris that is left as the travelers leave?  Is the travelers? The local authority via taxation schemes?",

In one weekend, I  had five incidents of groups of them exiting the cab with no intention of paying, and four did notes being handed over as payment. Virtually every single cab of a fleet of 250 cabs & over 200 private hire vehicles in our town had at least one experience of their anti-social behaviour. The shops and houses around where they parked up were subject to break-Is & theft. The Police were overloaded with reports of crimes committed by the travellers, so the cab trade had to accept being well down the list of priorities. The pubs & clubs endured a whole weekend of vandalism, theft & counterfeit  Tenners and twenties being passed. Any establishment where the doorstaff refused them enry were met with violence & vandalism, or threats of both.. It's  no wonder these reprobate are not welcome wherever they go. The also drove expensive vehicles all over the sports pitches, completely ruining newly laid grass, and trashed the facilities for the pitches. It cost thousands to repair the damage and clean up the  revolting stuff they left behind, once they decided to leave for pastures new. This is all documented fact, not rumour, so, snowflakes & PC do-gooders, don't bother pulling out the <b> racism </b>card, get off your lazy arses & follow some of these groups to witness the reality of their rail of destruction and criminal behaviour before you start calling the local population \"bigots\" and \"racists\", and sympathise with the travellers/gypsies or whatever they call themselves. That one weekend  cost me virtually a whole week's earnings. Yes, I actually worked for an honest living, but I still had all my expenses like insurance, licence fees etc to cover and repairs to the vehicle after one group tore the rear door off in their attempt to make their trip free of charge!",

Now that the entirety of Nations have laid claim and possession to nearly all unclaimed lands , there's nowhere for the Scamps to be without leaving the 1 st World for the 3rd World ( and for your info the vast majority of the 3 rd World don't have gas pumps  as well , most are deserts ).",

The police don't do anything even though these people are trespassing for days before they get moved on. if I went and parked my car on my local park I would be asked to move on by the police, yet they wouldn't do the same for travellers. Why should they have special rules? I can't trespass and neither can they, that's the simple bit that isn't hard to understand. I would never rule out a whole group of people saying there is no good in them at all, I'm sure there are people  in the <b> traveller </b>community with good hearts. You have to understand though this is a real problem where I live. The clear up operations can cost \u00a330-\u00a350k depending on how long they stay (funded by mine and your council tax). I mean even if they cleared up after them then that would be a start, but the ones that have moved in to parks and football clubs by me never do. In the case of the football club they had to foot the bill and struggled to stay open, not sure how you can really defend that?  I really don't think it's a simple as you make out 'treat them like neighbours' not sure if you're experienced with travellers but that doesn't work. They are breaking the law from the offset which is what often causes the confrontation, whether that's with the police or the locals. Good look with your approach though, maybe it will work for you.",

So now on first glimpse of any travellers arriving the locals are in uproar. I now understand the hostility towards them as now we don't want any because of this. Hopefully one day a family may come and prove us wrong but my nearby neighbours would rather not take that risk with them now.",

They are a plague round here and always leave rubbish. They're abusive as well and try and stpo people from walking through their camps. They even take over school playing fields. They don't pay taxes and they prey on homeless and vulnerable people (I should know, they tried to kidnap me when I was homeless)",

Talking to an adult traveler is honestly like talking to a three year <b> old </b>child, there is no excuse for this anymore, you can pass a university degree these days from home. I reckon if there was some way to get these daft w@nkers up to speed with education that would be the end of the travelers, they would disappear for good, it's their stupidity that keeps their culture alive.",

I dont like animal fights but i have made money from it because when i pull up in new cars people respect that.  And i dont want to sound bad so i explaine about the stealing . Example i want a 100inch tv . I cab either buy it for a few k or i can buy a stolen one for cheap or take it off the person who stole it . Few punches usually does it . Then i have the tv and the money . Sister wanted a watch so i could buy one or take one off someone for free and i get a new watch for <b> nothing </b>. Sister happy and person who i took ot from gets insurance and has a story to tell the other slaves at work . Maybe she will.go.do karate and meet new friends . I want some fuel . I can buy it or slice someones pipe open and take it . I get free fuel they get a day off work and insurance and a story to tell his slave friends from the office . I get excited i can buy a<b>  woman</b> for 60 for one hour and do what i want . Go home and kiss my wife . But i dont just steal cheap things for no reason . I see scum bags stealing food and hugcaps and things and i wonder were society is heading . I have over 700 horses . What am i supposed to do ? Do you have any idea how much they cost to shelter.  But they have to eat no . So i out them in outher peoples fields . I keep the best new ones and sell the worse ones for meat in France.  I dont like doing it but it buys me big houses and i have a huge family . Each wedding costs me over 50k . Then they need things and i provide very well . You likely think i am wrong but i was born in a field in a storm and never had a house . I have a army behind me but i dont go hurting people . Iv built what i got fro<b> m nothin</b>g . I never went to lean i taught myself to read and write the 3rd time i was in prison and i know i dont do it very well but its helped make me millions with property in over 18 countries.  I oay tax in petrol and diesel and between us we do over 10 million miles a year so when fuel s 85% tax they do very well indeed . I have paid for the roads english people drive on . A small thank you now and again wouldnt go a miss",

I can take a <b> race </b>horse and it will go faster than one you can buy . But i wouldnt steal a chocolate bar and throw it away for fun . Are you telling me you never stole anything? What if you want a big television for example . What are you going to go and buy one . Or a new fancy car.  I have luxury cars that cost over 50k plus . Lol are you telling me you would buy them . What about fuel dont try and tell me you pay for that",

Long long story later i paid em over 3 times that back and sorted many people out . I wasnt given it i took it.  I cant go into detail but i never was given anything . I managed to hit over 70 mil on paper and sold up . In reality it was less than 40 and then had legal cases ect . I ended up with around 5 mil and a large house and few property's separately.  You have the wrong stick let alone the wrong end of it . But at 20 you can do many things as im sure you know . For what its worth if i were 20 id be investing my time into building a recycling company .  I could invest if you have passion .

I used to work for a drain maintenance company and my boss got a contract to clean out the drains in 22 of my counties<b>  traveller</b> sites. You know what? All the sites we worked on except 3 were kind people who offered us a cuppa and actually helped us find our way around the sites and had a laugh with us. The other 3 sites we had kids trying to steal shit from the lorries and tools we were using and wanting to fight us (im 6'2\", weigh 115kg and have been doing karate, muay thai, jui jitsu, wing chun and taekwondo for the past 20 years lol) and a 11 yea<b> r ol</b>d <b> 5' nothi</b>ng 100lb when wet little shit kept trying to spar with me! In the end we couldnt complete those 3 jobs coz they were too annoying so we left before things got ugly. The moral of the story? Yes some of them are cunts, but the majority were actually alright, which as is the way with any group of people, is usually the case. Obviously i wouldnt trust any of them, but then again i dont trust anybody anyway until its proven to me that they can be. If you think they're a problem thats fine man, you're entitled to your opinion, but venting your frustrations on an 11 y<b> ear </b>old girl is a bit out of or<b> der, trave</b>ller or not. In your defence though, if they wanted less hate, they really should clear up all their shit when they move on and less people would be pissed off at them and might not even mind them stopping temporarily in a field near them, as long as the burglary rate didnt go up too.",

It's bizarre that it's illegal to essentially wander the countryside and camp where you want. It's a shame they completely destroy any area they pitch up in, and usually fill it with rubbish. Perhaps the only option these days is probably to buy land and stay there legally, like a few groups did near me? I would give a better answer, but it's very early \ud83d\ude02",

Or, I go home.\n\nMy family does not come with me.  My wife and kids stay in the house that I bought, maintain, and on which I pay taxes.  I want them to feel safe and secure where they sleep.  That feeling is best achieved by ownership.\n\nThe most fundamental aspect to the European/North American tradition/lifestyle is property.  The idea of selling one's time to buy something that will last, to which one might return to rest.  \n\nImagine working for 25 years to pay off something that has a value of \u00a3300 000.  That's a lot for anybody.  Anything that brings down the value of something that has already cost that much will not be viewed favourably.\n\nThere are truck stops where I live.  No problem.  It's expected, planned for, and, being private property, anybody there can be legally removed by the owner of that property in an hour or less.\n\nSame goes for campsites.  They are also private property.  People pay to park their caravans there and leave when their time is up.  No problem.\n\nWe thrive on things being predictable, orderly, and our property rights, which do not infringe on the property rights of anybody else, being respected.  I can tell anybody on my property to leave, and as the owner, I expect my will to be enforced promptly.  It really is the most sacred natural right we have - people's homes are their castles.  \n\nAnd how much does anybody own anything if trespassers, of any group, cannot be removed from it promptly?  What if non-Travellers thought that your legitimate campsite looked good and decided to move in uninvited?  I would expect your unit to react with similar hostility, and I would not blame them.",
