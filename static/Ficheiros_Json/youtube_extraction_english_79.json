But no she didn’t lose weight all naturally, otherwise her face wouldn’t be so chubby. She definitely got injections for under chin and neck fat removal , fillers obviously even on her jaw. Good job indeed but don’t tell me for a sec this is just gym and kitchen tactics. It’s not. I train since I was 11 and this body isn’t all natural. They all manage to have similar body types without having identical structures few years ago- even their friends - cause they do similar surgeries.",

I'm a big fan and have watched you from the 1st episode of KUWTK, and see how dedicated and hardworking you are. You've achieved so much, and adversity doesn't stop you from being your best self. I have a very personal story and would like to share it with you. How do I apply as a contestant for revenge body?\nYou will definitely want me to join, as my story speaks volumes as to the superficial and shallowness in today's society. If you read this, please contact me at vicjo7k@gmail.com! Would love a chance to change myself 1st, and then help others to change as well.\nThanks for your consideration!\nLove to you and your beautiful True!💕😘🌹💪✌🤞👏🙏👍👍",

Alex is the one, why her middle name Alexandra??? Explain that. Kris know Khloe isn't his, she stay quiet because she's too white, taller, dirty blonde and her nose got big, when she got older, took nose surgery, I felt bad Khloe doesn't want to know DNA, she ripped off document, Kris seem relieve not want her to know, keep last name, Khloe prefer  Kardashian but that's BS, Khloe Alexandra Roldan period! If she wasn't cheat, would have Robert Jr then meet Bruce Jenner, Kris would have five not six. I guarantee, Khloe is not HIS, she's NOT Kardashian. I bet two ssters knew but ignore...but Robert Sr wrote his own secret journal book, his 2nd wife has it. He told his 2nd wife the truth before he died.",

The interesting thing to me is that Courtney is the oldest sibling and she looks the best out of all of them. She's had more kids than any of them naturally did either. So that just shows that plastic surgery isn't always the best decision. Imagine what Kim is going to look like when she's 50 years old. She better get that stuff taken out of her ass because it's just going to continue to look worse.",

Everything about her is different. Her hair color, her eye color, her body and even her skin color. She's clearly not Armenian. You can see that her sisters look like the Father Robert Kardashian. Khloe looks nothing like him. I think it's funny that they try to make us believe that she's related. Really, they don't have to tell us anything they don't want to but since they put their lives out there in almost every way including trying to say that Chloe is Robert's child then they should understand why people are going to question that. Kris Kardashian had affairs in the past when she was married to Robert Kardashian so why is it such a far stretch that she might have gotten Knocked Up by somebody else? I'm actually surprised that she doesn't look more African-American. They all seem to like to date them. Even the mom has followed suit.",

Sure lady you use their makeup and wear their clothes and you will look like a sister. People quit making them bigger millionaires!! Keep you money and make yourself feel nice or get rich keeping all that money you spend. Sorry but I honestly think their bodies look like freaks. God that ass was not meant to be on a woman. Somebody pulling the wool over their eyes telling them that it is the ultimate body part. Too too too took toooooo much body in one area. And I read that someone was asking anyone a question about the whole family dating African Americans except Kourtney. I don't look down on them for that and I'm not racist but it just seems like everyone was afraid to bring it out in the open for some reason. Out of a Mom, 5 daughters and a son, all but everyone except Courtney and Kendall.",

Khloe may have lighter skin and hair, but her facial features are quite similar to Rob's and they are not that different from Kourtney's either. \nKim however looks nothing like kourtney, khloe or rob in my opinion. Maybe she's the one who's not a kardashian? But no one seems to think that for some weird reason. Lol.\n\nIt is also important to remember that siblings can look very different. I know plenty of siblings who share both parents and they look nothing alike. I also know plenty oh half siblings which infact do look extremely similar, so being different doesn't mean they are not related.",

When all of them got famous because Kim's mom leaked a porn video of her daughter getting rammed by the black anaconda thru the back door. I as a family member would have hidden My face in shame, rather they capitalized on the event. I actually don't understand the fame of these people or who actually watches and follows them.

How many people have certain  distinctive features that she doesn't  at all and she doesn't look like Kris either so you can't say well she looks like Kris Because even that's obvious she looks nothing like Kris because  Kim Is the one who  looks like Kris and  Khloe neither Like her mom or her suppose it dad Robert Kardashian looks nothing like her However  Kourtney does resemble Kim And that's due to their Armenian features.  FACTS   1 + 1 =2 ...  An apple is a fruit ...   Donkey Kong is a video game ...  Starbucks sells coffee  ... Khloe is biracial !!!",

Just by looking at the many, many, many, many (I think you get my point) photos taken of Kholé  through the years it’s pretty obvious that Kholé is even lighter skinned than the two known children Oj and Nicole (RIP) had together during their tumultuous marriage. If Oj is to have fathered Kholé then she’d have the very dark hair like her sisters and a darker skin tone but she does not. Kholé is a beautiful woman and now a new mother to her precious baby girl True Thompson, congratulations! It’s a time of celebration for her, and for all new mothers, and for the joy that a child brings into a family or to create a family. Perhaps with this baby excitement, joy and happiness it’s time to shut down gossip, rumors and mindless speculation and innuendo regarding paternity of anybody, and not the least of which Kholé ‘s...their is nothing sinister nor salacious about it...it’s simply none of our business!   ☘️",

The color of her skin doesn't have to be dark to prove that she's from OJ. Bone structure and features tell a lot of stories. I like the love in your comment, but just sayin\".",

I'm 6 feet and my husband is 5'10 he has no problem with my height he chased me for months before we dated and got married. Jordan sparks (a celebrity) is also 6 feet tall she's fucking gorgeous and Taylor Swift is 5'11 there is nothing wrong with being tall.",

My point is not that Jordan is a \" SHRIMP\" In your own words. I was not speaking of Jordan or yourself .  My opinion In this is the perception  I see that her family the woman are all shorter than she is what are the chances?  Her skin color, hair color, and eye color are different.  Yes I find it strange. A stranger thing is that she is taller than her brother.  And you, you answered...reminds me of the sayin, if the shoe  fits then wear it.    LOL YOU  SILLY!!  I  do believe that I directed my question at KLOHE  not you? And yes it is extremely  difficult  to  understand, the fact that, these men, the  basketball players  are exaggeratedly tall. They almost appear unreal. So to see a woman kiss this athlete with such ease... My point is I DON'T believe  all that I hear!!! If you are 6 feet tall, well  so you say. And as far as how tall  KLOHE   is.  So you say. IT'S NOT A FACT. how do you know? Are you her best friend? She  must of done a lot for you.",

Again my comment was not directed at you.  This brings me to my next point.  Society at best has to depend on others  to exist.  Eat food to feel energy,  water to stay hydrated, sleep to not be tired, watch television shows to not be bored, work to have money, gasoline to fill thank for transportation etc. The list goes on. Now you are saying other must say certain words to make you feel good? That is ridiculously shameful...lol Where does the freedom of speech go? The sence of expression . You see I am not   responsible  for  your self esteem! That sounds twisted to me. You see I know who I am what I stand for, what I like, what I DON'T so all other opinions about me Will slide off.  Others DON'T influence my core believes and furthermore\nDepending on others to make me happy!  If  what they say about me makes me sad or mad that sounds like it would be a personal issue.  If that happened I would have to see a shrink.  The whole Klohe Kardashian  thing is this.  They are  public figures.   They base their existence on others.   There for my point is valid.   Bottom line you or other should not depend on me to feel better or worse. That is my humble opinion it might not be humble yet it is mine.  BTW That word you chose to use \"Shaming\" It sounds like you got that from the media, tv, internet media, magazines. I  will no longer respond to your comments.",

According to you,  and your most dearest friends the Kardashians I am just  jealous.  And in my head I have a question. Of what is there to be jealous  of?  I will say that it would be rather ridiculous to be jealous of a MAN POSING AS A WOMAN.   WHEN I MY SELF IS A WOMAN A REAL ONE NONETHELESS!!!  Jealousy  is not part of my repertoire... I often wonder.    This comment was not directed towards you.  Why,  then  do you bring it upon yourself to answer...  Be familiar with the famous saying \"IF THE SHOE FITS THEN WEAR IT\"  ( laughing quietly to myself)... I will tell you what it means... so you yourself  must be a man POSING as a woman.  Why else  would my comment offend you at such extend,   so  that you would call me  a jealous cunt??? I don't even know what the word CUNT  MEANS. I  do imagine what it means not sure thou... Ya so you CHEAP TONGUED.  person.   Have some pride in your self and maybe a  little bit  of self worth... You sound like the tipical CORNER WHORE.  ( Laughing quietly to my self).

(Rob K. did not cheat on Kris btw, but he simply refused intimacy when something was bothering him, I find that to be perfectly normal) stress will take the mood right out of you, and that doesn't give ya excuse to cheat!! I completely get that!  What a good man he was, beside being a sole provider for his big growing family but how big was his heart for accepting Khloe as his own, even though he knew deep down she wasn't!",

The other 2 look alike. Also these pix are proof that Khloe, like Kim had butt done. Kim was sooo pretty when all natural.. she literally look like real life Pocahontas. I would love to see what she looked like today without all the surgeries. I bet she would be prettier. Khloe took the butt size too far... looks all wrong and obvious not natural. Too bad. Kylies only one that looks good after all her work. As long as she stops now and doesn't have anymore done... maybe watching what her sisters done will show her not to make same mistake.",

Khloes face but in older male form. He's a big guy too which is why she's a big girl..well was but much taller and build totally different than other 2 girls.

But the picture of her real dad tells the truth. Absolutely no denying that. When Kris wrote book about all the affairs which I never read only heard about... Kourtney was mad a Kris and didn't want anything to do with her for a while. She said she didn't know how she could do the things she done and more.. surprisingly on the show. Hell on one of the episodes she met up with a guy she had affair with while with Bruce then told him later about it. That family has soo many secrets and skelaton in their closets.",
