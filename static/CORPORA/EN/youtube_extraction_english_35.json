            "commentText": "In most civilization's since the beginning of recorded history, approximately fifty percent of the population where reduced to a second class citizenship. Though a few achieved positions of prominence, for most of history they where denied any significant influence in the financial or political spheres. Yet towards the end of the nineteenth century and continuing till the present, this segment of society has made greater strides towards being fully represented in areas of influence. The movement for equality of women was just one example of movements of people working together to end injustices. And for the most part it seems to have been a success, governments and other influential entities have many women among their ranks.\t Yet in the media was well as popular culture, a sizable amount of the imagery of women presented is somewhat derogatory in nature. So while women have won equality in life, many of them are somewhat dehumanized in media a public perception. What am I talking about?\n\tFirst of this an example is a very <b> old </b>double standard. A man who has bedded a significant number women is seen in a very positive light among his male peers, a<b>  woman</b> who does this will be seen as single word descriptions as slut or whore. Suc<b> h woma</b>n's entirety is seen as something which is primarily about matters of intimacy, that one characteristic of behavior making other more subtle characteristics a moot subject. The media unintentionally glorifies women <b> as s</b>ex objects, yet in real life such a disposition will be seen by most as something to be looked down upon. In media dramas where show women in the workplace, though women are usually portrayed in a positive light they still seem to be shown having relations with one or more co-workers; that even if they have professionalism they still are partly driven by being with men. The media has also created a stylized yet empty image<b>  of wo</b>man's beauty, women grapple with feelings of poor body image and th<b> at a w</b>oman's highest worth in society is as a attractive object. T<b> hough </b>woman have achieved many victories, their public image still seems to lag behind significantly.\n\tBut changing this is not the job of men of men who might share such a view, much self respect and dignity is gained from a group overturning the injustices which confronts them.",

For example, in the beginning, only rich men could vote and then, every man who is the head of the family and then, every man and then, every person. This wasn't <b> gender </b>discrimination but financial. And before advanced technology, most jobs were physically strenuous and as a result, most women didn't work. It was not until WWII when women were forced to work due to the shortage of men.",

This dude not so long ago would not leave me alone, i kept telling him to leave me alone and he eventually called me an ungrateful bitch for not wanting his attention, I later noticed him attempting to follow me home so I got a cab. That was in broad daylight, and it was intimidating. Its a minority, but a lot of women dont want to take that chance. Im not trying to get sympathy but you can surely understand why women become intimidated by these advances right? Yes its definitely less intimidating in a public place in daylight but you surely get my initial point. The guys in this video see it as a joke/dont care because the <b> woman </b>clearly isnt going to (or is very unlikely to) do anything threatening, it would be different if a built man was doing the same thing to women.",

Try dealing with this 3 times a day while on your way to work, running errands, or trying to relax with a beer at your local bar. It's physically and emotionally draining.\n\nI noticed only one of the men reacted the way a <b> woman </b>would. That was the second, slightly older bartender. Why? He deals with harassment every day. Men and women who say and do inappropriate things due to<b>  alcohol</b> consumption. Bartenders see some messed up people and actually have to talk to them. Kudos to all of them! \n\nSo guys, before you judge the women who are commenting on this video, spend at least a year bartending and experience harassment on a daily basis. Then I'll respect your opinion. Until then: shut up!",

It's just there, it's not someone joking around, it's just normal behaviour.\n\nBut when I look at it from this perspective it seems so obvious and from their reactions ... they just find it unbelievable, like it's some sort of skit. I suppose the purpose of this video was to highlight that disparity - that a certain type of man practices this sort of behaviour and women have it happen to them so frequently that they would feel silly complaining about it or it doesn't seem worth it. Nonetheless it always leaves a sour taste in the back of my mouth when it happens.",

NO SHIT they are calm or nonchalant either because they obviously realize that this <b> woman </b>is not a threat, she couldn't over power them if she tried OR they never had to even deal with this kind of situation.\u00a0\nWhen I'm approached by grown men who I don't know and they tell me he wants to fuck me I DO act just as calm as any of these men but you assholes don't know what it's like knowing that rape is an every day reality for women living in the most developed to under developed cities.\n\nMaybe if they were consistently sexualized every other day for years maybe they would care, don't you think? If it got to the point they felt unsafe, they felt harassed, felt uncomfortable in their own skin because their own fucking skin was a threat to their safety... is that what it takes to care!?\nI've had men yell out perversions out at me since I was about 11, so maybe they need to grow up with the fear and insecurity... would they care then!?",

This video isn't here to say that all men are sexists and do this, but i really think that every <b> woman </b>has experienced this kind of encounters at least once in her life. Women, never said all men did this, so you really need to measure your words. Just because YOU don't do this doesn't mean it's not happening, and trust me, it happens everyday. I gotta say that i'm french, so it may not be the case everywhere.. But in France it is. For all the comments like \"you should take example from the calm guys\" etc, don't you think women ignore them too? She's not that rude, because when a man \"refuses\", she's juste like \"ok\" or \"are you sure?\". The \"worst\" thing she said was \"are you<b>  ga<b> y</b</b>>?\". Most of the time, when women ignore this kind of guys or even say \"no\" with a smile, their reactions are more like \"nevermind, you're really ugly anyway\" or \" actually i wasn't interested in you, you'<b> re f</b>at, horrible...\" etc etc. And we don't answer to that neither. I would have LOVED to see men's reactions if she did this. One day, i was going out with friends, and a guy stopped me in the streets. He was like \"hey, wanna have a drink?\" then \"Please gimme your number!\" (in a insistent way), and i said something like: \"i'm sorry, we have to meet friends in a bar\" with a smile, and said no for the number. I didn't insult him or anything, and he just said: \"Nevermind, i'll find other bitches tonight\". So nice, isn't it? And it was not the first and the last time it happened. So we're not saying that all men do this, but trust me it happens everyday and this is not really nice to be insulted freely.",

I'd smile and say no thanks, but to them a smile means yes. So I stopped smiling and just said no thanks, but I said thanks so that means yes. So I said no, but I talked so that means yes (they'd write down their phone number after I said I don't want it and shove it in my vest pocket). One guy grabbed me and kissed me when I was collecting carts outside. Eventually I had to activate The Bitch Face. It's when I completely ignore them and I look like I'm angry all the time. When they say \"hey miss\" even if they're innocent men needing actual help, I keep walking or I walk away and I get another staff to help him. I really, really hate doing it, but I feel like I have no other alternative. It's the only way they leave me alone.

Doesn't that in itself tell us something? That women in public are subject to fear when harassed and men are not. They do not see it as a threat because there is no overhanging 'well you kn ow that I am stronger than you, so you better not get too angry/ loud/ whatever, because I can just slap you down.\u00a0\n\nFrom my own life - I am a larger than average <b> woman,</b> taller, and strongly built. I was rarely harassed by men smaller than myself, though I am bigger than a lot of men. I think that this was because I COULD represent a physical threat to a short, slightly built man, and they would rather not risk it! The last time I had obscene abuse hurled at me (ironically about 5 minutes from where the video was filmed) the man was at least 6'2\". There has got to be some feeling of 'safety' being that size. He certainly felt unaccountable for his behaviour.",

So was their goal to make men understand what it is like to be objectified or to make women feel empowered by the role reversal, it's the former right? They have shown how absurd such behaviour is, but as for men feeling objectified there is no evidence to suggest men were negatively affected by it.\n\nIt would have been far more powerful if as soon as the video ended they replayed the exact same scenes again but as it in real life with men behaving badly. That would have hit home. They could have even done it with men hitting on straight men, just to make it even more awkward.",

I partially disagree, but even so, it really doesn't take much to kill a man. get a knife or a blunt object and just go to town when he isnt looking. During the scene with her just staring, what was actually going thru my head was, \"wow isn't he scared this <b> crazy </b<b> >woman</b> might try to stab him or something?\" because to me that was jus<b> t weir</b>d...and i know the only people that try and do that for as long as she did have something wrong with them, that seems like a real<b> ly wei</b>rd street harassment case.

Well i said what i wanted to say to you on a different comment, but I'll add another thing. You should not think of yourself as an all-knowing god. You can and will be wrong about certain things in your lifetime. What I think you fail to do is actually what you call other people out on. You don't seem to address the issues or points they bring up, instead you just be rude then go on to state some other point that doesn't address much of anything. Try and stay in the scope of the initial argument/conversation even when other people don't. If you wanna be a true feminist champion, you got A LOT of learning to do. Most importantly, relax. you're digging an early grave if you stress out too much.",

After having read this comment thread and the argument you had with Gondar, I have come to the conclusion that you are a stupid <b> b*tch </b>(and before you call ad hominem, that is not an ad hominem. You're a stupid<b>  b*tch</b> AND you're wrong, you're not wrong because you're a stupi<b> d b*tc</b>h). Feminism is a movement for social equality, yes, but this ideology you're trying to defend is not feminism. It's so<b> me cra</b>zy cult that likes to call itself feminism so it can feed off the name recognition of the real movement, but in reality is a bunch of airheads on tumblr who like to think they're being oppressed and are always the victim. News flash (Yes, it's supposed to be two words, not one)! YOU ARE NOT ALWAYS THE VICTIM, NOT ALL MEN WANT TO RAPE WOMEN, AND JUST BECAUSE MEN HIT ON WOMEN DOES NOT MAKE IT SEXIST. It's called complimenting, you do it so the person you're complimenting thinks better of you and wants to be in a relationship with you or wants to sleep with you. It's not degrad<b> ing sex</b>ism.\n\nOn another note, there is absolutely no problem with men having no fear of women. Women shouldn't even be afraid of men. In this day<b>  and</b> age, size doesn't matter anymore because of a little thing called a weapon. You can easily conceal a handgun in a purse or under a coat/shirt (assuming you have proper permits) and if your country doesn't have guns, you can have a knife and conceal that (assuming proper permits and all of that malarkey).\u00a0\n\nOn an entirely other note. Men get butt hurt <b> about g</b>ender discussions? Men act irrationally and selfishly in these inst<b> ances? Mi</b>sandry is sarcastic horri<b> ble but m</b>isogyny is reality terrible? Men are insulting whole populations but tumblr \"feminists\" aren't? Tumblr \"feminism (the kind you're preaching here) isn't about male oppression? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!! That is the the most stupid thing I have ever heard someone like you say! HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!\n\nOn my final note, in the first world, women have it really well off in every social aspect of life and slightly less well off in the workplace. Men in the first world have it s**t in social aspects of life (I mean relationships, of course, not necessarily just forming friendships and the more superficial aspects) and slightly better than women in the workplace (probably because a really large majority of fathers work, whereas a smaller percentage of mothers work). As was mentioned previously in this comments section, men have to really work to find a partner. When they find one, they have to work hard to keep both her and their money (which the women usually dips into that money as well, both directly and indirectly). If any of those moving parts slips for a second, the girl is out of there with whatever stuff the man tried to provide her with. This i<b> s a ver</b>y common scenario, which I've seen my friends go through several times. If you want women to be taken seriously, then women need to start pulling their weight. Pay for dinner, go out of your way to make the man happy, be there when he needs you, and (most importantly) RECIPROCATE. The two of you are in a partnership. To the best of my understanding, partnership means the effort and reward is divided equally. If the man has put up with all sorts of crap, you should have to put up with crap too.\n\nOff of that side tangent (final one, promise). You are wrong. Just accept it and the cause you are supposedly championing might be taken a little more seriously. #BanBossy #YeahRight",

Instead of showing people a better way, you just come off as offensive and rude, hence all the \"Fuck off\"s. There are many types of feminists, and no, feminism is not the only group that seeks to better the world, neither do real feminists see feminism as some type of cure all answer. I suggest you do what some of the more experienced feminists try to do. Study feminist literature, ideology and history, and try to develop your skills at supporting your cause, esp how you argue your point and talk to people. Not every person you speak to will accept what you have to say, that's just life, relax.",

People yelling things at me happens most days. I'm about 7ft tall, that's unusual so people want to react to that. I get that, but it doesn't stop me from being annoyed at them in the moment. \nYou talked about the people who are yelling things as \"<b> pigs\"</b> which is fine, you're judging the action as inappropriate, but in the same breath you blame the people who they're yelling at. Why? Are you saying that men aren't smart enough not to be <b> \"pigs</b>\" when they see someone dressed like a \"slut\"? \n\nMy problem with this video is that it depends on the idea that these incidents where perpetrated by MEN against WOMEN, as opposed to each one by a man against <b> a woma</b>n. The oversimplification propagates the war of the sexes thing and gets us nowhere, especially in this case; because they're preaching to the choir. It seems unlikely that anyone who does this will see it. \n\nYour attitude however makes me just as irritated. Describing people who are reacting with irritation as being given a load shit from people that they don't know in the streets for no reason as \"bitches\"? Really!? Do you honestly think that works toward making anything better?",

Men and women arent the same plus it just seems to show if a <b> woman </b>did it to a man they wouldnt really be offended or kick up much of a fuss. Doubt many men will randomly go up to women and ask them to go home with them in the middle of the day. In the shop if men asked for another man to help them its probably because in that certain department men know more generally in that area, like in DIY they generally will. Basically feminists gotta chill out, pointless video",

And how would you react if u compliment a guy who works-out, and he get's offended c'z u'r looking at his muscles ? would you be like , oooh i totally understand, i even shouldn't have been looking. where you then in his business, c'z he takes his business on the streets and don't even mind to cover it c'z he wants to show with it ? doesn't make any sense, does it ?\nAnd if u want a man who doesn't do all of these things, u basicly saying that all men who don't hit on you are good /normal men ?",

I watched this video because I seriously think about becoming a pick up artist. Go in the street, caf\u00e9,etc  approach men I find attractive, ask their phone number and put them on a damned list. Not only because I want to denounce something but because I desire this. I'm a wolf trapped in a bambi body.",

When judging if something is sexist I suppose you have to check if assumptions/judgements are being made about a person's character, capabilities, intelligence or the acceptability of their actions based solely on their <b> gender.</b> In the case of asking someone you've never met before \"do you want to come back to mine?\" I'd certainly say that it's too forward not to make most people feel uncomfortable and because of that it's probably a bit inappropriate. But inherently sexist? I'm not so sure. It's a question therefore offering the other person a choice as opposed to making any assumptions about them, so probably not. I'm not endorsing it as a way to introduce yourself, but \"sexist\" isn't a very accurate way to describe it.",
