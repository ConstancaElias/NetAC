Ghislaine woke me up in the morning and said, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna meet a prince today.\u201d', '\u2018I didn\u2019t know at that point that I was going to be trafficked to a prince.', '\u2018We went out to Club Tramp. Prince Andrew got me alcohol, it was in the VIP section. I\u2019m pretty sure it was vodka.', '\u2018He was like, \u201cLet\u2019s dance\u201d. I was like, \u201cOK\u201d. We leave club Tramp and I hop in the car with Ghislaine and Jeffrey.', '\u2018She says, \u201che\u2019s coming back to the house and I want you to do for him what you do for Epstein.\u201d', 'She then says the pair had sex in the toilet of Ghislaine\u2019s townhouse.', 'She added: \u2018He wasn\u2019t rude or anything about it, he said, \u201cthank you\u201d and some kind of soft sentiments like that and left\u2019.', 'Buckingham Palace says it \u2018emphatically\u2019 denies the Duke of York had \u2018any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts\u2019.', 'A previous Palace statement said: \u2018The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s alleged crimes.', '\u2018His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.\u2019",
