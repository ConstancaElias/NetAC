        "postText": "A racist troll has been shamed online after telling a woman \u2018sorry I don\u2019t like non whites lol\u2019 on Plenty of Fish.', 'Sophia Anwar, 33, reported the abusive messages to police and shared them on Facebook with the caption: \u2018For those who think these things no longer happen.\u2019', 'Plenty of Fish says it has since banned the man\u2019s account but police are taking no further action.', 'Bank worker Sophia said the Glasgow man, 35, who calls himself GunsRunDevil, messaged her out of the blue and although she never responded, told her: \u2018I stick to my own race thanks very much.\u2019', 'Outraged by the two unprovoked messages, Sophia responded: \u2018I didn\u2019t make any contact with you. With a face like that you really shouldn\u2019t narrow your choices as you\u2019ll be lucky if anyone fancies you.', 'She added: \u2018Your opinions are outdated and primitive. Tbf, I wouldn\u2019t expect anything else from a neanderthal like you.\u2019', 'Sophia, from Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, noticed the mystery man was wearing a black work uniform with an indecipherable logo on the chest.', 'She added: \u2018Good going in having pics in your uniform up on here. I\u2019ve shared your comments and pics on social media. It won\u2019t be long till your employer sees it.\u2019', 'Sophia said she was \u2018shocked\u2019 and \u2018disgusted\u2019 by the messages, that left her in tears.', 'She added: \u2018I didn\u2019t know what was happening and had to read it a few times. Then I cried.', '\u2018I\u2019m disgusted, but with the current state of affairs it feels like it\u2019s going to happen more often.', '\u2018Which is why I felt it was important to report it to the police.\u2019', 'People tore into the unknown man online, with Alan Goldie commenting on Sophia\u2019s post: \u2018Not only a racist, but he\u2019s about as attractive as a syphilitic boil on the a*** of a tapeworm up a rat\u2019s hole.\u2019', 'Stacy Sinclair said: \u2018Somebody should tell the d***head white women won\u2019t want him either with a s*** attitude like that.\u2019', 'Police Scotland say they are not investigating the matter any further.', 'A spokeswoman said: \u2018Police can confirm that a member of the public reported comments made online. The woman intimated that she was not making a complaint.', '\u2018Appropriate advice was given and there is no ongoing investigation.\u2019', 'A Plenty of Fish spokesperson told Metro.co.uk: \u2018At Plenty of Fish, we care deeply about our community, and work to ensure the safety and security of all who encounter our platform.', '\u2018We have a number of systems and preventative processes in place designed to help support and protect our members, and a zero-tolerance policy for anyone reported for these types of incidents on Plenty of Fish.', '\u2018We have now located the user\u2019s profile and the account has been banned.', '\u2018We encourage users to report inappropriate behaviour so we can take appropriate actions against bad actors, which can include removing them from our platform as soon as possible.\u2019",

Stay single, save your money, live your life and don't let other people's ridiculous high double standards get you down. Theres definitely plenty of fish out there but only small minded sardines on POF app.",

When someone doesn't reply, they checked out your profile and saw something that made them think they would not get on with you. Just as any man would. Just because you like someone, doesn't mean they have to like you back and respond to you. Online dating is not two dimensional. When you see someone in real life you already know whether you fancy them or not and if they fancy you because you get a response, so you take it from there. Online, that is not so true. Not sure why people get upset at that. Everyone makes selections based on their criteria. As for this <b> racist </b>guy - she responded because that was an awful thing to do, not because she was intrigued by him. Do you not get the subtle difference there?",

I haven't heard about Pakistani people emailing white people telling them they stick to their o<b> wn ra</b>ce. However, there are complex reasons why people marry within certain groups, not all to do w<b> ith r</b>ace but more to do with culture or religion. And no, he would not be a homophobe if he chose heterosexual relationships because you can't choose sexuality just as you can't choose <b> your </b>race. But he would be a homophobe if he tar<b> get<b> ed<<b> /b</b</b>>> LGBT people only to taunt them about their sexuality. I really don't know how to explain this better to a person that doesn't understand a very bold, rather than fine, line on this issue.",
