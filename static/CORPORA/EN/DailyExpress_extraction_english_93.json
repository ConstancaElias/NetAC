        "postText": "'Speaking on STV\u2019s Edinburgh Festival Late Show last night he said: It was taken totally out of context. It was a piece of harmless innuendo, nothing more than that.', 'The former Scottish first minister was criticised for making the crude joke on the first night of a show he\u2019s performing during the Edinburgh Festival.', 'He told the audience: I promised you today we\u2019d either have Theresa May or Nicola Sturgeon or Ruth Davidson or Melania Trump but I couldn\u2019t make any of these wonderful women come...', 'That was followed by a drumroll before he added: ...to the show.', 'His successor Ms Sturgeon was not impressed, saying in response earlier this week that Mr Salmond is not always as funny as he thinks he is.', 'She added: Perhaps this is an example of a joke that perhaps belongs more in the Benny Hill era than it does in the modern era.', 'During yesterday\u2019s show, Mr Salmond admitted he was a fan of the comedian, who had his heyday in the Seventies.', 'He said: Actually, Benny Hill was quite talented.I mean, he made a living for years on television so he didnae do too badly.', The politician's show 'Unleashed' has been advertised as a bit of light - hearted banter with a few behind the scenes revelations about his time in power,', 'Each show involves the appearance of a special guest, which prompted Mr Salmond to make his crude quip about the female politicians on Saturday.', 'While he has defended the joke as \u201charmless\u201d, others have said it is damaging and sexist.', 'GETTY', 'Labour MSP Monica Lennon called the comment a \u201chorrendous example to young men\u201d.', 'The Scottish Labour equalities spokesman, said: \u201cIt would be wrong to laugh these comments off as a bit of banter \u2013this is a former First Minister degrading female politicians.', '\u201cAlex Salmond should know comments like these are simply unacceptable and he should apologise.', '\u201cIt would set a horrendous example to young men if he tries to hide behind these sexist comments as risqu\u00e9 humour.\u201d', 'And Talat Yaqoob, co-founder of the cross-party Women 50:50 group, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it is an appropriate joke to be making.', '\u201cAside from it not being particularly funny, it illustrates the sexism women experience despite being at a high level of leadership.', '\u201cAny such sexualisation by a former First Minister is particularly disappointing as he should be more aware of the impact of his words.'",
