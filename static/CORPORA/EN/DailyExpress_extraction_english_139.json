        "postText": "The authors John Le Carr\u00e9 and William Boyd were joined by actors Simon Callow and Joanna Lumley in signing a letter, in which they wrote that they could not bring themselves to vote for the party, on account of its abject handling of the issue. The letter was published in the Guardian on Thursday. Other signatories included Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, and the historians Antony Beevor, Tom Holland and Dan Snow, as well as Trevor Phillips, a former Labour politician and ex-chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).', 'The signatories attacked Mr Corbyn for trying to use Brexit to bury the ongoing controversies over anti-Semitism.', 'They wrote: \u201cWe listen to our Jewish friends and see how their pain has been relegated as an issue, pushed aside by arguments about Britain\u2019s European future.', '\u201cFor those who insist that Labour are the only alternative to Boris Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit, now, it seems, is not the time for Jewish anxiety.', '\u201cBut antisemitism is central to a wider debate about the kind of country we want to be.', '\u201cTo ignore it because Brexit looms larger is to declare that anti-Jewish prejudice is a price worth paying for a Labour government.', '\u201cWhich other community\u2019s concerns are disposable in this way? Who would be next?', '\u201cOpposition to racism cannot include surrender in the fight against antisemitism.', '\u201cYet that is what it would mean to back Labour and endorse Mr Corbyn for Downing Street.\u201d', 'The writers conclude: \u201cThe path to a more tolerant society must encompass Britain\u2019s Jews with unwavering solidarity.', '\u201cWe endorse no party. However, we cannot in all conscience urge others to support a political party we ourselves will not. We refuse to vote Labour on 12 December.\u201d', 'A Labour party spokesperson hit back, claiming that the party takes anti-Semitism \u201cextremely seriously\u2019 and was taking \u201crobust action\u201d to root it out.', 'The spokesperson also accused some of the signatories of having \u201cthemselves been accused of antisemitism, Islamophobia and misogyny.\u201d', 'Last week the Jewish Chronicle urged voters to reject Jeremy Corbyn at the ballot box on account of the party\u2019s anti-semitism.', 'In an impassioned front page article, it said: \u201dThroughout his career, he has allied with and supported antisemites such as Paul Eisen, Stephen Sizer and Raed Salah.', '\u201cHe has described organisations like Hamas, whose founding charter commits it to the extermination of every Jew on the planet as his \u201cfriends\u201d.', '\u201cHe has laid a wreath to honour terrorists who have murdered Jews.', '\u201cWe believe that the overwhelming majority of British people abhor racism. We ask only that when you cast your vote, you act on that.\u201d', 'In reply to the article, Mr Corbyn insisted that he was not an antisemite and had worked all his life to fight against all forms of racism.', 'He said: \u201dAnti-Semitism is a poison and an evil in our society.', '\u201cAny form of racism is a poison and an evil in our society.', '\u201cI have spent my whole life fighting against racism. I will die an anti-racist.\u201d",
