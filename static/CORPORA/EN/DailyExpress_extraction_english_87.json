        "postText": "Good Morning Britain presenters Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid discussed the viability of the SAS hiring female troopers.', 'And their guests, former SAS members Rusty Firmin and Phil Campion, were brought onto the show to discuss the topic, and things quickly got heated.', 'Piers began the debate by simply asking: \u201cWhat is your problem with having women in the SAS?\u201d', 'To which Rusty quickly replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem i\u2019m just old school.', '\u201cWe have the best forces and we\u2019ve taken a long time to get there.\u201d', 'Later in the discussion Rusty added: \u201cMale and female officers serving together is not a good idea - and it\u2019s not all about passing a test by the way. It\u2019s about the hardships they go through.\u201d', 'Susanna jumped in to ask: \u201cAre you worried about relationships?\u201d', 'Leaving Rusty to admit: \u201cYes, and wives would be more worried than me.\u201d', 'While Phil was not opposed to the notion of having women in the SAS, he did mention he would like to see \u201cthe whole package\u201d from any recruit.', 'Itching for an answer Piers asked: \u201cIf it\u2019s not about physical brute force what is it about any woman not being able to get through?\u201d', 'He went on to ask them: \u201cIs there a whiff of sexism from you two?\u201d', 'Both of the guests furious denied the claim, saying: \u201cNo, no, not at all!\u201d', 'Rusty then defended his views, explaining: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the British army here, not foreign armies.\u201d', 'And when Piers asked: \u201cWould you trust a woman you\u2019re fighting alongside to cover your back?\u201d Rusty bluntly responded: \u201cNo I would not.\u201d', 'And viewers themselves were outraged by the idea as well, with one writing on Twitter: \u201cWe are saying its elite and women cant do it\u2026 YES WOMEN can\u2026 like anything it\u2019s being given a chance, and having belief in the person #gmb.\u201d', 'Another wrote: \u201c#GMB respect for SAS. Yes to women being allowed a chance for selection.\u201d', '\u201cWomen in the SAS, why not? This is about capability not sexuality. #GMB,\u201d a third added.', 'Meanwhile some agreed with the SAS members, saying: \u201cWomen shouldn\u2019t be in the SAS. If you don\u2019t understand why then you probably don\u2019t appreciate what the SAS do #GMB.\u201d', 'With another agreeing: \u201cStandard people on Twitter don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about again. Women should not be allowed to join the SAS #GMB.\u201d', 'Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.",

Ignoring all the chaffing that comes with having a full Bergan on your back on the first timed march along with the blisters you get that both get worse on each march.Then they will have a chance. Then if they can be dropped into the Borneo jungle quite literally from 1,000 ft to lean combat training where they will get split up into groups of four where they after rely on each other as they learn how to survive in an hostile environment undetected by the enemy who are your own people hunting for you surviving fast flowing rivers as they are detected and they are escaping if they can survive all that and much more when on their probation period where they will at least once walk out from a high altitude aircraft 30000 ft above the ground with enough equipment to start world war three then I dont have any objection.But it has to exactly like the men do with not even an ounce taken from their packs.",
