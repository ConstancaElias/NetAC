        "postText": "'Students, male and female, taking their exams in summer 2017 were given 15 minutes extra after dons ruled  according to the Daily Telegraph. ', 'No changes were made to the length or difficulty of the questions on the paper.', ' They trialed the change in a bid to help women achieve higher results, after just seven female maths final year students getting a first last year, compared to 45 men.', 'Some academics reportedly voiced concerns about the changes calling them sexist.', ' But a spokesman defended the university\u2019s move, saying it was academically demanding and fair, and pointed out that although 39 per cent of female maths undergraduates achieved first class degrees compared to 47 per cent of men, women\u2019 s scores have been rising year on year. ', ' A document obtained by the Times, under the Freedom of Information act, showed that faculty at the university believed the changes could mitigate the...gender gap that has arisen in recent years, and in any case the exam should be a demonstration of mathematical understanding and not a time trial.', 'However, the lengthening of exams was welcomed by some female students. ', 'Antonia Siu, Undergraduate Representative of Oxford Women in Computer Science, said: I am uneasy about schemes to favour one gender over another.', ' But I am happy when people see gaps between groups of people who should not reasonably have such gaps - such as between genders, races or class - and take that as a starting point to think about the kinds of people they unintentionally are leaving behind.', 'Oxford University it would continue to monitor exam data carefully, but noted female exam students did show an imporvaement with the extra time.', 'An Oxford University spokesman told Business Insider:  As part of an ongoing review of our examination process, the Mathematical Institute in Oxford decided to extend its 90 - minute examinations to 105 minutes for all students. ', 'We believe that this extra time allows us to better determine which students have gained the fullest understanding of the course material, in a way which remains academically demanding and fair.', 'We are encouraged to note that following these changes, women have performed better in our examinations. However, it is too soon to draw firm conclusions from this evidence.'",

This is yet another example of lowering standards because women can't compete with men when measured by existing standards.We have seen it in the Fire Service, Police Force and Armed Forces to their detriment. Exams are supposed to be challenging so that the best performers can demonstrate their prowess to employers among others. This is just a leveling down of standards, so that weaker candidates can appear as capable as stronger candidates.It 's anti-meritocratic and <b> sex </b>discriminatory.",
