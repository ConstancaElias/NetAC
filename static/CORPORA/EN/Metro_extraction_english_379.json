        "postText": "Three people have died and more than 100 people have suffered severe bleeding from smoking weed believed to be laced with rat poison.', 'The deaths all happened in the state of Illinois but four other states have reported cases.', 'Tests have been carried out on the synthetic weed and several patients and they came back positive for a lethal ingredient often used in rat poison.', 'The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued a national alert patients with severe, unexplained bleeding may be additional cases.', 'The CDC is helping Illinois authorities investigate the outbreak in that state, which began in early March. Illinois reported seven more cases on Tuesday, bringing the nationwide total to at least 116.', 'Symptoms include coughing up blood, blood in the urine, severe bloody noses, bleeding gums and internal bleeding.', 'CDC\u2019s alert says outside Illinois, emergency rooms in Indiana, Missouri, Wisconsin and Maryland have treated affected patients since March 10.', 'Illnesses have been linked to fake marijuana before but this is the first outbreak involving rat poison contamination, said the CDC\u2019s Renee Funk. Those sickened require hospitalization and treatment with vitamin K to control bleeding, she said.', '\u2018This is an unusual outbreak,\u2019 Funk said Tuesday, adding that is unclear how the contamination occurred.', 'Fake marijuana, also called synthetic cannabinoids, contains man-made chemicals that produce a high similar to marijuana. It is sold in smoke shops and other stores as liquids that can be used in e-cigarettes or in dried plant material that can be smoked. Nicknames include K2, Spice and Kush.', '\u2018The number of cases continues to go up each day,\u2019 Melaney Arnold, spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Public Health, said Tuesday. \u2018Synthetic cannabinoids in general are not safe and this is one example of not knowing what chemicals are in the product. We are telling people don\u2019t use synthetic cannabinoids.\u2019', 'The federal government and many states have banned some of these products or specific ingredients, but the CDC says manufacturers skirt these laws by creating new products or labeling them \u2018not for human consumption.\u2019', 'Tests on fake pot bought at a Chicago convenience store by undercover agents detected the rat poison ingredient, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office said in a news release. Three store employees were arrested and face federal drug charges.', 'Illnesses from fake marijuana have increased in recent years; a CDC report noted at least 456 cases between 2010 and 2015. The products are up to 100 times more potent than the active ingredient in marijuana and severe reactions have included seizures, coma and delirium.",

If you\u2019re butthurt by the truth, we\u2019ll just keep accepting what you\u2019re being spoon-fed by society and the government. But when you realize that the majority of us who believe this are right, I\u2019ll feel really sorry for you because it will be too late then. Study the koran a little and you\u2019ll understand...if you\u2019re a Christian...they hate you! If you don\u2019t convert to Islam, they want you dead...And they will do whatever it takes to gain control of our country. Like selling fake weed at the corner stores laced with dangerous chemicals.",

You all that are so against a natural plant should fight against all the other drugs that <b> doctors </b>prescribe.Read up on all the side effects and ingredients of \" legal\" drugs . Cigarettes are worse for you than weed. What about<b>  alcohol</b>? Its legal , but research what it does to your body, and it kills every day, those who consume it and those around it.How many die every day from drunk drivers? They should have bucked up to the masses during the prohibition and kept it illegal. The world would be a better place if they had grown a pair and kept it that way. It would have blown over like every thing else does eventually. At least weed has medicinal purposes.And , really, alot of smokers help the economy by buying more munchies. Lol",

Pot and crack are no where near the same thing and you dont use the same implements to consume them.",

Only plant to cure and relief all viruses n diseases ALL. Never in history has it killed or cause anyone harm, only while driving a vehicle just like liquor. But this was not sold legally nor is spice more healthy and natural than weed. Youll die or be hospitalized instantly with spice, and especially rat poison.  Meaning theyre purposely killing ppl who use weed, bc it has way more benefits than cons. Only con is if u smoke tooooooo much bc smoke is nvr supposed to go in lungs.",

Then, those who don\u2019t know buy the stuff and end up dead or in life-threatening crisis. Another reason for NOT legalizing it is that folks who DON\u2019T need it for medicinal reasons are getting high anyway. So, we will have a society now and in the future of slow-minded, zombie creatures roaming the country. Gonna pick leaders from THAT bunch? Good luck with that. We\u2019re already skewed NOW.",
