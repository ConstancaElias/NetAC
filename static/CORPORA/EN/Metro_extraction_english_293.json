        "postText": "One of London\u2019s biggest gay nightclubs has complained of \u2018social cleansing\u2019 after being given three months to close to make way for a \u00a31.3bn development.', 'XXL has been running for 19 years and 40 people will lose their jobs when the venue shuts down.', 'It comes as the capital\u2019s gay scene has become \u2018crippled\u2019 over recent years with people saying LGBT spaces are needed more than ever as societal attitudes \u2018go backwards\u2019.', 'The club\u2019s co-manager James McNeil says the venue is one of the few serving the 30-plus community, the Guardian reports.', 'He said: \u2018It is like we have been socially cleansed of LGBT venues. There are people who haven\u2019t come out who will go there because it is a safe zone.\u2019', 'A \u00a31.3bn development consisting of 489 flats, shops, a hotel and offices is set to replace the legendary nightspot.', 'The club\u2019s owners lost a court appeal this week against the developers, who are bankrolled by investors from Malaysia and Singapore.', 'Both Mr McNeil and co-founder Mark Ames asked if the illegality of gay sex in both Asian countries has anything to do with the project.', 'Development firm Native Land strongly deny this suggestion.', 'They said XXL had known about the development plans since 2014 and didn\u2019t object to them when they were first submitted.', 'But Mr McNeil says this is because a planning tribunal had already asserted their right to carry on as a gay club.', 'He also said they wanted to work with the developers to create \u2018the first national LGBTQ centre\u2019 but the idea wasn\u2019t picked up.', 'The managers also allege the Mayor of London\u2019s office hasn\u2019t provided enough help to stay open over the past few years.', 'London\u2019s first \u2018Night Czar\u2019 Amy Lam\u00e9 said her team had been looking for new premises, lobbying Southwark Council and offering advice to XXL staff.\u2019', 'The club now has three months to shut up shop and make way for the project which will be built over railway arches and on nearby land.', 'Regular performer DJ Fat Tony, real name Tony Marnach, said London \u2018can\u2019t afford\u2019 to lose another large gay venue.', 'He added: \u2018The gay scene has been so crippled over the last few years. We [still] need gay clubs because the world we live in is not going forwards, it is going backwards.', '\u2018In some areas of London people still can\u2019t walk down the street together.\u2019', 'The number of gay clubs in London has plummeted from 125 in 2006 to 53 in 2017, according to research by University College London.', 'Out of these, 30 per cent became venues that weren\u2019t specifically gay and 21 per cent closed to make way for property development.', 'The latest casualty was Boc South in Vauxhall this month, having only opened in 2017.', 'XXL co-founder Mark Ames said the trend showed there was \u2018no room for difference\u2019 and that everything was becoming \u2018sterilised\u2019.', 'He added: \u2018This is being done by people who don\u2019t care about London\u2019s community. All they care about is turning a buck.\u2019",
