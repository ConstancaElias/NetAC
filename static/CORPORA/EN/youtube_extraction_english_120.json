                    "commentText": "Exactly, I'm young and every time I've been discriminated based on my experience it's because I don't have any, being just 20 years <b> old.</b> Honestly, I think that as young people we shouldn't be whining about<b>  age</b> discrimination because we're still far from reaching the top of the income ladder which is during our 50s. What I usually see is people that could continue working and become even more productive being set aside because they're seen as to<b> o ol</b>d and unfit for the job. Society has to realize that not every person's income has to peak at around the ages of 50 some people are extraordinarily healthy and would fare better as employees if they had the possibility to at least prove they could extend their income gains up until around they reach 70. Top executives are able to prove to society that they are better workers in their 60s than in their 50s and 40s but most people don't even have that possibility, that is ruled out for most people who don't belong to the elites. Donald Trump is 70 and I don't s<b> ee a</b>ge as being the reason that would make him unfit to be president of the USA, maybe other reasons may exist, but <b> not </b>age because he walks well for someone<b>  his</b> age and he reasons the same way he reasoned about issues when he was in his 30s so he doesn't have any form of dementia. But still, the media promotes the belief that politicians should be young and energetic, and people prefer to be represented by the younger and less experienced politicians. But why? Do people want to do physical exercise with their young and also the sexiest prime minister ever (media), Justin Trudeau? I generally think it's risky to put very young people who haven't proven themselves in very high positions, particularly in investment banking, for instance, which is what's happening nowadays. For for-profit corporations, investment advisories and the like being young, energetic, and educated at an Ivy League shouldn't even be seen as an asset, rather they should be seen as a risk factors. It used to be that way, just look at what happened to Stroh Brewery after a Harvard brain with no experience and \"notebook\" notions of risk and management took over his family company. As a young person I've always been weary of taking a job which I know it will be very difficult to significantly start climbing up the income ladder when I'm 30 because I know I wasn't educated at an Ivy League institution, thus I I'll never have the possibility of landing a 100k job even with relatively little marketable technical skills like it happens with Ivy alumni nowadays, but still I want to continually learn and become more productive. Also, I know that when I reach an <b> olde</b>r age I'll probably be healthier than most peo<b> ple </b>my age so I'd want an employer who knows how to calculate employee productivity so I could extend my income ladder gains to match my productivity gains. Ideally, we could live in a world in which everyone retired when they wanted or when they were really unfit, but we don't live in a world like that and the main fault is people. My paternal grandfather is 80 and semi-retired though he only really retired at around 75, when he reached the peak of his career, being very competitive I've always wanted to be like him when growing up, but that's next to impossible if you're not self-employed or already in the top of the income chain. I can bet with anyone that as more and more people in their 30s and early 40s are given more control of operational activities in investment banking and the like, whereas employees still in their 50s enter retirement mainly as a result of crowd thinking and too much academization of business, it will harder and harder to find large companies which can handle important and informed decisions for their clients in a professional manner. They say the world is data driven and we need people who have knowledge in acquiring it, and the best to bother learning new systems and processes on a weekly basis are the young. But how are they the most productive if they're also genera<b> lly t</b>oo dumb to understand the signicance and insignifance of the researched data? Every older investor realized instantly that high-frequency trading was doomed towards abismal failure through easy deductive logical reasoning but the young careless silver spooners didn't. \"The best CEO is an<b>  80 </b>year old male inside his office during the day, thinking and reading\", Charlie Munger.",

I experienced the same bullshit 20 years ago with the lower pay when you are younger.

I'm not talking 80 years <b> old </b>here or even 60 but 40s-50s primarily. This isn't an ;older vs younger issue with me. This warped society does not look at merit and ability as much as it does<b>  age</b> whether that be younger or older. Think about it, you get it hit with it when you are younger and then hit your 40s-50s and people as well as employers etc begin hitting you with it again. Not always in the same categories but it is an attempt to marginalize and limit you just the same.",
