 "postText": " Ageism is a problem in the modern day workplace, but it may be much more so in the tech industry. At Google if an employee is over 40 they are called a greygler. Even if someone is over 30 they are not as prized as those in their 20s. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian (The Point) hosts of The Young Turks discuss. Do you think ageism is a problem in the tech industry or are they correct in only hiring young people? Let us know in the comments below. Read more here: http://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-wo... There's no question the tech industry is filled with satisfying, high paying jobs. But a career in tech comes with a deadline of sorts. After you turn 50, you'll likely find yourself struggling for job security and respect. In tech these days, people in their 20's are worshiped. Young people are just smarter, Mark Zuckerberg infamously said back in 2007. People in their 30's are tolerated. Don't fund anyone over 30 was the unwritten VC rule back in 2007, too. Tech workers in their 40's are starting to look over their shoulder. (A group at Google called Greyglers is for Google employees over 40.) As for people in their 50's? Many are under tremendous stress. And those in their 60s and older are very hard to find. Even CEOs over a certain age face a constant stream of when-are-you-going-retire questions. ",

I don't think that there is any difference in intelligence between folks in different age brackets. Also, the longer someone has been in the workforce, the more valuable experience that person has. I'm 35 and the fact that Google would probably see me as an aging portion of the population (better get ready for the is folks home!) is ridiculous. That's absurd. I look at people in their 50's, 60's and 70's and they don't seem even remotely old to me. This just seems discriminatory and silly.",

    "commentText": "Cenk, to what you say about one age group being smarter than another, I say you might want to consider the impact of technology on a young developing mind. The younger generations in some forms literally are smarter. They do perform better in certain areas than older people (im talking 20's versus mid 30's & 40's), and its the exposure to technology throughout their life when they were younger which causes that to happen. The older generations did not have the same exposure while their brains were developing and much more plastic. There are facts that point towards the truth of it. What you're referencing as 'tech-savvy' is more than simply having the ability to work well with a computer or a smartphone...I think it's actually indicative of a set of skills which relates to mental abilities such as memory, cognition, and comprehension. To me, it makes sense why technology would improve on these mental skills....I can also see how the younger generations had more exposure to this than older people for obvious reasons, and how that would cause younger adults to have the edge in certain areas where older ones dont perform as well",

It sounds ridiculous and everyone calls me an uneducated prick but I'm speaking the advice that was given to me by many of my mentors: You should start investing and saving after your first paycheck or after the first dollar you make and you should have enough assets to cover your retirement fund by 40. Many of them did that which is why 4/5 of them are at least multimillionaires. Also, if you are working a job in the tech industry, by the age of 40 you should be in a (preferably higher level) management position and shouldn't be doing direct coding or hardware. Why? Because Zucks is right. The younger people are smarter and tech savvyier, but older people have more experience. That's why as an older person you should be managing and mentoring the younger people and building the tech (and tech professionals) of tomorrow. \n\nThanks for the video.",

All I've taken is an online test created by Mensa Denmark. It's in Danish but \"menu\" and \"send\" means the same in both Danish and English and are the buttons you have to push once you're done. Anything else is intuitive as you have a 3x3 column and have to fill out the blank cell by clicking the one best fitting the pattern. Spoilers. The first question lists you 8 red balls. What should the 9th symbol? If you think another red ball then you click that one below.  \n\nhttps://mensa.dk/sites/default/files/index.swf\n\nYour IQ is predominantly tied to early brain development (mostly the pre-natal kind) and almost can't be influenced at all once you pass 21 years of age where your brain is fully developed. I've nonetheless heard it can be improved by 5 points over time which is fairly insignificant in practice. I've taken the above test once when I was 14 and once again when I was 23 (you're never told if you answered correctly so you can't really cheat). The test changed a bit and I scored 124 the first time but 132 the second time. Some of that improvement could possibly be attributed to the inaccuracy of the test though.",

Mainly because most of the older workers that keep up with the evolving field move up in the company or tend to be well known to some extent. Also that the education of this field has become more in demand/accessible and more advanced. Like projects a long time ago that took months may take days now. Which also has other factors to it like they might have just started to develop that software (as in no one had yet) or hardware issues. But the main point still stands that education for the field has grown making more people able to work in it and the field has also become more complex depending on the job. I realize that this is not always the case and that most older workers are still fine at their jobs for this field (I have learned most of what i know from being an intern for the field under older workers. Which makes me agree that experience is best teacher in this field) but even points made in the video such as maybe paying an older worker more when you could get someone younger for less who might have a stronger education in the field. From a business stand point it makes the most sense unless your marketing yourself that you keep older workers.",

Some people in their twenties are still dumb as shit, while some in their forties are wiser about the choices they make in buisness.  The opposite is also true.\n\nWhat has been the case in the past is that younger people are more able to handle new technology than older generations.  But this might be changing as modern generations go through rapid tech changes where as in the past each generation might have one or two true advances.  Those that were there for the rise of the internet are able to keep up with these advances much better than their contemporaries of previous generations.  Those that are teenagers today will be able to keep up with tech changes for even longer.  There eventually will come a generation that never truly falls behind.\n\nHonestly if we really want to consider ourselves advanced things like ageism can't be considered useful.",

If you just graduated with a degree in computer science, your degree is worth a lot more than someone who got the same degree in the 1960's. So even though a 65 year old's résumé might be better than a 24 year old's, it doesn't mean they are more qualified and how do you necessarily find out which one is more qualified other than their résumé? You look at their age, because a majority of the time, but not always, it will be the best indicator as to which one is actually up to date with the current technology. So a little bit of ageism is not the worst thing in the world in all cases.",

If it wasn't the case and there was actual evidence that older people knew more about this kind of stuff, these companies would be hiring them over young people. You can come up with whatever bullshit PC opinion you like, but the evidence speaks for itself: These companies, which are some of the most successful companies in the world, have found that younger people are better than older people in this particular field of work. And this is only for the actual tech jobs, I'm sure none of these companies would ever consider hiring a young lawyer fresh out of law school for legal consulting or to defend them when they get sued, because in that field, older people are better. People talk about ageism like it's equivalent to racism, it's not, old people and young people are actually different, both mentally and physically, and they both have their unique strengths and weaknesses.",

        "commentText": "+markalexander774 Your analysis is too broad sweeping. Those who graduated earlier have their degrees plus hands on experience. Most new grads are a drag on corporate expenses until they get up to speed in the project they are assigned to. \n\nNow of course if an engineer/tech person doesn't update their skill set, then their value will decrease compared to new grads, but just taking new post grad language or tech classes can easily maintain the latest technology. Most colleges don't teach the latest software programming being uses by companies. \n\nExperience also gives one seasoning in networking and customer/corporate relations in getting your ideas across. \n\nThe biggest reason older folks are swapped for younger is the cost savings. Two young engineers can be hired at the salary of one senior experienced engineer, and many companies will take the risk at a loss of productivity for a while to get that savings. Older employees accumulate bigger benefit payouts over time which translates to a drag on profits. \n\nWith the Great Recession, many senior engineers have accepted lower paying jobs that typical went to new grads. This has resulted in millennials having a harder time getting in as companies are choosing experience over youth for the same rate of pay.",

However, most film analysis experts will say that the level of complexity in the story structures of todays fiction are actually much more complex and have more dynamics to them. This is an average, but it generally holds true, obviously every work is not going to be better with every tick of the clock and obviously every work in one year will be better than the ones prior. Essentially your claim is that because people are taller on average today  that there were no short people before.  Take one look at BoJack Horseman, Rick and Morty, Jessica Jones, Orange is the New Black, or any of the other more complex popular fictions today, even something like harry potter, and you will find many more layers than earlier work, and much more depth as far as character development and behavior. Joke all you want, but that is the reality. In fact even in children's shows a whole science has been developed in order to make the show increase the intelligence of children, such shows created based on the scientific analysis of what makes kids smarter are Blues Clues and Sesame Street.",

Once a pattern or method is made obvious it becomes incredibly simple. Everyone who goes through highschool for the most part has all of the tools Isaac Newton spent his whole life developing. The everyday person has an understanding of theoretical physics far beyond any people before. From a neurological standpoint we are debatably less intelligent than the average neanderthall, who we interbred with for a short while, but all in all, yes, today we are smarter than we ever have been, and unless something crazy happens the same will be true in 40 years etc. This is more than simply biology, rather it is a combination of biology and learning, more advanced learning, leads to even more advanced learning, and with the same tools it can still grow. The human brain is incredibly advanced and our culture still has not caught up to its fullest potential I dont think it ever will. Just as a turing machine is complex enough to run any code, so too is our brain just complex enough to think almost any thought. (with the obvious exception of quantum computing)",

When I was in my 20s, couldn't afford hardly rent and food, let alone all that. And I traveled all around the country, many times by myself, by car/train/foot or thumb.   Point being, not everyone has the same experiences. It seems to be the cartoon of people in their 20s that you are more angry at. Sure, some are like that, but this doesn't mean everyone in their 20s hasn't experienced anything worthwhile or tragic. It doesn't mean that they can't be receptive.   There is a difference once you reach your 30s, your brain changes, the way you think, the decisions you make. But this would have never evolved without lessons learned earlier, and you wouldn't change at all if you were completely lacking self awareness. I've seen many older folk who still had the emotional wisdom of an immature child. It really depends on the person.",

What good is it to be able to engineer any practical or abstract concept when you are a flake with no wisdom, or a hot head with no perseverance - who will most likely burn out by the age of 30 - and end up a depressed and insecure mess for the rest of his life? Assuming he doesn't commit suicide. A wise man measures his success by the accumulation of both wealth and life (Money and Age/health). Being smart is not about how adept you are at staying trendy, this is what happens when a generation never grows up past High School. Being smart is about maximizing benefit, minimizing risks, and having the foresight to spend your youth building your life, and your knowledge, so that you can enjoy it in your old age; and then pass on your wisdom and skills to the younger generation so that indeed they would be smarter than you when you were their age, since you are giving them a head start with your own experience.",

But recently we found that the work they put in is worth half what someone 5 or 10 years older do. It is not simply related to experience, it is very related to the tech culture we have today. Kids spend so much time online they spend nothing on improving themselves. I see kids come and go at my job and many get fired for doing a pisspoor job. These are not dumb kids, but they lack certain social skills and handle certain tasks very poorly.\n\n20 years ago, we hired young people because they had more energy and were able to last longer. Now if you're 18-19 years old an apply for a job where I work, I will most likely throw that application in the trash. And this is something that alot of businesses experience.

The effect was possibly due to greater prevalence of schooling, more varied diets with more essential nutrients,  improvements in sanitation and medicine leading to foetuses being able to devote less of their metabolic energy to fighting off disease and more to neurulation and brain development, and the fact that people move around a lot more during their lifetimes means there's a greater prevalence of heterotic offspring than back when travel was limited by the speed of a horse.",

I am 39 which would make me old by these standards.  ironically in other industries I might be considered on the younger side or average.  it's about the person.  some older people are flexible and adaptive and some are not.  some younger people have grit and respect for experience and some do not.  the commenters (of any age) who make broad sweeping generalization demonstrate their lack of intelligence and sophistication.  I would never hire them.  I look for all these qualities (eg intelligence, adaptiveness' experience, drive, respect) when hiring and of course no one has them all perfectly.  making decisions based on stereotypes is an awesome way to be less successful and make less money.  yes I know Google is successful.  they would be even better if they did not engage in ageism even if it may be that most of the best people will be younger.  fair enough.  but older employees should not fear being axed based on age.  let's not even get started on the effects that has on morale and productivity.  anyway, anyone who says older people are smarter is an idiot and the same applies to saying younger people are smarter.  not exactly scientific.  and zuckerberg is obviously smart in some ways.  but that doesn't prevent dumb things from exiting his mouth with some frequency.",

Here is a list of some of the world's most famous scientists and their age when i have found documented evidence for their proposal (prooving they could not have had it at any later age than they were then):\n1) Copernicus, the world is round, letter demonstrating he was no older than 30 when he had this idea.\n2) Newton, Calculus, 1666 aged 24. his work on gravity was also theorised at this time as well and this was used to proove it much later on in his life. The idea still came much earlier however.\n3) Michael Faraday, Magnetism and Electricity, 21, 30, 41 depending on which breakthrough you refer to.\n4) Charles Darwin, evolution, idea came to him during his visit to the galapagos island in 1833 making him 24 years old.\n5) louis pasteur, germ theory, published work in 1858 would make him 36 but the experiments and proof and whatnot would have meant he was considerably younger than that when he had the idea.\n6) Einstein, relativity, 4 papers revolutionised the world in 1900 making him only 21 years old.\n7) geoges lemaitre, the big bang theory, his published work was in 1927 making him aged 33.\n8) Alexander flemming, pennecilin, this one shouldnt be included because no intellect was actually used it was a lucky breakthrough with no intelligence, or thought either way. he was however 47\n9) James watson, 25, francis crick, 37 DNA. This one is tough to know exactly how much intelligence was watson and how much was crick.\n10) Neils Bohr, the atom, introduced in 1913 making him a maximum age of 28.\n\nNot alot of old people in this list. If 60 year olds really are the best, why is everyone so young? Infact the only ones you can safely say are really old are crick who you cant actually show had any real insight at all, and flemming who literally only is famous because of shear luck.

But it does take time to provide evidence, do necesary experiments, right papers, find other research to quote and become reasonably sure enough to actually publish a paper. No one just comes up with an idea and publishes it willy nilly, 4 months later, these things take time. It isnt unreasonable to think that for example geoges lemaitre who originally published his work on the big bang at 33 took 3 years preperation and refinement of his idea and hence his original inspiration was before the age of 30. 7 scientists out of 10 (not including flemming) were directly under the age of 30, and if we also count geoges lemaitre who as explained above was likely under 30 that moves up to 80% It most definately is a falsifialbe claim if 80% of the famouys scientists in history where between the ages of 40-70 then my claim would be demonsterably wrong. And you don't provide your own evidence you just dismiss my argument outright based on nothing but \"well this doesnt hold for computing\". Proove it. Proove it doesn't hold true for computing. And if you say \"i won't provide evidence\" one more time we are done because that is basically the same as saying \"you should beleive in this thing based purely on my own opinion with no evidence to back it up\"",

If you or the CEO said: \"Sometimes we lay off the older workers because some do not want to progress with their education and learned the new technology and concepts?\" more power to you and the CEO. Placing the blame on a group as a whole is ignorant on your part. It would be like me saying that more younger workers do not have the dedication or work ethic - which would be as ignorant as your statement on older employees. Your categorizing was ignorant at best; or was part of your agenda to prove your own self-worth. What you said did not make any sense, and I read it. You obvious think that people are stupid to not detect your biased opinion in your posts.
