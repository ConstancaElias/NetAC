        "postText": "Mum Nekeshia Bentley and daughter Nyemah are big fans of Nickelodeon\u2019s Nella the Princess Knight, a mixed race heroic character loved by children.', 'But Nekeshia was disappointed to learn that a pyjama set available at Matalan inspired by Nella depicted the princess as having much lighter skin.', 'The 29-year-old thought it was just a bit of a glitch when she saw first saw the top online but was shocked to learn that it was also whiter in store which, she felt was a sign of \u2018sub-conscious racism\u2019.', 'Nyemah five, who is particularly fond of Nella, also has a doll of her and was upset to see that it didn\u2019t match the one she saw on the pyjama top.', '\u2018It\u2019s either a massive mistake or a case of sub-conscious racism. Either way it is out of order,\u2019 Nekeshia told The Sun.', '\u2018My daughter loves Nella. She watches the show all the time and pretends to be Nella, trying to do the things she does. She is a good, strong role model.', '\u2018I\u2019ve no idea why Matalan whitened the character \u2014 they need to explain.', '\u2018I thought it may have been the way it looked on the website, but it was the same in the shop \u2014 she looked white.', '\u2018Both Nyemah and I are black British Caribbean. She has toys of all ethnicities but she gravitates towards toys that look like her.', '\u2018Nella\u2019s one of her favourites, so this is a real disappointment.\u2019', 'A spokesperson for Matalan told Metro.co.uk: \u2018We are really sorry to hear of this concern regarding the Nickelodeon character pyjama set.', '\u2018We are working closely with Nickelodeon and our supplier to address these concerns. Customer feedback is extremely important to us at Matalan and all feedback is taken seriously.\u2019', 'Nickelodeon created the character of Nella, who has a black dad and a white mum, last year to be more representative of what children look like nowadays.', 'A spokesperson from the Nickelodeon said: \u2018This product doesn\u2019t accurately represent Nella in the same way that millions of children see her on Nickelodeon screens worldwide.', '\u2018We believe there potentially was an issue somewhere in the manufacturing process, of which we are investigating.\u2019",

I highly doubt it.They are cheap clothes, so they can be sold in high quantity to people with all incomes, thus a cheaper print.If the mother is that bothered, fork out for official clothes.Also, the princess character appears to have straight hair, hardly authentic is it? But apparently that\u2019s okay?If she really worried about about misrepresentation she should have seen that too.",
