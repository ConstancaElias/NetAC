        "postText": "'Gillette\u2019s new advert, a short film titled We Believe: The Best Men Can Be, has divided opinion, as it addresses toxic masculinity and shows support for the #MeToo movement.',' 'While Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan branded the ad repulsive and some customers have vowed to boycott the brand, the ad has also been met with praise across social media.', 'The advert features news clips reporting on the #MeToo movement and displays cases of sexism in the workplace, bullying, sexual harassment and violence between boys.',' The voiceover questions: Is this the best a man can get?', 'A clip of actor Terry Crews also features, as he says: Men need to hold other men accountable.', 'The advert ends saying: Because the boys of today will be the men of tomorrow.', 'When Gillette shared the ad on Twitter they said: \u2018Boys will be boys\u2019? Isn\u2019t it time we stopped excusing bad behaviour? Re-think and take action by joining us at TheBestMenCanBe.', 'The advert has so far been watched over five million times on YouTube in 48 hours.', 'At the time of writing, it has 106k likes and 382k dislikes.', 'In the comments, viewers are divided, with many vowing to boycott the brand.', 'Stop with the men hating, one person wrote, as another replied: This upsets me.Not because everything in it is bad, but because it's based upon an assumption that the evils in the video are rooted in masculinity itself (and a traditional understanding of the nature of gender).', ' Never buying your products again, commented a third, as a fourth said: NEVER again will I use a Gillette product.', 'However, some quickly praised the advert.', One person wrote on Twitter: It's so so crazy to me that so many men are upset that a commercial is asking them to be a better person and stand up for others.Absolutely WILD.This is an amazing campaign.', 'If you feel personally attacked by an ad telling bad men to cut that s**t out, maybe you need to ask yourself why you feel that way dude, tweeted another.', 'Bernice King, daughter of Martin Luther King, wrote: This commercial isn\u2019t anti-male. It\u2019s pro-humanity.', 'Meanwhile, ITV host Piers Morgan made his views on the ad clear this morning.', 'He and Susanna Reid came to blows over the subject as it was clear the Good Morning Britainpresenters had very different views.', 'Piers said: What Gillette is now saying, everything we told you to be, men, for the last 30 years is evil.', ' Now you\u2019 re all evil people, you\u2019 re all toxic with your masculinity. ', ' The programme played the advert for viewers and Piers wasn\u2019 t done with his rant on the subject. ', ' He sarcastically added: Basically most men are pretty awful people.We\u2019 re overly masculine.Horrible little bullies, sexual harassers and we have to be saved from ourselves, we\u2019 re all dreadful people.'",

To generalise \"masculinity\" as \"bad behaviour\" is totally illogical and incorrect. Humanity needs masculinity, as it needs femininity. The word missing from this ad is \"respect\". Respecting others is not <b> gender </b>specific.  Disrespecting others is what causes the problems. When you attack masculinity, you also attack the good and necessary aspects of the male, the charged and focussed drive, the protective/defensive attributes, the support qualities. This ad has been politicised, which is bad.It misdirects, which is bad, and it demonises one<b>  gender</b>, which is bad.Feminise your warriors and you will regret big time.",
