        "postText": "The US President will visit the UK from June 3-6, to coincide with D-day commemorations. However, Mr Trump is unlikely to address Parliament, due to the Speaker\u2019s outspoken opposition to the President. Mr Bercow has already snubbed the Queen\u2019s invitation to attend a banquet held for Mr Trump and in 2017, after the offer of a state visit was first made by Theresa May, the Speaker said he would oppose the President addressing Parliament.', 'Mr Trump\u2019s full itinerary for the state visit is yet to be discussed by UK and US officials, but once agreed usual protocol dictates that Buckingham Palace should then request invitations for the US President to address both the House of Commons and the House of Lords.', 'But Government sources suggest that a request is unlikely to be made as it is anticipated that Mr Bercow would not grant the invitation, which could potentially embarrass the Queen, The Guardian reports.', 'Addresses have been made by Mr Trump\u2019s predecessors, including Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan.', 'In 2017, Mr Bercow told MP\u2019s that addressing Parliament was \u201can earned honour\u201d and explained that his opposition had been prompted by the Trump-proposed ban on visitors from Muslim countries.', 'He said: \u201cI feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons.\u201d', 'But Lord Fowler, the Lord Speaker opposed Mr Bercow\u2019s stance.', 'He said it was unacceptable to bar a longstanding UK ally from addressing Parliament.', 'Lord Flower told the Cambridge Union Society: \u201cI profoundly object to any attempt to ban the president when he is coming to Europe to mark the anniversary of the D-day landings when so many Americans were killed and wounded in defence of our freedom.', '\u201cIt also seems to me that if our role inside Westminster is to uphold the rights of backbenchers and their right to free speech, it would be ironic to apply a different standard to the elected president of the United States.', '\u201cIt is my view that we should not stifle views we may disagree with or shy away from lively debate.\u201d', 'Several leading MP\u2019s have already refused the Queen\u2019s invitation to the state banquet being held for the US President.', 'This includes Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Mr Bercow, Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable and SNP\u2019s Westminster leader Ian Blackford.",

There is less than 20% who are worth speaking to, the rest do not do what they were elected to do. 83% of them were elected on LEAVE manifesto's but of them most are going against that.  He puts his country first, our PM puts the EU first, backed by the MPs. ",

He does not speak for the UK and should be instructed to support the will of the house and extend the courtesy to the President of the United States of an address to the Houses of Parliament. If Bercow is allowed to prevail then this inadequate collection of politicians in Westminster need to be flushed out with the slops.",
