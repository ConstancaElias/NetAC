        "postText": " The following Dead End Hip Hop episode was recorded live at the 2016 A3C Festival & Conference. . . S/O to all of the fans who were able to make it out!. . In the mid to late 90s a war was waged in hip hop. One that took the lives of two of our most prominent icons. Today a new conflict is brewing. One between the old guard who struggles to defend the classic elements of the culture and the new generation who strives to create a new lane for themselves, many times, by shunning the standards that came before them. Is ageism a thing in hip hop? And if so\u2026whose side are you on?. . Moderator: Headkrack (Hot 107.9 & Dish Nation). . DEHH Crew: Beezy, Feefo, Ken, Myke C-Town. . Guests: Yoh (DJ Booth) & Jay Burritos (Runaway Jukebox). . Camera Man: Modest Media. . DEHH presents: Who the hell is Damone Tyrell?. http://itun.es/us/r0R2eb. .

The audience is way larger now and they are not all hip hop purists, the radio isn't designed for hip hop purists - its designed for people who dont care enough to choose their own music. They dont care enough to analyze and break down wordplay, they want to be entertained with uptempo beats and popular phrases that are easy to access. Let them have it. The main core of hip hop fans can still find, appreciate, and support dope artists so I don't really see an issue.",

            "commentText": "It seems that the actual complaint from Ken, Beezy, Myke & others in that <b> age </b>range (I'm 31 like Feefo) is that its not easy enough to find quality music through mainstream channels.  Sad to say that hip-hop doesn't live in the mainstream, which it never really did ... when you say that Public Enemy was mainstream, that's not necessarily that accurate.  They were one of the more popular groups of the small emerging culture, but Def Jam was an independent label run out of a dorm room, it just seemed major.  And the EPMD's & such came out on independent labels like Sleeping Bag Records & played on college radio. <b>  Black</b> radio even hated rap music.  You couldn't se<b> e Blac</b>k music on MTV at all until Michael Jackson's 2nd (Epic records) solo album if I remember correctly.  It was always a culture of digging.  But those of us who experienced music in the 90s got spoiled with Death Row, Bad Boy, No Limit, etc. breaking through as hip-hop took over MTV & mainstream culture.  You have to except that hip-hop is counter culture and belongs to the underground and don't put weight in the complex's and other platforms that don't represent the voice of the culture, and not look to them to elevate our artists and to have the same standards that we do.  The big problem is that after a certa<b> in a</b>ge, people stop digging for music due to responsibilities and a sort<b>  of </b>age barrier to technology.  Mid 30s & up aren't on boxden everyday looking for all the leaks, unless you're Kinge & you have to listen to every release lol or you're more of a DJ type.  So when people say its a youth driven culture, and the commercial (commerce) aspect focuses on that under 30 ... that's why, because older than that aren't making an effort to find music, and are less likely to look to buy new releases every week, unless you're a digger. ... In that respect, as a music maker, I've realized how many people do rely on traditional mainstream outlets to filter music for you, and have more of a desire to make the Regulates that everybody will experience, instead of having to spam people on social media and get ignored.  So I can see both arguments",

Then I go see a group like flatbush zombies at the same venue and the place is packed from wall to wall to the point where you can't move. Get the fuck outta here with that shit saying these other guys arn't poppin. Yoh is right, the machine gives you the illusion these guys are poppin and thats cus they have cheap viral fame... the artists that are actually selling out their merch, putting up numbers in sales, and selling out there shows are guys like joey, action bronson, mac miller, freddie gibbs, earl, danny brown, tde, flatbush, underachievers, and the list goes on and on. I go to these shows...the seemingly in the spotlight \"trash\" you guys say represents hip hop doesnt have nearly as much support when its time to show and prove. Not to knock migos or young thug cus I believe that music is great and its real hip hop as well. the fact of the matter is the artists that arn't around for a quick minute are the ones really representing hip hop and if you look at the amount of good content that comes out by the numbers, hip hops in the best place its ever been in. Yahty and uzi vert are <b> nothing </b>but a couple viral distractions, just like many before them.",

I agree with Myke, there can't be a balance if the mumble rappers are getting more hotter than the other artist that grind out by crafting their art. If all I hear on the radio is Lil Yatchty, then where's the balance? If all I see is Lil Uzi getting 20+ million views on YouTube, then where's the balance? Balance is when both spectrums of hip hop get their equal share of the pie. I'm 23, I'm part of the younger generation that's not seeing that balance Feefo keeps talking about. Not all 20 year olds rock to Lil Yatchty and Lil Uzi Vert. A lot of us do want artist like Killer Mike, Lupe, Kool Keith, MF Doom, and Aesop Rock getting their shine on the radio too!",

People who aren't that big or deep into the hip hop culture, will be geared to the mumble rap, big sean, drake future of today as compared to everything so we have to hold everybody accountable due to the fact that the mainstream today normally runs the hip hop narrative or what is considered hip hop for the rest of the world or society in America. You don't have these same problems in RnB or Rock because how the genres are known and assessed to everyone. Rap today normally is 80% negative, degrading, bad, uninspiring and uncreative other genres don't have this same problem of negativity or garbage running the narrative of perception of that genre as a whole.",

I don't remember whack rappers being in the forefront of hip hop while jay z , nas , and eminem sat in the back. I don't understand how anyone with rap knowledge can disagree. The very fact that people are arguing that \"bad music\" doesn't exist alone shows how terrible rap has gotten. Lil Yatchy , lil uzi vert, 21 savage , designer , future , young thug, etc. are at the forefront of hip hop, where else even back in 2013, you had kdot push a t (good) drake and more. People KNEW young thug and future were garbage but agreed there's a time and place for it. Now these <b> dumb </b>ass kids will argue that future and thug are actually great and pac reincarnated. These new rappers can't rap , admit they can't rap , say they don't take rap serious , disrespect hip hops history and culture , release the worst music to come out of the genre , don't even consider themselves rappers , yet y'all kids still vouch for them ? The fuck ? If someone can't ball , admits they can't ball, says they don't take balling serious , disrespects basketball , and says they don't consider themselves basketball players , are they still on the team ? Rap is dead , point blank period. A few clean spots doesn't make the pool not contaminated",

Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Big Sean and J Cole are the most popular rappers right now the same way that you named Jay Z, Nas and Em. One hit wonders and party rappers have always come and gone; the greats have always stuck around.\n\nLil Uzi, Lil Yachty and 21 Savage are nowhere near as famous as Drake, Cole, Sean or Kendrick and guess what.... THEY DON\"T HAVE TO BE. Just like MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice and 2 Live Crew didn't have to dethrone Jay, Nas and Em.\n\nIt's like my man said: the game hasn't changed, the pool just got bigger. There's always been kids that just want a catchy song who fizzle out in time and there's always been guys who want to be mentioned amongst legends who stick around.",

ASAP Rocky is always on the E Channel & other channels w/ mainstream exposure. So don't sit there & tell me hip-hop is in a bad space just because a few new guys are popular on Soundcloud.

What's different about these niggas that we haven't heard before? <b> NOTHING!</b> Yes, they can do them; I'm not saying they can't. But they're not even TRYING to and that's the problem.

They don't HAVE to like their music, but saying the shit they're saying about them is hella unnecessary and half of those motherfuckers never even heard a bar from the legends let alone a full song!

There will always be a Future or a Young Thug in Hip Hop. Rappers have been complaining about the state of hip hop since the 90s: Ice Cube - Turn Off The Radio, <b> Common </b>- I Used to love H.E.R, Wu-Tang Clan - Intro of the 2nd disc of Forever. There has always been a dissonance between what is perceived as aesthetically hip hop and what is portrayed in the mainstream media. This has not gotten worse, just we are starting to romanticise the 90s era, which is implicit of an<b>  age</b> gap in Hip Hop and exaggerate the lack of talent in present day hip hop. To Pimp A Butterfly, arguably the most political and lyrical album in the past decade was a massive commercial success, proof that artistry is still celebrated in this era and the \"industry machine\" can get behind a \"true emcee\". There will be people ignorant of the culture and the history of the music and this is a shame, but not exclusive to hip hop. Artists that fail to acknowledge the past, will ultimately have a short lived career, there are plenty of young artists that do acknowledge and also include the legends on their albums (Schoolboy Q, Danny Brown, ASAP Rocky., Earl Sweatshirt for example) If 90s era rappers want to remain relevant and educate the youth who are more harder to reach due to their need for instant gratification, they need to show love to artists they genuinely like.",

There are outstanding young artists out there putting out new sounds with substance but also respect the history of the culture. Kendrick, Nick Grant, Schoolboy Q, J Cole, Joey Badass quickly come to mind. This year you also had <b> Common,</b> Tribe and De La Soul release outstanding albums. You can't ask for much more as a hip hop fan. For a few years I thought the substance in the music was fading but 2016 was an especially strong year and gives me hope for the direction of the genre. One thing I do think that's severely lacking is hip hop groups. There's no more Outkast's, Wu's, Tribe's, there's a lot of crews which individual artists put out projects but not a total group effort. Kanye is an interesting artist because he  bridges the<b>  old</b> skool with the new skool. I think Drake is just ok, for the last two years a lot of his music sounds the same. With Nas, Prhyme and Freddie Gibbs w/Madlib hopefully dropping albums in the near future I do think hip hop is in a good space. There's something there for everyone.",

I mean you guys have been telling us for the past 3-4 years that XXL shouldn't be seen as hip hop's bible but that's literally what y'all made it in your deciding of what's hot right now. Forget Kendrick Lamar getting 11 Grammy nominations and J Cole being certified double platinum, and Rappers like Logic, Chance the rapper and Joey Bada$$ who are selling hundreds of thousands of records. Y'all let Uzi and Yachty put out a few records ad make a magazine cover and all of a sudden they're the biggest names in hip hop? Young thug sold 18,000 first week and the trap shit is running hip hop? I must say that I was truly disappointed in you guy's assessment of this topic.",

The truth is, the<b>  weird</b> creative artists have been getting a lot of shine over the past three or four years, but y'all are still looking at the radio as the official home of hip hop's representation, instead of equally considering the many movements in Hip Hop that have sprouted from the Internet and made noise to millions of rap fans that don't listen to the radio anyways. To you Kinge and Beezy, it seems like mainstream/big time hip hop artist = a popular artist that makes party/trap/mumble music that you don't like. \n\nI can't take yall's argument seriously when you don't mention Kendrick or any of the guy's I listed earlier as a big time artist in Hip Hop, but you can mention Trinidad James, and Bobby Shmurda, (I get that it went with your point of making 2 songs and blowing up, but that pertains to lyrical/creative artists too). You guys even tried to make a case for Soulja Boy being relevant and he hasn't been hot in half a decade. \n\nI'm still a big fan of you guys! Y'all just be tripping on this subject lol.",

Next, we didn't say the <b> weird </b>creative artists don't get shine. That wasn't even the point of this discussion. We do mention Kendrick but the point is when it comes to commercially successful artists (which is what we were talking about) the Kendricks are few and far between.

The rappers you guys are referring to haven't really been getting those looks. Lil Uzi and 21 Savage are just internet famous rappers who are selling out shows, got a XXL co-sign and getting a record or maybe two spun on the radio. You know who else blew up off the internet and got co-signs from XXL and sells out shows? The rappers I mentioned above (minus tyler for the freshman cover). The only difference is that the artists of substance/creativity are building stronger fanbases, building better legacies and selling more records. I don't see Lil Uzi or 21 Savage selling 130,000 records in the first week like Logic, man. \n\nI'll be more concise in my points next time, as I did listen to this review at work earlier so I wasn't fully into it. But I'll run it back though.\n\nSidenote: Lil Yachty I personally don't judge as a rapper because he's blown up for his singing, I haven't really heard hip rap too much.",

I guess you must've been hybernating for all of his live Untitled performances he's been getting critical acclaim for and causing controversy in mainstream media. Sure you would probably say 21 Savage who hasn't done anything close to what Kendrick or Chance or J Cole has done, is a biggest artist because you saw him on the XXL cover lol. People like you just like saying mainstream music is trash because it became cool to say it back when Wayne was hot. I'll admit it bro, I was one of them. But unlike y'all, I recognize change when I see it. Y'all are just saying the same cliche shit y'all been saying since the \"hip hop is dead\" era.",

And also Kendrick and Coles sales are one of the highest in rap rn the only ones bigger rn would be Kanye,Drake, and Future.

To get music that sounds different, you have to go searching online to get it, which a lot of people won't do or don't know how to do.  \nThe problem with hip hop radio is that party/braggadocios music does not <b> age </b>well. Listeners get older, they have other priorities and eventually they just can't relate. Love songs, breakup songs, living life to the fullest songs, etc. relates to a wider range of people.\nHip hop is not the only genre dealing with this problem when it comes to the radio, but it's probably the only genre that doesn't have as much diversity as other genres on the radio(as small as that diversity is).",

Even kdot is slacking. If there isn't a jump soon you can bet that rap will take a huge dive and lose even more credibility. \"Oh this basketball team isn't trash , you just have to look for the good players\" \n\"Oh this popcorn isn't burnt , you just have to look for the good kernels\"\nIf something was in good condition you wouldn't have to go out of your way to see the good condition. There's no reason why I need to go on YouTube in order to here some quality. I don't remember the blueprint or gods son having to be looked for. Every single song in a category sounds exactly the same , from trap to that new generic boom bap style conscious rappers keep using.

His albums are still solid. I'd say his features are much to be desired.\nYour examples are \"College Dropout\", \"<b> Black </b>Albums\", \"Speaker box\" and \"Marshall Mathers lp\". I'd respond with \"To Pimp A Butterfly\", \"12 for 12\", \"Tetsuo and Youth\", \"King Push\", \"I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside\" and \"Shyne Coldchain 2\". \nMusic goes through ebbs and flows. There are too many artist right now in every genre for anything to take a \"huge dive\". Rap has struggled with credibility since its inception. There's no point in wasting time worrying about that. Who cares if it doesn't receive credit. That doesn't connect to it's uprise or downfall.\nUsing a basketball team as an example is a stretch because the music pool is so large. It's more like \"Sports everywhere doesn't suck. Look at these teams and players over here.\"\nIn response to your comments about not having to search for music on Youtube or the internet in general because they used to be played on the radio - you kind of pointed out the problem right there: The Radio. \nRadio controls what the mass audience is hearing. The radio works in trends and that's all. The trend right now is mumble rap and people that want to get famous see how easy it is to do it.\nThe plus side is that the radio is basically Blockbuster and companies like Spotify are Netflix. It's slowly dying and being taken over by another medium. \nMy personal opinion is that there is still great music being made in all genres. It sucks that you have to look for it, but it's out there.",

Just because something comes out of your mouth , doesn't make it opinionated. That's just a poor ass excuse kids make because they have trouble articulating an argument. The only album you named that can even be mentioned in the same sentence is TPAB, and no , that CANT be argued. The problem is non rap fans who know <b> nothing\n</b>About rap pre 05 using the lowered standards of today as their bases , what you call great , is only great by today's standards , yet if all you know is today's standards , it'll result in weak material being overrated. Did you just try and compare IDLSIDGO to speakerboxx ? LMFAO what ? No, this shit isn't even funny anymore. You kids are taking away the weight of the classics and quality music by turning into a second grade basketball \"everyone's a winner\" atmosphere which is single handily ruining rap. And LMFAO again , that's like getting shot in your arm , and the doctor saying \"are you in pain\" and you responding \"even though my left arm is shot, the rest of my body isn't , so I'm fine\" no. The fact that you can't see why speakeboxx and most of the albums you named shouldn't even be said in the same sentence makes It clear that you don't know rap or its history. We used to have songs like Stan all the way to \"ride with me\" getting huge praise and attention , not one hip hop album that dropped today would be considered good in 03, and I love a lot of albums this year. Yes , rap is getting bad. I don't remember crunk music\nBeing in the forefront of rap with crunk artists disrespecting hip hop and calling themselves legends or saying they're better than past icons while\nEminem, nas , and jay z drop music online with almost<b>  zero</b> mainstream attention. No, no, and no. We weren't having this argument back in 2012-13, so anyone who tries to convince themselves their isn't a problem , is apart of the problem. Kdots features have been getting more and more lazy and I'm not expecting any new songs\nFrom him soon as his record label manager TOP is a dickhead and loves to\nHold back artists and let them work in cycles . You know how a certain type of\nCOD series has their games drop every other year ?<b>  (Blac</b>k ops , mw) that's similar to top dawg.\nWe have to go\nThrough 2-3 more artists before we can get back to kdot, and in a generation that constantly needs to be reminded that you exist , that's not an effective system",

So yeah, if it does come out of my mouth and it can't be factually proven as right or wrong, then it classifies as an opinion. \n\nYour belief that TPAB is the only only viable example I gave is your own opinion. I can't argue that, like you can't argue my belief that the other albums I mentioned are great to me.\nI didn't directly compare \"I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside\" to any album. My examples are what I believed are good albums right now. Again, personal opinion. \nIt's not about comparing one album to another and saying \"Oh, this album doesn't stack up to this one, so it sucks.\" That's just not how music works. It's like watching 2 different movies, one being a drama and the other a comedy, and thinking they are both great. I don't have to compare them to see which one is greater. \n\"You kids\"? It's easier to have a serious conversation when you're not patronizing the other person and talking down to them.\nI'm not sure where you got this idea that I believe that \"everyone is a winner\", but okay....??? \nAgain, you do realize that your beliefs are personal opinion and not fact. Speakerboxx could be considered horrible to someone who loves Illmatic. It's all personal opinion. \n\"Not one hip hop album dropped today\". So you're saying you've heard every hip hop album released this year and all of them are not as good as every album that supposedly came out in 03? Wow! \nBasically my personal opinion is that great and bad music is always being made no matter what. Back in the day, we got more variety being played on the radio and pushed to the streets. There wasn't a lack of bad music being made. It just wasn't heard as much as today. Nowadays great music is still being made. The difference is that the radio isn't playing more of a variety. It's whatever is trending. So that means music lovers have to search for better variety. \nIf you believe all music back in the day is great and all music now is bad, then that's you're personal opinion. I'm not going to continue to argue that. But I'd just say cast your net wider and you'll find some great artist that are making great music.",

Nor could the dj. The MC grabbed the crowds attention. Gradually that evolved into lyrics being key. That's what rapping is. Being lyrical does not mean being conscious. That's the standard you have given it. Lyricism can come in the form of contorted literary devices. Hip Hop is not Pop. Don't compare it to Pop or any other genre.

Yachty, Uzi and of course Desiigner ALL stole Future's unique sound. Desiigner even proudly admitted it and claimed he does that sound better than Future. He also said that we can't get mad at him for that! WTF?! First of all, copying someone's sound is <b> NOTHING </b>to be proud of. Second of all, it is 100% impossible to do a sound better than the originator of said sound; the originator will ALWAYS be the best of a certain sound. These fools are just making themselves look hella stupid trying to copy Future, and don't make the excuse that they were influenced by that shit because that's different. Big K.R.I.T. for example is heavily influenced by both UGK and Outkast, but NONE of his songs copy their classics like \"Diamonds & Wood\", \"Chonkyfire\" or the big hit that both of the legendary duos were on: \"International Players Anthem (I Choose You)\". You just hear an INFLUENCE and not an exact replica. And lastly, Desiigner said for us NOT to get mad at him for copying Future; why SHOULDN'T we?!",

That logic makes absolutely no sense. If that was the case, these \"<b> old </b>heads\" you're referring to wouldn't like Kendrick, Cole, Joey, Tyler, Chance, Hopsin, or Macklemore.

It's the cultural difference between 90s artists like jayo felony or gang start and current artists like Lil Yachty or 21 Savage that set them apart. Society is different compared to how it was in the 80s and 90s, if Tupac came out in 2013,  he wouldnt be popular in the mainstream line of things, but of course if Tupac dropped All Eyez on Me in 2013 it'd sound a whole lot different then it does now.",

Thats not their fault that they're popular. Its the kids that make that shit trendy and glorify it. I'm still in high school, I see these things first hand every day. Hip Hop Is the most talked about genre and its all because kids say, \"Oh, this is good,\" then everyone thinks it's good. All bc its the popular thing to do. I know kids that tell me \"Kodak this Kodak that,\" I tell them that I don't fuck with that, im more of a Kendrick, Badass, ScHoolboy, Mac, Cole fan (I could go on forever) when it comes to the new shit. And obviously I fuck with the gold era. And then they start spitting knowledge of the 90s at me. And it tells me that they aren't just fans of these shit rappers bc they want to be, its just the popular thing to do.",

So they are not exposed to the other side of hip hop (unfortunately).\nSo the people think \"if i want to be cool i'll listen to kodak and love it\" when maybe if they listened to something else they could love it even more.

I dont think people have the <b> mental </b>ability to process the art of lyricism anymore. The reason this music is hot is because people are straight up getting stupid. I've had the opportunity to explain the art to many of my friends and they either don't care, or they will just tell me that they don't want to think that much when they listen to music. Its unfortunate. But yeah i see your point and theres definitely more than a few factors that go into what makes this music popular in today's time. Its a tough argument to have as we could just see because what hip hop is now is so developed that to just go back to how it was would be longer than pushing forward to something new. We don't need the<b>  old</b> ideas to replace the new. We need new ideas to replace the new. That goes with anything in life. Whether it's technology, science, music, government.",

You gotta understand that most of these rappers get famous from SoundCloud or YouTube only reason why rappers like lil uzi vert and lil yachty are popular it's because of there fan base another reason why people like them is because they have a different sound from everybody else and there original I wish guys like Bones, Xavier Wulf would as popular them even though they have a really big fan base there music is way different from lil uzi vert and lil yachty at least they can rap better then them lil uzi vert can be more lyrical if he goes back to his <b> old </b>style.",

If it doesn't make you feel good when listening, or have you making faces at how stupid it is...why do that to yourself? We do have this generations Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, Kool G Rap, LL Cool J, Big Pun, Pac...if somebody just looks. Why put the good ones in with the bad, to make a point?

Desiigner literally only had 1 other song when Panda dropped. There's a difference between 2 Albums and 1 song.

Your comparison is a fairly poor one.",

Never ever ever has anyone made a universally acclaimed Hip Hop track, with shitty lyrics. You say you know hip hop, but you don't because you don't understand that Sampling is different from Lyricism. That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard. Likewise, plenty of Hip Hop producers from the 90s could produce a track from Scratch. Those you listed do also sample. Boi-1da samples like <b> crazy,</b> he interpolates shit into his tracks as well.

You must not actually listen to the people i mentioned, there's compression and sound experimentation, especially when you're talking about 808s, bass sounds, synth design and tweaking today, and 90% of it is made from scratch, i have the utmost respect for anybody that makes beats from scratch, I'm not saying I don't like sampling, but i hold people who can create their own work to a higher standard, because they don't need to other people's music in order to create",

Therefore it took a lot more creativity and talent back then. The fact you think that sampling is something that you do when you cant play music is ridiculous, Go listen to a bomb squad beat, there is literally hundreds of sounds in 1 track. The producers you mentioned are lucky to even use 3 layers.",
