        "postText": "Leading Muslim groups have condemned Spectator columnist Rod Liddle for \u2018blatant Islamophobia and racism\u2019 after he suggested planning elections for a time when Muslims cannot vote.', 'In an article headlined \u2018If you do one thing this election, stop your kids voting\u2019, Mr Liddle wrote: \u2018My own choice of election date would be a day when universities are closed and Muslims are forbidden to do anything on pain of hell, or something.', '\u2018There must be at least one day like that in the Muslim calendar, surely? That would deliver at least 40 seats to the Tories, I reckon.\u2019', 'Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who is of Muslim heritage, said Mr Liddle\u2019s words were \u2018not funny and not acceptable\u2019.', 'He Tweeted: \u2018Not clear if the Rod Liddle comment is supposed to be a joke \u2013 but it\u2019s not funny and not acceptable.', '\u2018No community in our country should be put down that way.\u2019', 'Wes Streeting MP who is Co-Chair of the APPG on British Muslims said Mr Liddle\u2019s comments were \u2018blatantly Islamophobic and the Spectator should be ashamed of publishing them.\u2019', 'He told Metro.co.uk: \u2018The comments made by Rod Liddle in the Spectator are truly reprehensible.', '\u2018British Muslims are part and parcel of our democracy like all other groups. Minority communities\u2019 right to vote should not be attacked by preachers of hate but celebrated, promoted and encouraged.', '\u2018British Muslim communities in the UK won\u2019t stand alone against such attacks. There will be many others, including me, who will stand up to defend their rights.', '\u2018Mr Liddle and The Spectator should apologise immediately.\u2019', 'The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) accused Mr Liddle of \u2018denying Muslims their democratic rights\u2019 and of \u2018discrimination against Muslims\u2019.', 'An MCB spokesperson said: \u2018Mr Liddle\u2019s hate is not new and is in fact the usual bigotry that Muslims have become accustomed to.', '\u2018Here he calls for the discrimination against Muslims and a denial of their democratic rights, particularly when the far-right are on the rise.', '\u2018Outlets such as the Spectator regularly give racists a platform to share their anti-Muslim propaganda and feed into far-right narratives that thrive on Islamophobia.\u2019', 'Meanwhile the Spectator\u2019s assistant editor Isabel Hardman also said she \u2018profoundly disagrees\u2019 with Mr Liddle\u2019s piece and was \u2018hugely upset\u2019 by it.', 'Another section in Mr Liddle\u2019s column appeared to mock Labour MP Rosie Duffield, who last month spoke out about a previous abusive relationship she had while discussing the Domestic Abuse Bill.', 'Mr Liddle described Ms Duffield as \u2018the sobbing and oppressed Rosie \u2018#MeToo\u2019 Duffield\u2019.', 'In response Ms Hardman said: \u2018I know personally how strong and brave survivors of domestic abuse are and Rosie Duffield is one of the finest among us.\u2019', 'Anti-Racism campaigner Shaista Aziz said: \u2018To minimise the experiences of courageous Rosie Duffield MP, who spoke about her painful experiences of cohesive control and domestic abuse and to then go on to target Muslims is exactly the type of bigotry and disgrace Rod Liddle has become known for and paid very well to produce.', '\u2018A few days into a general election campaign and it\u2019s already open season for islamophobic and sexist views to be given prominence.\u2019', 'Rehana Faisal, founder and chair of Lantern, a charity that seeks to increase social and political representation among Muslim women said: \u2018Rod Liddle\u2019s words are deeply misogynistic, racist and Islamophobic.', '\u2018Whilst as a nation we value free speech, we must recognise that he is peddling a narrative of hate that seeks to strip Muslim citizens of their basic rights. Liddle is advocating for discrimination in a very direct sense.', '\u2018This dehumanising language has a direct impact on the physical and mental well-being of my community.\u2019', 'In response Mr Liddle said: \u2018There was no hate speech or Islamophobia whatsoever.', '\u2018It was a very light-hearted series of suggestions about when to hold an election, based upon the dispute over the proposed dates for the election.', '\u2018It was patently a joke. I do not really think that students should be drugged, or sent to a rave on an election day. Nor do I think that the vote should be held on a day when Muslim people can\u2019t vote.', '\u2018They were very obviously ludicrous suggestions, satirical in manner, about how to reduce the Labour vote by targeting groups which traditionally vote Labour and occasioned by the wrangling over whether the election should be on December 9 or 12.\u2019",

This is the same exact thing Hitler did to the Jews in the 1930s!So stop trying to hide the hatred behind oh it\u2019s criticism of Islam when it\u2019s actually hatemongering and fear mongering hence Islamophobia!",
