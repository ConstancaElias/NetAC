        "postText": "A row broke out on BBC\u2019s Question Time debating how racist Britain is.', 'As spoken word artist George the Poet spoke about his own experience of racism in the UK, a white audience member cut in to say \u2018Britain is one of the least racist countries in Europe\u2019 to which a Muslim woman retorted; \u2018You\u2019re a white man, how are you going to experience racism?\u2019', 'Looking at the problem clinically by citing statistics over the top of someone else shows how non people of colour (POC) negate and deny people\u2019s lived experiences of racism.', 'Stats do suggest that Britain is less racist than countries such as Italy and Poland, but that on average the country still has negative views of blackness. Those same stats found that no country in Europe has positive or even neutral views of blackness on average \u2013 that\u2019s nothing to be proud of.', 'There are statistics that prove the opposite of the gentleman\u2019s claim \u2013 as well as myriad accounts detailing Britain\u2019s problem with racism \u2013 that show the country still has a long way to go.', 'Not everyone reports their experiences with hate crimes so the reality may be much worse than statistics show. We need to admit that racism and xenophobia still plague our nation.', 'The very claim that Britain is the least racist country in Europe shows that the bar for what we consider to be a progressive, anti-racist country is too low.', 'According to the Migration Observatory, British people admit to prescribing to an ethnic hierarchy when it comes to people migrating to the UK.', 'Brits prefer white, English-speaking, Europeans and those from Christian countries while the least preferred are non-whites, non-Europeans and those from Muslim countries, (37% said no Nigerians should be allowed).', 'To people of colour like myself, racism is alive and kicking on multiple levels (institutional racism, unconscious bias, islamaphobia, the gender pay gap for women of colour) so to hear that Britain is the least racist shows how little regard is paid to our experiences.', 'And if on a scale to least to most racist, Britain \u2013 a historically notorious country for its colonial racism if anything \u2013 edges towards least, it must mean that other countries are more overtly racist, but also that actual instances of oppression in the UK are glossed over and brushed under the carpet, perhaps because it makes people feel uncomfortable.', 'By the audience member\u2019s logic, it seems Britain should be awarded for ignoring and silencing these people\u2019s experiences.', 'Britain might not have obvious dramaticised instances of bigotry like France, Denmark, and Belgium who enforce burka bans and police Muslim women\u2019s clothing, but it still has a long way to go if it wants to be the most progressive out of the bunch.', 'I remember the first time I heard someone say Britain is a highly racist country \u2013 I vehemently opposed it because it felt like a personal attack on a country that I love, a country that boasts so many opportunities and achievements such as a strong education system and free healthcare.', 'To admit its racial (and class) problem is not to deny Britain of all the good it\u2019s done, even for minorities \u2013 if there weren\u2019t opportunities, we wouldn\u2019t be able to thrive as we are. It\u2019s not to discredit the people who continue to be allies to the oppressed.', 'But to deny someone\u2019s lived experience of oppression is reductive, tone-deaf, and rude.', 'I shouldn\u2019t need to prove how much I love the country to be able to critique it \u2013 Britain has a problem with race. It\u2019s okay to talk about it.', 'Michael Mumisa, a Cambridge-based academic, told Metro.co.uk that the topic of race feels so uncomfortable because it goes against the very British concept of politeness.', '\u2018The reason we delude ourselves into believing that Britain is the least racist country in Europe is simply because it is considered bad manners in Britain to be racist without being polite.', '\u2018Statistics are of interest to people who hardly experience racism. Racism, like misogyny, homophobia and anti-Semitism are daily lived experiences for millions of people, many of whom do not even bother reporting their experiences because they know that as far as the establishment is concerned, the UK is the least racist country in the world.', '\u2018Racism is also about how people from minority ethnic groups are treated by the criminal justice system, employers, landlords, state schools (as most parents of black boys know too well), social services, and other institutions.', '\u2018These cases do not make in into the statistics that apologists for racism like to throw around.\u2019', 'Activist Sarah Vero told Metro.co.uk it\u2019s a hard truth for white people to admit because they don\u2019t grow up noticing race (which isn\u2019t a choice for people of colour \u2013 even the term puts us in a box).', '\u2018It\u2019s difficult for white people to see the ways whiteness is elevated all around us in culture and advertising and the subtle racism it causes in our society in all sorts of ways,\u2019 she said.', '\u2018It\u2019s like a fish swimming in water, it\u2019s everywhere and it\u2019s what we were raised on. In Britain ideas of fair play, equality and being a good person are highly prized and when people talk about racism it can feel like that vision of ourselves or our country is being challenged,', '\u2018So the response can be very defensive. I hope this video helps demonstrate a microcosm of how we are failing to listen on race. Since I\u2019ve started encouraging more people to read about race a few white people have said thanks for opening it up as they were too scared to get involved in case they got something wrong.', '\u2018If we are too scared or too defensive we can\u2019t engage and make progress. The first step to making a change is finding a way to be honest about where we are now.', '\u2018I encourage and invite white people to think about how you interact with race, whether you have explored it, talked about it, read about it and listened to people from different races talking about it.\u2019', 'I don\u2019t want to write a list of every incidence of British racism, citing the attacks on the likes of Stephen Lawrence to Abdi Ali, it\u2019s not the job of people of colour to break down racism so people will believe it exists.', 'Those speaking of their experiences \u2013 listen to them, even when it feels uncomfortable.', 'And remember, these are not personal attacks.', 'To be an ally, read up on race, be respectful, ask questions to those willing to answer, be self-aware, not self-congratulatory, and do the work.', 'Rather than speaking over someone\u2019s experience to declare that Britain isn\u2019t racist, listen to them. They have something to say that you need to hear.",
