    "commentText": "There are so many people in the comments here who don't realize people in their mid to late 30s are actually just the oldest Millennials. lol We've been infantilized for so long that people think Millennials are still teenagers when that's actually Gen-Z. There's been several times since I turned 30 that I've had younger people respond to my dissenting opinion with nothing but \"You're 3__\" (whatever specific age I am at the time), as though that's a valid response to negate everything I just said, even when the topic was how pointless it is to be toxic to strangers (which you'd think life benefits of how you act would be something an older person would be qualified to speak on out of life experience alone). It's idiotic and only tells me the person isn't worth conversing with anyway, and the same goes for anybody who pounces on physical appearance instead of substance. It's like... okay? Go ahead and act that way towards me, you're only making yourself look stupid without me actually having to engage you. Thanks for saving my time for me?",

I've seen it be used against dozens of people, including politicians that focus on others instead of themselves. It's a logical fallacy that you have to call out to hopefully break. When I mean hopefully, I mean that you have to show to the audience that just because someone acts/talks in this way does not mean that whatever points or thoughts they tell are valid. The same is for perfect, flawless looking people. Just because they are skinny and sound as suave as a slick blade does not mean they have well constructed or valid points. Watch the words, not the speaker.",

But more to do with people who have no moral or ethical values because their parents taught them to hate the world.

Unfortunately, this is what happens when you have a system where there's virtually no rules of engagement, people will crap on each other. \n\nIt also doesn't matter what one's opinion is, hateful humans will always find a reason to preach more hate, its all they know. Just last night I expressed my opinion for the issues surrounding firearms in the U.S, and one response was literally laced with profanity and threats. \n\nWhat I don't understand is why Google is so adamant on demonetizing the most harmless of content, yet they allow harassing and threatening users to flourish.

He shouldn't care about idiots saying dumb things, age is completely irrelevant with regard to knowledge, insight and intelligence, somebody who is smart and knowledgeable learns more when he gets older. I would say that Rick Beato has gotten smarter after years of buying too many Apple products when those weren't good enough. I am not sure if you understand it, those who thumb up such dumb comments - same as with your health problem - do this because they have a low self-esteem, they want to jump on somebody else to be distracted from their own problems. The same for people who make those comments.\nHaving said that, I hope that you take care of yourself with regard to your health.",

I have been building and using PC for over quarter century now. Suffice it to say, I have seen a lot of things in the PC. The thing that what bothers me most about PC is not because of console peasantry quotes that are floating around. Those are minor misinformation's which can be quickly debunk. What bothers me is the open platform that we enjoy slowly becoming like closed platform. For instance the sheer exclusivity of one gaming API, Direct X. Back in the day, we had multiple API that people used. This gave us more option beyond Microsoft platform. Also how Nvidia is pushing proprietary technologies with bogus \"certification\" fee. Along with how Intel implemented hardware level DRM to access key features which was available to us openly before. And I haven't got into digital distributions is transitioning to exclusivity deals. When I mention this to younger people, they don't understand how  much it can pose danger to open platform because most of them grew into this business model.",

If any argument was full of holes, it's pretending being younger, dumber and less experienced gives someone the endge over someone who has been living it for in a lot of cases 3x, 4x longer. this, by definition, is what you call \"Expertise.\" Look it up, kiddos.",

I have never really considered someone \"elderly\" other than name only until they reach a point where there is intervention needed in helping them care for themselves b/c of age. Even then, people they're not \"old,\" they are people just like everyone else. Ageism is stupid, I've never understood it, maybe it's b/c I was raised to respect everyone. Food for thought if you're a parent. Teach your kids to be respectful, b/c you will need them to respect you when you're \"old.\"",

And so back in the day, it would make sense to some what discriminate against people who were older than you. And on the weight issue it just leans on the idea that fat people are fat because they are irresponsible in life, which is why they are now fat. And somehow that means they don't have as much credibility as someone who is thinner. I can see where both arguments come from, but they are both flawed. Especially the age based one, since seeing someone around 30 who plays games isn't as uncommon as it was 10-20 years ago. I'm only 26, and im sure im gonna be that 35 year old guy whos kids tell him he just doesn't get it. Or that im old and fat. Not fat right now, but life's full of surprises.",

I'd like to think that in the long run demanding quality will benefit everyone. \n\nBrand loyalty is ridiculous and it's okay not to blindly like everything a company does. With this all or nothing approach consumers just shoot themselves in the foot, and I'm thankful that people like Rich remind us of that every once in a while with a critical look at these issues.",

So if any tech doesn't cater correctly for me, or is not intuitive to use, then my opinion is NOT invalid because of my age!\nSo here is a 'Life Hack' that I have learnt from all those years of life experience:  Whenever I am in a debate with someone and the other person is proved wrong, the correct response is to graciously acknowledge that, just as I would. Or agree to disagree and move on. However, if the other party realising they are in the wrong starts to use personal insults and abuse...  I immediately lick my forefinger, chalk up a huge check mark and say 'ding' for the win! Because as soon as they realise their logic no longer applies and resort to insults and abuse in a desperately pathetic attempt to justify their groundless position in the argument - That is the most blatant psychological signal to use, in admission of having lost and run up a huge white flag in defeat!",

I'm not advocating removing them from their positions, just fighting for educating them about their misconceptions around things that they don't understand because it was never a part of their generation.\n\nA prime example is the legislation surrounding net neutrality being proposed seemingly every few months, with a large amount of older people not understanding that things like SOPA would kill the internet as we know it forever, not to mention affect countries other than the USA negatively.\n\nI hope this post clears up the misunderstanding between us, but if you have any further comments I'd be glad to have a further more in depth conversation with you at any time.",

I haven't seen any indication that AsianMammoth believes this to be true. I swear you, unlike Rich, are looking for something to complain about when he had a point. Not every single thing needs a disclaimer, explanation, etc. when they are straight-forward jokes that anyone can figure out are nothing more than that. If they do, I don't know what is more true, that we are growing dumber as a species and seeking social justice that goes beyond acceptable actions or that I have some super intelligence that allows me to use what to me is common sense to figure out the purpose of things which completely changes how they should be viewed. I don't see why if you understand the purpose of this is different from what Rich is complaining about you try to say that it is the same exact thing when it isn't. Have some faith in humanity to understand that this is different before you make me lose what little I have left in you and other people. \n\nYes there are some idiots in this world which is why this video exists in the first place but not everybody is like that and I don't see why you should be offended by good intentions to get someone to laugh and in a good mood. What social justice are you seeking? To ruin everyone's mood that reads this and the replies? How is that some sort of social justice? It just sounds like you want to ruin someone's day. I am tired of SJWs ruining things for good people with good intentions. I don't understand people anymore I swear.",

It sucks when you want to have an Adult conversation, and you're surrounded by children whom are older then you.  This is where I can see some iteration or frustration coming from Rich; Understandably so. The most you can do is try to ignore these immature comments and move on, the problem with this is that, well it does start to get to you and you have to let it out in some way. it feels better to let it out and it helps the mental state. Give consideration of the fact Rich does try to do his damnedest to provide proof and legitimacy to his subjects.",
