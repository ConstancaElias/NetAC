        "postText": "The Daily Mail ran a story today which showcased a variety of men, all mourning for the fact that they can\u2019t find a \u2018good\u2019 woman.', 'These men aren\u2019t trolls. They\u2019re not offensive to look at and they don\u2019t seem like bad romantic prospects. Actually, they\u2019re decent looking, solvent, perfectly normal seeming men. But they\u2019re all happy to claim, publicly, that they\u2019re swearing off women because they\u2019ve been unable to find someone bearable to go out with.', 'Of course the natural response to these blokes is to take the p*ss. They\u2019re making sad faces into the camera and lamenting the fact that women want to get drunk or have sex. There is something faintly ridiculous about their complaints, and I fully understand why Twitter is full of people laughing at them.', 'But perhaps instead of laughing at these men (or maybe as well as\u2026) we should address the true reasons that these men are struggling to find someone to love.', 'Spoiler alert: it\u2019s their own fault.', 'While they\u2019re all keen to make the point that they have female friends (is \u2018I\u2019m not sexist, I have female friends\u2019 the new \u2018I\u2019m not racist, I have black friends\u2019?) the men in the Mail\u2019s article display something called benevolent sexism.', 'It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t like women. They do like them. But they don\u2019t see them as equals. If you\u2019re dating a woman in 2017, especially a woman who is single in her 40s or 50s, she going to have her own life, her own patterns and her own ideals.', 'Lots of women, for instance, like sex. They might even make the first move. This doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s a Jezebel who should be sent to live in a home for fallen women. You\u2019re not obliged to have sex with her (of course) but please, don\u2019t act like a proposition is akin to telling you she\u2019s got a third boob.', 'She won\u2019t need your protection, so you need to leave your White Knight complex at home.', 'Probably the most jaw-dropping quote of the article is where one man complains that he can\u2019t respect a woman who wants to get drunk or wear revealing clothes.', 'Women get to choose what they wear, what they drink, where they go and what they do. It\u2019s their life and their choice. If you think that a person\u2019s merit lies in what they choose to clothe themselves in, you\u2019re being extremely short-sighted and judgemental.', 'The world has moved on. I can entirely understand how a man who had been out of the dating game for decades might be shocked by how the liberation of women has changed their behaviours. We often go to public houses unaccompanied these days, and some young ladies are even venturing outside without their hats and gloves.', 'To be serious, if a woman\u2019s behaviour is offending you, try questioning why. If she\u2019s doing something that you wouldn\u2019t find offensive from a male friend, what does that tell you?', 'Also, we don\u2019t need you to walk on the outside of the pavement, pull a chair out for us or run around to open the car door. It\u2019s sweet, but not in any way essential. If you want to do that stuff, try checking with a woman whether she\u2019s okay with it. \u2018I know you\u2019re perfectly capable, but I\u2019d like to\u2019 goes a long way.', 'Dating is hard. You\u2019re auditioning for a place in someone\u2019s life, and rejection is frightening. Which is exactly why some men get defensive on a date. Being afraid that someone you quite like will knock you back can lead to problems.', 'Difficult as it is, try to open up and relax. A woman is not going to reject you for fun or for her own sick gratification. Don\u2019t assume the worst, or go into it with the preconception that she\u2019s going to rip you off and stomp on your heart.', 'Women are not witches. If she turns you down, it\u2019s not because she\u2019s a bad person or a con artist, it\u2019s just because she didn\u2019t click with you. Chalk it up to experience and move on.', 'No one wants to hear this, but here it is. Some people have unrealistic expectations. Men often accuse women of this fault, but let he who is without sin cast the first stone and all that.', 'If you\u2019re a single guy who hasn\u2019t been able to find a partner, there is probably a reason for that. Maybe you\u2019re shy, maybe you\u2019re busy, maybe you pick the wrong women. Or maybe you\u2019re in denial about who is and isn\u2019t in your league.', 'We\u2019d all like to date someone who is stunningly attractive, successful, funny, interesting and charismatic. Not everyone can.', 'If you\u2019re only interested in dating conventionally attractive women who are independently successful with a home-maker streak and a decent amount younger than you, then you need to ask exactly what it is you\u2019re bringing to the party.', 'Men who really want to meet a woman to spend the rest of their life with might want to think about widening their perimeters or upping their own game. You don\u2019t get to insist that your other half looks like a Victoria Secret model if you\u2019re balding with a paunch.', 'It might not be your fault. You might not be a low-level sexist who thinks women are decorative and sweet and gets annoyed when they want sex. In which case, it\u2019s probably just bad luck.', 'People of both genders can be dicks. There are trash men in the world, and trash women. Sadly, dating seems to bring those people out of the woodwork.', 'You could try a few different dating apps, and maybe even capitulate to your friends who want to send you on a blind date with that really great divorce they know, and if worst comes to the worst, you could always get a dog.",
