        "postText": "'Mr Trump will not ride up The Mall to Buckingham Palace with Her Majesty as security officials have warned it would be a nightmare to police, The Times reported. The US leader will instead be welcomed by the Queen at the palace, avoiding any demonstrations. London\u2019s Metropolitan Police is gearing up for a major operation ahead of the Republican\u2019s arrival tomorrow for his state visit.', 'Widespread protests are expected after Mr Trump\u2019s trip last July prompted thousands to take to the streets.', 'Several groups plan to march through London during the three-day visit.', 'Demonstrators are set to fly a balloon depicting Mr Trump as a baby once again and a 16ft talking robot of Mr Trump sitting on a gold toilet is also expected to make an appearance.', 'Supporters of Human Rights charity Amnesty will unveil five giant banners from Vauxhall Bridge facing the US embassy, saying Resist sexism, Resist racism, Resist hate, Resist cruelty and Resist Trump.', 'A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: A very experienced command team is preparing the multi-faceted policing and security operation for the president\u2019s visit and whilst the Met has a responsibility to ensure the right to lawful protest this needs to be balanced with the complex requirements of this policing plan.', 'Sarah Elliott, chair of Republicans Overseas UK, criticised the planned protests.', 'Ms Elliot said: The Trump balloon is just a campaign stunt for left-wing progressives to get attention.', 'I think the protesters are forgetting the reason for the occasion, which is to remember and recognise the special relationship that was forged during the D-Day landings and the liberation of Europe 75 years ago.', 'It\u2019s an incredibly important time for the British, as Brexit is being reset, to consider a free trading arrangement with the world\u2019s largest economy and their closest ally.', 'Mr Trump 's busy schedule includes a state banquet, tea with Prince Charles and Camilla at Clarence House, talks with Prime Minister Theresa May and an event in Portsmouth to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day.'",
