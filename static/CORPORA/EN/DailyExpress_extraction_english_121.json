        "postText": "The Labour leader faced criticism since last week\u2019s Panorama programme, which claimed that senior figures, including Mr Corbyn\u2019s communications chief Seumas Milne and general secretary Jennie Formby, had interfered in anti-Semitism investigations. Labour has denied the claims and written a complaint to the BBC. But Lord Harris of Haringey, chairman of the Labour Peers Group, has since said that Mr Corbyn was \u201cnot cut out\u201d to be a party leader.', 'Now Labour\u2019s governing body has been urged to support a motion which would automatically exclude members where there is \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d pointing towards racism and other forms of discrimination.', 'Mr Watson, the party\u2019s deputy leader, was among five members of the National Executive Committee who submitted the motion to the chair of the NEC.', 'The proposed change, which will be debated at a meeting next Tuesday, calls on the NEC to bring forward forward rule changes to the annual conference.', 'The motion demanding tougher action on antisemitism said: \u201cMembers who express racist, sexist, homophobic or transphobic views have no place in the Labour Party.', '\u201cWe need radical change and fresh thinking in our disciplinary rules to swiftly and fairly root out the evils of racism in our party and restore confidence in our processes.\u201d', 'The motion also calls on the executive to \u201cbring forward rules changes to this year\u2019s conference that: automatically excludes a member from the party where there is irrefutable evidence of racism, sexism, misogyny, homophobia or transphobia\u201d.', 'Meanwhile, more than 60 Labour peers have taken out a newspaper advertisement to accuse party leader Jeremy Corbyn of \u201cfailing the test of leadership\u201d amid the ongoing anti-Semitism row.', 'The full page advert, published in The Guardian on Wednesday, criticises Mr Corbyn for a \u201ctoxic culture you have allowed to divide our movement\u201d, saying it has prompted the resignation of \u201cthousands\u201d of members.', 'The party, it says, is no longer a \u201csafe place\u201d for its members and supporters.', 'The advert said: \u201dWe are saying you are accountable as Leader for allowing antisemitism to grow in our party and presiding over the most shaming period in Labour\u2019s history.\u201d', 'The advert is supported by a total of 67 Labour members of the House of Lords, including Peter Hain, Peter Mandelson and Robert Winston, and comes after a damning report by BBC\u2019s Panorama programme into the party\u2019s handling of allegations of anti-Semitism.', 'The peers also accuse Mr Corbyn of not having \u201copened (his) eyes\u201d or \u201caccepted responsibility\u201d for the row which has engulfed the party.', 'The advert said: \u201dWe can\u2019t be a credible alternative government that will bring the country together if we can\u2019t get our own house in order.', '\u201cYour failure to do the right thing will lead to the failure of the Labour Party being able to make our country a better place for the people and communities we seek to serve.', '\u201cYou have failed to defend our party\u2019s anti-racist values.', '\u201cYou have therefore failed the test of leadership.\u201d",

Given that BoJo is a shoe - in to the PM job - which he has clearly lusted for for many years - he will be in no mood to be bounced into an early GE and risk becoming the shortest tenure of any PM. I dont think he himself has any great talent, but he has shown as London Mayor that he knows how to build a winning team around him - he 's not in the least interested in micro-management. He will only call a GE when he is certain to win, not just when those little voices in his head tell him. He knows Our Nige is looking over his shoulder, breathing down his neck!",

We have \u00a310,000 and \u00a315,000 from Change UK founder Sir David Garrard in April this year and last Sept, a cool \u00a3500,000 in several payments from Max Mosley, \u00a345000 from Sir Trevor Chinn who represents the Jewish Leadership Council\u00a0and \u00a34500 from the Labour Friends of Israel. Garrard used to contribute to Labour during the Blair and Brown era but Corbyn's sympathy for the Palestinians is too much for him. Interestingly all these donations have been given under the cause of fighting the \"rife\" antisemitism of Corbyn's party and this is, I'm sure, absolutely<b>  nothing</b> to do with making sure Britain doesn't end up with a Prime Minister both overly sympathetic to Palestine and with the stated intention of wealth redistribution. Funny how commentators here are always banging on about interference in Britain 's democracy but when the opposition party are subject to quite blatant meddling they go along with it.",

Successive committees of enquiry have attributed this to a loss of competitiveness deriving both from poor production methods and laggardly innovation. An examination of innovation in ship design and construction and in marine propulsion highlights the declining British contribution in these fields. The conservative attitude adopted at various times by the Royal Navy together with restrictive arrangements in engine design and building seem to have been central in this. Additionally, few graduate engineers have been recruited either into management or into research, development, and design. For the future, a co-ordinated policy on research together with greater specialization in markets should be sought\".  You know when that was written? 1976, so don't go blaming all our failures on the EU.  Also all the EU countries building the warships we buy are subsidised by their governments and can offer their product at a competitive rate.Our gov chooses not to subsidise our own industry but to buy cheap from these countries.Despite EU rules we are able to use the competition get out clause that lets us build our own ships without having to offer out for tender if they 're essential for defense. Again we just buy another country's product.Again stop blaming the EU!!!",

But hey as long as the Banking and Financial Services thrives in London, our biggest Export, the rest of Britain can claim Benefits.",
