        "postText": " (7 Sep 2018) President Donald Trump is campaigning for Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who is seeking to unseat Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.. . Trump urged state Republicans to get behind Cramer's campaign during an event in Fargo. He says Cramer will help Republicans push for stronger borders and 'no crime' and help protect Medicare and Social Security.. . The president says Cramer will be the best choice for the state's Native American community and he's making a similar argument that he made to black voters in 2016.. . Trump says, 'What do you have to lose?'. . The president is appearing at events in North Dakota and South Dakota ahead of the November midterm elections.. . . .

The nwo needs more time to push their agenda therefore to look less suspicious instead of having 7 different presidents the US has had 4 in close to 30 years over if you include bush sr. all with the same agenda. Your opinion doesnt matter, the gears have been turning for centuries. My friend you dont have a clue whats going on and its quite sad because the history and information is right in your face. Yes Trump will win 2020 but thats not a good thing.",

The land that they fought for. Really you need to study the Choctaw people. You will see everything I said is true and that is my bloodline. I am a veteran as well. Tell me when did your people come over here and contribute to any war efforts. I can proudly say my bloodline sure has from the beginning of this country. I can show you proof written in history by white people so it must be true. So you maga,s want what your family never fought for. You talk about free stuff but I never got anything free.",

Did you know that reservation are the same as Puerto Rico, we are a domestic territory that is why we govern ourselves? Democrats specifically the Clinton only helped tribes that donated 6 figures to their campaign in the 90s I guess they forgot. The government has kept us dependent on them, not ourselves. Why aren't Natives on the rez protesting the tribal council? Which in my opinion is corrupted especially since tribes like mine are poor but our tribal council is rich. Only we can make a difference why depend on a government that has kept us down",

The<b>  age</b> of Aquarius, but good luck finding that on Google LOL. We read Fahrenheit 451 in middle school and now are living in the pre stages of that reality. Where thoughts are policed and truth is twisted to enforce the censorship of anything not state-produced or approved. I have been archiving historical texts and data for years now, ever since m<b> y senio</b>r year in High School. No bias to the historical texts or data, as I scrape sources from any database, library and niche shop that I can possibly find. I recommend we all become students of history, because it repeats. The most similar history I have found is Roman history and Babylonian history (when compared to the US, Russia and China). Fun fact: on the battlefields of the many Macedonian conquests on Persia, thousands of animals were sacrificed in mere months to win favor with the gods and goddesses. Imagine being in a Persian battle cavalry and seeing high priests slaughtering animals one after the other directly behind the enemy's battle line. To them it was probab<b> ly nothi</b>ng, but to us living in the current era it sounds insane. Maybe one day the future will look upon us in the same sense in the way we treat one another and the views we share with each other.\n\n I think my response was directed towards the statement that should Europeans live in the US. To that, I say that it should not be based strictly on moving here just to change the culture into European cultures. We have diversity in history to show what works, and what fails. Every system of power finds itself corrupted and failing, it just might take one longer to fail than the others. We can learn from this and implement  several key ideals from each long lasting system and create a better system, but people are so divided today that the only possible course of action would be outright force of power. Diplomacy died a long time ago. Now the only action that gets enacted by 'diplomacy' is with the threat of violence or threatening their economy. All love to everyone, I just dont want people to buy into a propaganda tool that we used on the USSR to collapse their power structure. Best wishes <3 \n\nPS I love intellectual conversations and absolutely admire different viewpoints. So a reply with your ideals would be greatly appreciated and respected. I just don't stand for blaming someone for something in history that they never had to deal with or has passed. I guess my message here was to remain privy to history but don't assume that someone now is the same as a person/group in history.",

My point is yeah we had our land taken and we take pride in the little land we have left, but reservations are poor especially ones with no casino or a little casino and bringing in more poor people into this country our poverty rate will go up there will be less jobs cost of living is constantly on rise. Tax in WA is 10.5 cents on the dollar imagine a 100,000+ ppl added to welfare tanf and food stamps means higher taxes again we need to fix the problems our country has. Also ppl don't realize Mexico only lets people in with money or a high education or benefits their country why would we let ppl in that doesn't benefit our country.",
