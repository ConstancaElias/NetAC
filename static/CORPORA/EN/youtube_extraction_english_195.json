If remain had won, I would have been disappointed but would accept the vote.  That's not saying I would not agitate to leave, but that comes from the ugly head we see being raised in Brussels after the vote.  I would think most <b> remainers </b>have accepted the mandate, and wish to get on with<b>  Brexit</b>, but many are exhausted from the constant dilution of leaving.  No doubt the government wish to capitalise on that, so we get the merry-go-round of the blame game - the first rule of politics, it seems.  I don't blame one side or another for any division in the UK, the fault can be laid squarely with those charged with implementing our will.",

Well as mentioned, the EU has eyes on it from people who weren't clued up about it before and assumed (like I did at the time) it was purely a trading bloc.\n\nI know people who voted remain because they were concerned about house prices, I know people who voted remain because they wanted to travel to Europe. I'm not kidding, they voted that way because they genuinely thought they wouldn't be able to enter Europe had we left. I even know someone who voted remain because they were concerned about the price of cheese...\n\nAnd they say the<b>  Brexit</b> Voters wer<b> e dum</b>b...\n\nAnyway, great vid and a great point you make about t<b> he agei</b>sm argument.
