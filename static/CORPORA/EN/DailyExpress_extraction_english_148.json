It\u2019s part of what makes it so special, that it\u2019s just ours. But we\u2019re happy. Personally, I love a great love story.', 'She revealed she doesn\u2019t read the extensive press coverage of their relationship, and hopes to not be affected by any public interest.', 'She said: I don\u2019t read any press. I haven\u2019t even read press for Suits.', 'The people who are close to me anchor me in knowing who I am. The rest is noise.'",
