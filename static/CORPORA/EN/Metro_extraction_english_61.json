        "postText": "Oh Boris, he\u2019s a clown, he\u2019s a joker, he\u2019s a laugh, what a harmless, funny, silly baffoon.', 'He may be posh but he\u2019s funny posh, he\u2019s just like us, he\u2019s a fun, funny chap.', 'Wouldn\u2019t it be funny to have him running our country?', 'No. It wouldn\u2019t. Over the course of his political career Boris Johnson has made it clear he is one of the very worst examples of elitist, boys\u2019 club-belonging, old school tie-wearing, far right Tory sexists.', 'And now it looks like he may become Prime Minister because he happened to back the right horse before the European referendum and is charismatic, popular and memorable.', 'I find this worrying. But don\u2019t take my word for why BJ as PM would be a bad idea.', 'Just read some of the things Boris Johnson himself has said about women.', '1. On why women go to university', '\u2018They\u2019ve got to find men to marry\u2019.', '2. On how female graduates are, supposedly, responsible for rising house prices', '\u2018The colossal expansion in the numbers of female graduates is in many ways a marvellous thing; but it has boosted the well-documented process of assortative mating, by which middle-class graduates marry middle-class graduates and thereby entrench their economic advantages, pooling their graduate incomes to push up house prices and increase the barriers to entry for the rest.\u2019', '3. On how female graduates who supposedly caused said rising house prices are responsible for other families finding it hard to get housing, and that women should work less and go back to the home because they are responsible for young people\u2019s antisocial behaviour', '\u2018The result is that in families on lower incomes the women have absolutely no choice but to work, often with adverse consequences for family life and society as a whole \u2013 in that unloved and undisciplined children are more likely to become hoodies, NEETS, and mug you on the street corner.\u2019', '4. On whether women should work', '\u2018Of course I am in favour of women working, and the world would be far nicer if women ran it, but I sometimes wonder if they \u2013 we \u2013 really want to work quite so hard.\u2019', '5. On how women in the workplace cry when criticised', '\u2018Men and women express emotion differently\u2026it should not be an offence to say that.\u2019', '6. On Tory tits', '\u2018Voting Tory will cause your wife to have bigger breasts and increase your chances of owning a BMW M3.\u2019', '7. On dedicated and accomplished Olympic athletes', '\u2018As I write these words there are semi-naked women playing beach volleyball in the middle of the Horse Guards Parade immortalised by Canaletto.', '\u2018They are glistening like wet otters and the water is splashing off the brims of the spectators\u2019 sou\u2019westers.\u2019', '8. On why people move to the city', '\u2018We seek cities because there are a greater range of girls at the bar, of reproductive choice.', '\u2018But above all, talented people seek cities for fame. They can\u2019t get famous in the f***ing village.\u2019', '9. On whether or not he was disrespectful and patronising towards female assembly members', '\u2018I have not been more robust towards female rather than male assembly members and I do not believe I have been remotely sexist.\u2019', '10. On inequality', '\u2018I don\u2019t believe that economic equality is possible; indeed some measure of inequality is essential for the spirit of envy and keeping up with the Joneses that is, like greed, a valuable spur to economic activity.\u2019', 'And one thing he said about his ambitions to become Prime Minister\u2026', '\u2018My chances of being PM are about as good as the chances of finding Elvis on Mars, or my being reincarnated as an olive.\u2019",
