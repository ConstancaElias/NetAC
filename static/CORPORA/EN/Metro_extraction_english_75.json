        "postText": "Donald Trump told a group of Democratic congresswomen to go back to the \u2018broken and crime infested places\u2019 from which they came.', 'This is despite the fact four of the women are American citizens and only one was born outside the US.', 'The POTUS has been slammed for his \u2018racist and disgusting\u2019 remarks and accused of wanting to \u2018make America white again\u2019.', 'Mr Trump was thought to have been referring to Democrat representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and her allies.', 'Others in her faction, known as \u2018the squad\u2019, are Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.', 'Earlier Trump had waded into a rift between between House Speaker and Democrat congresswoman Nancy Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez.', 'The liberal congresswoman accused the speaker of trying to marginalise women of colour for trying to limit her influence in recent days.', 'Mr Trump jumped to her defence when questioned by reporters in front of the White House.', 'He said: \u2018I think that, a group of people, is being very disrespectful to her, and you know what? I don\u2019t think that Nancy can let that go on.', '\u2018Cortez should treat Nancy Pelosi with respect, she should not be doing what she\u2019s doing.', '\u2018And I\u2019ll tell you something about Nancy Pelosi, that you know better than I do, she is not a racist. For them to call her a racist is a disgrace.\u2019', 'Today the President tweeted: \u2018So interesting to see \u201cProgressive\u201d Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run.', '\u2018Why don\u2019t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.', '\u2018These places need your help badly, you can\u2019t leave fast enough. I\u2019m sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!\u2019', 'Ms Pelosi distanced herself from the unsolicited defence and said Mr Trump wants to \u2018make America white again\u2019.', 'She said she rejected Mr Trump\u2019s \u2018xenophobic comments meant to divide our nation\u2019.', 'Republican and Trump critic Justin Amash of Michican, who recently took steps to leave his party, called the remarks \u2018racist and disgusting\u2019.', 'Ms Ocasio Cortez hit back at the President, tweeting: \u2018Mr. President, the country I \u201ccome from,\u201d & the country we all swear to, is the United States.', '\u2018But given how you\u2019ve destroyed our border with inhumane camps, all at a benefit to you & the corps who profit off them, you are absolutely right about the corruption laid at your feet.\u2019', '\u2018You are angry because you can\u2019t conceive of an America that includes us. You rely on a frightened America for your plunder.\u2019', 'Ms Omar added: \u2018As Members of Congress, the only country we swear an oath to is the United States.', '\u2018Which is why we are fighting to protect it from the worst, most corrupt and inept president we have ever seen.\u2019', 'Ocasio-Cortez, who is of Puerto Rican descent, was born in the Bronx, New York, and raised in suburban Westchester County.', 'Pressley, the first black woman elected to the House from Massachusetts, was born in Cincinnati.', 'Omar, the first Somali native elected to Congress and one of its first Muslim women, was born in Somalia but spent much of her childhood in a Kenyan refugee camp as civil war tore apart her home country.', 'She immigrated to the United States at 12 and taught herself English by watching American TV and eventually settled with her family in Minneapolis.', 'Tlaib was born in Detroit.",
