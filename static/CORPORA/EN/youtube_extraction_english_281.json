Those belonging to that section of the community come in many shapes and sizes, from the 'old money' aristocracy to the 'new money'  entrepreneurs, and each type has its own way of discrediting the Labour Party.\nThe Jewish way is to accuse it of anti-semitism . The proof is the desperate nature of all of these accusations. And it's a crying shame that the Party doesn't stand up to these thugs and bullies. Rejecting Ken Livingstone was one of the most disgraceful and shameful acts of hypocrisy and cowardice it has been my privilege to witness in 50 years of observation. Absolutely disgusting !",

And what on earth has it to do with Corbyn? Where is the link between Corbyn and the anti-semitism of his party members? Where is the why? Why did it start after his election and not before? Please answer me that because for 8:43 minutes you have not made one valid point against this party, just throwing assumptions. Sorry for the language, but I do not give a fuck about the party members interviewed or a guy thinking about committing suicid, I want FACTS here.

It's always details that all the politicians working for Israel should be jailed for treason and flung in jail for working for another government. Fuck zionisim and #freePalestine",

The very last words of the full documentary that Ware utters are to ask who will be the person to replace Corbyn as a leader in the wake of his clearly partisan attack on the current Labour leadership. They could've chosen anyone to make this programme but decided on a Sun journalist with a clear hate and disdain for Corbyn and his politics. Look at Ware's history and see he clearly has an agenda and an axe to grind. This isn't to say there's no problem in the labour party. It seems though more to be a hate for the history and present state of hard right-wing government in Israel rather than the Jewish people as a whole. There are clearly though some nasty fucks who need to be weeded out of the party. BBC top brass are terrified of change from a radical left Labour party. They're all paid a bucket load (men more than women) and don't want their pay packets to be taxed at a higher rate or those in their circle of wealth, privilege and power. The beeb does a lot of great stuff in music, drama, and documentaries but when it comes to radical left-wing politics the elite editors and producers are manning the barricades. Where is Panorama on Islamophobia in the Tory party?",

You have to admit, it's a fantastic smear campaign, the smear campaign on Corbyn will be celebrating its second birthday shortly and it's going strong. I frickin hate the Labour Party but WILL DEFINITELY VOTE FOR THEM NOW.",

What a revelation.  Thank goodness the BBC has opened the public eye.  Jewish people are hiding in cellars and avoiding going out at night, especially in places where Labour Party fascists congregate.  Many Jewish people are planning escape routes and some have bought inflatable rubber life boats to flee by sea if necessary.  The Labour Party crystal night is only a few months away, and the BBC warning to the public may be too late.  Some people find all this hard to believe, but that's probably because they are anti-Israel and don't know it.  The BBC will help root out the thought criminals - Hate Week will be extended indefinitely.",

In light of having no hard evidence the program resorts to menacing music and narrator bias. Notice how at 0:53 the narrator places negative emphasis on \u2018surged' when referring to the increasing party membership under Corbyn. Having more members is a good thing right? Not according to this program. And we know why because these \u2018new' members broke the neoliberal blairite project and re-established the traditional labour party. This is what all this is about. Again: Shame on you BBC.",

I'm from minority as well, I used to be critical of Israeli regimes, the way poor children are treated in Gaza, but that issue should be dealt with separately. The Jewish people are small in numbers, they feel vulnerable, why can't the Labour party reassure them by rooting out anti-Semitics for once and for all. I educated myself by watching a TV channel called 'Yesterday', one of the worst crimes ever in history against Jews, we shouldn't forget that.",

Whereas <b> Shylock </b>said \"if you prick me, do I not bleed?\". If you read the play strongly you can see<b>  Shylock</b> has always been put down and the winners at the end seem pampered and self-righteous. Also he has the best imagination in the play. It's one of his breakthroughs in characterisation. \n Also you could argue criticising Dickens and Shakespeare too much is anachronistic. If that happened today it would be way more appropriate to criticise the author.\n Unlike the inappropriateness of this vague slur of 'institutional anti-semitism'.",

Basically the UK's Muslim population as increased and a lot of Muslims are now involved in the Labour Party. Many of these abuses against Jewish folks is coming from the Muslim communities. If you investigate abuses against Jewish folks in our colleges and Universities. You will find that the majority of the abusers are from a Muslim background. If you investigate abuses on twitter against Jewish folks. Once again, a lot of those abusers are likely to come from the Muslim community.\nA lot of these white labour party members, like Ken Livingston and others have aligned themselves with Muslims, and they are playing to the Muslim audience. This is the uncomfortable truth, no one wants to mention.",

Zionism is a political ideology and there fore it must be open to criticism. Unfortunately the people who control Israel also control the US and the UK . Zionist hide behind the Jewish faith so they can bring out the poor me Card. They pretend they was set up to protect the Jewish people when the fact is they was not. Orthodox Jews are just as much victims as the rest of us. Jews are not to blame for the problems in the world. Unfortunately the Zionists use real Jewish people as a human shield to take the blame for all of the wrongs  they are committing. The Zionist have 80% of the UK Lobby so it is no surprise we are drip fed all this anti Semitic garbage. The BBC Are <b> nothing </b>but criminals and no matter how much they try to re-write history, people around the world are waking up to the fact that they are a Zionist institution. Stop being fooled by all the Main stream media. They are bought and paid for just like our Politicians. They are all owned by the Banksters who owned everything else. Do your research. This is not a con theory, this is factual information. Wake up. Even the term Conspiracy theory was created back in the 60s by the CIA after they murdered there own President. This term was to be used to call anyone who questioned the official story, and anyone who asked questions, to make them seem<b>  crazy</b> and for the most part the people fell for it. It is far easier to fool someone than it is to convince them they have been fooled. I say again Wake up.",

IF you have a solid evidence than take him or her to court.\n\nAs the Tories are sinking ..it started to look like if someone or many are pushing the antisemitism case all over the party. ..which they suppose support and work for. It is infact affecting it.\n\nAntisemitism isn't acceptable nor the way the labour party is being attacked within and very much so from the outside\n\nThere are Jews and non Jews who aren't  Happy with  the way the Palestinians been treated by a good part of the Israelis. \n\nSo keep the Palestinians out of this subject the labour party is facing.\n\nIt was realy shocking to hear a Jewish politician using the f word with such a aggressive attitude. <b> Nothing </b>is done about this. What would've happened if that abuse was directed to the Jews in they party ??\n\nThis is a really crucial time for the UK and ALL IT'S PEOPLE  to save them from a life changing position for the worse and that is a no deal<b>  Brexit</b>.\n\nOne of the parties  who is trying to prevent a painful future for UK  of a no deal har<b> d Brexi</b>t Now that party is still under attacks from the outside and within. \n\nThe allegations of antisemitism should be dealt with at the same time the party should be respected and it s leader shouldn't be attacked for being showing concern for the Palestinians. He has lots of work to do including dealing wih the complaints he get about all sorts of things.\nJust like any other leader. \n\nIndirectly using the f. Word ....directed to the party foundation, it's people or leader....is totally out of order...That's how it looked like. This was during  the  no to antisemitism speech 2 days ago.\n\nGENERALLY talking there is no place f<b> or raci</b>sm of all sorts.",

Here's a guy who spent an entire life battling against <b> racism </b>and discrimination and now he's an anti-Semite; this is all beyond laughable at this point.  Of course what truly frightens them is that Corbyn is an articulate and powerful fighter against Zionism.  B/c Zionists have a lot (not total) of control over the Western corporate media it's obvious they're running a propaganda campaign against him.  \nFolks must start to read the independent scholars, journalists and intellectuals outside the corporate-militarist-Zionist consensus, people such as: Norman Finkelstein, James Petras, Finian Cunningham, Gilad Atzmon, Diana Johnstone, Stephen Lendmann, Paul Craig Roberts, Alison Weir and a few others I'm forgetting at the moment.",

Communism - Karl Marx - Marxism. And the some of the Jews have been active in both and are still - to this day! The other trope-in-making - \"left wing socialist Hitler\" is pure bullshit. Like Mussolini, Hitler assembled the corporations and the government into a fascist state. That is, 'right wing'. It was \"socialist\" is name only. There was<b>  nothing</b> leftist about it.

People are able to see that political motivations are behind what the media is telling us are acceptable and unacceptable forms of discrimination. When in fact everybody who isn't a politician or a media executive knows that discrimination is unacceptable in all forms. As such, clear bias undermines the legitimacy and strength of your political hit peice against Labour because you are so blatantly unconcerned with the discrimination practised by the governing conservative party. What you're concerned with is radical social and economic change and conversely, by broadcasting such unambiguous, erroneous spin, you are merely hastening such change because people are fed up with being fed such nauseating propaganda #jc4pm",

Clearly there is a tiny minority within the party who have anti Semitic views and as far as I am.aware when such views are publicly aired the perpetrators are dealt with efficiently. There are people who are strong supporters of Palestine in Labour and Labour and Corbyns enemies conflate this with being anti Israel and by default anti Semitic. Obviously anyone with a cursory bit of knowledge of the situation would realise that this is nonsense. You can criticise the atrocities perpetrated by the Israeli government towards the Palestinians without harbouring prejudice against Jews. I think for a party to be anti Semitic it's policies would need to be blatantly anti Semitic ie they advocate for policies which directly and specifically adversely target Jewish people on the basis of their being Jewish. As such, by my own definition, Labour is not an anti Semitic party. But the double standard when it comes to coverage of the islamaphobia problem with the conservatives bugs me.",

It did not have actual policies against against<b>  black</b> people, but it simply did not take them seriously as either victims or witnesses. \nIn Labour there has been a shift in the membership and the power base to a more left wing group that has a particular focus on (some might obsession with) the Israel and Palestine issue. It has a particular dislike of zionists and most Jewish people (the vast majority) would subscribe to the right to a Jewish homeland, even if many are disturbed by activities in the occupied territories. \nDue to this group's influence on the party's levers of power, comments and attitudes that would once have been challenged had been allowed to fester. \n\nLooking through the comments section here, I see plenty of evidence of anti-semitism. Lots of tropes, especially around Jewish control and influence in evidence. While I don't know that those spreading them are members, they are all of an agreement that the Labour Party does not have a problem and that Israel is a Bad Thing.",

The MacPherson report is a good example of how rascism and discrimination can be implicitly present as opposed to being explicitly stated. Im not saying that there are not elements associating themselves with the party, whether as members or merely as hard left conspirators, who do not harbour and actively push anti Semitic theories or cliches. However, as far as I am concerned, the labour party at its core, is about class struggle and tackling economic and social injustice. These goals are being addressed more directly by the leadership now than at any point in the parties history since Attlee. I can only speak for myself and from my own experiences with Labour when I say that that is why I support the party, tackling these issues..It is of huge dismay that anti semitism is clinging to the party that I support. But ultimately, all that can be done is address cases when they are brought forward, stamp it out when we see it in any setting, political or otherwise and concentrate on achieving the necessary electoral victories to revolutionise British society. I would not support the party if I truly believed it was anti Semitic as it goes against what I believe.",

I personally speaking do think that the mainstream media coverage of it all suggests that there is something of a plot to discredit Labour and Corbyn but that has <b> nothing </b>to do with whether or not the media is owned by certain demographics of people, Jewish or otherwise. I think it's because they(mainstream media companies)are powerful corporations who are comfortable paying less tax and maintaining the neo liberal status quo and Labour is going to change this along with many other aspects of the economy and society so naturally they will hurl anything at Corbyn to stop him. Antisemitism seems to be working effectively for them but before this they tried to paint him as a Czech spy, a<b>  terrorist</b> sympathizer, and most recently, they have tried to say he is too frail. They attack him because he can't be bought and sold like most politicians, so whilst I hope he will keep doing all he can to overcome the antisemitism issue, I commend him for fighting on for those who desperately need a Labour government in spite of all the flack and personal character attacks he has to endure.",

Surely this showed social injustice and a wealth divide. But no, the programme commentator instead said that this was anti-Semitic because the mural characters were given a big nose. Who on earth would have spotted that? It was done with spray cans for goodness sakes.",

He had no intention or interest of making a balanced programme, so with more material he would have just done the same thing, but probably slightly more convincingly. I implore you to check him out, his previous programmes show how he likes to spin a story.\nI found it hard to swallow that the ex-employees would outright lie, but they had been accused way before this was made, the same clique of people, of purposefully using their position of power on the disciplinary board to try to purge members supporting corbyn in the leadership <b> race.</b> Given the huge amount of resistance to Corbyn within the party, this is entirely plausible to me. When you then take that in context of this programme, clearly a propaganda piece about the man, using every opportunity to regurgitate footage of him sharing stages with controversial people, using dramatic music ffs.....it makes MORE sense, not less.\nHave you seen The Lobby, the documentary by Aljazeera? Apart from standing as an amazing piece of investigative journalism of its own right, one really key thing from that applies here: the definition of \"Anti-Semitism\". In that documentary, Joan Ryan showcases exactly what I suspect an awful lot of the \"Anti-Semitism\" being reported within the labour party constitutes: lies. She heard what she wanted to hear, she certainly filed a report on what she wanted to hear, and it's only because it was caught on camera that she had to leave and the \"anti-Semitic\"<b>  woman</b> whose comment caused distress, was let off. Quite rightly; you can see soooo clearly in that documentary th<b> e woma</b>n <b> is nothi</b>ng o<b> f a rac</b>ist or anti-Semite, and the false claims made there are exactly what is being reported here (IMO) and exactly what is a danger to all minorities: the purposeful wrong use of labels for political gain, meaning <b> true ra</b>cism is delegitimised. \n\nYou seem like a person willing to respond and hopefully investigate! Please check out \"the Lobby,\" if you haven't seen it, particularly that scene should be a real eye opener to anyone jumping on the \"labour is anti Semitic, full stop\" train - we're going down a very sli<b> ppery </b>slope. Also, take time to read up on that email which mr Ware decided to just change at his whim (I actually hope it ends in another libel case against him, maybe he'll stop being given airtime), and the man himself - he's made some good propaganda before. A shame because in his early career, he did some good investigative journalism! Cheers",

In 1933 German Zionists made a deal with the Nazis to transfer 60,000 German Jews and their assets to Palestine. Rather foolishly, present-day Zionists want everybody to believe these well-documented events never happened. They slander and libel anybody who says otherwise.\n\nThe current stink has more to do with  Blairite/pro-Israel Labour factions responding to the Al Jazeera documentary \"The Lobby,\" where Israeli meddling in UK politics is laid bare. Why Corbyn has not been more forceful in countering these insurrectionists is a mystery. Personally, I think he is just giving them enough rope to hang themselves, which, aided by bogus liberal media like the BBC and The Guardian, they seem more than happy to do.",

Now it is just clearly a propaganda machine - churning out the free market ideals and legitimising the slow destruction of morals, accountability, responsibility and the demonising of pretty much anybody who really stands a threat to the same little clique of mostly white men who pull the strings. Not worth checking in on anymore.\nIt's funny watching the \"storm out angry people\".....until you realise it's all about where you're sitting, all about perspective, ie that you're one of a small majority in a dark theatre, the film has ended, popcorn was burnt and spilled and you've been laughing at a tragic comedy for 10 years, mistaking real life for satire and doing <b> nothing </b>to make it better. Hopefully you can use the paper popcorn packet to wipe up your tears, because in a true shit show, you can count on there being no toilet paper in the bathroom.",

Can you think of any other examples where collaboration is not used in this sense, on either a positive or negative way? To describe someone as a<b>  Nazi</b> collaborator always has negative implications, and using the word in the context of Hiller's dealings with the Jews is particularly offensive as a result.",

The word collaboration or cooperation is ridiculous. They had no choice, it was either that or death. You might as well say they collaborated by digging there own graves or scrubbing the pavements.  The fact is the European Jews went anywhere they could to find refuge. The USA, Argentina, the U.K. It wasn't that they didn't want to go to Israel, but it was simply too difficult to get to and too difficult to make a living once they got there. I thought the point Livingstone might have been making was that  the State of Israel was the creation of the West in order to create a new colonial power in the Middle East, but I don't see what Hitlers motives were. Perhaps it was just a cosmetic exercise.",

While it shows you for what you are, it makes you much less effective.\nAnd if evidence in court all need to be video based, we hardly ever secure a conviction.

            "commentText": "There seems to be little new here and much that is open to accusations of hearsay.\n\nFor this to be an objective piece, plausibly making the case that Labour is 'institutionally' anti-Semitic, the documentary should reference more actual cases, delve into these in detail, and prove these have been mishandled. \n\nThe few cases that are cited are not thoroughly discussed and are often anecdotal (with insufficient detail and no \nright-to-reply). The Jackie Walker case is a good example - we have a young investigator relating the charges second-hand. \n\nWhy not be explicit about what Jackie Walker actually said and then interrogate the way the complaint was handled?\n\nAlso, some cases appear to have been resolved - Kaylor Bibi has actually been suspended. Other instances are admitted - Corbyn has apologised for the mural, says he did not know about Raed Salah, etc.\n\nIn short, much of the doccie is <b> old </b>news.\n\nAlso, there are many general statements, but<b>  nothing</b> statistical, regarding the proportion of proven complaints to membership figures. Labour cites anti-Semitism as constituting 0.06% of membership. That's low.\n\nTo make the 'institutional' claim stick, this needs to be disproved.\n\nAs to interference, the allegation is immediately undercut by what appears to be the serious misquoting of a key email by Seumas Milne.  [LINK] \n\nThis is so glaring that it invites suspicion.\n\nMuch of the rest is guilt-by-association, or by referencing a 'pattern' rather than specific cases.\n\nMore generally, it's important to remember that any disputes process cannot stand outside of U<b> K Commo</b>n Law.\n\nPeople are entitled to a presumption of innocence, and to a fair hearing, before being excluded or sanctioned. \n\nAnti-Semitism is notoriously hard to prove, precisely because what is, or is not, an anti-Semitic trope, and whether the person using that trope is doing so knowingly (in which case expulsion might be justified) or ignorantly, merely believing they are criticising Israel or Zionism (in which case a warning might be more appropriate) can be genuinely hard to determine.\n\nLook at Naz Shah's 2014 Facebook post (one of the original anti-Semitism cases) which satirically suggested Israel might be moved to the US. That post could easily be read as a political commentary about Israel, rather than<b>  a raci</b>st comment about Jews, who live in many different countries.\n\nDitto with Livingston's take on Zionism<b>  in N</b>azi Germany. He might be wrong about the history (although he seems to have a point) but this does not make him anti-Semitic, merely wrong.\n\nIn short, it's not that straightforward. \n\nThis ambiguity alone might explain why complaints take so long to deal with, and why a backlog might require extra capacity.\n\nAlso, freedom of speech is worth caring about. There can be little doubt, following Al Jazeera's The Lobby (featuring hidden cameras rather than John Ware's studied appearance of objectivity) that the Israeli state is making active attempts to undermine the international BDS movement, and actively promoting this agenda through surrogate groups in the UK and US.\n\nAn Israeli diplomat was removed from the London embassy when this was exposed.\n\nIn short, one has to be very careful with every complaint and ask where the accusation is emanating from. A little fine-grained analysis in this regard would have supported Panorama's claim to making a even-handed investigation, but it is lacking.\n\nFinally, much of the discussion here is around the meta-narrative - iow, what has Labour done ABOUT anti-Semitism. To make the charge stick that Labour is 'institutionally' anti-Semitic, the film-maker needs to examine the actual narratives \nthat are at the heart of the claim.\n\nUnfortunately, by not doing so, he has left himself open to accusations of bias - at best, fanning the flames of a moral panic; at worst, acting as an ideologue and propagandist for his class- and political commitments.",

Yet, the actions taken by the Israelis in the 1948 war, by kicking out tens of thousands of arabs from their home and literally taking over their properties is reprehensible at the very least. Today, if you go to the West Bank, there are checkpoints everywhere for palestinians. The roads are actually desgnated for Jews only while the palestinians have their own roads. Palestinians cant go to the hospital, school, work without passing through checkpoints. I think if you see apartheid south africa in the 70s and 80s you find too many similarities to ignore. (Ironically, Israel was one of the last countries to publicly support apartheid gov in south Africa which should be understood as at the very least as Israeli tacit approval of apartheid in SA",

Labour's antisemitism runs at 0.06% of the 540,000 strong membership. Many of the complaints by former staffers related to inaction and obfuscation under Iain McNicol's leadership of the NEC, under whom they worked. When he was voted off the NEC, many of them left and destroyed thousands of documents relating to complaints, while taking copies to release to the media, hampering the new NEC head Jennie Formby's and Labour's attempts to deal with them. Panorama didn't mention that. John Ware, who made the programme, is a renowned anti-Corbyn tabloid journalist with form. The BBC, The Guardian and their allies in the rightwing of Labour really want to undermine a Corbyn victory at a general election because they disagree with his socialist direction, and they're weaponising antisemitism to achieve that.",

Spare us the dramatic music and the maniacal pictures of Corbyn and Formby. \n\nShow us some actual instances of high level Party members expressing Anti-Semitic views or defending Anti-Semites. I have looked extensively and I cannot find in a single newspaper any such instances, despite the constant hyperbolic headlines. \n\nAs with any Party with a sizeable membership, there are undoubtedly Anti-Semitic individuals within Labour's ranks. There are likely more Anti-Semites in Labour than in any other of the large parties, due to its large Muslim base and Anti-Israel activists. This is a problem that is being dealt with. But to suggests that Labour is \u2018institutionally' Anti-Semitic, as you so uncritically do, is a disgrace to journalism.\n\nKeep putting out hack jobs like these and we'll have Mr. Watermelon Smiles himself as Prime Minister for 10 years.",

Highly anti-semitic.\n\nAnd liker some on the rest, the obsession with Israel is to the apparent exclusion of many other territorial disputes all round the world, including the Middle East.

Not only are you going to build upon an unproven narrative which has been built in a completely unbalanced way by the media, you are going to accuse Corbyn of effectively being someone who is deliberately and connivingly creating and peddling prejudiced conspiracy theories about Jews. Take the Chris Williamson debacle. He said labour were 'too apologetic about antisemitism'; this was deliberately misconstrued and misrepresented  by the media to mean that Labour should not apologise for anti-Semitism. However, that is not what he meant and was not all he ultimately said; he explicitly stated what he meant at the time. Williamson's point was that by being 'too apologetic', labour were inadvertently overstating the seriousness of antisemitism in their party, when in fact the Labour party members are less <b> racist </b>towards any group than most. Clearly, this is not antisemitic but it was portrayed that way. The focus about the issue of antisemitism has purely been on Labour. Their has been no statistical analysis of other groups to compare attitudes between them and Labour party members; the media has just built upon a predetermined belief. There are purely ideological motives to get rid of Corbyn because he does not fit in with the neoliberal system which dominates modern society in the UK. Basically, the media and politicians are coming out guns blazing to ensure that Corbyn doesn't get into power; they probably have achieved their goal by duping the majority of the people into believing this spiel.",

It's already been proven that just 0.06% of the Labour membership have been shown to be anti-semetic and while any amount is too much, it's not running rife as this propaganda would have you believe. It also seems to be saying that asking if someone is from Israel is anti-semetic? Which it's not. Also that disagreeing with the Israel government or supporting Palestine is somehow anti-semetic? Which again,  it's not. \n\nHow people can call Jeremy Corbyn anti-semetic need a good lesson in history. Look at his past 30 years of voting, to fight <b> racism </b>and anti-semetism. He fought and won to keep a Jewish cemetery open, when Margret Hodge wanted it closed!  \n\nIf he is a<b>  racist</b> / antisemite, you're telling me that for the past 30 years he's just been pretending?

Like when the conservative are in power is the BBC more slanted to their view point and vice-versa with the Liberal party? I'm from Canada and we have the CBC and I'd have to say, the CBC is usually slanted towards the liberal side. but that could also be because whenever the conservatives are in power they try to slash the CBC's budget. And the liberal side is usually the people who increase their budget.",

There was a big shake up in the hierarchy during the coalition years, and movement of some editors, which has meant that their is more conservative voices at the top. It does seem to have drifted right, but so too does the popular vote.\n\nThey are definitly pro-establishment/anti-poppulist on both sides, the enforced centrism meeting better with new labour/one <b> nation </b>tories, less so with the<b>  old</b> labour/thatcherites and even less with Greens/UKIP\n\nObviously the fact that they are still getting attacked on both sides, means that they are still managing their job quite well, but it certainly seems that the attacks on the left have become more solid - though admitedly the right wing parties have got better PR, so it could just be that they have less editorial and more verbtim reports.",

Anti-Semitism doesn't come into it at all. It's Israel's foreign policy that stinks. \n\nI don't give a fig what<b>  race</b> or creed or culture they are. If you invade Kuwait then the West will engage in a Gulf War and kick you out without fear of being called anti-muslim. The singular difference in this case is that the invader is Israel, and Israel is the only Jewish state, and the history of persecution of its people has the sympathy of the world. But this sympathy and the heightened sensitivity that surrounds this history is open to abuse. It is my view, and the view of many others, none of whom you could ever cal<b> l racis</b>t or anti-Semitic, that this abuse is happening and that any moral high ground that the Jewish people of Israel may have been granted by virtue of their regrettable historical persecution has been lost as a consequence of their own bullish actions. \n\nThat many Jews around the world support the Israeli regime is a political choice. I do not agree with that choice and I will argue against it. If you by consequence categorise me as therefore anti-Semitic I will cite your illogic as a perfect example of a false syllogism. Basically, you are wrong. Dead wrong. Fucking dead wrong, right? I'm not anti-Semitic, I'm anti-illogic.",

Israeli cruelty to the Palestinian people is widespread and well known in both countries. Hamas isn't even supported by the majority of Palestinians despite their suffering - 76% of Palestinians want a peaceful solution and Hamas to go away. Israel has no interest in a peaceful solution and is little more than an apartheid state that is trying to steal land from people who lived there for thousands of years before they got there. Its disgusting. The fact Israel is so powerful on the world stage means Palestine has no voice because of them in many areas and those who support Palestine tend to either be quiet about it or overly cautious about links with Israel (I think Corbyn is the latter fwiw). Basically free Palestine and fuck Israel.",

The refusal has pushed Labour to the brink of a civil war with its Jewish parliamentarians and members.\nBut what is the difference? And how did it take us to the point where\u00a0Jeremy Corbyn was branded 'antisemitic and a <b> racist'</b> to his faceby one of his own MPs?\n\nThe IHRA definition\n\nA total of 31 countries have adopted the IHRA definition of antisemitism, as well as more than 130 UK local councils, the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the judiciary. Eight of the 31 countries have enshrined it in law. The definition was an offshoot of one created in 2005 by the European Union's Monitoring Centre for<b>  Racism</b> an<b> d Xenophobi</b>a, then the EU's leading an<b> ti-raci</b>sm body. When EU directives changed the role of the agency, it no longer promoted the definition, and the IHRA stepped into the breach.\n\nWhat Labour left out when it chose its own version\n\nThe IHRA definition specifies eleven 'contemporary examples of antisemitism', while making it clear that there may be others.\nThese are:\n\n1. Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.\n\n2. Making mendacious, dehumanising, demonising, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective \u2014 such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.\n\n3. Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.\n\n4. Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust).\n\n5. Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.\n\n6. Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.\n\n7. Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel i<b> s a rac</b>ist endeavor.\n\n8. Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democr<b> atic na</b>tion.\n\n9. Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterise Israel or Israelis.\n\n10. Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.\n\n11. Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.",
