        "postText": "A teenage boy who was banned from performing his drag act at a school show will get a chance to showcase his talent on the big stage.', 'Lewis Bailey will perform his act \u2018Athena Heart\u2019 at DragWorld, Europe\u2019s largest celebration of drag, next month.', 'It marks a huge change in fortunes for the 14-year-old, whose school banned him from performing at a talent show \u2013 claiming his act is inappropriate.', 'Organisers got in touch with Lewis\u2019 family after reading of his rejection from Castle High School and Visual Arts College in Dudley, West Midlands.', 'Lewis said: \u2018I\u2019m very excited about my DragWorld invite to perform and get my name out there so others just like me know that it\u2019s ok to be different.\u2019', 'Nathan Stone, creative director, of MJR Group said: \u2018We are so excited to have Lewis and his family at our event. It is an absolute honour to showcase the great young talent.', '\u2018We don\u2019t believe anyone should be told they can\u2019t be who they want to be!\u2019', 'The convention takes place at Kensington\u2019s Olympia in London on August 18 and 19.', 'Lewis, who is gay, had been practicing his act \u2013 a medley of pop songs \u2013 for weeks ahead of the school show.', 'However, he was pulled out of lessons just a day before the event and told he would not be allowed to perform.', 'Lewis was inspired to perform by watching RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, and mum Natalie said the youngster\u2019s new hobby has helped him come out of his shell.', 'Michelle King, principal at Castle Academy, said: \u2018Castle is an inclusive school that celebrates diversity. With regard to the performance of our student Lewis Bailey at the end-of-term talent show; we made the decision that it was not age appropriate for either the learner and for the intended audience, his peer group, for Lewis to appear as a \u2018drag act\u2019.', '\u2018We understood Lewis wanted to appear in the style of Ru Paul, whose style of performance is characterised by strong language and sexual innuendo.', '\u2018This decision was made one day before the planned show, when the full nature of his performance was made known.', '\u2018We respect the long tradition of female impersonation in theatre, however to appear as a drag queen, goes beyond this.\u2019",
