        "postText": " I Never Finished Watching A Video This Long Before But This One Really Got Me !!. Group of people who was born in approximately 1994 and after are touch to manage and they're accused of being entitled and narcissistic self-interested, unfocused , lazy .. but entitled is a big one... . Indeed, comments by older adults that today's youth are more entitled than previous generations go back at least to the ancient Greeks. My read of the data is closer to the skeptical view: most such claims are more indicative of the griping of older adults than anything 'new' about today's teens. Sure, some teens feel entitled, but that's always been the case. But stories such as Rachel Canning's lawsuit fit into those narratives and provide more fuel for juvenoia. What should be a private family matter becomes fodder for the perennial intergenerational squabbling.. . Video from :Vine Survivor. http://www.note4me.com ",

And I know it's rude to ignore you so I say \"fine\". And I also know if I were to actually open up to you with sincerity about any issues I may have, since you asked, I start getting painted with broad terms like entitled, whiney, and emotionally stunted. So I'll give you a broad response. \"Fine\".\n\nAlso, shout out to all my brothers and sisters that were born between 1980 through 1994 that own their own business, raising their own families, and/or are serving in the military. Remember that you are of the millennial generation and you are exactly what is wrong with country.

But at least i know what a Baby boomer, Gen X, and Millennial are. Baby Boomers are mid 1940's through early 1960's. Gen X is mid 1960's through early 1980's. Gen X stops at like 1980. Millennial start at about 1981-1996. There's a lot of people out there who don't even know what generation they are. Say \"I'm a Gen X i was born in 1984\". No dumbass your a early Millennial. Or say \"I'm a Baby Boomer I was born in 1969\". Nope your a early Gen X. People should try to have some <b> common </b>sense and study what generation they are.",

I'm almost 29 and have just starting to being good at overcoming procrastination, lack of motivation, negativity, egocentricity and so on. It took me about 7 years to overcome the effects of my social background (friends and family I grew up with) and if there is one advice I can give you, guys, that would be: You will fail. And when you fail, remember why, forgive yourself, then try again. Good luck and get working on it because the world our parents left for us is going to hell in a hand basket. It's up to us to become the self-educated and self-sufficient people our society needs in order not to go completely socialist. \n\np.s. I know that last sentence might have been confusing but once you have overcome your classic millennial issues, you might want to get a basic understanding of how the states, eu and nato work, and how exactly everything is becoming a dystopia.",

            "commentText": "This guy is full of shit.  He knows absolutely <b> NOTHING </b>about Dopamine or basic human neurology.\n\nDopamine is not just a \"reward\" chemical.  It serves a MULTITUDE of purposes and without it in our brains, we'd become catatonic.  It expands blood vessels, and it even assists in RESISTING impulsive behaviors.  People with ADHD, unlike what this jackass is saying in some of his talks, are in part suffering from decreased dopamine activity, thus making it difficult to resist urges.  It's got<b>  nothing</b> to do with looking on your phone or being on social media, and saying it's a \"misdiagnosis\" is undermining the hundreds of thousands of professionals who've done more peer-reviewed research in one year of their lives than this asshole could even understand in a lifetime.\n\nYou know how else dopamine works?  In conjunction with a multitude of other neurochemicals.  You don't just get a \"dopamine rush\" when havin<b> g se</b>x, drinking, or eating, you're also getting adrenaline, endorphin,  opioids, and many others.  Hell, even in a reward process, Dopamine isn't responsible for making you feel good, it's responsible for releasing the chemicals, like opioids, that make you feel good.  In other words, Dopamine is not a simple scapegoat you can pin to the reason why the digit<b> al a</b>ge has people looking at their cell phones and engaging more prevalent through social media than in real life.  This is the argument of a pseudo-Luddite using pseudo-science and charm than actual information.\n\nThis man is attempting broad stroke the greatest problem the Millenial generation is facing through talking down to them about how much time they're spending on the internet, and not the litany of other issues that are plaguing our society as a whole.  Before that, we had parents saying that the damn death metal and satan was killing us all, and before that the damn hippies, and before that rock and roll.  He's a fraud, a liar, and he's getting away with it every time someone believes his shit.  Millenials know how to interact, and how to form deep, meaningful relationships.  They know how to appreciate a hard day's work, and they aren't some mysterious creature that can be explained by a single neurochemical.  They are people, they are individuals, <b> and noth</b>ing more. \n\nExternalizing these behaviors on something like Dopamine is a useless oversimplification.  Given that Simon is grouping this issue as a \"Millenial\" issue overlooks the fact that Millenial brains are largely unchanged from the generations before them, thus Dopamine works the exact same way as it would in a Baby Boomers brain than it would a Gen X brain, and all of them have been exposed to modern technology and communication, and therefore are not immune to the trappings he's merely making up.  It's about the individual.  There are reasons why someone attaches a value to a behavior like checking facebook every 2 minutes, and if it's truly a problem in their life that's keeping them from their own perceived success it needs to be examined on the individual level.  Before the dopamine comes a thought and a behavior, and that is all dependent on the individual and their life and outlook on it.\n\nIn short, this talk is all bullshit, and this man is shamelessly promoting himself using misinformation.",

The problem with millennials is that they want to continue to be babied and dont have motivation to do for themselves. MOST of these people cant even pay a college tuiton by themselves without mommy and daddy helping them out. Instead of working their asses off and taking 2 or maybe even 3 jobs to save up money, they're comfortable with mommy and daddy taking care of college, and paying their bills. Like i said, SOME of the blame goes on the parents but most of the blame goes on these millenials.  If these were my kids, i'd push them to do for themselves. They need to step up and do for themselves and learn to take responsibility  instead of being weak and entitlement little shits",

Tuition is too expense and students waste time and money taking classes that most likely they wont use once they get into the workforce. Going to a trade school is the best option.

All this \"free\" school you hear about are paid by tax payers. its nobodys responsibility to pay for someone elses education. The problem is that people like you are blinded by lefty media thinking that everything in life should be handed to you. The lefties dont encourage people how to be independent. they want them to be depended on government to take care of them.  People like you is whats wrong with this country. Entitlement little shits that think we should pay for everyone else. i love when people like you compare other countries to here. if you think things are better outside of the USA, then perhaps you should leave and go move to one of those countries.

People from other countries can't understand why college is so expensive here while they don't have to pay a dime where they are. And honestly why should tax payers be upset about funding the next generation? Is that not the point? To give the newer generations better opportunities than what we've had. \n\nAgain, no kid is going to be able to save up enough to get in to college without some kind of help. It's very disingenuous to say all you have to do is save and then you'll go to college. It is not that simple, not even close. Most businesses won't even higher people with anything less than a bachelor's degree and even then it depends on the school you received your degree from.\n\nThe irony in you calling younger generations soft is hilarious. You're literally here in a YouTube comment section ranting about how you don't like things a certain way and starts name calling and whinnying because of it. Here's some advice for you, if you don't like the way things are or the direction it's heading, then maybe you should take you're own advice and leave this country and let us know how that goes for you.",

But the majority of the people who think that way are millennials,. \n\n\n  once again, <b> nobody </b>should be forced to use their own hard earned pay check to pay for other people's education.  Its not my responsibility to fund other people's education. The only responsibility I have is helping my own kids. And even then, i've taught my kids to do for themselves and be independent. Bad parenting is one of the reasons millennials are coddled and feel entitled.   You need to get this entitlement mentality out of your head. I assume that you're an adult? So you should know that part of being an ADULT is learning how to stand on your own two feet. Not having other people paying your way of life. This is a huge part of the problem of why millennials refuse to do for themselves. Because of people like you that coddle them and not allowing them to do for themselves.  When you have a system that forces people to take  care of these kids, you dont motivate the kids to be self sufficient. Once again, once a person reaches adulthood, they are responsible for themselves. \n\n\n\nMany of the youths of today want to play \"adult\" when it comes to partying, drinking and having<b>  sex</b> with multiple people. But when it comes to the RESPONSIBILITY that comes after that, then they want help from others. These people  cant be an adult for some things and expect help on other things. It doesnt work that way.  If  they want to play the grown folks game then they need to take the grown folks responsibility and  consequences that comes along with it. Simple as that",

How is speaking on college expenses somehow relate to everything in life? You're taking a brush and painting a whole generation over one topic. We're talking about college. Which is a valid argument considering how bad student debt is nowadays. We're not talking about kids going out partying and drinking. And don't even try to use that as a way to shame kids because kids from all generations have done it. It's not just this generation, it's literally what teenagers do and have done for generations. \n\nYou're right, your main focus should be your kids. But your kids aren't going to be the only ones in this country when you're long gone. How are we supposed to thrive and advance as a country when we can't even look out for one another? Why the hell did I fight for this country if everyone is just going to look out for themselves? People here try and act so patriotic when they don't even know the meaning of it. No one is saying give them a hand out. They're saying make some changes.",

I park in the garage, so it's not like he assumed my car wasn't there, he saw there was a garage. He really thought the fact that I didn't answer his text meant I wasn't at the house. That's how much he relies on technology. When I asked him why he didn't ring the bell, he said 'Idk man, I'm not used to door bells lol'  That's why I only rent out to older folks.

You championed the civil rights movement but you always agreed with your boss and parents to their face, and were complete and utter 'yes' men. You were less educated, more provincial, and completely and utterly entitled. Yes. You are right. We do have a smartphone problem. It's totally true. But you guys would too if they were available. They just didn't exist back then. Also, you have to account for the fact that some millennials are just...young.

They are really not aware of reality and this fact will really affect the next generation and is always was and is the problem.  And the biggest problem is they know every rights of themselves but don't give a fuck about others (Iam an individual bs). They think everything is right but again they don't know a single thing about life and how life works. They can't stand a single good or real person, athlete, musician,etc and think they are fake. Thats reality of today's world, they are fake at finest or fake as fuck. Leave your comments below, please",

So if they do break a window, they understand why it's such a big deal. Mom was planning a family vacation, but now she has to replace a window. Most people scream, \"Mom should have went to college!\" Well she did, and that's why she's in debt now. Bc her parents didn't sit her down and explain the budget, they just told her, \"You better go to an impressive school, if you want to be someone impressive.\"",

On the contrary I wouldn't be surprised if this diatribe about the generation generally agreed to have been born between 1980 and 2000 (yes those are the years generally agreed upon for the millenials generation, look it up) contains more than a few pearls that might encourage introspection, deliberation, and even promote growth.\n\nThe problem is most of the \"proof\" and \"data\" presented is easily debated to the opposite, anecdotal, or of even lower quality as far as evidence goes. It relies on cognitive bias and is presented less as; \"everyone should give this some thought\" and more as <b> age </b<b> >old</b> rhetoric of \"kids these days\". Every generation twists it's hands and frets over the next. Be it helicopter moms or that supervisor at your first job that wouldn't shut up about how lazy and self entitled this new generation is.

As a late millennial myself I see that the cellphone and Facebook\ndiscussion is extremely pertinent. We grew up in a technology environment. The\ncomputer (AOL, chat rooms, email, etc) was a huge part of my upbringing. The\ncell phone wasn't readily available and widespread until I was a late teenager,\nbut as an adult today, I carry a cell phone wherever I go (and use it as my\nalarm clock!). However, blaming things on corporations and that it is the\ncorporation's responsibility to fix things is irrational. There is no way to\nchange an entire society's perception of their self-worth through actions the\nleadership needs to do for its employees. Doing so sets up an incorrect\nprecedence that individuals will then be able to find purpose in life (and\noverall increased satisfaction) through coming to work every day to put food on\nthe table and if they don't feel like they are making an adequate impact\nthrough their actions it is the corporation's leaderships' fault. It is just\nshifting the blame onto someone who has absolutely <b> nothing </b>to do with the\noriginal problem in the first place. Setting clear limits is something everyone\nshould be doing (whether at work or in their personal lives) but this type of\nvideo makes it seem like all millennials are some sort of cry baby, irrational,\nunappreciative, underprepared, ungrateful generation- and that is just not the\ncase. Millennials (especially younger ones) are a technology and instant\ngratification group of people- that I wholeheartedly agree with from the video.\nExcept, I don't see it as all negative. Our society will never revert to\nnon-use of technology. It has brought us medical and life-saving miracles, efficiency,\nwidespread dissemination of information (both good and bad) by the click of a\nbutton, the ability to acquire needs/wants within hours to days, etc. Things in\nthis world are changed forever, and if we think that putting cell phones away\nbefore and during a meeting will change the way people live (and have\nsatisfaction in) their lives then we are living in a fantasy world. We must be\ninnovators of how we can adapt the prior way of doing things to the ways of the\nfuture so that<b>  old</b>, current, and future generations can be productive and\nfulfilled members of society. Times indeed are changing, and we must work\ntogether intergenerationally to plant seeds of prosperity and wellbeing for all\ninstead of placing blame and shifting responsibility to areas that are\ninappropriate.",

There is one reason why the world, and our <b> nation,</b> is in the complete melt-down it is in, and that is because God, Jesus Christ our Saviour has been taken out of our Judeo-Christian-founded culture and way of life. It started in the 60s, with those in power planting drugs into our culture, especially into the<b>  black</b> neighborhoods to control them but it backfired, and through systematic, calculated worship of money and fame and 'talented entertainers, our generations have been ALLOWED to be raised to not believe in God, to be narcissistic and selfish, self-gratification presides over kindness to strangers and those in need. Ou<b> r natio</b>n is free because of military men and women and God Almighty blessing us -- not many join the military today and thanks to an anti-Christian muslim who has been ignorantly allowed to sit in our White House, our military has been decimated and turned into a satanic-profering club where ministers and clergy are not allowed to discuss God, have Bible studies, Bibles on their desks, share service<b> s, NOTHI</b>NG.  And this was all prophesied to happen.\nIt's all about feelings now, which are fleeting and subjective. It's all about \"ME! ME!\"\nMy parents' generation and not all of my generation did not turn <b> our nat</b>ion into what it has become today, a God-bashing, God-mocking, self-absorbed, entertain-me, what's-in-it-for-me, selfish, slovenly, disgusting idolization of the world and its products. That came from satan being allowed in and Jesus Christ our Lord being thrown out.  My generation had President Kennedy establishing the Peace Corps, of which hundreds of thousands of young people volunteered to go all over the world to help poverty-stricken people.  The generation since the 80s at large has their heads bent over texting while driving or walking and ignoring reality and embracing danger -- danger of losing their souls, their lives, many focused on simultaneous blaming older generations, God Almighty Himself and accumulating as much technology garbage as quickly as possible.<b> \nThe</b> old saying, \"If you think education is expensive, try ignorance\" is not only plausible, it is factual, it is a reality. Where and what are you learning, young people?\nBecause this all will pass away, disappear.  But Jesus's Words will never disappear.\nAnd time is running out.\nChoose wisely.  Choose Jesus Christ.  Help others.  Be kind.  We pray for all of you.",

I think this only furthers the sense of entitlement, to say more that once, \"it's not their fault\". When we become an adult, it is up to us to figure things out. Quit treating an entire generation like babies. That is part of the problem!! If you screw up, own up to it. If you aren't sure what to do or where to go next, join the dang club.

In America, A child reaches adulthood at 18 (legally), but in many other cultures much sooner.  Our society needs to stop elongating childhood and thinking of adults as children.  A child is not at fault for being raised a certain way.  However, at what <b> age </b>does a \"child\" actually become an \"adult?\"  It is not so clear in our society.  At what<b>  age</b> does a child pass into adulthood and claim responsibility for themselves and the situations of their life?   When is responsibility passed from the parents to the offspring? 18? 16? 13? 23?  People would say different things I think, but doesn't everyone agree that the mark of an adult is that they take responsibility for the circumstances surrounding their own life, actions, happiness, job, etc?  The truth is that in America, Millennials born before 1998 are ADULTS.  College students are ADULTS.  New graduates entering the job market are ADULTS.  It is not social media that is the problem, and it is certainly not a company's responsibility to teach an adult about communication (though any smart company will make this valuable investment in it's employees).  The truth is that each individual is responsible for themselves, for everything that they are, and for all of the circumstances that surround their lives.  People love to displace the blame.  They love to find reasons why an adult who is in a bad place in life is not responsible for themselves.  People blame their parents, significant others, politicians, the government, religion, science, social media, cell phones, technology<b> , alcoho</b>l, drug<b> s, ra</b><b> ce, gen</b>der, socioeconomic status, the illuminati, television, video games, fast food, the education system, the economy, the internet, other countries, God, Satan, liberals, conservatives, their boss, big business,...pretty much you name it and people will blame that thing for their problems.  The one thing that most adults won't admit is that their sucky life is their own goddamn fault.  The truth is, it is not all of these exterior things that are at fault.  It is just people.  People are at fault.  It is the responsibility of a person to find their own happiness and success.  And until an individual person looks at themselves and takes full responsibility for themselves in every way, that person will NEVER find happiness or reach their full potential.  Happiness can not be given to a person.  A person must claim it for themselves.  It must come from within.",

He even says that it's \"through no fault of their own\" 3 minutes in. The problem is that we, as a species, have created a truly toxic environment as a result of trying to sugar coat everything and over-protect kids. It's like an immune system: a person who grows up in an overly sterile, overprotected environment will be at greater risk later on, because their body simply doesn't know how to fight back against a disease. The environment you grow up in makes you who you are, and prepares you for life. If a child is brought up with certain ideals and being taught certain ways to be, and then the illusion is shattered once they're out in the real world, how on earth is it their fault that they don't know or understand how to cope?",

But no one ever said millennial started in the 90's. Even this guy should have <b> common </b>sense and know when a generation is. It's the world in general that's losing any<b>  common</b> sense. Hard work or employees don't matter anymore, rather than numbers and some random employee getting a promotion. You could be the best worker in your company and some mediocre employee could get a promotion instead of you. Some aspects of society is changing for the worse, and Gen X and Millennial aren't doing thing about it. Baby Boomers mostly run the government and they pass any law that comes there way. Trans need there own bathroom fine ok. The army can't yell anymore it's fine ok.  Ban the confederate flag government says ok. Baby Boomers Are mostly in charge of the government and they pass laws for any complaints. Then Gen X and Millennial are told they can constantly complain because it's perfectly fine. All three generations are at fault. Now there's Gen Z elementary though college who are completely involved in shitty social media. You know Facebook, YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, Instagram, kik, Snapchat. Everything that's making a person more of a shut in.",

But the problem is millennials blame EVERYTHING on the previous generations instead of taking responsibility.. I'm only going by what i have witnessed.
