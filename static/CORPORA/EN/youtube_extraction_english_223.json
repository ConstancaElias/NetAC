It's important for the future. Then they should establish another enclave on the coast within 10 miles. And then more enclaves between the enclaves......creating an informal trade route to the outside world. Russia would gladly trade. China would make deals. Even donatins and trade could be established with populaces within Europe, Canada, USA, Australia, NZ, and Argentina. MAKE BABIES!....and adopt the right babies! GROW THE POPULATION!",

In fact a <b> black </b>family came to live there and enjoyed it very much, but they left due to the culture, because at the end of the day its 2 different cultures. There  no shame in admitting that. It's an Afrikaans town, with afrikaans culture and norms. It's no different than a white person choosing to go live in Soweto for example, if the white person can't adapt to that particular culture, then he/she will more than likely leave, that does not make Soweto a \"Blacks only Town\"  - at the end you might like it, but you might want to live among people with the same culture. This notion that Orania is an apartheid town is complete hogwash. it's media hype. It's private property developed with it's own infrastructure for like minded people who embrace the Afrikaans culture. It's about culture, not skin colour. If you go live in a \"green eco vegan housing estate\" you are going to feel pretty excluded when you show up with your 5.7L V8 4x4 gas guzzling truck with bull horns on the radiator.  Dont know why people and journalists in particular don't understand this very basic concept.",

Orania maintains its own municipal administration, while Thembelihle provides no services (such as sewerage, roads, rubbish collection) to Orania, and collects no rates from the town (other taxes are paid normally).In 2011, town rates for residents were between R1,500 and 2,000 per month. The town's existence is permitted by the Constitution of South Africa under a clause that allows for the right to self-determination.Orania has a non-confrontational attitude towards <b> South Af</b>rican authorities, which have likewise adopted a non-interference policy towards Orania. The ANC government mostly avoids the issue of Orania and its status, as it is seen as less important than many other political issues the party faces. What is happening in France today with all the muslims?\u00a0\u00a0 Why don't the French assimilate with them?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why do people HAVE to Assimilate with others?\u00a0\u00a0 why force people to get along with others?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If they don't they do not have to! before reporting on Apartheid places like Orania.\u00a0\u00a0 Come to visit the place or SHut up if you only go on hearsay!",

Therefore blacks always embrace integration, miscegenation, etc... Whites, on the other hand, will tolerate blacks as long as the blacks know their place as an inferior subservie<b> nt ra</b>ce.\nAsk yourself honestly if you think you are better than Blacks. (Of course you do!) Then ask yourself how long the former system of aparthied and oppresion could have possibly lasted in this evolving world. Finally, ask yourself why these whites don't just go back to their country of origin if they can't stand blacks so much. Classic white entitlement. Lol.\nThe people of this town won't even teach their children about the love,  compassion, and perseverence of Madiba and other leaders (white <b> and bl</b>ack) who tried to heal the country. Times may be a bit rough for some whites now, but it is a drop in the ocean compared to suffering of the blacks, from whom <b> this Afr</b>ican land was stolen. \nI can't even imagine living in a country where I'm told that I'm a second class citizen just becaus<b> e I'm </b>black.

If he actually pulled his head out of his behind and did some homework he would understand why. You only need one look at the state of SA to understand why these people don't want to mix. Orania is heaven compared to the rest of the place. There is hardly a place in SA where you are safe as a white, <b> indian,</b><b>  coloured</b> o<b> r blac</b>k for that matter. The place is going to the dogs and the anc and those politically correct foreign government fools are to thank for that. Even for blacks SA was much better under apartheid, an uncomfortable truth, but swallow it whole, you pc bleeding hearts.",

If you're always going to be so hellbent on blaming one another for something that happened in the past you're never going to open your eyes and focus on the present. Like it or not, we all made mistakes-no matter who we are. It's about time we all start over TOGETHER and build everything the past has broken down up...remember, you may not be able to change the past, but it's up to us to determine the future...what are you going to do about that?",

I am not excluding such africans or Indians from the list of the people exploited,  but as a whole,  it was a massive scheme of the whites to rob the people of colour of their wealth. Apart from that,  you are forgetting the fact that there was a huge psychological damage done to these people by undermining their traditions,  their social systems,  their authority structures,  by imposing their systems.  I am not blaming the current day whites for what happened some years ago,  but there is a moral debt.  You have to be amongst the exploited to truly understand their sufferings.",

In every state in the unitedstates the population is below replacement it is a dire situation its sad when mexicans have caucasian on their birth certificate and they are looking confused saying there is<b>  nobody</b> white in my family. Now as i read your comments cause i love reading saucey comments i notice you like calling blacks names but blacks are reproducing lik<b> e craz</b>y. The reason i am telling you this with all the overdosing on opioids which is higher than what they say ,you would kinda think maybe being nasty to people of oth<b> er ethn</b>ic groups isnt really the best thing to be.

                    "commentText": "@Edit Fazekas Do your research. Whites for centuries have instituted barbaric means and attempted to dominate and control every region of the world. They have exercised control of most of the wealth and resources around the world and hoarded it for themselves, then want to blame every other <b> race </b>of people whom they've essentially subjugated and starved out for not building up the infrastructure in their own countries. It's like taking a mans arms, then criticizing him for not plowing his own crops. Ever heard of Mayer Amschel Rothschild? Do your research. He was a white man and he was extremely evil. He was the founder of a HUGE banking dynasty and his used his wealth to manipulate wars, and he forced other nations to make alliances with him using his power and influence, and he put the countries that he considered to be his enemies in debt. If he puts a country in debt, do you think it's citizens can build there? Do you think they can create infrastructure, stabilize their economy and thrive as a society? But you ignorant white people who think you're so smart never research and educate yourselves about much of anything. You just thought you were more superior, and that was the reason why other nations were never able to build lol. You whites weren't more intelligent. Your people were just selfish, vile, wicked, and evil. And to this day you believe lies of superiority rather than facts, which keeps you willfully ignorant and delusional to the truth of our history which has NEVER been hidden.",

Firstly the decline in birthrates of indigenous Europeans is their own choice based on many factors for examplethe cost of raising children and not something forced upon Europeans by non whites. Secondly you speak as if the current trajectory of immigration to Europe will continue at it's current pace. Look at the political landscape of Europe now. It's leaning more towards towards anti immigration parties in France, Italy, UK and Germany to some extent.

Hell the Dutch has more right to the Western Cape than the Zulu for that matter.\nSouth <b> African </b>minorities (whites coloreds asians) are being discriminated against and assaulted. Farmers are being murdered and now they are having their land stolen from them with NO compensation. Sure some was stolen to begin with BUT does two wrongs make a right? And in some cases the land was unoccupied to begin with.\nThere is a push for independence for the Western Cape. This I believe is the best answer. The Western Cape was founded by the Dutch before anyone else was there. And the Western Cape is mostly minorities and speak Afrikaners. Not to mention they are more capitalist. The Western Cape isn't hardly 10% South Africas total land size. Let the Western Cape free. It's not a lot of land and it gives the minorities a place to go to live the way they want. They can speak Afrikaners and have a capitalist government. If the rest of South Africa wants to go the path of communism and ultimately failure (Zimbabwe 2.0) let them.... but let the Western Cape free.",

Building statues for those who were responsible for the suffering of others around the country is just being hard headed and cold. And it will bring <b> nothing </b>but dislike and distrust to your people. Its like building a Hitler statue in Israel. They are just asking for trouble. And refusing to acknowledge Mandela at all just shows their<b>  racism</b> mentality. \nApartheid might have ended in south Africa but in the minds of these whites in that town and some others its still alive in their minds and hearts and they just don't want to mix with the blacks or share anything with them. And if these whites were the majority i do not think blacks in South Africa would be as free as they are.  \nYou can't fly <b> a Naz</b>i flag in Israel and expect to get along with others. You can't fly a Isis flag in America or Europe and expect a pat in the back. So why do they think praising the Apartheid way of life and its leaders will make them any friends. \nIf the whites mixed more with the blacks and involved them more in their farms and made sure the blacks around their farms benefited in a way from their farms what you are hearing and seeing now would not be happening. Am not saying the blacks should not get things for themselves but since the colonialists and the Apartheid regime clearly favored the whites and enabled them to grow their businesses and farms it would only be in their best interest to share some of the profits with the blacks now. help them grow too.",

And to make out that these people are uniformly pro-Apartheid is Fake News. It's also hypocritical, considering how many <b> black-</b>only townships and villages exist in the country. The difference between Orania and Apartheid-era South Africa is that the people of Orania are mostly working-class Afrikaners who don't employ<b>  black</b> servants and labourers. This is where Apartheid failed; bringing in blacks from the tribal homelands into the major cities and farms a<b> s migran</b>t labour, when all it did was compromise the original intent of the Apartheid policy of maintaini<b> ng ethn</b>ic homogeneity and development. White Oranians doing their own menial labour is as far from <b> the </b>old Apartheid system as you can get, and the scummy MSM tries to depict these people as bigots because they choose to live apart from other South Africans. As if they didn't TRY to co-exist for years, when blacks were assaulting them, killing their families and stealing their stuff. This is it is necessary for them to live separately.

These Institutions and Symbols are important parts to White South <b> African </b>cultures. \n\n\nLet's look to the United States where I currently live. Latinos move to the US from a number of countries in the Americas. Overtime these Latino communities lose their language. Second they lose their practices as they adapt to American culture. In  successive generations, these communities dissolve. Most White Latinos do not identify as Latino within 2 generations.\n\n\nCulture is in constant flux and change, however in a society like South Africa, where the ANC desires to erase the symbols and institutions of the White Minority due to it's connection to colonialism, imperialism, and Apartheid, it is no wonder that some would desire to preserve their culture.",

I think it's great that Afrikaans people want to preserve their culture because it forms a part of their identity but i just don''t think that isolating yourself from the rest of the world in the way that Orania has in South Africa is the way things should be done. \n\n\nIn my Sout<b> h Africa</b>n passport the front page says that we all should be able to move across our country freely-i don''t think that everyone is welcome to go to Orania. I also feel like the ANC is trying to balance the power-distribution in South Africa hence inowadays it's more difficult for white people t find jobs but it's not that their trying to erase white culture or identity. \n\n\nI mean, if you calculate the percentage of wealth distribution in South Africa, white people who are the minority (like you said) dominate a significant amount of it. So my feel is that the ANC are trying to balance that and it feels as though they are erasing white culture but really their not. (I'm addressing the one gentleman who moved to Orania because of job-difficulties) \n\n\nAgain, culture preservation isn't a problem-it's how you preserve it that matters because we live in a country full of people so we all do have to shar<b> e.

South Africans of all races send their children to these schools because they want them to have a solid education. ANC backed public schools are an absolute failure. Teachers can't even pass the tests they give. \n\n\nOrania represents a handful of people. Afrikaner culture exists and evolves in Jozi, Cape Town and in many rural areas of the country. You are correct, you would not be welcome in Orania to live. Neither would I. We aren't Afrikaners. The ANC is a corrupt institution looking to blame Whites for their failure to live up to their promises. The jobs policies are bad. Young White South Africans are leaving in droves. They take with them their education. The Country is suffering severe brain drain. \n\n\nYes, White dominate the wealth and resources of the country. THis is in part due to colonialism, apartheid and in more current generations, education. Democracy must have safeguards from protecting minorities from majority tyranny. \n\n\nOrania is a financially self sustaining community that doesn't take from society.

In  South Africa, these people took the initiative. Why does it offend you that these people would want to live among their own people in an isolated environment? Most Afrikaners live outside of Orania. Most young don't want to live there. They do interact with other groups and South <b> African </b>society overall, but on their terms. There is<b>  nothing</b> wrong with that. Why can't you accept them for who they are? Offense is inferred. If they so wish for their own little safe space, let them. Why is it your desire to destroy them?",

Now that\u00a0South Africa is a democracy a lot of the students who go to these universities aren't Afrikaans like it probably was before and this means that universities need to accommodate for everybody-there is a compromise because English is the most universal option When you refer to<b>  black</b> people, you sa<b> y blac</b<b> >k Afric</b>an culture because there are so m<b> any bl</b>ack S<b> outh Afr</b>ican cultures-what does this tell you about the amount of cultures that have to comprise? I'm Xhosa and I personally wouldn't be okay with the syllabus being taught in Sotho and neither would the jillions of other cultures Secondly, for a very long<b>  time </b>black people weren't allowed the resources and means of starting their own institutions which perhaps would've been competitive towards modern day institutions and if you say that the government should make one for them, what are they going to do in the meanwhile? I feel like inspiring the idea of separation will equate to hatred. Why should we isolate ourselves and hide our cultures instead of flaunt them and admire other people's cultures out in the open? We all have freedom of choice but the way you wish to run school-systems in South Africa actually depletes that.Afrikaans peop<b> le are A</b>frican, and so universities must accommodate <b> for all </b>African cultures.",

How is it my desire to destroy them? when did I mention that I wanted to destroy them? A lot of people including myself don't agree with the idea but again, a lot of us haven't gone out of our way to destroy their homes and their lives-if people wanted to do that they would've done so long ago. I find it offensive because so many people (even my own family)\u00a0fought\u00a0with their lives so that every citizen in modern South Africa could live united and freely. If South Africa accepts one group of people initiating a pre-democracy trend then that means that it should occur across South Africa which implies that the idea of APARTheid is okay but really it isn't.The people who explained the reason why they're in Orania implied that there is a problem with modern day South Africa and that South Africa wasn't cut out for them. If there are some Afrikaans children who co-exist with the rest of South Africa then maybe South Africa isn't so bad.",

The Zulu King for example sold them land on condition that they settle between him and his enemy another<b>  black</b> tribe, so it brought piece to his people. The Zulu King, Xhosa King, Venda etc all have their original land still to this day. Th<b> e blac</b>k Kings had full independence untill England invaded South Africa and stole the pieces of land the whites owned, you see the country called South Africa was made with borders and all by the Queen. This set the path and laws that were then put in place, breaking up all the treaties. Ask yourself why in all the years of Apartheid did the blacks not go and stay with their kings in their independent countries if it was so bad. The whites gave them running water, money, food and housing and a much better life than they had living in mude huts with their kings.",

You see everything is traced back to ancestry, and the culture, which is embedded in the minds of the decendents since birth so this is not a racial issue but a more deeper one which needs to be addressed if you want to get anywhere.

Do you even know how the economy is runned? Do you even know what the purpose of a farm is? Farms are used to supply a city with food. Cities are also a european design. Thats why we have farms, to supply the cities with food.

As for the 'battle of blood river' again it was the Zulus who attacked the small group of Afrikaners. As for the Slaughtering that was England who did that and they slaughtered both the Afrikaners and Zulus and put the Afrikaner wifes and children in concentration camps and took their 2 countries the Free State and ZAR (now Gauteng province) away from them. Also the Zulus were chasing the other <b> black </b>tribes around and vice versa. The tribes were fighting each other and large tribes lived mostly in the areas where there kings now still live, although most were Nomadic having to flee from place to place so as to not get killed by a stronger<b>  black</b> tribe. Thos<b> e blac</b>k kings who settled had in any event obtained that land by killing the Khoi and San people. Blacks lived with their kings and their wasn't so many of them. The country was scarcely populated, so their was more than enough space for everyone and each had their own country, but then the Afrikaners found gold and the English in Kimberley found diamonds, then the British army was promptly sent, just as the US is now sent whenever oil control is at stake. The Afrikaners never came to conquer like the British, they came mostly to flee from religious persecution, many being protestant and not catholic and mostly to just come and farm on land that was just bush and plenty of it. Anyway, one only hears of the Jewish concentration camps and not the Afrikaner ones. As for the bad deal of some treaties, yes that is true, but so did the Afrikaners lose their countries and after they regained it, lost it again in 1994 through 'democracy' that again only cares abo<b> ut bla</b>ck and white <b> and bl</b>ack tribal violence and crime against whites can now fester without impediment or control. Without the self-defence that whites could only obtain through the Apartheid system there is now no hope for them. The argument now is don't worry about so many whites getting murdered, nearly just as many blacks are getting murderded, so it is just crime. The thing is whites could protect themselves with their own white police force and army like they did in Apartheid, but now they are not allowed to.....Soon they will be using the military weapons whites built to protect themselves with to shoot them,  all in the name of international sanctions and America's calls for 'Democracy'. Democracy for <b> each </b>race separately in their own country is all that works. Look at Zimbabwe etc. No go zones in Sweden, knife stabbings in London. Muslims demanding Sharia law and once they become majority will turn whatever country into an Islamic state with no democracy anymore. Look at tensions rising. Multiculturism is failing worldwide.Blacks back to Africa, whites back to Europe, only solution, else expect permanent riots, protests and civil wars and total destruction of white civilisation. That is the goal in any event and it is what ww2 was about, but the <b> white</b> race lost. Forced multiculturism would follow and total annihilation of the<b>  whit</b>e race as end goal. Who is behind it? Globalist Zionists? Was everything Adolf said true? Sure looks like it. As he said the only way they could ever rule over the E<b> urope</b>an race is if they make it a bas<b> tardi</b>zed race of mongrels and that is their goal! We know again, it is nearly too late. Adolf told you who owns and controls the media that tells people what they must believe and stones those who oppose such false views. Who runs all the lobby groups to promote multiculturism and forced immigration of blacks into white countries? They brought blacks into the Rhineland. The end is nigh!",

Thus it is no longer so called stolen. Records show that the land that was taken forcefully was indeed returned to those tribes, but the land the Bantu stole from the San is yet to be taken into account. Records show that not all land was stolen, and some was bought from the San the first people and only claimants' to South Africa. Political smoke and mirrors tend to warp the truth a bit. Go research the Zulu King who sold land to the Boers as a buffer from his enemies, and in return they would protect him. Their are many such incidents in history, hidden because it is not politically conducive of the agendas at hand.",

I understand some words but like my Spanish can speak very little. I wouldn't want to learn Dutch because in the real world it carries no weight from an international  business or educational point if view globally. It's useless outside of Holland hence why very few bother to learn it. \n\nSecondly Yes South Africa was a Dutch colony but Afrikaners are a combination of Dutch, French Huguenots, German, Scandinavian, Malay and Khoisan. These are the facts. Afrikaners, their language and culture were formed in South Africa.\n\nSimply put they were settlers or slaves when they arrived, mixed and became AFRIKANERS...... not Dutch etc... but AFRIKANERS. If I use your poor logic once again, according to you the Zulu are also not indigenous to SOUTH Africa because their language started as a Bantu language from the Great Lakes area of central Africa and only reached the east coast of South Africa in the 16th century. Thats when the modern day Zulu language were created. In other words an \"off shoot\" of the Bantu language. Another way to look at your argument from an <b> African </b>perspective is like saying North Africans are not<b>  African</b> because they speak a dialect if Arabic and French. Also over 50% of Afrikaans speakers ar<b> e blac</b>k...does that mean they are also not indigenous?\n\nSee my point sunshine. I'm not going to stoop to your level calling you all sorts of names.

While blacks moved into white townships, whites aren't allowed to do the same. That would be gentrification. Why haven't blacks used their political and economic power to create new towns? Why is it always about consumption and taken over what has already being built? They wouldn't seize vacant land without expropriation. It always has to be a farmland with structures already on it.

Most would be happy with some form of exchange. I.e trade whites from South Africa for <b> black </b>refugees in Europe, but I don't see any chance of the powers that be to make this happen. Whenever anyone would suggest such a thing then there are screams of<b>  racism</b> in European countries that it i<b> s racis</b>t to suggest whites from Africa should be exchanged f<b> or bla</b>ck refugees and those who suggest it are called Nazi's. Fact is however that the blacks don't want whites in Africa and whites will be happy to go to Europe if the channels are opened.",

Land was also bought and treaties entered into by the Afrikaners, they were farmers so had to bargain for everything they got - paying with cattle for additional land etc. Then Britain invaded and conquered the<b>  black</b> Kingdoms and Boer Republics and took away all the borders and called it South Africa. The white government after independence gave the blacks all their Kingdoms back with full right to rule unrestricted. Th<b> e blac</b>k kings and presidents did not develop those countries causing all their subjects to leave and come and work in the white man's factories etc. When the white man leaves it becomes totally tribal again and everything falls apart. Like in Zimbabwe and the rest of Africa. Cannibalism of themselves is their future, as is already happening in so<b> me afric</b>an countries.

The government simply responds that it is just crime and Europe and the rest simply respond by saying South Africa is a crime ridden country as well, however the rate of killing of white farmers is about 8 to 1 to that of <b> black </b>citizens. The government is doing<b>  nothing</b> to protect the farmers etc which they could easily do with special commando forces etc (which th<b> e ol</b>d white government had etc), t<b> he bla</b>ck government had these forces disbanded. The government is actively calling for land to be taken from whites without compensation and have passed a motion to proceed with constitutional amendment to change the countries constitution to make provision for expropriation without compensation i.e theft. Of course more than 50% of these farms were bought and sold in the last 25 years, but according to <b> the bl</b>ack government the land that was bought and mortgaged, most only a few years ago, was somehow stolen by whites. But yes, the European countries will only <b> give ref</b>ugee status if the government itself starts shooting the white citizens and by that time it will already be to late for most. Of course we saw the same story recently in Zimbabwe, but most of the whites their could get British passports, whereas the whites in South Africa cannot, as most of their forefathers have been in South Africa since the 1700's already.",

The farm land belongs to the Dutch speaking Boers, not the Xhosa, Zulu or any<b>  black</b> tribe.\nMeanwhile, the Bantu people are NOT native to SA but invaded that country from the north and stole much from the original Khoi and San inhabitants. Likewise, if you are <b> a blac</b>k Caribbean, American or Canadian who owns property and believe that the EFF and BLF should get their way, then you need to donate all your property in the Caribbean, US or Canada to the local Native tribal council. But of course we all know you never will because you afro-centric shitheads always think of yourselves as victims. Newsflash: YOU ARE NOT!",

There are people who think their perception, added with their wishes are true facts no matter what. The version of South Africa's history that has been taught or that was taught in our schools has been polluted with fabricated material details that don't reconcile with anthropology and archaeology. This was purely design. Without questioning the Khoisan theory, some people are riding on the deception that these Khoisan owned the southern part of Africa which has now become South Africa. Truth is that there is a great variant of the khoi, san, basarwa, xhosa, batswana, bushmen etc. They did not identify as one homogenous group. They lived together but had deferential characteristics in how they lived and interacted. The funny part is that some people who have been identified as <b> coloured </b>by the previous regimes, are now thinking that they are the so called Khoisan whereas they are not. Some are even used by certain forces to falsely claim that they are kings of the indigenous community of the Khoi and the San. In truth,  the Batswana and Xhosa have more Khoisan DNA than those imposed by the greedy section of the society. The southern part of Africa was occupied before the Portuguese and Europeans tried to colonise it. It's just the numbers were not as high as they are now.",

It is you who seems to be suffering from an inferiority complex, because I work and know many people of color who are proud of who they are and what they achieved.

It's like saying all people who shares the fundamentals of the Latin language, regardless of timeline, can lay claim to Italy. Heck even Afrikaans have 10% Khoisan words in it lexicon, what does that say if I apply your logic?\n\nNow in regards to what links the Boere to Africa? Depends on what you mean. Well for starters we were in South Africa before the Nguni tribes that make up almost 70% of <b> black </b>SA. We invented technology like the windpomp to conquer the 60% semi desert. We brought the wheel, rule of law, modern medicine that ensured your forefathers life expectancy grew from 32 to 68. Afrikaans is the only<b>  African</b> language that wrote internationally regarded scientific papers. Heck we even performed the first heart transplant raising the international perception that Africa is not a backward continent. We also, compared to the rest of AFRICA, YES THE WHOLE CONTINENT, pai<b> d blac</b>k people 8x more.\n\nOur language and culture were formed in Africa and are unique in the world, so by definition we are indeginous. Some of our genetics are mixed with Khoisan for example FW de Klerk is an ancestor of Krotoa. \n\nSo, tell me apart from falling out of your mothers in central Africa, moving to South Africa after the white man, then killing between 1.5 to 2 milli<b> on bla</b>ck people during conquest in the Mfecane and having a different skin colour.

Also Currently the farm murder rate is 108 per 100 000 vs the average rate of 36 per 100 000. You are 3x more likely to be murdered and tortured  if you are a farmer. \n\nApartheid lasted from '48 to '92.

Remember the ANC's people war on their own people? The one <b> where </b>black people were necklaced for thinking differently?\n\nRegarding the Mfecane numbers, seriously? do your own research. This an easily verifiable fact. I see what your problem, you live with a victim mentality, you blame everything wrong with your life on the white man, too lazy to think for yourself or in this case find the answers yourself, why? Because that's what the communists want you to think and react.",

Funny thing is, the European settlers did not find it like that.......Here is a thought, I am sure there is a lot of non farmed land in SA.  Why doesn't the government give all its <b> black </b>citizens a parcel of undeveloped land to clear, to seed, to irrigate, to farm........that does not sound too appealing does it...sounds like too much WORK.",

South Africa is 60% semi desert with a low water table. It's been proven scientifically and anthropologically  that these tribes couldn't and didn't settle in the whole of SA. This was also confirmed in a 1910 land survey which showed these tribes only occupied 9% of the land.

I know this because family of mine wanted to purchase land north of  the Sodwana and St Lucia areas and were told by the Chief that they couldn't because only Zulu could live in that particular area. I know of similar rules in the Eastern Cape. My Xhosa friends says the same about where Zulu can and cannot live in the Eastern Cape.  You and your family probably live in the city where these things are there to an extent but not enforced like in the traditional areas.",

The 1910 land survey confirms this, the lack of historical or anthropological evidence of the Nguni in 91% of the  country proves that as well as the fact that SA is 60% semi desert with a low water table meaning it was impossible for the Nguni to live and survive in these areas. Again scientifically proven. These are facts, it's irrelevant if you don't believe me, it still stays as the FACTS.",

Not so with farm murders. They rarely know the victims and farm murders are almost exclusive when it comes to torture being used.\n\nThe Farm murder rate is 108 per 100 000 vs the average rate of 36 per 100 000. In the USA the murder rate is 4.6 per 100 000. Anywhere else in the world you would conclude they are being targeted.\n\nThe difference are that 1) the commando system was stopped by the government and 2) the government refuses to make this a priority crime even though things like rhino poaching or cash in transit heists are priority crimes. WHY not farm murders when 1 farmer feeds 2000 people? Why are there spikes in farm killings when they sing \"kill the boer\". WHY do they rarely steal anything of great value in farm murders? Why are they using military grade phone jammers that cost more than the contents of the farm house? Why are Ramaphosa denying a demonstrable truth?",

The few local inhabitants lived in small self sustaining communities. These small communities were totally unaware of the existence outside of their stone wall kraal. This may come as a surprise to you but they did not have cell phones, roads or any form of transport. They were totally isolated without any concept of provincial or country borders. So...what country are you referring to?\nDuring the 19th century the white man trekked into Southern Africa establishing towns etc. The country consisting of mostly non arable land, was uninhabited. The first non whites were found along the east coast in small communities. They were unaware of the existence of other tribes, boundaries etc. They did not even have means to cross rivers. Isolated.\nNow you read the rest.

And now when they are trying to clean up the mess, <b> the bl</b>ack guy has the rightfull claim to the land but the current owner can be a legitimate, honest guy who didnt steal but paid for it. What do you do in a situation like that? Take the land from the guy who didnt steal it or dont give it back to the guy who had it stolen from him? Other one is going to be left feel bitter. My relatives were driven out by the Russians from their home and we fought against the ussr and nazis in wwii and drove them out of our lands, but we ended up losing some to the ussr. Now some russian family, probaply poorer than me, lives in a spot of land that i have rightfull claim. But they probaply were hardworking people who paid honest money for that land and own it rightfully. But still it was stolen from my family. But not by that family, by the Stalin<b>  and commu</b>nist regime of ussr. \nYesterday i left comment on this section too that i didnt think fully through...",

They say learn your history before you talk. well here is the history you speak of. \n\nThe history of white colonial land dispossession dates back to the expansion of the Dutch colonial settlement in the Cape, which was established after the Dutch East India Company (DEIC) authorised Jan van Riebeeck to set up a refreshment station for their ships. Land was seized from the Khoikhoi and later the San to increase Dutch grazing pastures, expand their farming activities and to establish settlements. Over time, the increasing lack of access to grazing pastures by the Khoikhoi gave rise to conflict with the Dutch. While in some instances the Khoikhoi were successful, the Dutch defeated the latter and expropriated more of their land. As a result, the Khoikhoi and the San were systematically deprived of their livelihood forcing them to seek employment on the farmlands of white colonial settlers. Thus, the period between 1652 and 1799 is largely characterized by Dutch colonial expansion through occupation of land and resistance against this by the indigenous inhabitants.",

I'm also sick to death of whites and white nations being singled out for criticism regarding slavery, similar to how only whites are criticized for conquest. All peoples have practiced conquest and slavery, also all peoples have been slaves. The Muslim slave trade operated for much longer and was much more brutal, but you never here them being criticized. Whites have also been slaves, but that's also never mentioned. blacks have owned (and to this day still do own) slaves, again never mentioned. Inconvenient to the leftist narrative and agenda. The leftist politicians have an agenda, but their followers are just fools that refuse to gain a sense of perspective.",

And today the same white man who thought ngunis how to write is on the run begging for refuge visa in Australia, Canada,New Zealand ,USA .well let me tell you about what zulu people call IZITHAKAZELO. Xhosa people call it IZIBONGO.All <b> African </b>cultures have it .its clan history every child is thought when they are young and goes beyond 10 generations including you ancestors names, pedigree. Thats the same system used to identify our cousins from diffrent tribs and clans and tells us who not to marry since we share blood with them .\u270a\ud83c\udffe something you have never heard about and never thought it existed that's how we know who we are something you dont have and yet claim to be african",
