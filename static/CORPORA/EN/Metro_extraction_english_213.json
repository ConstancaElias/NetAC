        "postText": "Tommy Robinson is believed to have broken electoral law as he announced his bid to become an MEP with a free barbecue.', 'The former English Defence League founder spoke at a rally in Manchester on Thursday night, confirming he will stand as an Independent at next month\u2019s EU elections.', 'However, the rally offered free burgers and hot dogs from a catering van \u2013 which breaks the law on inducements to vote.', 'Police were said to have phoned Robinson to tell him he needed to stop.', 'The would-be politician then announced to the 300-strong crowd that he could no longer give away free food.', 'Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has pledged a \u2018David vs Goliath\u2019 battle to represent the \u2018betrayed working class\u2019.', 'The far-right activist claims his election would send \u2018elite\u2019 politicians a \u2018message they\u2019ll never forget.\u2019', '\u2018Everyone is so disillusioned with the liars in Parliament, but that is also our weakness,\u2019 he said.', '\u2018It\u2019s the reason we are being betrayed and will continue being betrayed, until they fear us.', '\u2018The only way they will fear us is if we take their seats.\u2019', 'Robinson is standing as an Independent MEP for the North West region.', 'Candidates are not allowed to offer hospitality, entertainment or financial inducements to electors intended to influence their votes or likely to have that effect.', 'Anyone convicted of the offence faces an unlimited fine and up to a year in jail.', 'Greater Manchester Police (GMP) confirmed to Metro.co.uk they had spoken to Robinson, added: \u2018Prior to an event held in Wythenshaw yesterday, GMP advised the organiser that providing gifts of food could potentially breach electoral regulations.', '\u2018This was not given as a direction but offered as a piece of advice to the organiser.\u2019', 'Robinson has said he will target traditional Labour voters in his bid to get elected to the European Parliament.', 'He will continue to act as an adviser to Ukip leader Gerard Batten, despite running against eight of the party\u2019s candidates.', 'He is unable to join Ukip\u2019s membership under party rules because anyone who has previously been an English Defence League member is banned.', 'Within hours of Robinson\u2019s announcement, anti-racism campaigners launched a counter-movement.', 'Anti-extremism campaigners Hope Not Hate called for voters to sign up to oppose the \u2018far-right thug\u2019.', 'Chief executive Nick Lowles said: \u2018Stephen Lennon is a far-right thug who uses his platform to bully, abuse and stir up division, monetising his hatred to rake in donations from his fans.\u2018The North West needs a voice of hope, not hatred.\u2019', 'Robinson launched his campaign on the Wythenshawe estate, a huge post-war housing development on the edge of south Manchester.', 'He said he will be campaigning in working-class communities across the North West to target those who \u2018religiously\u2019 vote Labour.', 'He claimed 96% of MPs were middle class with privately educated children who \u2018know nothing about the estates or the communities we come from.\u2019', 'Robinson\u2019s plan was criticised by the local Labour MP, Mike Kane, and a group of local church and faith leaders.', 'Mr Kane said the activist was \u2018not welcome to spread his xenophobic, Islamophobic, homophobic, racist vitriol in my community or in any other community\u2019.', 'Mr Kane added: \u2018He seeks to divide rather than to unite people. We do things differently in Manchester, we stand together against hate.\u2019', 'Voters go to the polls on May 23, if the Euro elections go ahead which depends on whether agreement is reached over EU withdrawal.', 'Robinson\u2019s appointment as a Ukip adviser on rape gangs and prison reform has seen a string of people quit the party in protest.', 'Nigel Farage said Ukip was becoming \u2018obsessed with Islam\u2019 and launched his own Brexit Party.', 'As an independent with no party funding, Robinson has resorted to asking his supporters for money to donate towards \u2018the movement.\u2019",
