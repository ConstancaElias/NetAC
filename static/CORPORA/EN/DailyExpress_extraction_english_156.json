MM has moaned we have not asked how she is, YET SHE has never asked how her Father is after he suffered a heart attack. Kate doesn't give a speech at a charity event and talk purely about herself!  In short , Kate is not hypocritical and self absorbed!",

If she says she's worried about it, he'll give her anything she wants and her emotional blackmail will be missed by him because all he's doing is mistakenly thinking that his wife will fall victim to what Diana did. This may well be the case because both Diana and Meghan American PR firm court the press. Meghan's problem is that while the press have given her positive coverage, the public can see right through her and dislike her. I for one am suspicious of Tatler's poll. Who did they ask 20 year olds with no knowledge of how a royal should be?",
