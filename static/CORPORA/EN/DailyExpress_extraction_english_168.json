        "postText": "'Boris Johnson has repeatedly ignored demands from Brussels to appoint a UK commissioner to the EU. This has prompted fury from leading EU leaders, like new European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. SNP MEP Alyn Smith hit out at Boris Johnson for refusing to send in a British representative.', 'Mr Smith then asked Brexit Party MEP Lucy Harris to give up her salary and allowances for the time she 's still in the European Parliament.', 'However, Ms Harris ridiculed this argument, pointing that Britain had already voted to leave the EU three years ago.', ' Mr Smith said: \u201cI will point out that it is a legal obligation, because the EU is based on a community based on justice and the rule of law.', ' The UK is flagrantly in breach because of our irresponsible government.', 'He added: Presumably, you yourself are in favour of giving up your salary and allowances for the time here if you\u2019 re happy to not have a commission.', 'Ms Harris fired back at these claims, before defending Mr Johnson's decision not to appoint a European Commissioner.', ' The MEP insisted that her SNP colleague was wrong in targeting the UK side, and instead pointed out that the EU had held up Britain 's departure.', ' She said: Under UK law we cannot do it during an election period, under purdah, so that\u2019 s one reason. ', ' Another reason is that we have to answer to the British public, we don\u2019 t answer to the EU law.', 'We made that very clear in 2016 when we voted to leave the EU.', 'This comes amid concerns that the European Commission would still be allow to take Britain to court even after Brexit takes place.', 'The Prime Minister\u2019s withdrawal agreement allows the bloc to continue infringement procedures against the country after January 31, 2020, according to a leading eurocrat.', 'Two weeks ago, the European Commission launched a legal action, which could end with Britain sued in the European Court of Justice, after the Prime Minister failed to abide by EU law and nominate a candidate for commissioner.', 'The Government ignored a written warning from the Brussels-based executive, which demanded a response by last Friday.', 'This week, the European Council adopted a decision that allows Ursula von der Leyen to begin her term on December 1 without a British commissioner.', 'They said: This cannot undermine the regular functioning of the Union and its institutions and thus cannot constitute an obstacle to the appointment of the next Commission in order for it to start exercising the full range of its power under the Treaties as soon as possible.'",
