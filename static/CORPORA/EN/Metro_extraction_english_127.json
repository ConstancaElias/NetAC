        "postText": "When I think of Enid Blyton a picture of a golliwog emerges in my mind and I feel almost tearful.', 'While the Royal Mint\u2019s decision to not produce a 50p coin with her on it \u2013 due to her racist and homophobic views \u2013 has been met with outrage, I applaud the decision.', 'You see, I was that six year old girl, arriving in a small Hertfordshire town in the late 1960s from Jamaica, taken to an almost all white school. It was there where I was introduced to Blyton for the first time and it is safe to say, she was a culture shock.', 'The children in my class thought the golliwogs in Enid Blyton\u2019s books looked like me, the only black child in the class, bringing laughter from my teacher.', 'I knew the golliwog didn\u2019t look like me \u2013 but it was extremely upsetting and uncomfortable that my little classmates thought that it did and that this was also okay with the teacher.', 'I know Blyton was a product of society, educated to think less of people of colour or anyone different to what she considered the norm to be. She came from a time where the majority of her peers accepted these beliefs. She was writing from a place of privilege, where her own experience showed her ignorance, lack of understanding and total disregard for other cultures.', 'As a black woman and an author, I\u2019m attracted to writing books that represent me and my environment, books that will entertain my readers and bring them into the private and intimate lives of diverse characters.', 'A racist is a racist, racism is racism, no matter when it took place or who the perpetrator is or was', 'You hope they love the characters you create them to love, your protagonist, and loathe the antagonist. That\u2019s exactly what Miss Blyton did \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t mean that her prejudice shouldn\u2019t be held to account now.', 'I hear Richard Madeley and all the other opinions that condemns the Royal Mint\u2019s decision. I say, they have no idea of what this means for many children and people of colour; only the privilege that white skin gives can say, \u2018don\u2019t use 21st century ideals to judge 20th century work of art\u2019.', 'I get it. I get that it\u2019s pretty upsetting for the proud, heroic Great British Empire to be associated with anything that downgrades her greatness. But what the British Empire did historically, and how minority communities have been presented and represented in British literature, has had far reaching affects on non-white communities across generations.', 'Institutional racism is prevalent, alive and kicking but is always being justified, denied even. What perhaps the 21st century has highlighted is how unequal, unconcerned and unaware our society is, and that we can decide that a certain person shouldn\u2019t be called a racist because they contributed to the development of an industry or our country. Again this is a privilege only given to certain sections of society.', 'The six year old inside of me was never able to comfortably enjoy the Famous Five when the teacher read it out in class. My little heart would beat so fast, because I kept thinking a golliwog was going to pop up in the story, and I would be laughed at again.', 'A racist is a racist, racism is racism, no matter when it took place or who the perpetrator is or was.', 'Racist\u2019s works should never be celebrated, and I applaud the decision of the Royal Mint to think outside of the dominant elite culture of the privileged few (who seem to believe everything they think), and not to downplay racism or racist narrative.",

A golliwog is a widely recognised rasict slur. No one can dispute that. Ms Blyton compounded that imagery (albeit through ignorance), and that has undoubtely caused us minorities some pain in childhood. I experienced the same in the 80's.",
