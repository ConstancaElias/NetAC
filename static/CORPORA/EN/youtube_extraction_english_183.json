        "postText": " Being a parent and bringing up kids the right way, giving them the best you can, being strict just enough and yet winning their love is not an easy task. We all know that words can hurt deeper than a knife, which is why knowing how to communicate with your kids and what not to do is key. Pay attention to these phrases you should never say to your kids or teens to help them and protect them. . . . If your teen is upset about something, whether it's a crush that won't notice them or a fight with their best friend, you shouldn't just tell them that they're okay. This type of response from you will only make things worse.. A study conducted by the University of Notre Dame found that when parents criticize themselves out loud with their children nearby, it can actually have a detrimental effect on their kids' self-esteem.. If you want your child to grow up to be self-sufficient, don't be too hands-on. You can, however, guide them through a problem and help them find the right solution themselves. This way, your child will grow up knowing that everything is in their own hands, instead of na\u00efvely waiting for somebody else to come and make all their problems disappear.. . Music:  . Audionautix - Straighty Baby. https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/.... . TIMESTAMPS. #10. 'You're okay.' 0:50. #9. 'I'm so fat!' 1:50. #8. 'Hurry up!' 2:47. #7. 'Don't be sad.' 3:50. #6. 'Let me do it.' 4:50. #5. 'You're so incredible!' 5:52. #4. 'Good job!' 7:10. #3. 'You need to set a good example for your little brother/sister' 8:04. #2. 'Go kiss Grandma.' 9:02. #1. 'I'm so proud of you!' 9:55. . SUMMARY. -Instead of telling your kids it's okay, be their shoulder to cry on, listen to them, and acknowledge their feelings. This way, they won't be afraid to come to you if something bad happens.. -Our parents are our role models as we're growing up, and their behavior sets an example for us. So, for example, when a mother calls herself fat all the time, her daughter subconsciously learns to view her body and appearance the same way.. -Rushing just puts unnecessary pressure on your kid. Whatever you do, just try to keep a positive and playful vibe in the morning, your kid will surely appreciate it.. -If your teen is sad or crying, sit them down and try to help them work through their feelings, that is, if they're comfortable opening up.. -If you tend to jump in too soon, you may undermine your child's independence. They'll develop a habit of always looking to others for answers, and nobody wants that for their kids.. -Inflated praise somehow puts even more pressure on children with low self-esteem as opposed to encouraging them. They start to worry about meeting the high standards you set again, so they're afraid to take on a challenge.. -Asking questions about the details and the work it took to get the result keeps the focus on your kid and makes them explain their choices, both of which help their self-confidence a lot.. -It's better to use phrases, like 'Your brother/sister looks up to you!' or 'You're such a role model for your little brother/sister!'. -Children should never be forced to do anything that makes them uncomfortable, especially when it comes to physical contact.. -Children may start to feel responsible for expressed parental pride, like they need to keep it up because that's the only way that Mom or Dad will feel good or love them.. .

They aren't perfect and trust that they're doing the best they know how to. If you're smart enough to notice their mistakes, you're already smart enough to make decisions for yourself about what is right and wrong for you and how YOU want to live your life. It's not easy, it really takes emotional strength more than anything, to stand your ground against what your parents might have to say, but YOU CAN DO IT! It's easier the younger you are (and the less of life that you know). You will have to separate yourself mentally and emotionally at some point anyway. So might as well not waste the precious time of your life trying to get your parents to get you and agree with you. Btw, that IS what growing up really means - being free and not depending on your parents approval.\n\nIf you need a real role model and guidance and someone to accept you and console you and give you good advice, go to Jesus. He is perfect. Your parents are not.",

I am Muslim and our holiday called Eid was last week on Tuesday. I got to see my dad and was excited bc I hadn't since October 2018. When I saw him though, he repeatedly said \"Give me a hug\" even though I said I don't do hugs. Not because I'm secretly a psychopath who loves watching natural disasters and people upset but it's because I shut myself away from people. A lot of people don't know what it's like having to choose between your parents and that can even lead to depression. Or make it worse if you already have it, like me...\n\n\nMy point is that I agree with them saying \"Don't force your kids to hug/kiss relatives.\" I haven't kissed anyone in 8 years and I'm 14... Not starting again.",

Whenever I got a test even if I got a good score my mom would ask me what my friend got because my mom knew she was one of the smart kids. But my friend didn't like showing other people her grades so I couldn't give my mom an answer. Finally I was able to make my mom stop comparing me to my friend. This is also the reason why I'm not friend with the girl who my mom compared me to, and what makes it even more sad is the fact that we used to be BFFs.",

Here we're 'quite' okay with getting a 6.0-7.5, just as long as you're passing the class, while of course higher grades help more I can't help but wonder why it's so important",

It's basically placing a tally mark on the paper when the speaker in church says the word of the day. Nia really wanted to color with me, but her dad forced her to stop coloring and scolded her that she's not tallying even when she was multitasking (coloring and tallying when she heard the word). I felt so bad because they were making her do something that could be a lot of fun and turned it into a chore. After church, she told me, 'Everyone has been so mean to me lately except you'. I know it's important to teach kids to pay attention and developing their listen skills but we really can't force them to listen if they don't want to. I like how the video points out that we shouldn't pressure them to do something they aren't comfortable with.",

My son remembers the abuse my ex- put me through.  But he is the spitting image of his father. I have always done my best to never use that phrase.  I married another man about 10 years later, and one day my son was acting out, being silly trying to get me to laugh, my husband came in the door and misread the situation, He got angry and told my son to stop acting out, he was acting like his dad. My son got so angry, worse then I have ever seen him.  He started yelling, most of what he said was not understandable because he was crying so hard.  My husband just got angrier, so I grabbed him by the arm and we went out to the front porch and I explained the situation, then I asked him to apologize to him he did not see the need, so I said would you do it for me?  So he apologized to my son.  And they got along better after I spent the night telling my husband about my first husband.  He got up in the morning and woke up my son and really apologized to him for real.",

It's important to keep in mind that teens have all kinds of personalities, just like adults do. Part of being a good parent includes knowing how to treat each child according to their personality. Some children might feel pressured by \"I'm proud of you\", but some would do anything to hear those words from their parents.",

You're just feeling this way because you have been doing<b>  nothing</b> and just sitting at a corner and crying for no reason. Stop making excuses and stop crying for no reason at all \". And then I was like \" WHATTTT ?! \". Tbh , that made me feel more depressed than usual. I wish if she would have just hugged me , instead. Cause at that time I was just so lost and helpless and yeah I guess, that's what I needed the most. And now , I don't tell about this to anyone out there cause i feel like no one really listens to you , you know. It's about 2 years , I'm still suffering this alone. :)",

I'm so sorry to hear that. You're going through so much ! You're a fighter. You're so brave ! I know you're tired of hearing such things but i just wanna let you know that - things does get better. Trust me , time heals everything or maybe it doesn't , maybe with time we just get used to it and learn how to deal with it. But eventually , it does get better. And guess what ? Sometimes it's okay to be not okay. It's okay to feel this way. Cyber bully ??! Gosh. Do something about it honey ! Don't suffer alone. You don't deserve this. And don't hide your emotions. Never ever do that. Ask someone to help you , honey. You're so brave. Just hang in there. Things will get better. Maybe not today , not tomorrow , not next week , not next month , not even next year , but one day for sure and that day you are going to say proudly to yourself \" Yes I did it ! \". You deserve the best. You deserve all the happiness in this world. Take care. :) \u2764",

Don't ever think you're not loved by your parents. Who paid for your school, who guided you while you were young, who fed and bathed you, who loved you when no one else did? I used to be so angry at my parents because they always took the blame on me for my younger brother's doing and treated me unfairly. I always criticised them since I was so filled with anger but really they were looking out for me when I did things wrong and wanted the best for me. In the real world, <b> nothing </b>is perfect and happy go lucky. This world is full of trials and tests and once our parents let us go, we're responsible for what happens next.",

If you're not on it, you're not going to school.. and your excuse note will explain you were too lazy to wake up!\"  Was late maybe 3 days that year. Then never again. I realized if I didn't make it to the momma mobile by 7:15 all ready I would eventually fail that grade and have to repeat. Good one mom! And as an adult now let me tell you.. her technique has gotten me far more responsible about punctual timing on my own to EVERYTHING!!",

Aside from that, they basically did everything wrong judging by this videos list.\nAlso doesn't help the fact that my parents also have NO Patience, if they ask me to help with something and I'm not there in exactly 0.1 seconds they're like \"NEVERMIND I'LL DO IT!\"\nMy mom also yells every little thing to me as if my hearing wasn't bad enough. Due to that I've been yelled at most of my life, which must be why I like staying with my grandparents more. They don't yell at me, they're....somewhat on board with what I plan to do in the future, but <b> nobody </b>in my family aside from my dad has any sense of privacy. Sometimes not even him. My family just thinks I'm some tool they can control and use whenever they want to. That I'm not WORTHY to keep secrets. That I'm not WORTHY to pick my friends.",

Sometimes I'll spend hours on a piece of art and be proud of it but when people go 'good for you' it makes me want to tear it up. And sometimes that what happens. I break down because I thought my piece was something to be proud of than I get the reaction of a kid bringing home a test marked as C- \n\nWell, at least you tried.

Well, in my experience, those three phrases were really encouraging for me as a child. I'd say having my parents praise me like this played an important role in me developing a healthy self-esteem. It's much better than having parents that trash talk their children and end up destroying their self-esteem.\n\nAlso, I'd argue I'd be a lot less social if my parents hadn't taught me to be affectionate with my relatives, to say hello to people and stuff. I know I'm just one person, and that my example doesn't <b> apple </b>to everyone, but that's the point. These \"no-no\" phrases don't apply to everyone.",

Also something parents should never do is compare their teens to their older siblings. I got my grades for school back recently and I thought I did really well (and all my friends were encouraging me too) BUT my parents (mainly my mum) was just like \"Why didn't you get grade 9? Your brothers did much better than you did when they were your <b> age\"</b> and I confronted her and directly told her that if she was trying to get me to do better than comparing me to my brothers wasn't the way to do that and all I really wanted to hear was more of a \"Oh well done! Maybe you could've done better but I'm sure you tried your hardest and that's all that matters.\" (btw I got a grade 7 which is equivalent to an A in the<b>  old</b> GCSE grades and I'm in yr 9 moving to yr 10 now). So yh... There's the story of my life right there XD. \nLong story short just don't compare your kids to any other kids (especially not their older siblings)",

It can make them overwork to combat bad self-esteem and feel very bad and worthless when they fail or burn out. You should compliment them on their personality and good turns and behaviour as well, on their hobbies and interests, on how they treat their friends, and even on their looks. Of course don't lie or over-do it in any of these - but you should show your kid that you don't see them through just one thing. Because how they think you see them will turn into how they see themselves. If their identity depends on one thing and that thing fails them, they become very vulnerable. And when that happens, they need you more than ever to compliment them on something new.",

I already had enough \" i told u \" in my life!!! Thats why shes there criticizing me on everything i do, or just doesnt get me. Then shes there yelling at me some more thats its better to talk things out. But i have way to many problem, so i go to my sisters. No help there either, cause they say its just a phase and that they've been there too. Ok? Idk. I dont need that either! So im better off talking to my 2 best friends. But when im with them, im always happy, so then this problems dont come to mind.",

It's difficult dealing with parents who are not aware of themselves, don't know themselves, and sometimes don't even love themselves. Parents forget how it was to be in a child's mind. They inflict their own idea that's not even really there's in the first place because they too have been conditioned by society since birth.

Because most of the time parents end up doing something with the private information that a teen told them that is untrustworthy. Say, a mother tells a teen that they can trust her; the teen tries to come out of the closet, then the mother dismisses everything they say and use it against them for the next week. It will make your teen have issues with trusting others , especially adults, and will make them feel completely alone and confused.",

            "commentText": "Also, never tell a child or an adolescent that they don't FEEL something, or KNOW a certain feeling. I see SO many parents, including my own who tell their children, and these are often children suffering through hardships or even depression/anxiety that ''you don't even know what that is, so stop saying you have it.'' you DON'T KNOW what someone else feels, you don't KNOW what they go through so STOP telling them they don't know or feel something. Look into it and keep a closer eye on them instead of denying their feelings or emotions, if they tell you they feel like that or have those experiences then they TRUST YOU, they think you'll care or try to help them, don't write it off, laugh at them or tell them to get over it or that they're just sad, or even that it'll pass by eventually. So many people blame video games and other media for their children committing suicide or acts of criminal offences but this is usually because their parent's don't care enough about them, ad say things like this to them. It gives a child the idea and <b> mental </b>image that they're alone and you don't care enough to try helping them, it brings on a sense of hopelessness and fear and that can cause a wide variety of bad actions to happen because of that.. Don't do that to your children, don't ruin their lives because you couldn't be bothered to care for them, to show them that you love and care for them.",

Just because you're a teenager now doesn't mean that you are more or less mature. It just means that you're older and bigger. So much more is expected out of teens because of that, and it doesn't seem fair. Trust me, I've been through similar situations. But just know that you're an amazing person, and she shouldn't have said that to you. Another way to resolve this would be to try talking it out with her. If you're upset, tell her why. If she says she hates you, ask her why. If you can both talk about why you both feel this way, you may both surely be able to make a compromise.\nI know that it can be hard to do, it can be terrifying sometimes. But I believe in you! You can do it! Keep shining on just as you have done before. As much as words can hurt, don't try to let them hurt you. Be strong, be brave, and continue being amazing.\n(Happy belated Birthday, by the way!) :)",

IMO, a lot of kids these days have lost respect for their parents because they think we don't have a clue. Society tells them that, discrediting our credentials as the upper hand or the final say. \nMy now 22 yr <b> old </b>son thought that too as a teen, But today he gets it and understands he didn't have all the answers back then and he's doing really well now!!  We always told him we were proud of him...even when he messed up because it's not what you do that makes us proud, it's who you are that were proud of. <b> \nNothing</b> wrong with saying \"you're ok\" Life isn't going to cater to kids as adults and give them everything they want. Parents have to be tough at times because life is a circus and hard at times. \"This too shall pass\"  It's prep for later. \nIMO, kids are not as sensitive as this list seems to say they are. Kids are strong and resilient with tender hearts yes and seem to love a good \" I messed up too when I was you<b> r ag</b>e\" story..haha.I agree with validating their feelings and emotions all the time, (adults need that too) \nKids should always show some respect and love to family. Time goes fast and you never know what that  hug or smile means to the older generation. It makes their whole day. \nI agree that older siblings are an example but that's pressure they don't need. Each child is responsible for their own actions and should be held accountable. \nBottom line, being a parent is not easy and neither is being a kid, but if you know they are trying and respect that, give them a break and don't sweat the small stuff.",

You need to actually get a diagnosis to be sure you have it. \nThe least you can do is Google the symptoms  to see if you relate to them, but even if you do relate, you can't assume you have it. That's called self-diagnosis, and it's not good.\nI remember I had suicidal thoughts once, but it wasn't because of depression, no, but rather sheer stress caused by my not paying attention in class, and 2 years later I was diagnosed with ADHD. \nYou could have it, but it's best to talk to a doctor about it. But if you don't trust your parents that much, I guess you don't need to tell em. \nI can maybe relate a little. I think I have OCD, though, I would rather not jump to conclusions. The reason I believe this is possible is because I get intrusive thoughts at inappropriate times, and the thoughts are often inappropriate too. I searched up OCD intrusive thoughts, and I realized those were effects, mind you, I had intrusive thoughts before exploring deeper into OCD. However, I could be wrong, because ADHD can cause intrusive thoughts too, and, after all, I was diagnosed with it. I haven't talked to my parents about it, because, uh, my thoughts are embarrassing to describe.",

All I wanted when I was younger was for my mom to say \"I'm so proud of you mija!\" The last time I remember her saying that phrase was in 2nd grade. Now here I am 20 years later still trying to get her to say that one little phrase. At this point I don't even care if she was lying I just want to hear it. And I don't want to tell her about this thing that I want because then she'll just throw it around like <b> nothing </b>and won't mean it and to me that seems way more worse than just simply lying.",

Why not both? As well as simply being more specific about what they are proud of and that it's a positive thing without making the person feel they need to be perfect all the time. Life is actually pretty complex. I have been told \u2018good for you' sarcastically and maliciously WAY more than sincerely so yeah..... otherwise decent video.

            "commentText": "Set the example. If you say something, such as \"Its a good thing to be early,\" follow through with it. Especially when your kid is younger. When your kid is younger, you're pretty much their world. You set their standards later in life.\n\nHowever if you push it, such as saying \"You have to be early!\", your kid is more likely to fight you on this. To them, it feels like an order, and kids hate being told what to do, especially when they don't want to.\n\nAs for teenagers, the same concept can apply. However it's easier to say it as advice, rather than a simple statement. If the teen doesn't follow through and it ends up hurting them, don't be condescending. No \"I told you's\" or \"I was right.\"\n\nTo a teen, this is a way of saying \"You were wrong, and I was right, now get over it.\" You might not have meant it that way, but that's how most teens are going to take it. However it's not good not to say anything either. It'll make the teen feel like it was an okay thing and a repeat might not be as bad.\n\nInstead, let them know it's alright, mistakes happen. We just gotta learn from them and keep moving.\n\nAnother thing. If you want your teen to do something, make it out as a request, not an order.\n\nFor example, \"Go take out the trash,\" is an order, and something your teen may fight you on. However, if you say \"Can you take out the trash for me?\", your teen is less likely to fight you. If they want to finish something, let them, it's usually not that important for the chore to be completed right then. But make sure they don't start anything new, it gives the feeling that if they are doing something, you are okay with them finishing it first, even if it's something like a video game level. Not only that, but it gives the feeling that you respect their choices.",

            "commentText": "\"Kids shouldn't be forced to do anything that makes them uncomfortable.\"\n\nProbably the most harmful advice you can give (if the advice is general). Obviously there's a point where this holds true, but you can't always avoid doing something uncomfortable or don't like. You won't get anywhere in life if you just stay in your comfort zone. Additionally, getting your kids into the mindset that they can will raise them to be close minded, because different opinions can be uncomfortable to confront.\n\nI'm not sure if you shouldn't tell your kids to hug grandma or not though. I haven't really had any experience with that.",

Instead \"That's wonderful\" is a far better statement.\n\n\nOne that was missed in the video \"Let it go\"... no, not because of the song. When a child is having a problem, and they come to you for advice, or for help, \"let it go\" is very dismissive of that problem. The reason, is because if it was a simple matter of \"letting go\" they wouldn't be having the problem in the first place. They came to you for help, because they are having difficulties letting go. DON'T BE DISSMISIVE OF YOUR CHILD'S PROBELMS!",

Dont compare them to others, not in a positive or negative way, it hurts or inflates self esteem. Dont downgrade how they feel, especially if they have attempted to do something drastic (an example is suicide). And dont bring your kids into your own problems..an example is , dont talk about how horrible their dad is when they are still in contact with said dad, another example is when you get in a fight with your boyfriend, dont turn to your kid and ask them their opinion. And dont FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SAY \"ITS JUST A PHASE\" BECAUSE IT MIGHT NOT BE AND IT COULD MAKE IT EMBARRASSING FOR THEM",

            "commentText": "\"your child will grow up knowing that everything is in their own hands\" no, its not. There are hundreds of thousands of millions of things in this world that we cannot control, please make sure that your child is aware that they have the power to change things for themselves but are aware that there are some things that you just can't control, this will help them to know themselves better and know how to deal with situations in which normally they wouldn't have confidence. However, you should also make sure that you know how to explain it will to them; saying something such as \"you can't control [insert this that and the other]\" will make them lose confidence in them selves, on the other hand, saying \"you can control anything within your reach\" places restrict on what your child believes that they can do for themselves. try explaining with things they understand, for example \"honey, there are some things you can control, like when you give in your homework, or where you put your papers, but remember there are things that you can't control too, like what time the bus gets here, or how strong the wind is in the morning.\" if they are really young then start with simpler things like,dropping something on the floor or spilling things. remember parents, that for your children, you are who they look up to and take advice from, so it s important to tell your kids these things even when they are older.",

            "commentText": "I'm calling BS on \"Good Job!\". My dad grew up drawing amazingly realistic portraits and I developed a similar knack for art as well. My dad gave me a lot of pointers on human anatomy, shadows, etc. Whenever i showed him a drawing, though, he almost never told me \"good job\" and instead would critique and ask about why i went for certain stylized aspects (\"what made you choose the big eyes [for an anime drawing]\", \"why did you go for that color scheme?\", etc.) Maybe it was just his tone, but instead of raising my self esteem, it made me second guess everything i did. It can depend on the child for sure, but i always just wanted to hear a \"good/great job!\". Maybe instead of jumping right to the details, you can establish \"wow! Good job! I like how you did (insert action/detail) to get your result!\" Praise, then critique. After establishing that you like the result, then you can work on construction. Jumping straight to \"what made you choose this plan of action\" can cause your kid to start second guessing instead of having confidence in their plans",

I am specific on what I am referring to, and try not to make a blanket statement.  It is something that you really have to put yourself in their shoes and remember how it felt to be their <b> age.</b>  I try.  I think I did something right, because my oldest kids that are on their own call me every day.  I don't expect it, I'm just thrilled that they want to talk to me on their own accord.  My youngest is 17, and it's so hard to see her go through heartbreak... and often she doesn't want to share why she's so upset.  I just let her know I'm there.  They don't necessarily want unsolicitated advice when they are in emotional pain.  When she's come and thrown herself in my arms, howling from heartbreak, I just hold her.  Whether or not she chooses to tell me what's up is of little importance.  Knowing that she can just be comforted by her mom without being questioned is very important I think.  I may be right, because she does still come to me and it's ok to not have to talk.  I THINK I'm giving her what she needs from me.  I know that is what I'm trying to do with every ounce of my being.",

A lot of things from this video and a few others that BrightSide has as well are very true. I'm 26 and have experienced a lot of the things I keep seeing here. Abuse is abuse is abuse, whether psychological, emotional, or physical. And it doesn't just have to be laying their hands on you to be physical either. Physical abuse is cornering or blocking exits physically with their body like a parent towering over you when yelling at you. Calling you names and belittling is just as much verbal abuse as cussing at you is. And that is NOT okay. If you have an adult you trust I would like to encourage you to talk with them about this please. Any form of abuse causes trauma and lasting effects long into someone's life. Your feelings are valid, ALL of them. Whether you're upset, happy, confused, excited, whatever it may be. Humans are expressive. We're supposed to be. All of these forms of abuse though just make us want to hide it all until we explode :( and that's not right.",

Since parents work to support their children, it makes me feel like \"maybe they wouldn't have as much problems if I didn't come along\".\nAlso, it's understandable that parents have struggles like us teenagers/children, but randomly saying things like that instantly put down a good mood. As well as mistakening a joyful little moment in their life as getting a negative response (I made a nice drawing in my style and my parent first complained that the eyes were too big).\nAlso saying that you're overreacting can damage <b> mental </b>health and behavior, it makes me love my quiet and solitude, 'cause then I wouldn't be bothered and be judged or pressured or asked abOUT EVERYTHING I DO (sorry) and this is why I'm pretty much only awake at night.\nLast, unappreciatedness\nUsually smart teens are constantly pressured in school once their talents show, they are expected to be the best, they don't care about how well you did in one subject, it becomes so<b>  common</b> it isn't impressive anymore. They just care and complain about what you did wrong, not only does it unnecessarily pressure and damag<b> e menta</b>l health, it made me stop showing my success.\nTwo reasons:\nFear of negativity because style and subject is barely understood\nNot being noticed enough because, always busy and because they are already familiar with this talent\n\n\nSo in conclusion:\nAppreciate your kids more",

And here's the best part; even if they do tell you that you're \"pretty great\" when they're in the mood to like you and be nice to you and aren't ranting about how much of a mistake you are, you can't take the compliment/encouragement because you don't believe they're being sincere, or your own self-esteem has gotten so low that you believe it's a complete lie, and that's how you develop impostor syndrome, among other things.",

I know that some of the listed phrases can be annoying but I don't entirely agree with all of them. Take for example number 1. If my parents told me they were proud of me for something i wouldn't have been happyer. When they praise me it motivates me to do even better the next time. They do have high expectations for me and it really can get exhausting at times but I personally think that's the way of achieving things in life. I believe that people should always try harder and strive to become a better version of themselves. So in conclusion it really depends on the personality and way of thinking of the child. Parents can just try to understand them better and support them any way they can.",

I know my case doesn't apply for everyone, since every person is different, but as a child, \"I'm proud of you\" was one of my favorite phrases to here from my parents. It didn't make me feel pressured in the slightest.\n\nI'd say the same for the point about \"You're incredible at this\". Sure, the experiment might have revealed that children with low self-esteem chose easier pictures because they were afraid of not doing so well the next time, but why ignore the fact that those with a higher self-esteem chose a harder one? I think in cases like this, there's no size that fits all. Rather, the key is for each parent to understand their teen's personality, and treat them accordingly.",

They should all be encouraged to reach their potentials.\n\nI think maybe a better statement than \"I'm so proud of you\" might be \"I'm so proud of the way you thought this out!\" or \"I'm so proud of the way you made this happen!\"  That still conveys parental pride but keeps the focus on the child's effort and leaves the door open for a different assessment next time, so no undue pressure for the next task.",

I used to sleep perfectly fine, but now ever since my sisters came along I couldn't get any sleep. My mom think it is funny, but she never actually understood because she is the youngest out of her sisters.",

Those seemingly simple words have a HUGE impact, and not in a bad way. \n\nI remember that 3 years ago, my mother told me for the very first time that she was proud of me, and I broke down. In 14 years, everything I showed her, everything I told her, everything I did never created that response. \n\nSure, a psychological study might suggest you don't say it at all. But my advice is that you should say it at specific moments, not for every little thing your child does (as that makes it worthless), but say it at least. Please.",

I feel like this really shouldn't be a problem phrase so long as you establish that you do love them outside of said achievements.\n\nDespite the fact that I don't think my mother ever said those words as far as I remember, I never feel like I have to \"earn\" her approval because she doesn't treat me differently for achieving something-- or failing to. Meanwhile, my largely-absent workaholic father said \"I'm proud of you\" twice only after I did certain things and it made me develop an unhealthy relationship with said thing (in this case, grades and writing) that ruined both my enjoyment of said thing AND made me feel even more insecure about how much my father cared about me. Then I snapped out of it, because chasing approval is tiring LOL\n\nThe last point I think is missing out on context on what makes the phrase potentially problematic. What should be avoided is using it as a \"reward\" for certain behavior while withholding affection in all other times, methinks.",

My dad always only said 'I love you' and/or 'I'm proud of you' when I did something great, like aced a final, got straight A's, won a competition, etc. Sometimes he would even use it to reward me for overworking myself, like staying up till 4am for homework, or turning down invites to things to study instead. So whenever he said 'I'm so proud of you,' I did indeed feel like I had to perform well, sometimes seemingly impossibly well, for him to love & be proud of me. Now I know better than to let that affect me so much, but it did cause a lot of unnecessary pressure and stress as a teen",

But I think along with telling them that you're proud of the behaviors, it helps to reinforce that the child should feel proud of themself when they've accomplished something. That way the sense of pride is internalized and encourages good self-esteem. The feeling will come from within, versus just being dependent on external compliments and judgement. So don't just express your pride, make sure they understand that it is their had work that they too should be proud of. Instead of a blanket statement, say if they earned an A, praise their good study habits and diligence, and let them know that they should feel that pride on their own, not just because it makes mom & dad happy...\n\nSaying \"good for you\" just sounds so disinterested.",

Yah same, when I was in High school, I had difficulty in Math during the whole 5 years of my HS (my parents insisted that I go in enriched math to open more doors for me in the future). In my two last years, Ive had one or three grades above 75%. My mom was proud but that much while my dad would always point out that I still had to have that much % to pass my class. \nConsidering that the teacher did tell them that enriched math was really hard (and that for a while after they SEEMED to understand the level of difficulty better) and that I failed most of my math exams, I think a little more encouraging and comprehension would've been good :')",

I'm not sure if it's just me or if others teens feel the same but because I'm so belittled I dont trust my parents anymore and I refuse to tell them anything. I suffer from low self esteem and I'm ridiculed for it and in a night half my ENTIRE family knows what I did. I grew up wanting the approval of my parents until I got bullied and went around hanging my head. I was told that I was okay and it really made me feel like i was being over dramatic. I HATE every single phrase listed here because it reminds me of how I'm treated at home.",

Maybe you guys would get respect back if you respected them. Respect is a two way street. You guys are complaining about not getting respected but are you really respecting your parents? Are you respecting their rules? Are you respecting when they ask you to do something? Are you respecting when they say no that means no? Respecting your parents has so many levels and if you're not respecting them how do you expect them to respect you? Yes they make comments sometimes that may be over the line. Parents are human too. But haven't you done the same before? Maybe try respecting your parents and see how they react. I'm only 16 btw and this is how I feel about it.",

A lot of people twist religion into a mind control rather than a way of life and redemption from sins for the soul. I grew up always being told \"the bible says you have to respect me because im older/your parent\" but people who quote religious texts for their own good tend to dismiss the parts they dislike. There's a verse in the bible that says parents do not trouble your children (not quoted kinda pataphrased). My older brother printed it out at school and taped it on our fridge. He got grounded for 2 months for being disrespectful enough to question authority. Which totally misses the entire point of Christianity. And same goes for any other religion. Study your book if you're going to quote it. Because if you dont you ruin your own image and the image of your religion. I dont know much about the muslim religion but i do believe that there's a lot more to it then what media says and that a mutual respect of all people regardless of <b> age </b>shouldn't be just specific to your beliefs religious or not but rather an act of human decency that shouldnt have to be stated.",

Like yeah if they do somthing real bad hey need to be punished and yeah take their phone for a while, but don't threaten them with every thing they don't want to do with 'I'll take your phone away'. You won't get up in time for school? No phone then. You didn't clean the bathroom? No phone. Don't eat all your dinner? No phone. Fight with a sibling? No phone. Like even if you just threaten it and don't actualy take it away it creates a feeling of uncertainty and paranoia that if they ever make you mad they'll get their phone taken away. Honestly I can't even leave my phone in my room cause I feel like It'll disappear somehow with how much my parents threaten to take it or turn off the WiFi. It's such an unreasonable paranoia, like they've never just randomly taken my phone,  there's always yelling first but it still makes me super unconfterble when it's not on my person now..",

All of those questions the narrator proposes to say instead could be seen as an interrogation or criticism by a kid that is not used to it. I know this because I have a very vivid memory of showing my teacher a 'book' I made in kindergarten. I was used to receiving praise for my writing, so when my kindergarten teacher kept on asking questions, I got upset and angry because I thought she didn't believe I wrote it. It really felt like an interrogation of a suspected thief to me!",

It was my first time there and their idea of \"seeing everything\" was to spend a couple of seconds at each sight and move on. \nI just wanted to slow down and appreciate what's in front of me at my own pace instead of the fast pace of my folks.\nSometimes a fast pace life can steal away important thinking and growing opportunities for children, me thinks.",

I see these videos setting kids up for failure with real life because I see all these comments on how everyone is a victim because of terrible parents.  Wait until all these victims get a job with a boss or join the military.  This kind of video makes victims and as I see in comments makes them blame others for all their problems.  These videos are harmful and weaken character of kids and encourage people not to take personal responsibility.  Parents love their kids and none are perfect, and no kid is perfect.  Any kid that thinks they have bad parents because they are guiding them, then why even have parents, go get a job and go alone and quit crying because you are mistreated.",

Of course it's important to not make a kid feel like their prestations are not their own, and it's important to let them know you'll still love them if they make mistakes, but not letting them know you're proud of them is not the solution. And the specific phrase \"Good for you\" is ABSOLUTELY not the solution.\n\nTo me, the solution is telling your kid how proud you are of them when they do something right, while still giving them constructive criticism and helping them improve. Ask them questions about what they're doing, give them feedback, and tell them you're proud of them. When they're not doing well, help them overcome their mistakes and help them prevent it from happening the next time. Do not get mad at them for making the mistake, just help them to get over it. This way, the kid is still in charge of what they do, but they know how you feel about it without not feeling loved or anything like that. They will rather be encouraged to improve and learn.\n\nWhat do you think is the best way to deal with this problem?",

I recently became Editor in Chief for a literary magazine, and have had art and lit published, and literally all I've heard from them is \"Good\". It's so agonizing as a teenager. You constantly want to make the most important people in your life proud of you, you want to show them how you've grown and all the things you've achieved; but all you get is a \"Good\" or a \"Good for you\".",

Personally, as a child, \"I'm proud of you\" was one of my favorite phrases to here from my parents. It didn't make me feel pressured in the slightest. It actually made me feel good. It encouraged me to keep up the good work, and reminded me that my parents really care about my achievements. It really encouraged me to know that my actions had a positive impact on them.\n\nSaying that you're proud of your children is a very positive thing. In fact, I remember one time when my grandmother told my mom she was proud of her. My mom started crying. She got so emotional because my grandma had never told her that before. It really meant so much for my mom that her mother was proud of her. And that was happened when I was about 17, so imagine that. I feel lucky that my parents have always been open about telling me when they're proud of me. I can't imagine how bad it must feel that you try your best to make your parents proud of you, but not ever getting it. When growing up, your parents are your greatest role models. They're the most important people in your life, and you really want them to see everything you've achieved, how much you've grown. Getting that recognition is something very important for children.",

Look how absolutely stunning she is!\" Because it makes me feel like they wish I looked better \n-im not sure how to explain this one but I was talking about possible career options with my mom and she would say things like \"No that's not a good job choice it doesn't pay well and you'll live on the streets\" I think you should instead support them on their interests and don't discourage them about making it as an adult if you wouldn't want them in a certain career for absolute certain then lightly ask about other interests and don't directly state that their choice is bad because everyone changes careers and it's normal to want to explore what you want to do in life and plan your future",

Growing up is a hard process so why avoid the hardships? You learn from mistakes and after you're a teen, you're an adult so they need to learn that life isn't always fair but your family (I hope!) loves you. If you surround yourself in the what some would call babying it's harder to get out of that shell. I'm not saying babying is bad, just little kids should get that more because they need to be protected just as much as teens and sometimes that helps.",

I will say though, eventually it just becomes a habit, maybe it's because I only see my grandma once a year, I'm bigger on thinking people should show their grandma affection, but I guess the kids shouldn't think of it as being forced, rather doing their Grammy a favor, even then it feels (in my opinion) 'rude-ish' to think of showing your grandma love as something like a chore. Any way if they don't kiss their grandma, I'd hope they give them a hug, at least.\n\nThis is just my opinion and I don't really want to start any arguments but I see why a kid wouldn't want to kiss Grammy but as a kid with all of his grandparents 'gone' except one, I think it would be smart to let her know how much you appreciate her.",

Do you want to be alone? Yeah right?  Therefore when I ever someone crying with a bunch of people asking what's wrong. Some say 'Go away!' To others. And they don't leave either! Now when I see my friends hurt or crying I say 'Okay. When I'm crying I want to be alone. So I'll leave you alone. Only if you want me to stay I'll stay.'

Not everyone is smart, or pretty, etc etc. And I myself, I would never make it into the \"nerd class.\" I'm a utter failure at a lot of things, but compared to a lot of the kids at my school, I'm excellent at art. (meaning I'm pretty much useless in this world, but whatever I guess.) Even then, I'm a piece of trash in art. XD",

He started non-violent protests in India to give the Indians what they wanted, for example: the Salt March in 1930. Gandhi became a respected leader, and a hero in 1947, when India was finally freed from Great Britain. But Muslims went to Pakistan while Hindus, including Gandhi, stayed in India. Gandhi wanted all religious people to live in harmony, but some didn't like that and killed him in 1948. He is remembered as a hero.",

They know it IS usually a phase, but you are right, it doesn't help the teen. Parents should make the effort not to say it out loud (tho they may be thinking it) and talk to and and be there for the teen. My son is 41. I have had to stand back many times and just let him go through it. Maybe that's the important thing - to recognize that the feelings, etc are serious and real for the person who is in the middle of them and not to belittle the person for having them.",

In a multi-child family not to tell a younger child that their older sibling would never do something that they did, behave a different way or not show interest in a better performance. It cuts to the quick because every child is so very different, even in the same family. I had great parents but was told that on more than one occasion and too many times to count at school as my older brother was a super achiever. It's downright demeaning and hurts the childs self confidence.\n\nP.S. : It is not only okay but so very empowering to tell your child that you're proud of them as long as you explain why! It reinforces good behavior and is another way of telling them that you love them, without embarrasing them by over using those words. And yes, you should always tell your children that you love them. Just don't over do it or it'll lose its' impact and credulity (ie.\"believability\", as it were).\n\nHonestly, how could you miss those?",

My mum has a high standard set for me, I get up before her by choice, make my own breakfast, the night before I make sure everything is ok and I will tell mum if I need something ironing(she doesn't let me iron) and I have a routine every morning. I've never been late for school thanks to my routine but mum has her clock upstairs set five minutes early so when she yells, \"Its half past, hurry up we should be out the door by now!\" Its twenty past and I'm ready. So thank u for uploading this video, all the things on this list annoy me, especially the wi-fi one, I have no other kids in my area and am an only child which means when my parents tell my, play a board game, I can't, when they tell me to draw, I can't lookup pictures and I don't have picture books.",

I would think a healthy balance of 'good job' 'I'm proud of you' 'great work' would be perfect in a child's life. My oldest is learning how to drive. The first time I took him out I told him that I was impressed on how well he did and that I was proud of him for handling driving with maturity. I don't see anything wrong with that. However, if I tell him 'Im proud of you' every time we go out driving then that's overkill. \n\nI do not like 'good for you' at all. It sounds sarcastic, like a slap in the face.",

Daughters whose dad could never tell them that they were proud of them, even on graduation day, or at their wedding, will never be able to replace that need for their father's blessing. My future mother-in-law talks about that sometimes. Everyone is different, and it's definitely important for parents to take their parenting seriously and consider how they treat their kids, even in seemingly unimportant instances. Having a relationship with your kids that allows you to ask them how you make them feel is priceless, and has far-reaching effects on their relationships with peers, their future partner, and future children of their own. \nParenting is kind of like math homework. If you feel like it's easy, you're probably doing it wrong, and you need to ask for help. \nI'm definitely starting a counseling/therapy fund for my kids when they're born--not a college fund (unless we have tons of money) but money to spend whenever they're struggling and need to understand what's going on by talking to a counselor. I needed that when I was 14, and didn't get it until my 20s. \nI just pray that I will be blessed with a husband with a good job so that I won't have to be a working mother, so that I can spend the quality time getting to know my kids and allowing them to make the mistakes they need to make in order to learn. I hope I never overburden myself with extra projects so that I no longer have time to let my kids be kids. I want to be the best mother that I can. \nMy mom does tell me she's proud of me, and it's not exactly as bland as this video states it is. After years of criticism from her and myself, I'm living alone in my own apartment out of state, dating an amazing man, and keeping up my relationship with my parents through texting and calling. There are plenty of things we need to work on, but my therapist and I are tackling them one at a time! Good for me for working a full-time job this summer for the first time in my life. Good for me for working to preserve my future marriage in the way I believe is right. Good for me for saving money where I need to, and spending it where I can't afford to suffer. Good for me for living my own life. Mom gets to tell me she's proud of me when I tell her about everything I'm accomplishing and how much better I'm doing now, and I get to have a healthier relationship with boundaries. Good for me. It's not to make her proud, it's to achieve my best self, for my own sake and the sake of those I love. I'm growing up to be me, and I'm glad I'm not completely shut off from my mom so that she can get to see it, too.\nLong rant, but these parenting tips are really good to think about. Talk them over with your kids to see how they feel about it, too!",

Switch up to \"hey that's pretty neat!\" or \"you're getting good at that!\" or something.  Its more about context than content in a lot of cases.",

Overusing a phrase can be just as bad as misusing it.  In both cases, the problem is the ambiguity that arises when its not easy to tell whether you're being sincere or not.",

Reasons why I strongly disagree with number #4 and #1 are described in two following paragraphs.\n\nI'll start with number #4. Okay, I understand it's better to focus on the way of achieving the result, rather than just saying \"Good job!\" But I don't see why you couldn't do both things - saying \"Good job!\" and then focusing on the way of achieving it. I strongly disagree with that notion you shouldn't praise your child for a good job by showing your reaction. And praising him/her is definitely not in the contradiction with focusing on the way of achieving the result.\n\nAnd now number #1. There is an even more upsetting point of view mentioned in this part of the video. Replacing the sentence \"I am so proud of you\" by saying \"Good for you!\" simply doesn't seem warm enough to me. It's almost like saying - \"You probably feel good after achieving your goal. I don't care too much but I guess you're happy.\" I know it's not directly said in this way but it almost looks like saying a stuff like that to me. I would honestly prefer saying something warmer instead - for example: \"That's really great you've achieved your goal! You must be so happy! :)\"",

Especially the \"I'm so proud of you\" one. \"Proud of what, what did I do that made you proud?\" and \"You don't mean  that\" are instantly things that go off in my sister and I's heads when we hear that from our parents. (Actually, our parents have said all these things on the Never Say List. They're not bad parents by any means, but I'm reaching that<b>  age</b> where they're less Mom and Dad and more like friends, they aren't super good friends by the looks of it and based on how I've felt about it recently. I've also had a similar experience that was extremely painful and still is that's associated with \"be the good role model for siblings\" thing. I draw to entertain myself, and the way I learn is to imitate what other people have done by adding some of their technique to my style. My mom stumbled across one of m<b> y ol</b>d school notebooks that I draw like this in and she confronted me and told me to slow down and wait for my sister to catch up- I interpreted this as \"stop because you can't be better than her, so don't try to be\"). These phrases on the list honestly hurt and I've asked kids at school about how they feel about stuff like those empty responses and they've had the same response as my sister and I did- \"they don't care, they're not listening, they're not paying attention, they dont mean it.\" So, really, DON'T say stuff like this to your teenager.  This list is pure honesty and I'm glad our opinions are getting out there. These psychologists know what they're talking about when they say we'll feel a certain way when someone else takes control, when we're put in uncomfortable situations, when our feelings are tossed aside. Raging hormones are enough to drive <b> us cra</b>zy, we don't need insecurities added to the mix. So, yeah, don't say the things on the list to your kids and teenagers- it has a negative impact. Take it from a teen.",

Im a teen as well & I wonder why they said they want to become good friends instead of like what they used to be as parents when I was a kid. Okay I get that, but what im trying to say is where is the effort for that? They dont seems like really trying to understand and being a good friend for me. Asking for solutions and discuss about problems only end up like.. the easiest way to describe is \"Just do this, im a parent, have lot of exp, i know Im right, I know your problem, my solution is the best for you\". Welp, sounds so good for a friend for me.... fk it.",

As you grow up, you'll understand - being a parent is a really nasty 24/7 job- no shortcuts and no hiding places. \nTeenagers are incredibly difficult to work with because- simply put - they know <b> nothing,</b> but think they know everything. They have no life experience , but their personality is forming and they somehow think they are the centre of the universe - so their problems are bigger than everyone else's. It's not their fault at all - it's just the way things are. In childhood they were sheltered by their parents and didn't experience hardships- now they are becoming independent and terribly sensitive about everything. (\" Don't hug me, mom, my friends will see me and laugh at me!\" - you've no idea how hurtful these words can be to a parent- suddenly realising that his / her child is ashamed of his/ her sign of affection. But, all that matters to a teenager is that some kids will laugh at him/ her). \nYou see, things are difficult on both sides. \nStill, both parents and kids need to be wise. Wisdom comes with<b>  age</b>, though, and nobody's perfect.",

                    "commentText": "naly202 thanks! I'll definitely consider at looking at proko! I've already subscribed to Jazza and I'm thrilled to have met another viewer of his, or at least someone who's researched him! \ud83d\ude04\n\nI also really like your suggestion of posting myself in videos on YouTube. I like to draw, theorize, and I'm into the other arts like singing, gaming (It's a skill as much as it can be a pain), dancing (for fun) and playing instruments, and while those are things that are great for my self esteem and effectively keep boredom at bay, it makes it very difficult to know what my channel would be centered around. If anyone has opinions, you can leave a comment...\nThere are already some videos of my sister and I online, if you search for Dana and Morgan piano recitals, the little brunette girls in front of the white keyboard on the right are my sister and I about four years ago. Also on Matt Mullin ALS ice Bucket Challenge, my sister and I did the intro for that closer to five years ago or something, all I know is it happened before we moved. \nSo, I'll definitely see if I can enter the community. I have a microphone set at home I could start with for audio and I don't know where I could get a camera... If anybody wants to be helpful in locating video cameras, if they could comment it'd be appreciated. \nSo, Thanks naly202!\n\nAs for the parent subject, again, I understand they work as hard as they can (my mom gets a teacher's salary as a paraprofessional teacher's assistant in the school Library and my dad was jobless for a year after First National Bank cut off half of their programing department in my city and I've seen how hard the two of them still work to put a roof over their daughters' heads. I mean absolitely no disrespect towards them- they're my heroes). It's just sometimes I feel there's a disconnect between myself and them,  and that phrases like the ones seen in the video this comment's connected to, are definitely a great source of confusion. I don't often feel like people are insincere, much less my parents, I just feel like they could elaborate on what they mean by \"proud\" and stuff like that, like, explain why or what we're doing right so my sister and I, and my high school classes, can keep that in mind when we face something difficult and stressful, because then we can think \"at least you're good at ________, they're proud of you for ______. They love you, you can do this.\" They shouldn't have to protect me if I need to learn a bit on my own to get by. \nI feel like some conversations can be difficult because of the sides that you pointed out. Like you said, teenagers are in their own little world, for some it might be collapsing around them and others might be only just finding out what the outside works wants from them, and those pressures can be difficult to handle of there isn't a proper emotional support system in place for us. And while some teenagers might seem at a loss for words about what they think about the world,  its because the works is <b> crazy </b>and will keep on spinning on its axis like it always does and with all the stuff going on at times, it seems daunting that another day, a harder day, will always keep coming! \nBut adults know that what life throws at you, you have to make something great of it, and to work even when you're scared of it,  whether it's to get by, keep your jobs, support a family, etc, you're on it. But that's because you learned all this, or at least, many did, when you were a teenager, too. I think the problem is that sometimes both sides forget that the other one is made up of people who have an opinion that no one can alter. Sometimes no one is right or no one is wrong because there isn't always a right or wrong. \nThis is from the perception of a teenager who knows the world doesn't revolve around her, but the human<b>  race</b> lives on it and the world doesn't revolve around the huma<b> n rac</b>e. No, the world revolves around the sun, what allowed it to live assnd support life. You adults realized that you're the earth and and you revolve around taking care of everyone and using your skills to make and sustain change. That's your sun. Teenagers like me are still reeling from the fact that we don't revolve around ourselves, that without help we can't live,  that someone's looking out for us, and we have to take care of ourselves to a certain degree to take care of others. Some of us aren't quite up to that yet. There's that disconnect, and it's found not only in needing to explain a point of praise/consolation to anyone of Gen Z, but also in perception of how the world had always been functioning, because not everybody knows that.  \n\nThat's all I can say for certain for now. I just want everyone to know I'm reading their comments and learning from them, so thanks for the reading material. I'll be sure to tell my author sister all about this and she can include some of your points in a story she just might finish.",

Especially teens are usually rebellious so forcing them to hug their grandparents could have the opposite effect. Teaching your children kindness is really great but I think it should be done very carefully and sensitively because if kids feel they're not free to decide, they'll usually go into opposition. So honestly, I definitely wouldn't force my kids to hug and kiss their grandparents. But of course, you don't have to share my point of view.",

I think this simply should be the question of their free decision. :)",

I think some teens are rebellious because they think mainly of themselves (teenage years can be very self-centered) and discard the thoughts and feelings of others. As an adult/parent, I deeply respect/respected the feelings of my parents and husband's parents. A show of love from the grandchildren means/meant so very much to them. I know this for a fact (three of them have now passed away). Teens need to be taught to think of the feelings of others and especially respect for their grandparents. Time on this earth is short; love is perhaps the most important thing.",

                    "commentText": "Kat Kristar: I can see your point, Kat and I agree with you that love is one of the most important things. Love leads to deep compassion and compassion itself can be expressed by saying kind words, kissing, hugging or helping the others, for example. So yes, a parent should teach his/her kids to sympathise with others. That means we can agree on the final goal of raising children. But on the other hand, this goal should be achieved very sensitively and the way of achieving the goal mustn't be in contradiction with children's freedom because children deserve to be respected too. In other words, I think it's not a good idea to tell your kids: \"go to hug your grandpa/grandma\" because they could feel they're under pressure. I would honestly prefer to say something which could give them the feeling of freedom instead; something like: \"your grandma will be so happy if you hug her or at least tell her goodbye\". And I honestly think this method would lead the kids to deeper compassion than just telling them something like \"hug your grandpa/grandma\". A great advantage of this sensitive method is your kids' approach - if they hug their grandparents they will do it not because they'll have to do it (they mustn't feel they have to - that\"s extremely important) but because they'll want to make their grandparents happy. :)",

I also don't see anything wrong in saying: \"I'm so proud of you!\" I wrote a comment which mentioned my point of view for number #4 and #1. I'll copy the comment for you here:\n\nIt's an interesting video and honestly, I agree with all of the thoughts except number #4 and #1. Reasons why I strongly disagree with number #4 and #1 are described in two following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nI'll start with number #4. Okay, I understand it's better to focus on the way of achieving the result, rather than just saying \"Good job!\" But I don't see why you couldn't do both things - saying \"Good job!\" and then focusing on the way of achieving it. I strongly disagree with that notion you shouldn't praise your child for a good job by showing your reaction. And praising him/her is definitely not in the contradiction with focusing on the way of achieving the result.\r\n\r\nAnd now number #1. There is an even more upsetting point of view mentioned in this part of the video. Replacing the sentence \"I am so proud of you\" by saying \"Good for you!\" simply doesn't seem warm enough to me. It's almost like saying - \"You probably feel good after achieving your goal. I don't care too much but I guess you're happy.\" I know it's not directly said in this way but it almost looks like saying a stuff like that to me. I would honestly prefer saying something warmer instead - for example: \"That's really great you've achieved your goal! You must be so happy! :)\"",

Adults who can process their emotions and use critical thinking to solve problems are more successful and happier. All of the things mentioned in the video work againt a child learning to process their emotions or deal with external pressures or problems. If you are capable of looking at your life and how you delt with problems I am sure you will find times where you would have prospered earlier or been happier longer if you had learned this stuff as a pre-teen/teen instead of as an adult.",

                    "commentText": "\"Good for you\" seems sort of patronizing to me. Of course it probably depends on the context. But if I accomplish something, like painting a landscape, I would rather the compliment actually be specific to the painting. I'm not a fan of small talk, and I wouldn't mind a little constructive criticism when necessary. But to me, just saying \"good for you\" doesn't actually answer anything. Because I'm a creative person open to improvement, I'd actually rather the praise (or criticism) be directed to the actual substance of what I did, techniques I used, color scheme, etc., which requires actually looking at the painting, instead of saying \"yay\" from the other room because I have more than a blank canvas.",

This is the best thing- especially if kids are made conscious of their duties like: choosing their clothes and putting them neatly on a chair in the evening.

Than again my mother was almost never home back than. Seeing how she was always constantly working. She was a postal worker who had a very demanding job. Where she had no choice but to work all of the time. Since her supervisors were very mean and nasty. Who didn't care at all about their workers personal life. All they care about was getting the mail out. When I come home from school. She is getting herself ready to leave for work. When I was getting ready for school in the mornings. She was still in bed sleeping. Since she didn't get done work until around midnight. And it takes her 30 minutes for her to get home. So I was always home alone with my cat and the tv. Where my super was usually one of the frozen tv dinners. My mother never really had the time to make supper.\n\nAs for number 3 that definitely was not true for me. Since the only younger siblings I have are my 2 half sisters who lived with our father. And a half brother who I didn't even knew of his existence. Until I was almost out of high school. And he lived over 1,100 miles away in Florida with his mother at the time. And I never really kiss or hug any of my relatives since they are really not the kind of people that do that.",

I've heard some of my friends parents say it to them while I was still in the area. And although it can be hurtful to the child, it's also super awkward being the role-model child, having to sit there, realizing that their parents are praising you and not their own kid. And tbh the only reason I get out in those situations is because I'm usually quiet and reserved when at a friends house and their family is there.",

Another thing I like to add is parents should never EVER say to their teen \"you're just asking for attention/acting out for attention!\" BIG NO NO! Even if they are displaying negative behavior to get attention, parents should never say this to their children's face because it will only worsen the behavior and low their self esteem. Have a disciplinary action, yes, but still listen to your child. They don't mean to act out but they are doing it because they are suffering from whatever stress is going on in their lives, and need help and guidance in dealing with their emotions. Talk to your child to get to the root of their problem and help them work it out and get thru it.",

You must be so happy! :)\"",

Just today I was thinking how overly competitive I get whenever somebody in my school or anyone my <b> age </b>or younger that I may know plays a more well known song or plays it better than I can on piano. I feel bad for them that I dont let them shine above. But I also feel like I just cant stop the habit. I just have gotten used to being compared with others \ud83d\ude15(even though it doesnt happen anymore, or that often).

Why cant you tell \"i trust you, you've done 1 & 2 in the past, you can do this too, you've shown great attention to details bla bla, and i will be there to support you\"...

This is wonderful motivation and in my experience gives you happier and healthier kids.",

Perhaps I didn't do something right by not using reverse psychology with my children, but they are loving respectful and supportive of others guess I did it wrong. If your children aren't happy having to do things now, wait till they have bosses and have to follow the law, not just rules anymore.",

And they think I've forgot about it because they forgot about it but I didn't. And when I tell them about it sooner or later, it's always the same excuses: \"I never said that, you probably heard wrong. I don't remember saying that. I was angry. Just let it go.\" But it's funny, I've accidently said some hurtful things to my mom out of anger and she was hurt and it took her a long while to forgive and let it go and my excuses weren't excusable, but if it's the other way around, it's different and I feel like my feelings aren't being taken for granted when I express them when I feel hurt and they always give excuses and tell me to let it go. It's kinda ironic. Thankfully, I've learned my lesson and watch what I say, but I wish my feelings were heard instead of ignored.",

The best gift I can offer you right now is this advice: this life you know right now is your life. Don't surrender control of it and I'm counting on you to never give up on it. This is your one chance to change the world around you and find out what your freedoms are- the moment you give up on that is the same moment you become mainstream and give up your free will... \nBe as quirky, odd, awesome, dorky, amazing, cool, and as much of an emotional wreck as you want to be, chase your dreams- whatever. Just be yourself.\nAnd that's all I have to say about that. \nI really wish someone said that to me.\nI don't know if you'll read this or if you'll care. \nBut you've got this. \nAnd whether you care or not, welcome to your teenage years. \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf82",
