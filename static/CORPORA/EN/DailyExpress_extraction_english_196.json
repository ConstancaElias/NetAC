Marxist requires the people serve the state, capitalism believes the state should serve the people.Marxism is the creed of a slave, and remember the USSR used slavery quite openly as did Mao and Pol Pot. I would say genocide, mass murder, slavery all results of Marxism would be classed as negative effects, you it appears seem to think they are positives, have you had your moral compass checked recently ? Remember Marxism preaches \"Bloody Revolution\" and the destruction not change of the old order. Yes a considerable influence but an evil influence. ",

The actions of the Suffragettes those who used terrorist methods actually put back legislation as today no government wishes to be seen to give in to violence and terrorism The violent Suffragettes actually put back legislation by their actions the Suffragists got legislation to parliament a couple of times but were defeated after they lost support due to the violent actions of the Suffragettes The actions of the Suffragettes also confirmed to many the main argument against female suffrage at the time that women were too emotional to govern.So yes the Suffragettes put back female suffrage by at least five years The idea that those who fought for universal suffrage were Marxists or socialists is not borne out when you look at the people involved Sorry you have been taken in by inaccurate socialist propaganda it is the Suffragists who have been white washed from history after 60 years of socialist interference in our education system If the Labour party consider Marxist ideas to be their own beliefs of course they are a Marxist party your argument is facile I never said we had become a Marxist nation Marx & amp;Engels said the UK would be the first Marxist nation they were wrong, but they were wrong about a great deal were wrong a great deal ",

Does he begrudge me my savings pot so I do not have to depend on the State to look after me when I need care?  Does he want all the hardworking people to spend, spend, spend so they can then rely on him and his Marxsist Government to then dictate to them where they should live, eat and how much air to breathe?  Yes, there are many scroungers and layabouts who would be happy to have every aspect of their lives dictated to by the State, so long as everything is FREE.  I wonder why people in Communist/Marxsist Countries who are 'looked after' by the State want to escape the Regimes.",
