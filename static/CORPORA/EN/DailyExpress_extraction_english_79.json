        "postText": "Speaking on his LBC show, Nigel Farage claimed the latest reprimand to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson proved the House of Commons' Speaker is incapable of being impartial and should not be representing the nation in Parliament.', 'Mr Farage said: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. It\u2019s painful.', 'I mean, let\u2019s discuss in a minute whether or not what Boris did was sexist, but who does this person think he is?', 'Is this the Messiah who\u2019s come back to correct us all and put us on the right path?', 'LBC\u2022BBC', 'It is arrogant, it is stuck up, it is full of virtue signalling and, more importantly, he again and again and again, is incapable of being impartial.', 'He clearly takes the other side of the argument. Just a few weeks ago I reported on this show a car sticker that was on the front of his range rover which said a nasty word about Brexit.', 'He\u2019s not impartial, my view is that it is time for him to be removed.', 'In a year and two days we\u2019re going to get back the independence of our nation and with it the sovereignty of people in this country and they will be represented in Parliament.', 'Surely, a sovereign Parliament back in charge of our nation\u2019s affairs deserves better than this.', 'Boris Johnson was forced to apologise to shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry after he referred to her as Baroness whatever-it-is and Lady Nugee, her husband\u2019s name.', 'Speaker Bercow interrupted the debate accusing the Foreign Secretary of name-calling and being frankly sexist.', 'He said: We do not address people by the titles of their spouses.', 'The Shadow Foreign Secretary has a name and it is not \u2018Lady-something\u2019 and it is inappropriate and frankly sexist to speak in those terms, and I\u2019m not having this in this chamber.', 'That is the end of the matter\u2026 it will not be allowed and you will be called out on it.', 'Boris profusely apologised, saying: May I crave your indulgence just to prostrate myself before you and to apologise for any inadvertent sexism or discourtesy that you may have deemed me to have been guilty of.', 'And I heartily tender my apologies to the right honourable lady opposite if she was offended by what I said. I meant no harm, Mr Speaker and I apologise unreservedly if I have offended the feelings of the right honourable lady.'",

To people like you, disagreeing with your particular view is \"treason\" but your desire to suppress opposing views is akin to treason against democracy itself. The speaker needs to be allowed to call members to order when they breach protocol as seriously as Johnson did or he would betray his duty to maintain respectful debate in the commons. Every single MP knows that you address other members of the house as \"The honourable\" followed by member, gentleman or lady though the preferred term is member. This protocol is there for a very good reason, to maintain respect for other MPs. If the speaker let Johnson's breach of protocol slip through the crack he would create a precedent for name calling in the house and soon it would be utter chaos serving <b> nobody </b>in this country. You have to make your mind up at some point.You either want a parliament with a speaker that maintains protocol to ensure to fairness on which a democratic parliament depends in order to function or you don 't want a working parliamentary democracy at all - in which case any calls from you for a \"sovereign parliament\" is null and void.",
