        "postText": "A man who was unhappy with the high quote he got from his car insurance company decided to legally change his gender to female to get cheaper insurance.', 'The 24-year-old, referred to only as David, shared his struggle with getting car insurance on Reddit, boasting that by changing his gender on paper, he managed to save nearly C$1,100 (\u00a3640) a year.', 'He told CBC.ca: \u2018I have taken advantage of a loophole. I\u2019m a man, 100%. Legally, I\u2019m a woman.\u2019', 'Earlier this year, the then 23-year-old purchased a new Chevrolet Cruze and had to get a full-on collision insurance policy.', 'When he rang up his insurer, he was quoted C$4,517 (\u00a32,630).', 'This was despite only having a minor crash and a couple of speeding tickets before.', 'Out of curiosity, David asked how much his premium would be if he was a woman.', 'In the Reddit post back in April, he wrote: \u2018The broker comes back with a quote of C$3423 (\u00a32,000). Holy f***.\u2019', 'In Canada, male drivers under 25 are required to pay more for car insurance than woman as they are statistically more likely to get into car accidents.', 'David saw this as gender-based discrimination and asked his insurance company to change his gender on paper to female, however this was denied.', 'Not giving in, David then decided to legally change his gender and get a new birth certificate and a new driver\u2019s license listing him as a woman.', 'To do this, he had to get a letter from his doctor saying he identified as a woman.', 'He initially thought it wouldn\u2019t be easy as he did not want to undergo gender reassignment surgery but it turned out he just had to tell his doctor that he wished to change his sex.', 'After submitting the necessary documents, David was shocked to see everything had gone through and he had received a new birth certificate, which listed his sex as female.', 'He said: \u2018I was quite shocked, but I was also relieved,\u2019 he said. \u2018I felt like I beat the system. I felt like I won.\u2019', 'By going through the whole changing process, David managed to save himself C$91-a-month (\u00a353) on his car insurance.', 'He admitted to CBC that one of the main factors for legally changing his sex was to get cheaper car insurance but that it was not the sole reason.', 'When it comes to annual earnings in Canada, women earn 66.7 cents for every dollar earned by a man, according to the Canadian Women\u2019s Foundation.', 'This mean a woman on average salary would earn nearly C$17,000 less than a man on average salary of C$51,000 (\u00a329,700) each year.",

On account that he still has that dangly bit between his legs and therefore not female despite what his legal documentation says. Either that, or the insurers go all sexist and say the accident was his fault because he's a <b> woman.</b>Insurers *always* look for the tiniest excuse not to pay out and start fighting tooth and nail with that excuse.",

It's not a matter of a physical perceived <b> gender </b>imbalance, that doesn't matter, but in the affidavit it was stated that they live as a female only. It is clear that they do not, they even state \"I'm a man. 100 percent\". Making a mockery of a legal document is rarely viewed as a bit of fun by the legal profession. I wonder which prison they'll put them in.",
