        "postText": "'The party has long had a sketchy grasp of economics but we thought at least that, maybe more than any other party, Labour was predicated on fairness, and a commitment to absolute equality.', 'Not if you're Jewish it seems. Four times last night Jeremy Corbyn refused to apologise as he was hung, drawn and quartered by Andrew Neil in a brutal TV interview.', 'Today his bid to misdirect the electorate from genuine fears over the open anti-semitism rearing its filthy head in Britain once more thanks to elements in the Labour Party failed.', 'Good.Let 's all keep our eye firmly on the ball on this one. It's too important to leave alone.', 'A Corbyn aide had downloaded a classified Government document from online gossip site Reddit and the party attempted shamelessly to shift the agenda from damning antisemitism to unsubstantiated claims about the NHS.', 'It was shameful politicking.Made shockingly worse by Labour MP Barry Gardiner 's fury that assembled journalists had the temerity to ignore the document and and go straight on with question after question about the party's antisemitism.', 'How dare they use the hastily-assembled press conference to have a dig at the poor old Labour leader, he raged.', 'They weren 't having a dig Barry \u2013 they were voicing the nation's concerns, actually fears, that something hideous we thought had been eradicated from these shores for good was back with a vengeance, thanks largely to your party.', 'And, yet again, Mr Corbyn \u2013 a man who could be feasibly be Prime Minister in two weeks - yet again failed signally to say sorry to Jewish people in Britain.', 'The words are simple Jeremy \u2013 give these a go: We in the Labour Party are deeply sorry to Jewish people in Britain for knowingly, and with tacit approval, allowing antisemitism to fester in our midst.', 'We will track down any Labour Party member who has tweeted, Facebooked or conveyed any antisemitic message in any way and ban them from the party and inform the police.', 'There, that wasn 't too hard was it?', 'Until recently Britain had a proud tradition of fighting antisemitism.Just around the corner from this building is Cable Street where a rag - tag but effective group of anti - fascists faced down the black - shirted Nazis of Oswald Mosley.', We did whatever we could during the war and in the immediate aftermath to somehow help Jewish families cope with the incomprehensible horror of Hitler's holocaust.And we firmly believed never again.', 'Which is why it is similarly incomprehensible that British Jews are now fearful of their own countrymen and the chief Rabbi feels the need to address the leader of the opposition before matters spiral even further out of control.', 'It 's time to man-up and be honest Mr Corbyn. Either admit you are the antisemite your critics accuse you of being or drain the swamp of the Labour Party racists once and for all.' , 'Unlike Brexit you really don't get to sit on the fence on racism.'",

Corbyn did not even have the grace to remain in the chamber to hear their grievances, he left.   No wonder those Labour MP's looked for other avenues to continue their political careers.",
