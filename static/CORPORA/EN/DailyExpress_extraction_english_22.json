        "postText": "Piers Morgan struggled to keep his cool on today\u2019s Good Morning Britain, as he took on the actress who plays Nicola Rubinstein in Coronation Street.', 'Nicola recently wrote a column for Metro.co.uk which spoke about inappropriate photography on red carpets.', 'Nicola argued that the language used within articles online such as flashed the flesh and busty display, is toxic.', 'ITV\u2019s morning show brought former News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis to counter her points.', 'Nicola explained: I don\u2019t wear it so people notice me. I\u2019m on a red carpet because I was up for Best Newcomer at the British Soap Awards.', 'Piers countered: I get called \u2018fat and useless\u2019 all the time, so what\u2019s the difference?', 'But Nicola agreed: I don\u2019t think there is a difference, let me just say-', 'No, let me just say, Piers cut in.', 'But Susanna dove in to give Nicola her say: No, let Nicola finish!', 'Women can be sexist as well, Nicola continued.', 'Despite Susanna\u2019s protests, Piers continued to talk over Nicola, causing her to plead: Please let me finish, Piers.', 'Neil eventually weighed on in the topic, asking: Are you sure you\u2019re in the right profession?', 'But Nicola then began shouting over Neil, as Susanna and Piers attempted to allow him to have his say.', 'As the debate descended into chaos, Neil continued: The reason that Nicola goes on the red carpet is absolutely straight forward: she goes on the red carpet to publicise her career.', 'Piers furiously jumped in once more, saying: \u201cWhat about Aidan Turner?', 'Why is it fine for women to drool over him ? ', '', '', 'It isn\u2019t fine for women to do it.', 'It\u2019s the language they use, and it\u2019s their body, it\u2019s their choice.', ' But Neil continued to disagree, saying that it was good promotion for her. ', 'Later on in the show Susanna asked Piers if he had anything to apologise for, to which he replied : No.",
