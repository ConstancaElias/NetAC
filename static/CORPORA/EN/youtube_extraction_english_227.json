IQ is not actually an accepted standard of measurement when it comes to judging an individuals intelligence, it's impossible to create a test that would be able to accurately (or even close) measure what we believe is 'brain power'. This is because we largely do not understand the brain. Scientists do not understand intelligence or the brain or an exact correlation between these two. The same way i assume you largely do not understand things such as book learnin', math, and what the big scary <b> yel<b> low<b>  </b</b</b>>>ball in the sky is that keeps you awake during the day time.

Good luck getting a job with no address.  Next point. The well fare industry the well fare industry is worth around 10 billion a year of your tax payer dollars channeled into just the job agency industry and they dont fund hardly anything anymore for the unemployed people just more and more job agencies . Job agencies were made to appease the feminist movement.  Job agencies are  women workers only businesses. And you blame the unemployed for there own fate you are so wrong its the governments fault for creating a massive well fare state. There is a average 17 unemployed people to 1aussie job.The government needs to cut every one off the wellfare payments and create a mass amount of jobs dont listen to the media.  The medias job is to ensure that there is a wellfare state to DIVED AND CONQUER rich vs poor. white v <b> black </b>religion v religion and the media is winning big time. They fooled good people like yourself to think the youth is useless. The greatest myth ive ever herd from the media is that there is inter generational unemployment. Mass unemployment never existed in the 70s and 80s. the vision of  the media is to create inter generational unemployment",

I never said otherwise.  There are however, people working.  How did they get the work?  Get qualified, get work experience, get the job, perhaps start at the bottom AND turn up everyday, on time for work and for goodness sake actually work hard. (knew an Aboriginal liaison officer who was supposed to give a lecture to government officers and he actually went walkabout for two weeks.  What a wanker.  He single handedly taught an entire batch of government officials what Aboriginals were like).    Look around, there are people who will do the jobs no one else will and work their way up.  Many work part time/casual and do 2 or 3 jobs.  Gone are the day when you could quit one job and walk into a full time job the very next day.  I understand that.  In fact, the unions won so many rights for the workers in Victoria that all the jobs have gone overseas.  That sucks but Australia has no choice but to compete internationally with the world.  We can't keep borrowing either or we will end up like Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain etc broke and paying just interest on the loans.  There is no more money on tap.  Keep arguing for sitting one your hands and doing <b> nothing </b>but complaining and guess what you'll fall even further behind.  No brain surgeon (and I'm not one) is ever out of work and he/she can work anywhere in the world.  Welcome to the real world of today.  ps You do know don't you that Aboriginals get MORE than the rest of us don't you?  Aboriginals can access the Aboriginal ONLY Aboriginal Housing Victoria to move to where there is work so stop making excuses please.

I'm sorry that your virgin ears cant take the truth without getting upset you petty little liberal engine who could. And im not white wtf lmao. Dont you see my hand. I'm about as fucking Mexican as the word frijolero itself. And even if I was how dare you criticize another individual based on his beliefs and his color of his skin. You do know that's <b> racist.</b> When have i been<b>  racist</b> here or said sum<b> n racis</b>t?. Facts are facts. When someone colonized new land sodomization of women and murder of boys and men is 100 percent what happens 100 percents of the time even in recent years it's still like that. It is the main first steps in taking over a new area to prevent rebellions and civil wars. How fucking stupid can you be? Just accept history for what it is and stop being a sentimental whiny bitch it do<b> es nothi</b>ng for the progress of humanity.  There is legit in my mind nun you can say back... like dont even reply you lost point blank period ...blaming my \"lack of intelligence\" on skin color or beliefs rather than arguing with me by proving facts and stuff...yea you lost just by saying that. Shows who you are in life you know. Not being able to have a full mind accepting truths as they come and putting yourself in your own fantasy...bye y<b> our d</b>umb and probably will always be. Gonn be one <b> them</b> old ladies that like thinks she is so smart but the children around you, gonn be like<b>  thi</b>s hag just wont shut up. And read my words as If I'm talking. That's how I talk. Dont even talk about grammar this is legit a comment. I write perfect fucking intellectual essays dont go there it's my damn specialty believe it or not sweetheart.\n\n\n\nEdit: I hate calling you names it makes me feel bad. But it is what it is ya know. Shouldn't of called me a white supremacists \ud83d\ude01...but yes dont take my comment personally please I been arguing with my girl latley and she is now ignoring me. Im Not a lil bitch ya  know im just pretty fucking mad and upset right now and I didnt do shit to her so idk...",
