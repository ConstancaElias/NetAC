        "postText": "Brighton has brought the glam and glitter in the most spectacular way as thousands celebrated LGBTQ rights.', 'Britney Spears fever has well and truly given the UK\u2019s biggest Pride celebration a world stage to shout about its campaigns, organisers said.', 'The pop star is the headline act at this year\u2019s Pride and will take to the stage later tonight.', 'Hundreds of thousands of people descended on the city to watch a parade before partying at some of the many street parties.', 'The event\u2019s managing director, Paul Kemp, said: \u2018There are still 72 countries where it is illegal to be LGBTQ, people are still persecuted for who they are.', '\u2018So we have an opportunity when the world is looking at Brighton Pride to get that message across on an international stage.', '\u2018Britney is a massive icon, everyone knows a Britney song. We are incredibly excited to have her here.', '\u2018She has a huge show coming with her, something like 20 backing dancers, so it\u2019s definitely the biggest show Brighton Pride will have seen. It\u2019s going to be an amazing show.\u2019', 'In April the 36-year-old was awarded the Glaad vanguard award for promoting equality and being an \u2018ally\u2019 for gay rights.', 'Britney fever hit the city as soon as news emerged earlier this year that she was due to perform. A video which celebrated her arrival by paying homage to her dance routines outside the city\u2019s landmarks has gone viral online.', 'Brighton-based choreographer Andrea Walker, who runs the 201 Dance Company in London and put together the routine, said she is a \u2018massive\u2019 Britney fan and described her as an \u2018inspirational figure\u2019.', 'On Tuesday, organisers dismissed online rumours that she had cancelled her performance by responding with a tweet which said: \u2018Utter nonsense, she\u2019s on her way.\u2019', 'For the first year, music acts will also perform on the Sunday including Nile Rodgers with Chic, Jess Glynne and Gabrielle.', 'Hundreds of volunteers and staff will be working over the weekend at the event which brings an estimated \u00a318 million into the city and around 2% of its total annual visitors in one day.', 'Organisers are hopeful of raising at least \u00a3500,000 for charity too.', 'Around 900 extra police, including armed officers, are expected to be on patrol at this year\u2019s event, according to organisers. Road blocks have been put in place around the city, police said.', 'In the wake of anti-transgender protesters attending London Pride last month, organisers and police have said they will respect the right to peaceful protest but would take action if any behaviour causes distress, disrupts the event or puts people\u2019s safety at risk.', 'Mr Kemp said: \u2018We don\u2019t want the message of Pride to be diminished so we will take action if needed.', '\u2018Armed police will be on patrol and barriers will be in place. I think people are accustomed to these measures. It\u2019s about keeping people safe.', '\u2018We also urge people to take their own measures too \u2013 it\u2019s going to be very hot so drink plenty of water and wear lots of sunscreen.\u2019', 'A Sussex Police spokesman said officers would be working to minimise disruption, prevent crime and keep people safe during the event, adding: \u2018Sussex Police fully supports people\u2019s rights to demonstrate peacefully.', '\u2018We must balance people\u2019s right to protest peacefully, against the disruption and alarm it may cause to the event in the city.\u2019",

We're not allowed to be proud!Organising a straight pride event is in fact impossible. It has been attempted before but the backlash from t<b> he <b> g</b</b>>ay community was so great the authorities prevented the event from going ahead. Because you know...equality.It's not permitted by society to be proud of being heterosexual, white or male because one of the other sexualities, races or genders would be offended or feel oppressed but it's perfectly acceptable for others to publicly display their \"pride\" at something they have absolutely no control over.Simple fact is if equality is what we are seeking then we have to treat all sexualities, races and genders exactly the same and although there has undoubtedly been terrible things done in the past the way to create equality is not to switch first and second place around...it's to put every one in first place.",
