It's important to do it though.  The lonely <b> elderly </b>people in this film are just examples, they are a drop in the ocean.  In your community right now, there will be people like this.  Alone, struggling.  We can all help though.  A visit, a kind word, a favour.  Offer to tidy their garden, take in their shopping, ask if they need anything fixing, chat to them for 5 minutes.  All very simple things we can all do with very little effort, but things like this make a huge life-changing difference to these people.  Look out for each other.",

Until nowadays my aunts and uncle would take turns taking care of her. They did what they can as son and daughters. Honestly I'm happy seeing my grandmother like this. She's happy surrounded by company. My paternal grandparents are doing fine. My youngest aunt and her family lives together with them. I'm happy that both sides of the family takes care of their parents well. \n\n\nBut then I look at myself, the eldest son of the family. No jobs to support myself. Living paycheck to paycheck through making arts. I'm afraid that I can't support my parents when they're <b> old </b>and retired. I have siblings. Two are working and another is studying to become an engineer. I still feel shame that my contribution to my parents aren't enough, that I'm hoping my siblings would help.",

This sense of loneliness and strangeness that may lead to depression later on.

I have failed so much to forget who I love I could not forget anyone before I was so lonely and depressed for five years I lost a lot of time I could not graduate from the university until this moment I changed my specialist very much without benefit Even after I got out of depression I feel like I'm out of death  Or I was born again I want to return to the pre-death of my grandmother I want to make up all the days that I missed without talking to her or squared for things stupidly useless. Sometimes I remember those little moments and the largest of the microscope and then ask myself why I did it I should not have done what I did.  Oh my dear grandmother, I am very sorry for all the bad happened in order for me or anyone else to apologize to every<b>  elderly</b> person in the universe or rather to anyone who was subjected to abuse I am sorry that you suffered so how I wish you would accept my sincere apology and tell my dear grandmother that it was in heaven really accept my apologies and greetings and kisses  Warm.",

The first time when I was 24 and my first marriage broke down, but I had a four year <b> old </b>daughter so technically I wasn't alone I suppose.  There was one week when in 7 days I only had 24 hours company, but that was at the beginning of the week when I had a friend overnighting.  I wasn't on the phone either and it was before the advent of mobiles.  By the end of the week I was feeling very low, and I was desperate for adult company.\n\nThe second time, when I was 50 and my second husband and I had a trial separation.  However, I was working full time, but when I got home and locked up, closed the curtains and it was just me and the TV it was cold and lonely!  So I was a relatively young<b>  woman</b> both times, so I really can't believe how these people survive.  They must be so frightened sometimes, especially in the middle of the night if they hear a noise.\n\nI am a candidate for a nursing home definitely!\n\nGod bless them!",

I message my daughter and am lucky to get a one word answer. I send her a paragraph and I get a short one word answer most of the time.  Thank God I still have my husband but he has heart and back problems and sleeps allot.  I am on the computer most of the time so I keep in touch with human beings that way.  We talked about travel when we retired but depending on your health and money situation that can be a disappointment many times.  I know that if my husband passed away, I will be one of those lonely people also.  I am in GREAT health so I can always take off somewhere and go across the USA.",

No one to have casual conversation with knowing they were once some where in the house and in my case somewhere in my heart. Painfully this situation is insoluble. You cannot escape it.

Go and see about somebody.  somebody out there would be so glad to see you.",

Time just seems to go away when you are alone. You can eat, dress, sleep whenever you want or not. Some days I never hear another voice but my pup's. I have three kids now grown and eight grandkids. Never hear from any of them. Never see them. Don't really get out much. Don't know many people where I live. Not from here. Stay inside and either sleep or sew or read a bit which puts me to sleep again. Pray for the lonely seniors out there. It's hard.",

They call when they need a sitter, that's it. My husband goes to the cottage but even when he is at home he never talks to me. My brother visits me on Saturday evening after a long hard week at work. Other than seeing people in stores he is the only one I talk to face to face. I never ever thought loneliness would be part of my life especially growing up in a large family of 11 children. I'm just not used to the silence!",

It is aged 7 years in special wood barrels!!!   God Bless JACK DANIELS!!!   My wife was only 61 when she died.  I worked my damn butt off in a factory for 35 years.  I found her dead on the sofa when I came home from work.  It was heart attack.  Curley, a dog she rescued was still in his cage, waiting to be released (every morning)  Curley was a small abused dog.  I was forced to give him away since I had to work 7 days a week.   Today, Curley runs freely in the fenced in backyard of Barb's.  Such was the legacy of my wife.   And <b> nobody,</b> I mean<b>  nobody</b> will snatch away that bottle of Tennessee Jack Daniel's whiskey!!!!  Now, that I am retired, I can reflect and toast the goo<b> d ol</b>d days!!@",

Like your dead and they ignore you. If you're walking towards them.they will turn right around and walk the other way. I tell them that I am the same color as you are, I am not a bad person. I guess all small citys and towns are like this.you have to be born ,or raised up in the area. To be excepted because they don't want out sides in.even though I am from the same state and I was born and raised in a different part of the state. When I get caught up on my bills.iam going to get in my vehicle and just drive away,some where far away were I will be treated like a human being. Not a ghost. Maybe another state in the USA. Karma will get everyone of these assholes that live in grand forks North Dakota. What comes around, goes around. These people are friendly but they will not mix with anyone that hasn't been born or raised in the era.and iam a very straight and honest person. I will only go out with women.",

I live in Florida now and have a nice little condo on the Gulf of Mexico and don't have any close friends but I do live in a good neighborhood with people who look out for one another.

They come from a generation where people didn't plan (especially women) what to do when their spouse was gone.  They assumed their children would be there for them.

Approach people if you can (NOT young women working out, unless you're female, but almost anyone else) and just LISTEN to them.  Even if you're not good at approaching, you will be approached yourself at some point.  It can be so easy that you can end up with too many people that you will feel obligations to.  And this crosses ALL <b> age </b>groups, myself as a middle aged male knowing people in their early 20's all the way into their mid-80's (with the exception of the young women mentioned above).  I interact with the connections I've made on a very regular basis.\nFAMILY-type gyms...NOT the meat-market gyms (Gold's, etc). \n\nYMCA and JCC's and similar community centers.\n\nMost seniors always welcome interaction (and are so often awesome people to know) and almost all men of all ages are absolutely fine with it as well, and most women over 35 or so, and esp older women.  And these are often very decent connections that are solid and last a lifetime, AND do often go outside of the gym environment.\n\nI have family members who can attest to the same experience.\n\nI may make a video on it.\nP.S. And obviously, use the gym to help your health.",

Other society's treat their <b> elderly </b>quite well from what I have seen . Example ! I live in Los Angeles and my grandmother died many years ago . When I go to visit her resting place I swear I am the only one in that section of the cemetery . Now you look at the Hispanic side of the cemetery since the demographics have changed in the San Fernando Valley since my grandmothers time there are families with chairs set up having picnics and that section is covered in flowers and where my grandmothers grave is at most times it is the only grave with any flowers . I know what you are thinking and I thought the same thing ! Most be more recent deaths on the Hispanic side ! I went to look myself one day and there were graves near as as<b>  old</b> as my grandmothers with flowers on them . I guess I can conclude with this . I practice what I preach ! I lost my mother about ten years ago but almost everyday on the way home from work I would call her on my cell and talk to her  . Now that she is gone I am very happy that I did . All we need to do is treat others the way you would want to be treated when your day comes to b<b> e elderl</b>y and I believe that would help solve what in my opinion is a damn shame on us !",

I live the Netherlands (forgive my bad English) and cultural differences in Europe are even bigger than in the USA. In our country people over 70 are treated as a burdan. It is quit normal that older people are send to retirement homes by their children. When they are very, very lucky their children visit them once a month. Mostly they will be forgotten. It is the same in Germany and Belgium. But in southern Europe older people lives among their familys untill they die. The most respectfull countries are the Baltic States (Latvia etc) and the countries in the East (Poland, Hungary etc). Those countries treasure their <b> elderly </b>because of their wisdom and experience. I don't know what is wrong with our culture. We are selfish and have no connection with traditional values anymore. Add the fact that we are run over by<b>  african</b> and muslim immigrants who come to profit from our social services and healthcare*, and you know that it will not turn out for the better...\n\n* as a matter of fact leftwing politicians are argueing about the fact that people over 70 with medical conditions must not be treated anymore because their ar<b> e ol</b>d already. Our health care is very expensive because all the free health care for migrants. (In our country over 400.000 migrants in the past 5 years)",

Maybe they're no longer alive . I don't know. But why not go to Church \u26ea\ufe0f or social gatherings. A place you can trust. Then hopefully you can meet nice people and not feel lonely.

A lonely person can get quite bitter and negative which perpetuates the loneliness because family end up just caring for the lonely persons essential needs rather than the emotional ones as well.

When you become older o<b> r elderl</b>y your brain still is in a state of being 25. It is shocking for <b> an elder</b>ly person to look in the mirror because they see a parent or grandparent. Yet,  their mind is as aware and awake as a 25 y<b> ear </b>old. For example, say you're 60 y<b> ears</b> old and you see a good-looking young person that makes your juices suddenly flow!  10 seconds later you realize ohmygod, I'm 40 years older than that person; what's the matter with me? The fact is, your brain is still 25 <b> year</b>s old. That is something you cannot explain to young people. They think <b> you'</b>re old. But it's your body<b>  tha</b>t's old. Not your mind. If you younger people truly understood this they would not make remarks about older people to the degree that it has infected our society. Unpleasant people exist <b> of e</b>very age. And idiots can be<b>  81 </b>years old o<b> r 18</b> years old. The only difference between young<b>  peo</b>ple and old pe<b> ople</b> is that old people have had adventures and experiences in life that are fun to share with anybody.",

When families come to visit everyone benefits a little. If you have to consider a place for your loved one  take this one bit of advice. Choose based on smell. If it smells like urine, walk away.

By the time we reach 60,  people fall away quickly living their own lives. It's important to have friends or neighbors to interact with. Thank God for social media, at least we can interact with someone. I must join some kind of club or group because I get very lonely now that family has moved away.

Younger people just don't feel they have anything in <b> common </b>with older people. And let's face it, most people expect to \u2018get' something out of a relationship (I use the term relationship in its broadest sense). I remember in my early 50s was the first time that I saw the world passing me by. I still felt I had value but to strangers I didn't. It's something I have come to understand and thus I'm dealing with it quite well but it is a fact of aging. I'm certain my generation did the same though unintentionally. People have their own lives and I understand that. I have Jesus Christ and a relationship with Him is the best that mankind could ever have.",

I try to be kind and polite to every stranger I meet because one can never be sure if someone else is having a bad day, I don't want to ruin someone's good day or add the negativity of someone else's day. \nHowever I would strongly doubt that I make anyone feel lonely as I don't know anybody at all. The only people I see each day are either strangers in the street or shopkeepers. When I walk the streets I am always the only person walking on my own. I can go months sometimes without open my mouth and I often forget what my voice sounds like. So really I see little chance of me making anyone feel alone at all",

                    "commentText": "@Violence Is Fun : The only reason I responded to your comment was that it essentially tells the lonely that what they are experiencing is irrelevant...not something that should be said to someone who is already struggling with loneliness, which describes most of the people who visit sites like this. If you CHOOSE to have little/no human contact and like it that way, that is one thing. If you are accustomed to having contact and it suddenly either disappears or becomes unresponsive, it can be life changing in a very negative way. Not everyone chooses a solitary life, and this vid is about those who are alone and lonely, but not by choice. In view of what you have shared about yourself, you most likely misunderstood Robin Williams' quote. \n\nI am glad you have your friend, cat. They can be such wonderful company. I have a fantastic little girl: she came to me as a \"stray\", a short bodied tortoise-shell with a crooked tail and one ear half-missing. To me, she is so beautiful. She still has the crooked tail and the torn ear, but she now has a name (KiKi), a safe, warm home and a family. She is a \"rounder\"...always ready to play, or sit on my lap and have a \"conversation\". KiKi insists that her food dish always be full...probably because she was lost and hungry for quite a long time. Does your cat have a \"story\" like my KiKi?\n\nI get that you feel you have no friends (or family).  People today are self-centered, and have no idea of friendship, loyalty, being \"there\" for people they should care about. I've spent my life helping everyone and anyone who needs help. But when their time of need passes, they are gone. I accept that, and I move on. I was grateful for the opportunity to help. Sometimes it is just easier to \"withdraw\" from those around us than to deal with all of their real, or imagined, conflict and chaos. To lose ourselves in YouTube or other social media may be a distraction to fill up the hours; your obvious effort to be kind to strangers or shopkeepers is a small act of kindness that may have helped them through a rough spot...you never know if that one kind act may have changed the course of their day, or even their life. I sense that you are like me: an introvert who finds reaching out to others is difficult. Chance meetings with strangers, or shopkeepers are easier because there are no \"expectations\" attached...no opportunity to be hurt. If that is fine with you, then that's your personality. If it is uncomfortable to be alone, then reaching out, risking rejection may help. \n\nI apologize for assuming that you were merely another troll, trying to elicit an argument. (Hint: Your name might have had something to do with my assumption.) Because that is obviously not what you were doing. I often respond to comments such as yours, because I understand there is a deeper story, and the person is...lonely.\n\nHave a wonderful day. Enjoy that dear little cat. And, take more walks...it's good for the soul. Feel free to reply. I LOVE a good conversation!",

My Adult life, is filled with kids and husband, but, at times, my teens don't really need me, and hubby is a workaholic, so, not too much pulls him away from work.  We have great days, don't get me wrong.  Just, the days/weeks can be tough when you feel lonely.  It's important to drop-in, or call, an <b> elderly </b>person, but, not to treat it like a quick delivery of groceries.  My friend <b> (old</b> neighbour) moved 35 minutes away, but, I visit her and her husband, when they feel like company.  They are 92 and 93 year<b> s ol</b>d.  They still have each other, and nursing care comes to their home, as well as a cleaning lady who will prepare lunch/dinner too.  So, my friend is overwhelmed with 'company' and needs a break sometimes.  haha.  She's lucky, her daughter and grandsons live upstairs on another floor of her building.  I'll bring them clothes we no longer need, like pants/sweaters, as they can no longer go shopping.  If she needs stuff, like milk/paper towel, I'll bring it on my way.  Usually, I have this stuff in my home anyway.  She always tries to pay for it.  It's hard to take money from her... she has trouble getting to the bank to get cash.  Her husband has dementia, so, she is the one to get things done.  She's in a wheel chair now, and has been more or less bedridden.  It's tough getting older.  It's hard to picture ourselves getting older, or becoming dependent.  That being said, it's really important for me to do as much as I can to make their day better, when I can.",

I still love my wife, Lois more than my own life. Loneliness is unbearable most of the time (very sad experience). I lost everything I worked so very hard for and the<b>  woman</b> I love more than any other for the rest of my lifetime. I was a Minister, every time I pressed foreword to preach & study deeply the Holy Scriptures in great depth, my family turned against me. But, GOD IS & ALWAYS WILL BE MY #1; my Wife was #2 in my life. Life was good, but in one surprising hour all of it, everything that was important to me was gone forever, but it was never enough to shake my total complete trust in my God, JESUS CHRIST - still my number 1 forever.... Facing divorce now that I don't want at all. If it weren't for JESUS helping me, I wouldn't have made it. \n'I WALK BY FAITH, NOT BY SIGHT....'\n[Dated: Oct. 27, 2018]\nI'm proud to say: I am still a strong Christian Preacher always serving Jesus always and forever.......",

Have 3 things going, read and listen to music while watching a TV program, and while you're petting your dog next to you.  Do NOT think about being lonely, that only makes it worse.  Live in the moment, not the past.  Memories are great to bring to mind IF they make you happy -- do NOT allow yourself to think of things that make you melancholy.",

My mother left my father when I was 6 years <b> old.</b>   We moved a lot so I went to 7 different schools by the time I was in 7th grade !  Never had any friends during that period of time,  so I got used to being alone and became content with it.   Been married to a lovely lady for 40 years now !  But when she goes off to work on Monday is my favorite time !  Being alone is something I love because I can think more clearly and no one bothers me !  I love quiet time by myself !

            "commentText": "Jun Barathy   While I live in a Hostel i am also living with the dead. I have my husbands Ashes on a shelf. I suggested a man here do the same when his wife died, he declined.  I like my own company, having a computer is a BIG plus, and Face Book, and You Tube ,  I add my BIT to the latter two.  I had a Canary, poor chat just sat, no singing, I gave to a friend who found him a lady friend, and they have had nearly 20 babies. I think he thought \"And I sat up there all that time \"\nEverything is managed for us, a bus outing most weeks.all Flocks are taken care of.\n We have handicraft, music, films, meetings,  Cooking afternoons, Scones, Pikelets Damper  cooked, medication taken care of. We have a furnished room, but can add our own pieces, TV, Air Con. And ensuite  well equipped.  The staff are kind, and helpful, I have only had trouble with two,one is barred from my room. The down side, theft, silly things, only worth 2 or 3 dollars.\nHad i stayed in my house, which I owned there would have been hundreds of dollars per year for insurance, mower man, carers, and being by myself. My big problem, I have become very <b> deaf,</b> have aids, cannot use the phone and need to rely on captions on the TV\nSo, people if Mum or Dad needs care, be very careful , check out the places available, \nand be prepared to pay an entrance  fee now. There is a big demand, so they are asking huge fees. Up to $500.000.00, which you will get back, when you or yours leave, but the nursing/hostel gets the interest on your money. Another thing, please let you parent\ndeclutter their home themselves. \nAfter 58 years of marriage at the I time I came here, I arrived with my clothes, and TV.\nBoth my husband and i were lucky, the entrance fee started after we arrived. He died aged 92.\nSo I hope this will help you choose and perhaps understand hostel/ nursing home living.",

I loved having cats but now that my last cat passed away of kidney failure (lived with me 18 years), I decided to not adopt another since 18 years would add to 89 and I have no idea how I'll be then or if I'll even be. Pets get very attached to a person and vice versa. Don't want to leave behind a pet, not knowing how he would be treated by someone else. My health is great and I make sure that it keeps that way (by staying away from people who make a living out of sick people, I'm a bit paranoid, lol.) Last time a was sick with anything worse than a mild cold was in 1999, when I decided to change what I eat.",

Those that do want to visit have work or other family members to take care of. A lot of my nursing home residents have family who live out of state and rarely visit. Sad, really.

That will take a long time. Until then I am lonely. I just have to endure until my work to end it is done. But living alone and being lonely are two different things.",

I think at some point people need to address it and deal with it.  I love being alone and I'm also getting<b>  old</b>.  I have a sense of tremendous freedom that I wouldn't change for the world.  There is something in our society that makes us think that being alone is some horrible ordeal and even something to be ashamed of.  It isn't!  As long as you have a mind, you can think and move from place to place in the confines of the mind.  There is no such thing as being isolated - not if you appreciate your world and what it has to offer you and that may not be other people.  I think we have to do more to help people accept being alone.  I wouldn't trade my aloneness for anything in the world.  I do, on occasion like to talk to people, but I prefer being with myself.  I do have a cat that I love.",

Even the wildlife & pets fill my day.  If the deva emotions should stick to me a moment, or idle mind bourdom.  It is time to walk see others point of view,  explore & learn,  I'm young 1yr + few months until 80 years.  My best friends were born in 1880+'s, so now they are gone, physically, but their council & wisdoms they shared still keep me eager to see the next adventure.  A mis-step- mess-up, is still just a new adventure/lesson.  True I can NOT keep pace with many, so I do MY_BEST & just keep my own pace. Exercise to make me sweat--not perspire, really sweat,  for an hour~  2-3 time a week is internal cleaning,  showers as often a day as wanted are so refreshing.  You must live by the <b> old </b>world saying:\n\" Live as long as you want too, & Want to as long as you LIVE\".  Attitude & view __,  are the voloume-- knob on life.  Thankfulness, Is comfort. \n           I have lost:_ 1 younger sister, a younger son;  5 younger brothers, 2-sets of parents;  30-45% of classmates; 95% friends,  50% neighbors.  Because my address book gets all X'ed  out--I'm on my third one.  Just lost a treasure of a cuz - he was just about 11months younger & more blood kin to me than any of my siblings, but he was one to boast over, as his life was so well run.  Just gather the blossoms & fruits & make tintures of the weeds.  We must Build our ''''Roses for  OUR DECEMBER'''''   Life is like doing the laundry_ wring it dry;  before you hang it out to dry.",

            "commentText": "I'm <b> Indian </b>and one thing I'm really proud of my culture is that there is no concept of children and parents living separately no matter how<b>  old</b> or young one maybe (exceptions excluded). Family is family, from the day you are born till the day you are dead. I never really understood this pathetic idea of children not living with their parents and taking care of them when they'r<b> e ol</b>d and frail, just like the parents took care of their children when they are young and frail. Seriously I wanna ask the westerners: what's so important about \"living separately\"? I don't find this one thing civilized at all about the \"civilized\" world. Living with one's parents doesn't necessarily mean one has to be dependent on someone. Living together under one roof, have meals together, conversations, laughter, sorrows together is such a joy and kind of a need for humans considering we are social animals. So many things are good about the west, it is developed, has higher standard of living etc etc, but I find this one thing absolutely repulsive and disgusting about the west. I'm a 27 ye<b> ar o</b>ld male living in a different city from my parents' for work. But sooner or later, one day me and my parents (and my future family) are gonna live together or at least in absolute proximity so that everyday we see each other, eat together etc. This is how it is meant to be. We are not jungle animals that we need to be \"out in the wild\" hunting for our food alone once we have grown up. People in the west can live with their wife/ husband/ child /children, but not with their parents, disgusting!",

So in other country like the philippines sticking together is important and saving money for education of a child and in case of any crisis like hospitalization of a member of a family especially parents who are sick because when u are admitted to the hospital if u dont have money you will die...Also most of the land here in the phil especially in the province where their houses built and stand with a wide backyard and others with a wide farm are acquired from the great great grandmom and grand dad passed to children and most of the neighbor are relatives... My sympathy goes to those who are living alone but dont worry God is with you...",

We transcend mere mortal feelings and know what it feels like to be infinite... if only for a moment in time. For an eternity within a second, I am free and know who I am... there is no I. Only the eternal spirit of the Universe, the breath of the Tao  coursing through my veins.\nThat is all I feel anguish over, is to be disconnected from the Universe. When I make that connection, I feel rushes of energy flowing through me... it is waves of pure light, energy and love and I see God in the Eternal All.",

Being a 'friend' means visiting them at least once a week and calling them on the phone at least twice a week.  After that it's up to yourself how much additional effort you want to put into the friendship.  Everyone I know does a lot more than the visit and the two phone calls.  We all become genuine friends with th<b> e ol</b>d person we befriend.  We take them out on day trips, celebrate their birthdays, do a few tasks that need doing in their home.  Inter-generational friendships are the most enriching because we gain a different perspective on life and there is so much to learn from that.  Our organisation's motto is \"Flowers before bread\" meaning that feeding the soul is even more important than feeding the body.  People in the Comments who say \"I'd love to befriend the lone<b> ly wom</b>an in the video\" need to realize that <b> the wo</b>man in the video is already in their lives.  She is<b>  the</b> old lady walking alone around the supermarket.  She i<b> s th</b>e old lady walking slowly in front of you as you hurry along the pavement.  She <b> is t</b>he old lady living six doors up the street from your house whom you have never had time to invite in for coffe<b> e.  </b>The old lady in the video is all around you.  You don't need to <b> find t</b>he woman in the video.  She is already here.",

For others that are active and can go out, then joining clubs, visiting museums, parks, and VOLUNTEERING in the community is key. The city I live in has tons of <b> elderly(</b>60-95) volunteers that do it to help the community, stay active and social. It's the<b>  elderly</b> that can't get out of the house, do to disability, that have a bigger challenge with loneliness. Those are the ones that need to make connections, even if online or over the phone otherwise they don't ever speak to another human. Pets are also a huge source of comfort. Not just dogs and cats but smaller creatures like gunie<b> a pig</b>s. Activities like doing puzzles, reading, painting and even caring for plants are all helpful in staving off loneliness. The right lamps(the kind used for seasonal affective disorder) helps keep the \"blues\" and mild depression away(They help with Serotonin levels in the brain) Especially in regions with less sunny days due to rain, overcast or snow. If you have your health and are pretty active in your 80s and 90s, you've got it made.",

There are plenty of organizations to get involved in. <b> Elderly </b>could have someone come get them from the church to take them to church where they can sit in the nursery. They don't have to do anything just sit there and talk to the children or hold the babies and be a blessing. The issue is getting out not waiting for someone to come to them. If they cannot get out then someone would have to come get them from the organization they are involved in. I enjoy doing crafts with mentally challenged adults and children. Everyone needs to to feel like they have some worth. Just a kind word to someone at the store can really bless someone. Even an<b>  elderly</b> person can say a kind word.",

You could find other adults who are in the same situation and build your own Co-housing Community. Co-Housing Communities mean that each person has their own small home & outdoor space, (in some cases just a balcony) but there is also shared space for the community. \n      So it might be an estate with small houses & little gardens and also a bigger house which provides a large kitchen and dining/social space for regular shared meals, plus some bedrooms for visitors and maybe a laundry or additional storage space. Outside there would be a shared vegetable garden and recreation area.\n     Co-Housing Communities in cities are sometimes blocks of flats. They have a larger flat or centre with shared facilities and often a shared courtyard and /or roof garden. \n         Why dosent anyone talk about how the nature of the housing we build isolates people? These sort of communities would help a great deal. I believe all <b> elderly </b>and<b>  disabled</b> people should have the choice of community living. I think a lot of young people would like to have this choice too.",

            "commentText": "Tragic to have  lived such full  lives and be alone but they can make different living arrangements so they are not alone.  \n\nIs there no community centre close or a seniors centre. I suspect it's  more too, not having loved ones alive and having to rely on volunteers. I have lost friends and each one  takes a part if me but in reality it's just ling lost  memories and you must go on. \n\nMy husband has been in care 20 years. I have seen many lovely people who end up in care  there because none of their friends  or close caring relatives are alive any longer.  Other family are distant or busy.  But you can rise above that. After all you have been through in life your going to allow loneliness to get you down. Cone on now...\n\n It's important to not get too isolated. Perhaps moving into a seniors apartment if they are not ready for assisted living. They seems both, very lovely and most certanly not candidates for care. \n\nThey might find a community of friends  in an apartment. Sometimes we stay too long not wanting to give up our homes but life does need altering as we <b> age.</b> Less is more and less chores or  cleaning and yard work but also safety become priorities. .\n\n A simpler life surrounded by seniors  dealing with the same issues can be comforting. Their Dr or  Church might be helpful in finding a great place to<b>  transition</b>. Not much point staying at home all the time. These dear people are a treasure and should still be enjoying life. \n\nI think there is a time when family must encourage them to alter their  living arrangements but also respecting their activity level and social preferences. Perhaps closer to a town or city's centre so they go for walks to the local shops and parks.  \n\nOf course sometimes family vultures may be waiting for their home. They should sell and enjoy the money. Find a nic<b> e senio</b>r apartment or the new thing is  some seniors are cruising because of  the costs and all meals and activities included it works out economical for them. Bith could go on a cruise together. Separate cabins but as travel company. \n\nYour lovely people get moving enjoying your life.  Being alone is a choice now....you know that.....It's time to get busy and make sime positive changes. \n\nAs a young girl in High School wirking as a supervisor at a Kmart my Manage said to train my young staff to akways taje a moment to have a conversation with<b>  a seni</b>or at the checkouts. He said as your saying , they may be the only person they speak to all day. \n\nThat lesson stayed with me all my life. Kindness Rules. But also these days there is no need to not be involved as active healthy seniors. Now, get  going. Even a school program might like having you help at events or help children learn to read even once a month or be a Grandparent to a family that has none. They have adopt a Grandparent program in Canada. They must where you are or start one. \n\nThat would be such a gift for them. There is much we can all learn from you. Please seek out a healthy program to be involved with. Your precious lively people with so much to give...dont be alone. Do whatevrer is necessary to  find involvement. \u2764",

I live alone and I felt I no longer have purpose in life.  So what I did, I adopted a family in need with 4 beautiful children.  I trained the parents to manage my 2 remaining restaurants and pay them handsomely.   The remaining income, I spend  with the children.   We swim in rivers, we do gardening, I bought them animals for them to take care of, I fill up their fridge with lots of ice cream, chocolates, bread and whatever they ask me to buy.  From time to time we go shopping and drive them wherever they want to go.  I improve their house and partitioned it for every kid to have his/her comfortable and private room.  I know they will grow up like my children but I have a strong feeling, they will always be around for me.",

Even if your married or in a relationship you gotta deal with their \"BULLSHIT\"! lol If you get horny you can \"hook up\" and send them on their way. Living alone has a certain \"dignity\". If you want to be in a \"relationship\" you can do it and have \"separate\" places. I've got my dog \"Mac\" and he's a good companion. Some people NEVER get married and are FINE with that. I'm one of THOSE people! lol Besides why would I fork over ALL the things I've worked hard for all my life to someone who does not deserve them?? There are NUMEROUS charities I would rather give that money to. Especially animal causes.",

And then they wonder later why their own kids neglected them when they become<b>  old</b>. \nWe have to teach others how we want to be treated by treating others with true love which is in action. \nAnd action sometimes is an inconvenience for people. \n\nSingle people get lonely too but years of practice, they learn how to find tools and practices to get outside of themselves and get out of self pity by reaching out and being there for others.",

So ironic, that most days I dream of finding some \"alone\" time to do those things I want to do that never seem possible because I am always caring for others & their priorities. I was wondering if these lonely people have any hobbies, such as drawing or painting or reading or writing. Neither of them seem to be reaching out to others on a regular basis -- they say to have friends, one must be friendly. I know some parents of a friend thaf are very social in their advancing years & they often do things to get out & keep busy: visiting friends & family, traveling, walking, out to eat & have tea/coffee, going to church, fixing up the house, just having fun, etc. Life is what you make of it & one cannot sit around feeling sorry about it. Go rescue a dog or cat at the animal shelter & take the focus off of oneself would help to cure loneliness  -- also accepting Jesus into your heart will fill any void. God is Love. Perfect love from God  takes away all fear.",

I'm nearly 50 and my parents are in their mid-80s, and I'm so thankful to still have both of them, so I make it a point to be with them at least once or twice a week, even though they live in a different city, it's only an hour drive, and I cherish every second I have with them, it's just such a shame that more people don't do what I do. I know we're all busy with our lives, but they won't be around forever, and I refuse to be at their graveside crying, saying I wish I would've spent more time with them, I can at least have the satisfaction of knowing I did everything I could to make their final years happy, I only pray to God that somebody helps me if I'm lucky enough to live that long.",

I too like that there are some who I can email / call.   Access to the world of the internet where we find  youTube being a fascinating \"gift\".  Those who have only television, radio are able to find distraction from the void.  I've been alone for years and the pleasure found at doing things I wasn't always able to  is downright enriching. Having your own -bungalow is an obvious pleasure - for those in this video --  but the community filled with apartments all occupied by a variety of people, the individual apartments extremely well maintained... is a beautiful thing. You can still be as independent as ever while seeing others who are like-minded.  People who are warmed by your smile when you bump elbows in the elevator. Or while at your mailbox.  Or passing here/ there. I've met elders who hang on to their private homes.  In a simple mention of what is available at the residences, like the one I live in, brings the sounds of shock.  No one wants to move out of a home filled with memories. Let me stop rambling now.  ;)",

But I definitely do not want to live in a nursing home. I'd rather live with my family,  but that doesnt always work out either.  I love my children very much, but they have their own lives, and I wouldnt want to burden them. For thats how I would feel. I feel thats even sad ,to feel that way. But generations change. They use to.take care of parents, because they truly wanted to.out of love and concern,  Now its more that they feel, they have to do it, but aren't thrilled about it. I'm not saying, my children feel that way, but, most children do feel that way.  Or do us older people, think they do?  I never did. I took care of my mother for over 20 years, in our home. And enjoyed the time God gave me with her. I miss her terribly.. She passed away in 2012 at 93 yrs <b> old.</b> and I wouldn't have changed, a thing, or  my thoughts on caring for her. I wish I could do it all over again.  Probably if able, I'd like to live, in a small apt. Or assisted living, where I could be on my own, yet have,  someone to look in on me, once in awile. But absolutely NO nursing home for me! I hope God grants my wish, when the time comes. And its coming pretty quickly. Time goes by so fast, it seems I was only 16 yesterday.",

I was one that spent a lot of time with my grandparents, even when one wound up in a nursing home after the death of the other.  Our <b> elderly </b>are special and deserve to not be forgotten.  I can tell you right now that in my observation of the all the dear<b>  elderly</b> people around in the big luxurious nursing home my grandfather was in is that a lot of them were alone all day with just their carers popping in (not many of them about either) and the company of othe<b> r elderl</b>y people who were up for a chat.  Family though.... the majority of the people did not have family that regularly visited them... no way.  The ones that did well their families stood out as I thought what amazing people to care for their loved ones.  Even with my own family, not everyone visited and you want to know what their reason was?  Well he's in a retirement home being cared for, what more do you want?  Well well.... let's see.... COMPANY that's what they'd like.... your hard to find looking at the bottom of a barrel company that's what!  People seem to have it in their dense heads th<b> at elder</b>ly people are no longer social and should just disappear already so the inheritance gets dished out.  The attitude of most today sucks.... I know there are still quite a few caring people though so that gives me hope that we're not all going to wind up in the dismal state that a lot of <b> our elde</b>rly currently are in.  I reckon shame on our society... embarrassing really.",

If I hadn't talked to my grandmother on a daily basis, I would never have found anything about my genealogy.  Those stories were priceless.  Unfortunately, I'm 65 and my kids are all grown with kids of their own.  None of them, including grandchildren, are interested in what I have to say about our family, and the past.  I've done a lot of research just in case, someday, they might be interested in what country, what wars, or who we're related to might interest them.  Families aren't the same as they used to be, and the Asian cultures of taking care of their elders, and thinking of them as being the wise ones, I personally applause as the best cultures.  At 65 and unmarried, I just hope I don't wind up as lonely as these two.  I'm afraid of that.",

After I ran out of money , my child stole everything  they could carry or hock.  But my child wishes me dead and I don't know why unless it is for personal gain.

Most resist being placed  in Long Term Care facilities, and that usually happens after an illness or injury for which they are hospitalized.  Then they are often discharged into a rehab center to regain strength and mobility, if the rehabilitation is either unsuccessful or the patient is left with deficits making them unsafe to be left alone,  then Long Term Care might be an option.  But they can sometimes still be maintained at home quite well with increased caregiving services as required\n\n...an<b>  elderly</b> person living at home can spend time at the loca<b> l Senio</b>r Center if they want to enjoy the company of their contemporaries.

I had some medical issues which made it difficult to work... although I always did.  \nWhen I did get married and have a baby I told them I was coming to visit... to show them their first  grandchild... they knew I was  coming  but when I got there... with my young infant... after a long drive... the door was locked.  They had gone to the beach.   Baby and I sat in a hot car for hours until they finally returned.  No apologies.. didn't care. \n\nWhen they got <b> old </b>and senile guess who cared for them, shopped for them, got them to medical appointments?   \nThey didn't deserve me... but I just did the right thing. Perhaps I pitied them.\nPeople can not always understand a family's dynamics... from  the outside looking in. It is easy to jump to wrong conclusions.  \n\nI was later diagnosed with ptsd.  Some families are like living in a battle zone.  You just keep your head down and try to survive.

I have very little in <b> common </b>with the people outside my door, mostly people don't like to think = it disturbs them.  There is very little \"upscale\" (outside the box) thinking, most people just want to repeat the popular narrative (social engineering), and as time becomes ever more precious, sharing that valuable time with those who do not deserve it becomes a negative. Take for example the very<b>  common</b> practice of chemical spraying by airplanes - geoengineering. I would suggest that fewer than 10% of the population wants to hear ANYTHING about it, especially the social engineering crowd, but it is extremely important to bring it to the public's attention. And i wonder how long it would be before one of these helpful souls suggests \"flu shots\".......think about it. I knew in 1980 that flu shots were TOTALLY useless, never, ever proven to work, even once..... yet nearly everyone reading this would say that it's for my benefit. Well, thank you very much, but i can not reason with these idiots, and do not wish to know them. I prefer my system remain mercury-free as much as possible. I have an unfounded fear that mercury in my brain might attract the aluminum from the sprayplanes and that could result in alzheimer's for me. -<b> - Craz</b>y isn't it? Does anyone remember in the 70-80's they warned us of minute traces of aluminum in anti-perspirant??? Ask a parent or older person...... ignore the tv and THINK.",

There are many, many church organizations both these people could attend, many clubs and activities for older people, most normal people have friends unless they are extremely unpleasant to be around and if these two people have <b> mental </b>health problems etc then there already are plenty of other organizations already being paid for by the over burdened tax paying working people.  I object to the attempt to get even more money from hard-working taxpayers to oblige whiners.  The thing that stands out about both these \"victims\" is how well dressed, housed and cared for they are.  Leave our money alone, stop using working people's tax money for people who have always known this would happen. It' always about screwing even more money out of people who work hard and redistributing it to those who should take responsibility for themselves.  This<b>  old</b> couple have loads of good hearted people running all over the place catering to them.  They have no gratitude.",

I delivered 'Meals on wheels'  at various times and learned that hunger is a huge issue...but not just for food, but for companionship.     I learned a lot from those clients who were willing to share even minute parts of their lives.    Most were 'grab the grub and shut the door' types.   But some were talkative.  Most had lost spouses and had grown grandchildren scattered around the city, state and country.      They were alone, but didn't know how to cope with it.     They didn't know how to process the <b> mental </b>difference between being alone and being lonely.    Many didn't want to learn at<b>  age</b> 85.\n\nI've also worked with nursing home and assisted living environments.   There wa<b> s nothin</b>g sadder than seeing a patient dressed up and ready to spend Christmas with family, but no one ever showed up.  I finally spoke about it to an administrator once   She said she understood my sentiments but then shared something with me that sadly (based on the patients I'd come to know), made sense.    \n\nShe'd been in the business <b> of elder</b>ly care for 30 years.  In the beginning, she too, was  deeply phased by patients\nwith families that just didn't seem to care.    No visitors, no cards or children's drawings taped on the walls of their rooms.    Holidays were spent alone.    They 'celebrated' Christmases,  Thanksgivings and Easter's  with a TV that had limited channels, a holiday skeleton crew who didn't want to be there and a bland meal  or two.  With the passing of each year she was in the biz,  she learned in many cases, a neglec<b> ted sen</b>ior, had been a neglectful parent.     She explained that paying for their parents' care was all the emotion some adult children could muster.       \n\nKarma.   Sad stories, either way.",

A lonely<b>  old</b> person, crumbly and poor, or do you see that thi<b> s woma</b>n/man was once a child, someone loved so much, did you see the person growing up and having hard times and things to learn? Do you see th<b> is elder</b>ly person raising children at their knees, and up at night and holding them to help them as they live  with love and protection, or do you just see <b> and </b>old person not doing anything just abiding time? Do you see<b>  the w</b>oman/ man with grandchildren who love them still and do you see them babysitting and taking god care while you have your own cares? Now what do you see when you look at me? Just someone that reminds y<b> ou o</b>f age and death and you are scared, so now you never come around? Do you s<b> ee t</b>he old person alone and in need? Do you see the person \"waiting\" and \"waiting\" just to hear \" I love you?\"  \n\nIt goes on but it does go together much better than this, but it is on this idea to get one to think of how many can end up if no one cares. It i happening ALOT now more than EVER!\n\nOften a daughter in law or son in law may not want their spouse to bother with the parents as they just do not want to take time out of their life, and only for their own parents but not  \"in laws\" Sometimes they just do not care for them. BUT they were parents and they loved and love now. They have a heart and mind and much to share.. Do we SEE the TRUE person inside and that person living life in AL STAGES that the young person is doing now? BUT then they were LEFT ALONE to handle defeat when aged and weak and tired and hurting and maybe very sick and growing more feeble, and maybe even have problems with their minds? Does ANYONE CARE? \n\nThank God for neighbors, if this does  hap<b> pen and </b>elderly are left alone,  and people  come to check on them. BUT they NEED FAMILY to protect them if they need to go to a nursing home or hospital to be sure they are getting the right care. To make sure they still  know they are loved. It is not enough to say \" You know we love you, we are just too busy\" Then we lay it all on the State or county to take car of them, and no one will care HOW it is done. No one knows how they cry for family when no one comes. \n\nOften people just FORGET that they too are growing older each day. That how will they feel in that  same position they are putting this older person into, if it happens to them later in life? \n\nI worked as nurse for many years and have seen this happen first hand. It certainly does happen and is happening m<b> ore. The</b> elderly used to be so respected and family would come once a week to visit, and maybe have dinner. As long as it was possible for them to handle it, people would try, for those who could anyway, at least they would make sure some made it, even if each person brings a dish to pass, which helps the older person  so much if all jump up and do their part as it is family. . Then all sit and pray and eat together.\n\n That time would LINGER IN THEIR MINDS WHEN LONELY OR JUST ALONE. THEY DO NOT FORGET THOSE MOMENTS THAT YOU SPEND WITH THEM AT THE END TIMES OF THE YEARS. NO ONE KNOWS THE NUMBER OF DAYS ANYONE WILL HAVE. WE SAY PEOPLE LIVE LONGER AND SOMETIMES THEY DO AND YET I HAVE STILL SEEN PEOPLE DIE AT YOUNGER AGES, OF DISEASE AND YES, WE MAY HAVE OUR PARENTS ONE DAY AND NOT THE NEXT. WE MUST ALWAYS THINK TWICE ABOUT THIS. SEE T<b> HAT YO</b>UNG WOMAN OR MAN AND HOW THEY WERE AS PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS AND NO ONE IS PERFECT, AND WE MAKE MISTAKES, BUT THEY DESERVE LOVE AND SOME COMPANY NOW  AND THEN. \n\nI PRAY PEOPLE DO SEE SOMETHING IN THIS VIDEO AND PASS IT ON TO OTHERS. MANY HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT I<b> T MEANS </b>TO ELDERLY PEOPLE TO HAVE LOVE, THEY ARE NOT AS FREE TO RUN AROUND AS THE YOUNG MAY TIEMS.",

There are lots of people there to hang out and do things with, but you can also be alone if you like. These places are more affordable than one might imagine. Im thinking of moving into one at 55. They clean for you and make all your food. They drive you where you want to. I love it! My mom is so happy in hers. She was living on her own when dad died and was just like these folks, but I moved her there and she became more active and made friends. I come and take her to dinner etc...but she has a life again. I plan on moving in over there when Im<b>  old</b> enough for them to take me. I love talking with th<b> e ol</b>d folks. They are fascinating!",

My gmom for example is 71 and all forms of technology seem extremely foreign to her. She doesnt understand the concept of facebook or google for that matter. Some ppl from that generation were just so stuck in their ways they had no interest in getting aquainted, preferring instead to do things the \"<b> old </b>school way\". On the other hand, there are 75 year<b>  old</b> men and women that constantly buy the newest gadgets! They absolutely love all the things the latest technology has to offer. In my opinion this disparity wont exist as time goes on. Eventually everyone in developed countries will be familiar with how the internet works but there still might be a limiting factor regarding finances.",

Years before she died she suffered a stroke and was mostly bedridden. Imagine being alone,  approaching your 90s, and unable to walk. Her widowed daughter in law, who she's really not in good terms with, was the one who visited her once in a while and paid for a stay out maid. I always thought she was a pleasant <b> woman </b>but I've heard she can be difficult so the maids actually kept resigning. That's probably the reason why her family practically abandoned her. Still it's sad. She passed away almost two years ago.",

I'm retired now, alone, and have loved every minute of my solitude when I could have it.  I'm happier, healthier and calmer than I have ever been and look forward to more of my quiet life.  My only worry is my health and safety with no one around should I fall or have a health emergency.  I'm ever so grateful for my <b> mental </b>health that does not care about loneliness and instead embraces it.  For others I'm sad that they suffer loneliness at all, at any time in life; it seems a terrible emotion to be burdened with.  I'm so very lucky to not have that burden.",

But although I occasionally long for company, I never feel truly alone, because the Lord Jesus is my best Friend and constant companion.  He also reminds me of things out of the blue that I had completely forgotten:  the other day it was:  \"Check the oil in your car.\"  I dismissed it at first because I felt sure there was enough.  But it kept coming to me, so I did, sure enough it was very low!  I topped it up before I set out.  Sometimes its; \"Pay your power bill.\"  I would think, \"Oh? I thought I had!\"  So I'd check and sure enough I hadn't.  Its the little things that Jesus does for me that lets me know He cares - and there are a great many of them - and some big things too!  Like he healed me of cancer in 1992 and surgery was cancelled.  Id prayed for myself and went back tot he specialist and the result was I did not need surgery.  He is a wonderful friend.",

Cheer up folks we are loved that he proves it to us when we call out to him or not. Listen to your windchime sometimes, he may play a tune for you. Or every leaf you see maybe shaped like a heart.  GOD'S love for us is Great that's why he sent Jesus. He will make us content. I am.  But yes it would be nice if someone would take me out to dinner, or anywhere out of the house!",

There is clearly no guarantee people will be with you forever and no one should ever lean on that for assurance. And even then when you're around people, you can still feel lonely. It doesn't even exactly matter with having people around. Alone is just something we all will experience in life or is already experiencing. After all, we came in this world alone and will likely leave it alone. The only thing I can suggest is to try to not look at it in a negative way. Also the fact that it is a part of life and we will all experience it just like death. In cases, if your religious like me, God will help to be able to better cope with the aloneness with just having him in your life.",

Our house was sold (in fact it was auctioned because of events beyond my control)  The day I left was one of the saddest of my entire life as I told each tree, each bush, and each plant I had known since child-hood good-bye. You can call me <b> crazy,</b> but I heard all of them asking me \"Why?\" and it destroyed me to leave them.

We remember exactly what life we were leading when we planted them a couple of inches high, maybe even from seed, and we watch them every day. When somebody chops them down they take a part of us down too. Have you found a better life today and have you been able to move forward?",

I probably would qualify because I have only about 2 hours total per day to sit and one hour a day to stand unassisted.  Plus the 3 hours time must be broken up, so no 1/2 hour bus trips.

At this point I do seem to  need alone time, and do get very busy too , with associations and volunteer work, and need to retreat from that too at times..  with what I am doing, am kept busy. But it is great to know you are loved, and that people do care if you are alive or not. Friends and family may come, yet guess we do like our children to show the love we have given at times when we get older. But overall we can handle alot of \"alone \" time at one point of our life if needed, but what happens when totally frail and alone and not much time left, could really be frightening unless grown children are around to some kind of extent. ( If you have children)  My lovely furry angora cat is my \"Baby\" She needs me and loves me and wants me ,even if I am feeling tired, upset or anything else, she understands it all. I do just the same for her. \n\nSome people just find 'friends' and that is it for them! Wonderful if that can take the place of their own children, but most do want their grown children near them sometimes.",

I travel alone, go to dinner alone ,plays , movies and concerts alone and enjoy every second .To the contrary sometimes when I have someone else with me I find it stifling resulting in compromising..",

He's so smart. He motivates me to walk every day, animals lower blood pressure just by patting them & they never judge you. They are content to just be with you, animals are the best!

I post videos of my horses once in a while. I have made a few really great friends because of it. Two of the people are around your <b> age.</b> Anyone here is invited to take a look so you all can see I'm a nice person for Carrol and we can all befriend Carol on my page. How does that sound? I made the channel to try to make people happy. I often see people who are troubled by the world <b> (nothing</b> to be ashamed of) to \"come look at my horses...it will cheer you up!\"  You are welcome there with us. Read the few comments that are there and you will see that I have great relationships with the ladies who have blessed me with their friendship. Please come on over! Just click on the gray circle by my name and it will direct you to my channel. I don't ask people for money and I don't care about how many Subscribers I have. I kind of like being a little secret, that way, we can really have good conversations and the whole world doesn't know about it. Come on over and see what I mean. All of you are welcome to check my video and DECERN if you like it or not. If you don't like it, you can advise Carol to not subscribe. I want everyone to know I am a nice person and Carol would have a nice place to come for friendship. Jesus said...\"As I have loved you, love one another\" and he also said \"Love thy Neighbor\"  and \"Do unto others as I have done unto you\" and \"to judge them off their fruits\" so, come on over...anyone who sees this who likes my idea is welcome to come see! Thanks for reading! Hope to see you! \ud83d\udc34\ud83d\udc0e\ud83d\udc13\ud83d\udc1e\ud83d\udc1d\ud83c\udf37\ud83c\udf3c\ud83c\udf3b\ud83c\udf38\ud83d\udc90\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\udc0e\ud83d\udc34",

My daughter in law, always has to have a friend on her arm, to make her feel complete. I think her need for a father figure, has alot to do with it. Her parents were divorced  when she was young, and she didn't have, a dad , so she now needs that. Maybe these friends, fulfill that need. And she can't sit still, for 1 second.

She lucked in with you \"looking after her.\"\n I am not needing anyone to \"fend\" for me, 73 is not \"<b> old\"</b> unless she is either sickly or has not cared for her health and well being.  I did not throw my husband away - he died many years ago and I then faced life with courage and enjoy the so called challenges.  \nThere is a whole system out here that caters to older people and if one is normal and healthy it's great.  We do not need any more tax payer's money taken for unnecessary public servants to get cushy jobs pretending to \"Look after lonely people\".  It has to stop.\n Perhaps your Mother is too dependent, you say she \"has no-one else\", that's odd because she has known many hundreds of people during her life and they are all out there still.  Getting<b>  old</b> is NOT the problem that some people are led to believe.  Getting 'free' money or manipulating others is the fashion and that is wrong.",

I don't care about romance is anymore but I pray before every where I go but I could just make one good girlfriend. It never happens. And I have been praying for a friend so long for something so simple. Where did everybody go?  Used to have family dinners at holidays with 15 to 20 people, now I spend Christmas alone in a foreign country at that. I cannot afford to live in my own country the US. It makes it all the lonelier.  The worst was having to take a taxi all the way to a huge city in a foreign country for major surgery. I wake up and<b>  nobody</b> is there. Then I take a taxi again 45 minutes all the way home and no one is there to greet me. I am in pain if there is no one there. I need a little help with groceries, but no one is there. All I want to is to see a  friend to meet for coffee several times a week and that would be a whole lot. I had six surgeries in this country an<b> d nobod</b>y bothered to come down and help me.  I have become the extraneous nonessential distant relative who might get an annual call. I wake up in the morning's and I wonder\"what for\". I volunteered two days a week, then we say goodbye and I go home alone.",

I struggle myself and I am married with a mostly nasty 18 yr. <b> old </b>son.  I  am somewhat involved in church and have a part time job but it is surprising to me how lonely I can still get.  I really wish there was a way that lonely people in neighborhoods could get-together on a somewhat regular basis to perhaps play cards, have tea and dessert or something on a regular basis that they could count on to help relieve these isolated feelings. Maybe I will need to be the gathering place for these activities - maybe . . .",

            "commentText": "So Sad So Horrible, I'm now 56 I never married no siblings or other family friends have gone their own ways and can't really seem to be bothered or you look to them pathetic or depressing no one wants to hear your problems when they have happiness but don't realize it can also happen to them in an instant!! They invite you to engagements but really hope you don't take them up or show!! I been alone since almost birth my mother died when I was 8 months <b> old </b>my father was around till I was 8 then seemed to loose affection he found a women with a daughter and pretty much pushed me to the side I managed on my own because I was young strong outgoing and yes had good looks, I'd only see my father when he wanted to take out his anger or frustrations I made a great punching bag and verbal abuse toy till I became a teen and put my hands up and said NO MORE!! He later showed up as I was in my mid 20's doing well and made me feel as I owed him the world and I complied as a good son but he started his verbal comments and caused a problem with my relationships!! Although we lived and worked in the same trade together we never were close I believe only memories of good times before I was 9 and convenience and both the fear of loneliness kept us together but at a distance this would seem strange to people with a family and who have love in their lives they can't understand this concept but it works for those who fear being alone or have been abused!! At 41 I became injured at work causing me to end my trade also at the same time my father now retired had just developed Lung Cancer the man who once pushed me to the side as a child who also was an only child and no one to care for him looked to me and I as a good son who would never do what he did to me abandon stood up and for 2 years cared for him alone he would not let anyone else but me care for him as I kept for 2 years under such difficultness and abusive words from him never stopped I cared for him to the end I was 165 lbs. at the start and went down to 125 lbs. at the day of his death I had him as he wished to die at home holding his hand till his final breath all alone in the middle of the night waiting till morning to call the Mortician the only thing alive with me is a little puppy who I truly love then as today and the only love true love unconditional love I ever had!! Please anyone out there never harm an animal they can be the only love we ever have a mans truly best friend!! Immediately after I had a sever nervous breakdown at just 43 still a good looking man for 5 years I suffered and self-cared myself back with the help of only a little dog now in my late 40's from medication I have gained weight but still have looks but older also back always in pain and now 56 I haven't celebrated a birthday in over 10 years its just another day I mark of some times even forgetting the day if I am busy completely!! I am still with my dog he is now<b>  ageing</b> himself I fear the moment he leaves me he has been my only source of life and love ever!! I know I will never see 70 or even 65 which gives me only a 9 year window and I don't know if my little friend leaves how much longer I or anyone in my position as the years have now taken a toll on me my mind my feelings and life itself I am very independent and set in my ways I have no one!!! Days can be long lonely but for my pup!! After I may be forced to do the only thing that's right and leave myself because going on may be more difficult than staying!! Oh I had some Joy in life I even loved once as they say better to of know love once then never!! But time has caught up with me and I believe I won't be able to move on further!! Those who don't know this life can not understand I honestly can say if things were different I could have been a Great and Loving Father and or Husband or both but for some this never happens!! So I hope where ever I end up in\u00a0 another life or in Gods world I can find the Love one wishes and not worry about Loneliness!! I can't say I lived life as a Saint far from it my life was wild if not wicked but I never harmed or murdered anyone or anything!! I just see it as <b> I ag</b>e not much is left!! So yes this video is so sad!!",

I hope your situation changes for the better. I do understand that it is hard for you to be able to find a way to express your needs to your daughter and grandson. Heres an idea; Why don't YOU be the one who starts calling your daughter and/or your grandson Daily?  Hopefully, they will start responding by beginning to be the ones who are calling you as well!!\ud83d\ude09....Wishing you all the Very Best!!!",

It really does make a person feel less lonely themselves when they reach out to others in need.  And to bring a friend as well.  So happy that you shared love with her an she was so overjoyed.

Keep your mind busy with good memories  and try to push bad ones aside, can not go back a change anything so don't dwell on them. Computers are great ,you can travel around the World and not leave home. Web cams day or night for live feed to watch cities and animals. Watch movies,shows,series etc. Games free on puter. Find something that makes you sad move to something else. I have a bird that talks and just got an 8 yr. <b> old </b>dog that needed a home and I needed something that makes me get up weather I want to or not. Arts and crafts if that is what you like to do,you now have time. Potted plants,animals outside. I do hate the bugs! Get something done round the house ,wash cloths, dishes,pay bills OL. Take an afternoon nap. No one to say you can not do what you feel like doing. I use to take care of older people and they had great stories to tell. I enjoyed listening to them. I'm getting a car and hope to get out a little. I don't walk well my hip is out but I use a walker and I will go to flea markets, good will, and yard sales.Take my time in the food stores. Soon I hope. So far I have stayed busy here at home , some days I cook ,some days I have pre-made food to eat . I freeze extra food when I cook.. Days seem to pass by quickly. I try to stay content.  Sure there is a down side but then I remember then I was over loaded with work and some days they wanted to argue about<b>  nothing</b>. Everything is peaceful now. Kids are grown, they have children and swing by once a month. I remember when mine were little,I didn't have time either. I guess I'm odd ! Hope this help someone. It wasn't in my plan to be alone ,but it is what it is. Happy 4 th. everyone! BTW Yes I have cranky days too.ROFL",

Technically she really isn't my blood relative, her husband was my father's life long friend. Every holiday I have invited them to spend with my family has been declined, they didn't want to be around all of the noise etc. I live an hour away from her but I travel at least once a week to go & visit with her & take care of her laundry & bring her treats. In the last few years she has exhibited signs of dementia & was recently placed in an assisted care facility. I cannot take care of her on a full time basis. She refuses to take her meds, practice basic hygiene and cannot/ will not take care of her home or cook for herself and she refused to let anyone help as well. The home that she is in takes very good care of her, the staff love her (even when she is being bitchy and unbearable!) and for the most part she is happy. Auntie & uncle lived their lives on their own terms just like this <b> woman </b>has. To maintain and make relationships work takes effort, not everyone can or wants to do that.",

My sister however(who had the power of attorney) would not let me, and placed our Mother in a Nursing home.

So many are so selfish.  Our culture needs to address this and change how the sick and<b>  elderly</b> are treated. And a good start would be to start paying the CNA's a decent wage. They are caring for ou<b> r elderl</b>y and changing their diapers etc... And their job is very difficult and should be paid well. It is very important what they do! The problem is that our cultures attitude towards the sick a<b> nd elder</b>ly is not right and it is a systemic issue in the  family, culture and government. Most children see their parents not caring for the grandparents as they should be. And then it happens to them and their children aren't around. Which should not be a shock to them. But many times, even when the parents did good, most children still aren't there for them. \n\nThere is a lot of abuse that goes on and that should be penalized and punished very harshly! Just as abuse towards animals should be punished much more severely! We should be in the streets trying to make changes in our society. But so many do not care about what happens to others, UNTIL it happens to them. And this is a root cause of so much evil. There is a severe lack of empathy and compassion.  I wish Jesus would come back and finally end all the suffering!!! Because it looks like society is going to continue to get even more selfish and only care more for themselves and not care about others. Just as Jesus said it would be.",

My older and only sibling is the opposite: 4 grown children and now living in a big home with his grandkids in an upper suite. 3 years ago I was unceremoniously reminded with a smirk the first time I met his grandchild that, 'I was never going to have grandkids like him.' That was the last time I ever saw him or his family. When I see the happy families in my town with their kids/grandkids I just pray that my final exit is merciful and if so, soon. I only eat a meal with someone else perhaps once a month and days can go by without speaking to someone. What's worse is that I've received more threats of violence from young people in the past year and that's getting scary.",

No one calls me. My last personal conversation with someone was...I don't remember honestly. March, April, maybe. People don't care how much we know until they know how much we care! We live in a world where people just don't care anymore. I care, I just have no one to care for. I don't want to live as long as these sweet people in this video, for I've been alone since I was 40, in 2000. 18  years has been more than enough for me. I have Jesus, HE should be enough,  right? I'm weak, I am flesh. I'm sorry I complained. Please forgive me. I deserve this lonely life I live, I suppose.",

Science has proven the effects in tests but we all know its true from <b> common </b>sense.  \nhair salon, a short 10 minute neck and shoulder massage will work wonderful.   Anyway, having a house pet around helps but it lacks communication skills.  My gosh why people today are so cruel for not sharing some daily conversations.  One reason i divorced my wife was the stupid office work load she had, and she would come home tired and not wanting to chat with me.. long naps at night,... i gave up and left.  What is so hard about chatting about some daily news or movie actors...  Ultra  Feminist created a disaster for men in the last 50 years (what is odd is that women have changed but most men have not).  So all this dating and looking for a match is futile in the end.  Until women and men figure out new social inter action, socio politics... this society is not normal and functioning for men and women.  Millions will be alone and unhappy in their 70's... Economics can save a few, but there's no guarantees in Capitalism economies, it goes boom and bust, that's the norm.",

Maybe that's your problem? Anyway, I've made friends despite\nthis problem in the past, but for reasons I won't go into,  I have some personal\nproblems to take care of in the next 2 or 3 months, and then I'll make an effort.\nThe last time I did it was about 1968 in the last semester in the 8th grade, and\nit was the hardest thing I ever did in my life to approach someone and ask them\nto come over. But the only way to get our minds off of ourselves is to do this\nand other activities or we drive ourselves nuts every day with too much time\non our hands and obsessing over things.",

I have had relationships and a few friends in my time but I much rather come home to an empty house free from the nagging taunts and storm-in-a-teacup noise that comes from most women. Maybe it is selfish but I just prefer the peace and quiet and enjoy my time doing the things I choose to do, go to the places I want to go and see the family and friends I choose to see, when I want to see them. I suppose I may be wired differently to most and the past I have experienced brings me to the logical conclusion of who I am. It may be of some comfort also that it's okay to be alone and not succumb to the trends of society to feel compelled to spend your time in the presence of others if it's not what you desire.",

As for the tolerance,  you can argue,  have different opinions but you just just get on with it. \nI have family friend who at 36 with her husband and 3kids,her husband's parent live there, are in their  60s, but still working, then her husband grandmother who's in her late 80, their family is so beautiful and happy.  My friend really never paid for childcare for all her children! \nPersonally,  I know this might not work for all families but it can go along way in a lot cases.

Try to fill your days taking care of yourself, eat healthy and stay as active as you can while you still can. This will raise your vibration and bring great things into your life. Children unfortunately are selfish and too busy caught up in the drama of life to understand sometimes. I know, as I am 23 years <b> old </b>and I try my best not to be this way with my grandmother. One day when they are<b>  old</b> and you are gone, they will look back on this with a profound sadness so deep it will be nearly unbearable. Because it will only be once father time catches up with them that they will understand what it is like to fear growin<b> g ol</b>d alone. I am so sorry you have to go through this, but remember that you are loved, looked over and never alone. There are an entire host of amazingly kind people waiting to meet and befriend you. Don't give up.",

The natural world is quite a marvel to enjoy; however, man with wonderful inventions and discoveries has also screwed up almost every way that man can be happy and whole. \nAnd that is by its purposeful ways of enslaving mankind through money and authoritarian power. This alone and not to alone has made it quite a hellish existence for many people.  Mostly the poor, The ill, and the <b> old.</b>\nOnce one enters into those 3 different realities, the quality of life will diminish and you will suffer a great deal. \nPlease don't tell this person how to live or how to feel her feelings. You dismiss and devalue her experience and her life and for that you're not respecting her own reality and she deserves to have it and express it. \nIt's through empathy and understanding people who suffer that allows us to pass through our own selfishness and help them. By First listening and not trying to change them but be the example by loving them and then miraculously through our love help and acceptance, they actually do change and see the world differently because of the love they receive and feel back towards the helper other than the rejection and neglect and abuse that they receive from the powers that be and the large trail that a selfish society leaves for them.",

We're so pampered nowadays that we get bored & spoiled and lose track of how relatively good we have it.  Humans create many problems for themselves, no doubt, and we should try to improve the quality of life, but blissful perfection is unrealistic, and not the natural state of biological life on Earth.",

I've known Love, and now I know I have none... the soft, warm skin of an adorable Girl...how the new days first rays of sun, dance thru Her long, dark, lovely hair, another 24 hours to Love Her, do something Loving and kind for her... that's all over, knowing you'll never hold a Beautiful Girl in your arms, ever again, going out, seeing young couples, pushing a stroller, or two, laughing, LOVING each other..  knowing that no matter what kind of shit the world throws at either of them, they know that at home, there's love, and kindness, and babies, and goodness, and caring... and then I go home to my microwave dinner, that tastes like shit no matter what, because the main ingredient is LONLINESS... I got 13 channels of shit on the TV to choose from...I got Wild, staring eyes, and I got a strong urge to FLY... but I got nowhere to fly to... when I try to get thru, on the telephone to you, girl, there'll be <b> nobody </b>home... then to bed... Alone... hating god for allowing human life to be this empty, this cold... my bedroom, so empty... a bedroom, without a<b>  Woman</b>, is like a heart, without a beat... we shared the evenings, we shared each day, in Love together, we found our way... but soon the world, had it's evil way, our Love was blinded, Love went astray.... god, just take me now, you heartless PRICK.... you oughta know when a LOSER you created, wants no more of the LONLINESS you put him in, the loser you watch becoming more and more miserable, each day... the LOSER who's soul is blackened from Love lost ...and from being forgotten about by the entire Female species... Satan must have butt fucked you repeatedly \"god\" the day you spend me forth into this shitpile, to suffer and struggle, and in the end, die of some unspeakably terrifying disease... he must've made you suffer god, that miserabl<b> e blac</b>k day 50+ years ago... life hol<b> ds nothi</b>ng but death for me now, alone, unwanted, and Unloved... just pull the trigger, for Christ sake... all I see is young, good looking couples in love, feeling so blessed to have each other... sure, I've been with girls, but never one, the one, whom I wanted to be the mother of my child... never got to have that moment, where she looks in my eyes, and says, \"oh my god, I Love you!\" Remember you cruel bastard, you let me find her in 1984, and, for 6 months, you let me be the happiest man on the face of the earth... then you saw to it that in the period of one month, she would turn down my marriage proposal and get on a jet and move to California... and you know the 30+ years I've lived since... the LOSER cute girls laugh at... they know what a man whose soul is dying of LONLINESS looks like... and young, pretty girls go out of their way, to make it Chrystal clear, that they w<b> ant noth</b>ing to do with you...<b>  too</b> old<b> , to</b>o fat too short too tall too broke, too crippled... to imperfect, to be in their life... well I've had it, fucker.. pull your golden fucking trigger, or I will.... soon...",

Although people can change and turn to the Lord and ,  yet it is u to other to forgive or not. So if they do not feel they are repentant, and they want to stay away ( under that condition) it would be different...... totally \n\nBUT that is NOT the reason most are left, it is just selfishness on other people's part and guilt make people angry that they are being persecuted for their wrongs. Often even the <b> elderly </b>will try to find what they did to make the family not come and that is exactly what people want it to appear to be the reason, often. So sometimes it may be really the reason but often it is making that appearance , and hurting their parents who showed them all the love they cold. They are NOT perfect as on parents EVER is perfect and will make mistakes. BUT that condition of abuse stems from something that that parents lived through that caused it and maybe THEY er ABUSED TOO, and that caused them to not know any different and thought it was right?? One NEVER knows HOW the parents grew up and learned. Or what Genes lurk., So if we do not understand it, we cannot judge it properly. BUT we do have EVERY right to stay away under those circumstances and not put their own children through it, and that is understandable if true.  Making sure the parent has learned and now knows and is forgiven ,can help them forgive themselves, as they may 'now' know? IF NOT< than you have every reason to walk on. \n\nJust saying People CAN change, Maybe it was all they ever knew themselves growing up? Or the WAR can do it too . have seen many people come home from war and entirely different person. usually something is wrong inside of that person that know one knows they needed help , and should have gotten it, but often will not accept it. \n\nYou cannot allow an abuser to continue to abuse you though. I would need to end. They are hurting inside too and something is wrong one cannot tell as you cannot read their mind or know what they went through . But if easier and only thing possible to do, yes walk on. \n\nThis is altogether different and NOT the normal reason people are left alone.",

But abuse is not good and can understand that .  Just giving up and walking away, is plain selfish and cold.  Grown adults learn to forgive and try over and communicate why they feel upset over waht they do etc first. \n\nParents can get dementia at early ages they could show beginning signs. So young adults should not just jump to conclusion their parents are just \" bad people\" and throw them away. There could be something going on and they do not even realize it? Dr's need to do the RIGHT tests to find this out and often they are not done as they are costly etc. Sometimes the Dr would not know as they may not catch the problem with short visits at the office? It takes living with someone or even visiting often or for a period of time. Talking with the Dr can help, as a child of the parent you would have a right to talk to the Dr about what you are seeing and hearing, and any concerns you may have. He/she may not be able to give you information to their care in depth, but could at least consider your concerns, and watch for the problems mentioned next time your parent goes to Dr? Or asking correct questions to see how parent respond , or requesting tests to be done ,etc. Better than just walking away never talking again! Not having any closure, or trying to mend fences and understand and forgive, can cause a soul rift, and illness, and grief and death, through the grief and loneliness. ( Proven scientifically true). We all need love and understanding. It is in the genes.",

Do you have some way for the older person to recieve some sort of counselling or support to see how they harming you and to change their behaviour? Or would you get support to cope from somewhere? What provision is made to enable someone, who is trying to help a very difficult and draining <b> elderly </b>parent, to continue coping, because obviously if they are made ill by the stress of it all they will not be able to continue helping? Im interested to learn how people & communities cope. Im not suggesting that anyone should be shouting, disrespectfully at an<b>  elderly</b> parent or anything like that, but surely sometimes there is a need to quietly ask someone not to behave in a certain way as it is causing stress or distress? Sometimes people do not realise how much distress they are causing until they are told.",

It really sad that in this world today a lot of irresponsible people keep having children they can't afford to then these children become mess up adult. There is <b> nothing </b>more beautiful in this world than loving a child but if you're in a situation where you are not ready to raise a child yet then don't have it. Do not let the peer pressure of the society letting you making a decision that can really ruin your life and the kid life. Statistics show about 1/3 millennials are living with their parent and what does this mean? There is a study that the next generation and the one after that there will more and more people choose to be childfree due to many reason large family will be a minority living alone will be the new norm. \nShow less",

My Mom and Dad was always helping, my brothers Son and his girlfriend. They wanted money, all the time. And my parents, gave it to them. They used it to get drunk on , or buy pot, Well that is unacceptable,  so there's just so much bull, a person can stand. Maybe that person knew her Sister? Help yes, sometimes, but also know when to draw the line! Thank God my parents finally woke up. When my mom was <b> old </b>and I'll. Do you think they ever come to see her? No !!!!  They did not.

But out of selfishness they convince themselves that they would be better off in a home. Social media has made all ages more isolated . Chatting online can never take the place of person to person contact . Another reason is people don't trust other people anymore , too many horror stories in the news. Families live too far apart .society is geared toward the young . Churches don't visit widows anymore like the Bible says to do . The last reason is that the older people are no respected for their wisdom any longer , because the younger people think they have it all figured out and feel that older people are outdated .",

My dad lived alone in his apartment and has no friends. Some days he'll go to the grocery store but might even leave his hearing aid at home. He doesn't have a cellphone and he doesn't make phone calls. I moved back recently and anytime my door opens he'll get so excited to talk to me like a puppy wanting to play!

It is volunteer positions and people just help in anyway possible to keep programs running well with activities director. Working with nursing etc but doing it on your own time as possible. Some can do more than others. Many <b> elderly </b>homes ,could use this type of thing, if they do not have it. They could use 'volunteers' to work with the activities departments or to help<b>  elderly</b> write greeting cards, or to write letters. To call family, or learn computers, to have parties , thinking of ideas.  Teaching crafts, Much more can be done if the administration agrees. Playing music, Singing, any kind of talent you may have could be provided. Playing cards or teaching it, or getting them to share their memories and goals while at the home, what would they like to do?  Just visiting could be a wonderful help?",

It is funny how that touch or look of a female / male contact , no mater the ages can cause a spark seen by their face brightening up, eyes lighting us too! People need it. They say INFANTS THRIVE If handled and held in love with caring hands after birth. Yet some are left alone at a hospital and the parents  walks away and maybe leaving the baby to deal with drugs and the pain of addictions. Abortion kills the baby in the womb in a horrific way and they are alive and can FEEL, yet they are Burned with an acid type liquid. Not wanted at all. Later though, the mom grows up and matures ,and one day realizes what they did and forever remember the pain of it all. The soul cries out for help and only can go to the Lord and ask forgiveness for the death of their child before birth. \n\nMany times we do things that hurt others,and do not realize it because of selfishness, not looking at the love another can bring, even if they are vulnerable too, just like us. Sometimes the mom can never have other children and that 'would have been the ONLY one,' or maybe an 'adoption could have taken place and brought such love to 'another couple' who is dying inside, 'for the love of the very child' this person who had the abortion,  'would have' given birth to, even if they felt it would not be what they feel they could handle' at that time 'of their life? But someone else 'would be able and ready' to \"do just that \" and maybe the baby could find happiness and love? \n\nWe just do not  always think,  about 'others'  Reaching out to another with love in our hearts make such a difference and not just thinking of ourselves. is always the \"best way\" We can look back one day knowing we did ' The best we could, and not the selfish thing.\"",

                    "commentText": "Quite right.  I have lived alone since my divorce and for the first four years I felt very  abandoned. However, I threw myself on the Lord andcputvmy trust in him.  I am now 73 and so this is 18 years later.  But to be honest, I never feel lonely, by could do with a little help now and then, but there again, I don't want the Soc. round  interfering !\n If a person believes in Jesus and will accept that they need him as their Saviour things can vastly change ! \n,  For example John chapter  14 verrses.  23 to 25  states what Jesus said :. \" if any many love s me he will keep my Word, and my Father will LOVE him and we will come to him and  MAKE. OUR  HOME. WITH  HIM.\".   Isn't that a wonderful thought  ?  \n Unfortunately,  these people do not know Jesus, and have not received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, which is a personal gift when we repent of going our own way, and it would appear  that lonely <b> old </b>people  do not  HAVE  a knowledge of God , .  Having faith, and the knowledge of what Jesus has done for us and the joy of his prescence would give such<b>  old</b> people hope and a renewed meaning to life ! .  \n  Naturally, there are circumstances and events we miss, for example in my case, I miss my beautiful Bosendorfer grand piano, on which I played Beethoven and all the great !  But I believe whatever we loose in life, we will gain again perhaps in other ways , but dwelling on losses is being a defeatist.   We have to move on.",

I am busy with my busineas and going home at 8 pm makes me happy when my      dogs meet me at the gate. It is not typical for an Asian to live alone. I don't want tv anymore, I prefer you tube at night watching funny videos of dogs and cats before going to sleep. But many times I cried, because I regret for the kind of life I have now.  Sometimes I am scared when  heard loud bark from my dogs thinking bad guys are  planning bad on my home.",

However it still is considered going against values and morals. In the west however - and im sure there are exceptions- it is the norm - children dont really care/value their parents' happiness. In my view, i dont care if u r a surgeon or nobel prize winner- if you've left ur parents i<b> n ol</b<b> >d a</b>ge in such a state u r a piece of crap- especially ur mum who bared the brunt of giving birth to you.  \n\nWhile how I feel about my parents is more culturally motivated than religiously; The Prophet Muhammed said, Heaven lies under the feet of your mother.",

Like \"Water everywhere and yet not a drop to drink\"  If able, get a pet , that you can cherish and hold. Sometimes volunteering ( If not too tired after working or anything else you do)  helps as ' doing for other's really helps ourselves. There is joy in watching other people have fun. \n\nIt does not ever ' take the place of\" those you really want around, but it certainly can help. believe me there are many more lonely people now than ever. \n\nEveryone is so \"busy\" no one has time for \"REAL people\" standing or sitting beside them. They are AFRAID of REAL company that is right with them . Finding a way to reach out to a group with \"real people\" not facebook or Twitter etc really does do alot for anyone. IF they are able to do this?\n\nJust a thought of what I have seen helpful. Do not know about you, but I find so much I can do to keep myself busy, that helps too. Maybe it just takes me longer to do what I used to?? LOL",

I know the feeling of being lonely and in islam loneliness is forbidding. You have to be around your brothers and sisters ( in the faith and biological ones). Islam teaches unity.

It's a sad truth, but now-a-days most churches do not cater to the <b> elderly/</b>widows/divorced. They don't go visit them and care little about them -the only concern is if they pay their tithes. So sad. I use to visit<b>  elderly</b> and they loved my company b/c I keep them laughing about something. But, over the years, I've found myself just trying \"to live\" and pay bills and haven't had extra time to go out and spend time with th<b> e elderl</b>y. Seeing this vid makes me sad, b/c I feel that I'm not able to do my part in helping t<b> he elder</b>ly. I pray something gives.",

Yes, they care and visit, phone etc but I don't moan about my aches and pains to them, don't sit in a corner feeling sorry for myself either.  My son dragged me into the 21st century by making me take an interest in the internet, and I am glad he did Most info for things to do etc are on line now, and there is skype.  I find though most people mu <b> age </b>group somehow don't want to adapt to a changing world. Don't get me wrong, there is an awful lot wrong with the world now, but its still good to be engaged . Only issue I have is with the DWP forcing me to work five years longer. when right now I should be enjoying my retirement and spending the winter with my daughter who lives in Florida!",

Many, if not most, will solely blame a persons <b> mental </b>health ( Anixety, Depression, etc. ) and dismiss any needed personnel action, and \"Yes\", sometime those Medical Issues are part of the problem. However, due to the many variations of why a person is lonely it is nearly impossible to address them all. I, for one, have Medically Diagnosed,  Anxiety, Depression, and the stinker - Bipolar.  I live alone and roughly 90% of my interaction with people is on Social Media, of one sort or the other. You can't \" help the world \" Sophia, however if you but take just one person into your life, who you judge to be lonely, you will have done a world of good.",

We are all each and everyone of us responsible for our thoughts and actions. No one else. Not your family. Not your ex-spouse that left you. Not that random person on the train who upset you today. Not your crappy boss. Not your neighbour next door whom you cannot stand. And  not feminism. YOU. Only you are responsible. No fate but what we make for ourselves.\n\"Watch your thoughts, they become you words. Watch your words, they become your actions. Watch your actions, they become your destiny\".",
