        "postText": "The conversation around trans people and our bodies is one of the media\u2019s current play toys.', 'From discussions around our ability to exist in certain spaces, to how we shop and do other mundane activities, we are put under the microscope for just existing.', 'As a gender non-conforming person, it\u2019s hard for me to understand not only why we are constantly on newspaper front pages but why we are actively being shut out of the conversation entirely.', 'Why are trans people not being allowed to authentically share their lived experiences within the turbulent media landscape that we find ourselves drowning in?', 'Earlier this week, I turned on the radio for some light-hearted relief as I sat down to a mountain of emails, and tuned in to an unexpected show about trans people, specifically trans children.', 'Callers from across the country were ringing in to offer their opinions on the topic.', 'The worst thing about this wasn\u2019t the random surprise of hearing a community I hold dear being spoken about on air, but the fact that callers were allowed to share vile transphobic vitriol that went unchallenged.', 'At no point did the host argue against callers \u2013 including one who said that \u2018men can\u2019t just identify as women\u2019, which is a severely transphobic comment \u2013 but instead simply continued to highlight that this topic is clearly something \u2018that people have strong opinions on\u2019.', 'This is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to discussions around our identities \u2013 the media landscape for trans people over the past two years has been an absolute nightmare.', 'From headlines depicting perfectly happy couples as \u2018Tran and Wife\u2019 to continued scaremongering about women\u2019s only spaces such as changing rooms and the infiltration of \u2018men\u2019 in these environments, we are perpetually being discussed by cisgendered heterosexual people.', 'Our inherently basic and everyday habits such as shopping, visiting the doctor and getting the tube \u2013 where we do sometimes encounter problems \u2013 are suddenly turned into a hostile talk about whether or not we\u2019re even supposed to be there in the first place.', 'And that\u2019s just written journalism. TV debates are a whole new ball game.', 'They open us up to conversations that are less filtered and more likely to include transphobic commentators who fill the screen time with their entitled opinions. And this isn\u2019t just specific to certain channels or demographics.', 'The trans debate has taken over all mainstream channels, with Channel 4\u2019s Genderquake and subsequent car crash of a debate the elephant in the room among trans people when we discuss the media and all its tropes.', 'This wasn\u2019t only an example of how to profile trans people in a sensationalist way, but showed us how mainstream channels still don\u2019t seem to understand that putting trans people in positions that are both unsafe and offer mass exposure isn\u2019t enough.', 'We don\u2019t want to be thrown into the lion\u2019s den when it comes to sharing our lived experiences.', 'Our inherently basic and everyday habits such as shopping, visiting the doctor and getting the tube \u2013 where we do sometimes encounter problems \u2013 are suddenly turned into a hostile talk about whether or not we\u2019re even supposed to be there in the first place.', 'History will serve true as we look back on the treatment of people such as Munroe Bergdorf and Fox and Owl on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain. Their motivations to highlight incredibly important experiences on what it\u2019s like to navigate the world as trans and non-binary, were flipped on their heads, and turned into what can only be described as a battle.', 'Owl themself spoke to me about the trans inclusion in British media and said: \u2018To me it just seems like a given that if you\u2019re talking about trans people, you make sure they are included and their voices are heard.', '\u2018They\u2019re the experts on their own lives and experiences. Giving platforms to voices that have no relevance, qualifications, or have ever worked with trans people isn\u2019t going to be helpful, and that\u2019s how prejudice and misinformation gets peddled out.\u2019', 'This is far too common and something that is strangely very easy to change.', 'Allowing trans people to speak about themselves is step one, and is so unbearably obvious, I can\u2019t believe I even have to write it. Step two is to ensure that we are safe in these circumstances.', 'Putting us up against someone who is questioning our literal existence isn\u2019t \u2018in the nation\u2019s interest\u2019 or doing a service to the \u2018many people who have concerns\u2019.', 'It\u2019s allowing transphobic views a platform to be heard \u2013 as if our identities and expressions are comparable to \u2018should we put sugar in our tea?\u2019 or \u2018is the vegan sausage roll as good as the meat version?\u2019', 'There are many people, like myself, who use their words to provide an honest and truthful viewpoint on, in my case, a non-binary existence.', 'It\u2019s about time we were taken seriously and not made to constantly fight for empathy.",

I will certainly agree that mocking somebody or intentionally upsetting somebody is completely wrong but to try and police how a person thinks when they see someone is equally wrong on an Orwellian level.In the Emperor's New Clothes people were afraid to tell the king what they could really see and even convinced themselves because of social pressure they couldn't see his true form underneath but once the little boy actually spoke up and the crowd joined in, the Emperor got on with the procession anyway without covering up.I have mentioned this on another Metro article but I feel it is important that people learn to accept themselves in the skin they are in without feeling the need to project something else to the outside world. People as individuals should feel empowered to just be themselves the way they were born. It should certainly not be societys job to cater for the disparity between the body a person wants and what they have.Love who you are inside.",

The proposed changes makes the process easier and more transparent.

And I never deliberately or knowingly discriminate against anyone in this life. But reading this article, I have to ask a couple of questions. You say tha<b> t Transgende</b>r people are \"Constantly on newspaper front pages\". I can't recall seeing any thing abo<b> ut transgend</b>er people on newspaer front pages. In the last 6 months or so, and probably further back, the front pages of all the newspapers I've seen on display have been about Southern ra<b> il, Bre</b>xit, or disgraced MPs going to prison. To be fair, I've not actively looked for article<b> s on transge</b>nder people, but I've certainly not seen any on the newspaper front pages.You also talk about turning the radio on and hearing a talk show <b> about Transg</b>ender people. I understand that it must be extremely upsetting to listen to other people that, presumably, have no experience or knowledge of what it's like<b>  to be trans</b>gender, or the things that you have to go through, giving their, (uneducated), opinion on your feelings and how you should act and haow you should live your life etc. I know that I would feel very agrieved at that. But were there no contriutions fromtransgender people on this show ? Did no one phone in to say that th<b> ey were tran</b>sgender, or that their child/sibling/best fr<b> iend was tra</b>nsgender ? Of course, I do understand that the producers/host of the show might have blocked them. My questions are not loaded, or rhetorical. They are genuine. I'm open to having a proper discussion about it and to be educated, (in small doses. I'm not known for my intellect or for my patience. I'm not that bright and I do loose concentration easily if I'm out of my depth.",

Trans men and women are normal every day people wanting to get on with their lives and those added to TV need to represent that. Rather than looking like a drag art exhibit. Sadly it's the kooky ones that bring in the views.",
