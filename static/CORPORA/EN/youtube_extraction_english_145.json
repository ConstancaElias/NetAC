I struggle attracting guys that are in my <b> age </b>range (30s). I recognized that it's the vibe one puts out or they can sense that you want a relationship. It's always the opposite effect. If you don't want something, you'll get it anyway. If you want something, you won't get it.  However, if you're looking for a significant other, you may have to readjust your preferences. Our preferences is what's causing<b>  ga<b> y</b</b>> men to miss out on the opportunities to date and possibly be in a relationship. If you want a relationship, you may have to seek an older man. Or, find a guy that share the same interests and go from there. It's difficult when you're an individual that's self-aware and finding someone that is a compliment on both sides.",

            "commentText": "I'm 25 currently and while I'm not in the <b> age </b>range you're talking about, I have thought about this myself. Speaking for myself, I don't mind guys in their 30s because I genuinely believe that older men (and 30 isn't<b>  old</b> in my opinion) can look great and I feel that older men know what they're looking for and are more open to actual relationships instead of constant hookups. I know that there are older men who want to play the bachelor life until they can't get it up anymore but typically, I find that older men are more open to settling down compared to younger guys.\n\nI don't attract many guys to begin with but I've noticed all too often that a lot of younger guys are only interested in hooking up as much as they can because you know, sowing the oats and whatnot. This in turn can turn off some young guys who actually want to have a relationship and thus, they may open up to older men because like I mentioned earlier, they tend to be more susceptible and open to relationships. \n\nBut I also agree that it's important to have some things i<b> n commo</b>n with. I have met with a few guys significantly older than me (55 when I was 19) and the one glaring thing I've noticed is we couldn't connect on a personal basis. We both grew up at different times and different things were trending. Like for example animation, something I'm really into. He's into the cartoons that came out of the 1950s-1970s and I'm more into the stuff that came out in the late 1980s to the 2000s. Same with music. He liked Classic rock, I like 90s Alt Rock/Grunge lol So like you, ideally I'd like to find someone within <b> my a</b>ge. 5, maybe 10 years give or take.\n\nBack on the topic at hand, I do think that top/bottom can play into this as well. I've heard and seen time and again of older more dominant men trying to get younger guys and vice versa. I think it's the guys who are more versatile-minded that don't do this as much. \n\nAnyway just my own 2 cents.",

My husband is more than 30 years older than me, and, if anything, our love has only grown stronger. Let's say \"unfortunately, much, and I do mean MUCH has changed since then\"..for many people. For those who follow the easy path of vain and immediate reward. In their defense, I'd say they are unaware other ways are possible out of experience and or lack of examples they could relate to.
