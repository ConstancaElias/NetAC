', 'Now millennials, who recently voiced their offence at 1990 s sitcom Friends, have taken to Twitter again to criticise older Bond movies.', 'One wrote: Watching old James Bond movies and realised: Dude was low key a rapist.', 'Another said: In the early films, James Bond was a full on rapist!#goldfinger.', While one tweet read: Watching old school Sean Connery James Bond movies. He's basically a rapist who occasionally murders a Russian person. ', 'But it\u2019s not just the character of 007 millennials have a problem with, it\u2019s supporting roles and the general tone of the movies too.', 'One said: Watching The Man With The Golden Gun and good lordddd the fact that they thought the hyper-racist sheriff character was a fun/wacky presence to bring back speaks volumes.', 'A Twitter user added: If the millennials think Friends is sexist they should watch James Bond [movie] A View to Kill they will go nuts.', 'In contrast a new book by a University Professor claims that James Bond wasn\u2019t sexist, but a stylish commando.', 'In The World of James Bond historian Jeremy Black, Professor at University of Exeter said: Bond was a very modern man for the 1950s. This was the pre-pill age, but he admires women who offer sex, femininity and masculinity. His women are independent and driven.', ' He is a far more complex and interesting character in the books than in the films.In the films the Bond Girls are stunning, and with startling regularity acquiesce with a sigh of Oh James, which has fed 007\u2019 s reputation as an arch misogynist.'",
