That is a man.\u2019', 'Jessica Dare has since written apology letters to her victims and described her own actions as \u2018horrendous\u2019, Chester Magistrates Court heard.', 'The 47-year-old has pleaded guilty to three counts of assault \u2013 but stressed she had been out drinking and did not remember what happened.', 'The two trans women were singing karaoke at Oddfellows Arms in Chester on September 29 when Dare insulted them, the court heard.', 'One of the victims confronted Dare \u2013 who grabbed her by the neck in response.', 'During the ensuing fight, Dare, of Upton, in Chester, Cheshire, struck the other woman on the side of the face.', 'The third assault took place outside the pub on the same evening.', 'Dare made further comments towards a non-trans victim and committed another assault.', 'Since then, Dare has stated her regret in letters to the victims and, after being shown CCTV footage, described her actions as \u2018horrendous\u2019, her solicitor said.', 'She was fined \u00a3335, ordered to pay \u00a3250 compensation to her three victims, handed a 12-month community order and given a curfew for nine weeks.', 'In January, LGBT charity Stonewall revealed more than a third of all transgender people in the UK have been victims of a hate crime in the past 12 months.', 'Campaigners branded the statistics the \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019, as they claim many other victims do not feel safe to even report their attacks.",
