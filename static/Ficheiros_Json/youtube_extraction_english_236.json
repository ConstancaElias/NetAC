 "postText": " Last month Chinese students at Columbia University in New York City were targeted by racist vandals who ripped the name tags bearing their Chinese names off dorm doors. So they made a video about what their Chinese name means to them. They explain how it went viral. Filmed by Max Toomey and edited by Joshua Lim. Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog.

In China, foreigners are considered second class citizens, and they got a lot fewer rights than native Chinese.... So, they are asking not to be treated the way they treat foreigners in China!!! And they speak up subjects they wouldn't dare to even mention in China. That's all... It would be better if BBC would make research before releasing a propaganda spot.",

    "commentText": "While I am against racism in all forms against all people, China itself is the most racist country on Earth.  Even China's name in Chinese Zhonghou which is often translated as \"Middle Kingdom\" means a bit more than that: it means the country at the center of the world.  They believe, even the \"communist\" that China is still the center of the world.  And China has a police of Hanism, which Mao Zedong was actually against, that believes Han people and culture are the best.  China is putting into that idea into action against other Chinese ethnic groups, the Uygur being the best example but it can be seen in other groups as well.  China is also HIGHLY, I had to capitalize, racist against Africans instead of being open to them and other historically maligned groups and refugees.  They even have separate Chinese and African bathrooms and Chinese only restaurants IN AFRICA, sorry again for capitalizing.  I could go on and on but look it up yourself and see for yourself.  :)\n\nJust wait though, the replies will be full of Chinese 50cent army(a network of Chinese trolls paid by the government of China the equivalent of 50cents for every pro-China post) saying that US or Europe is racist for what it did in the past.  The key word is past unlike China who is doing it today and who denies it even happens when there is overwhelming evidence unlike the US and Europe who acknowledge it.  :)",

Little did I know how racist the Chinese are,  until I encountered a Chinese racist, it was a brutal experience and this happened in Europe. Thank God the west is in charge, otherwise I think if the Chinese rule they'll kill everybody including white men and enslave white women for sex, because of their obsession with white beauty",

Not once, but the whole group no matter Black american, Black uk, Black australia,etc..they're standing up for their right, for their people!!\nwhile Asian is silly, when they're facing racist, they're just laughing like nothing & think go ahead so everything will be okay. NOTHING WILL BE CHANGING IF YOURE NOT FIGHTING FOR YOUR OWN RIGHTS.\ndarkest day of black history - slave, do you think just by words without fighting Black take back freedom & treat better just like today. No, black have to fighting for it, working for it to earn freedom.\nAsian in Westerners country when get racist & bully, they're just go away in silent. Even themself & others Asian just walking by, noone stand up for help. Noone raise a voice!! Noone standup together to asking stop racist toward to Asian\nDo you think only saying & crying, this problems will solves. I don't support violent, hateful racist back to each other's, but sometime only doing something harsh is the only way!!",

If you really want to make changes equally make changes back in China. Stop generalizing non Chinese as foreigner, as if no other culture but Chinese culture matters, stop shouting Hallow at peoples backs in the street. Stop creating segregated housing, saying black foreigners can't rent here, but white foreigners can, or foreigners not allowed to this area because of military racially profiling as a group of Korean friend that went first are allowed to enter. Before addressing U.S. issues it would be great if you could make social change and reform in your own home country. Since non-Chinese are not allowed a voice in China. Think, Do you think its fair a Chinese can become an American but a American can't Become Chinese. The policies and social construction of China is far more racist then that of the U.S.¬†even though¬†the U.S. is extreme in its own racial issues, take this as a learning situation back home to make changes please let people know its not ok to label people as foreign or Chinese each person has their own culture, language and way of life, skin color should not determine how much a person gets paid ect. ect. you just had a name removed life as a non Asian in China is far more traumatizing then what you went through.",

    "commentText": "For me growing up in a poor black area, internalised racism is black children enacting gangster culture. The media overwhelmingly paints black people in negative ways and these children come to internalise these images, and it becomes part of their identity formation. Studious black people?? Hardly ever seen, so these kids become disengaged from education and are more interested in being a gangster because to them that is cool. That is expected. Humans are mostly conformist, just look at conformity experiments here on Youtube, you can have people stand up when a bell rings in a doctors office just because others are seen doing it repeatedly. I KNOW Of this form of racism  BECAUSE I LIVED THIS. I went to a majority black school and was educated in this rebellious lifestyle. The people around me aspired to be cool, they thought they were rebelling against a system that wasn't for them, but hey were only eleven, so I doubt they had a true understanding of what this meant, only that they should be lawless in order to rebel (they sometimes expressed this vocally). Having a competitive personality I was keen to impress my peers. It did not matter what was to be sought after, had the school culture been to strive for high achievement, I would have strived. That was not the culture, so the school was extremely bad, each of us trying to act as cool as possible. Oh you are going to skip class! Oh My God, you are soooo cool! They looked up to me and I was popular. Black children who wanted to work hard were absolutely ridiculed and bullied, I was certainly not going to be seem in that light! unfavourably! I realised it was a trap when my sister's year left the school and were still hanging out on the street. I wondered where their life would go? Was shocked and felt set-up. It was like smoke and mirrors that lead to no where. So I woke up and completed five years of work in one year to ensure I could pass school and get into college. I went to college and found the joy of learning - I got all A's. I was sad about all the years I COULD HAVE BEEN LEARNING, I am still sad up to this day! I went to university and now, existing in this world, I no longer feel empowered, I did as a rebellious youth, subscribing to that I felt alive! During this time I believed I lived in a post-racist society. Now I work in spaces where I am judged, looked down on etc. Without anyone having even spoken to me yet. It is one of the most draining and depressing experiences! It is the biggest system of oppression facing black people right now and it is one that has them killing each other or ended up incarcerated. So black people are not free if they internalise a culture that will have them locked up. They are still lynched if they are being killed, even if it is by someone that looks just like them. it is quite a genius system tbh, ruthless and insidious, but of course the most evil thing that exists to keep a people down!  Studying Psychology and understanding how we come to see ourselves and others come to see us, it fascinates me that this is the case. I have no doubt that this system has been designed intentionally, and you only feel the oppression of it when you do not enact it, when you uphold it you feel empowered, probably how white people feel on a day to day basis carrying out their norms. I feel more respected on gym days in a tracksuit than on work days in a suit. I am being unauthentic, not operating in my position of blackness. It is crazy because I used to actually see black people in a suit and judged them this way, shouting to them that they are a coconut. It is truly sad that black identity has been shaped as ghetto/gangster identity! I hope we can liberate our young people from this system of oppression.\n\nYou simply don't understand the systems of oppression facing black people, including in black countries, where it is so underdeveloped that black students leave to come and help build up another nation. \n\nIntelligence is coding for by 100s of genes unlike phenotypes which is controlled by only a few. Intelligence does vary throughout the population but is not determined by skin colour. I have met and worked with smart and less intelligent people from ALL ethnicities. This is a weak argument for the state of black people. Scientist have even said there is no scientific basis to race because genes vary widely between people. I am sure you have all encountered people that look like you who have different personalities and levels of intelligence. Sometimes you can meet someone who doesn't even look like you and yet they have more in common with you personality wise...\n\nSome group claim to be so smart but are subscribing to outdated ideologies and helping to oppression other human-beings. The world disgust me, but I don't care about this, I care about fighting racism that affects black and brown people of colour.",

    "commentText": "The BBC are unbelievable. The Chinese, forgive my generalization, are one of the most racist ethnic groups and nationalities in the world. I have been living in China for 5 years, and everyday I take a moment to relax myself before going outside because I need to prepare to endure a barrage of abuse from people laughing directly into my face, trying to walk into me deliberately, and thats on a good day if im not being extorted. Please see through the face game. If you say even something innocuous they take objection to, there will be all hell to pay, but they will come to your country and start forcing demands on you. Wise up. There is a big difference between indiscriminate racism and necessary probabilistic generalizations which are usually true.",

I always said that Canadian people are not racists  but the trick is that I did not know what is racism exactly ! Racism is not only when somebody punches you in the face or insults you ! Racism is also when you leave comments on YouTube and 99% of the time you do not get any likes or answers, and when you come back you find 100 people who left comments after you having 100s of likes and comments ! People ignoring is racism too ! When nobody calls you if you do not call them it is racism too ! I had 20 contacts on my phone and Viber and I always had conversations with them, then I got the idea to check the discussion history and I found out I was always the one who started the conversations, so I decided to make my experiment and stop sending messages first...1 years after only 1 of the contacts sent me a lazy \"hey\" ! This is racism ! Especially when you go on Facebook and you find out they were contacting each others and hanging out together without you ! Canada is so racist, but coward racist not like french, french people are openly racists. Chinese people are the most racist people on this planet, my people also. We are all racists, racism must be fought and banned from this planet, we are all responsible of it !",

Don‚Äôt k how to speak English to so therefore can‚Äôt help u order food 2. It‚Äôs exclusively not for foreigners bc they may be serving food that foreigners cannot stand to eat that locals enjoy, to those black people don‚Äôt think ur the only race that is denied being access, there‚Äôs also white people as well. You can also see that in Korea and japan. And when we call you black, please don‚Äôt be offended bc you are black right? And when they say that it isn‚Äôt build on racism, they never k abt how u guys were degraded or were as slaves. So they don‚Äôt treat u as such. Calling all Chinese racist is also stereotyping.",

Humble yourselves and stop acting like China is the most superior country in the world. Contribute to the community of all people, not only to yourselves.

China is indeed progressing, but you should read some news and actually go the country before you make any comments about its sincerity and the degree of its contribution. I like Koreans just like how the other races are as we are all equal, and I agree with your idea that people should contribute to the society.

Education is the way forward stop looking at black as though their bad unclean people we are the first people of this earth yet everything we had as been white washed through hierarchy in colourising people. Take a good look at your own racism of others especially BLACK People. Your race are no better than the Europeans who have wiped out their own and still are wiping out others. One day I‚Äôd like to say The Jamaican national motto ‚ÄúOut of Many One People', based on the population's multiracial roots. Yet still this won‚Äôt happen in my life time. I work for the Asians yet still I am discriminated by rich customers who fob me off because of my skin tone still stating white is beautiful. Please take a long hard look at your race of people who are ignorant, racist and sexist etc yes from a angry black female who experiences racism every day from your people.

Guys, this immature, childish behaviour is just adding hate on hate, and we don't need that, especially in today's world. We have to work to build each other up, and NOT tear each other down. Just because some Chinese are racist, don't mean the whole group is that. This type of generalisation is a form of racism too, FYI. We all have a right to stand up for ourselves, as I'm doing now, as these Chinese students are doing. As long as its peaceful, harmonious and not being mean or rude. I'm not trying to defend the Chinese, or a particular group of people, I mean to say that for all of us on this earth, whether your Chinese, African, Indian or other nations/races. There is racism everywhere, not just in China or America, and each of our role is to stand up for what we believe in, in a ethically correct way, and disarming the hate, poverty and bad stuff that goes round, not adding fuel to fire. Think about my paragraph, and I hope you will reflect on it in a positive light. Don't spread hate, spread love and acceptance of each other instead!!",

    "commentText": "this breaks my heart SO MUCH because i resonate with them as well and because i am chinese too (cantonese¬†to be specific). my name in pinyin is a bit different than mandarin pinyin because we speak a different form of chinese, so our names are spelled differently. My chinese name is wen bao xing. wen is my family last name and bao means precious and xing means gentle, warm, and kind. And the fact that growing up, american kids would always ask me what my chinese name was right after they would ask me (all the time) what my ethnicity was so id tell them. Right after, they would instantly ridicule my name and proceed to make horrible and racist \"chinese accents\" to say my name and say ching chang chong. I felt so insulted, hurt, and completely disregarded and discriminated. Like my own culture and ethnic background is a complete joke to them. It was like MY OWN RACE AND ETHNIC CULTURE IS A COMPLETE JOKE OF EXISTENCE. LIKE THE BIRTH OF MY OWN RACE IS A JOKE AND MEANT TO BE ONE FOR EVERY OTHER RACE TO BASH ON AND MAKE FUN OF. My own heritage is one of the oldest civilizations in the world. We paved way for modern day development, technology, trade, and immersion of food and culture. How dare you disregard our race and treat us like trash. without china, america would be NOTHING.",

We all suffered extremely serious racist abuse behaviour and even physical violence by Chinese people in China: far more serious than anything described in this video. Serious physical assaults, threats, disapproving stares for those of us that had local girlfriends or boyfriends, refused in housing and house shares, ripped off and getting robbed were daily occurrences for us. Local people often refused to sit next to us on public transport, share elevators or gym equipment with us. Foreign females, particularly those of European descent suffered serious sexual assaults. Any students of black origin received the most appalling abuse on a daily basis. Many mainland Chinese people have an extremely and increasingly ultranationalist and abhorrent world view: this video is a serious distraction from this and does not even explore these themes.",

Foreign students also have monthly cash subsidies from the government and lower standards to pass exams.

Still, I'm interested in which city do you live and work in to give you these kind of feelings, maybe it's the place, China is a big country.",

I've seen parents thought some passengers are Americans speaking English, telling that to their kids while they are actually speaking Spanish. But I guess you're true in some situations, because there are people tend to avoid being near to strong looking persons, especially foreigners. Some of them believe that if they get troubles with foreigners they can't talk through it. Most Chinese can't speak and understand English well, they don't even speak mandalin properly.",

I just came back from China a couple of days ago on my first trip there and I wouldnt say that China was inherently racist but I would say that there was a weariness and suspicion of foreign people particularly black people. Its sad particularly given that black people dont have a history of oppressing and mass murdering other groups unlike other groups that I can mention and many black people that I know have a positive opinion of Chinese people and would go to China if it wasnt for concerns for the racism that they may face.",

They have been burned alive and hung hourly. No Asian ever came out to protest in their favor. Instead the are proud to discard their native names and revert to themselves as kathy and Michelle. While blacks fought and died to get rid of miscegenation laws they still stood on the sidelines and waited until the dust settled to finally have an opportunity to Maryy Dave and chad only because the black civil rights movement prevailed . Furthermore, chocolate people continue to march in the streets protesting unarmed killings of chocolate people, and no where in those protest do you see Asian people helping. Maybe a few lynchings and live burnings will wake these people up. Sadly, I predict they will still shun their history, their names, and purchase blue contacts because they have a deep desire to be, and be with these same people who do these disgusting acts. Good on them.",

I do have a handful of really great chinese friends... but as u said a lot are strongly racist. If it is pointed out to them they will 1) try to shift blame to others(on whites). 2) You are too sensitive if u don't like go back . But when it comes to them, they are furious e.g D&G case, Virgin airlines case.(white worship) and want their rights without going back. 3) They will also try to reason it out saying their racist behavior is for their protection against black as they have a reputation of crime or 4) in ancient china it was believed that black skin is a sign of working in the fields so in 2019 it still means every darker skin person is a poor farmer LOLZ!!! Also that means farmers are ugly dirty and should be avoided!!! If all fails its 5) \"you guys don't know the depth and value of our culture so u wont understand\" .... when cross countered with.... \"ok I am curious to learn, explain\" ...6) \"forget it\" - is their reply to evade. Happened so many times now i got so used to this sequence of justifying and evading their racism or in essence anything that they do not agree with. It has nothing to do with logical reasoning. They clearly see dark skin as some people as ugly, filthy, to look down upon.",

It seems that they aren't very clear about the circumstance and cultures in Singapore. I can say that Singaporean Chinese is a distinctive group of their own with a separate society and culture from the other Chinese. We share more common with Malaysian Chinese but even so there are still differences between our cultures. U should watch NOC, Jianhao Tan and Wah Banana or Ridhwan Azman etc, they're all Singaporean YouTubers and can help u get a grasp about the cultures in Singapore. Or Dankhoo or Jinnyboy, they're Malaysian YouTubers and can help u understand more about cultures in Malaysia.",

Imo, It is your expectations that is the problem.  When the Chinese immigrate to other countries, they usually pull their own weight and do not get alot of help or govt handouts the way other immigrants or visible ethnicities do.  In fact, many Asian immigrants are forced to be self-sufficient because they get very little assistance or recognition from others.",

The black people they have seen are from western media: heavily stereotyped roles where you guys are portrayed as thugs and criminals. Also, keep in mind they have a general distrust of outsiders. And don‚Äôt forget the classist implications of skin color in china- this is a country where people have just begun to get rich and money is the difference between two worlds. The geographic wealth gap is huge, and the poorer people in the countryside have darker skin. Yes, I know it‚Äôs racist, but it doesn‚Äôt mean Chinese culture and people are inherently bad. It‚Äôs human nature to keep to ones ‚Äúown‚Äù group UNLESS they have been taught otherwise. They are coming from a place of ignorance. Give them time, willing activists, and good policy, they will change for the better like the rest of the world did. People feel compassion for those who lack food and money, so why don‚Äôt they feel the same for those who lack knowledge?",

This interview is absolutely laughable in comparison to what goes on in China. The biggest difference is, in America, it's already wrong, which is why BBC covered it. In China you would be hard pressed to find the same content on racism. You hypocrites get no empathy from me. I want to see you post some content on the racism in China first, then I'll give you a look.",

I'm aware that many people in China are racist, but most Chinese-Americans aren't. Those kids were probably born in America and had NOTHING to do with racism in China. MAYBE there parents are racist but those kids didn't cause that. They also didn't cause people in China to hate African Americans.

But, I have been attacked by some chinese, with ALL DEROGATORY comments without offences, e.g. they deny that i am American by ethnics/ dna, eventhough the DNA test shows it. So they keep insisting to the others like to the USA government and also to the AU government etc etc.. with very very derogatory comments like calling me as Phillipino maids, or they insulted me for having multiple plastic surgeries, until I have fairer skin than them. While I never have those procedures to make me more beautiful than the chinese. They also keep attacking me, like I have to obey them, they said if I indeed have that chinese ancestries, then I have to accept any chinese guys as my spouse, even the bad ones, the unwanted ones by them. Also, they to the Japanese, they lied that I am korean, or phillipinos, etc. But behind the Japanese, they mistreat me somekind like a slave, by calling me deserve to be treated bad due to I am Japanese, or American. On the other occassions, they insult me that because I am American in ethnicities/ origins, then they would send false reports to the USA government to reject me and to deny me. So.. very very severe.. without offences.. I admitted that fewer times, I confronted them politely.. ... then they again twisted the things against me. I try to understand that any people able to do those, then they must have issues in their mind/ brain.",

Whether it's a bias or just straight up fuck [insert race or culture]. The environment you grow up in will also contribute to the way you see the world.  Using racism to fight racism is just trying to justify it. By saying thing like \"Chinese people are the most racist in the world.\" you are only adding to the flames.",

If people think that these students cannot defend themselves because of something that someone else did, that is just mean.

We all suffered extremely serious racist abuse behaviour and even physical violence by Chinese people in China: far more serious than anything described in this video. Serious physical assaults, threats, disapproving stares for those of us that had local girlfriends or boyfriends, refused in housing and house shares, ripped off and getting robbed were daily occurrences for us. Local people often refused to sit next to us on public transport, share elevators or gym equipment with us. Foreign females, particularly those of European descent suffered serious sexual assaults. Any students of black origin received the most appalling abuse on a daily basis. Many mainland Chinese people have an extremely and increasingly ultranationalist and abhorrent world view: this video is a serious distraction from this and does not even explore these themes.",

But western countries try to sell race concept, and want Asian countries to join, then beat them in their game. this is stupid.   there is no solution , as its not severe enough to start a war  in peaceful era.

They have strong Minds.\n\nWhites are scary to be a minority because they know how many evil things do around the world.

I know that not all Black people are bandits or criminals, but it's still difficult to approach them because of their reputation. It isn't really our fault for being cautious of Black people. For example, imagine you were on a train with a somewhat mental person. Now this person starts making all kinds of bizarre noises and crazy movements. While he may be harmless, you still wouldn't approach him/her. We all know that not all mental people are harmful or dangerous, but there's always that uncertainty. So you can't really blame us for being racist towards Blacks. Their reputation for crime causes uncertainty. This is our perspective.",

In my view as a black man neither Chinese nor western white people are extremely racist by definition. Most of the racism I've experienced in my life has come from Indians and Arabs. These two groups are the most racist in my opinion. Another point I would like to mention is that non black people on here need to stop using black people as a political football for how tolerant or intolerant they or other races are. Thanks.",

I went to study in China at Beijing Language and Culture University (now calledÂåó‰∫¨ËØ≠Ë®ÄÂ§ßÂ≠¶) in the 90's. Chinese people would try to cheat western students at every opportunity, even national regulations mandated that we had to pay more simply to visit tourist sites. Some of the swimming pools wouldn't let you in unless you were Chinese, or at least Asian. When walking along a street in Wangfujing with a female Chinese classmate, the local vendors angrily asked her \"why she didn't like Chinese people\". So if Chinese students honestly want to fight racism, the best place to start is right in their home country.",

It's very subjective to say that there is more racism against Chinese people than against black people when no other group other than native Americans have been oppressed as much since the founding of the United States in the 18th century.

While it is a huge problem to have our info blocked in China, I am sure that is something that people do not want but we cannot do anything about it. However, you can do something and should def so something if someone kept on tearing down your name that represents your country, yourself, your family, and your culture.

And 3 things i learned.... colorism is so part of they're cultures that they see it as a normal thing, common sense. They are almost as racist as white people and white people praising is they're favorite. Funny thing is, they go to the US, and find out white people are racist towards them too........thats ironic.",

Also, the job factor, they will flat out say if you are too dark we will not hire you even though your are qualified for the job. \n\nYup, there is racism everywhere, in Africa, Asian, America and Europe.",

Now, your argument is that 'Blacks are bad to all Asians'. So, you must be the only individual in this entire world to meet billions of blacks. Example: all the Blacks in North America, all Blacks in Europe, all the Blacks in Caribbean,  all the blacks in Fiji islands, all the blacks in \"54\" countries in Africa, all the blacks in middle east, all the blacks in Australia, all blacks in India,  all blacks in central and south america,and believe this there are blacks born in different countries in Asia., this includes those who are mixed race (asian &black)\n Now, because I like coherent debate, and your argument is lacking in that aspect.  I will leave you with this take home note.  \"Ignorance is by choice, do not choose to be ignorant because of racism or hate to lower your intelluctual aspect.‚àö",

And there are even racist chinese going to Africa for work, trying to replace Africans all the while practicing jim crow style racism.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkalHSdGQoo",

China is going to use debt to control Africa and its resources. Nice try, I doubt you actually watched that video in full. It's as if you just randomly searched \"Africa and China\" and just linked whatever videos you found. But thanks for proving my point. And let's put the actual title of the video up so people can get the proper context of the video.\n\nHow Africa is Becoming China's China\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQV_DKQkT8o\n\nWhy is China pouring money into Africa? - BBC News\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p73zwc8Wufc\n\nüá®üá≥ Does Africa benefit from its relations with China? | Inside Story\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttdacYZ3xM0\n\nThe Heat: China and the West in Africa\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W11tcKCR3Bw\n\nChina isn't doing all this out of the goodness of their heart. This is a strategy to gain influence, power and resources from Africa. And they are getting it on the cheap. Especially when it comes to cheap labor. Perhaps you should have done more research instead of parrot the same bullshit the people who are taking advantage of others are saying. So, I'll use your words back at you; \"actually start reading news and not propaganda.\"",

I took it granted as one of the culture China has since they have also same attitude towards Chinese people. \n\nBut from what I felt by living in the western society, I used to be the object to racial comments or racial behavior by some white or black people(not everyone obviously) just because I am Asian. Of course many people were kind and from this reason, I still have good memories back in the time I was there, even though i faced racial discrimination oftentimes. But I would like to say racial discrimination still exists in western society and it's another level from just being rude or unkind.",

Whiter skin tone has been one of the beauty standards since thousands years ago. The editor of that video intentionally put it in a video about \"white people\" to mislead westerners who do not know much about history. \n2. also in the link, the translations were wrong, which many comments have pointed them out, if you bother to read them at all.\n3. According to stats, most East Asian females in US marry East Asian males. The older generation (NOT ALL, and I don't like those racist older generation) tends to pressure their daughters to date East Asians only. I personally know many examples. \n4. Most Chinese companies are merit-based, that's how they grow so fast. Race is irrelevant, unless they want to show people that they are tolerant, so they might hire a white or black guy to show the diversity. Guangzhou is different because there are way too many black people, so diversity quota won't consider them. \n5. Don't reflect your own inferiority complex onto other people.",

There are too few Chinese women in the country side, because many of they were aborted by their parents during 1 child policy and those who were born tend to leave home and go to the cities, and they are often very expensive to marry, so the men have no choice but buy women from poor SEA countries. Those girls from Thailand/Indonesia/Vietnam are sold by their parents and traffickers and are basically slaves to the buyers. I studied human trafficking intensely, and I hope you are aware how ugly the human trafficking industry of SEA is, rather than thinking it's something normal. Those poor SEA girls need help.

They are an existential threat against dark people worldwide. Not to mention self loathing and misandrists that promote feminism by bashing their own men. Lets speak truth an Asian woman is so insecure and feels so worthless she will poke holes in condoms to have a white baby. Dont buy their confucian pacificistic ways they are quietly fueling white supremacy quietly in America and all over the world the saddest part is that their hearts are pure, kind and clean. They actually deep down in their being believe they are worthless mongoloids who can only take over the world with white innovation and creativity but the fact is whites by in large institutionally have been good at only one thing which is stealing pillaging and appropriating and relabeling other peoples work such as africans indigenous peoples etc i say institutionally not individual white people! Anyway stay far away from the vermin and cancer known as asian females their poisoned conditioned minds cannot change and will require generations at least 2 before they become acceptable to dark folks!",

My point was those racist crybabies are eager to blame the evil white bogeyman for ripping down Chinese name tags, when it was most definitely not white people. It was 100% an Asian of non-Chinese ethnicity, probably with a gripe against China. Vietnamese, Korean, Tibetan, Uighur, Japanese, Filipino (most likely due to China encroaching on the South China Sea). Whites could not even recognize a Chinese name amidst other Asian names. Only Asians know and care about the difference. \n\nThe fact that so many Chinese are eager to blame the racism of evil whitey is itself racist.",

Before u come back with replies with \"security level\" of a hotel .... I know hotels that have the same level of security and even some of the hotel of the same chain can accept foreigners in some and some cant .... And I dont remember being refused at any hotel in other countries budget or expensive.... so u mean other countries public regulation is dumb! lolz",

To answer that question why same Chain hotels have different policy on accepting foreigner guests, here are the possibilities:1. The hotel doesn't want to go through the regulation registration works with local police and foreigner affair department. 2. Local security department has special arrangements for them. 3. At the moment for some reason they don't want to work with foreigners. This happens all over the world. Maybe they had bad experiences with foreigners due to difficulties of communication or customs or whatever.  None of these related with racism. The sarcastic thing is, in China most people are complaining about Chinese are too nice to foreigners, and the visa policy is too easy so the amount of disrespectful behaviors and comments, even criminal activities from foreigners are continually increasing. In the future, I hope we will have more strict regulations like the Japanese do.",

Guess what nothing has changed .... only the process got lengthier and complicated. I am not complaining against the rules. As an expat I am happy to abide by them as a part of responsibility.... \nChina is very friendly to foreigners.... kind of right .... they are friendly to fairer skin and unfriendly and to darker skin and THAT is racist. Many fairer skin westerners school dropouts who have got teaching jobs in schools all over china, while darker skin foreigners native speakers have been rejected from numerous schools even with a legit teaching degree... And there are number of day to day incidents that are just a google search away  https://www.internations.org/china-expats/guide/29460-safety-security/discrimination-and-racism-in-china-17752\nFinally about hotels.... hotel businesses is an extremely professional business.  no place for personal feelings. Hotels and airlines are trained to have these kind of situations and customers, this is a regular part of their business. And even chinese hotels see a lot of rude chinese customers who they really regret to have....\nguess what many chinese only hotels are regularly raided by civil dressed authorities to check on illegal activities including drugs usage and prostitution.... much less than in hotels that foreigners can stay . Finally check online how rude chinese tourists behave in foreign countries.... throwing noodles on air hostesses face .... pooping in the aircraft.... peeing in elevator ... gorging and wasting food in hotels.... the airlines or hotels did they stop giving chinese people service despite their bad experiences and unwillingness ??? they still continue right?? There is no personal feelings in professional businesses as u stated \"they had bad experience with foreigners\" LOLZ I wish someday the foreign airlines/hotels do the same. \nAnd what is a 2003 rule hanging in without any updates? if its not available its not there ... In most cases your imaginations are not facts and logic\n\nSince all your comments are based on people gossips rather than actual facts. this is going to be my last reply ... there is no point expecting healthy arguments with a person who jumps around claiming to be correct without any logic whatsoever.   Cant wake someone who pretends to sleep",

All I'm talking about just facts, no matter how many references you are citing if it's not relevant it didn't makes you right. 1. What does Number of the experts in the country to do with the increasing numbers of problems that's experts caused? The only relevant data is the increasing number of the population of the experts. https://sampi.co/china-expat-population-statistics/ 2. Visa. How many foreigners arrived with tourist visa and get student visa and stays in China for a loooooong period of time making money in all kinds of jobs especially English schools even if they aren't native speakers? How easy for them to go to the best universities it is ridiculous. They can do whatever they want without the resident permit and switch visa types inside the county. As I know not so many courtiers allow that in the world.  3.Hotel. Not gonna say much because what you saying is what hotels should be and in reality in most countries that is not what hotels are really like all over the would. 4. 2003 means your data is from 2003. 5. Chinese tourists? I can write an essay about this issue but Maybe just read this. https://dose.com/articles/read-this-if-you-think-chinese-tourists-are-the-worst/  6. Don't go down to the color topic. Too many  countries got too much to be discussed. China would come the last. Stop projecting. 7.I'm also tired of this argument, but I kinda have to reply you because for you it's just randomly saying whatever you want to say about others without any consequences but for me it's my duty of citizen to speak up for my nation. I'm a Chinese citizen I studied and lived  in counties in Asia, America and Europe and Africa, worked in tourism industry and married a foreigner who lived in China for yrs. I'm wondering how long have you been to China and how much do you know about China and other countries to say China is the most racist country? I guess not much because you dislike China so much you won't try to understand more about the it.",

        "commentText": "I have been in China for nearly a decade and I have been studied/worked all over the world including other asian countries, european countries and the US.... and me myself am with a Chinese , and I do have tons of great chinese friends and definitely one size fits all doesnt work. I do deeply love the country and continuously learning about the history and culture and have respect for that and the many chinese people who do truly follow that . So before you know me I would request STOP judging and making assumptions. But I guess you do not know (or not clear or updated with the facts) \nTalking for your own citizen and speak up for nation ??? Surely u r doing it pretty well ... nothing wrong in it . but u missed the whole point (not surprising) is about being biased/unbiased. I stand up for my own country as well but i would'nt blindly try to cover some of the real life issues it has . And THATs what you are doing .... \nI come from a heavy populated country. And my parents didnt travel so much as I do. nothing u show on the report gives a justification for pooping and peeing in the airplane or throwing hot noodles at an air hostess's face... this is just that SIMPLE: rude behavior and as far as I know the Chinese culture, politeness is said to be a virtue and a character of the wise.... Guess guys forgot their own culture. Also everyone has a first time .... When young people in our country travel usually we are taught to \"adjust\" and \"not do whatever I like\" and i have seen the similar kind of upbringing in other countries as well. Your report says Chinese people in large numbers got exposed to foreign countries recently so they dont know how to behave.... And you complain foreigners in China doing what they want??? For a record never heard an Expat peeing in the aircraft or throwing noodles at an air hostess face in china.... \nswitching visa in the country.... without leaving? where did u get this wonderful information my friend? or is it another of your walk down imagination lane ? those who come with a tourist visa/business visa/family visa and want to change their visa to a period longer than their intended stay HAS to do that EXITING the country and coming back and doing the FULL formality. Many do that by going back and forth hongkong. As per current rules a Z visa is allowed on arrival ONLY if the person has already been hired by a legal company in China and has all necessary documentation required by the Govt to give him a Z visa .... and Z visa is not a Work permit Those who do part time jobs while being on tourist and student visa are doing that ILLEGALLY those who are overstaying and living without a valid visa are ILLEGAL RESIDENTS.... \nAnd lets not dive into the Illegal immigrants in other countries.... So your country is no \"easier\" than other countries about visa. The process is much complicated than in other countries and yet has way lesser benefits for a legal expat.... also a worse quality of life .... that is what the link i sent u before where China ranked 41... dont understand what u wanna prove by giving back the same link focusing only about China.... The numbers and facts DONT change.... China Ranks 41 way behind other asian countries like japan taiwan singapore and this comparison is done based on parameters of expat life - numbers dont change.\nNext the hotel issue , travelling, cycling and hiking through different countries I can confidently say NO what you are saying hotels are the same every where ... no its not .... and a clear evidence . Are the rude chinese tourist effecting the behavior of how other host countries are providing service? Did the hotel where a bunch of rude chinese tourist shouted and nearly beat up the hotel authorities stop chinese tourists or foreign tourist in the future? did the airlines ban rude tourist? did the pyramid sites blocked chinese tourists? no they didnt .... and if China hotels are so sensitive that \"as per your say\" stopped taking foreigners because of an isolated case of foreigner causing some problem \"which you have no proof of they did\" then this is the problem with chinese hotels.... that doesnt happen around the world \nFinally color issue  and other countries have bigger issue. This is again so typical \"blame it on others\" yes others may have done it in the past . But we are living in the current world not in history... just as u said its 2018. and just this year I have travelled 3 more countries including 1 in asia and still there is the color issue .... blaming others with bigger problems doesnt solve problems in your own backyard. Dont know what you are trying to say about \"non native speakers\"??? whereas my point was how chinese schools and parents have this idea that \"white foreigner\" are true native speaking westerners and are selected to teach, whereas \"African Americans\" who are true native speakers with a teaching degree, also are considered \"African\" and not native speakers and refused for the job. THAT IS RACIST .... but you try to evade that topic and try to misguide\n\nSo in the conclusion 1) you are purposively misguiding and diverting topics 2) or you are confused and dont understand what the intent of the facts and the arguments were\nAs I said in both the cases there is no point talking to a person who is pretending to sleep or purposively misguiding\n\nTo end it : I love it here , I love this country and the rich culture and true history and tradition. Love my girl and my other very close chinese friends. And no I dont hate chinese people but I hate people who initiate this kind of racist, rude and hate filled behavior and incidents Like any country China has also problems and yes these are some of the valid problems ... Redirecting them or acting blind wont change the facts....or fix them. Thats it! I am done",

Especially in China? I am a black man and I went to China and I was shocked at the level of animosity and hatred Chinese people showed me when me and my people never showed an ounce of hatred or oppression or a history of violence against the Chinese people. Asian people are peculiarly weird AF. They don't adopt \"western names\" for convenience. They adopt them for white acceptance. And part of being accepted as white is to have the same level of hatred and disdain for black people like white supremacy has . . . Don't ever compare racism towards Asians to the same level of demonic hatred towards black people. Clown",

When you fill a job application, if you're Korean you have no choice but to tick the \"Chinese\" box\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Asian\nI also disliked the Chinese government for propaganda and that they are corrupted.",

Given your obsession to spread your words all over the place, I just realized I can't give credit to whatever you say. Were you arrested by government for criticizing it on Weibo? I guess not. If you know Chinese, just look up the conversations between those economists, pop science authors, journalists, lawyers, etc., on Weibo. They are constantly debating about social issues and stupid policys passed by government in China. Whoever can read should investigate for yourself. Don't be brainwashed by some random guy. I have several friends in China just like you, till this day, they still use all the dirty words to describe CCP on We chat, and blame everything on CCP, including more than five genocides committed by the Indonesian people, which were irrelevant to CCP. But I don't blame them. They were actually persecuted by CCP generations ago, so I think it's natural for them to hold grudges. How about you? What happened to your family or you?",

If you know Chinese language and say you are the voice of \"Chinese people\" on weibo, you will be categorized with CCP by the netizens. They have a deep distrust in politics and those who claim to be the \"savior.\" CCP said they were the savior, they said they would bring democracy and equality, all kinds of lies. You are probably the same, judging by your patronizing tone. They don't need a new CCP. They have their voice, coming from each individual, which you have either ignored or pretend to be blind to. Your buzz word style comments sound like CCP-style propaganda, only with slightly different content. \n\nAs much as I dislike your propaganda style talking, I'd like to believe you are just naive and kind. If so, you probably should try a different approach. No body is going to listen to you if your sound like a douche bag. Show people respect in your wording, and come up with real solutions. The west? You do know that CIA funded the Indonesian military to massacre ethnic Chinese, right? While the Chinese were killed in mainland, they were also kill overseas, and the west was not helping. It seems there had been genocides against Chinese all over the place. By Dutch, by Japanese, by Indonesians, by their own Red government. No one is able to help you if you don't help yourself. No one is your savior. If you are sincere in helping people, you should educate people that there is no savior, don't worship any leader, stand up to violations against you, don't be pussies. The Chinese culture stress \"harmony\" too much, and they think being a pushover will solve the conflicts. It can't. That's the real problem.",

I think some might have Stockholm syndrome or just a pride issue. That's why it's really important to let everybody see that avoiding problems is not helpful. You have to understand the Eastern culture to know how much Mian Zi matters to them. Many disasters happened because they want to keep a peaceful appearance, pretending everything is fine. It's not because they don't know the facts, but they don't want to acknowledge the facts. Acknowledging the facts means action and risk, so they chicken out. To communicate with them requires great patience and knowledge in psychology. I don't think you can change much, because they would think that you are brainwashed, which often ends with pointless insult toward each other. To be honest, I think history repeats itself all the time, and there's little hope of redemption. All I can do is protect my family/friend/myself, and other people have to do the same for themselves. If they choose to not learn from the history and are unaware of the danger, they simply can't survive when a big historical event happen again.",

It promotes good work ethics and family value, but very totalitarian. You probably do not know much about Japan and Taiwan, please learn the history of their politics and economy. I don't like Confucianism, and there are plenty of other great philosophers in ancient China, but it's sad people don't pay much attention to them.\n\nWhen you refuse to really communicate with people or understand the rationale behind their behaviors, you are basically deaf to their voices. \n\nYou are contradicting yourself by saying \"China has lost its culture\" and \"Mian Zi\" as a culture element still remains. Mian Zi on the bright side is self-discipline, on dark side is refusing to acknowledge problems until it's too late. CCP has destroyed a lot of the good part of the culture, but I can see it's recovering. The TV show Bai Jia Jiang Tian has been paying attention to various Chinese philosophies, but this type of show is still not the mainstream. I hope it gets better.\n\nJust curious, are you Fa Lun Gong?",

Doesn't matter how well you speak and write Chinese (better than these students' English), how much tax you pay or how much time and money you have invested in the country, you will never legally become a part of it.\n\nBut apparently I am mistaken because \"China is not an immigration country\" is the recurring argument they use to justify their own systemic exclusion of non-Chinese. Saying \"China is not an immigration country\" is the same as saying \"We don't want non-Chinese\" but apparently it isn't racist because they are not White.\n\nHow many Chinese have immigrated to the West in the last 20 years? A couple millions probably. How many non-Chinese have been given permanent residency (not even citizenship) in China during the same time? Just about zero.\n\nWhat are they telling us about racism in America again?",

We all suffered extremely serious racist abuse behaviour and even physical violence by Chinese people in China: far more serious than anything described in this video. Serious physical assaults, threats, disapproving stares for those of us that had local girlfriends or boyfriends, refused in housing and house shares, ripped off and getting robbed were daily occurrences for us. Local people often refused to sit next to us on public transport, share elevators or gym equipment with us. Foreign females, particularly those of European descent suffered serious sexual assaults. Any students of black origin received the most appalling abuse on a daily basis. Many mainland Chinese people have an extremely and increasingly ultranationalist and abhorrent world view: this video is a serious distraction from this and does not even explore these themes.",

I have worked with them and while they are efficient, they are backstabbing lil shutheads. A group of them once spread this libelous rumor that I've stolen one of their iPhones.",

I live in Canada and I can tell you the racism I experience from new immigrant groups here like the two groups I mentioned before has been off the scale. My experience with Chinese in particular has been mixed. One interesting thing that I noticed is that the second generation Chinese here seem to be more open and much less discriminatory whereas the first generation Chinese that come here seem to be much more racist. It's just my opinion and experience.",

Some students don't seem to want to regard them which is wrong, but I haven't had good experiences with most of them. I worked at Hollister and when they come is they blank your greetings but if the boy or girl next to me is white and says hi they smile and talk. I think there cultures cool, but if you come to Europe you have to understand races or more expected and low tolerance to that behaviour. I know not all students from Asia are like that.",

People are able to live in China but not encouraged to stay, that's the government's decision, not citizen's. What's more, normally, to be a senior manager in a company is all about the managing abilities and resources one can offer, not colors of skins. There are many foreign employees working as managers, directors or VPs in joint ventures, more than local workers do, what do you say? They choose to work in some companies over the others so they get development in specific areas, that's it. China is a huge country with population over 1 billion and many different industries, foreigners are only a small part. It would be statistically weird if all foreign employees are managing class.",

In China, most of the best schools and colleges are public, owned by the government and the most of their costs are also payed by the government so that the people can send their children to get good education easily. Peking University, for example, is one of the best university in China, a student pays less than $600 annually, which is affordable for most Chinese  families. I'm just wondering how much do a Yale student pay for his or her education per year? For people living in countryside as farmers, the Chinese laws let their children enter elementary schools and middle schools for free. Over 90% citizens of China can read and have ability to write, that's a lot of people. The Chinese government may have their own problems, but for education, they're serious.

Asians in the west are different from mainland Asians. ‚ÄúWe‚Äù, meaning us Asians in the west/America can receive a lot of hate across the board from other minorities and whites indirectly. so don‚Äôt spout shit you know nothing about.

What about the 2008 Olympics in China and how your Chinese brothers did not allow Africans(as well as Mongolians) in there bars? OR, did you know that that infamous Human Rights movement of Tiananmen Square back in the late 80's originally began as Ant-African protests in Nanjing? Prior to all that there were African students studying over there and the Chinese was constantly harassing them and discriminating against them especially if they saw one of them with a Chinese girl.  There were riots among the Chinese and Africans over there(and NO we did not start it and NO there was NO looting). There was one incident were the Chinese tried to lock the Africans in their dorms and kill them by setting the dorm on fire cause a lie was spread that a Chinese woman got raped by a blackman.  All of these incidences led up to the Nanjing protests that spread to other parts  of China and then what became anti-African protests turned into Human Rights. Look it up . Also, get that book entitled: Race and Racism in China and in the Chinas. Written by a black man named Dujon Johnson. Read that book and face what I'm sure you subconsciously know about your community already. You ask, \"Are you sure it is not the other way around. LOL\"......Oh I'm sure.  Are YOU sure it's not the other way around?",

These whites keep Africans poor and make them raising more kids so you guys can dump more food, weapons there. Have france, UK or the states ever tried to help them with their industry? that's what Chinese are doing there, they are building railways , electric power plants, roads, all kinds of infrastructure there. And yes, they do take nature resources as well, but they won't forget the most important process, they pay.\nabout Tibet , things westerners would love to do is just saying \"free tibet\". but instead of trusting the media propaganda for no reason, why don't do some serious research first? Tibet belongs to China, not always, but for thousands years, the Tibetan in Western countries are later generations of land lords, when communist took China, they executed all the landlords in Mainland China, not only tibet. tibet is not only one person, it has many people from different classes, if you go talk with a Tibetan from lower classes, you'll see how much they love communist, communist sucked, but they do bring hope to the Tibetans so they can be educated and have opportunity to earn their lives, go look how desperate low class indians can be then you'll realize something.",

That being said, you're right about China not having the same standards of political correctness regarding race, but you're wrong about China never having a racist history. China also practiced Black slavery, albeit on a smaller scale, and you can find documents about Black slavery today from the time of Zheng He. China simply deported the Black slaves when they were done with them; China sent them to India usually. China also has a lengthy history of racism and slavery with other peoples in its interior. China has racism too, and China generally is more supportive of racism in private, as shown in its leaders' rhetoric against African immigrants, but I think racist countries can thrive in certain contexts.",

Uk gives aid so it can influence the government.  Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. If charities really wanted to help africa this would be there philosophy.  But aid is about control a clever way to keep africa under control and make westerns who donate feel good about themselves.  After all they are saving those poor children.  A better way would be to pay a fair price for the goods africa produces.  So now the father has enough money to feed his own kids without aid.  \n\n\nWhen western governments give aid they  never buy local products from their own country.  If they for instance bought vaccines from African manufacturers it would boost African industry.

We had slavery, Jim crow, and other messed up stuff in history but we have been correcting ourselves. Though still not perfect but we are moving along in the right direction. Tibet and Taiwan are not our problems nor how they choose to govern themselves. We should only be concern our problems at home and not worry about theirs. There is xenophobia in every country.

Those americans you speak of may have loved it, that doesnt prove anything, why you think so many chinese flee china to free nations? they wouldnt love it if they got their organs harvested like the many falun gong practitioners, nor would they love it if they were held under house arrest for speaking freely like Liu Xiaobo, and his widowed wife, suffering because there is no fair rule of law in china, a communist justice system, nor would they love it if their kids got cancer because their village was contaminated by unregulated pollution, look up social credit system for some insight into a country that worships marxism. Why do you think china denies the Tienanmen square massacre, and school system teaches them its a lie ? https://www.buzzfeed.com/gabrielsanchez/disturbing-pictures-from-the-tiananmen-square-massacre why do you think the hong kong film 10 years was banned https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/world/asia/hong-kong-china-film-award-ten-years.html?mcubz=1%EF%BB%BF",

However, I do know that a lot of the people there aren't racist. So yes, it is fair to call SOME of China racist, but you can't call all of it racist because that is not fair to some people who aren't. I am Chinese and I am not racist or prejudice against other races, and hope you aren't also. Racism is demonstrated in every country, but you can't say an entire country is racist because only some of the people there are racist.

And you have raised a good point of the burden that some white nations are carrying there. Not only to the Africans but all the indigenous first nation people as well! Just research the black histories of Australia, America etc, you'll come closer to some facts. And as I have lived in Australia for about four years, and the embedded racism here I have seen, experienced and heard of, I have really realised that the concept of 'racism' almost doesn't exist in my home country, which is exactly why I feel quite helpless sometimes living in a foreign country as such. and also the reason why I have been doing some research on this topic and lead me to this video here",

Asian countries are very homogenous, so they are surrounded by people who all speak the same language and who all ‚Äúlook the same‚Äù. No thats not a racist joke. I mean that people have generally the same skin tone (usually pale in places like China and South Korea who idolize very pale skin, and more tan in Southeast Asia who don‚Äôt seem to care about being pale as much), same dark hair, same dark eye color. And white, black, latino, russian, etc people don‚Äôt really travel to the lesser known places of Asia (the tourist spots are usually the capitals of the country and such) so in those places they are not as exposed to other types of people. Meanwhile in the US and other places of the West like Canada and the UK, it‚Äôs much more mixed. There are people of all kinds of race. So more people are exposed to different cultures. Asian countries are homogenous which makes it harder for them to experience different cultures, and that where we come in to educate them. But in places in the West like the US, it‚Äôs inexcusable that racism is still prevalent because it‚Äôs so much more mixed here and there are so many people here. You think we‚Äôd learn by now to stop being ignorant fucks and start thinking of all of us as one stupid species: humans.",

It doesn't take much to be pleasant to someone. And the fact that there is PLENTY of racism toward foreigners in Asian countries while they cry over hear when it's against them makes them a hypocrite, not naively innocent creatures who don't know better. Be the change you want to see, Asia. If you want to talk about illegal things going on in your countries by foreigners, stop violating U.S. immigration laws and doing other crimes while over here (like stealing - my bike was stolen by an Asian delivery guy and from what I heard that my dad told me when he reported it to the police, this is not unusual occurrence). The point is, if I grow up in a household of dark haired people, that doesn't give me the right to treat a blond in a bad way because I simply didn't grow up around blonds. Asians travel enough and have enough common sense to know how to behave without prejudging and yet they don't. Then they send their kids to America (after being raised by racist Asian parents) and expect to be treated in a way that they do not treat others in their country. Oh WELL...",

They‚Äôre not innocent naive creatures, and many Asian countries really need to start changing their ideals to fit into the modern world. But they really just aren‚Äôt as exposed to much racial diversity. And for something you know little about, things can get twisted. All in all, I just wanted to offer another perspective so people can maybe imagine how different the Western culture is from Asian cultures. I think what we need to keep in mind is they have a different history that affects them in different ways and affects the current generation‚Äôs opinions on the world, and the US also has a very different history that has led us to where we are now. Also, anyone can be racist so we should not accuse an ENTIRE race for being racist. To be clear, I‚Äôm in no way saying any type of racism or just any sort of discrimination (whether it be against Asians, African Americans, Latinos, blonde people, or even people with glasses) is okay. The main goal is to stop it all. To stop the hate. And to do that we need to learn to understand each other, empathize with each other, and teach each other the different cultures of the world. So when OP blamed Asians for being racist to foreigners in their country, that‚Äôs not okay. Not everyone is racist there. And when the people in the video took down those students‚Äô names, that wasn‚Äôt okay. We can‚Äôt beat racism with more racism.",

In China they don't have that, it is a heavily censored nation of lies, that is why the mainlanders are so brainwashed and can't understand the facts when you tell them. A lot of them don't know that Taiwan is a Country and that Tibet is a country that was peaceful and happy before the locusts from mainland china came in and started to destroy the language, traditions, abuse the people who knows how many they have slaughtered. Mainland china is a terrible country that constantly lies, they invaded and militarized the sea south of china, because thats what locusts do, destroy things, i lived in China i saw how they behave, how they treat other humans. The children get lied to from the day they are born and grow up the same. The government slaughtered innocent chinese with tanks when they asked them to stop lying to them in the Tienanmen square massacre. https://www.buzzfeed.com/gabrielsanchez/disturbing-pictures-from-the-tiananmen-square-massacre?utm_term=.cvn97m4y0#.ampNl8arK\nLook at how these mainlanders behave when food is around, uncivilised locusts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4LhUgynubs&t=1s and this one again they are look at them, no self awareness no manners, 5000 years of history, haha grubs,\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMVjskBB4w0\nIts because of all the lies and censorship, you cant go on youtube in china its blocked, they dont want the truth to be told in china, not good for brainwashing",

They always complain about everything very insincere, you ask a mainlander about tianinmen square massacre try say it didn't happen because they are brainwashed, to many of them flooding the planet, should stay on their side of the firewall that their government built to censor them from the truth, btw China would be peasants in the dirt if it weren't for USA I guess that's why China hates USA because USA is chinas big daddy and Chinese are never thankful as they have no manners, no honor, no tradition, no decency.",

This is not the american system so no, chinese americans dont usually have these characteristics, but many chinese migrants still think like this and export this thought to other parts of the world so you will find it in america. Not all chinese either i met chinese in China who hated their government and hated the terribel chinese system, but they are they monority as it is dangerous to go against the brainwashing in china, you can lose your life, look up social credit system for information on how china controls its people and makes them robot brains",

I'm from Hong Kong, and you can even find a sect of HK culture that is \"racist\" against mainland Chinese people, simply for not \"respecting our culture\". Simply put, Chinese people understand banter better than many modern western societies; my white friends can call me \"yellow\" or even \"dog eater\" if they don't mind me calling them \"gwei lo\" (white ghost) every now and then. In previous generations, this was observed with cultural and political overtones, but nowadays it is simply a part of the lexicon, similarly to how in smaller American towns & cities you are expected to smile at every passerby on the street. This is simply cultural divide, not widespread racism, and you would do well to not expect every country to bend to your social expectations.",

At the bottom is the largest pool of people and in the middle is tiers of people organized by their role of overseer over the people underneath them. The group defined the top of the pyramid as \"White\" and the bottom of the pyramid as \"Black\" and in between as stages of light to dark. The people in the middle are protectors of the top as they serve in roles of OVERSEERS over the lower classes. This system was known throughout Asia and Mexico as the Caste System, as was heavily religious based as the White was Pure and Closest to God and the Black was Wicked and cursed. Today it's the same system that serves as a model for all Corporations including \"States\". The thing is White wasn't referring to skin color, that only came about with the invention of Race in the 1800's.",

Repeatedly challenged by scientists, nevertheless these ideas continue to be advanced. Such discussions distract public and scholarly attention from and diminish support for the collective challenge to ensure equal opportunities for all people, regardless of ethnicity or phenotypic variation.\n\nEarlier AAA resolutions against racism (1961, 1969, 1971, 1972) have spoken to this concern. The AAA further resolves:\n\nWHEREAS all human beings are members of one species, Homo sapiens, and\n\nWHEREAS, differentiating species into biologically defined \"races\" has proven meaningless and unscientific as a way of explaining variation (whether in intelligence or other traits),\n\nTHEREFORE, the American Anthropological Association urges the academy, our political leaders and our communities to affirm, without distraction by mistaken claims of racially determined intelligence, the common stake in assuring equal opportunity, in respecting diversity and in securing a harmonious quality of life for all people.\n\nAmerican Anthropological Association\nStatement on \"Race\"\n(May 17, 1998)\n\nhttp://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm\n\nFrom its inception, this modern concept of \"race\" was modeled after an ancient theorem of the Great Chain of Being, which posited natural categories on a hierarchy established by God or nature. Thus \"race\" was a mode of classification linked specifically to peoples in the colonial situation. It subsumed a growing ideology of inequality devised to rationalize European attitudes and treatment of the conquered and enslaved peoples. Proponents of slavery in particular during the 19th century used \"race\" to justify the retention of slavery. The ideology magnified the differences among Europeans, Africans, and Indians, established a rigid hierarchy of socially exclusive categories underscored and bolstered unequal rank and status differences, and provided the rationalization that the inequality was natural or God-given. The different physical traits of African-Americans and Indians became markers or symbols of their status differences.\n\nAs they were constructing US society, leaders among European-Americans fabricated the cultural/behavioral characteristics associated with each \"race,\" linking superior traits with Europeans and negative and inferior ones to blacks and Indians. Numerous arbitrary and fictitious beliefs about the different peoples were institutionalized and deeply embedded in American thought.",

Adele has a heavy accent, Ray Winstone, David Tennant (real voice) etc. It's getting ridiculous what the put subtitles on these days. Having an accent has nothing to do with how ell you do,  or do not, speak English. It isn't like French. England, let alone the U.K, let alone the English speaking world is FULL of acents. Some heavy, some light and those are people for whom English, or American / Australian English etc. is their FIRST Laguage.
