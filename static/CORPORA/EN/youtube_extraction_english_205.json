To make such comments against a whole community or a group of people \u2013 simply because of the behaviour of a small number of individuals \u2013 is unjust and tantamount t<b> o racis</b>m.

The institution of the EU which these bigots want to preserve has a policy of Fortress Europe, with laws that deny access and 'free movement' to anyone outside of the EU. Perhaps this explains why thousands of migrants have died, and are dying, to get into Europe. So this includes all the <b> black </b>people from Africa, and asian people from around the world who do not share the same colour skin as white Europeans. Call me someone who is actually grounded in reality and knows which way is up in the world, but that sounds like the EU is a directly<b>  racist</b> institution !",

I voted <b> Brexit </b>because I didn't like to feel manipulated, and moved around, by politicians....who seemed terribly intent in scaring the public into agreeing to vote the desired way.  We, the public, should now concentrate on being much more involved in the important job of making the U.K. better and of having more control and influence over how our country is run.  I don't hate the immigrants, migrants, etc., but I really dislike being pushed around by politicians because their decisions can badly affect not only me but also other people who are vulnerable and unable to stand and fight.",

Ten's of millions of braun people  have found a better place on this earth then they could ever imagined in there own monoculture countries. And now braun people are telling us we are racists. In spite of all the tolerance towards these people and the fact that braun people are being treated like humans, and have all the human rights that they don't allow to have eachother in their home countries.  I would like a discussion about the countries braun people come from, how tolerant and multicutural  are their societies? How about India, Pakistan, Afrika wenn do those countries start treating eachother like human beings? These countries are lightyears away from modern human civilisation.",

It is unjust and opposed to British history and ancestry to do such things. However the Liberals have co-opted freedom of speech to mean something totally different to what it meant after the High Tory riots in 1710 when the Whig's unjustly imprisoned Henry Sacheverell for speaking against the English Bill of Rights. Stop trying to use the media and government as social justice to enforce your will upon everybody. Leave us alone. This comes from opposition to Liberalism both progressive and classical which has ruined peoples lives and take liberty and justice from them.

(we have the exact same thing going on here in the US as the UK has with respect to immigration).  but we still need to look at this in the same way that a cartographer looks at a map:  with a disinterested and objective frame of mind.  To explain a little more fully, after world war 1 the victors decided to punish germany.  they were to be brought low and humiliated.  or perhaps I'm wrong.  perhaps the policy to germany was simply to ignore them.  in any event, fascism grew.  so after world war 2, some genius decided we were not going to let this happen again, and so the Marshall Plan was developed.  germany was to be remade into a modern liberal democracy.  the rest you know: germany became a successful liberal democracy...precisely because the allied powers deliberately decided not to humiliate germany again.  the takeaway for me is, don't let fascism grow.  do not humiliate the historic native stock of a <b> nation.</b>  If the native stock of a<b>  nation</b> is humiliated, or rather, feels humiliated - then hit the pause button on immigration....  immediately.  on this side of the atlantic, the free trade, open borders and mass immigration love affair began about two decades ago with the signing of nafta.  and it has been open the floodgates ever since.  In 1996 about 85% of the US was white.  20 years later it is 65% white.  This is an astonishing statistic.  It i<b> s nothin</b>g more than population replacement, full stop.  by mid-century white america will be 50% of the population.  Again, this is a truly staggering thing to behold.  As an Irish American, I cannot really be against immigration.  but I can sure see how many people would be.  (as an aside, I happen to like mexican immigration. they remind me of the irish in that they are quite honest, simple and catholic).  in any event, my point still stands.  if you want to truly arrest fascism in its tracks, then you take on the frame of mind of a scientist, not a social justice advocate:  you look at how many immigrants are coming and ask yourself how much is too much before the white majority loses its shit and starts throwing bricks through windows.  Those are your options.  Lecturing an indigenous white englishman <b> on raci</b>sm because he doesn't want to see his historical home transformed by mass immigration won't work.  you have to slow the pace of immigration in order to slow the pace of fascism.  That is the only option.",

I'm glad we are doing this, as it is an object lesson for any who pass by these comments.  since yesterday, you have evaded all inquiries and all questions posed to you.  do you seriously believe you can further your objectives this way?  Simply calling people 'racist' is not an argument.  Those people in Manchester are British citizens, so they can go anywhere they like in the UK.  Nevertheless, you raise an important issue.  What if the UK does balkanize along those lines?  It isn't impossible;  there are historical precedents for that.  Are you familiar with the term, \"balkanization\"?  If not, look it up.  Croats and Serbs of the former Yugoslavia decided they could not live together.  Were they \"racists\"?  Well, in a way, yes.  But who cares?  They slaughtered each other and now live separately...in separate countries.  Just like the Northern Irish, just like the Scots, just like the Czechs and the Slovaks, and maybe one day the Catalonians.  Are they all \"racists\"?  Perhaps they are.  It does not matter.  They split up and went their separate ways.  Now, here are your options:  you can confront this brutal truth or you can run away.  Its up to you.  Just know that running away will only make it harder for you to win the argument.",
