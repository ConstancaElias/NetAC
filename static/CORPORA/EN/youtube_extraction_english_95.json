I see it as they want to feel like they're a part of something and it gives them empowerment. It makes them feel untouchable. Sadly feminism today drifted a great distance from  what it used to be. The cause has been ruined by people that are all \"me, me, me!\". \n\nJudge Judy is a person whom I highly respect and admire. She's a person  that didn't look for handouts or make excuses. She stepped up to the plate that would lead her to her aspirations and made something of herself. Many of the feminists today make too many excuses and spend too much time complaining instead of working their way up to the top.",

Feminists are just Indoctrinated lefties taught to hate the west and countries us white men made whilst calling for the mass influx of migrants from 3rd world countries where women get honour killed in the thousands every year. If all feminists acted like Ayaan Hirsi Ali who was the victim of female genital mutilation who's friend was killed by Islamic extremists and not a bunch of well off white women who screech like a mortally wounded animal upon a man looking in their general direction they'd be taken a lot more seriously. The funny thing is that Ayaan Hirsi Ali gets attacked by the same leftists that preach and virtue signal for Muslims.",

Those who are afraid to call themselves a feminist are too blinded by the silly stigma behind a label, and, instead of working to change/combat it, they let a few misguided voices ruin it for them. I used to not want to be associated with that label for the longest time, but I finally decided to not let some \"I HATE ALL MEN\" fake feminists dictate whether or not I should claim it for my own. I believe in feminism for its truest meaning and core value. And I've met tons of really amazing people along the way who see it as I do, too. It's a shame such a beautifully simple thing has become tainted in her eyes and in those of others as well.",

It used to mean what you said \"belief that men and women are equal\" but nowadays feminists want to be portrayed as innocent victims of a so called <b> patriarchy </b>while men suffer much more in the world that women. More men, die every year, more men are homeless, more are into drug addiction or<b>  mental</b> problems and you don't see men parading and embarrassing themselves with period blood on their faces. Women have more privileges than men nowadays specially in the western world. I would call myself someone who wants equality of opportunity but calling myself a feminist would be degrading my intellectualism to people who cant even think individually.",

            "commentText": "I get what she is saying but i don't agree with it completely. I am a feminist and i love supporting other women. Not unreasonably, but when i see any sort of discrimination, i like standing up for them. Saying that that means my success belongs to Feminism, is the same as attributing one's success to one's Religion, Country, <b> Race,</b> etc. If this is the reason to denounce Feminism, then one should denounce all these other things too. No<b>  race</b>, no country, no religion, etc. Only then can success be truly one's own?\n\nAnother issue i have with these sort of conversations is that there is always so much concern for what the men might feel, and how \"afraid\" they are. Why does a debate, which is about women, always turn into assuaging the fears and hesitations of men? This is where feminism comes in for me. When certain topics are discussed, it should remain about the people concerned. Not about others. This \"But-What-About-Men-And-There-Feelings\" attitude is what i dislike. First, the problem needs to be addressed and only then you go to take care of the side affects. One does not reject Chemotherapy because there will be puking and hair loss and headache and so on. One gets certain medication for the unfortunate side effects.\n\n And lastly a bit of caution being injected in the work place is hardly an evil, if the consequences of that are a reduction i<b> n sexua</b>l harassment, discrimination or even a toxic atmosphere. When as a child, i was told to be careful when out playing with my friends, i did not feel like my fun got cramped. I just knew, that if i follow certain rules, i would be saf<b> e. Nobo</b>dy stopped me from playing outside. The same applies here. Men and women can be anything they want with each other, but it does not mean that a bit of caution on both sides will ruin everyone's joy. \n\nBecause if caution were an evil, then we a<b> s a r</b>ace would not have survived.",

When a society does not do that, it will not advance and have a low standard of living.   For instance,  a <b> woman </b>in the west would not marry a relative.  To western women such behavior, is not only out of the question, but completely unthinkable.  Western women realize the risk, as well as the consequences.  There are countries where women from the day of their birth are treated as second class citizens, whereby the father or husband has the say so, of what will be done, and the<b>  woman</b> herself has to abide or else.  There are countries where intermarriage is generally practiced, with little next to no input or regard on the part of women.  The outcome of intermarraige is catastrophic.  In societies where women have rights, this is not done.",

She trained men to do her job and watched them make more then her with less experience.\nShe never brought attention to that she worked on and fed me and my 3 siblings. Men treated her like she was lesser than them yet she fed her kids. I now understand that she dealt with a tough situation and i appreciate that she never pointed fingers of blame. When honestly i believe she had the right too.\nBut she taught us to be strong and self reliant by never expecting too much from other's. She's gone 4 years this jan 17th. Her birthday is the 27th of jan. I miss having that strength around me. Yet i will forge my legacy with all the strength she left with me.. Thanks mom!!",

I understand that many people, especially women who claim to be feminists are sexist against men and give feminism a bad reputation. Just because of these sjw \"feminists\"/feminazis/female men haters, I'm not going to flip to the other side and go against my own rights(aka feminism).\n\nIf anyone actually knew the meaning of feminism and stopped acknowledging these people as feminists maybe we would have women who are actually educated about this stuff discussing being against \"feminism.\" These women are obviously not against feminism they are against men hating women and feminazis, not actual feminism.\n\nFeminism-the advocacy for women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.",

It's needed to go after people like Harvey Weinstein And Larry Nassar but it has created it's own backlash and it's own unintended consequences such making the \"boys' clubs\" into bigger Boys' clubs since employers know hiring men will mean there is likely be little to no <b> sexual </b>harassment in the work place. It may also thicken the glass ceiling for women because where men might be inclined to hire more women in leadership roles, they know that can spell trouble because all it takes is one accusation, be it true or false and a man's career is done. It's interesting how successful women are not identifying as Feminists because they know the label doesn't serve as a good label. It has<b>  nothing</b> to do with being fo<b> r gende</b>r equality but know the movement itself has evolved and become corrupted and taken over by radicals.",

For example, a group of feminists in London protested at the premiere of \"The Sufferagettes\" because their funding for Domestic Violence charities were cut, but the reason why they were cut was because the feminists that were running the charities refused to equally cater to male victims. Despite the fact that they made up 40% of victims. You can literally look this story up if you don't believe me. Modern feminists are a joke. Especially when you compare them to feminists that existed years and years ago. TRUE feminists.",

Everyone relies or looks up to someone. I'm sorry. Life has been done a thousand times. Lived a thousand times. \nWomen in power roles are either failed attempt eroded or not discussed since it doesn't chive with the core values of the community/ leaders/ representative elects. \n\nWe all look up to someone. During her time period she had the gift of knowing Eleanor Roosevelt. A well known and highly regarded feminist. She received a stunning standing ovation in a legal forum amongst other countries (stricter anti women policies) for the rights of women and children. \n\nSurely anyone would be inspired and moved by the works of Maya Angelou. \n\nIf you have no one to look up to, you have <b> nothing </b>to spark that desire. It re enforces \u2018why I can't' because people try to lay it into logic why you can't succeed to begin with.",

When she says she's not a feminist, she's talking about being a consciously involved activist like Elizabeth Stanton and Susan B. Anthony and Eleanor Roosevelt. Don't get it twisted that the work these women did and pain they suffered allowed women to be as free and independent as they are today. An opposite example is Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85, who was one of only 9 women in her Harvard Law class with 500 men .. she did fight for women's equality, graduated at the top of her class, started the first law journal in the US focused on women's rights, co-founded the women's rights division at the ACLU, and argued and won 5 Supreme Court cases against <b> gender </b>discrimination. She is a feminist and proud to call herself one. So don't go on with your little ignorant comments disrespecting real feminism. You wouldn't be here.",

That's so scary! Even looking down this video post,  you see how men are collectively disrespecting judge Judy and women. But hey, it doesn't matter because you generalize that all men are nice and treat women equally. Why you ignore it so much? You're scared that you may be wrong. That maybe feminism is not cancerous, but mysogynists and their discourse are winning. And women are losing.",

The feminist movement, and the women who have called themselves feminist have helped all these women become the icons they are. It is simply about equality and respect within that equality. In all areas. It is not about negativity or lack of femininity. If you have a negative feeling about it you may have misunderstood the concept. And some people are simply threatened by their idea of a feminist. Not the true meaning or the concept of feminism. Within the framework of equality is where the Judges comments are true.",

She just said that she is really not a feminist because she doesn't attribute her actions to any kind of organised feminist thought. She did say that it is a support for her actions though. Which is a reasonable statement.  The kind of Socratic self-confidence and Kantian enlightenment she is speaking of when she talks about individualism a lot of you are negating and simply deciding she is right because her views are consistent with your world views and because of the appeal the authority and popularity her profession holds. She thinks for herself because she is an individual. Ask her if males and females are of equivalent value and consideration though, and that would yield a very different response. She doesn't identify as someone who advocates for feminism. But to assume that she rejects males and females being of equivalent value and consideration as false because of that, is false.",

There's just way too many incorrect definitions that people pass around. Feminism doesn't mean women are better than men or  women need to be benefited more or women blaming men for our \"issues\"?? Or some<b>  nazi</b> group?? Feminism is essentially saying each and every individual yes, MEN and women regardless o<b> f gende</b>r<b> ,  sexu</b>al orientati<b> on, r</b>ace ect. Deserve to have equal opportunities, rights just as the next person.  What aren't y'all grasping?? lol",

That part really upsets me as she is <b> old </b>enough to know that you don`t bully anyone or tare them down like she does, why people have so much respect for her is beyond me.

You are exactly what is the cause of today's so called \"feminism\" (sexist, <b> nazi </b>word used to treat men inferiorly). \nEveryone has the right to compliment anyone. It's up to you on how you will take that complement and whether you will feel comfortable or uncomfortable by it.\nJust because you \"might\" feel \"uncomfortable\" doesn't mean that that now everyone should change themselves because of your way of life and thinking. You are actively expecting people to treat you like a special person because you think and perceive things differently.\nAs a feminist, you should have known by now that women make twice as much of those comments about men than men themselves.\nEverybody comments each other, regardless of<b>  gender</b>. It's in our nature. The only problem here is that you are intellectually incapable of understanding this.\nYou are not special. Your views and opinions are not special. Their worth is the same of any other person's opinions and thoughts.\nOh, and one more thing. The great majority of people in this world are treating each other and giving complements about each other normally. Without any provocative<b> , Naz</b>i attempts of womansplaining. \nHow does it feel to know that the GREAT majority of women don't agree with you and your ignora<b> nt Femina</b>zi points of view? Yeah. Must feel bitter. \nThe best part of your whole argumentative failure is when you evidently stated that : \"Women don't make comments like nice biceps\". Probably one of the funniest, but at the same time one of the biggest proofs of your whole gibberish comments that you are a sexist. A privileged one. \nP.S This is just the clear evidence of how far the Feminazis have come by now. Making victims out of themselves because they are so weak and fragile to accept their sad little lives. Pathetic. Now go back to the unicorn world, there's a rainbow waiting for you to eat it.",

The #metoo movement is good but must be careful not to demonize men for acting reasonably natural.\nI dont condone inappropriate comments/actions obviously but we need to understand our basic natures. Nature has made it so that men compete for women and must win their approval in order to be accepted as a mate. Compliments are a form of trying to gain approval and since completion is fierce (only 40% of men have kids while 80% of women have kids consistently throughout all of history ) they take any chance they can get. I find it funny that women in the west still dont understand that they would have 200% control of everything if they changed how they chose their mates. <b> Skinny </b>jeans exist because men think it will make them more attractive to women, they crush their balls just for the small chance of finding a mate. If you can get guys to do that you can get them to do just about anything.\n\nUnfortunately nature has made it so that the bad boys are attractive(there are biological reasons) and that makes other men follow their lead with more bad behavior. The women fall for the badboys and that only creates more badboys.   In Asia the styles have become ultra<b>  effeminate</b> because women decided to select mates based on that<b>   effeminat</b>e style and the men followed suite. Dont misunderstand there is no blame here on women I am just saying that we can only reach our full potential as human beings when we understand and accept our natures. Minimize the weakness propagate the strengths and both men and women will prosper equally.",

It's funny how they want to state these things as facts when so many other women might disagree with them.",

I have always believed that feminism is only the belief that women should be treated equally as their male counterparts. That they should be seen as adults and not seen as property or at the same bar as children. As adults, women need to be held responsible as any other man who does an act. But listen to her ladies because if you believe in equality than stand for it.",

Judge Judy tells it like it is I've seen so many cases with her talking down to and setting straight arrogant female litigants who think just because they are mothers that they inherently have more rights or privileges than fathers. Judge Judy will yell at and criticize a female litigant just as much as she would do to any male litigant, and this is why she is my favorite judge. \n\nIn Judge Judy's own words: \"I'm not a female judge. I am a judge who happens to be female.\"\n\nJudge Marilyn Millian from the People's Court I really like as well, but unlike Judge Judy Judge Millian occasionally shows blatant favoritism towards female litigants and is certainly more likely to come down hard and criticize a Male litigant, yet in the same context or same situation she shows more pity for a female and will not criticize them. This kind blatant double-standard is something I've always loathed in people, but in particular women who, in one situation, will claim unmitigated superiority over Men and boast how anything men can do women can do better...yet chose to act like delicate, weak little flowers and demand more assistance or consideration from men when it is beneficial.",

Obviously, everyone in a civil society will use the tools and resources at hand to accomplish their goals, but the university didn't earn her degree for her, she earned it.  Millions of people didn't watch her show for the guy behind the camera or the guys who built the set, people tuned in for her.   The funny thing is, the majority of the resources she used to get where she was were created by men, not women, so where are the feminists whining about Judge Judy not recognizing their contribution to her success? \n\nPs, it doesn't take a village, it takes a family.",

Thank you for acknowledging that men control most resources, that's very feminist of you (or just factual), it helps that Judy comes from a well-off family, but like Hillary she is an exception to the rules, not the norm.

Women have all the same opportunities as men, and they absolutely RULE the dating scene. Most of our consumerism is marketed entirely around women. The legal system bends over backwards in favor of women. If a <b> woman </b>commits the same crime as a man, the man will go to jail for significantly longer than her. However, even with all the equality and privilege of being a<b>  woman</b> in America....women still CHOOSE to not be equal. They choose lower paying jobs, in favor of being a happy little housewife/stay-at-home mom. And that's where the whol<b> e gende</b>r pay gap myth comes from. And, of course, the media will make sure to never talk about any of this.",

I obviously believe in individualism\u2014no doubt that anyone has the ability to be the best at whatever they want to be; however, I think the idea of feminism is less about giving anyone that ability and more about given that person ACCESS to exercise that ability. The reality of modern America is that we still need to work on that.",

Not too many married Women complain about needing more Feminism.\n\nP.P.S. But Judge Judy herself has the right idea, it's basically about being an individual, an that mindset is what is going to get a<b>  Woman</b> through her life (as relying on others can only get you so far).",

            "commentText": "Men are NOT scared of the #metoo movement. It gives them an excellent excuse to discard women in workplace, not hiring women as businessmen, leave a female accident victims to die on road and so on. All these men can do silently. I will add a few more things. A housewife having trouble with plumbing or electricals at home will not get a repairman till a male member of the household is present. An <b> elderly </b<b> >woman</b> will not be offered a seat in a bus or tube. Mind you, these women are in no way linked to the #metoo movement. Yet they are indirect victims of the movement. Toxic feminism damages women more than it harms men. Men do not need women in any way other than procreation and entertainment, really. Men are inventors. They will find a way around these needs pretty soon. What will happen to women then? They will become garbage, that's what will happen. So, who loses?",

Most of them were handed to her by the circumstances she was born into. I could go on endlessly debunking the whole \"pull yourself up by the bootstraps\" logic that people born into privilege use to act like they've earned everything they have, but I frankly don't have the time or willingness to do so.",

Plenty of great men out there that are doing amazing jobs of raising the kids while the mother brings home the bacon.

She's not sitting here because of her individuality but because of all the feminists who made it possible by their civil rights and social justice endeavors. I still respect her, but what a disappointment.",

Work and someone's professional competence should be at the center of attention here, and triggering people's<b>  sexual</b> instincts with your appearance distracts from that. I think this accentuating of the female body and sexuality (with makeup, clothes, high-heeled shoes, jewelry) stems from a time when women could not get ahead in society by getting a good education and a good job (because they were considered too stupid to become, say, judges). All they could do was use their bodies to attract a wealthy husband. Then, as a result of feminist battles, things started to change (although Judge Judy is convinced she did it all on her own). So now, in the workplace, women who want to be valued for their professional capabilities should stop acting like they are desperate to catch a man. And I don't agree with Peterson when he says that men's suits are purely functional and there i<b> s nothin</b<b> >g sexu</b>al about them (they <b> are sex</b>ual!), but women generally take their appearance so much further.",

You rather have a clear set of rules that govern a crime for everyone or you don't have any. You can't cherrypick based on the subjective view of whether a flirtation was well received or warranted. Explain to me how that would be applied in a court room. Whistling isn't aggressive, pressuring or intimidating to most people. If you can't even clearly lay out what <b> sexual </b>harassment constitutes in a way that doesn't contradict yourself, how it is immoral in a way that that be differentiated from flirtation, and how tackling it has any real impact then you're in no position to make a case.

Also, according to the World Health Organization's report on global and regional estimates of violence against women, (more specifically non-partner <b> sexual </b>violence) the highest prevalence was reported in sub-Saharan Africa. The report states that when it comes to intimate partner violence, \"the highest prevalence is found in sub-Saharan Africa with the prevalence of 65.6% of partnered women have experienced intimate partner violence (now THAT'S what I would call widespread). The lowest prevalence is in east Asia with 16.3% of ever-partnered women reporting violence\u2026 The only other regions below the global average are higher income western Europe (19.3%), North America (21.3%), Central Asia (22.9%) and southern Latin America (23.7%).\" Women in developing countries need feminism.

                    "commentText": "@fix Oh very well. As you know, alimony is when the higher-earning spouse gives financial support to the lower-earning one, which is disproportionately women. However, more women are paying alimony now than before because they're making more money (thanks modern feminism). Most parents agree between themselves that custody will go to the mother, but fathers who actively seek custody obtain either primary or joint physical custody over 70% of the time. \n\n\nOne of the reasons for income inequality is that women hold jobs while disproportionately doing housework and childcare duties. Because of this double burden, they earn money on top of having to do most unpaid domestic work. The STEM field is particularly hostile towards women, you can find a lot of research on that, it's not a good example, and no the highest paying jobs are not the most dangerous ones. Women should demand equal pay, or at least the social institutions that would allow for this, because they should not have to do more work than men only to be paid less. That's not entitlement, that's just fair. \n\n\nIf you can't tell the difference between <b> sexual </b>harassment and flirting, you are not safe for women to be around. 1 in 3 women report to have been sexually harassed at work, and 65% have reported being harassed on the street. When you are a<b>  woman</b> who is constantly treated this way, yes it has an effect on you<b> r menta</b>l health. What law are you talking about? A law that forbids flirting? Lol that's a no.\n\n\nFeminists are fighting a meaningful fight now, all you've shows is your ignorance and lack of concern for problems women are facing. No, women cannot cat-call, touch, or flirt with any guys they want, and if<b>  a wom</b>an thinks she can she should be treated the same way a man is. Some people might think this isn't as serious because it's mostly men who sexually harass women. You'll have to give more examples, but you haven't shown <b> how d</b>umb modern feminists are (and btw, I am a modern feminist), you've only shown<b>  how </b>dumb you are.",

And they even had the support of media and feminists group. Want me to give an example?\n\nIncome = Sure women does household chores much more than men. But that is a problem between u and ur husband. It has <b> nothing </b>today with ur boss being oppressive towards u. Ur boss does not care about personal problems. They just want deadlines. So stop pushing companies to pay u higher when u work less hours than men. Negotiate with ur husband, hire a nanny, whatever. Find a solution to get ahead in ur career. Dont forced ur boss to pay u as much as other people when u work less hours. Your boss doesnt care about who do the most chores or who takes care of ur babies more. Lol. Get real. And btw, a lot of moms want to work less hours anyway. That is why a lot more women take part time jobs compared to men. Because they want to spend timw with their kids much more than dads want to. There is a bond between mom and kids that are in most cases much stronger than dad with kids. Which is<b>  nothing</b> wrong with that but again dont blame ur boss. \n\nSTEM = Women are not being discriminated in STEM fields. They themselves choose not to go into STEM fields in general. In college the rate of application of STEM field is overwhelmingly bigger among the male students as opposed to females and women tends to choose something to do with business, social science, nursing, etc. Which of course pays significantly less. I dont see there i<b> s nothin</b>g wrong with that. If women choose to do something which is less lucrative but they have a passion over it. Why should it be a problem?\n\n [LINK] \n\nFlirting/Harassmrnt = In case you dont know. Feminists are pushing for the definition of harassment to include flirting. Its been debated for quite a while in London. So im not making this up. Its the feminists who insists that flirting = harassment. \n\nModern feminists had do<b> ne nothi</b>ng but playing the victim mentality. Lol. They want ENTITLEMENT.",

Everything that she said in this video is completely out of sync with what the Liberal Feminist's consider. You either have no recent and relevant opinion of Judge Judith Sheidlin or you are just a wacko that doesn't care for relevancy or facts.\n\nIf Megyn Kelly were the \"conservative dolt\" that you claim, then why was she such a Liberal narrative shill immediately before, during, and after the 2016 Presidential Election when she couldn't even moderate the second Presidential debate impartially? She was undoubtedly more critical and less sympathetic towards candidate Donald Trump.",

You're talking about institutionalized discrimination of which there is absolutely no evidence that it even exists. In fact there is solid data that it doesn't. Not saying that discrimination doesn't happen, but widescale discrimination is always an economic cost to the discriminator not necessarily the discriminated, it is therefore not tenable. \n\nFeminism is a real world manifestation of how women compete. Men compete on the basis of agressiveness and assertiveness. They duke it out and then it's over. Women generally lack those qualities so they resort to other tactics, commonly \"innuedo, gossip and reputation destruction\" (quoting). Historically women competed with other women, men were favored as resources. Now women have brought these qualities into the competitive world of men and seeking to change the way the game is played in their favor. It's a self-serving, manipaulative, toxic and utimately destructive form of behavior. This is why feminism is so aptly equated to cancer.\n\nModern feminism is<b>  nothing</b> like the civil rights movement. Western women are the most privileged human beings that ever walked the earth, accounting for over 80% of all domestic spending in the economy, in addition to the fact that most male spending is on women. More privileged people have never existed.",

The pay disparity still supports the white male and it's not because they're the most educated. It's because the system gave you at least a 400 year headstart in this country and just started trying to figure it out for the rest of us maybe 65-70 years ago in the USA.  How is that hard to understand?! Now, someone who is white still may not have it easy all of those years but the advantage had always been in your favorite if you could use those opportunities to propel yourself into the next class status. They literally had to ban Chinese migrants into coming into the US back in the late 1886 because those who ran the country wanted those employment opportunities for the Americans already here. Slavery ended in 1864 I believe and those opportunities were handed out to white migrants of this country.",

You either forget or you never learned what life used to be like for women in America. It used to be women weren't allowed to vote. They were discouraged from getting a real education and from working at all. And when they did work, they could usually only find jobs as teachers, nurses, and secretaries (though there was a time that teaching was mostly a male profession anyway). And if a <b> woman </b>was married, companies often wouldn't hire her because they thought she'd get pregnant and they'd have to find a replacement. And if women got pregnant, their bosses would often fire them just for that. There was no maternity leave. Women weren't allowed to apply for loans or buy real estate without their husband's or father's signature and permission.\nBut during many of the wars we've had, women had to enter the workforce to replace the men who had been drafted to fight. But when the wars were over, they were often fired and replaced by the returning men, even though many of those women lost their fathers and husbands in the war, so they HAD to go to work to support themselves or their now fatherless children, but many couldn't find work because most employers preferred men. Or if they found work, it paid much less to women than it did for men, so they did not make enough to support their kids.\nThat's all feminism is about, it's about fairness. And it goes both ways. It used to be that men weren't considered for nursing positions, or child care, or even teaching, cooking, or baking because employers just assumed men weren't good at those things. But men who have a talent for those things should not be denied the chance to do them just because they are men.",

The truth is you were either Royalty, Clergy or powerless peasant, man OR <b> woman.</b> The fight was led by men for hundreds of years to chip away at the power of the church and state. Do you think they gave up this power voluntarily? A lot of people died (mostly men) fighting for the right to be free of servitude and to get the vote - look at the USA's own revolutionary war to break away from the British state, there's a high male body count. Up until 1884 only landowners could vote in Britain (about 30% of the men). In 1918 finally all men could vote and women over 30. Then in 1928 Britain made voting rights equal. The general male population has only about 30 years advantage over the average<b>  woman</b> with a very high body count to achieve it. The \"struggle\" for equality is really a class struggle, not <b> a gende</b>r struggle. Only the very rich elite (mostly men) had money, education and power for the last 1000 years, the 99% of Men AND Women had servitude.",

What I mean, is that men will always step up n DIE in high numbers to PROTECT their women n children as a whole ( if to many women die,  the civilization will die out, hence why women shouldn't be in combat and one man, can get thousands of women prego, hence why many men can die).  Now,  if I as a man, know that I will be risking MY life, when necessary, to protect my family, village, country,  I think I should have MORE authority to rule my household, village or country, n make decisions based off of that. Yes there are women in today's military,  but let's be real, most of them will flee when bullets start flying. It's going to be up to the men to protect, and some will die, to hold it down. Are you now understanding why men should have more authority? I know for a FACT women will NOT stand up as a WHOLE,  and protect their men and children (more then likely only protect children,  but that leaves the men out). They are NOT going to give up their lives to protect as a whole. NOT gonna happen.  This does not mean I'm a power seeking mysoginist, it means I'm a smart man who understands my own self worth, and what MY life brings to the table.",

The key thing everyone seems to be missing out is the fact that most households in the past lived in poverty and terrible conditions, many of the jobs were physical labour, and there was no contraception so women had less career opportunity anyway. The family unit may not have been equal in power between men and women but it was what worked to cope best in those conditions. Male traits are just biologically advantageous in getting ahead so there will always be <b> gender </b>inequality  based around a fair system",

Otherwise, you would have to use arguments against my points and you can't do that because you know I'm right. \n\n\"there was no contraception so women had less career opportunity anyway\". Why? Because of men. I can use examples of all the arguments used here to say men are \"naturally\" the dominant <b> gender </b>to prove that men intentionally hold women back but say it's just \"nature\". \n\nActually, someone said here in the comments that men go to combat because if a huge number of men die it's ok, but if too many women die,  the civilization will die out. Yes, exactly. Men are disposable, women are not. But somehow men think that makes them superior. #MaleLogic\n\nSomeone also said that men \"protect\" women. lol \nMen are the biggest threat to women.

Although I am former military, I think the numbers in our voluntary military prove your point that definitely more men are willing to die to protect others than women are. This should not be offensive as man's strength should be applauded just like woman's ability to nurture. This is the best & most funny explanation I heard for there being a justified pay gap which kind of goes along with what you said-https://youtu.be/6HVvagEMLEU",

NO, women do have a measure of power over men and always have. It comes down to the <b> old </b>saying about how \"A man is the head but the<b>  woman</b> is the neck, and she can turn the head any way she wants\". What women lack in the ability to dominate or otherwise physically stand their ground, they more than make up for it in their ability to influence and persuade, for good or ill. Women's ability to influence and persuade others has made them very able politicians and power brokers in their own right over the the centuries and millennia, if pursuit of political power and independence was the path any of them chose (or if, through circumstance, the path was chosen for them). Women do have resourcefulness, inner strength and an inner greatness that are very admirable and should, rightfully, be revered. Really, a man cannot dominate or otherwise lead <b> a woma</b>n without her agreeing to it: It's just like in Eleanor Roosevelt's immortal words \"No one can make you feel inferior without your consent\". Eve<b> ry wom</b>an has power, she just has to \"nut-up\" and use it!",

You do know that in a lot of industries women still get pay less then men for the same job. That here we are still fighting for our reproductive rights and what we can and and can't do with our own bodies. That we are still being sexually harassed and when we speak up against that we are shamed and told that it's not that bad. Yes In this country women have come a long way but it's a fight that we have to continued to fight or we will lose everything we've accomplished.",

And regardless of how pristine you think feminism is as a concept, or ideology or mechanism, your assertion is myopic at best. \n\nObviously racial purity incited a slew of atrocities, the point is to reduce the KKK to simply a group advocating for racial purity is absurd and nonsensical. As is your humdrum simplistic reduction of feminism. \n\nRegardless of what you say, there is more to feminism than what you're claiming, even feminists will concur that the movement is a broad umbrella that encompasses a whole range of ideologies, some good and some highly unfavorable. Sorry, but even if definitions dont change, cultures do. And the latter  bears more significance and gravitas than the former. To state that the ideologies and goals of feminism hasn't changed simply because the definition has never been updated is just a reflection of a feeble mind intent not on truth, but platitudes.\nBut then, I'd hardly expect no less from a virtue signalling apologist.",

Obviously there are going to be more men in them, the same way you'll find way less men in careers that typically require female characteristics like nursing or social work. It's not an accident that the most authoritative women at work are the complete opposite at home. If she had the same \"masculine\" behaviour at home, the relationship wouldn't work. All of this is science yet feminists want to call you sexist when you state it. I'm far from sexist and anyone willing to do the research can do it at any point rather than pushing the narrative that men are just sexist. Women are more than half of the population and could vote all women in most government positions if they wanted to. The reason they don't is largely because women don't run for those positions as they prefer other work. If you still think it's <b> sexism </b>then you'll have to make the same argument as to why nursing (for example) is dominated by women.",

No one truly gets to where they are without direct and indirect help---help from people you know in your circle of family/friends and even people you've never met who have built institutions and laws that have made society function better.  We also all have had help from innovation and technology that people from the past have worked hard to create so that life could be better for everyone.  So to say you got somewhere all under your own power is a bit delusional and comes from shallow thinking, I think.\n\nI wish today's feminists would realize that we can't change things by bashing men over the head to try to make them treat us better. In reality, there is only a small percent of men who are truly sexists in a way that is damaging.  Most of the damage actually is systemic---not from any one individual.   The <b> sexism </b>is directly caused from the socioeconomic system we continue to adhere to, a system that was born out of intense inequality and strife.  Things like<b>  sexism</b><b> , racis</b>m, and inequality are built into the system's mode of operation so there will always be a trend towards those things, we'll always be fighting that inclination in some way.  We need a new system altogether, one that is designed to create equality, good human health, and environmental sustainability.

Government knows that deviding a country into smaller countrys and injecting there own pupet leaders to run it is the best way to overthrow it and get it to do what they want it to do. Its not that different for familys. Where there is a unit there can be division. Feminist works for them, if men where more prone to the idea is would be called masculinest. Not only feminism, but other ideas are used to because the get people to use their emotions in stead of <b> common </b>sence.<b>  Race</b>! Thats a big one. Lets devide the nations with that by spreading lies. The book goes on and on",

The whole idea behind feminism is simply equality.  Before it was about rights, and now it seems more about what comes with those rights.  We have the right to work, but equal pay is still an issue and there is workplace <b> sexism.</b>  We have the right to go to school, but many women are discouraged from STEM careers due to harassment,<b>  gender</b> bias, or because of the sacrifices required.  When I was studying pre-med, I was given a book where the entire book described what women should consider before becoming a doctor and it basically said if you want to be pregnant before 30, don't become a doctor.  Also how our culture and the media portrays women is really important.<b>   Sexua</b>l violence against women is almost never taken as seriously as when it happens to a man - why?  There are even some states where laws make it harder to accuse a husband <b> of sexu</b>al assault.  And keep in mind, outside of western countries, many women have it far worse.  Feminism is important, and the fight for equality shouldn't stop just because some people ruin the definition for their own political gain.",

Scandinavian countries have the most egalitarian societies and the gap in tech jobs actually widens instead of shrinking. It's biological difference, men and women are interested in different things, exceptions don't make the norm, fighting for equal representation (equality of outcome) is a disastrous route.\n\n\nFeminism is cancer because they fight for more and more privileges, they achieved their goals at equal rights, that's where they should've stopped",

There have been several studies done on girls outperforming boys in math, science, and CS, but going into the fields the numbers for women drop off.  More women are entering engineering now, but the drop off rate is still alarming.  Remember, computers used to be seen as clerical work that only women did, but then PCs got marketed towards boys in the early 90s that grew into 'geek' culture.  Here's one article for reference: https://venturebeat.com/2015/01/27/study-girls-outperform-boys-in-math-and-science-all-over-the-world/",

So 15 years of encouraging women and it did <b> nothing.</b> At that point it's not discrimination, it's women's choices.

She would probobly be at home in a long dress cooking meals for her family, dreaming of being able to get an education and have a career. She would not be able to have a driving license or speak in a company of men. She would be scared to raise an issue and utter her opinion on politics or on the society. She would be obeying her husband's wishes, her father's, her brothers... Her sole purpose in life would be to be good and proper, and to raise children. She would be scared to follow her heart and be afraid of being scorned (maybe even stoned/burned/hanged) if she does. She would be scared to become an outcast, shamed, reprimanded for her opinion that she, that all women in America, should be equal to men... Ironic, isn't it? \nBefore you so proudly throw feminism in the gutter, think of all the women in this situation TODAY. Can you think of any country, any culture? Have you any ideas on how to change their situation? Would courageous women and men coming together in a movement help? In the western world that movement was named feminism (daring to use a word connected to female/woman, for the first time truly brining women to attention), but it could of course be given other names, if you would prefer that.\nAs to Judge Judy, she is great, <b> nobody </b>takes that away from her, everybody knows she is a hard worker. But her purely individualic perspective expressed in this show is saddening, that's all. Being proud of not being a feminist, just makes me truly hurt in my heart for the good and courageous men and women who got us here, and who still work on modern women issues, and for all the millions of women still struggling badly in other countries. This show's message clearly undermines the feminist movement, and that was also the intention of Megyn who was glad to interview a like-minded person. But why on earth are some people so eager to do that and are so proud to reject this truly fantastic phenomenon? Because somebody told you that somebody had said that some feminist whose name you don't know hate men, and so that's it for you? Or that somebody you percieve as smart has said that feminism portrays women as victims and you thought that sounds true, so you join to think that feminism is really bad for women? I just truly want to know. Where does it come from, how do you think about it?",

Do you think prior to feminism there weren't highly intelligent qualified women who wanted to go to law school? Or once women attained their law degree do you think those women decided that was enough, they'll settle for the degree go back home and have babies. No. Those women and women like them protested, they lobbied, they fought tooth and nail to make sure women like J. Judy could passionately achieve their dreams. That doesn't mean the work ended there. She is an older<b>  woman</b> which mean she had to continue that fight to get where she's at. If she doesn't want to label herself a feminist that's her prerogative. She doesn't have to have her name in history to have contributed or benefit from the movement. I'm sure the 4 fathers didn't see themselves as revolutionist. But we do. And in their time revolutionist were characterized similarly as feminists are characterized today. It's all about context. You're in it now so it's hard to see. But your daughters, and daughter's daughters will see today's feminism as revolutionary. That's just how goes.",

These are just a few examples of oppression of women, which feminists (men and women) have fought against. It is not a change brought by individualism, and it certainly did not just happen. We don't just get modern, better and more evolved. There are movements and collective forces that push for labour rights, human rights, equality between men and women, children's rights, and so on. The feminist movement resulted in the <b> woman </b>to have choices, to have a right to choose how she lives. She can now say to her husband to help her out with cooking, while she is taking a jog in her pants around the neighborhood. It is an example of basic human choices and freedoms. In many other countries, women still don't have these freedoms. And there are still issues to be worked on in the western society, for example<b>  sexism</b>. So I truly hope that you are a feminist, at least in that regard.",

            "commentText": "It actually were the feminists (men and women) that made university available for women in the first place, and it took a lot of sacrifices and risk taking for these people. I am amazed how many people in your country are so unaware, even these great intelligent fantastic women. It is unfortunate. Also, the concept of being a hero in this individualistic perspective is...disturbingly modern and honestly a bit worriying. No civilisation was build on that anyway. Maybe individualism is the cause to the problems your country is having?\nEdit: Thank you for the discussion. I now realize that the views on feminism is very different in America from where I live (Sweden). It seems that individualism is something that Americans are very proud of, despite that your democratic processes and social justice victories, as well as industrial development and innovations, has been realized through collective efforts (even if you readily point out single leaders). I just want to end my participation in this discussion with once again saying that feminism does absolutely not take away successes from each individual <b> woman.</b> If you think that, you probably are not very well acquainted with feminism. That is why I was disappointed with what Judge Judy and Megyn said. Lastly, there are lots of issues feminism is still battling. It is not a battle against men and there is no exclusive angry sisterhood. It is against<b>  sexism</b> and violence against women, it is for opening up male-dominating areas of work to women, equal pay for the same job done, for equal salary growth for women after maternity leave, and so much more. In Scandinavia, we work a lot on equality. For example, no government (nor EU) funded project is approved if the issue of equality has not been thoroughly discussed and applied as part of the method and goals. Much of that work's result is already being seen. If you are interested, there is a lot to read about the work that Scandinavia has done and how wonderful the effects are not only in regards to women, but also to families. I have never seen or known that feminism has done anything bad, so I will probably never understand the pride of saying \"I am not a feminist\". Best wishes to you all, in all sincerity.",

There is yet no feminism that makes this world easy for women. Feminism is a process, with a goal of women some day having the same opportunities as men, and also fostering the belief of being capable in our girls, and not the least teaching our boys to recognize equality and enforce it troughout their lives. I truly dont understand how one can not be a feminist, or why it is such a scorned word or phenomenon to so many. I am sorry but I truly dont understand how one can simply have other definitions on something that is so very well defined and even is studied at universities around the globe. There are branches of course, but I dont think they mean radical feminism in this show. But thank you for your explanation.",

It's not the actual new generations of feminist which gave you the possibility to work, vote and not just raise kids so she's not discussing a link with the ones who got these milestones actually. She's discussing if she would call herself one now.\nMany people who don't feel really close of current feminist like her would gladly congrats the former feminists who actually did bring this step for progress you discussed.\n\nTo be frank, 3 times out of 4 when I see a feminist in medias nowadays she's talking about the most absurd things  like manspreading etc... Of course you have surveys saying nearly 100% of young UK women are for <b> gender </b>equality but only 40% call themselves feminists after that. If you rarely see anything but posers among the ones claiming to be feminist you're not tented to \"join\" them.\nIt's why the feminist renew from 2013 went weaker. Same thing already happened in the 90's, feminism was extremely discussed then it became a quite divisive term and even a dirty word for some people because of its excess.\n\nWhat matters is people intentions no? Many of the ones who won't labelled themselves feminists are for<b>  gender</b> equality and it's wonderful so maybe folks should stop waiting for people to accept a label when ideas are what determine their behavior.",

                    "commentText": "natzki spionen Individualism in this sense is about taking responsibility for yourself,  and treating others as unique individuals, instead of lumping people into identity groups. Identity politics lead to unnecessary diagnoses of victimhood and oppressor dynamics over large swathes of the population, regardless of intentions or actions of the individuals involved. Tribalism is only natural to an extent, then it becomes a group psychosis. Cooperation is great if it is treated the way it should be of course, but it can only truly work if it benefits the individuals partaking in it.  Otherwise the incentive isn't there, and your responsibility is easilly passed off onto those you claim to identify with. I believe that this gives rise to the idea of social justice where you commit yourself to fostering perceived victims, and attacking perceived oppressors and never having to actually be accountable for what you say or do, because you are single thread of a long and tangled rope which you have lashed yourself to ideologically. But you know, that's just like, my opinion.",

                    "commentText": "natzki spionen To your point that Individualism is a problem. We see throughout history certain INDIVIDUALS make their mark. These individuals had a huge singular impact throughout the world or at least in their own countries: Technology; Bill Gates, Steven Jobs, Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Alexander Bell...Science; Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin, Louis Pasteur, Marie Curie, Galileo Galilei, Ernest Rutherford, Francis Crick, Max Born...Social Justice;  Mahatma Gandhi, Rosa parks, Martin Luther King, Margaret Sanger...\nI'm not sure what your specific complaint against individuals is. Some people may take personal issue with some of these examples being that they may not agree with their philosophy or their ideals; However, they did result in a very large impact on society. One could write a novel about all of the individuals throughout history that have impacted the world. It is from these individuals that we now have groups of people supporting and using their concepts, ideas, and philosophy. While it is true that many voices can be heard louder than one, it starts with one first. I personally think that group think mentality can be far more hazardous to a society then just individual thought. Group think, or general consensus in the scientific world has in the past caused the deaths of many individuals. Ignazio Semmelweis discovered germ theory in the 1840's and briefly was able to save many lives but because of group mentality he was persecuted and de- credited and ultimately ended up in a <b> mental </b>institution. We see what group think does in a large scale through fascist, communistic, and dictatorship governments. Our government was set up as a Republic for the people and by the people to protect the rights of the individuals. Not the other way around. As stated b4, we have made amendments to our Constitution and signed into law Civil Rights that act as protections under Law to American citizens. Our<b>  nation</b> was founded by individuals for individual rights and has always remained that way. Like every othe<b> r natio</b>n, we have gone through cultural changes. But for all intents and purposes your argument against individualism is an irrational one.",

                    "commentText": "Thank you for the discussion. I now realize that the views on feminism is very different in America from where I live (Sweden). It seems that individualism is something that Americans are very proud of, despite that your democratic processes and social justice victories, as well as industrial development and innovations, has been realized through collective efforts (even if you readily point out single leaders). I just want to end my participation in this discussion with once again saying that feminism does absolutely not take away successes from each individual <b> woman.</b> If you think that, you probably are not very well acquainted with feminism. That is why I was disappointed with what Judge Judy and Megyn said. Lastly, there are lots of issues feminism is still battling. It is not a battle against men and there is no exclusive angry sisterhood. It is against<b>  sexism</b> and violence against women, it is for opening up male-dominating areas of work to women, equal pay for the same job done, for equal salary growth for women after maternity leave, and so much more. In Scandinavia, we work a lot on equality. For example, no government (nor EU) funded project is approved if the issue of equality has not been thoroughly discussed and applied as part of the method and goals. Much of that work's result is already being seen. If you are interested, there is a lot to read about the work that Scandinavia has done and how wonderful the effects are not only in regards to women, but also to families. I have never seen or known that feminism has done anything bad, so I will probably never understand the pride of saying \"I am not a feminist\". Best wishes to you all, in all sincerity.",

Is it legal to discriminate in Sweden? The United States of America has many women's programs, to think otherwise is an insult or ignorance or both. I don't understand your hostility towards the individual human being. What about the concept of one <b> woman,</b> one individual? You did make your point clear that you were vehemently opposed to the idea of the individual person and assisting an individual versus group identity. In the US if a<b>  woman</b> is receiving less pay than her male counterpart doing the same job she can file a discrimination lawsuit and Win that is why companies do NOT pay less to women. Because it's illegal. Many jobs have negotiable contracts, so if you are not as good at negotiating your rate of pay/benefits or bring less value/skills/potential...then you may not expect the same pay as your fellow co-workers. We already have EQUAL PAY! It's the LAW! Do you not have equal pay laws in Sweden? The basic concepts that suffragettes and women of the past brought forward have benefited us women of today. But to say that you are still fighting for equality may be true of Sweden but not of the United States. I stated before we already have Federal and State laws and many programs that are already and have been in effect to protect Women from many forms of discrimination. Like anything else in life if you're miss treated and run into a legal issue you bring it to the justice system. It's not the definition of individual that's the problem. It's your philosophy that is the issue. In America men and women are treated equally. Period. It's the right thing to do AND it's the law, anything differently is illegal and can be persecuted in the court of law. What people do in their personal lives is their business. And not yours.",

And as to the angry women, if you think of Scandinavia for example, then all men and women must be angry over there, because most of them are feminists who work on many issues regarding equality (in fact on every government level, as well as in the business sector)... My husband is a swede, he is a feminist, his friends are feminists, my friends are feminist, and we are all average people with different political views and backgrounds. Here, people are so proud to work for equality and against <b> sexism.</b> Even my russian, soviet-raised mother has become a feminist while living here. We are all a hopeful and happy bunch. I have not, in all honesty met a person here that says \"I'm not a feminist!\". People just really care of having things such as paternity leaves (so that women can go back to work sooner if they like), or for striving to have women on management boards and in the government, of raising wages for female-dominated areas of work such as health care, for having equal pay for a<b>  woman</b> at the same position as the man, and so on.",

Most pregnant women happily continue their pregnancies when their man says \"We will make it work\", \"I am with you all the way\", \"I am by your side whatever you choose to do\".

But when the surprise happens, they are very sure they were very clear about it from the start. This actually happens in marriages, not only in boyfriend-girlfriend relationships. Where I live, people often get married and live without children for quite a long time. They travel together and do this and that, and then they, despite protection, sometimes get pregnant. Many of the quotes I used are actually from couples like that. One of them belong to myself (seven years together and we are over thirty), although luckily, it only was a pregnancy-scare. And there are also husbands pushing wives to abort a third or forth child because they are \"tired\", or were \"looking forward to buy that new car\". I know quite many of those stories, unfortunately. Women are often willing to rethink their family picture, when they realize they are pregnant. And they desperately seek support in their husbands. I know men that threatened to divorce, because \"we can barely handle our two\". What should a <b> woman </b>do? Suddenly divorce and become a single parent? I would, but not everybody would or could. I know of one man who actually bought that new car and moved to the french riviera, leaving his wife with now three children. The third, that she was brave to keep, was born with a severe handicap and she became completely alone and lost. It is the reality of our \"humanity\".",

Where I live, in Sweden, there is no such club. There is a club of sorts that is called radical feminists, but it is small and I seldom hear about it. My husband, a technician, is a proud feminist and is truly dedicated to make his area of work available and welcoming for women. He fights <b> sexism </b>and that often means taking a risk of correcting for example his boss. He is a feminist also in the way that he gladly will have an equal paternity leave (6 months), so I dont fall behind and dont loose more of my pension. He does the exact same work as me at home. I could go on and on. I just wanted to paint a different picture for you. My guy is almost an avarage guy for Sweden. A truly happy guy, I should point out in case anybody would think otherwise. And trust me I have seen and lived in a world that is the opposite of this and know the astounding difference, I am originally from Russia. The talk in this program reminds me of how women speak in Russia, and that is not a great place for women. And there are not very many happy men there either.",

If women chose to stay at home to take care of their family, let them. If women chose to be 100% feminine, let them. If women actually chose to let their husbands work, let them. Why do feminists now look down at women who chose to live not on par to the feminists's 'ideology' or 'standard.'

She can do it because our societies of men and women worked in different ways and fought so she can make that choice. And many key feminists who made that possible were men, women could not have done it without them.\nThat being said there are extremism in every mouvement\nFor the lazy people who like to put everybody in the same category (of any kind) and generalizing because it's to hard to use their brains, well I gave up on them a long time a ago, i'd rather use this energy on those who actually want each one of us to thrive.\n\u270c",

I have to admit I had never really thought about the aspect of calling yourself a feminist to honor the people who have fought for equal rights in the past.\n Although honoring the past is important, I'm not sure if the feminist movement is the best way of spreading feminist values. The point of a movement is to change minds and to better a situation, and if the name of a movement already polarises so many people, It might be more effective to create a new movement. This would prevent people discrediting a cause only for the actions of a few loudmouth extremists. It might sound stupid because its basically a rebranding but it might help. The alt-right movement for examole, is just the white supremacy movement, but with a new name. I'm sure those thought ideas wouldn't have gained as much traction if they were still called the white supremacy movement.\nI do not think that people who are ignorant and who generalize are hopeless, I think we should do the best we can to see where they are coming from and start a discussion. It is the people with whom you disagree that you have to talk to if you want a movement to progress.",
