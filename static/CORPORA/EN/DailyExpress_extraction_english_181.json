        "postText": "'The Labour leader was mocked by Tory MPs after a transcript of his speech revealed he would talk about rat hairs in paprika and maggots in orange juice should a Conservative Government come to power. The warnings follow a period of apprehension around potential food trade and deals with the US if Boris Johnson were to deliver Brexit, with chlorinated chicken as well as the privatisation of the NHS floating around Westminster.', 'Speaking today in Harlow, Essex, a notoriously hung seat that swings each election, Mr Corbyn will say: Given the chance, they\u2019ll run down our rights at work our entitlements to holidays, breaks and leave.', 'Given the chance, they\u2019ll slash food standards to US levels where acceptable levels of rat hairs in paprika and maggots in orange juice are allowed and they\u2019ll put chlorinated chicken on our supermarket shelves.', 'And given the chance, they\u2019ll water down the rules on air pollution and our environment that keep us safe.', 'They want a race to the bottom in standards and protections.', 'They want to move us towards a more deregulated American model of how to run the economy.', 'Mr Corbyn\u2019s prospective comments were immediately mocked by his Tory counterparts.', 'David Morris, Conservative MP for Lunesdale in Lancashire, said: Labour don\u2019t want to talk about Brexit which is why they\u2019re resorting to this absolute nonsense.', 'The only thing on the menu from Jeremy Corbyn is more delay and two more referendums.', 'Boris Johnson, by contrast, will get Brexit done so we can focus on investing in our NHS, tackling violent crime, and reducing the cost of living.', 'As well as talking about food standards, Mr Corbyn will draw attention to what he calls Mr Johnson\u2019s plot to unleash Thatcherism on steroids.', 'This, he says, is being done by using Brexit as a cover for pushing a personal ideological agenda of selling off the NHS and crippling workers\u2019 rights.', 'On this, Mr Corbyn will say: What Boris Johnson 's Conservatives want is to hijack Brexit to unleash Thatcherism on steroids.', 'Johnson and the Leave campaign promised to rebuild our NHS.Johnson stood in front of a bus and promised\u00a3 350 million a week for the NHS.', 'Now we find out that\u00a3 500 million a week could be taken out of the NHS and handed to big drugs companies under his plans for a sell - out trade deal with Donald Trump.', 'The i reports that the Labour leader will say the Conservatives want to take Britain out of the EU because they knew voters would never back areturn to the politics of the 1980 s.', 'He will continue: Margaret Thatcher's attack on the working people of our country left scars that have never healed and communities that have never recovered.', 'The Conservatives know they can 't win support for what they're planning to do inthe name of Thatcherism.', 'So they 're trying to do it under the banner of Brexit instead.', 'But his comparison of Mr Johnson and former Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher have already sparked fury among social media users.', 'One Twitter user wrote: That\u2019s a good thing!', 'We all know that Thatcher was one of the great Prime Ministers.', 'Another person said: We can but hope.', 'Mrs Thatcher recently topped a YouGov poll as Britain\u2019s greatest post-war Prime Minister.','The survey of 1,630 people found that 21 percent of voters put the former Tory leader first, just ahead of Sir Winston Churchill on 19 percent. Theresa May came last on zero percent.', 'Washing chicken in chlorine and other disinfectants to remove harmful bacteria was banned by the EU in 1997 over food safety concerns.', 'Renewed fears over the practice of washing chickens with chlorine were triggered when it became apparent that the UK and US might strike a food deal post-Brexit.', 'However, Woody Johnson, the US ambassador to the UK describe the fears and reports of the dangers as inflammatory and misleading.', 'The chlorination of the chicken itself hasn't sparked fears, with the EU in 2005 having said that exposure to chlorite residues arising from treated poultry carcasses would be of no safety concern .', 'What concerns food standard agencies more is the process that comes before treating the meat and how poor hygiene might be more easily allowed.'",

For a start 'chlorinated chicken' from America has been found to be 15% more germ free than anything the EU can produce and cheaper than in the protectionist world they live in. Secondly Boris never said 'we will give 350 million a week to the NHS' the bus actually said 'we give the EU 350 million a week lets fund our NHS' . A world of difference implying we can use 'some' of it for the NHS. If anyone is swayed by this ridiculous nonsense they've got problems trust me.",

So if I wash my chicken under a tap I 'm effectively  washing it in Chlorine because tap water contains a tiny amount of it as it's part of the purification of our water supplies.I did the same in the army only our water was more pure than coming from a household tap and that was chlorinated. When out fishing I get water from the lake or river and I process it by first boiling then adding Iodine, household bleach or a water purification tablet that contains a minuscule amount of chlorine....guess what I 'm not ill, I have no growths on my body or parasites within. We also go swimming in chlorinated swimming pools do we die from that or does it affect health...NO! So in effect the EU are scaremongering so that we buy their chicken and not that from the USA. ",
