        "postText": "'His then boss, Maxine de Brunner, a deputy assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan Police, challenged the squad\u2019s \u201cmacho\u201d culture. She was outraged when she saw a male officer walking through the office with only a towel around his waist.', 'Ms de Brunner, now retired, also ordered an internal inquiry when beer was found in a fridge with a price list on the front, a tribunal heard.', 'Mr Denby, 49, was later removed from his post as head of the Territorial Support Group, which was then based at Paddington Green police station, west London.', 'The officer, who won nine commendations, later sued the Met for discrimination. Ms de Brunner told a tribunal that male officers wearing only towels was \u201cnot conducive to an environment where female officers would feel comfortable\u201d.', 'But Mr Denby, who is currently on sick leave, blamed poor office design as the only way from the shower to locker room was through the office. He claimed he was unfairly punished for alleged failings while a female colleague in a similar position was not.', 'Mr Denby won his case in 2016. Scotland Yard chiefs challenged the ruling but lost an appeal last year. They have now agreed a payout to Mr Denby of about \u00a3870,000.', 'It is believed that the force is also helping him to set up a business as part of the settlement. With legal costs, the case has cost the Met more than \u00a32million, according to a source.', 'Dealing with rioters is one of the major roles of the Territorial Support Group. It also provides high-visibility patrols, deals with the aftermath of terror attacks, polices football matches and supports detectives after major incidents.', 'In 2016, the tribunal heard that male officers walking semi-naked around the office was one of Ms de Brunner\u2019s pet hates. But it concluded Mr Denby had been \u201cunlawfully punished\u201d for the towel incident she witnessed.', 'The tribunal ruled that the force\u2019s case was \u201cmarked by a lack of transparency\u201d and missing documents and adequate explanations.', 'The case was \u201cstriking for its unfairness,\u201d the tribunal said. It concluded Mr Denby\u2019s treatment was because of his gender.', 'A Scotland Yard spokesman said: yesterday: \u201cWe can confirm that we have reached a settlement in this case.', 'As there is a confidentiality clause in place, we are not in a position to discuss it further.'",
