No I only go and insult the wrongdoings of your nations such as yourselves.  Also insulting your mothers would be cheap like your European Union.  I can't blame England for wanting to leave, but honestly England herself is a bit of a boisterous fuck. Anyways hope you enjoyed my comment and be sure to write back angry comments to my message. Peace out (Gypsies are awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)",

There are a lot of good Romanies as well as the small few bad ones what about the settled people the none Romany Gypsy who are pedofiles who rape kill go round stabbing people robbing people braking into houses conning people leaving rubbish everywhere and in the past and still do it today starting wars enslaving people taking countries that's not theirs and puss in the Natives out i could go on but i bet none of you will think twice about my comment and won't take notice and still have your negative views and still keep your Racist ways and keep texting your small minded racist thoughts",

Also the horse pulling it can just take a shit on the street and gypsyes won't do anything about, they just leave it there without paying any consequences.\nThey also beg on the street, manipulating the emotions of people around them to get money (Like how 1 time i saw a gypo begging on the street with dirty, old clothes and flip flops. And then then that same day during evening i saw that same gypo with his buddies in a caf√©, he litteraly had that rapper look with leather jacket, jeans, shoes, cap and goldchains)\nAlso to expand on the thief part. There was this one incident not long ago, where, ironically, a novel writer who part of his wealth spent on charities to help gypsyes, was beaten and mugged by 2 gypo kids (Luckly he wasn't killed).\n\nThere's much more to be said but i'm just tired of typing :P",

    "commentText": "Unfortunately the sad reality is that a \"Roma country\" would never work due to their entire culture being somewhat \"parasitic\" in nature. They never actually create anything, advance anything or whatever, their culture only \"works\" (if you wanna call it that..) because most of the world aren't like them. They need others to actually create things, advance things, build things, run things etc. for them to essentially \"leech\" off of.\n\nI'm not saying this to be mean or whatever but it's just the nature of that culture, and the relatively few Roma people who actually do well are the ones who've abandoned their culture. The culture simply is not compatible with the modern world or in any country based on rule of law.\n\nThat's also why the stereotypes about them are the same everywhere they go. Usually stereotypes tend to vary and that's often how we can tell they're just stereotypes. In the USA they have the whole \"Asians can't drive.\" thing for example but that's not a thing elsewhere so it's pretty obvious there's nothing about being Asian that makes you an inherently worse driver. If it was true, you'd see the stereotype everywhere with Asians and cars, you don't.\nOn the other hand the stereotypes about the Roma/Gypsies are the exact same everywhere they go as a group, because it's all down to their very culture. It's not a matter of a small minority of them causing problems or whatever, it's the very culture. Everyone living by that culture will cause problems in the west, period.\n\nA lot of Americans seem to have a very romanticized view of the Roma/Gypsies though, I have no clue where that comes from but I've had Americans comparing the dislike of the Romas to the 1930's Germany etc. which is insanely ignorant. The Jews were hated for who they are, the Gypsies are hated for what they do. No one gives a shit if some banker, football player or whatever originally came from a Gypsy background as the problem isn't their ethnicity. If he's successful in the western world, clearly he has abandoned his culture and then he's not a problem.\nIt almost seems like some Americans think the whole romantic image of a trading nomadic people traveling around in their horse carriage is actually true. lol \nMaybe it's also due to the few Roma people going to USA being the well off ones (It's expensive..) and the ones maybe trying to get a \"fresh start\" away from their culture.. Who knows..\n\nNo matter how much people love to scream \"RACISM!\" these days, this issue has nothing to do with race. Well, not for anyone but the most extreme of far-right people at least, it's all about their culture. That's also why they're not doing great (as a group) anywhere as they simply can't fit in to any modern society based on rule of law, it's impossible unless they abandon their very culture. If a Roma/Gypsy then decides to get an education, get a job, obey the law etc. like other normal people, chances are that person will be \"shunned\" by other Romas/Gypsies. They've never been interested in integrating in any way, shape or form. You have to remember that USA was created in less time than the Romani have been a problem in Europe. It went from no USA to the USA we know today in less time than Gypsies have been in Europe, and even way back in the day their reputation was the exact same as it is today, as the culture really hasn't changed. It's just a shitty fucking culture, no matter how much you may like their colorful dresses, the romanticized \"freedom\" or whatever.",

The Sinti however do not associate themselves with the Roma and consider themselves to be a different ethnicity altogether. The Sinti of Germany, Holland, France and Spain usually intermarry. Sometimes they marry local non-gypsies but less often. When they do, then the following applies: If the father is a Gypsy, then all the children will be considered Gypsies. If only the mother is a Gypsy, then the children are not considered Gypsies anymore; thus their sons never can have a say among the men when deliberating some internal issue. In the language of the Sinti, the word \"Rom\" simply means \"Human\". The languages of the Sinti and Roma have similarities but they have trouble understanding each other. Sinti has many words in common with Greek.",

It's a whole group of people. You simply can't generalize personality and behavior like that. And even if large portions of their groups or their cultural norms reflected ideas like that, I just don't understand how you can just dislike or even hate a whole group of people for that. Everyone is an individual, regardless of their background. They're just a different type of people.\n\nAnyway, pretty much no one around here knows anything about Romani people other than the phrase and stereotype of \"gypsy\" so this was nice to learn!!",

    "commentText": "These gypsies are called Banjaras in India.\nThe Central and several state governments have lifted these tribes here by giving them special rights in education, jobs and monetary help and also settling them. The crime rate among gypsies in India is negligible.\nNo innocent child or  creatures like Gypsies in Europe would seek isolation and freedom ever in presence of genuine sympathy or compassion. The real cause of poverty, enforced state sponsored  criminality of Gypsies in Europe and their isolation into  ghettos  is due to inherent hidden gnashing hatred and degraded criminal attitude of Europeans for which they are known since centuries. European barbarism is well recorded since the days of inquisition and feudalism and colonialism of Asia and Africa with might of weapons and chains. I and I I world wars have given enough proof of your culture and fake super racism. \nChrist never stood for devils nor would he be ever closer to you. He too was a migrant like any tortured gypsy.\nAmerica is a far far greater country which  never stigmatised Gypsies  and gave them dignity and respect. Throughout ,America has treated Gypsies  as their own and today they hold enriched and high positions in society there fully integrated.\nBut you have cunningly isolated them and falsely accuse Gypsies for not getting integrated.\nIt is like running after helpless with clubs in hands and accusing them of not getting  integrated . Your schools do not admit their children, you do not help them, you do not treat them like humans. You are worst followers of Christ and you are real anti Christ.\nGet it and learn from Americans  and Asian countries how they have treated their Gypsies and changed their lives.\nWe know how you cook stories about Gypsies to defame them. We know how a fake channel like BBC made a film about Spanish Gypsies showing them in bad light with stage managed  scenes of Gypsy children being asked to enact fake acts of tampering with ATM machines and pick pocketing. \nEuropeans have criminal genes among them since several centuries due to century old wars, guillotines, brutality, raids,  beheadings, burning at stakes etc.\nThis narrative is to arouse you and be careful about future of progenies the world over.",

The thing that Europeans need to understand is that how groups of people act has nothing to do with it being \"built into their genetics\" like some of the idiots in this comment section claim. People are people, and if a group of people is more likely to commit crime than another group, it will be for a historical reason. Hell, just think about it - two thousand years ago, Rome and Greece and Egypt were the largest and most powerful western civilizations. These people considered themselves organized and advanced and ethnically superior to the barbarian northern Europeans who lived in huts and constantly raided them to steal their shit. Nowadays Italy and Greece are among the poorer European countries, and places like Germany are considered organized and advanced, and some idiots even think that they're ethnically superior to other groups of people.\n\n\nThe fact of the matter is, Gypsies have been excluded from European society for hundreds of years. Why are all these Europeans so surprised that it might be just a bit difficult for them to integrate into society now?",

The king and his whole entourage undertook a westward movement of conquest, but unfortunately it didn't go well for them. After the defeat of their patron, they were in effect stranded.  It was too difficult for them to make their way back to India, so they, although badly fragmented, opted to persevere in a westward migration; hence we see these peoples spreading across Turkey and into Europe, as well as across North Africa.  All this occurred at least one thousand years ago. Linguistically they are  without doubt from Northern India. Physically, it's also very obvious. Fascinating topic!!

The used to settle here once a year for about two weeks.\nWhen they have cars, they usually had an old Mercedes and since my grandfather, who himself is not a very rule and law loving person, works at Mercedes, we always got the parts and fixed their cars for them.\nIt was always fun doing business with them, since they aren't as stiff as the average German. They would never come back and sue you or something like that. They like a good haggling and sometimes they even paid us with a good meal. \nGood times!",

In English this description conjures up the idea od freedom etc but, in Italian it is very insulting, suggesting drifters, messy, dirty people, who cannot be trusted. It is particularly insulting if applied to describe a certain type of free and easy woman who dresses and behaves a certain way. The term gypsy is also used to describe a certain way of doing business eg travelling salespeople peddling goods door to door etc. This is derogatory, too but not as derogatory as when the term describes a certain type of character who lives a highly mobile, travelling lifestyle.",

You bastards are so fucking stereotypical, it disgusts me, the fact that you can just say \"they're the worst\". You have no right to judge each and every Romani gypsi like that. Every country and ethnicity has the stupid people who will go and send their kids to beg or do whatever is wrong, but that doesn't mean that all of that countries people are like that. Stop being so fucking pathetic and rude, think twice before you speak too quick. You are making yourself sound so stupid right now.

I don't know where the money goes tho. \nSome time ago i was witness to some sad scenes, a mom with 3 kids came a 4 or 5 yo girl and boy and a baby boy in a wheel. She put them in the bus and as the bus started going she came out with the baby and left her kids there. She just watched them go. It was traumatic. So their bad reputation? IT'S REAL.

It's all politics and fear of racism accusations. And gypsies exist in any other country. Just stop saying \"romani\". That means romanian, which are not gypsies. It's like me  writing \"english\" as  engli≈ü. And their languages by the way only they understand. Just so you can have an idea the romanians can not speak the rroma(gypsy)  languages and considering they live together in the same country should tell you a lot.

It is true that they really love to party and often play loud music in the middle of the night, which is a tiny bit annoying, but overall the romani I have had the pleasure to meet are extremely nice, kind people. Unfortunately, though, here they are being heavily discriminated against, considered second-class people by some, and hearing people say \"death to gypsies\" is far from uncommon. They are the scapegoat that politicians blame for every single one of our problems to distract us from our misery while stuffing their pockets with our money. It is usually hard for them to find a well-paid job because of discrimination, so they sometimes turn to begging and/or stealing to feed their families. Then people say that they are lazy assholes who spend their time doing nothing and rely on government aid to survive and this only makes their apartheid worse.",

In this case, they're thieves. Apparently, word has it that one of their time honored traditions is to rip every non-gypsy off they think they can get away with. They DO NOT assimilate. They marry ONLY their own in arranged marriages, as marriage to outsiders lowers them on the social scale, particularly, when the outsider is male. They DO have a central language which derived from Sanskrit (the world's OLDEST language, originating in India) three- they try & work the welfare system. Of course, people will say this should be included under number one. Also, they are pigs. In Europe, one will see their property value plummet if they move next door. The reason for this is they are the biggest hoarders on the planet. They would shit up their property in no time, negatively impacting the value of YOURS. In the UK, they can't stand them.",

Then told that we should be grateful to be crammed in ghettos at the least gentrified places possible and made desperate by lack of actual oppertunities.\n\nWonder where thier behaviours come from, hmmm? Right, as you are alluding to, it is in our DNA. Like how the Nazis felt about Jews.\n\nAs long as I live, I will be proud to be a walking contradiction to your racist views.",

Gypsys don't like politics,war they don't hate anyone or any religion, they don't get involved into anyones lives. They are happy with little that they have, they love music they love to party and drink they love to be in love! Is not important how small and ugly is their house but they do have good sound system and a satellite dish ! Music starts in the morning in their homes and doesn't stop through the day! And it must be loud! They don't care if the taxes get higher or pensions get lower, they go on with their happiness no matyer what. Sometimes i wish i could be like them.",

Here in good old germany no one cares if im a roma, i can tell the people where im from without having to fear that i will be in disadvantage. Hell if i would still live in the balkan i never would have be able to go to university. So again thank you my albanian brothers for giving me this opportunity.",

But since both are nomadic ppl, like roma actually were traditionally, all kind of ppl were called by the name \"gypsy\", simply to denote 'they're not a part of us'.\nExactly like in Balkan during Ottoman empire and many folks where forced to migrate bc Ottomans were forcing Islam on Balkanians. During that time also Roma ppl were living in Balkan. However, back then all kind of folks were called \"cigan\" (= gypsy) \"Osman\", \"Turk\". Basically anyone who converted to islam or/and invaded certain areas was called by one of these names. The word \"gypsy\" was thrown at all kind of ethnicities. Roma are an ethnicity on their own. Gypsy is a slur word.\n\nLater, during the Hippie era then a \"bohemian\" and \"gyspy\" style became a trend. The way these ppl dressed during the hippie era was and is very unrealisic compared to ethnic roma/romani pp; as they never wore feathers and all kind of these trends back then. Ppl literally mixed all kind of trends (balkan, oriental, native american, etc.) and labled it as \"bohemian, gypsy\", blah blah.\nTraditional clothing among roma/romani ppl is very diverese; as they spread all over europe and came with many european ethnicities in contact.\nRoma/Romani tribes reached Europe some ~1000 years ago. Their origin is somewhere between north / central india.\n\nThis documentary is a mess imo.",

Due to a lack of written material, their origins are quite unknown but genetics show they don't belong to the Romani group;\nand only a small part of the Jewish people came from the place we now call Israel. According to the Israeli professor of history Shlomo Sand, the great David Ben-Gurion was convinced that the Old Testament Hebrews had never moved out from Palestine and their real descendants would actually be the Palestinian still living there. Interesting theory, isn't it?\n\nApart from these two mistakes, the video is really interesting. The Romani history is undoubtedly special. In the past centuries, they sometimes have been mistaken for Jews (and vice versa) by ignorant peasants.",

    "commentText": "It's pretty funny seeing USA's minorities all racing to be the no. 1 victim of the country claiming racism and discrimination, while gypsies in the eastern europe deal with their racists by force because they can. \nUsually prisons offers better living conditions for most that belong to the tier that I like to call as \"footsoldiers\", the ones that do the action, the lowest tier they have. So even if they commit a serious crime, it's probably in their personal interest to get incarcerated anyway. I mean, in Romania there's no life sentence so why live on the streets when you can just go to prison, get to know others of your kind and learn from their mistakes, maybe get some new skills and tricks, and after getting out attempt to live the dream of owning a corrupted empire.\n\nSome of them, usually in the higher tiers, have some sort of code of honor. If you don't mess with them, they don't mess with you, especially if there's nothing to gain or prove wrong from that. It's the lower tier that likes to instigate and be chaotic. Which sometimes means the ones in the higher tier can just abandon them and let them be free to do what they want without any cover if they get themselves stuck in deep shit. But the moment they have a point and you don't, they will make sure both you and your family remembers it.\nIt's true that the ones in the higher tier may have ties with giant illegal activities, but that can apply to any race of any country. They just have it easier because they have convenient access to manpower, unlike cultured majorities who usually need political sides and fake promises to achieve that.\n\nThey are usually very united in their causes. Sure they have their own internal drama, and sometimes fights between their own gangs. But if something affects them as a race, they will band together and make sure that problem becomes a priority to deal with.\n\nNo matter what's your opinion on them, imo easter european ones are part of the toughest of the minorities. Black people in USA who complain about their country are a bunch of pansies who use the slavery of their ancestors as a sort of extra points for getting privileges, and yet the result is that the future generation of those slaves are living a better life than in their original 3rd world continent. You keep hearing about Hitler how bad he was, but in the end the jews did get what they wanted because of him: Israel. But both of them won't shut up because they want more, that's how human nature works.\n\nAll minorities face discrimination everywhere in the world, but 1st world countries deal with them by being a bunch of crybabies. 2nd world minorities man up and make their presence feared. \nYou don't mess with the gypsies of eastern europe.",

    "commentText": "Congratulations. This is a very well-written analysis. I live in a country with a vast Roma minority and a great part of my childhood I lived among them.\nAs for a possible location of a Romales country ... I think you're kidding. Even though the great powers of the world would agree to find such a place for a Roma state, this state would probably be never populated. \nAs I said, I knew them well enough to say that I understood their spirit. The spirit of free people who did not like to be tied to any particular country or place or even to follow any other rules than their own local rules or customs.\nEven as individuals or as small groups, they can adapt to a certain place and can remain in the area for the rest of their lives, or until they are completely absorbed by the population of that region, but as a nation, they are the embodiment of the idea of migrating people, dwells or migrate where they felt better. \nBecause, for thousands of years, they were never allowed to access these things, the notions of homeland, citizenship, or civic spirit is something that most of them can perceive only at the intellectual level not emotionally, being notions, emptied of any content, and that's why I always admired them. \nThey are a very resilient nation that not only did not vanish throughout history (as so many other nations did), although no one loved them, but they will probably continue to last many centuries from now on. They are like water. Very hard to contain it for eternity, the water can take so many form and aspects, being almost impossible to be destroyed.",

And I can say so that they are destroying mainly their own reputation and I think it's a pitty bc I know one gypsy he's pretty old now but very nice and I haven't seen him stealing anything from the shop or shouting out on the streets loudly. And I know also few of another gypsies who are ok. But then everyone in the town knows a few of gypsies that are notorically known for spreading stereotype about gypsies who are stealing, shouting, etc... because they really do it.",

It just depends on where they live, here in America gypsys are modernize and up to date as to gypsys in romamia who are more traditional, however one thing i can say is that all gypsys are united in the sense that we don't like outsiders, we do what we do because that's how we were raised and taught to, we value our family more then anyone else and to us its our culture agasint the world. But this won't last long, because each generation is starting to grow out of that and soon maybe 20 years from now there won't gypsys anymore well at least not in well off countries like America, \n\n(Sorry for the poor grammer.)",

Many Turks dress trendy so when a woman walks up wearing mis-match top & skirt with socks and sandals, you know she's gypsy. Then her husband comes in talking smack to her, telling her to be pushy with the gov't workers because he apparently has a deadline for something. He then tells her that if she doesn't get it done they will give him a penalty after which she will pay for it herself. I wanted to smack him. On the other side of that coin, my brother-in-law hires gypsies for parties because they are the most musically talented of anyone in Turkey. He pays them with alcohol....but with 500% tax on alcohol, that will change soon.....",

And my friend who has been hosting me later told me that once during a project in a local school he saw even the legal discrimination. What he told me was frustrating. He told me there is a limit of two gypsy students per each class and its not even filled usually because romanian families pay gypsy families to not to send their kids to school, they dont want romani children to study with their children. And even if a Romani kid goes to school, scholl gives him an identity card expressing his race (I see no difference from nazis). So they cant really get educated and after the education as well, companies or institutions just don't give them jobs. And still Romanians blame Romanis for \"ruining their reputation\".",

    "commentText": "Let me just tell you the ways they are earning their money in Romania and Hungary (they probably do it the same way in other Eastern European countries).\nThey usually send their kids to the city to beg for money. They also seek usable stuff in dust bins and they leave a huge mess around garbage containers and stuff. Another thing they love to do is to STEAL. One of their favourite materials is metal. They steal electricity wires, railway etc. Then they won't steal your wallet, phone etc. right? Hell no. They will. They will get it out of your pocket, they will steal your purse, backpack etc. They can even slit your throat if they want to. Another thing some of them do (which is probably the only thing they do that doesn't harm anybody) is that they go to the forest and collect mushrooms, flowers, raspberry, blueberry etc. and sell them. Most of them don't have a legal job. They get lot of money from the government (social help, kids money etc). And now let's talk about the ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù they do. A lot of men go to Western Europe or Hungary (from Romania), Poland etc to ‚Äúwork‚Äù. They obviously don't have a real job. They make a lot of money and come home, buy old sport cars and build ‚Äúcastles‚Äù which look horrible by the way. A lot of gipsies have vans to transport stuff. Most of them have Hungarian (especially in the region of Romania where I'm from), Polish, Bulgarian or Italian number plates.  A lot of gipsies that can't read (most of them) buy their driving licence in Bulgaria and they don't even know the laws and stuff. The average age when gipsy women give birth to their first child is like 15-16, or even 13-14. And they usually have like 5-6 children, which is very high compared to the 1 or 2 children that Hungarians or Romanians have. Obviously most of them are illiterate, dirty and stinky.\nPeople don't hate them because of their skin colour,  but because the way they behave.

If you randomly select a gypsy, the chances they are below poverty line, or don't have a highschool diploma, or can't do middle-school grade mathematics, or don't have a job, or are iliterate is MUCH MUCH higher than a randomly selected italian.\nAlso, your premise is false, no one measures economic, career, intellectual or being a law-abiding person by whether the person stays at their family home in their youth or leaves to stay in a shitty rental.\nThe gypsies are simply one of the lowest intelligence groups in the world. You think that has nothing to do with their economic, career, intellectual or unlawful outcomes?\nI mean we can talk about facts, and we can talk about how you a gypsy have certain feelings about who your people are, devoid of facts and innacurate to reality.

Not everyone's the same, stop generalising. You must really hate us for writing that long hateful comment. MOST of the gypsies I KNOW have degrees, broke out from the shitty  and oppressed lives they lived and aren't hurting anyone. None of the countries you mention do anything to integrate them into their society, all they do is pretend to help but really, no gypsy gets a job without being white passing (which  I am, due to my mother being a white  Hungarian, hence the great jobs I get - it's not fair, i know...) and even in schools they are sent to schools where teachers don't give a fuck and even the teachers themselves are racist towards little kids. These kids grow up listening to how bad their parents are, not given opportunities, bullied, then people are surprised why they quit school so soon. Once they quit school they are normally forced into situations where they have to do illegal shit to survive and feed their mum/dad. BUT you can go to Hungary, go into a gypsy household, you'll be shocked how clean they are and how welcoming they are. If a gypsy has a loaf of bread and  NOTHING else, they'll still share that with you. You gadjos would rather suck yo mamas pussies than to share the wealth and status ya'll BULLIED out of other minorities. Oh and regarding your comment about the \"good gypsies\" that are musician. The white gadjo cunts only like us when ya'll can use us for our talents because you nasty human beings are jealous. Every little gypsy girl has the moves of a pro dancer with 20 years of experience and every lil gypsy boy does too. Ya'll \"hire\" us to play music at your wedding because ya'll cant have a good time to your gadjo music and then try to pay us with A PLATE OF FOOD like the job they do isn't worth anything... So people who are reading these and might have negative experiences with the people of romani ethnicity, do not think we're all bad or that it's that simple.

They have low intelligence which causes them to not get opportunities, not they get less opportunities which causes them low intelligence. You don't get dumber because you aren't offered a job.\nBut like Farrel, you don't seem to understand, or want to, how medians work. It doesn't say anything about the individual, it says about the number of individuals. If the gypsies have an average IQ, of 74, 50% of them have IQ's under 74, 50% over, which also elucidates other things like the distribution, a group with 74 IQ will have way less people with IQ's over 130 than a group with 100 average. The fact that you have a degree and know gypsies that do means nothing to the group average, it's subjective. Infact, you would expect that if you did have higher intelligence, most other gypsies you know would too, because we live in a world of free association, and people settle in communities and social circles which represent them.\nBut i don't think we're getting anywhere, both you and Farrel are into fantasy, you see no responsibility for the gypsy when they fail, but take all the credit when they succeed. When it's a win, it's the gypsies brilliance, when it's a fail, vastly the case, everyone else's fault.\nI mean you aren't even good faith communicators, you are bad faith ones, stuffing your comments with non-sequiters like muh italians have bad economy(compared to who lol, to the gypsy community they are super rich) or subjective experiences.\nGo read up on the veil of ignorance argument, if you could choose which ethnicity to be born, and everything else random, like sex, intelligence, wealth of family etc, no one would choose to be born a gypsy, for incredibly obvious reasons, infact it would be one of the last choices you would make, probably exemplified even by you and mad Farrel, since what are you, americans/canadians that have like one half of your last 4 generations ancestors white?",

    "commentText": "hey masaman, just wanted to make a few corrections for you. first off we pronounce our broad name \"rum-knee\" and my group \"rum-nah chel\". also the irish travellers, although similar in lifestyle and we do intermix and marry here and there, are not ethnically romani in anyway (unless mixed). the traveller groups that are supposed to be part romani are English and lowland Scotch travellers although they probably existed as a group before we arrived in the British isles and mixed. also most real Romani's wouldn't want their own country (at least not us in America) because unfortunately some of the stereotypes are true for some of us. my family have been honest businessmen for generations but i do know many con men. if a con man gypsy lived in a country full of his own people who he doesn't want to con or can't con because they know the deal, how would he survive? while more and more of us (the majority at this point) work honestly and follow the teachings of Jesus pertaining to morality we have a strong distrust for police and government. it's hard to tell at this point what came first, gypsy distrust of authority or the persecution towards Romani's. \n                    i know many people on here have stories and bad experiences with Romani's and i don't doubt them. I will say that we much more honest here in America and here we are no more criminal than another ethnic group that gets painted with a broad brush, the Italians. I do hear in Europe Romani crime is much more rampant. I won't excuse their bad behavior but I do wonder if it's in part due to them being stereotyped and not given honest jobs as often. here in America most people just think (depending on the complexion of the individual) we are either Italian, Greek, or Mexican. we blend in easier here so I think we had an easier time turning from the con game. hope this was helpful, thanks for the videos bub",

It was hypothesized that the original grouping went off to war in a northern India area. During the war the central government collapsed leaving these Romani soldiers to take care of themselves. These Indian languages were then blended and these individuals struggled off to find a place to settle and live.",

A class-based religion called \"Varna Dharma\" was founded by brahmins and a warrior-class ordained as Kshtriyas began to carve out kingdoms of their own by conquering ancient democratic states and displacing entire populations from their homelands. \nThese were times of tremendous oppression and genocide. These populations sought refuge in other lands.  Any unwanted and homeless people who are driven out of their homelands will naturally become segregated and end up in poverty and criminality. Thus emerged the untouchable classes of India.\nEvidently, the Romanis or Gypsies are from these native people of the Indian subcontinent who fled their motherlands in times of great turmoils. A large segment of the Naga people of Indian subcontinent have become untouchables under this Varna religion (mistakenly referred as hinduism). \nIf you came across names like \"naga\" among the Gypsies & Romanis, you can be sure that they are of Indian origin. Recently, Gypsies in Europe rallied under the name of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, a great intellectual who drafted the Constitution of India and laid the foundation of national currency & the Reserve Bank. He himself was from an 'untouchable' class.",

The majority of them can't be educated,they bully the people that don't live like them, they love to live in poor conditions,they are lazy and don't work, they beg and steal from other people,etc. They don't have respect for others and care just about them. Don't belive me? If you gonna visit Bucharest in the future do a visit in the Ferentari neighborhood.(just wach your back to not be robbed) \nThe worst part at least here in Romania is that instead of being assimilated by the population they assimilate the normal Romanians, many Romanian families just blended together with gypsies adopting their miserable lifestyle. Sure they are gypsies that really can be good, educated and live in peace, those people deserve all the respect, but the majority is what it is:pure monsters.",

    "commentText": "I'm Romanian from Moldova though people often tell me I don't have a European face. The hate towards Romani/gypsy people stems from Antonescu style dictatorship (in Romania) mentality or soviet influences (for post USSR countries). \n\nAll of that mixed with strict gun laws in Europe (Romania has the strictest gun laws in the world) is a recipe for racism because if any person would shit in one's garden in the US, he has a good chance of getting shot and going to the hospital in the best case. That is just not something that can happen in Europe because of \"common sense gun control\" bullshit. Until Europeans learn to accept everyone regardless where they come from and learn basic self protection there will be toxic hate, snobbism and cosmopolitanism forever. Whining over Romani people is just a scapegoat just like complaining over migrants from Syria/Lybia which were colonized by major European powers. \nOf course the hate towards Romani in Romania is also mixed with conservatism around marijuana and LGBT and ultra orthodox nationalism rolling around Dughin style ideology.\nLife is suffering, pain and misery.",

If you have children at home to feed and they wont let you buy food you have no choice but to steal it.   The Roma was the 1st tribe of Judah that protected the northern boarder and was taken by the Hindus as slaves then, escaped to Europe.  There are 3 millian just in America alone. We are not the TLC people that you see on tv. Those are very different people they don't speak our language. The drom people are Rom just a different sect. In eastern Europe we speak pure Romanes not mixed. The people usually speak 4-5 languages by 10 so we can blend and say we are something other.  Do DNA testing and you will see we originally are from Israel.  President Clinton is an Irish Rom. Yul Brenner many actors and famous people.

However, the caste system was just as derogatory/discriminatory. The caste system initially was not like this, becoming so slowly over time, to what it is today. Probably due to the higher up members of the caste system preferring the status quo. Just as the British had warped views of wanting to hold power. \n\nAlso, my (albeit limited) knowledge on the Mughals, were that they were horrific to the native Hindu populations. The only difference I really see is the power/control/influence offered to the Redcoats thanks to modern technology at the time.

    "commentText": "So i did read here a few almost racist comments and i agree and disagree with most of them :). On one hand, u have ur dirty romas living in tents, or ruins almost houses, in some camps or little villages created on a land that doesnt belongs to them, the land has their owners etc. we here called them if the translation is correct, colonies or settlements (just this simple). I mean those type of romas wont even clean up their own mess, theyll rather live in filth then do something about it. This is often because their children wont attend school or if they do, they do it pretty leniently i mean, sparsely they attend classes etc. At home they do nothing and sadly its just goes in circles, what i mean is that a solution for this a way out if u will is too hard to make, cause of their willingness to change their ways. People where i live most of the time want nothing else just them to live as in 21st century one should. They either refuse f nothings to be gained doing so or wont even listen to what do u have to say. They specialize for social help from the state and live from that. Some of them steal (thats sadly true) some of them even do murder or what they like to do, steal dogs for meat and fat, cause its some kind of remedy (they believe it is, well some of them do). These people barely speak native language in that state where im from. I dont really hate them im just telling how it is. This is the first group uneducated scum u could say although its not really their fault at least not the children, their parents on the other hand. As i was mentioning its a neverending circle until they decide change is needed. Luckily there are now a few examples of this change, building their own houses, buying that land for the house to be built on etc. Working too, there are now places where they can work. Its harder for them because most of them have only basic education so, ye, they can read and write and count to some extent thats about it. So working more lucrative jobs is just out of the question for them so they are stuck with lesser paid jobs. Still as i was saying many of them embrace this opportunity and trying to turn their and theirs children lives around. Many Romas i know are hard working ppl and they have where to live, have cars have jobs and can live normally in the society. Their children are raised to do the same, uphold the laws etc. But these are just few cases and those firstly mentioned make bad reputation for those great people and its pretty sad. 3:20 (so u can better imagine) is the depiction (or can be used for it) the second group, working and living in community as equals etc. 5:27 for example is the first type of roma ppl, those that make the bad rep. for all of them all over the europe or even world. And this is what we most associate roma ppl as, not that first one, but this. THis is not true, only part of it. Whose fault is that, well i dont really know, but could be the country where they live. Dont do enough to get them from that situation they are in. A great example is that, when a house burns down for a white family (im not trying to be racist, im just trying to make an image how it is in my country) they have to fend for themselves with the help of neighbors if they have the luck to have some great ppl living in the vicinity. If not they can rely only on family. Roma familys house burns down, the first kind i mentioned, what happens is they beg the state, they beg through media coverage for help, they beg the village mayor to make something for them, soem housing solution where to live etc. They expect the country/village will take care of them. Why ? Why should they care ? I mean yes its a tragedy, their whole life is gone, their things etc. But then why should anyone other then their family or friends help them ? They demand it even as they speak of this etc. ITs pretty frustrating that my family lost our home, we had financial problems, did we write some letters to media, did we beg someone to help us. No, we stick together and made shit happen so we wont live out on the street and be homeless etc. Now we live in a rented apartment and what, we pay rent, we are happy as we are now and working and paying what needs to be payed etc. We didnt beg anyone to help us, we helped ourselves. They wont do that. Theyll wait until someone will lend a helping hand. Im not saying its true for all of those first kind romas, but sadly thats mostly the case. I dont know if the state got them so dependent or they themselves did it. Could be both and now they are trapped. But as ive mentioned its getting better. Country is helping them to help themselves so they wont beg but theyll instead get up and do things for themselves. Cause mostly its not their fault what mess they are in. Im talking about only those who want a change for the better. Those who refuse are mostly those that are depicted in some of them comments here, steal, kill (extreme cases) or just simply beg on streets etc.",

    "commentText": "Regarding the question if the Gypsies/Romani could establish a state of their own I'd say impossible. First of all the number of Gypsies/Romani in countries like Bulgaria and Turkey is much higher than recognized. One reason for this is because some Gypsies identify as Turks or Bulgarians and due to their own nation forging concerns both host countries welcome this. However, similar to the case mentioned for Romanians in the video, average Bulgarian also does not like it when a Romani claims to be an ethnic Bulgarian. In fact the situation is so complex that in Bulgaria there are ‚ÄúBulgarian Gypsies‚Äùwho speak Bulgarian only, ‚ÄúTurkish Gypsies‚Äù who speak Turkish, and other Gypsies who have their own languages. Some of these ‚ÄúBulgarian Gypsies‚Äù will admit they are Gypsies and others will claim to be ethnic Bulgarians. The same is also true for the ‚ÄúTurkish Gypsies‚Äù in Bulgaria who speak Turkish and some of them claim to be ethnic Turks while the rest will admit to being part of the ‚Äúmillet‚Äù. However the situation is different in Turkey where the Gypsies are more integrated. There are Gypsies who admit they are ‚ÄúRoman‚Äù but their numbers are dwarfed by comparison to those ‚ÄúRomans‚Äù  who claim to be ethnic Turks and the rest of the population has no issues with it.",

The French people's ignorance and inculture guide them to \"know\" only ONE people : the Arabs -simply because it's said so on TV, the largest minority in France. \n\n\nIt happened that I found myself in France in 1988, close to a small town near the Switzerland border.

The locals got mad against them and invaded the town hall with the request to chase them away. The mayor brought the armed police and \"au revoir\" Gypsies from that spot.

Lookup #Khazria on Wikipedia, this is a #Jewish European civilization that is deeply root in the #Turkic tribes in the #Ukrainians. \nIf it interests you, Jews in #Palestine converted to Christianity and later to Islam. BTW, My family were Jewish 200+ years ago. Here is a good video from #PBS Nova on this subject\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfd4kFPWjzU\nBTW, European Jews hate relating them ...to their Turkic origins for Political reasons. If it wasn't for WWII, the majority would have stayed in the Ukrainians, Poland and Latvia",

Apart from originating outside Europe,  with a  small number of exceptions, there are no comparisons that can be made with Jews in terms of culture, lifestyle, achievements and contributions to European life and civilization. The shared hatred of Jews and Gypsies is a more complex issue. There are some similarities but also many significant differences. Jews are often hated for seemingly being too successful and influential in a wide range of fields. Nothing like this is generally said of Gypsies, whose main claim to fame is gypsy music in some countries and  a great prevalence for being violent street beggars and thieves in virtually all societies in which they live,",

There is always an romanian saying something bad about gypsies, then why many of you are living and behave just like some gypsi? All you want is to make a good and false image for you, romanians. many Gypsy families have been left in the field under the open sky, what do you think it can be improved in their lives? the Romanians only begged respect outside the country, but the Gypsies are discriminated at every step, no matter how they try not to disturb anyone and lead a normal life. They are souls too, they are children, they want to eat, just like us. Next time when you are hungry maybe You ll understand better. They dont have a fridge full of food.

    "commentText": "In Turkey, the most common word for gypsy people is \"√ßingene\" pronounced like \"chingan√©\"  considered as a derogatory word. \"Roman\" is the politically correct way to say it.  They are highly discriminated and marginalized, associated with criminal activities and poverty in almost every region in Turkey, however, their culture has a great impact on Turkish culture. In almost every wedding ceremony regardless of class, you would hear a \"Roman Havasƒ±\"  song which is a specific naming for Romani music. They commonly appear as comedic reliefs in tv/media but also represented as easy-going, fun, lively and gifted people, especially in music. There are many Roman singers and musicians in Turkey and they are praised.  I hope that they will be able to represent themselves in the political arena soon to end their longtime poverty and reliance on crime.",

My family came to the USA during WWI and settled in Braddock, PA near Pittsburgh via Ellis Island. My Grandfather moved to Chicago in the late 1930's and I was born in Chicago. \n\nI never understood why many of my family members considered themselves Gypsies. They wear it like a badge of honor and that has always been unsettling to me since my mother wasn't to keen on the \"Gypsy\" connotation. We didn't hang out with them a lot since they are so darned clannish and really different from other people.  I mean really clannish, nobody gets in if you aren't family. Really weird for me.\n\nHaving done my DNA test to fond out what the hell I really am made of, I was astonished to find my blood has origins of central Asia, primarily in northern India. But also a mix of Iberian Peninsula and British Isles blood as well. So, being the mutt that I am, I understand the whole thing as well, being a Gypsy descendant and it isn't a bad thing at all. \n\nNow I know why I am attracted to Gypsy girls. ;-) They are the most beautiful girls on this rock. Thanks for a really neat video!",

If you are not allowed to work you steal. That is logical, I would do the same. And we foolishly admitted Bulgaria in the EU. What a disgrace !!!!",

They steal and rape and have 3-4 houses each. They make 5+ babies and drug them so they can go to the streets and beg pretending to be homeless. I had many in my old neighbourhood, so I used to follow them to see what they do, they lived in houses that I can only dream of, close to caravans snd scrap yards. You cannot go in their villages, unless you have a death wish. They don't go to jail, even if they did, they have more than enough money to bail themselves. The worse part is that, they go to other EU countries and do the same, but they don't say they are gypsies bur they say they are Bulgarian. So they go and steal and do bad things and take benefits for the countless children that they have! And the result is that other countries think all Bulgarians are like that and no one wants us anywhere. I actually live in England because I don't feel safe in my own country. Many people don't believe that I am Bulgarian, they say I am too white to be Bulgarian. Because Bulgarian people rarely emigrate, mostly the gypsies and Turks do, pretending to be Bulgarian. So the rest of the EU doesn't really know us. I wish these gypsies never existed, their sheree existence have made my life very difficult and a living hell!",

Roma usually adopt the religions, culture & even adopt  common given names & surnames of their country of residence. In the middle East & Turkey, they are Muslims, in the Balkans they tend to be Orthodox Christian, Muslim or Catholic, depending on where they live. In Spain & France, mostly Catholic.¬†\nThere is linguistic evidence of Indian ancestry. Romani shares the basic lexicon with Hindi and Punjabi.\nAs a musicologist I have studied the links between the music of North Wester India & that of Roma from the Balkans. I don't believe that the  obvious influences of the former on the latter are accidental. \nIf you have alternative peer reviewed evidence in regard to DNA or any other evidence dismissing the link to India, please present it, as would be interested to see it.",

It is the black people in the usa that are truly segregated and oppressed. In BG, the communist regime actually managed to integrate gypsies into the society to some extent - gave them free housing, jobs and \"forced\" them to go to school. After the regime collapsed, the roma people withdrew and started building their own ghettos and abandoned the society - they don't want to live nearby us. Recent governments tolerate that because the aituation makes gypsies easy to manipulate during elections and also supplies immense amount of EU funds for the gypsy integration program (that does not achieve anything). Can you please elaborate the honesty part? My ethnic group is full of scumbags too but at least we try to build a normal society.",

Andalucia and the south of Spain actually identify themselves as heirs to the gypsy culture. It is interesting how in a Nation State like Spain the Gypsy culture has been taken as their unique and most particular identity.",

They even have a story they explains why in their own terms \"have the right to steal\". They also have a tale about why they're in Europe: Spoiler: they mooched off a king and ruined his shit instead of doing the work he paid them to do.

India is one of Origins but did you know that there used to be a river that connected Israel to India it was destroyed but you can very easily tie the Romani and Israel's together which is why I believe there are lost tribe of Israel",

But it is a completely wrong and unfortunate fact because it is confused with the Romanians in Romania, with the citizens of the city of Rome in Italy or with the former inhabitants of the Roman Empire !!! The correct and original word for this population is \"Dom\" or \"Lom\" in other dialects, not Rom. It is surprising how Romanians and Romania  accept this strange confusion. It is very likely that the name of Romani was imposed by evil intentional  forces against Romania, in order to denigrate this country and its inhabitants (probably for territorial concessions). An example would be, I think, George Soros - a Hungarian billionaire known in the world for his anarchic and strange measures. This man has numerous non-governmental organizations with which he succeeded in imposing this name in the early 90's, \n(taking advantage of the enormous corruption of the Romanian leaders)",

We have them also here in Slovakia , I live in small town near Hungarian borders and the population of the romanis (cigani) are half of the population of this city. And the situation is simillar to other countries, they refuse to work,  our government grooms them as pets , they have all kinds of benefits (free school suplies, free food in schools, free transportation ) even they get reward if their children go to school regularly, they alwas cry that they live in bad conditions and the government builds them housing that they wreck and they get new ones. they have many children from young age (when I was in hospital givin birth to my son, there was a 16 year old givin birth to her 3th!!!!!! child), when I go to shop or postoffice or playground they are always romani children beging for money at school time, they are dirty, smelly and rude, they shoplift often or rob someone. we have other kind of romani here - higher cast (olassky cigani), they work often abroad, have money, better houses, some of them are educated but those kind of romani are very rare.... here in slovakia we have one of the largest romani gheto in central europe called LUNIK 9 in Ko≈°ic city , take a look what have they done with the houses in few years https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xpd5INgzff4  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu1180bxts4 have fun watchin :D",

Making a living anyway a nomadic people could. They were seamstresses, fortune tellers, and \"fixer\" (repair) men and all too often and sadly, horse thieves and prostitutes. They carried with them their \"Hindi folklore\" often mixing it with Christianity and Islam and because there was no real surefire contraception, they're blood mixed with the male population wherever the roamed. But the Romani men looked away because \"business is business\" they held. They have settled down and integrated wherever they ended up as wandering the world in wagons has all but ended in our \"modern\" times. All in all they have a little of everyone's blood traveling through they're veins and are truly beautiful.",

    "commentText": "In Germany (and no racism here, as you might think), there was a sign put up on the border to poland, pointing out \"no gypsies welcome, entering is punishable by death\". This was pre-Hitler, under Imperial Law, which wasn¬¥t racist, compared to England or the US etc at that time. My great grandmother, whose family lived near the boarder, nevertheless, was kidnapped as a child (ca 4 years old) by a group of \"Romani\". The miller from the next village, which was approx. 5 miles away, saw her sitting and crying on a cart driven by the \"Romani\" and noticed her as being the daughter of one of his costumers, so she was able to be brought back by the townsmen. I do not think this was a custom, but kind of a reason why those \"nomadic\" people were prosecuted in such a harsh way back then in more \"civilized\" areas. I still remember her resemblances, which might be partially wrong after such a long time, but definetly they are chilling! Nowadays, of course, things changed, and the Tsigani or gypsies are a more or less ormalaccepted minority within most parts of Europe - but back then, things were different, and as I might suggest, not only exaggerated by our ancestors",

The Rom are often outsiders and some groups descend into theft, chicanery and begging. If the same demographic were applied as with other groups, I'm sure crime rates would not be significant. Let me give an anecdote myself. Most of my tribe settled in England between the wars, but I remade contact with Rom in the south of France and Northern Spain who are devout Christians and maintain a high moral code. I have Mitochondrial DNA from 46 countries from India, Iran through to Libya, Portugal, Italy and every country of Europe bar a few from the southern Urals to the Faro Isles as well as Rom. I am certain this diversity has given me many advantageous attributes. I am grateful to my Rom ancestors to their commitment to freedom and openness to other cultures and ethnicity and the spread of ideas and creativity.",

Other gypsies like my family are all musicians, have jobs , are good people and dont do that other shit. That's you people being close minded and judgemental.  Sorry u ran into the wild gypsies and had a bad experience but in Chicago on Northside if u met one of our kind u wouldn't say the things u people just said. That's like me judging whole black race, white, Asian, etc. For a few bad apples and some bad experiences. Smh gtfoh",

Even though some do.There is NO group on this planet that is above such illegal actions, inspite of what some want to say & think.  If another racist, oppressive group in power were to deny whites the same fair opportunities as those in power then you would see white-committed crimes.

They also did not want to integrate with the general population. There were many of Gypsies in Colombia in the 1970s, they lived in large communes and they have been in Colombia for centuries;  I know that a lot of them looked white and they mixed themselves with the white people from Spain.

That would be a pointer to mass liberals and tolerance propagators, that the Gypsy people as a whole are exclusively welfare queens and leech off of the main indigenous population of the country they are currently residing in. These, in turn, would give the contributor countries the much needed justification they can get, in order to use any means necessary for the integration, reintegration respectively of the Gypsy closed-off communities and structural societies,  be it forceful or through the direct application of the law, without the definite intervention of third party civil rights protection NGOs or other disarrangement on the so-called basis of racial prejudice activists. \n\nMy point being, wherever I've gone, they are under protection off of the law due to their racial background and the same laws do NOT apply to them, as they do to us, reasons being unconsequented bribery of officials , fear of being deemed racist or any other vaguely formed principle.",

They are a closed group and they prefer to live in this way. But many of them manage to evolve and integrate into the community they live in, and some become famous or very rich. Sadly the reality is harsh and I doubt it will change in the next centuries. Between 1600-1950 in the USA, the Italians or the Irish were considered a pest. Not to mention the Chinese or the Maxicans or the Black people. Time is passing. Today majority can become tomorrow minority in their own countries. Life keep goes on.",

They're mostly just beggars as far as I've seen, but I remember one encounter best.\n I was going back home from an extra preparatory lesson, and I held my hat in my hand. I was with with my mom, and when we turned a corner, I dropped my hat. When I looked back I saw nothing on the ground. There were a ton of people, but a gypsy beggar with her child was sitting on the ground. My mom luckily saw what happened, and demanded that the kid give my hat back. She reluctantly did, and we moved away fast. My mom warned me to always be careful next to them.\n What I got from this was that, they don't mind stealing at all, and they teach their kids how to do it at an early age. I don't wanna hate on an entire race so quickly, but all of my encounters with them has been negative.",

There was a homeless crackhead wandering my neighborhood that I enjoyed chatting with. I had a crashed car in my driveway that was technically totaled because of a bent chassis, but the interior was in good shape and so was almost everything under the hood. I gave him the key to the car so he could sleep in it, and he slept in it for weeks.\n\nOne day he asked me if he could sell the car battery for some pocket money. \"Sure, go ahead.\" Then one day, I came home from work and the car was gone. I freaked out. I found him down the block and he told me, \"I saw some people towing the car away. I thought the landlords called a tow company.\" I made him give me the name of the tow company and he gave it to me.\n\nI called them and demanded they bring back my car. They were like, \"Well, an older man 'sold' it to us, and he had the key so we didn't think anything of it.\" I asked what he looked like. \"Tall, skinny - oh, wait, that's him over there! Walking up the street!\" It was the crackhead. You know how much he \"sold\" my car for? $60 USD. I got one of my biggest, fattest, strongest male friends to chase him down and tell him that if he ever showed his face on my street again, he would kick his ass. And I do not regret it.",

They come on their own arcord, they're not being forcefully shipped here, so your comparison makes no sense. They're being naive, thinking there are jobs en masse here, but there is'nt, especially for hardly educated people. And instead they don't stop comming, almost all receive welfare, work illegaly, commit tax frauds and child benefit frauds. \n\n\nI don't pitty them, they brought this upon themselfes. You would'nt go to a country without any plans either. Oh and the worst thing is, they call us all nazis for their own desperation in their suffering. They aren't thankful, so guess what, we could'nt care less about these folks. They are driving off even the other foreigners of towns, what is left is whole parts dominated by gypsies and poverty.",

Most Medes fled East towards India. Haplogroup H is therefore the marker of the ancient Medes. Consult a haplogroup map and you'll see how the haplogroup spread from the Balkans to India due to spread of the Greek empire. Along with haplogroup H, Persian haplogroup E-V13 carriers were massively  made slaves by the conquering Greeks, carriers of haplogroup J.\nYou wanted to know the origin of Roma. Well, here you are! What you must realise is that the Middle East has undegone the fiercest battles in history which caused massive movement of populations. Most Middle Eastern people are Greeks!",

She was simply walking down the street with her mother in their neighborhood in the 1970s and out of nowhere came a Cadillac, Lincoln or some other large luxury car that pulled up alongside them and a scary-looking dark-complected woman opened the car door and tried to snatch the little girl. The friend's mother swears that it was gypsies in the car. And over in a small farming town in Iowa in the 1930s and 40s, my ex-husband's grandmother and her siblings were warned by their mother not to go down to the gypsy caravan that would show up once a year down by their small town's railroad tracks. They never knew where these gypsies came from or where they went, but the great-grandma was always fearful one of the children would be kidnapped.",

Unlike the Romani.\nIrish travellers seem to have come from a number of separate populations from a number of historic events spread out over 100s of years!\nOne idea is of them being distantly related to a Celtic group that invaded Ireland.(because Celts are not Irish or even Northen European they are from the area of Europe around Romania, Hungry etc) Another theory is of a pre-Gaelic origin, where Travellers are descended from a community that lived in Ireland before the arrival of the Celts. Once Ireland was claimed as Celtic, this group was seen as lower class. There is also a theory that an indigenous, itinerant, community of craftsmen are the ancestors of Travellers, and they never settled down like the Celts. Other speculations on their origin are that they were descended from those Irish who were made homeless during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in the 1650s, or made homeless in either the 1741 or the 1840s famine due to eviction.\nIrish Travellers have no pin point 1 original origin founding population not like Romani they are a mix of many peoples and many unfortunate events.

Very attractive blend.",

There is this great romance about them--the life on the move (diaspora), the traditional covered wagons, the crystal ball fortune tellers, and great violinists.  To me, the whole thing--including the modern cohesiveness and maintenance of the language--is a real delight, another member of the human family.  I pray for them, for their continuity, for their happiness.",

Just because they have a similar sounding name doesn't make them the same thing. And second of all, it is true, MOST gypsies are stealers, frauds and scum bags. And for those privileged American asses calling us (the people who don't particularly like romanis) racist, yall can go. I live in a country with a relatively high population of gypsies, and if you do as well, you'll probably understand why we have so much hatered for gypsies. I've seen and experienced so many gypsies stealing, begging for money even tho they're living in mansions,etc. They have earned their title for a reason",

I'm not saying they don't thieve, I'm saying that our entire continent doesn't have any native non Christian religion or language anymore, and that comes at price: systemic prejudice and suspicion. Let's face it, we still behave like the late asshole part of the Roman Empire.\nThieving has always been a symptom of poverty, Europe has never been very tolerant towards the different or poor. And I'm being serious here: how do we expect this people to \"get jobs and pay taxes\" if they don't have the same values as us? To pay taxes you must be a citizen but they're nomadic and not bound by a country or nation. You can't get a job or an education without a minimum of documentation, which allows you to get benefits and nothing else.\nI am just as prejudiced as any other European against Roma, i am not going to pretend otherwise. When in a real situation, my fear kicks in and I want nothing to do with them. And because of that, I try very hard to learn about them. My country is full of manipulative power hungry politicians who will use my personal faults and fears against me, and they can fuck off.",

So if you don't even value people within your own community or even family etc. then why would you value others outside of your community? Why value assimilation into a culture that rejects and treats you like garbage? It's a giant run-around that seems to feed itself over and over until nobody even thinks why someone is acting the way they are, all they know is they hate eachother and don't care enough to see the world from where eachother stands.",

They were walking by foot from one area to another with  their children, women and dogs. Those women had a strange ability to read palms and once they made their camp for two weeks in a place, women tend to walk in to our villages (usually two women at a time) for palm reading.  We gave them a coconut, or 10 rupees for a reading those days. We never let them in to the house. But i have never seen their present generation or a gypsy camp from a long time.  It seems they have vanished and their children have spreaded and have become workers in the cities where the small jobs are available.  During 80s, when i was a child, they came few times a year and those women were quick, sexually alluring and cunning.",

Sometimes we'd notice a whole bunch of them show up out of nowhere and set up camp on the soccer field in the village not far from my grandparents house. Of course it prevented anyone from using the soccer field for the week or so that they were there. During that time you would see them skulking around the village stealing all sorts of stuff. Then once they were gone the soccer field was a total mess with garbage strewn everywhere and the grass all ripped up.\n\n2nd was here in Canada when a few years ago some Gypsies started coming over from Romania and Slovakia. They would run various scams in Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa....maybe elsewhere too. I had an old Gypsy man with two plastic bags filled with \"groceries\", which were made to be ridiculously heavy and he'd come ask ask in an incomprehensible gibberish to help him carry his bags, which I did since I will always help the elderly, and then after walking a few feet away a younger guy slipped out from behind a wall and got behind me to try to pick my pocket. I caught on to him quickly enough to prevent it.",

The villagers weren't happy so the mayor had to come up with a sollution. Talking with the Romani people didn't make them leave, so after a few days he decided to send a truck to the camp, in the truck there was a soundsystem and a deejay-booth. A local Belgian deejay showed up and started to play crappy Belgian carnaval-tunes (volume level 10), the mayor was convinced this would drive away the Roma. In stead they all came out of their tents and their mobile homes and they started to dance , it was a huge party. The mayor's face was priceless :) I never laughed so hard watching the journal (y)",

Anyone saying differently deserves the title of, idiot.  It certainly is a problem for many Roma parents when their daughters turn 12.  It's even more of a problem for the girls because they've reach marrying age.  Many girls of this age, are bartered off as brides within the Roma community.  This type of behaviour is totally unacceptable.  These unfortunate girls have had their childhood stolen from them.  They have to endure years of statutory rape.  There is no place for this type of backward culture within a modern society.  So yes, it is time for the Roma to assimilate into modern society.",

I don't think you would be happy ,and Andy ,I wouldn't wish it on any Roma family to have to live next door to an ignorant motherfucker such as yourself",

Initially known as Paddylocks this was shortened to padlock through time.

I don't think it's true, but most latvians think they have gypsy heritage. It might also be some confusion, because we are of indo-european origin, and so are the real gypsies. It's also similar to the jewish myth in Latvia, that we are descended from jews, which is also extremely common. It's weird, I don't believe it, especially since most people think that chigani and jews are basically the same thing, which just tells of their intelligence.",

    "commentText": "Romani is a neologism invented(in Romania, hence their unoriginal invention) this century(21st), and they never called themselves roma until extremely recently(and most of them, like the turkish gypsies, still do not use it), and they did call themselves gypsies, due to their mythos of being from egypt.\nRomanians are NOT similar at all with the \"romani\". Romanians are genetically 43% slavic, 20% daco-roman, 17% different anatolian groups(including turkic and greek), and a bunch of other south-european and central-european additions, with some 7% migratory siberian groups. NOTHING to do with the indians. Thanks for the ignorance though. The distinction is there because it is reality. Romanian is also a latin language. The haplogroup studies are out, and it was never an honest intellectual question if the romani and romanians are closely related.\nThey are also indian. I don't understand the south asian decription. It's the Indian subcontinent for a reason.\nOne other important detail which was missed is that they all came in one wave of migration, so they are at the root one ethnicity.\nThere are indeed other groups which are called gypsies, which have nothing to do with the indian gypsyes, and are basically slavic groups or from the russian steppes, like turkic groups, but that is an historical coincidence of language, describing many non-sedentary groups with the same word.\nAlso, your sources are rather worthless.None having journaled studies, nothing peer-reviewed, and even the one which seems academic in nature(although having no accreditation of any kind) has the stated purpose of being an activist project.\nRather pseudo-intellectual video content.",

Although they don't just 'like Romany culture' they just have a similar nomadic lifestyle and their has been some intermarriages that have led to people with both Traveller and Roma heritage.   Personally, I am of Romanichal descent through my Grandfather (1/4), he left England in the 60's with his family looking for better work and basically decided to hide his heritage, my father was only 4 at the time so he has very few memories before that time. My Grandfather died when I was very young and the Romany culture had very little impact on my life, so I would never say that I am Romany.",

Many German families I know have a broken family structure with a lot of hate and ignorance.\n\nI will not question your experiences but i do judge you for being such a piece of shit that is judging an entire group of people who live in Europe for over 10.000 years and never have shown real aggression  towards others who dont harm them.

Spirituality is the opposite of what you just wrote about. It has NOTHING to do with history. It has only to do with finding who YOU are. You are NOT your body and you are DEFINETLY NOT your ancestors history or what ever bongo they have played on. You have just proven my point.\n\nAnd in regards of giving you \"evidence\" or a proper source to when Gypsies or their ancestors have came to Europe and settled down, I cant but neither can you. Why? Because our history books are no real history books. They are books of war. They dont tell anything about why some groups migrated the way they did, they dont tell who contributed what to society. They only talk about who killed who and the VERY recent history also involved inventions etc, but its a new phenomenon because Europeans destroyed so much ancient knowledge in the past that we barely know anything.\n\nI wish you best luck improving yourself. You have a small identity which causes your intelligence to work against yourself (producing bad experiences based on outside events). Until you realize that you are the entire cosmos because everything you see is projected within yourself and not outside, you will finally start to become spiritual.",

Cate justificari le gasesti paganilor, toate crimele lor le justifici. De fapt tu insuti esti un pagan, asa ca nici o surpriza. Exista si o descriere a unor sacrificii umane in timpul unor ceremonii pagane practicate de \"Rus\" - vikingi, nu slavi! - facuta de un arab, Ahmad Ibn Fadhlan. Te apuca greata cand citesti!\nCrestinismul e cel care a adus in lume iubirea (crestina), compasiunea, mila, iertarea si celelalte virtuti. Crestinismul a schimbat in bine lumea, din pacate adevarata credinta in Dumnezeul Cel Viu a fost prigonita mereu in istorie, ba de pagani, ba de atei, ba de eretici. Biserica Crestina a fost persecutata crunt de noii pagani, de atei, chiar in secolul trecut. Si in ziua de azi, crestinii din Orientul Mijlociu au fost aproape nimiciti de ISIS.",

Din ignoranta crezi in paganism si dintr-o ura impotriva lui Dumnezeu pe care eu, sincer, n-o inteleg. Daca ai cunoaste crestinismul cu adevarat, nu din ce scrie in cartile de istorie anti crestine, ci teologia, istoria Bisericii Crestine primare, sfintii si asa mai departe (si, mai ales, daca l-ai trai), n-ai scrie lucrurile pe care le scrii aici. ,Iudaismul, adica Legea lui Moise, invata in mod acoperit (pentru ca evreii de atunci nu erau pregatiti sa primeasca revelatia in intregime - asa cum un sugar nu poate sa manance carne, ci lapte - deci, Legea lui Moise invata in mod acoperit despre Dumezeu Cel in Treime slavit: Tatal, Fiul si Duhul Sfant. Ceea ce lumea numeste \"iudaism\" (eu il numesc \"talmudism\"), adica religia in care cred astazi evreii, este cu totul altceva, nu este Legea lui Moise, nu este credinta vechilor evrei. Citeste cartea \"Povara a trei milenii de istorie si de religie iudaica\" de Israel Shahak (un evreu) si o sa vezi in Talmud si in Cabala un paganism in toata hidosenia lui. Nici vorba acolo de credinta intr-un singur Dumnezeu, dimpotriva, e politeism!",

It is so falsely measuring the intrinsic importance of evidence, and the character of proof, that the person rejecting the scriptures because of it would prove nothing but his own incompetency to measure evidence. A book two thousand years old has a mistake in a sentence, which the omission of a word entirely rectifies, without changing anything-a word very likely to creep in.\"\n\nProblema ta este ca ai o idee gresita despre Biblie.

Din experienta proprie iti spun ca atat timp cat esti ateu (cum a fost cazul meu) sau necredincios, diavolii nu s-au facut simtiti, nici n-am crezut in existenta lor. Doar dupa ce am inceput sa cred si am incercat sa ma apropii de Dumnezeu, doar atunci m-au atacat. Tu acum n-ai cum sa stii lucrurile astea, numai daca ai veni la credinta cea adevarata si te-ai stradui sa te apropii de Dumnezeu, numai atunci vei vedea ce este lupta spirituala si cum te ispitesc sau te ataca duhurile rele. Astia te lasa in pace acum pentru ca esti al lor.\n\n\"Ai halucinatii puternice\" LOL N-am nici o halucinatie. Locul unde m-a atacat (plexul solar) a devenit si mai sensibil decat in mod obisnuit. Mult timp nici n-am putut sa-l ating, ma deranjeaza chiar si o patura subtire sau un cearsaf care apasa pe locul ala. \nNu esti singurul apostat care lupta impotriva Dumnezeului Celui Viu, a mai fost un oarecare Iulian Apostatul, de exemplu. Inainte de a muri, Iulian ala a zis: \"M-ai invins, Galileene!\" (asa i se adresa lui Iisus Hristos!)\n\n\"daca erai atacat nu supravietuiai\" -- Ti-am zis sa citesti viata Sfantului Antonie cel Mare. El a fost multi ani atacat noaptea de demoni care il lasau abia viu. Tu nu stii ca daca Dumnezeu nu le ingaduie, demonii nu au putere sa-ti ia viata si sufletul? Cand m-a atacat chestia aia, s-a izbit de pieptul meu ca de o platosa! Si de fiecare data, dupa atac, imi aminteam cuvintele lui Dumnezeu din Vechiul Testament, cartea lui Iov, cand i-a zis diavolului: \"Dar de sufletul lui [al lui Iov] sa nu te atingi.\"\nTe joci de-a paganismul si crezi ca poti sa-L infrunti pe Dumnezeu - asta e nebunie!

One is a university professor in bio-chemistry and another is a household patriarch in the heartland. Both have found that the younger generations, while still connected to family/culture, are pressing themselves into modern US society with ease. The Roma professor likes to engage his Indian and some Pakistani Students with a language game. They get all flustered and laugh when their words match or have roots with one another. My experiences have been \"so far so good.\" I believe it is more of a persecution thing with popular culture than isolationist tendencies. Immigrants to a new land who do not know the language then attempt to become part of society while balancing family and cultural heritage. Boy, where does that sound familiar? Oh, yes, these United States of America and almost all Ethnic groups that have come in the last couple of centuries. That's a whole broad topic for another day considering how many cultures are clashing now with homogeneous melding with multi-cultural lifestyles as technology connects us to our \"roots.\"",

In the past in Romania they were skilled craftsmen in metal working, but with developing of industry, vast majority of them don't work anymore and prefer to practice other trades, from begging to organised crime. They travel in groups and stick with each other if they get into trouble with Romanians they are very aggressive, assaulting them verbally until the poor guy prefer to walk away (after they tried to stole his wallet or something). Calling the police on them is useless since they are moving to another zone after one incident, unless you want to spend valuable time on the police station. They have low regard for human life, they sell their children between them in marriage at  from very low age, and they multiply like rabbits (one children means income and leverage in front of law, not responsibility).\nI used to work on Police Special Forces when I was younger and we had to raid a gypsy house in a gypsy ghetto. It was about a case of human trafficking. We entered the big house (almost like a palace) they were sleeping on the floor with horses indoors (they love their horses) and after we took the persons of interests the women started the show. They didn't care about the guns aiming they had to be immobilised aswell. One of them had a children sucking at her breast and used him as a throwing weapon at me from 5 meters, I was lucky to catch him. In most of these cases they have to be protected from them selfs since they tend to provoke self injuries and accuse police brutality. This is just a glimpse of who the gypsies from Romania are. Unfortunately when things at home worked very slow (Romanians spotted them from a mile away) they moved to other hunting grounds across Europe. I was educated not to discriminate but I am sorry to say they are hopeless. We have all kinds of special programs for them they just don't want to change.",

The highest legal job I've seen a gypsy have in my 25 years of living in Romania was a street cleaner. I'm sure there are better gypsies across the Ocean , but they are for sure the minority that if I were to judge by the numbers explained in the video make maybe 10% of the whole population. It's so easy to find a bad gypsy example that all you have to do is walk on a street with a slightly visible gypsy population and wait to be somehow \"initiated\" in some fortune telling how the video would say. I think the most discusting moment I had to see was when my uncle had to dodge hitting a gypsy 5 year old with the car. He was visibly pushed in front of the road by his older brother. If we would of hit the kid the crowd of gypsies would then try to blackmail us. NOT CALL THE POLICE  because we killed the kid, but blackmail us for money like they did before with other unfortunate drivers.",

Now I could try to find a reason for this, especially regarding black communities, in the fact that, after slavery was abolished, they were still segregated and not given equal chance to a proper education and jobs so, over the generations they resorted to violence and crime to make ends meet. This behavior entrenched itself into their culture and now, when they would have equal opportunities, they still self segregate and whenever one of them tries to make something out of themselves and abandon this lifestyle of crime and violence, by going for higher education and trying to get a decent job, they are judged by their own community as 'acting white'.",

Albanians are not Dardanians, there is not a single evidence for that claim,  they actually came from Caucasian Albania (modern Dagestan), The name is the same, the toponyms are the same, the folklore is the same. Check it out. They were bought by a Roman general George Maniakes in XI century as paid soldiers to fight on his side against Muslims in Sicily. They lost that battle. Some of them stayed in Sicily, but most of them were expelled and have nowhere to go. By the grace of the Serbian king at that time they were given scarcely inhabited land at that time, south of Serbian city of Skadar na Bojani (modern Albanian Skoder). Even the name of the river stayed Serbian. That is why most of the customs in Albania and Sicily are the same (blood revenge for example). Because Albanians usually have close to 10 or more children, what was then a small group of people over time became a threat to Serbia and now they are what you just showed ina single sentence, people who only know: to threat, deal drugs, kill, rape, and take what isn't yours. Some phoney myths to justify the violence will never change the truth.",

He was born in a Serbian family in Austro-Hungarian Empire in a village that is in today's Croatia. So he was a Serb born in what is today's Croatia. He had Croatian papers (passport) and went to Croatian schools.\n\nRight from google. The world already has the truth. Look up his interview moron, he literally says he is a Serb. How can u call someone who is serbian orthodox a Croatian. It's just stupid. Look, I know Croats have no one to talk about, but it's not our fault. My grandmother is from Croatian and is Serbian orthodox, she would never call herself Croatian if there was a gun pointed at her. Literally just go on YouTube, which you already are on, and you will see what his own words are. Or you can refuse and confirm why every Serb laughs at Croats.",

    "commentText": "Gypsies are a true part of European Christian culture. In France they are the most christian group within the population. In Romania - the name comes from the Roman Empire, not from Romi - they used to follow localy existing churches and cultures. This is why some of them are Romanian orthodox christians, others speak Hungarian and there is even a tiny group of German lutheran Gypsies in Northern Transylvania.\nThis is changing, as many Gypsies now go to neoprotestant free churches, where they are treated as equals, not as bystanders.\nThis minority's fate seems to be a feudalistic system, where the ones on top get super rich and have extreme power over the common Gypsy. This can have a very positive side, if someone like the old Gipsy king Cioba is busy in improving the situation of his people. But it can also be negative, if a clan boss - in Romania called Bulibasha - commands his folks to get money by begging in other countries or by trading with gold, girls, horses, drugs, stolen car's and so on. \nThey have excellent musicians and craftsman.\nSerious concerns are because of marriages with very young girls and because of making children to beg from silly tourists.\nThe future depends - in my humble opinion - on breaking the feudalistic power of clan leaders and on getting out of the nomadic orientation. They have to see themselves as a settled down and valuable part of European society. They have to stop looking on other groups as a source of income, but have to make their income through serious business.",

The Chinese, Japanese, American aboriginals are Mongolians. Obviously the Africans are Africans. Every other race group we created are either evolved/merged  from the three mentioned races above. The white people of Europe didn't want to accept this basic truth and created all kinds of other races to meddle and mingle their identity. White Europeans are basically a group of melanin deprived Dravidians (anglo Indians). Its' akin to a decease called albinism. It's been know for a long time, almost over 100 years. When a skeleton was discovered in Britain in 1903 the scientist were taken aback with bewilderment and didn't know what to make of that discovery. It took almost 115 years before they released the result calling \"original human of Britain, the cheddar man\". It turned out he was dark skinned and dark haired person. The founder of the caucasians.\nThe Gypsy are the later arrivals from Persia not from India. They might have went from India some 10,000 years ago.",

Then I was just watching a wedding dress thing and gypsy getting married and I guess they go all out and nothing is to over the top which I love that haha but watching that are me more interested so decided to search utube about what gypsies really are and how they came about and what not. In only 2:12 mins in. So far but I do think what everybody is saying is very cruel and should not be said every body has hard times in there lives and they just grew up and learned differently from everybody else. Not all gypsy people are cruel and mean like every body is saying I'm sure. But sometimes u have to do what u got to do to survive and some may not agree with what's being done but there are some who change and don't harm others or steal I'm sure but I still have alot to learn but if just always been interested in the gyspys since I was young and loved the way they dressed and looked lol :)",

A European parent may not teach their kids how to cook but they will teach them why they should hate other people. And their education system tells them not to trust anyone even their parents. A Saudi colleague's kids were told at a UK school that they should not trust anyone and if their parents hit them they should tell it at school. And due to all this, the end result is that the European kids start hating their parents as soon as they develop understanding of their own. At 18 they leave their parents and the parents sadly die alone in old homes like discarded commodity due to Parkinson or Alzheimer's disease. You do not have to go too far back in the European history to realise what their hate is capable of, just 73 years. 1945 when Germans and their Hungarian, Romanian, Bulgarian allies did to Jews, Romas in Europe. British and their allies did to Bengalis in India and  Blacks in America and Africa. Sadly now they feel they are the victims of time.",

Also, ich sehe keinen Grund, die Holocaustfrage regelm√§√üig ohne jeden Sinn zu beantworten, weil sie ohne jeden Kontext nur gestellt wird, um den Befragten auf irgendetwas festzulegen und die Diskussion vom eigentlichen Punkt wegzubewegen. Wie man oben lesen kann, das hat der von Ihnen zitierte Kommentator getan.\nAnsonsten ist in Deutschland das Leugnen des Holocaust verboten, Sie werden also √ºber dieses Thema niemals eine ehrliche Diskussion zustande bringen. Das, was Sie dazu geschrieben haben, ist die offizielle Antwort, die man schreiben darf. Im Ausland findet man aber Diskussionen, die einige punkte davon schwer in Frage stellen. Unser Gesetz hindert uns daran, das zu diskutieren, aber nicht, das wahrzunehmen. Die Wahrheit liegt mutma√ülich irgendwo zwischen diesen Punkten: Es sind ohne Zweifel viele Juden gestorben, in der Zeit von 1938-1945. Details sind unm√∂glich einem Faktencheck zu unterziehen, jedenfalls nicht bei uns. Es sind auf keinen Fall 6 Millionen Juden einem Brandopfer (Holocaust) zum Opfer gefallen. Der Fakt, dass es ein Gesetz gibt, das die Meinungsfreiheit und wissenschaftliche Aufarbeitung einschr√§nkt, spricht daf√ºr, dass es etwas zu besch√ºtzen gibt. √Ñhnliches habe ich bereits erlebt, in der von der Sowjetunion besch√ºtzten DDR gab es bestimmte \"historische fakten\", die man ebenfalls nicht ansprechen durfte. Als dieser Schutz wegfiel, erwies es sich, dass die Besatzungsmacht ein propagandistisches Bild \"historischer Fakten\" aufgestellt hatte, um ihre Verbrechen zu verbergen. Beispiel: Die Flutung der Berliner U-Bahn-Sch√§chte bei der Eroberung der Stadt, das den Nazis zugeschrieben wurde. Eine Vielzahl solcher Erfahrungen und ein generell im wissenschaftlichen Kontext sinnvolles kritisches Denken l√§sst mich also an offiziellen Darstellungen schnell zweifeln. Zu einem \"denier\" / Leugner macht mich das nicht.",

Ergo kann die Antwort, wenn erzwungen, nur in ihrem Sinne ausfallen.\nAnsonsten gibt es ein Problem, wenn Sie von genau \"dem\" Holocaust sprechen. Sie k√∂nnen dann nur noch die Gesamtheit des Stattfindens best√§tigen oder ablehnen (und Ablehnen ist verboten). Sie sagen, dass er genau so passiert ist, dokumentiert und gut belegt (was dasselbe ist). Die Frage ist also, ob Sie die Hand ins Feuer legen w√ºrden f√ºr jeden einzelnen Beleg. Und was w√ºrde daraus folgen, wenn jemand, der nicht unserer Jurisdiktion unterliegt, einzelne von Ihnen f√ºr absolut wahr gehaltene Belege √ºberzeugend widerlegt. Ist dann \"der\" Holocaust in seiner Gesamtheit falsch? Ist er ein Dogma?\nMeine Schlussfolgerung ist etwas differenzierter, und es ist wie dargelegt schwierig, das juristisch einzuordnen, ob das erlaubt ist oder nicht. Als Ja-Nein-Frage m√∂chte ich dar√ºber keine Aussage treffen. \"Solche\" Ansichten teile ich M√ñGLICHERWEISE teilweise.

This jive turkey completely forgets how many millions are found in just the EU alone. They have their own separate clan identity, yet intermarry with each other.\n\nWorld's best known Gypsy is Elvis who is a blend of Sinti-kalabash. Yep there is irish traveller gypsy blended in as well, thru Vernon's side.  In sweden which made a huge mistake of allowing balkan gypsies from commie yugoslavia, albania, kosovo and their well organized crime gangs. \n\nLiterally overnight there was a reign of terror caused by these criminals. Sweden was so stupid they did not make each family go thru the same rigorous visa process they make every other nationality do. They also made that colossal mistake with the arabs and moo-slimes they now regret to come in. \n\nGypsies refuse to assimilate, moo-slimes refuse to assimilate, they prefer to play the victim gimme-grant role. I still don't understand why all of these trash elements are not sent back to the deepest parts of africa, and they can make the same trek their distant ancestors did to leave africa. At least it will give them something to do, just to survive being out in the desert",

Almost none of them work and yet most men drive with expensive cars! But now they are filling the prisons because 2018 electronic surveillance makes their culture of stealing so much more difficult. Young Romani men are to be seen much less than say 10 years ago. They are now facing their biggest challenges yet. They should educate themselves but the problem is that the words work and studying is like an insult which they often react to by spitting after saying those words. Women are no better off, they are also filling prisons because they try to do frauds with little success, resulting in jail for them as well. How on earth can they start to assimilate into our western culture is the big question, they all speak Finnish like us but the similarities ends there I'm afraid.",

I am a discriminator and I have preconceptions which, given the state of things, I have no intention of getting rid of. I live in Milan and my only experience is with Romani in Milan, Rome, Venice, Paris, Lyon, Munich, Prague and Kosice. Every contact was characterised by anti-social and criminal behaviour. The vast majority of Gypsies in Europe decline state assigned housing and elect to live in trailers and shanty towns, they do not want \"9 to 5\" jobs, but they do use loopholes to have access to social support and funding. They find nations like Italy which has a criminal code way more lenient than the ones in their originating countries (usually Bulgaria) and they live a parasitical and anti-social life to the expense of the local population. For example the weaker classes of their societies are used to commit minor crimes since the legal punishment will be quasi-non-existant, minors are sent to burglarise homes, pregnant women are sent on public transport to pickpocket travelers, if caught kids might go to juvie, but usually don't, and pregnant women are only incarcerated for major violent crimes. In European nations the Romani peopole are a cost and one that takes and does not give back anything in return.",

Let me give you an example of what i mean: my mother works in child protection and there is this one roma girl that they had to put in protection because she was supposed to be murdered for going on a date with a turkish boy. The mother has multiple times met her in the child protection office, trying to convince her to come back and accept a new penalty given by the tribal chief. the mother is desperate because she and her family is being shuned and as she can't read or write nor learned any trait she is in total dependancy on her tribe. Her sons engagement was also cancelled and he lost his job and won't find a new one in his community. The king then came to their home and sold everything they owned and threw them out of their own home, all as punishment for not controlling their daughter. And now please tell me how living together with that community is supposed to work? How can a democracy tolerate a totalitarian, tribal monarchy within itself? How can we accept physical punishment on tribal law within our community? The answer is simple, we can't. So eather we rip them apart and force them to assimilate (which is what i guess happened in the us naturaly by the big physical division from the larger roma population), or we let them live as outcasts in their own communities under total observation as we can not accept a state within a state or any other law than the federal german.",

Even in the most liberal nations in Europe you have extreme discrimination against Gypsies. For example in my country of Iceland a gypsie can't enter the country if there are children with the people. Gypsie beggars are regularly robbed by the locals and often assaulted. If a gypsie is caught begging here in Iceland he will be deported and he will have no chance in courts. Most of our Gypsie population is either in prison, in school (yes Gypsies can learn it was a shock for me) or they are hatd working people that pay their taxes.",

I respect it now because that is now they keep the community and culture, but in my case it was love unrequited. This can be fixed however. Other than that, people are people. Kale rash can fix anything, some Sinti still play jazz, some are addicted to video games, while others are teachers, doctors, lawyers, judges, and cops. They have been around the US since before it was the US. Don't see King Of The Gypsies, that is trash, loosely based on one clan Tene Bimbo, and those guys give a bad name to everybody else. If Bernie Madoff is not typical of all the Jews (of course not!) then the same goes for those few Gypsie bad apples compared to the millions in the Americas who are good citizens.

You yourself are settled and living a productive and honest life.  I don't have an issue with you being settled or otherwise, but the fact you are living by contributing to your community is key.  The issue most of us have with Roma, throughout the Ameri-European eigth of the globe, stems from the dirt-poor travelling ones who for whatever reason can't seem to make an honest living and go around leeching from every community and committing an inordinate amount of petty crime.  There are so many of these bad apples and the numbers show it clearly.   There are travellers in the UK who are not of Roma descent, who live a similar lifestyle, commit a similar disproportion of petty theft/scam crimes and are the bane of many communities when they show up and rob the villages blind.  They are hated upon for the exact same reasons, and have traditionally been called gypsies as well, despite not being Roma.    A rich father of a friend of mine once had 'gypsies' move into a field next to his factory.  He installed some fresh-water taps on the side of his building, for them to use as they pleased.   They stole the tap and plumbing.   Thank you for posting, I find the history very interesting.",

Not good writer or speller have to rely on spell check & preemptive sentencing  to do this )\nCushty Divvis !",

You personally can be proud of your accomplishments and so I am sure are your parents (and rightly so!), but as statistics doesn't say anything about an individual so does one individual not represent all the properties of a group.",

But you can change the name of the shit to butterflies it still will be shit! \nBut true fact, westerners can't tell the difference between Romanians and Gypsies, even tho they are 100% obvious! \nIt's like you could not tell the difference between an Arab and a German!",

I, and others I know well, have had some negative experiences with gypsies in a few cities in America, and they solidified all the stereotypes one grows up hearing about them (my relatives in various places in Europe tell me bad stories about them too).  However, I'm very glad to know that many (I'm sure many) Roma, such as yourself, aren't like that (hopefully a growing number).\n\nI loved your opening comment. Bravo!",

You have your own Gypsies in Serbia and you wouldn't like others to say, \"look, these are Serbs\", would you?) So, my question is: how do you know they are from Romania? \nLet me tell you what happened a few years ago in Germany. A Romanian official went to Germany and met the officials in I don't remember what German town. They talked business or whatever, and after that the Romanian official was taken to a place where he saw a Gypsy beggar. The Germans told him that he is a Romanian Gypsy beggar and asked him to do something with him because it is not okay to beg on streets. Then the Romanian official asked the Gypsy beggar in Romanian, what is his name, what is he doing there, how did he arrived there etc., only to find out that that Gypsy beggar was from Serbia, he didn't speak Romanian language, but he was claiming that he is Romanian! \nAnother fact: Serbian Gypsies came to Romanian border with Serbia and asked political system, claiming that in Serbia they are persecuted!\nReally, I'm sick of fake \"Romanian Gypsies\" who claim they are Romanians and spoil the image of our country!\nIf you want to send those Gypsies somewhere, send them to India since they came from India!",

After one week he got his pay, and since that day I did not seen him again. We soon found that he stole tools and products. Since this \"enriching\" experience, I decided to avoid to hire gypsies in my company. Their bad reputation is not unmotivated; nevertheless, I believe that there must be also good hearts among them. But better avoid them as much as possible. \nAlso, I find Roma or Romani very confusing - they are not Romans, nor ethnic Romanians, as is so well explained in the here presented document. Gypsies, Cigani or Tsigani are much more appropriate, for avoiding confusions. If they consider this as insulting, then we should consider a name related to their ethnic place of origins, in the Indian sub-continent!",

It is an european problem not only an eastern one.... and by the way, they are gypsis...what romani means ? Rome will be offended... also by calling them like that you erase them from the history, in all books, literature and so on are called gypsis.. and they should be proud about it and start working their ass, and be normal...not just leaving garbage and misery behind them. Also this stupid political correctness and human rights is also amplifying their lazyness instead of putting them to work...during communism they were silent, now with democracy...meh.",

I mostly hear them say things similar to a colective mindset. For example if you beat one gypsy, then his whole family up to the 3rd or 4th grade cousins would come back to you and go as far as kill you. This.... It is somehow pretty neat, they're really united, but only among their clan... They have more clans, and in some cases they would clash and fight eachother with the purpose to kill. They really have no regard to human life outside their own clan... You stay to think what really drives them to do such things... Again, we tried integration, didn't work... They simply refuse the modern society as if it would be nuclear poison...",

Not saying that they did not immigrated or only a fraction of their DNA is or can be that,much more mixed up with many other. They are not Indians,period and full stop. We have many gypsy races in different regions of India and many of them are talented musicians and dancers and in fact, Rajasthani kalbelia dancers are world renowned and so are the folk singers. So keep your fucking racism against Indians somewhere else because this has nothing to do with our subcontinent now and these people are not part of it. Also big mouthed criticism Is very easy but what has any government of any country has given to them like education or opportunities to flourish and do on? The kind of racism I am seeing on the threads are make by it clear what kind of people and which countries are they coming from. If you don't include them then they will also not like to include themselves to your society,it is as simple as that and you didn't do that from the very beginning and they were left behind in progressions of the rest of the world and that is not entirely their fault. I can go on and on,but for those who are racist fuckers with your tiny square boxed tunnel vision shaped mentality,white or otherwise,I do not see the need as they will try to bring down any race which will be based on color and creed. Spread your shithead attitude elsewhere,india has nothing to do with it at all.",

We Romanians are very laborers, intelligent, poor children do not go to other countries to steal, poor children go to work site to earn an honest ban. From very young ages. From 12-15 years children in romania begin to go to work on the site and other places to earn an honest ban on the summer vacation. (The holiday that we receive between the 3-month school years.)

Bitch told us we're not fair enough to the gipsies and we're mean and shit and people started booing her and throwing shit at her. Well, when you live scared for your life in like the NICE neighborhoods of a capital city (Bucharest) and have been assaulted multiple times, had bike stolen, wallet, phone, every single time by a gypsy, you start having a different view of this. And it's really not racism based. It's not like other minorities, they outright refuse to be civilized and conform to anything. Fuck goverment rules, they don't even conform to hygiene and basic societal rules. All despite the fact that the Romanian goverment gives them A FK TON of benefits like places in high rated highschools, indifferent of their actual grades. So please cut the crap with the discrimination. If you saw this with your own eyes you'd see how ridiculous it is. If anything, everyone around them is being discriminated against for being put in the same bag. I'm almost ashamed to go in any major capital because they made sure to embarass us everywhere.",

They even gave me my lighter back after just asking for it (they asked for the lighter to start the conversation). Moral of the story, just treat everyone as equals because we indeed are all the same. My only bad experience was with a white junkie tbh even then I managed to get away just by talking.",

    "commentText": "In some sources about religion there might be a monotheistic mountain-god or similar.\nPunjab/Rajasthan seems to be the area they inhabited.\nThe exodus correlates with the Islamic conquest of Northern India.\nThey might have been of a very low caste or high caste. Or rather a high caste that somehow  was outside of that system.\nThe mountain-god and the high-caste-theory together with a culture where you are on the move could suggest a mountain-herding group of people.\nThe reason why they/we where called gypsies is because of Egypt but not because of actual Egypt but because of from my tongue \"little egypt\" which was basically western Greece.\nIt was a rich place at the time (Byzantine Empire... *coughs*)\nThere are stories of a people living on an island there.\n\nSwedish Travelers came to Stockholm in Sweden 1512 (Before Gustav Adolfius).\nClaiming to be a duke with company from \"egypt\".\n\nThey where in Denmark by 1410.\n\nEarly Swedish Travelers and later immigration of the so called \"gypsies\" in the 1800:s have very different cultures.\n\nAs to phenotype.\nWell. I'm blue-eyed. Really white. Very dark blonde to brown hair.\nSome cousins have dark skin.\n\nThe Roma peoples have been very poorly treated in Sweden.\nMy grandmother (born before 1900) had some child taken away from her when they tried to force them to be \"swedish\".\nAs they did with the Sami people.\nThey force-sterialized them. (threatened the children if they did not comply).\n\nThe big problem was that travelers or Romani where not allowed to settle down.\nThere where laws prohibiting it. Until very late.\nMy father (born -33) wouldn't approve of me outing myself as a romani descendant.\nThe stigma it has is really bad. Despite him also having blue eyes.\n\nI would say the criminality came with the status and not the way around.\nThere where no social services and if you didn't have food you died.\nThey took on the jobs nobody wanted.\nIncluding small metalwork like tinning copper pots.\nHorse-trading. Selling stuff walking the road (which wasn't much like roads today and no cars).\nThey fought in quite a few wars for the Swedes and it seems like they where well liked as fighters.\nI'm doubtful that that would be a trait in genetics although there seems to  have been quite a bit of fighting and rough living that might have made them well suited to fighting.\n\nI sorta miss the history of my ancestors.\nThe language. The dances. The songs.\n\nOne of the reasons Romani where so opposed where that they where though to be spies of the Muslim Ottomans when in many cases they fled from them (or traveled with them doing what work they could).",

In Serbia, where I was travelling with my mother, they surrounded our car at a gas station and started shacking it, because we refused to give them money. We had to pretend that we are about to drive over them, so they would run away.\n2. In Lithuania, my homeland, we had a gypsy guy in my school. He stole everyone's things, even ,y best friend's jacket (he was later seen in it). He went to jail at the age of 16 for 6 years (probably for a murder), and is dead now himself (killed by his ex friend).\n3. In Russia, when I was 7 years old. My mother, I, and my uncle, we were in a train and gypsies surrounded my mother and started 'foretelling'. While one of them stole my mum's purse. Fortunately, my uncle saw it and kicked the shit out of them and returned the purse back.\n4. In Jordan, local gypsy girl asked me for money and I refused to give any. She started hissing somethig and pinched me in my arm.\n\nAs you can see, they really deserve to be hated.",

They believe that lying and scamming is totally ok.  It shocks me  that they have been in Europe for 1000 years or whatever and they still can't emulate European life.  Their houses and lifestyle look like they JUST came from India/Pakistan, where they live looks like poor parts of India.  Maybe they'd be happier if they migrated BACK to India?",

When Communism came to Eastern Europe, they were forced to work, but they didn't have any education, so they worked the lowest jobs. Some managed to get an education and became productive members of society, but most lived in poverty. \n\nThen Communism fell and many of them fled to Western Europe, saying they are persecuted and they got asylum. There their \"talents\" came in handy. Robbery, prostitution, human trafficking has led to many Gypsies making fortunes. They have built palaces in Eastern Europe, they control the police and the politicians. The majority of the Gypsies still live in poverty, even if the state has Affirmative Action policies for them in place, they still don't want to go to school and get normal jobs. The politicians are happy with the status quo, because the Gypsies all vote for the Socialists - the former Communists, and that's a good chunk of the votes, because they all go and vote. Their reputation is deserved, even if some of them are nice people. \n\nThey are quite an interesting society, having their own laws, their own local leaders, judges, kings.   \n\nI have a few Gypsy friends, grew up with them in our village, but since they were the only Gypsy family, they assimilated within the local culture. One of the girls has a Ph.D and works in a German University, the other is an engineer in Holland. The boys are now in the UK, they say they are from India :)",

I've been witness to quite a few unfortunate incidents.  But the funniest had to be when I saw a group of Portuguese Gypsies start a fight with Bulgarian Gypsies because the Bulgarians had moved in and started taking their jobs, which was pan-handling at a certain Lisbon intersection.  And the most racist thing I ever heard in Europe was in the back of a crowded bus, filled with all kinds of races including Gypsies, and the Gypsies were loudly talking shit about the blacks, the Chinese, the Indians and the whites.  They simply didn't care.  And no one said a bloody thing back to them.  All that being said...here's hoping that Portugal's most famous Cigano, Ricardo Quaresma, goes to Russia and brings back that ugly trophy we call the World Cup.  For√ßa Ricardo!  For√ßa Portugal!",

They were literally made into boogeymen! It's a bit ironic, because my grandmother was a striking and very interesting looking woman.

They say they were slaves in Egypt. Their name \"Rom\"a is the ancient Egyptian word for \"man\". They have been oppressed for as long as anyone can remember. When Babylon conquered ancient Assyria and the Israelites were set free, some probably migrated into India when Medo Persia later conquered Babylon. It was prophesied Israel would settle in the \"Cities of the Medes\". Rajasthan and Punjab were part of the Medo Persian Empire.

It doesn't work. It works to our disadvantage if anything, what a waste of tax money. They take it and sit on their ass, then they steal some more after they spent it on alcohol, drugs etc. instead of trying to forge themselves a better future. Social programs, educational programs, they don't even like to hear about it. Here they don't want to give their kids proper education, because, and I quote: \"We don't raise your kids like you, romanians.\" (I am from Romania). Amazing.\nThey culture is literally that. If that doesn't make you \"subhuman\", I don't know what does. It doesn't take a brilliant mind to understand what is for the best.\nThey should be sent to India or get their own country and let themselves be ruled like themselves if they simply refuse others rule.\n\n(It's nice how it NEEDS to be named like that and get confused with ROMANIA, the country I am from; It's funny how the entirety of the world thinks Romania is the country of gypsies for this reason, unless they are educated, or serbs to understand what is what.)",

They came from Dobrudia, swampy part at the Danube delta that used to work like prison, huge prison for various serious criminals(killers, rapists, kretens,etc.).\nWhen Romania got united the simply released all the Gypsies they had who fled across Eurpe and mixed with the non related local gypsies and that is what completely made them so disabled for assimilation.",

You probably have and never realized because we are in fact very similar to west Europeans. Yes we have a huge tigani community but that's because we are tolerant contrary to popular belief. Despite our tolerance, tigani culture has barely rubbed off on Romanian culture simply because it had little to offer. Hence if one visits Romania one can clearly see a stark contrast between Romanian culture and the culture of the tigani. And why I refuse to use the name romani: they tried to convince Europe that they are descendant of romuls and remus so they gave themselves this name.",

Artists who are ignored by the majority population of your country, play to sell out concert halls abroad. Classical composers toured central & eastern Europe to steal their melodies. As a music Professor I bow too them. \nThe word Tigani, Cigani, Tsiganes etc. all derive from the Byzantine Greek term for \"untouchables\". This is not a term that they called themselves. It is racist & deliberately insulting.  \nTo say that that Romani don't face extreme prejudice in Romania is a joke. Just reading your post is proof. You wont even allow them a culture.",

I'm studying to become a primary education teacher and I really am trying to understand them so I can later teach their kids as I would with any greek kid, but even my professors (who are for education for everyone and are very left wing) sometimes admit that little, close to nothing can be done with them, especially since they rarely let their kids go to school, they usually make them sell stolen stuff on the roads. Child labour on freaking highways.",

He had been all over Eastern Europe back during the late Iron Curtain days. He would talk about the usual stuff Gypsies are known for,but he told us a shocker one day. He said they'd take poppy seeds with a tiny bit of opium in them, they'd take a bunch of them,like a sack full and boil them down to get the opium out and put it in their babies' milk to keep them from crying. He said he's seen children 5-10 years old that could barely speak or talk at all because of that. And the ones that can function somewhat when they grow up,they're the criminals and drug addicts you hear about. He said it leaves them screwed up mentally and physically for life.",

Unless 90% of gypsy culture simply disappears, and they're left with the aesthetic parts, they simply can't continue to live in our societies without being an eternal source of problems.

The French built whole villages for them, and what did they do ? Why are they sending their daughters to prostitute themselves, and chop their boys' hands off, so they can be beggars, when instead they can go to school for free with everything included ? \n\nThis is a normal Gypsy christening in my town, weddings are much bigger and more luxurious, does this look like extreme poverty and social marginalisation to you ? : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZAKJJDNAi0",

We have had our own distinct gypsy group from the Middle ages on who dress in their own way different to the ones who came from Romania and they speak Finnish and their kids go to school etc. But I really feel sorry for the beggars and no one really knows what to do with them. Here it feels shameful because Finland is so progressive and we haven't had begging in decades. Some organizations have given the Romani places to stay with toilets and electricity etc. To me the most important thing would be that the kids would go to school and learn Finnish but also would learn their own culture.",

The historical part of this article was taken from the History of Ancient Territory of Israel and from a small article by S√°ndor Awraham Myths, Hypotheses and Facts / This article is also based on the ancient history of the territory of Israel. I considered it important to describe some of this piece of work, as this rare article accurately describes the historical events concerned.\nHistorical outline Historians and ethnologists who claim that Roma come from India are mistaken because they rely only on unilateral knowledge. Their theory is based only on a linguistic point of view, and does not take into account Roma culture as a whole, which is more important for their identity than their acquired language they agree to. If we agree with this theory, we should consider all American blacks as English. This theory is speculative and not correct. / S√°ndor Awraham / Misinformation about the Indian origin of the Roma largely contributed to the Roma themselves, in order to deny their Jewish origin to invent various false stories about their true origins. But the main guilt in this matter can be attributed to counterfeiters and disinformers of ancient history. There are many Hebrew elements in Romany culture because they come from Israel and not from India and originally are Hebrew Israelites",

        "commentText": "Rem Henshaw In line with irrefutable historical evidence, it is clear that the Roma are Jews of Samaria and are the people of the Northern Israeli Kingdom. Their capital was Samaria in the north of Israel until the years 737 - 720 (BC), when the state of Israel gradually collapsed as a result of the war with the Egyptians and the Assyrians. Until 722 (BC) the Roma were deported from the territory of ancient Israel to the territory of Nineveh, which was located in the kingdom of HANIGALBAT-Mitanni in Mesopotamia. Nineveh was part of the Assyrian Empire in the 7-6th century until it was submerged by the Medie of the Empire, which ran from Anthony to India. King Assyrian Sargon (II.Sarrukin) has joined most of the Medieval places, Meditsky deported to the territory of Assyria and Samaritan Jews, Roma to the Media. The Roma were 150 years of bondage to the Assyrian Empire. After the dissolution of the Assyrian domination, the Babylonians also deported their brothers from the south of the country. They exiled their own identity, the social structure, and their priestly tribes, and then, after the 1970s, they returned to Canaan, where they continued to recognize them as Jews. In a relatively short period of time, they managed to regain a smaller portion of their northern brothers, the Roma, but most of them still had to live in exile. / History of Ancient Territory of Israel /\nThe Roma came to India only in 128 (before Christ), using the White Huns who were Hepthaliti and then lived in the Uttar",

The Roma then escaped before the war to Benares, but they were forced to move to the Ranchee area for the reluctant attitude of the local population. India is not the rulers of the Roma but it was only a temporary refuge in the long history of their persecution. They are not in any genetic family with any people living in India, nor did they have any elements from Hinduism. After leaving India, the Roma came to Europe via Iran, Armenia, and the Bosphorus, adding to them both Indian and Iranian nomads. In addition to their language, the only surviving sign is that the Roma also lived in India with several Skit-Sarmatan traditional expressions they appear in their habits. Abu Nasr Al-Utbi's claim to the origin of the Roma from Kaunadz is based only on the unconfirmed fiction of this irresponsible chronicler / author.\n¬†¬†¬†British colonial police in XIX. century, the Romans invented the nickname \"gypsies\". They also mistakenly called all Indian and Iranian nomads who had nothing in common with the Roma. Later, most of the European research was based on the erroneous assumption that the basis of Roma identity is the nomadic way of life. / S√°ndor Awraham / Only Roma were not nomads, they were persecuted nations for their Jewish faith! It is a big mistake of ignorance of Israel's ancient history of these researchers. They did not provide any evidence of kinship between Indian peoples and Roma! They only supported a false and misguided theory of the Indo-European origin of the Roma. What evidence can be given to such researchers in this context? Here's the whole story",

The subjects of these research could not in any case be Roma, they could be only Indian, possibly Iranian nomads whom they seemed to consider to be Roma based on the arguments of these people about their Roma origin after their identity was lost. I refer to the Ancient History of Israel. On the contrary, when comparing the genetic maps of the Roma and the Jews, carried out in Finland and Argentina, their relatives' intimacy has been repeatedly confirmed. I categorically refuse the theory of the origin of the Roma from the Indian caste of the Impossible Dr. Tomas Kivisild of Cambridge University on the grounds that I firmly believe that Dr. Kisivild can not distinguish Indian nomads from the Roma. He apparently has no knowledge of the fact that in Europe only Roma constitute 25% of the so-called \"Gypsies\". I can declare responsibly that genetic maps could not have come from the Roma when compared to genetic maps of Indian people from any caste.",

Facts .The fake wars on other small poor counties are included when you kill innocent civilians because of money and resources. I have a friend who commuted back and forth to Russia. Prejudice is high among certain ethnic groups. The Slavic I heard gets more respect. The Geogia Mr. are considered the so called whites and they are hated because they are arrogant hateful people.. The Asianatics are considered peasants. The Gypsies are pure theives and know one trust them.Remember it's really isn't about race now it's a deep spiritual war. Peace",

Both the Berbers and the Basque share a RH negative bloodtype which is very rare and some say from an alien planet such as Atlantis was suppose to be?

That's why so many of us converted to Christianity or Catholicism, because the laws and beliefs of the Gypsies that were passed down are in the Torah and Bible. \n\nBefore leaving the house to go to church to baptize a baby, the baby is placed under the table and the godparents walk around the table three times and say ‚ÄúWe take you out a Jew, We bring you back a Catholic‚Äù as they pick the baby up. The phrase ‚ÄúWe took you out a Jew, we brought you back a Catholic‚Äù is said    When you bring the baby home from church after the water baptizing and just like before the baby is placed under the table before this is said. \n\nAccording to the New Testament, the Jews would be required to be baptized in water. The Gentiles (non Jews) would not be baptized in water but by receiving the Holy Spirit because the gentile believe and have faith, while the Jews need signs and miracles in order to believe. \n\nCatholics baptize their babies not because they are all born Jewish but because of original sin. Which makes little sense since Jesus died for all our sins, including Adam which includes Adams original sin.",

They steal everything they can get their hands on and they absolutely don't care what others think of them. My fianc√© works at a hospital and literally 30 of them came in to visit a single person, they stole everything in the toilets (even the adult diapers and tiolet paper) and built up a buffet in the sick person's room. All without even thinking of asking if it was ok.",

Their origin as Hindu dalits is a fantastic tale created during the 18th and 19th century to denigrate Hindu caste system.  However, no one seems to explain how they still remain 'Indian' when they have mixed by culture and marriage with locals.  \n\nLanguage is an interesting tracer, but language could easily have filtered through due to waves of islamic invasions across Asia. Refugees and slaves could easily have created a composite language to cope with their new situation. As they moved on, they took the language with them. eg - Urdu is a composite language developed by the camp followers of the Mughal army. If helped them cope with a platheora of languages spoken by various ethnic groups that made up Mughal army. Yet, we can't say all those who speak Urdu are genetically made up of all those nations.  Or, lets take English - just because people speak English, we can't say they have Briitish blood or that their ancestors originated in UK!",

Now the Roma are disliked for the exact opposite. Here in Greece don't call them Gypsies as it is considered a derogatory term. The PC term is Roma or Tsigani or Athingani. Whatever the term let's put the coexistance of Roma into perspective. You DO NOT want one of their shantytowns next to you unless you like garbage, the constant smell of the toxic smoke of burning plastic from the stolen cables they burn to strip the copper, every piece of metal which isn't bolted to the ground stolen, kids running amongst the cars, begging, insecurity, crime etc etc. They have some short of code amongst themselves but anyone outside their tribe is fair game to be robbed or cheated without any moral constraints. I am ready to accept that there are millions Roma that are wonderful people, millions that are better people than me, but to be honest I have yet to meet any of them.",

So whilst tax payers have to pay rates/taxes, they get to live tax free. They get to enjoy the benefits of a health care system, public transport, education etc etc without contributing. It's basically the same reason why tax payers aren't keen on third world immigration. It cost more money in schools, hospitals, houses etc etc and puts further financial burden on the taxpayer. The travellers don't need houses ofc but they need something else which is also in short supply and that's land. Countries such as the UK have more or less hit their mass capacity with regards to population size. The crime element is just the salt on the wound really. \n\nRegardless on where one stands on this, the bottom line is that if a country has too much of this then it collapses fiscally and then socially.",

Any Gypsy blood in America is extremely rare, and you are not in any way a representation of gypsies.  You're just an extremely typical westerner, who profited from Western culture, and who happens to have Gypsy blood.  Almost certainly highly mixed blood, I would add.  After all, your IQ isn't around room temperature.  Now, if the gypsies had just settled down and assimulated, the way many governments have tried to get them to do, they be doing just fine, and nobody would despise them.  Scams and thievery and animalistic behavior is their choice.",

Your upbringing is probably the Gypsy version of what Irish Americans call being a \"St. Paddy's Day Irishman.\"  You got some blood and some traditions, but that's about it. And by the way, literally everything I said in my first comment is true, down to \"by and large\" Romani culture doesn't exist in America - that phrase actually means \"practically non-existent.\"  All of what I said is based on actual research I did years ago.  I told you the truth because you didn't have the decency to be ashamed of coming from a race of criminals and tried to present yourself as representing them, when you don't.  Better said would have been that you know that they're a blight upon every country they're in, but you are an example of how, when a family leaves that life and settles down, over time they can assimilate, change, and function within their new adopted society, like everybody else.  You're an example of how they can succeed, but you're definitely not an example of why any country should tolerate their traditional lifestyle in Europe, because you're not living it.",

I (Austrian) became soon friends with two of the Romanian workers and noticed that one of them was very careless with her valuables. For instance she put her wallet on the lunch tray and never looked at it. Thus I made it disappear and asked her, if she forgot something, to which she replied with no. I then waved her purse around and said to her that I expected someone from Romania to be a bit more careful... to which she glanced at me angrily and told me that it only happened once to her that someone stole from her and that this was on a train-ride through Austria!\nOn a more serious note, most of these East-Europeans were somewhat hostile towards gypsies and one Romanian got pissed when I assumed that she was Armenian or something similar. I was later told that she was ashamed of her Gypsy heritage. Lastly, no Romanian would call gypsies ever romani, for obvious reasons...",

I meant that it is guaranteed that at least ONE Romani man, woman, or child has set foot on Irish soil in the history of Ireland! And that OF that man, woman, or child, at least ONE of them had children there! You do not need to educate me on gypsy people, not only because I've been studying the romani for years, but because I already KNEW literally everything you have said here! All the same, I am glad that you said it, because there are many people who did not know any of it. \nLearn who is your friend and who is your enemy! \nBy the way, I'm not sure that \"never paying taxes\" belongs in your \"good gypsy\" category or your \"bad gypsy\" category. Part of me admires \"sticking it to the man\" and part of me feels that it is a good idea to pay taxes, because they fund so many things that are good for society in general. \nYou have a good day! :)",

To make is simple enough even for you to understand - Irish and Romany Gypsies speak a common language that isnt English or Irish or Romanian . They speak the language of their host countries  wherever that may be , as I've said already.

Yes the land the original people that once occupied the region from Afghanistan to present India was greatly reduced through invasions and religious persecution. But the most fascinating thing to me is that despite numerous attempts to invade and colonize and pillage India. It has still retained its identity. The ancient Egyptian civilizations have been wiped out and replaced as well as Mesopotamia, the ancient Persians n Zoroastrians as well. Same thing happened with the indigenous people in Africa. Colonizers and invaders almost completely wiped out their ancient practices and ways of life and thinking. Now its western values and ideologies mixed in with the old traditional beliefs...Yes India may have issues  in terms of pollution, overpopulation,  and bad seeds but the US (which I was born and brought up in) has 1/3 of its population on anti depressants and anti anxiety medication.

British rule has had positives and negative impact on India.  Now, how come few thousand British could win India!! For that you have to go back 1 thousand years. Mad men from West of India kept attacking. In early centuries of it, indians must have made error of judgement that these are just another invaders who will assimilate with society like Huns and many central asians but these were religious fanatics.\nIran fell to Arabs in just 20 years after Arabs attacking Iranian and Byzantine lands alike, but after that Hindus of Afghanistan (Zabulistan) fought and holded back Arabs for more than 200 years. It was only when Turks converted to Islam and started pouring in to Afghanistan that Hindus lost Afghanistan. Kabul was gone from Hindu rule just before 1000 AD and ever since Indians were in constant fight and struggle with invading Turks and later Afghans and Mughals, some times surviving by fighting back, sometimes by submission. By the time British came whole indian subcontinent was in utter chaos, though Hindus were resurgent. Hindus were set to win all of India again if British wouldn't have arrived. British won most of the India from Hindus/Sikhs and not Muslims. Society had lost the unity and pride, that's why British could win India with only tens of thousands British soldiers so far from their own country.",

Add a history of forced labor, child seizure for forced adoption (in some cases mixed with more forced labor) and forced sterilization and you can very much understand why roma people might be ware of \"integrating\". When the worse in european societies rise to power, the integrated roma are the first to suffer because no matter how integrated they are, mob mentality allways prey on those perceived different.

        "commentText": "You do know that people can look \"Irish\" but not genetically be entirely that? In fact...even the Irish are not fully Irish. Or Irish at all. Ireland was not originally inhabited until humans came there from the mainland. So virtually all Irish and English are descended from ancient people who came there from somewhere else. \n\nActually, Northern Irish and Scottish people have some pretty surprising genetics in some pockets of the population - some have genetic influence from Africa and Spain or as far away as Finland or even into north Asia. That is because Ireland and the UK are basically the last point of land for a long way, with nothing but ocean to the west of them, and so they became natural collecting places for people migrating from all areas over thousands of years. \n\nPeople on the fringes of the landmass always tend to be the ones where you find more interesting genetic signatures because it is where migrating people went who could go no further due to the water or due to cultural / societal barriers. That's the same reason why you find a lot of people in northeastern Europe who have some east-asian genetic heritage - including my Estonian family - even if they look fully European: northeastern Europe was the last bastion for paganism in Europe, it was more removed from the rest of Europe for a longer period of time, and it was close enough to Asia that people could migrate there over time without having to deal too heavily with the Christians in central and western Europe or the Muslim invasions in the South. Today, Finns, Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians, genetically, on average belong to Y-dna haplogroup N, which is an east-asian haplogroup shared with Mongolians, Chinese, etc, while almost ALL of the rest of Europe shares either haplogroup R1a or R1b as the most common in any given country. R1a is also found in India, and is associated with the rise of middle-eastern farmers who came to Europe thousands of years ago, bringing lighter skin color and farming practices with them (yeah, you heard me - the original hunter-gatherers in Europe were light brown skinned, not pale like modern Europeans). Estonia is another such pocket area where interesting genetic legacies are left: we have the highest percentage of ancient hunter-gatherer DNA and ancient paleo-Siberian asian dna of any living group in all of Europe. Why? Well, it is bounded on two sides by water, and wasn't really much on the maps of western European Christians until they began attempting to thrust their religion on us some 800 years ago. So the genetics are a leftover of ancient groups that came from the European mainland and from north Asia, while in the case of the Romani, they came from south asia and mixed with much of the European population for the past thousand  years. \n\nSo it's not at ALL unlikely to find Romani DNA in people who otherwise look just like other Irish people.\n\nFunny thing is, people seem to fail to realize that the Romani are no longer \"Indian\" - some try to categorize them as \"people of color\" when in point of fact, after a thousand years in Europe, inter=mixing with the populations there, they are an entirely different group and are a EUROPEAN people - a thousand years is indeed long enough for a wholly new ethnicity to be formed. Yes, they are European now, and so calling all Europeans \"white\" doesn't work because it ignores the history of Europe for thousands of years: Europeans are mixed with migrants from elsewhere and always HAVE been. Estonians are the only ones who retain a truly large percentage of the original hunter-gatherer population, and even THAT population was originally much darker skinned than the current population is - we know from skeletal remains and the DNA they contained that the ancient hunter-gatherer population of Europe had black hair, light brown skin and blue eyes. A strange combination, but that is what the true ORIGINAL prehistoric European looked like. A far cry from the sandy-haired, grey-eyed, light-skinned people who live there today but who still carry their genetic legacy more than any other living group. \n\nLikewise, it goes with the Romani descendants. Modern Romani can look for all the world \"just white\" but actually not be.",

Just look at what a shithole Europe was in the 19th century and what every nation except for the EU and North America still is today. What these people lack is education and a normal development that most modern European states went through in the 19th and 20th century. You could also argue that this missing development is the fault of the higher developed cultures, especially the enslavement and genocide of Romani people throughout the second millenium. And the best way to help these people get out of this curculum of crime is to simply integrate them into society. These people aren't naturally dumb. They just need to be educated.",

They practiced the HINDU religion and worshipped the Hindu Goddess Khali. \nTheir language is a mix of Punjabi, Hindi, sanskrit anD Bengali.\nThey were wrongly called Gypsies by europeans when they thought they came from Egypt. The correct word to describe Roma / Gypsy is 'Bhanjara' \n\nThey were forced to leave their motherland INDIA, during the ISLAMIC invasions, making theii way through central asia to Europe. However they have retained many of their PUNJABI features. \n\nAs PUNJAB is in Northern India live in a cooler climate and the land is more fertile, hence they are taller , fairer and more strongly built than south Indians. \n\nPUNJABI Indians were the defenders of INDIANS and are the ONLY people in HISTORY to defeat the Afghans in a war! \n\nIf you look at PUNJABIS today they are still taller, fairer and better built than other Indians including Roma, who have lost some of their Punjabi heritage, due to mixing with other racial groups. However recent DNA testing shows that they still retain majority PUNJABI INDIAN DNA.",

It lays bare brick, 4 stories with tacky shiny roofing with no windows, no heating, no electricity. They then make bonfires inside the fucking home, no joke. hahaha They usually go to Western Europe to scam and come back with lots of money to build that ugly shit.",

We gave them free education (literally free, since their families don't pay taxes) and they stole school property and never showed up again. One county gave them free meal tickets; they sold them and complained to get more. We told police to leave them alone, crime rates went up and they started gang wars. We even have gypsy quotas in almost every university (which gives them discounts  and state welfare) same with highschools and guess what; no one shows up. Year after year they just rip off of what the tax payers are working for. And all that is without mentioning the theft, crime and destruction of public property they do routinely.",

They simply do not want to adapt because the state already gives them so much.\n\nThose are measures implemented by politicians, even against the will of the people. There are almost no gypsy politicians in our country. As far as I am aware, there's 3 seats in the parliament for the gypsy party and the party itself only has like 4 members. As an apropos, the party was made by the self-proclaimed \"king of the gypsies\", whom, of course, lives in a palace full with \"legitimate\"  gold and luxuries that he \"bought\" with his \"money\". \nThe gypsies in our country usually don't register as citizens, which is why we can barely even estimate their numbers. Rest assured though, they live pretty decent lives for non-citizens. While they aren't citizens, their children are registered, only so that their parents can collect welfare money. I've only seen a census of people on welfare from 2010, but it did say that of the people registering for welfare, 40% of them were ethnic gypsies. I can kinda attest to that since both gypsy villages that I've visited usually only have a grocery store and a bar (which of course is usually full).",

I had several (as they are often refered to as) washed gypsies (meaning gypsies that come from self-emancipated families) and they are just like any other citizen. As far as I know, it was never prohibited for gypsies to form a political party and obtain \"representation\". In fact, there are probably hundreds of gypsy politicians in parties that are not self-proclaimed \"gypsy parties\", such as the Social-Democrats or the National-Liberals. Even in The New Right and the Save The Family Union I've seen a few gypsies.\nAs far as opportunities go, the only obstacle they face is their bad reputation, which they make a very good job of reinforcing, not only here, but abroad as well. Even the government stepped in (as I've mentioned in the first post) to help them by giving away free education and free learning materials (such as books, notebooks, backpacks, money, etc.) and they abused the system so much that it became a national joke for about a year (about how they stole school supplies, collected the money and never returned while there are kids in rural areas who have to walk kilometers to schools each day and sit in freezing classrooms). There was also a campaign to give jobs to gypsies, which was abused a lot in the beginning, but now some of them have started showing up to work. Unfortunately, the ones that do want to work mostly qualify as street cleaners.\nThe situation is very complicated, but it's something that they bring upon themselves and they certainly had and still have a lot of options to get out of.",

I just said that the haters are a PART of the problem. The hating goes of course both ways. No doubt that a lot of gypsy parents teach their kids that other different looking people treat them badly and imply that it is rightful for them to steal from them. Just like some parents from other ethnicities tell their kids how gypsies are thieves, lazy and not to be trusted. I know my parents said that to me a couple times when I was a kid. So I grew to be a bit weary of them. Then I realized that all gypsies aren't like that and I shouldn't prejudicate all of them just because what their culture's reputation is. Kids are what  their family teach them to be but the society around them also has an effect. \n\nI am not denying the negative effects the gypsy kids get from their parents. I am just telling that openly hating gypsies makes things worse.\n\nBecause if you grew up in a society where you and your family are hated and prejudicated all the time just because what you look, would you feel like assimilating into that hating culture, going to a school and get a good job with those people if a lot of them where a lot of people were openly hating you for just because what kind of culture you come from.\n\nGypsies are people too. There too are a lot of them who make prejudifications of other cultures just because of some people in those cultures. They most likely see the surrounding people groups as unreasonable haters the same way the other people groups see them as criminals.",

        "commentText": "\" I just said that the haters are a PART of the problem\" Unironic use of \"hater\"...well at least we can be certain you're not an intelligent individual. Also if by part you mean 1% of their problem, you might have a point. If by part you mean any significant impact then you're altogether incorrect.\n\n\"No doubt that a lot of gypsy parents teach their kids that other different looking people treat them badly and imply that it is rightful for them to steal from them.\"\nLet me correct you, a lot of gypsy parents teach their kids that other, different looking people aren't gypsies and therefor it is rightful to steal from them. They don't imply it, they outright instruct their children to steal. Gypsy children who try to walk the path of decent citizens get criticized, ostracized, bullied and abused by their families first and then also their entire community. The only gypsies that get a grip on their lives are the ones that purposefully and willingly chose to remove themselves from gypsy culture and society.\n\n\"Just like some parents from other ethnicities tell their kids how gypsies are thieves, lazy and not to be trusted.\"\nThat's called \"great advice\". Like teaching your daughter not to go down dark alleyways at night or your son not to marry for looks because he'll get burned by a gold digger.\n\n\" Then I realized that all gypsies aren't like that and I shouldn't prejudicate all of them\"\nAnd what exactly changed your mind? Did it, perhaps, have anything to do with your university education?\n\n\"I am just telling that openly hating gypsies makes things worse.\"\nThey engender it towards themselves. I am not given to loving criminals. If they behave like human beings they'll get treated like human beings, regardless of race, creed or culture, but if they behave like vermin it's time to call the exterminator. Gypsy culture is inherently verminous, while there may be no need for gypsies themselves to be eradicated it's clear where their cancerous culture must go - the dustbin of history.\n\n\"Because if you grew up in a society where you and your family are hated and prejudicated all the time just because what you look, would you feel like assimilating into that hating culture\"\nI grew up around Albanians, Albanians grew up around me. Macedonians and Albanians, as a rule, dislike each other and there's a great deal of prejudice and distrust between us(much of it is very much well deserved on both sides but especially the Albanian side). Most of the Macedonian kids on my street hated - and many still hate - Albanians and many - most in fact - of the Albanians in my neighborhood think themselves utterly superior to Macedonians. Yet I - and most of the Macedonian kids and most of the Albanian kids - am a functioning, relatively well integrated, member of society. We are even capable of cooperating and having friendships.\n\nWhy? Because we chose to. Gypsies chose not to. Whether or not you believe society's dislike of your people is warranted or not it is to you, as an individual, to make good of yourself. If you chose to become scum then the plain fact is that you are scum, you've always been scum and you will always be scum and nobody's to blame for it except you. Gypsies have agency, same as the rest of us, they just refuse to use it for anything good.\n\n\" just because what kind of culture you come from\"\nIf you come from a culture of cannibals is it safe for me to assume that you're probably also a cannibal? You wouldn't got to a cannibal island in Oceania and give the natives the benefit of the doubt. So why should the same not be held true of a culture of criminals? Cannibals won't become less cannibal if you pretend they're not and criminals won't become less criminal if you pretend they're law abiding citizens. The only way to make sure criminals stop committing crimes is to punish them such that others will not want to follow in their footsteps.\n\n\"Gypsies are people too.\"\nI used to believe that too, and then I saw a gypsy crippling their own child so they'd get more sympathy out of people while begging.\n\n\"They most likely see the surrounding people groups as unreasonable haters the same way the other people groups see them as criminals.\"\nThe difference being that one of those groups is correct and the other isn't....the correct one is the one that had their TV stolen.",

These people have been in Europe since the Byzantine empire and have been unable to integrate. They're nomadic and thieves, if those words don't describe you, you are only genetically related to them, but culturally you're one of us, study hard and get a good job, perhaps persuade other romanis to leave their lives of theft and settle down and make an honest living like the rest of us.",

They work hard, try to contribute to the community as much as they can instead of being a dead weight. Some of them really try to blend in and do their best to live honorably but there are so few of them. Most of them however don't. They steal, they don't follow even some of the most basic laws and although it happens rarely some times things escalate and even murders occur. That's like 90% of them and more. If it was up to me id order tests to be done. Blood tests. Anyone who has a a higher percent of Thracian or slavic blood or is just willing to be part of our community id be more then willing to allow them to stay. They get pensions and other help in the form of food and money and in return they prove themselves as nothing more than a burden. Like i said most of them don't identify themselves as being part of our community and don't want to be on our lands so why keep em anyway? Force them of sponsor them to go west i mean Merkel clearly wants them right?",

I am truly grateful!\n\n''If your from Eastern Europe''\n\n*you're\n\nWhen are you going to stop embarrassing yourself with juvenile guesswork? I'm going to say never, not until the day you die.\n\n''Eastern Europe is a shit hole in Western Europe''\n\nThat has got to be the most contradicting statement of 2018! HAHAHAHAHA! What kind of a imbecile thinks that Eastern Europe is in Western Europe? It's not like it explicitly mentions the two separate geographical locations, hahaha! Oh how lost you are! Absolutely priceless!!!\n\n*you're - You are truly an idiot, you will never learn, not even the basics.\n\n''so who cares what a hick like you thinks''\n\nSays the child who just openly admitted that ''of course I'm going to be angry''. So, once again, you've embarrassed yourself by completely painting yourself into the corner. What are you going to do now? Claim that you got angry, yet you couldn't care less. That probably makes sense in your tiny brain.\n\n''lol''\n\nKeep up the good work gypsy!",

While at the upper end this produces great innovation, at the lower stratas...it is almost animal-like and uncouth and criminal. Today, in the west...Russians, Albanians, Poles, Czech Romanians etc, are indistinguishable in their criminal behaviour ..from the Romany people. The Romany are just used as a scapegoat by the other mentioned groups.",

Here's the bad news:  I was convinced you were right, so I decided to do a little research, just for my own personal knowledge.  I found you were indeed right about the population of gypsies in Romania being in the 1,000,000+ category.  And I wouldn't doubt that there are more Hungarians there as well, but I didn't look that up.  But, it turns out, the percentage of gypsies in Hungary and Bulgaria is 4% to 10% of the population, but for Romania and Macedonia it can be anywhere from 3% to 13%!!  I live in the U.S. but I'm with you on the whole keep Europe white thing, but I searched multiple sources and they all say different shit!  But quite a few, most in fact, say it's more than 5%.  I'm not sure what's correct, but you do have the largest population of gypsies in Europe, which is all I really thought to begin with.",

        "commentText": "Let me tell you my story about gypsies here in Romania:\n\nI was born in an average size town in Romania (Satu Mare), a town with Romanians, Hungarians, very few Germans and some gypsies. I was both fortunate and unfortunate to witness a communist period, a long transition period to democracy and then the still going process of the Romanian society away from communism. My parents are still working although my mother is retired after 40 years of working and my father is also close to retirement age (he works since he was 16, so for 45 years already).\n\nThe first encounter with gypsies as I remember it was as small child, some gypsies came about once a week or every second week in our neighborhood screaming that they trade new pots for old clothes. This didn't have much effect on me; I rather found it a bit strange.\nThen, as I grew up I started to meet more and more in different occasions. Just around the corner, close to my building, there were some gypsies selling chewing gum from Hungary directly on the street. It was funny for me to see that when a police car came, they pretended they actually are walking in that area. I also had a colleague in school for a year or so. She was put alone in a bench because she had lice. Still, we tried to play along; a colleague brought her food every single day so I can't say she was discriminated in any way.\n\nAs a child, the curiosity makes you think more and more why some people are different and you just ask. I knew that the gypsies are for instance good craftsmen; they were good in working with metal. I asked my father why his company is not hiring gypsies and the answer was surprising. They are not reliable. They don't stay in one place to work every day, they don't respect a schedule so they refuse being hired. Wow!\n\nDuring vacations, I used to go for two weeks every summer to Baia Mare, a nearby town. I saw there an attempt to integrate them. They received apartments in a brand new building. The result: after one week, they burned all the available wood (parquet, doors and windows frames) in the middle of the rooms. I even heard about a horse looking outside a window at the third floor.\n\nThen the communism collapsed (I was 12) and the Romanian society transformed. All at a sudden, new \"businessmen\" appeared: more or less smuggling things over the border, Ukrainians selling things (we called them Russians) in the markets, small shops selling everything from socks to TVs in 10 square meters etc. In this environment the not so legal business started to boom.\n\nI need now to point out some differences between what we (Europeans in general) call \"normal\" values and what the gypsies are doing. \n\n1. Family\nIt is quite common to arrange the marriage of their children at young age. They \"promise\" the children to each other when they are born and by the age of 9 in some cases they actually marry them to each other. This lasts for years and there is nothing really that can be done by authorities.\nAs a consequence, they have children early in life, most of the time more than 4-5 of them. At this rate, they overwhelm the local population. Having children alone is not a problem, but as they don't work (see point 3), WE PAY for their allowance, medical care and so on.\n\nA very important thing for them is to brag and to show off. See the competition for houses, cars or gold. A new \"architectural style\" appeared in Romania in the last years: the \"towered\" palaces. The number of towers shows how important you are. They actually live in a small house, in the back yard but the house must be as big as possible.\n\n2. Education\nIn our society, we are advised and sometimes pushed to go to school, to study, to get a good education in order to have later an \"easier\" life, a good job, good money and so on. This comes along with a commitment to school, to a fixed schedule, homework, competition with colleagues for \"who's the best\" and so on.\nFirst of all, the gypsies are refusing to let their own children in school. A friend of mine's mother is a school teacher. She told me that she had a gipsy girl in her class, but her parents didn't let her to study more than four years, claiming that for a girl, it's enough to be able to read and write. \nThis tells a lot about their mentality. What kind of a job will her able to have later? What will she teach her children?\n\n3. Working\nThe normal expectation from an adult is to have a job, to keep it and to support his/her family with his partner. This comes with social security payments, retirement plan, insurances of all kinds, plan the children development, care about their education and so on.\nThe gypsies, in their vast majority don't work (at least not with a contract). In Romania, they represent 10% or so from the population. I personally know only one (actually half gipsy) that had a good education and works just like any of us. I am able to bet 1000 EUR that more than 80% of the adult gypsies never worked a single day in their life (with a working contract). In the countryside sometimes they work the fields (one day deal with a farmer).\nSo the question comes: if they don't work, how do they earn their living? Some of them have huge houses and yet they are illiterate. How is this possible?\n\nAnd the answer is very interesting.\nThey somehow \"sneak\" along our society. Our very society that condemns me for writing this text.\nStealing, begging networks, human trafficking, cheating are some of their major income sources.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nThey are stealing by any thinkable and unthinkable methods. An example: they put a child in a big bag inside a bus along with the other luggage. The child got out, had plenty of time to search the other bags and upon arrival, he went back in his hiding place.\n\nThere are small communities of gypsies in Romania that live at the edge of villages. Of course, they don't actually own land; they manage to survive by stealing from farmers. From time to time, the farms gather, burn some houses in revenge because they can't stand any more. The result: the farmers are facing charges of discrimination and have to pay money to the gypsies. The next day, the gypsies laughed at them. The victims are now happy that they will actually get money from the sufferings they endure.\n\nThere is one place near Iasi called Podu Iloaiei, where there is a train station. It was quite common that the gypsies storm in the train, rob the passengers and leave. I don't know how it is today, but a few years ago at least it was like this.\n\nLately, they make a living by selling old metals to recycling companies. So they take it from wherever: metal doors from buildings, steal old iron from the very storing area they re-sell it to. But worst, they sold as old metal bombs from WWII, they stole safety equipment from the railroad network and trains derailed because of this causing deaths and huge costs. They got the equivalent of a few EUR and in exchange people died and also made a hundreds of thousands EUR damage.\n\nJust to prove again (if needed) that they actually don't work, imagine that from time to time, one gets sick and goes to the hospital. All his/her relatives go to the hospital and stay there for hours in front, making noise, eating seeds and disturbing everybody around. If you see a big number of gypsies in front of a hospital, you can be sure that one of them is there.\n\nBegging networks.\nDon't be fooled by the poor woman with a child in the tram in Brussels (there I personally saw many beggars). Or the poor old lady at the corner saying she needs money to eat. They never actually worked and never will. YOU WORK FOR THEM. See the houses they built in Romania. Just google \"palate tiganesti romania\" and go to pictures.\nI personally saw deliberately crippled children begging (the worst was on the train Timisoara - Satu Mare, a girl having the knees turned 180 degrees. just horrible).\n\nHuman trafficking\nThis is mainly done by gypsies and the gypsy women are not victims in this case. Read the book \"Zu verkaufen: Mariana, 15 Jahre\" wrote by Ianei Matei on this subject.\n\nCheating\nThe best example is the \"deal\" made by the French authorities to pay some money if the return to Romania. They took the money, returned for a nice vacation paid by the French citizens and then they returned.\n\nThey also claim they can put spells; they can \"un-spell\" a curse from you and so on. They can read the future and they can make anything if you just pay.\n\n\n5. Interacting to the \"other\" society\nAlthough all the other points touched already this point, I would like to emphasize some other aspects. \nWhen it comes to physically interact with them, the things start going bad. If you have a Gipsy family in your neighborhood you'll know what I mean.\nIn Timisoara, there were situations when such a family moved and the other families were \"forced\" to move out and to sell their apartments to other gypsies (at a \"fair\" price, of course). If your neighbors flood your apartment twice a week, have parties daily, ** on your door... you just move out.\n\nI saw once a thing that let me breathless: in the Timisoara city center, 10 meters away from the Opera House, a Gipsy woman pulled a bit her long skirt, spread the legs and pissed from standing position. It's a pedestrian area; it was summer, daylight... UNBELIVEBLE.\n\nA Hungarian TV crew wanted to make a show about a Gipsy village in Romania. They were surrounded and everything in their pockets was taken away. This is also shown on video. Later their local leader asked them to return everything and I believe they did it.\n\nRecently in Craiova a woman was hit by a car. Nothing special, except that all at a sudden some gypsies came up and took everything from poor woman's purse as she was lying on the street. Can you imagine this? It's shown on video.\n\n\nI rest my case here.",

Comparatively Gypsies are meek cos of poverty & being marginalised, so it is ensured they don't have hope to better their community.\nNow in some parts of Rajasthan u do find people or children with colored hair & eyes & m sure if u do dna  test u'd find some European blood there. So what does that make a frigging European? At least gypsies stay within their communities. Europeans sound more like Romas literally.",

Why is this so I would always ask myself ? India is the only non white nation to stand up to an imperial sovereign nation and fight for their independence, the English crown had no choice but to grant them , through Mahatma Ghandi's civil disobedience/refusal to work until independence was granted , caused the British to rethink their future strategy. Once India could not be exploited enslaved and raped the English would destroy their global reputation by negative publicity . India's independence was a slap in the face of white supremacy . You have to understand the relationship between Freemasonry, white supremacy and the uniting of Europe to get my point.",

So the West especially the English along with the US are waging a propaganda war against India, and China and trying to keep both of the powers apart via divide and conquer.

I hereby, just say, that the Romanis if they want, should come back to India, and we'll welcome you. Anyone who faces persecution, troubles or problems, anyone who's seen as a threat or an outlaw...send them to India. Yes, as most of you might say \"haha, you indians have problems...and want more?\", I do not see them as problems....Human lives aren't the problem, it's the situation, centuries of exploitation. I repeat, any individual who expiriences persecution, terror, racism, discrimination or does not find hope or chances to fullfill their dreams, you all are welcome in India. We will not care about your status, your race, your religion, your worldview your skin color or your heritage. If you have dreams, if you want a better life for people alike you, if you want to prosper, but no one gave you a chance... India welcomes you with warm hands, for we are a Land of prosperity in truth, unity in diversity and liberty in justice!",

About the race itself is easier for them to mix with north africans and nord americans since the skin color is allmost the same but they have strong genes, the mixing of elements from parents are  very insolubil in case of crossmixing race, is  hard  with the neo-european race for exemple,  the weird part is that the indian brown race wich they came from can mix evenly with others resulting an even, and omegene cross from the parents ... A lot of them gipsy have  blond hair and strong bleu eyes, remenesance of their migration from the north compared to africans or chinez wich mix evenly from the  parents and, after generations is hard to reconize the origine. For exemole: A afro american is normaly 20% european. How many black americans famillies  give birth to white blond bleu  eyed children ? ... is extremly rare.  They have a strong exclusiv pool gene,  i guess God made them like that for a purpose ü§î, probably to fix famillies like  who have intensiv inerfamilly ties they endup looking the same ...who knows ? Enyways they are the children of God, my whild brothers and sisters ...  can you imagin the Jews where the same 3000 years ago ... they where nomades unwanted slaves for big nations like egypt ... where is egypt now ?",

You need to study more on what 'citizenship' is all about, as seems other choices exist that are a lifestyle or political instead of just biological facts or natural human behaviour.

Most of them live isolated in villages or in ghettos in cities where all the big heads of gypsy mafia make money of drugs and the rest of them salvage copper, steal and shoot heroin. Some of these people fortunately escape this way of life and integrate into greek society but most of them dont. Oh and politicians only remember them when its election time of course.

When they have blue eyes, they say they are Bosnians...no problem make yourself look muslim arab bosnian whatever but then don't beg.

Dark skin was associated to all evils back then, and unfortunately it seems like it didn't change much . The gypsies were mistaken for egyptians whereas they never had anything to do with egypt excepted the fact that some gypsy group would have only crossed egypt to reach europe. And as well their worldview and their language ( which is recognized as of North Indian origin) was deemed as the devil's language by the then bigoted zealots , hence women were immediately judged as satanic witches and burnt along with black cats ; children were marked with an iron in the back so that they would be recognized as gypsies ( zingeur ) by locals ; and the Catholic leaders motivated everyone to harm any gypsy they met even with no reason just for being ethnically different ( to the extent ) using this weird law \" Anyone who comes across a gypsy is allowed to kill off that satanic being lest he brings you his demons \" . Whence the barbaric hatred was passed on from generation to generation. No words for that.",

This is what happened to the original travelers, and with the upsurge of Christianity and the claustrophobic ideas of anything that did not follow this after the crusades they created a devil. That  devil was the Romas an identity of people you cannot trust, thieves and crooks. Pure an simple racism.\nIt was society that passed this identity of these people for years for centuries, and has ingrained this image in society. It is not that they fought for this to try to dislodge this image, it is that they have accepted this.\nI feel sorry for them, as they are a society that has been persecuted, demeaned, and frankly not respected. What would anyone become if they were treated like this historically for doing nothing. People need to look at you true history and realise that although your culture and ideas may be different, and religion, which I do not believe in, we are all one, and we will die and live. We breathe the same air. This was the core thinking of the original travelers and those India. That is what the West could not understand.",

What sane human beings would choose to live outside the law which has tragic consequences for them if other people would accept their being different and not wanting to assimilate. They have that right. It reminds me of slave masters in the United Snakes complaining that their slaves were lazy and stole extra food at every opportunity. Labeling us lazy and thieves is a false stereotype that has stuck to us to this day.

I do not like their lifestyle and behaviour, but I think that they have a very strong bond with their family and I kinda like that part tho... I mean they are all taking care for each other.. the family consists of two parents in their forties, who are living with their three sons ranging from 19 to 24, their three daughters-in-law who are 16, 20 and 22 y/o respectively and furthermore a bunch of grandchildren of whom the eldest is 6. They all have little or no education (the parents can't read or write) and they all got children at a very young age theirselves. Isn't it weird that those people preserve their traditions anno 2018 üôÑ?",

Wonder, if there are Gypsy that wants to brake traditions and go for higher education than high school.  Think this culture is suffering from PTSD. They did say that anyone that broke traditions would be excommunicated by their community. Seems like they are preventing each other from success. Maybe there are Gypsy that are executive, lawyers, and Doctors but they no longer consider themselves Gypsy bc they have been excommunicated. Is good to hear that they are exposing their community to outsiders. But is sad to hear how other government treat them. Like in places like in Romania.",

They used to move all around and then after communist took over Czechoslovakia they could not anymore. They completely lost their identity. For instance when there were Sandokan movies they would name their sons Sandokan, then we got movies about Winnetou so they would name their sons Winnetou and daughters Ribana, some time ago we got popular Turkish soup opera Binbir Gece so we got bunch of little Onurs and Shehrezads running around. Oh and they bang their daughters. Incest is nothing for them. There is one village in Slovakia I can not find a name of it. In 1950 a one Gypsy family moved in. Now there are 1000 of them and they are all related. There was a guy from Canada to do genetic research and he confirmed it.",

        "commentText": "wow, i didnt know about that village. still sad gypsies had lost their identity. I think they deserve better. We had treated them like a scum for centuries, so now, lots of them behave like one. They are hostile to their surrounding, beause the surrounding has always been hostile to them.  I was so sad, when I first visited Romania and saw gypsies there. They are not like these in Slovakia (I am Slovak too, so I can compare), they have still their traditional clothes, horses and stuff, men wear huts and mustache, they play gypsy music on the streets... You can recognize them immediately. \nWe were in Romania with our dog. So everytime me or my husband went to see some monument, while the other one stayed outside with pet and then we got changed. Once, I was waiting for husband and one gypsy woman came to me and told me I am beautiful. I had that big \"gypsy\" fake earrings and  boho skirt. It was still summer and hot, so I like this bohemian-hippie style full of colours. I gave her my earrings, because she really loved them and she almost cried that all white people only shoo her. We were talking little bit then about her life. She was speaking romanian and hungarian (and gypsy I presume). She said they had horses too and some family in Slovakia, Poland and Italy. \nIn that moment, my husband was returning from the museum  and when he saw me with gypsy, he hurried to me asking if she robbed me. He said I need to check my stuff, if nothing¬¥s gone missing. But he was just paranoid. She was very nice woman, was not begging or something, just wanted to make small talk and wished me many children. We were just talking and my husband almost ran towards me horrified like if i was in danger...She didnt understand slovak, but she saw on my husbands face that horrified \"OMG! a gypsy! hold your purse!\" expression, so she left. I was feeling pretty bad for her until the rest of our holiday.  Although, I can count myself as minority too, I had never felt it so. This was the first time in my life, I started to think about what does it really mean to be a minority. When you are there alone and everyone hates you just because of who you are. Even if you dont beg, steal, or bang your sister, you are still hated gypsy. It must be horrible. \nYou know, when some minorities shouts they are endangered and mistreated, usually it is just a propaganda and political bullshits. But gypsies are really mistreated and hated. Did you know that in Romania they were enslaved until 19th century? That time when there was ≈†tur and Sissi and Franz Jospeh...gypsies were slaves without basic human rights. Living and dying in horrible conditions. Their children would be sold, or killed like unwanted kittens or whatever. And no one has ever been punished for this. In Europe...On the borders of that time Austro-Hungary. And no one cared..No one cares now..We had never been taught about this in school. \nI dont know, that trip changed my thinking about gypsies. It is not just a phrase that they are endangered minority. I always thought they are screaming this, because they want more money. But they must just feel all that hatred towards them and that can cause particularly, how do they behave.",

On top of that, they are very loud, treat public areas as their living room and toilet, and often settle their family disputes right on the street to the complete embarrassment of anyone who passes by. \n\nA lot of them have no wish to work, and if they do, they don't pay taxes. Yet a very large percentage of them are on some kind of welfare. Worst of all, some of them still practice the absolutely revolting tradition of maiming their own children so that more people will take pity on them when they are forced to go begging for their parents ‚Äì if they're not just put directly into child prostitution...\n\nTrue, these cultural traits may have evolved through hard times, but it doesn't exactly make them very endearing. In other words, there is a good reason for why they have such a bad reputation. \n\nBecause of this, and because the countries where they come from are already poor, the natives in these countries are in complete despair when the EU gives way more grants directed towards helping Romani than the rest of the population, who are also struggling. Simply put, natives don't want the Roma population to grow, as it will only mean more crime and a heavier tax burden on the rest of the population.\n\nHowever, to not end on a completely depressing note, those of them who do work, are well-respected for their craft, and they often become beacons in both their own villages and beyond. They are still sought after for their proficiency with blacksmithing and brickwork, for instance. More and more of them are also discovering that participating in \"civilised\" life gives them a far better life than if they kept their \"traditional\" lifestyle. Lastly they also have some absolutely fantastic musicians.",

Seems as somebody didn't read it, as i mentioned earlier, you Jews are all in denial of facts. The Elhaik study found evidence regarding the theory, while there is a theory that claims to have disproven it, it was also proven to be inaccurate. \n\nI'd like to point out what this biased study actually says, because what it proves indirectly proves the hypothesis as well. The Behar study found no links between either white people, or those of the former khazar regions and Ashkenazis. Now, it was called out for its biased regarding the Khazar region, cherrypicking very isolated and well-known isolated regions of people with None-Caucasian decent.\n\nSo how did the study prove the Khazar hypothesis right? Well because Ashkenazi Jews has the R1a-M582 Y-chromosomes, which is not find in any native inhabitance of the levante. But is however found in both Kurds, Turks, and Iranians. The regions of Anatolia and Persia having an extensive history of Turkic occupation.",

There are no Khazars today compare their genes to, so what are you blabbering about Ashkenazim having the same genes as Khazars...\n\nAnd despite your fairytales and fancy genetic hypothesis that is based on Jew-hatred as opposed to proven facts, there's no proof whatsoever of the Khazar nation converting. There are no archealogical proofs nor any other kind of proof of that story.  And that's beside the point.

Because Caucasus populations remained relatively isolated in the Caucasus region and because there are no records of Caucasus populations mass-migrating to Eastern and Central Europe prior to the fall of Khazaria (Balanovsky et al. 2011), these findings imply a shared origin for European Jews and Caucasus populations.\"[117]\" -- Same Wikipedia article.",

The Sephardim's migrated from the Middle east through Africa to Spain, some coming with the Berbers. whereas the Ashkenazis has been here since the 10th century, coming from the North East through modern Russia.\n\n>You create facts, in other words, you are a liar.\n\nIt isn't too atypical for a Jew to excuse himself as the honest one, just to call the humble gentile a liar. It's even written in your Talmud that you may lie, why should i believe in your poison?\n\n>making up facts together with your so-called historians\n\nFunny, most of what i'm writting is written on Wikipedia. \n\n> archealogical proof, synagogues , ritual baths and bathouses\n\nAnd how aren't these from the Sephradic Jews? Nobody is saying that it's from the Ashkenazis, who're the one we're arguing about. You're changing subject to suit your narrative, Juden. This so-called \"archealogical proof\" doesn't prove shit.\n\n> books written in the Early ages \n\nThe early ages also write about how Viking had one eye, are you honestly going to believe in that? Anyways, they're mentioning the Sephradic Jews, not the ashkenazis. The Ashkenazi Jews are shrouded in mystery, despite us knowing they're Khazars.\n\n>Yiddish language that was created earlier than the supposed Khazar conversion of their nation of which you provided no proof besides for your babble\n\nSo the Khazars couldn't have been taught the language? How does this disprove anything, this is just further proof if you're asking me.\n\n>I have wasted enough time with a delusional hater like you.

I was looking to hear what characteristics about their culture and belief system that served to keep them both cohesive in their small groups and separated from the main populations. No other group that I know of besides the Jews and the present day Muslim immigrants have these two characteristics. I know these are abstract concepts that are hard to measure and analyze but even the Chinese labor imported to build railroads in the nineteenth century have now completely assimilated into mainstream Americans in a scant 150 years, worthy great success, I might add. What keeps these other groups from melting into the pot?\nAgain, thanks, I'm subscribed right now and I don't know how I haven't discovered you before.",

    "commentText": "Gypsy state cannot be established on earth, because all nations have already claimed the land they want to live in. Maybe they will establish their state on the moon? XD\n\nI mean, unlike the Jews, the Gypsies, don't have their promised land, that used to belong them, that they could come back to. And I am pretty sure that none of them, would choose to live in India, because why would they? They lived in Europe, for a very long time, and India is entirely different culture.\n\nAlthou, there is ONE place that they could occupy, if the Russians, would be thrown out of there : KALININGRAD/KR√ìLEWIEC/KONIGSBERG.\n\nWhy? Because it was never Russian, and Russia took it only after World War II. Thus Russia should be thrown out. But it cannot be given back to the Germans, because it would cause Tensions, between Germany and Poland, like it did since the beggining. It could be of course, settled by Lithuanians and Poles, and split between them, but at the same time, this could allow to create a Gypsy state there... Of course, it would require them to want to settle there.\n\nAnd Gypsies, don't realy want to create one nation IMHO. They want to be free people, that can travel. It's true way of life of the Gypsy. If Gypsy settles, he stops being Gypsy, he becomes part of the nation that he lives in, just with some odd traits.",

They  have special seats in schools,with lower entry requirements and yet most of them view school as a disease. Also another hint of you  never having met .gypsies is that you  call them craftsmen.

If you were actually living in Romania you would know that they  speak Romanian and have no problem understanding others.

Also, enpirical  examples> actual statics. It's a fact that they operate organised crime societies, don't pay taxes and are commonly involved in crimes.

Literally everyone, the world is divided into \"obviously white people\", \"asians\", \"blacks\" and \"gypsies\". That last group includes everyone from all of South America to non-black africans, the Mediterranean, Middle-East, India, and pretty much anyone in Europe with black hair. The problem is that they're completely unable to tell a \"properly european looking\" or a properly integrated Romani person from everyone else, so they only focus on the poor and the delinquents. And since the Roma know what Croats are like, when they have an establishment they do their best to hide the fact that it's run/staffed by gypsies. I've known virulent Roma haters who buy their daily bread and dairy products in a Roma bakery every day, and they had no idea WAS a Roma bakery, because all the counter staff were blond and pale skinned. But if you put Italians on the counter in a bakery, these same folks will think \"it's a gypsy bakery, just look at them\". But every time anyone at all, anywhere on earth, does anything bad, and happens to have even a suntan - \"look at those gypsies, they're all criminals\".",

It's just sad how hatred is so deeply imprinted into societies unable to grow a better generation. And I come from a country far more xenophobic (excluding some of yours of course) than yours. I wish there were a better social education programs out there, teaching how wrong it is to divide and hate people based on the ethnicity, religion or race. (On the other hand most of you are probably in coming of age period, being susceptible to hate speech and propaganda of intolerance, which is only cured by education)",

Gypsies! Turks? Gypsies! Arabs? Gypsies! Jews? Gypsies! Egyptians? Gypsies! Indians? Gypsies! Your cousin who happens to have black hair? GYPSY!\n\nIt's also the main \"explanation\" for anything anyone on the globe who isn't VERY CLEARLY white does. Someone in South America does something? \"What do you expect, they're all gypsies.\" Someone in Serbia does something? \"What do you expect from gypsies?\" Someone in India does something? \"They're gypsies, they don't know any better.\" \n\nThere's rather good reason to believe there wasn't that much Nazi'sm around here as much as conviction that anoyne who looked even vaguely Mediterranean or Asian \"was a Gypsy and thus up to no good\". It's like, it's not that you like or trust blond people, or think much of them, but you're fairly certain that they're not Gypsies so they MIGHT be ok, and everyone else can't be ok because \"they're gypsies\". It's understandable when someone has actual bad experiences with actual gypsies (of which many are perfectly fine and integrated, but some really do live up to the stereotype), but the true extent of the racism towards gypsies becomes clear when you figure out that anyone at all who isn't very clearly white, and this means mostly very obviously slavic, celtic or germanic, is automatically written off as a \"gypsy\".\n\nBtw there are many shops owed and run by gypsies. What they do is that they put blonder, european looking folks on the counters, while they keep folks who look a shade more Mediterranean in the back. The customers generally have no idea that the, say, bakery is actually a gypsy bakery. But if you put, say, Italians on the counters, folks would hesitate to buy there because \"that's a gypsy bakery\". And there's actual trouble getting certain kinds of jobs for people who got nothing with gypsies but are just not slavic, celtic or germanic looking enough for other people in Croatia not to be afraid of them... in a country with the whole of the eastern adriatic coast in it, where a huge number of people look mediterranean. You don't look \"properly white\" enough and folks won't hire you because \"you'll scare off the clientelle.\" They'll hire an actual Romani person, though, provided that person looks a certain way.",

    "commentText": "I explain to you all who are the gypsies. Two months ago my grandma had her two gypsies breaking into her home. She was sleeping, and the two went directly to her bedside table to look for gold. Of course, coming from a family of poor farmers, she is not a wealthy woman herself, yet she is weak and 95 years old, which makes her a wonderful target for these people.\nShe woke up while they were rummaging through her belongings, so she saw the faces of a man and a woman, seeing clearly who they were. In that moment they took a tissue dipped in some chemical agent, stuffed it onto her mouth and nose and knocked her unconscious. She woke up vomiting, with all the few valuables she had taken. The only gold she had were four medals of my deceased grandfather, one he received for surviving Mauthausen concentration camp, one he received when he was a partisan, and two for helping establishing a bank for poor farmers after the war. They even broke her ring finger, trying to rob her of her wedding ring, which she never took in almost seven decades.\nThis all happened in broad daylight, in the countryside near Venice(IT). Of course two gypsy women came each day for two weeks to park their car near the house before that day, chatting with each other, studying the place.\nThe result is a 95 year old woman in hospital for one month for the injuries, crying every day because she had some of the most touching mementos of the man she loved all her life taken away from her, all just because she is weak and those people can't be bothered to work to make money, everybody calling her \"racist\" because she doesn't pledge her everlasting love to them.",

    "commentText": "Listen, I've been squeezing my brain here trying to come up with a good example of a Romanian person who looks like a Romanian...I'll say this, in hopes you know the guy. Sebastian Stan (Winter Soldier/ Bucky) is Romanian. If he looks like a gypsy, then I don't know...clearly it's a lost cause trying to explain to someone the difference if they've already decided on their opinion. My dad also is blond with green eyes, so was my grandpa and they're all Romanians. Or you can be white with brown eyes and hair (like me). That's how all my friends and family look like. A gypsy is dark skinned, black haired in most cases, they have quite obvious Indian features. Most of them you can spot them from a distance. I try to keep an open mind, but really...I think they're a lost cause. We failed to integrate them here, the western/northern countries don't seem to do better either, I honestly don't know what we can do about them. Also, may I add, I've been living in Romania for more than 20 years and I've maybe passed once or twice through a gypsy village.They're not common, yet these pictures are circulating online as if that's how villages in Romania look like. Far from the truth. I spend time at the countryside every summer, it's my favorite place in the world. It's just a normal landscape.",

    "commentText": "Good explanatory video, only a few remarks to add:\n1. I don't hate the Gypsies, I hate when the confusion is made between their new name and Romanians, the people of Romania, the country.\n2. The term Romani (with the accent on the final i, not as you used it in the video) is newly created. It is the political correct version of traditional names used by the rest of the world and themselves to designate Gypsies, Tzigoyner, Tsiganne, Zingaro or whatever people used to call them throughout Europe.\n3. It is the equivalent of \"African American\" or \"Native American\" introduced only decades ago in public vocabulary and later enforced by censors. Except, in real life, I have never met anyone, except the douche bags working in NGOs or politicians, to actually use this PC term. Not even Gypsies themselves use Romani to refer to themselves when talking to foreigners.\n4. It is true, that in their language they do use something that sounds like this. But that is from what I know derived from some Sanskrit word meaning \"human\" and \"us / our nation\". The word is something like \"drom\" and evolved into \"rom\".\n5. The name Romanian (in original, rom√¢n, with the plural ‚Äûrom√¢ni\") on the other hand, referring to the inhabitants of Romania (Rom√¢nia) obviously comes from Rome and the ancient Roman Empire. The place was part of that empire and the language of the country is a Latin language, very much related with Italian, Spanish, French and Portuguese.\n6. Ethnically, the people of Romania and the Gypsies are also distinct. Romanians are white, European (ranging from a Mediterranean aspect with black hair and darker skin to white skin and blond hair, as numerous populations from Slavs to migratory tribes or settlers from distant parts of the empire were added to the mixture), while the Gypsies are of Indian origin (so typically have brownish skin).\n7. Why the Gypsies are also diverse in aspect has another explanation. In time, it became more of a social stigma, a class. So many from the lower ranks of society would join them in the way a young man from a decent family today would become a homeless for various reasons. So you would have European individuals who would become nomadic and live among Gypsies. Or marry with them. Thus the explanation of the few Gypsies with white skin, blue eyes and even blond hair. \n8. As you point it out, in all countries, Gypsies are a slim minority. In Romania, according to official statistics, they make up 2.5% of the population. Indeed, they must be more than that, but not more than 5-10%. Thus, it is unjust to maintain the confusion of Romania as \"the country of the Gypsies\", inaugurated some 20 years ago when the term Romani was adopted by European Union for Gypsies.\n9. It is interesting to note why there are many Gypsies in countries of East Europe. I heard a Gipsy saying this is an indicator of the tolerance of a country. Indeed, they are not an easy neighbor to have so I understand why many may not want them around. So the countries in which they are in small numbers are the ones that persecuted them the most. Thus the most racist, who now point their fingers to East Europe for having too many of them or for not integrating them properly. There is a big difference between Western types of organization and empires and the ones in the East. The Ottoman Empire, the Byzantine and the Tsarist Russian empire were all quite relaxed or incompetent in enforcing a single way of conduct. They could be violent at times, but in general let the societies bellow follow their own ways. Which was not the case with the Habsbourgs or the German administration, that was more rigorous in imposing their rules.",

Which does not come as any surprise. And that they are not identical to Indians, which again is not something unexpected. They've been in Europe for a millennium, and as I point out, they've been a social class for a while, in a way still are. The Hungarians, who originate in Asia, near Caucasus, are not the same now as the tribes of the Huns or as modern people living in Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan maybe. The modern Bulgarians got their name from a Turkic tribe, the Bulgars, but are now obviously Slavic.  And so on for those who emerged from Germans, Goths, Celts, Vikings or whatever.",

Humans are not just breeds of dogs or other animals to be defined in such a simplistic way. Culture is far more important, religion, language, education, personal qualities, upbringing and so on. The problem with the Gypsies is not that they come from outside Europe, is that some of them did not adhere to the European culture and way of life in the last thousand years. If they did, no one would care.\n\nTrying to remake the genealogy of a person based on genes is based too much on speculations. They say that going back a millennium would give a person something like 100.000 ancestors. What difference does it make if one of those is Alexander the Great? Though it would be cool to present yourself as his grand-grand....son. Or, let's say they find out a Persian gene in you. It would make a difference if that comes from a king or his slave, but the gene would not show it. Einstein and the woman who was doing his laundry had probably the same marker of origin. It's like with those who pretend to have lived other lives - they are always Cleopatra, Caesar, never some low life in their stories.\nAnd what would the \"European\" marker indicate? A Bulgarian is not the same as a Portuguese. But many of the peoples of Europe came from Asia. If the Huns came in the 4th century, a Hungarian today would have similar indicators as someone who just moved in the 19th century to UK from Azerbaidjan and mixed with locals. But they are culturally worlds apart.  Many people will say, OK, but it's the overall percentage that matters. Well, they say we have over 90% common genes with some animals, but the small part makes a whole difference.",

It is true, Romanians feel as they have been misrepresented by the deeds of some  of Romani origins and, generally speaking they have a point! However, bad behaviour in other countries have also been perpetrated by native Romanians also.\n  I guess what I am trying to say is good and bad is everywhere in the world, I have seen moronic attitude in many places, liars, thieves, plenty of idiots natives of that land.

So, it seems a whole new accent. They may have been sent to Brazil as a Portuguese policy, which may explain why the Portuguese community is small, unlike Spain's. Gypsy accent in Portugal is very close to the southern Portuguese accent, even if there are gypsies communities in the North, their accent is quite distinct from Northern Portuguese, as they retain southern Portuguese features.\n\nGypsies in Portugal often speak Portuguese, some do speak Calo, but very rare, most of those who do come from Spain, and mix Portuguese-Spanish while speaking with us. Their religion is Christian, but  not  Catholic... some Portuguese gypsies for integration, have done some religious rituals in the streets for Portuguese to see... it is more like an evangelic sect, not Catholic at all. But Christian... yes. The rituals (singing in a cycle) are typically done at a house, choosen by a group of related gypsies.\n\nRomanian gypsies which we now have are very different from portuguese ones in EVERYTHING... culture, looks, dressing and behavior, not the same people, so we consider them Romanians, at most Romanian gypsy (rare), but never just \"gypsy\". Portuguese gypsies are only known as gypsy (cigano), per self identification and also slur, Roma is the capital city of Italy and of the former Roman empire. So it is never used by the gypsies themselves or the Portuguese. Portuguese gypsies work in free fairs (typical ancient fairs in Portugal, most common for them), live off wellfare or shoplifting, in fact, recently a shoftlift went viral, because trhey tend to be aggressive and use their minority issue for protection from the police or store security guards, but not all gypsies do shoplifting.",

    "commentText": "To all those who spill their opinions without knowing the history of my people:\n Yes the name for the country \"Romania\" is from the 19th century due to the fact that the territories inhabited by Romanians where split in 3 and ruled by different empires throughout the ages (Cuman Kingdom, Bulgar Empire (Turkic), Bulgarian Empire (Slavic), Hungarian Kingdom, Ottoman, Habsburg and even Russian Empires), so until then the term was used only for the South as Romanian Land (\"Teara Romanesca\"); modern speech \"Tara Romaneasca\"). \n\n The modern term \"Romanian\" as in the people (\" Roman\" or \"Ruman\") however is a much older term attested in Romanian from the oldest inscriptions in the 15th century and much earlier in Greek and Roman sources as \"those who called themselves Roman but are not from the Roman Empire\" or \"the shepherds of the Romans\". The term \"Ruman\" originates in Transilvania, and was also used in the South and in Moldova (with the term \"Moldovean\" used mostly as a regional designation rather than national identity . The people living in Transilvania,  although formed an absolute majority, did not enjoy any rights and weren't even considered citizens by the German and Magyar ruling class, they were not allowed to live in Towns and were relegated to the farms as serfs. That's why later the term was replaced with \"Roman\" while \"Ruman\" remained in use to mean only serf or bondsman.\n\nIt is worth noting that \"Vlach\" in any form is an exonym only, and was never adopted by the Romanian people to describe themselves. It is not considered derogatory but rather wrong, since the term is Germanic for \"Celt\" or \"neighbor of Germans\", and we've never identified as either one. Today, Vlach instead of Romanian is used only in official data and censuses in countries that have appalling conditions for minority rights recognition such as Serbia and Greece). The Romanian people used the term \"Vlach\" only when dealing with foreigners. While the term or a variation of \"Wallachia\" for the south of Romania was also only used in dealings with foreigners. It is similar to how other people call Greeks \"Greek\" even thought the Greeks call themselves \"Hellenes\".",

I have traveled to many of your 'developed' countries like urs and have witnessed the 'reverted progression' that you are talking about and I can give you many examples as well. You may not notice it now but you will in the near future.

How wonderful it is cities like Paris, Rome, Berlin, etc. I have visited almost all major European cities and have seen things similar to what I had seen in India, with same kinds of crimes, beggars and ghettos etc. I am not comparing it with India, but people are more compassionate in India than these cities. I feel the same compassion to the homeless people in Europe as well, I could call them all the bad names that you have used but I will not, because I consider them human before being an Indian or European or any other race. I don't normally comment on YouTube videos,but the lack of humanity is evident in this thread that compelled me to write something. I don't think all Roma are criminals by nature, some of them may be, but Europeans are also making these criminals by indescriminate hate to Roma and persecuting them for their culture. You called me Hitler but he killed millions of Roma many of the comments agree with him as well so it is obvious who the Nazis are.  I don't even know why I am trying to explain this to you, may be because I consider you human before a arrogant racist westener.",

We will not care about your status, your race, your religion, your worldview your skin color or your heritage. If you have dreams, if you want a better life for people alike you, if you want to prosper, but no one gave you a chance...

    "commentText": "Btw, isn't it a little ironic that Roma usually speak a language of Indo-Aryan origin mixed with the language of whatever country they've ended up in and yet the Nazis who were obsessed with myths about Germanic-Aryan origins of course hated t he \"gypsies\"/Roma? I guess it's because they thought the Roma were nomadic and migrated to \"other people's homelands\" like the Jews and they may have believed the Roma were of Egyptian instead of North Indian/Aryan origin like how people used to believe of the Roma. \n\nThe Nazis also believed oddly enough that the Native Americans were prime Aryans somehow, and some neo-Nazis and/or Himmler had bizarre mythology about aliens visiting the ancient Aryans and them founding the long lost Atlantis. \n\nSome of that bizarre mythology comes from Himmler who tried to find archaeological evidence for his conspiracy theories about Aryan origins and other myths games from post-war Neo-Nazis and the French woman turned Hindu/neo-Nazi Savitri Deva.",

The solution to stopping criminality in the romani population is by educating and giving them a chance in life so that they don't need to go into crime, though that's easierly said than done",

There are all sorts of gypsies, good and bad. Just as there are many Romanians, good and bad. But one thing is for sure they have absolutely nothing in common. Most Romanians are the direct followers of Dacians mixed with a bit of Slavic tribes later from the 7th century. The Gypsies which you describe have came into Europe somewhere in the 17th century from India (where you described their migration well enough). Two totally different cultures. In conclusion, the only thing that's similar is the shape of your deformed head and that of the hospital floor where your mother accidentally dropped you after your mom (dressed as a gypsy) read your future in my hairy balls with her lips.",

This \"Romani\" / \"Roma\" idiocy was invented by western european leftists to erase the name \"gipsy\" supposedly because of its negative connonations as if Gipsies would not litter around their new name. Supposedly it is the name Gipsies use for themselves, yet in reality the name they use is not Roma but Loma. So why didn't they call them Loma? Good old western European racism : they wanted to make the deliberate mix of Romanian people (who have nothing to do with Gipsies) and Gipsies by the confusion of Romanians with \"Roma\" since many Gipsies emigrated to western Europe from Romania. I.e. the whole Roma/Romani naming of Gipsies had a very racist motive behind against the Romanian and in general all Eastern European people.",

The Mongols, Altaic peoples, Siberians = REAL NOMADS, because they have a system and way of life that is nomadic that involves hard work, nomadic pastoral work and surviving hash climates.\n\nGypsies were literally kicked out of every society and city they settled AROUND and IN. They didn't live in the open wilderness, they traveled on official roads built by other peoples and settled either in or around cities where there was a river or irrigation.",

Their children also go from door to door asking for money and when you give them food instead they just say thanks and then throw it a couple of blocks away(hapenned to me once, my mom gave the kid a bag of noodles and found the bag opened on the street half a block from home). Also, there are some who lived near my house some 10 blocks away and they got a 2 floor house filled with 0km cars and they even bought a land next to the house to fill it with more cars. They get rich in the most diminishing ways, living lives of beggars and thieves.\nTHAT's why they are \"discriminated\", not their skin color and race, we've got no problem with native americans here and they look very similar, but they know how to live with dignity.",

The Ancesteral North Indians generally migrated into India from Europe a couple of tens of thousand years ago. They together with the Iranians later formed the Aryan culture \\ civilization. Arya was never a race but a cultural geographic identity. This is if not a fact, at least the most likely story history and science suggest today. And yes its pretty ridiculous of a few europeans coming here and posting comments like 'take your people back India, we don't want them.' If you really consider the country of origin as the actual place of belonging, lets all pack our bags and move to Africa, because thats where all of us came from.  Migration has always been a part of evolution of human societies. Its not always favourable to the hosts. Remember the era of imperialism my european friends, where your honoured fore fathers looted, tortured and raped where ever they went. We didnt want that either.",

I hereby, just say, that the Romanis if they want, should come back to India, and we'll welcome you. Anyone who faces persecution, troubles or problems, anyone who's seen as a threat or an outlaw...send them to India. Yes, as most of you might say \"haha, you indians have problems...and want more?\", I do not see them as problems....Human lives aren't the problem, it's the situation, centuries of exploitation. I repeat, any individual who expiriences persecution, terror, racism, discrimination or does not find hope or chances to fullfill their dreams, you all are welcome in India. We will not care about your status, your race, your religion, your worldview your skin color or your heritage. If you have dreams, if you want a better life for people alike you, if you want to prosper, but no one gave you a chance... India welcomes you with warm hands, for we are a Land of prosperity in truth, unity in diversity and liberty in justice!",

My Dad is General Manager of Northeast Railway Frontier, My mom is a Professor and I was software engineer worked in a software multinational company , Bangalore, currently pursuing Masters in the UK. I have never ever faced any discrimination in my entire life , nor my any siblings. So stop writing nonsense about India if you don't know anything about India. I am pretty sure you are Pakistani trying to be smart here. Stop reading 100 centuries old books. India has changed, we are much more intelligent and hard working Indians than you pakistani.. and i can bet no kids ever faced discrimination at school or office in India. To be honest most children these days in India ain't even aware of which caste they belong to until they come to an age of giving some competitive entrance exam. Because then lower caste gets an extra advantage ..lol . I came to know that i belong to Schedule caste (SC) one of the lower caste when i was preparing for my engineering entrance test. Although I got into engineering through normal entrance test ( Thanks to Comed-k in bangalore) but yeah i knew I had an extra advantage of my caste by then :p \nSo stop writing 200 years old Indian stories here..all this are bullshit, we Indians dont give a shit about all this..Last but not least, you better focus to rebuild your poor pakistan. I feel pity for your country. We Indians planning to send astronauts in Mars and you pakistani are producing terrorist to conquere foreign countries :D haha\nPeace!!",

Because they are very tribal, they live in their own communities, with their own laws. You can separate a few and educate them, but you can't do that with their society as a whole. \n\nJust as a fun fact, they still sell their children in 2018 and practice slavery in countries that are now in the European Union, but politicians and authorities turn a blind eye to that. 12 year old girls being forced to marry, or sent to work as whores because their family has debt, that's a normal thing here. Just a few weeks ago, a 13 year old girl was dragged by her hair from the biggest school in town by her grandfather, because she was about to get married, and her future father in law forbids her to go to school. She lived around the corner from where I live. Now she's been sold and her family has lost the rights to visit her. She won't be able to leave her new house until she gives birth to the first kid.\n\nArticles like this don't even make the news anymore, because they are considered normal : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3154994.stm  \n\nor : https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4972768/Romanian-gypsy-children-become-engaged-aged-six-and-four.html\n\nStreet shootings and clan wars because some guy refused to marry his daughter to another guy : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wh6a1t7ZEE\n\nDrive by shooting because a Gypsy guy bought a house for his daughter, but didn't pay the 20k Euros \"honor tax\" to the local Gypsy leader : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORpmsLoc6Y\n\nNormal Gypsy wedding , fun fact none of those guys have any legal income, or pay any taxes : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq1vGnk0Yg0\n\nAnother \"misunderstanding\"  between clans : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls0mDhEJM-w\n\nLiterally a weaponized child : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHtDuvjEGp4\n\nI can give you examples like this all day. Yes, it's true there are nice Gypsies , I have a few Gypsy friends, and I have dated a Gypsy girl, but they are the exception, they were isolated, kept away from clan life. Most of them can't escape their society.",

My Gr-Grandfather came from ‚Äòthe old country' w/ all his siblings & all but the one who went back to join the military back in the old country; welcomed, integrated with the Eastern European (German) favored culture and thrived as valuable members everywhere they lived until they settled down in the St. Louis area pre-depression. They took up trades, gave years of blood, sweat and tears building homes, sharing benevolently, outliving spouses & babies dying of TB & contributed to their church. Our family pew still bears our strong ethnic name 100+ years later. 1 of my grandfathers cousins became one of the most sincere priests you'd ever meet. The ‚Äòdirty gypsy' side is one that most of the older family don't like to discuss due to the stigma. It's taken a while for us younger family to get back around to honoring and appreciating our roots where it's been due. \nIf you can't intelligently discern ethnic groups, you're going to just look ignorant & judgmental. \nRoma have a lot of hurdles from the get go. It's disparaged humanity that should be addressed, not ethnic groups with flaws as a result of centuries of stigmas and negativity. Not everyone is as lucky as my family. Empathy please.",

    "commentText": "Am too lazy to edit and fix this so i just copy and past it from the comment section that i posted now to long ago.\nThis explains most of the this topic.\n\nI know right. I am laughing my ass off here beyond my pc as both of you the Magyars and what the fuck is Romania it is like the modern state of Ukraine that should not even exist.\nWhere Romania was Bulgaria. Ah fuck i sense this be a fun convo here.\nThe Hungarian girl you're pretty to me and smart but don't forget that we all came to Europe besides the Neanderthals were in Europe first before us Homo sapiens.  (Neanderthals  are not part of our species, not even subspecie.)\nGet back to the point i am trying to make is that we homo sapiens about 200k years ago all came from south africa to the rest of the world.\nSo you are arguing over who is European i get your point well to stay on topic the Romanians just what the fuck is a romanian? Mayars i know Hungary's population but Romanian population well we can look and find out.\nWell what i found out is that the Romanians have nothing to do with Gypysies so okay what is the problem here?  In the Czech Republic they the Gypysies think and say they are Roma as from Romania which they are Not! The Romanains meaning latinized people in that given region and nothing more!\nThe gypysies come from India or where the fuck they come from all i know. Maybe some one tell me where do Gypysies come from?Mars? lol\n\nAlright so Romani people come from India and have nothing to do with Romania which they try to say they have a national state that is Romania which is not true.\nRomani people in Romania. Romani people (Roma in Romani; »öigani in Romanian) in Romania, Gypsy, constitute one of the country's largest minorities. According to the 2011 census, they number 621.573 people or 3% of the total population, being the second ethnic minority in Romania.\n\nSo the Romani ehtnicity has nothing to do with the Romanian People. Good fucking riddaince.\n\nWhere are Romanian people from?\nOne, known as the Daco-Roman continuity theory, posits that they are descendants of Romans and Romanized indigenous peoples living in the Roman Province of Dacia, while the other posits that the Romanians are descendants of Romans and Romanized indigenous populations of the former Roman provinces of Illyria, Moesia, ...\n\nWhat was Romania called before it was Romania?\nAntiquity. Ancient Romania was inhabited by Thracian tribes. The Greeks called them the Getae, the Romans called them Dacians, but they were actually a single Geto-Dacian people.\n\nWhy is it called Romania?\nThe name of Romania (Rom√¢nia) comes from the Romanian Rom√¢n, which is a derivative of the Latin adjective Romanus (Roman). Romanians are a people living in Central and South-Eastern Europe speaking a Romance language.\n\nAre Romanians and Romans the same?\nThe theory of Daco-Roman continuity argues that the Romanians are mainly descended from the Daco-Romans, a people developing through the cohabitation of the native Dacians and the Roman colonists in the province of Dacia Traiana (primarily in present-day Romania) north of the river Danube.\n\nWhat is the ethnic group of Romania?\nAbout 89.4% of the people of Romania are ethnic Romanians, whose language, Romanian, is an Eastern Romance language, descended from Latin with some Bulgarian, Serbian, German, Greek, Hungarian and Turkish borrowings.\n\nSo the Roamanians are not Romans but got Romanized fuck! The Romanians are not Romani People FUck!!!\n\nGeto-Dacian are not romani and it is a misuse of the english language and other languages that is all a stereotype thinking created by simple-minded people who lack the education or were mis lad by the whole Ramani community to whites thinking that Romani ah so Romania. Hahahahhaa no and again no.\nBy the way the reason why the Romani who came from India and who they got words similar is because the Greeks were there and taught them Greek and yes Greek was before Latin as we know it nowdays.\nMaybe that is why the Romani and stop calling them gypsies as that was from Europeans thinking they came from Egypt and just like whites thinking that they were in India but were in Americas and called them the natives indians.

Just read a Wikipedia entry or whatever, its really not too hard to understand. \n\nAgain I'm just saying that the Hungarian language definitely originated and was also formed out of Europe, yet they are Ethnic Europeans nowadays, so are the Finns but I'm not too sure about what happened to the finnish language so I wont talk about it.",

    "commentText": "I was recently a peace corps volunteer in Albania, and one thing I would point out is that in Albanian culture, the Romani sub divide themselves into the \"egyptian\" and \"romani\" groups. At least in the region I was in (Korca), they spoke slightly different dialects and the \"egyptians\" tended to really buy into the egyptian identity. I met many of them sporting egyptian themed jewelry and tattoos, for example. In general, these two groups don't get along, and the \"egyptians\" tended to consider themselves of a higher class than the other romani, and I heard reports of the two groups not getting along even though both were generally discriminated against equally by the dominant (albanian) culture.  *disclamier: I didn't not work directly with either community, and a lot of my information comes from over volunteers who did. I would be fascinated if anybody else has further insight into this - Please feel free to respond to this comment. Thank-you.",

    "commentText": "I need to point out though, Mason, that a direct and unquestionable link between the Irish Travellers and the India-derived Gypsies has yet to be established. Which is of course not easy seeing as they are both groups that are not particularly willing to participate in any sort of genetic research. But from what we now know, the ITs are almost undistinguishable from the indigenous Irish, they are also of predominantly Celtic stock. In fact, just googling their pictures tells you as much: remove the tacky tracksuits and fancy dresses, replace them with some regular clothing of an average middle-class Dublin family and nobody would know any better. It's also important to remember that the ITs have been attested in Ireland as early as the 1300s, which is some 300 years before the India-Gypsy migration to the British Isles.\n\nNow granted, their vocabulary is in some 10% of Romani origin, however the most plausible explanation would be that the India-Gypsies simply assimilated into a greater Celtic IT community and that's the reason for the numerous Romani loanwords in their language.",

    "commentText": "1:27 As a matter of fact, we know for certain it was the Gypsies who antagonized their European hosts first. This is evident in written records: at first the Gypsies were perceived as a colorful minority, they were often invited to play music at weddings and even engage in fortune telling for the blast of it. But when people caught on to the fact that their purses tended to mysteriously disappear after encountering the Gypsies and that trying to confront them about it would usually end in tears, well, that's when the persecution started.\n\nIt's similar to the Jews. They were liked at first, nobody gave a damn abot the fact that they had Jesus killed or anything. It was after they made a name for themselves as shark loans as well as collaborationists (the local Jews were instrumental in the swift Muslim conquest of the erstwhile Christian Levant, North Africa, Iberia and Anatolia) that they began to be hated with a passion by the general populace.",

Only problem is, when an average Christian in Al-Andalus knew one Christian who collaborated with the Muslims, he also knew ten others who did not. With Jews on the other hand, basically all of them were at the very least sympathetic to the Muslims. That's why they were kicked out in 1492. I mean, what were they expecting? That the Christians would be pretending like nothing was the matter?\n\nThe same goes with the Gypsies. They weren't the only group who engaged in stealing. But they were by far the only group who did so overwhelmingly. So they bore the brunt of collective responsibility later down the line.",

Stop believing what your grandmother told you,she is old,but the internet is better equipped with informations about really long time ago truths.\nAND LASTLY,HOW THE FUCK YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME IF GENERAL ANTONESCU KILLED THOUSANDS OF GYPSIES AND ROMANIANS TOO WHO WERE MIXED WITH GYPSIES ?? It's the last bad thing Romania was allowed to do towards gypsies,just like Germany had been put in her place too...You talk like you don't know your worth,that's why you don't impress me.",

Your history is fucked up...then saying romanians mixed with gipsys is fake, clearly you have not lived in Romania to see gipsys dont mix with other people because their own gipsy law demands they mix with gipsys only, romanians on the other hand will allso never mix with gipsys since they see them as \"evil\" people that dont want to work, go to Romania and you will see groups of gipsys with no romanians around...they dont mix not even for a walk.",

I hereby, just say, that the Romanis if they want, should come back to India, and we'll welcome you.

Yes, as most of you might say \"haha, you indians have problems...and want more?\", I do not see them as problems....Human lives aren't the problem, it's the situation, centuries of exploitation. I repeat, any individual who expiriences persecution, terror, racism, discrimination or does not find hope or chances to fullfill their dreams, you all are welcome in India. We will not care about your status, your race, your religion, your worldview your skin color or your heritage. If you have dreams, if you want a better life for people alike you, if you want to prosper, but no one gave you a chance... India welcomes you with warm hands, for we are a Land of prosperity in truth, unity in diversity and liberty in justice!",

    "commentText": "The situation in Bulgaria is basically the same as everywhere on the Balkans but in some aspects it's much worse. In particular, there is a significant number of municipalities in the country where the population has dwindled significantly over the past few decades due to mass emigration and economic decline. The demographical gap created by these negative processes was filled up mainly by RABBITly growing Gypsy communities. Unfortunately, thanks to their breeding habits, they have severely outnumbered the locals in many places. The locals, who are predominantly elderly people, suffer daily from criminal atrocities perpetrated by members of the so-called \"Romani tribe\" - mainly burglaries, which, at times, result in violent beatings of old men and women, who initially refused to let go of their money and other valuables willingly. Moreover, this situation has turned into a never-ending nightmare for the aged inhabitants, since almost none of them have  nearby any younger relatives to rely on, and the number of policemen, assigned to patrol around the villages, is highly insufficient. \n\nSo, tell me, please, how is it possible not to harbour a certain degree of animosity towards the ethnic group in question? By the way, the situation I described is just a small fracture of the whole picture called \"Problems we have with our dark-skinned brethren\".",

And you can't help then to conclude that poverty is a key factor in their criticized lifestyle. But gipsy people are special, similar to the jews, (possibly due to their outcast nature), they have those strong family bonds and a powerful will to keep their traditions unchanged (even the flawed ones). And this is why it is hard to integrate them. Even when you listen to their music, most of the time it's about a nomad life, love, partying, having fun and being maintaining their identities.  .... A key part missing in this video is the fact that for 300 years they lived as slaves, and yet they manage to survive. I see the romani/gypsy people representing the sanguine nature of Europe, together with the latin nations and their ideal place for living could be India, or for the most civilized of them in England (as in snatch).",

Jews were also excluded from the native societies.  But unlike Gypsies , they didn't resort to stealing and prostitution becasue their religion deemed those acts as sin. Jews were also banned to work  in traditional professions like bricklaying, ironworking, blacksmiting, carpentry...in some parts of Europe.  As a result of this, they exceled in trade and became wealthier . In 19th and 20th century, it also caused them to go to universities in high numbers and became lawyer, doctor,architect and engineers. Different societies react differently against discrimination. In the case of Jews,  ƒ±f we leave out the massacres, it worked to their advantage.",

And The ones who are trying to asimilate into western society are the ones who should be refered to as Romani. Is there such a distinction?",

If I had to face such mindless hatred every single day then I would not like the so called \"civilized society\" either. Marginalized for centuries and then suddenly hated for being poor. Wow!!!\n\nThe fortunate have always hated the unfortunate for being unfortunate throughout the history of mankind. But I don't think there was ever such a consensus on murdering their children, hanging them or exterminating them like they are some pest. Shameful. I feel embarrassed that I was unaware of this hideous behaviour.\n\n Punish those who committed crimes, but don't paint an entire ethnic group with such a broad brush. I too think that there is much to be found in the Romani culture, their songs, their festivals, their languages. And All the education, wealth and prosperity are nothing without some character. Peace to you brother and never loose heart. Love from India.",

And the reason really isn't that they are poor(the most of them aren't poor anyway). The reason is their behaviour - stealing, robbing, dealing drugs, provoking conflicts, refusing to work, abusing social benefits... Even when they are shopping the most of them are rude and nasty to the shop assistants without any reason. When someone presents himself as a caveman, then others have a right to think about him he's a caveman.",

But here is a truth I know, or atleast am trying to understand.\n\n\"Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love; this is the eternal rule.\"\n\nThis was what Buddha believed. I have myself hated many people. I have let some of that go. I still hate a lot of things, a lot of people, but every day I struggle to let it go. It sounds impractical at first but after you have tried everything else and failed, you will come back to this only. If hatred could change things, if others could control our lives, none of us would be successful and none of us would be happy. But there are some who are happy which means they have learnt to return hatred with love. If we keep on killing the least favourite people on earth then in the end we will have just one person left. Who knows who that person might be? Certainly not me! So I am less inclined to do away with people just because I don't like them, just because they are an inconvenience to my life. I would rather do something to break the vicious cycle. If I fail I will try again and again and again. Who is more stubborn YOU or YOUR FATE?\n\nOr maybe I am just plain stupid, trying put back some sanity in the life meant to be insane. I honestly don't know. Do you???",

If Gypsies watch their business, then they watch their own business too. Gypsy's behavior won't change even if you show big love to them. On the contrary, typical Gypsy will use you. They are being taught to steal and hate white majority from childhood. To be honest, the hate is much more stronger from Gypsies against white majority. Gypsies are much more hateful when it comes to racial/ethnic idenity. It's Gypsies who should do some steps to improve relations between them and others. White majority already did a lot of steps - for example, Gypsies are getting houses for free, but Gypsies destroy them in a few years, sell all metallic furnishings and then they demand a new house for free, because the old house they already destroyed. If you come with love to them, they just use you and spit into your face.\nI would like to answer to your quote by another qoute:\n\"You can't be angel among devils, otherwise they eat you alive\"",

At the time Asia Minor was part of the Byzantine Empire, but that's what we call them in the West.  The Byzantines considered themselves to be Roman, so the official name of the Byzantine Empire was the Roman Empire. Eventually the Sultanate of Rum seceded from the Seljuk Empire.  As much of their territory was conquered from the Byzantines (or the Romans), they took the name Rum.  The Romani people also took their name fro the Sultanate of Rum.  So in a very indirect way, the Romani are also named after the Romans.",

        "commentText": "Lampavaja Nyasha in fact the Romanian culture is the opposite of the Roma culture  . Eg.  In the past when Roma people were marring the woman didn't need a certain inheritance to marry. Usually in the Indian culture the man has to pay for the wife and take her to his home to live with his family.  Same for Roma people. The Romanian wedding was exactly the opposite, the woman was purchasing the man by using her inheritance.  There is a special name for it. Also Romanians have a novel about a peasant who marries a woman for financial reasons. It is named \"Ion\" by Liviu Rebreanu. One century ago women had to give land , properties or to work if they had no family to marry  ( except if an idiot believed in true love and accepted a poor woman). Usually the woman was the provider of the materials for the building of a house. The man bulids the house using the woman's land and resources such as wood. The woman and the man are working and used to work together\" elbow to elbow \" according to the old newspapers and documents such as foreigners diaries or journals. They left the family.  Usually when a peasant was marring he was sending another peasant with the food cooked by his parents a bottle of the stongest alcoholic beverages  ( named\" Palinka \", a kind of \"Vodka \"but made of fruits) , the peasant had to wear traditional clothes and hold the national flag.  He was riding the horse until he reached the woman 's house. She had to send the same person later with the answer.   Women got more respect, freedom and responsabilities in the past in the Romanian culture . Women had the right to work as tailors or in the literature domain , they were allowed to work in publishing houses , be actresses or singers, work as translators or even doctors before the 2nd world war.  They weren't allowed by society usually to join the army  ( except  for Andreea Zaharia the Soldier from Marasesti) to own big businesses in rural areas.    However in the Romanian culture the woman purchases the man while in Roma people's culture the man purchases the woman. In their culture the woman is promised when she is 12 to marry for financial reasons.  She is sold at a young age by her family.  She has to wake up at 5 o clock cook and wash clothes she is not allowed to travel socially speaking or to study.  In the case of Romanians, to avoid the school was illegal. 4 classes were mandatory starting with 1864. Before 1864 people born in the  working class, few peasants and  all of the noble people used to go to school. Noble people had private teachers. Gypsies had no school. Even nowadays their culture opposes  the Romanian one when it comes to moral values,  philosophy and the activities resulted from the  past experiences. When Muslims attacked Indians they run away to Europe while Romanians struggled fighting. If they were like gypsies Romania had been a part of the Hungarian kingdom or republique nowadays. However the East of Romania was made by Hungarians. The biggest difference is made by peasants who preferred to die poor in the village while gypsies where travelling day by day,  they used to live in tents.",

But what is  the connection between Gypsies and Romanians based on DNA reports?   The point is that I know people who had the opportunity to take a DNA test in USA( the English teacher)  and found out that she  had 30% Roman origins and 60% Slavic origin and 2% Native American  ( unusual I know ) and the rest was Asian  (Mongoloid).  Most of Romanians have Slavic origins in the terms of family names, except in Transylvania where family names have Hungarian origins.",

I come from the state of Punjab in India and we certainly do not buy the girls as you say. You are confusing us with Islamic nations because you are so secluded in your knowledge of the world. In most parts of India the parents of the girls have to pay a dowry which is money, gold, and other resources to the boy upon marriage not the other way around as you are saying. Secondly Indians don't run when an enemy comes to our door step. Alexander the Greats Empire ended on the western front of the Indian subcontinent at the Bias River and there was a reason for that. He knew if he went forth it would be the end of him. Your historians write differently that he was tired of conquering but the fact is he retreated from that land and ran back to where he came from. A man who had conquered the most powerful rule in all of Europe and then further conquered the Persians all the way to the edges of India and runs back from the people you try to call fearful(Indian). We have fought many wars, lost many and won many over the years as all nations have. At a certain point we were the richest nation on the planet and for a long time indeed that was the reason why Alexander and later the British and the rest of Europeans where trying to find their way to us, to loot us. At that time your nations were poor and desolate. Now that your nations have some wealth you seem to question us and who we are with your misinformation. \n\nNow that I have subject of who the Indians are and were I would like to say that the Roma are a tribe and individualistic of India as a whole. India is a vast country and we have people who follow different walks of life like all nations. The Roma are a nomadic people and Im sure there are/were nomadic tribes in Europe as well  so dont defame the nation of India for that. The Jews were also nomadic peoples among other Caucasian tribes as an example. \n\nLastly before you write some bullshit about another peoples go learn a few things about them you dumb whore.",

So, no, they can't be different people. \nAlso in Greece they call Aromanians \"Vlahii ; Mavrovlahii or Cutsovlahii'' , so it's self explanatory. \nIf they where Illyrians then they would have developed a  language breaking away directly from Vulgar Latin rather than Romanian and it would have resembled the Dalmatian language. Also, Aromanian only has negligible Slavic words , so no slavic connection there. Actually, in Romania we say that Aromanian is Romanian without the Slavic words (10% Slavic vocabulary in Romanian (less than 5% in modern speech) and less than 2% in Aromanian). They are the descendants or Romanian shepherds seasonally migrating with their flock throughout the Balkans, most of which eventually abandoned the trade and settled down in other Ottoman-controlled territories in Europe . It's true, though, that phenotypically they resemble more with Greeks than Romanians. \n\nAnother group of people are the Istro-Romanians, they also inhabit ancient-Illyrian lands, now part of Croatia. Their origin is well known, they are farmer-migrants from Banat region of South-West Romania who settled in the Istrian peninsula in 2 waves, the first around 900 A.D. attested by works of Emperor Constantine VII and a second larger wave after the Black Death wiped out many inhabitants of the area in the 1300 A.D. This dialect has many Slavic words in it's vocabulary and is also the farthest-away from modern Romanian, due to it's speakers being isolated from other Romanian speakers throughout the centuries. Due to their much smaller numbers and isolation they have mixed with Slavs profusely and are nowalmost extinct.  It's debatable whether or not it's a dialect or a different language, but both Romanian and Croatian authorities consider it to be a variant of Romanian.",

Probably the English elite will had changed the name for the Gypsies. if that was a problem back then.\n\nYou see, idiots and hateful  scums had no power back then, but internet allowed every idiot to have the same power or even more than a man with Ph D.  \n Also,  Romanians changed no name, just the letter U or √Ç to O. \n So Rum√¢n or R√¢m√¢n becomed Rom√¢n, as in the medieval times(‚ÄùThen why you not use your original mediiaeval name‚Äù)\nHow ironic, I told you, idiots have the honor to spread their empty head ideas everywhere! Take your example, without knowing that, you just blamed us for not using what we use! :)) \nNo, foul, beside reverting to the  medieval version, we did not changed a thing in our name, your problem is with you. You changed the way you call us, from Olah, Olahok to Roman and Romanok!   You can call us Olahok, Rumanok or Romanok, we  not give a cent. Maybe in Serbia and Greece, where they try to assimilate the Romanians and say that Vlahs are another nation, they would give a cent about your  ‚Äùdangerous‚Äù name reverse! :\n\nMy god, what a bunch of deluded fouls, we are guilty because they tried to have better relations with us, and now use our native name, not their name for us.\nGo to school again, maybe next time you get the idea! :)) WTF\nIn conclusion, we did not changed a thing from Caracalla or Trajan, we use the same name, but we reverted to the medieval form of Rom√¢n, not the modern form Rum√¢n, but your elite, with the rise of the nationalism and science wanted to call us  with our name, so you changed the way you call us, from Olahok to Romanok! \nIt's easy, the same applies for all the Slavs and for the Germanic people!  And Vlachs also means Romans or Romance, for example in medieval times in Poland Romanians wore called Wo≈Çosi, and even today Italians are called W≈Çosi!!! \nIt's means the same thing as Romanian or Roman, the native name, the French of Belgium are called Walloons, being Romance.

Picior was picior in all  Romanian, but palatalization in the west was more strong than in the east, maybe because the west was mixed with Illyrians in Dardania and Dacia had tons of Illyrian and Pannonian colonists (we see this to our extinct relatives, the Dalmatians, who  wore Illyrians  and had even more consonants palatalized than us, so  we must conclude that is and Illyrian feature) so picior becomed pt'icior(today Maramuresh), then P dropped in XVII century because of use and t shifted to C or ch(common to Romanian) in Moldova and in Aromanian lands. \nAlso Ar√¢m√¢n is not native name, the native form was R√¢m√¢n.\nSo the statement that  Aromanians are not Romanians can come only from an ignorant of Romanian language and culture. \nSo yes,  at the core, Romanians split in two,  the western branch, who are the heirs of Dardanians and Dacians,  and the east branch,  who are the heirs of Tharcians and Getae.\n And this is not necessary a ethnic split of the natives(because Dacians and Getae  wore one and the same people(in South Danube both wore called Moesians), maximum they spoke different dialects because  Dacians wore Getae influenced by Pannonian dialect of the Illyrian language, and Dardanians wore Tharacians and Dacians influenced by Illyrian language, but is a split because of the spread from west to east of the Latin language who took some time and needed to cross the Carpathians and Haemus and Rila mountains.",

Coz I dont understand why you needed to answering with a freaky disgusting gipsy style way, ( but this is from what your nation well-known :-) ) The problem is you have a huge historical depression, and this is general with the vlachs. So finally the answer is 1521 (this was the only date what I found on your book-long comment, what I have no time to read full). For the reason of this short answer you showed this histerical anger against the non-existing offense, which clearly showing the gigantic level of your frustration, mentally wounded depression.\nBetter to realize, that the reason of this depression are not the hungarians or anybody else, just you yourself. I really sorry you!\n\nMy \"cave\" is sonething what you just dreaming on that balkanic nowhereland,  ugly Bucurest.

Yeah, down on the Balkans the verbal violence is the justification of their \"truth\". But this truth is false perhaps, othewise why it's needed violence?  You killing your argument saying about wiki articles \"fake, false\". Of course, only your falsified history factory could be true in your broken minds! :-) \nMy problem is I dont know what is the object of the debate? In my fisrt comment I suggest you to change the name of your country, if so much annoying for you that many people mixing your country's name with the official name of the gipsy people. Of course this was a bit sarcastic, because you can made any kind of campaign in this theme, this problem will accompaine you for eternally. The only what you can do to handling better your large gipsy minority community, and stoping them to not flood to Western Europe as beggars and thieves, creating bad fame against the whole country. You need time and lot of work to create better image and reputation, and this similarity between the names never be problem more...\nThen your answer was a barbaric rampage, not else. I know this is the normal talk between romanians. But over the rampage you sent some informations about why so important for you, to call yourself \"romanian\". I asked you what is your source and when created.. Rampage again but then you said 1521 - Tara Romanieasca-story.\nSo if I forget the troll language, I learned that you have proof about the existence of the \"romanian\" entity from the early 16th century. I never said you have no reason to call yourself anything what you want, or I never denied that the vlach could be a foreign interpretation of your latin speaking folk. This is why I dont understand what is the object of the debate, except I rejecting and fighting back every type of verbal abuse, but this not part of the core theme, just something what you put on the table with your style...\nMy other question: from where this \"romanian\" name come? What is the source of the word? Of course you have no written prooves earlier than 16th century, but as I know \"aromanians\" name could be a kind of proof for that name, if that illyrian tribes used that earlier, and that tribe theoretically relating with the romanian (linguistically surely)....??",

        "commentText": "+Romberto Agnello \nOh boy, the circle of madness is never ending. There is no shame, no research, only Hungarians, Bulgarians and now you, an Italian talking stupid things. \n\nFirst of all, you had lots of romance languages and former nations inside your borders, so of course for you reality and languages are not important, because your country is made ignoring that, and reverting to a past where Italians wore all Romans, so united.  No problem for me, but is good to see where your bias comes from. \n Italy is more of a concept, is like we would be calling ourselves Dacians(some mad idiots do that and are the laughing stoke of Romanian society)\n\nFor us the language was the driving force, and is the only true base for a nation. Civic nations(like Italy, UK Spain, France are based on borders or utopias and are less strong in terms of unity. Well, France is  strong, having less separatists, almost none, while Spain is on fire).\n Blood nations do not exist, because there are no pure nations, so language is very important. \n\nNow, you are wrong in every aspect, you are dead wrong. \n1. Romanians are almost the only romance people who preserved the name, the only big Romance nation.\n2. Romanians have more or the same cultural ties with Rome than any other former Romans. Some of them: Like eating fat pig like the roman legions on a daily bases,  considering the beard a primitive custom, preserving Saturnalia customs like sacrificing the pigs on 20 Dec, almost the whole Romanian Christmas is  a copy of Saturnalia,  the new year celebration with popular songs remembering Trajan(plowing the field of Dacia), pastoral traditions etc. \n\n3. Romanian Language formed from 28 BC Conquest of Moesia(46 Thrace, 101 South Decebal's Dacia, 106 North of Decebal's Dacia) to 615 when most of the Romance regions wore burned to the ground by Slavs, because of  Pochas being stupid in 605, to  620 when Heraclius changes the language of the Empire to Greek because of this disaster.  \n\n Romanian language is not formed only in Dacia(271-101=170, not 100 years), the language shows clear sings that till VII century she got Latin trends related to the empire. \n\nThis showcasing of the North Romanian dialects is today  a thing because Romania got Independence and the Romanians of Dacia are the only Romans who expanded across the old border of the Roman Empire, after it's collapse! Maramuresh, Bereg, Moldova, Muntenia, Transnistria wore not so much in the Roman Empire, so we are the most potent Romans on our own, in Europe.  Spain, Portugal and France had colonies and empires, but fighting Avars, Slavs, Mongols, Magyars and Turks is one thing, fighting savages with stone arrows is another. :\n\nBut ignoring our history south of Danube is madness. Romanians are the last Romans speaking Latin who wore part of the Empire.  So not 100, not 170, but 648 years of Roman history! More than Milano  and Cisalpine Gaul(the core of modern Italy), who would add only 533 years under the Romans!!!\nEmperors like Galerius, Regalianus,  Justinian wore proto-romanians.  \n\n4. The language was never more Slavic or had  a huge proportion of Slavic. We took French and Italian words in terms of academic Romanian, but before that we took Slavic  words to, in terms of academic Romanian, because of the Slavonic  being Lingua Franka,  just a century before  nationalism. \nWords like drum/road, pod/bridge(we had  and still have ‚Äùcale‚Äù who is a Latin inherited word for road, just is not used by the Government,  we had and still have punte for bridge, well now it means small bridge, and we use the modern Slavic loan ). \nTaking words from Lingua Franka languages is common, now everyone imports from English. \nSlavic words are 14 % of the language,  more that in XX century, 11%. \nIn Republic of Moldova, where the language was more influenced by Slavic languages, only 20% of the rural language is Slavic!\nFrom 20% in the area where Russians practically made a Genocide against Romanians, to more than 50% is a long road and huge madman claim! \n\nBut Vocabulary  is not even important, but the phonetics, grammar and the verbs. In Romanian are 100% Latin.\n In terms of vocabulary, Magyar is more Slavic than the Romanian language is, 20% of the language being Slavic, and is not an Uralic language because only 21 of the vocabulary is Uralic.\n But, of course, what matter is the Uralic grammar!\n Also Farsi has more Arabic vocabulary than Persian, but is an Indo-European language, also English has more romance vocabulary, but is Germanic. \n(Of course some parts of Italy would have more words from Latin, being almost a property of the Vatican for years! While Romanians had to deal with all kind of invaders and hordes.)  \n\nAlso, Romanian is the ONLY romance language who has elements from the classical language and also from the late Empire.  So it shows we are quite the Romans. \nExample of classical imput\nCLASSIC LATIN----------ROMANIAN----------VULGAR LATIN------- \nCasa matris meae-----Casa mamei mele-----casa de matre meae---- \n\nExample of late influence. \nThe term for church in Romanian, and only in Romanian, is bisericƒÉ, from basilica(Basilicas wore a trend in the times of Justinian) \n\n So, in conclusion, you are just a butt hurt Italian, mad that we preserved the name of the Empire and of the nation, or a madman who do not knows a thing but likes to ramble. \nIn the first Romanian preserved writhing, 175 of 190 words, not counting repetition, wore Latin words. \nSo yeah, slavic!",

And you have the guts to say I do not respect you? \nYou want to be respected, act like a man, not a mad man!    You do not respect you!\nAbout gypsies and all this butt hurt Romanians on the page. \n\nMan, I don't give a shit about gypsies and what retarded Europeans view us. Educated Europeans matter, and we do not have problems with them. To care what every bogan of EU thinks  is the act of an insecure kid. \n \n You can call me a gypsy if you want, I am not an insecure kid, my family history in Romania and Hungarian Kingdom is well known, I know who I am. \nAlso, I would not blame only the Gypsies for our poor image, like the fascist Romanians do.  \nAfter Romania was ransacked by USSR to the bone and was subjected to the  1980 collapse, stealing from the state meant surviving.  So maybe Romanian workers in factories did not had the same culture as the ones in the west when they went to work. \nIt's true that Gypsies make a foul out of us, but we had a little contribution too in the '90. \nFrankly, I don't care , I do not visit fascist Hungary or other European countries, my love is USA, Peru and Japan. So for me what you think is equal to 0. The law should be applied for them and that's all!  \n\nYou are quite mad, so I would do you a favor to your brain mental health, and I would avoid this topic. \nAromanian name is not native, they are not Illyrians, I already explained. If you want to debate like a man, read all my posts and write me on Google Hangouts, I would not repeat again. \nI am not very polite if you claim things without reading, I was learned that talking without research is the act of a mad man or a foul, not a real man.

Ah, Europe... \n  You are clearly mad on us , or look mad, because you pull facts out of your brain by guessing, and you accuse us of enormous things, and your tiny little Italian fascism bias sweeps out between words for a trained eye.\n\n I do not call you a fascist, but your culture revolved around the totally deluded idea that Italy=Roman Empire and Romanity! Is like saying Africa=Humanity, while the others are just some poor copies. \nTotally deluded, but I must say I like that Italian fascism was not so bad in terms of liberties and equality!\n\n  You see, it  happens that I know very well Romanian, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Russian and Italian fascism.\n\nSo, mister Agnello, I get you very well, even if you try to back down, or say I over reacted or miss understood! I even get your name, in Maramuresh we say mn'el to  the lamb, from  ag-nel-us. \n\nI just work with the material you provide, if I would see brilliant insight and education, for sure we would talk on a different tone and I would prays the content. I am subscriber to Masaman because he shows that. \nIs not my fault that your comments are so offensive and ignorant in some parts!  \n\nNow let's get to the subject \n\n1. I respect every country, so I cannot be considered a Romanian megalomaniac.  It just happens to see that facts are distorted. So your saying  ‚Äùyou speak Slavic more than Latin‚Äù, when we have more that 600 years of Roman history in our language, and we are the only romance language who preserved classical Latin features and also VI century features of the imperial language,  needs to be contested! \n\nI already explained, Slavic elements in Romanian are at best 20% in Rep. of Moldova(Now. In the vulgar Romanian of R. MD). And maybe in some parts of Bereg and Maramuresh  wore at 30% in the past(XX century, we talk about the vulgar Romanian and is hard to guess,  and  that is an obscene maximum)  because of the assimilation process started by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church United with Rome in XVII century inside Bereg and Maramuresh, from Muncacevo. \nUkrainians wore,  let's say easy to be ruled by Hungarians and Austrians, and wore more privileged in some terms. While Romanians of Maramures and Bereg had a longer history of resistance and wore mostly nobles with lands, and ties to Moldova, so more dangerous. \n\nBut in rest of Romania it's not the same and at best the number of words was between 15% and 9% in any given age.  \n\n2. What  are you speaking about?  When the Romanian Government had a policy to make the language more Romance?  Tell me the law! \nHow to not be insulted when,  without any clue about my nation, you are  talking like a Ph. D graduate? \nIn the last post you said Romanian is a Slavic language, now that our Government had a law to make the language more romance.  Who does that? \n\nWhat is the truth!? \n\nOf course, in the Romanian language entered lots of words starting with XVI century due to large improvements in European life style and culture, as today from English, because our culture stagnated after the Huns,  Avars burned all to the ground, then the Slavs, then the Magyars, then the Mongols, then Turks(try to burn your home down every 5-20 years. See where you will get in terms of culture and wealth, not counting human losses and robbery) \n\nFrom XVI to XVIII century, Slavic loans wore the most common, from XVIII century in Transylvania the elite starts to build the national idea,  nationalism starts to take shape influenced by German thinking, so science and all sorts of writings had a boom! \nAnd of course, being most of them clergy and people from Transylvania, the elites  loaned words from monastic  Latin  used in those days in science and terminology of any kind! \nNote 1: the language of the people did not get the loans by that date in all Romanian lands,  the loans from Slavic continued. \nNote 2: In Transylvania, in this age of progress, the vulgar  language  starts to  be influenced  by Hungarian, so only the language of the elites and the books receive loans from Latin.  Loans from the Hungarian language start to replace or be used side by side with native Latin and Slavic words. Like the word ‚ÄùmƒÉrhaie‚Äù-cow, who comes from the Hungarian word for goods put to sell, side by side with ‚ÄùvacƒÉ‚Äù, the native Latin word from vacca. \n\n Then the idea of nationalism passed into the south and east, to Moldavians, Wallachians and Aromanians, and by then lots of people started to learn in France, learned about the Italian Renaissance and started to travel and study more and more, so a fuck ton of French and Italian, beside Latin words entered in science and the academic language, replacing even Latin original words! Like mental(from french) vs mintal(native), like ochiular (native) vs ocular(from french)!  \n\nFrench and Italian wore languages for study, France was the pinnacle of cultural cool (even German Kings wore keen to spoke in French)!  \nSo accusing the Romanian Government that people liked French, is just stupid, at best. \n For Is like accusing the Romanian state that I spoke to you in English and I say to my device, ‚Äù laptop‚Äù, not some Romanian word like ‚Äùma≈üinƒÉ de calcul, (loans from german and french both) or socotitoare (romanian from a loaned slavic word) or drƒÉcie cu lumini(inherited)‚Äù!  \n Yes, we must conclude, the Romanian government wants to make  our language more English!!! Maybe the Jews!? :)) \n\nThere wore jokes about that in the age,  and even plays, how people prefer French over Romanian! Read about Romanian culture before pulling facts out of your ass!  We have comedy based on that. Search Caragiale!\n\nYes, there was a bias towards Slavs in the late years, due to Relations with Russia, and because we are at base romance, but that was a late thing, not a policy and I don't even know if it had any meaning in terms of language! Maybe that made people to avoid Russian or Slavic languages, and made us feel somehow superior, but how is the Government blamed for this? Even now we are very anti-russian. \n\n3. What the hell is wrong to have Slavic words in Romanian(Hungarians have more, just saying, because I see you received likes from the Nazis of Hungary), and why is wrong to replace them if they are not needed anymore(most wore not are not replaced)? \nAre you a nazi like the Hungarians of Jobbik, and you consider the Slavs inferiors ? \n(By the way, they consider that, while they call the Polish people brothers. Just to see how stupid the neo-nazism  reached.) \nSo, we, having contacts with the Slavs, are somehow inferior?   For fucking sake, of course we have Slavic influences,  and we are Slavs too, we wore fighting them or be friends with them(mostly with the Bulgarians and Ukrainians  we had good ties in some parts of our history) for over 1500 years! \nBut do not means we are not Romans at origin and we are lesser Romans than some, in general.  \nWhen you review the enemies we had, you see how  Romans we are, surviving this mess, even without looking at the culture! \n\nTo conclude \n There are no pure races, and I don't see how being Slavs too, makes us lesser Romans.  At the base of the Romanian culture is the Roman culture and the Latin language! Like every culture, we do not live in caves and we do not inbreed like the Habsburgs  did(because we are still here, unlike them), so we have ties to the cultures of the area! \n\nYou want respect, first ask, then draw conclusions, do not be ignorant and guess your way into the history of others! \nCiao! Nothing personal!",

But the reason is nicely visible in this article:\n\nhttps://www.romania-insider.com/why-romanians-hate-romania/\n\nSo not hate yourself, even not on undermind way - and the world will slowly starting to accept you. But the world cant accept else, just who you are in the reality, they not interested about the fake theories, self lies, personal escaping routes. All the best to find the way....\"\n\nIf you answering for this type of comments on that way as you does, you are an imbecil handicaped asshole, a typical balkanic zeromind, fascist-socialist together (very well working in balkanic Rumunia), so you are simply dead.\nI really sorry your enviroment, coz I know smart and well-prepared romanians, who have some common with Europe, but sorry you are not like that. \nWell I understand hurting your fairytale castle if someonrpe telling you the truth, that YOU HAVE NO CONNECTION with the Roman Empire, or Rome directly. No scientists in the world accepting that idiot theory, that Dacians survived 800 years without archeologial founds, without any mentioning in the contemporary texts, as hidden folks in the caves\" :D :D This is the stupidest, most ridiculous idea  in the universe. Wallachians was latinized illyrians, lived south of the Balkans on the present territory of Albania, Dalmatia. Few of their groups with time picked up the language of the surrounding folks, this was the only relation with the ruler Roman Empire, who enslaved them. Funny and nowhere else could happening, only on the Balkans, that an enslaved folks want to naming itself for those who enslaved them :D :D :D\nOke stupid vlach asshole, lets dream forward in your falsified bubble, nobody care about you... :D",

I didn't say that you're not Romans even if I don't think so\n3. I don't think that you can find a perfect roman discendent because of the invasion all over europe and I don't consider myself as an historical Roman even if I'm from Rome\n4. You're wrong if you consider yourself Roman (see point two)\n5. I even speak Romanian so I'm not that ignorant\n6. Stop it. You keep continue to accuse people. I think you have some sort of inferiority complex or probably you've been in Italy and they didn't treat you well.\n7. I don't know why you talk about Fascism but. \n8. Did I say something about slavs? I just said that a language doesn't indicate a culture totally. Before you had more slavic words (this is a fact). You even got German words and Greek words that doesn't mean you're german (even if there are a lot of germans in Romania). Personally I know a lot of Romanians here in Italy (there are 2 millions of Romanians) and they all hate Hungarians even if they're in part. I mean Transilvania was Hungarian 100 years ago. \nNothing personal to me too. You're just guessing things that I don' t said. By the way my surname is correct.

        "commentText": "+Roberto Agnello  Well, if you insist, i should respond!  \nIs not the same thing, and probably for you is not a big deal to talk about invented languages and conspiracies, but some Hungarian nuts, Bulgarian nuts,  Russian nuts and Romanian nuts might believe you. \nYou see, in the middle of Europe, not Mediterana, this concepts killed tens of millions. (Still kill in Donets and Lugansk)  \n\nYou clearly do not read my texts, I do not visit Europe, I will not visit Italy, and I consider Romanians, who say we are not guilty in part for how people see us, as unrealistic. \n\nRomanians had and have more bad morals than most of EU, have a complex culture, but inferior in terms of philosophy, in comparison to USA and UK,  due to clear factors.  \nThe texts are above. \nSorry, you have one problem with your ‚Äùyou are mad for nothing‚Äù, the texts are there. \nQuote\n‚ÄùFor example Romanian has been latinized about 100 years a go. It was a mixture between slavic and romance language (more slavic)‚Äù\n It's black on white, Romanian is an artificial language who was more Slavic than Latin in the past! You said that! Is there. \n\nThen you said that the Government had something to do with it, of course!  So that is history revisionism. You know, like ‚ÄûUkraine is an artificial fascist nation, who stole her lands from Russia, Hungary, Poland and Romania, so let's bring 'democracy' with green mercenaries and covert missions and conquer Ukraine‚Äù \n So my posts are on point! \n\nFor your Romanian culture,  the only policy in this mater was the national-socialist policy in the times of Ceau≈üescu, who was totally against Rome!  I bet all the bogans from Romania will tell you they are Dacians and Latin was some fake Dacian!  Just visit any pub and ask! :)) \n\nAnd just one problem, the Slav words are in the same number, just they have a smaller proportion, they are in DEX all of them, so they are counted.  \n\nBy the way, I do not see myself as a roman in terms of blood and politics, because Rome is dead and there was no pure blooded Rome, to begin, but in terms of culture I am a roman by extent, I like it, or not!   \n\nWhy? Simple, because Rome was never about blood, in most cases, because Rome formed a nation and was the only nation till 1848, because I know for sure that the language we have  is there because we wore part of the nation, and  most of the Roman lands still speak Latin in an evolved stage, some who did not had Empires and Medieval states favorable, still preserve the name(we, the ones from the Alps, the Greeks).  \n\nIt matters less if my Ancestors wore Slavic warlords or Cuman mercenaries, or Roman Consuls, or Dacian sicari, because culture has nothing to do with the blood, and they already decided to adopt the culture I have, who is Roman at the base! Who am I to take a DNA test and then to say, wait, I am more ‚ÄùCeltic‚Äù because I have R1b, so I am French! :)) Has no sense! \nSo from this aspect,  I am Romanian and by extent Roman.  This is the whole point of the Romanians feeling Romans.  It's not like we have some Make Romania Empire Great again movement, like the panslavic one!  I think this was the point of  Romanity to begin with. \n\nSo that will be the answer. \n\nYou don't know the area and what your words had provoked in this savage corner of Europe.  In Italy even the fascism looked like a good Russian democracy! :))\n-------- Hungarians?\nWe wore by our will  just part of the Kingdom of Hungary, that died with the Arpad line, and at Mohacs , It's remains wore just a ghost on a map, transformed and warped by leaders from Poland, Germany , Transylvania and the Catholic Church in something who collapsed step by step! \n\n So I do not  know  why I would consider myself Hungarian.  \nIn the Kingdom of Hungary, my ancestors wore called Olahi, not Hungarians. Quotte ‚ÄûIohannes filius Ige voyvoda Olacorum de Maramoros‚Äù  Ige=Iuga, olacorum=romanian, voyvoda= military leader and duke, even prince(Domn) in our culture (This is from a XIV century Hungarian diploma, as Maramuresh was a vassal political entity inside the Kingdom untill XV century) \n\nThen the Hungarian nation formed  influenced by Transylvanian feudalism and religious infighting between Rome and Constantinople, so that was the end of the somehow multicultural Magyar Kaghanate of Arpad, the end of my people noble rights and the start of reverting to dark age, famine, isolation and savageness(Well, in Transylvania started earlier, but in Maramuresh after 1848). Then all this transformed in civil wars. So it has no sense at all for me to consider myself Hungarian, we never formed a nation, and the forming of their nation was not happy for us. \n\nThe last war my ancestors fought for the ‚Äùde facto‚Äù Kingdom of Hungary, by will , was against the Austrians,  with R√°k√≥czi. But that just fucked up Maramuresh, all the churches and most of the homes wore burned by Ukrainians serfs paid by Austria, while fighting in other areas. And  from that point Romanians will be the bad guys and a minority with the time in Maramuresh!  (Now some fascist from Hungary even accuse us that our churches are not older than XVIII century. ) \n\nBut I respect Hungarians, most of them who I know in real life I consider my friends.",

Emperors like Galerius, Justinian wore what  we will now call as a  proto-romanians.\n In the times of Maurice we have the first record of proto-Romanian language, or Vulgar Latin of the East, in his army around Dobrudja. \nProto-Romanians wore not used in the auxiliary troops since that was reserved for allies, not for Romans, after 210, and before that for peregrini(free people, non citizens of the empire, who wore not Romans by the law ).\nSo you should be mad, but mad on your stupidity  to talk without a clue. \nI think you watch to much British, Russian and US state funded propaganda about the Romans(as some perfect allies who went missing, while the all mighty Russians, Saxons, and the Saxon rebels from America made their culture endure). No that is just bullshit, Romans never went extinct. \n\nThis chant is composed by a proto-Romanian of Aiadava(DacianMoesian name) or Remesiana(Roman name), by the name Nichetas. \nHe made huge efforts to convert all the Danube basin to the faith. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqwV9l-U8ds",

Their Language and Culture is even simmiliar. They are more Roman than the Germanic \"Italians\", who are actualy mostly descendants of the Lombards, because true romans in Rome were killed by dieseases, earthquakes catastrophes, and Invasions, as well as Wars, which they waged before all those bad things happened. Goths, when they invaded rome, destroyed the city, and killed many of the people in it. And they were Germanics too.\n\nSame thing, happened to Greece, Except, it was Slavs, not Germans(Well Goths invaded greece too, before the slavs...), that mainly did the job, of creating the current Greeks. And the Turks.\n\nBut Romania is a melting pot too, just, their roots, are actualy more romans, than the rest of the world.\n\nHowever, take what I said with grain of salt : Things are actualy much more complicated, and I'm just simplifying it here.",

Don't respond to such trolls please, his comments are not only trollish, but also inflammatory and racist. If you see such people, please, don't respond, just flag them, srlsly don't let such morons spread their racist propaganda.\n\nIt's okay to be controversial. It's not okay, to discriminate people based on their ethnicity, birth, social standing or class. That is what Communist, National Socialists, Fascists, and other Marxist Ideologies do : They put people in boxes of \"Is human because X\" and \"Is not human because Y\"\n\nIf someone says thing like \" You are not human/You need to be killed because you are member of nobility/gypsies/jews/males/females/etc. \" it means you're facing a hatemonger, who is propably also marxist, even if he does not realize he is. Or have Ideology that resembles marxist, but thought it up himself, assuming he didn't read marx at all. I mean - People can have simmiliar ideas, but not derive them from one eachother.\n\nSo keep in mind, you should allways flag those people. I know free speech is all nice, but if people use free speach to spread hate between us, it is against the law, and is not free speech but hatemongering",

Romania and Transylvania plateau, in particular, links North Europe to South-East Europe, Danube Basin and Italy to East Europe. \n\nAlso, two main paths, out of three classical paths of migration in Europe(Gibraltar Straits;  Bosfor-Danube Valley; North Black Sea plains-Transylvanian Plateau-Tisa Plain)  cross near or right  trough  the center of our country.",

Many of us are between 25% and 75% \"White European,\" and this all goes back about approximately 800 years of our 1,200 years in Europe. That being said, I would love for you to try to tell a Romanichal, Welsh Kale or Finnish Kale person that they're not White. (They are literally as White looking and genetically European as what every passes for White in the minds' of today's racists, as they tend to be over 75% White.) Also, we were raped and enslaved in what is now modern day Romania by Romanians (see Vlach Roma of Transylvania) and many of us share common Romanian ancestries. And, as you apparently do not know, our name means \"husbands/men/people\". It is pure coincidence that our Hindi-derived name resembles the name of those who made us distinctly European in the first place. In regard to your whole Hungarians hating Romanians-thing, that's because Europeans of all shapes, colors and sizes, including Hungarians, hate Romania and is people. (Everyone from politicians to athletes unfortunately hate Romanians.) Lastly, Romanian Roma are as Romanian as any other \"non-traditional\" Romanian subgroups; e.g., Jews, Turks, Germans (Rum√§niendeutsche), Italians, Greeks, etc. so please be careful with who you try to deem \"Romanian\" and \"not Romanian\".",

Austria-Hungary had a large Romani/gipsy population, but many of the new nations refused to grant citizenship to the Romani and expulsed them. Romania was an exception, Romani were granted Romanian citizenship and thus many of them from other parts of the former Austria-Hungary migrated there. This is a major reason why Romania has now one of the largest Romani populations in Europe, and the resulting confusion. A good deed never goes unpunished.",

So we started at the worst conditions imaginable, being also forced to let other countries take hold of the little natural resources we have, and yet the western part strived, becoming at one point the biggest exporteur world wide, while our eastern part had a head start and was doing better in the early years, but later failed and collapsed like all communist countries. Today we are still the third biggest exporteur world wide, but due to the burden of reunification, we didn't have nearly the growth, nor any rising real payment since 1990, plus we had/ have to put billions into rebuilding and modernizing, while also facing the problem of all the young people leaving the east, while the rest has problems finding work and as a society with a disproportional amount of radical political trouble (extreme amount of neo nazis and left wing extremists compared to the rest). As eastern germany had the benefit of having a rich country to reunify with after the collapse of the soviets, the aftermath might not be as apparent as in other former east block countries, yet it still demonstrates in my oppinion, that the 45 years of communism had way more influence on todays prosperity of its former countries, than the centuries prior.",

So, you are doing an imitation of who the dravidians are, and where their basic origins come from, then you will see why the roma  people call themselves '' roma '', because that name is an entomology originating in India and designating an avatar, such as Egiptyan, Ra, or that of the ancient Indians, Ram, or Rama. So, this denomination, rom, does not come from the latin, but was taken from their etruscan ancestors, who were of dravidian origin. I know it seems to be impossible to believe, but the historical paintings and archaeologists in Italy and other areas also proves linguistically and historically that the etruscans were dravidian. Not as the Italian historians did not know who their ancestors were, but the europeans did not admit that the common ancestor of man would be the African.",

As to the diligence of the majority Romanians, the shameful history of Romania contradicts, because the collective Romania is clearly a form of economic and social exploitation. You know what the saying goes: if the work was good, the boyars would take it. So, all the historians know that the majority Romanians are a thief, a traitor, and a murderer and a bitch, even when they used to talk and call the Wallachian.",

So the racists also invented Aryan theory, because they do not admit that their ancestors come from Africa! Although, migration is recognized and adopted by most DNA scientists, the Dacians were Scythians (Iranians). Thrace, was the name of all Thracian citizens of whatever origin. Always the Indians beat the face of the Iranians that they were one and the same when they lived on the Indus Valley, the Iranians beat their face to the Turks reminding them that you forgot that they were descending from the Iranians, and so the Bulgarian, Bulgarians, omit that they were drawn from the Turks . But the so-called Indo-European peoples are actually those from Asia. I always beat the face of the Greeks coming from Asia, the island of Lidia and Crete, always knocking the cheeks of the so-called Italians whose ancestors were Etruscan Dravidian. As for the Dacians and the so-called Latino Italians, although the Latins were those in the Latium area (today Lazio), they forget that Latins are now in the present, and the Slavs are from the sixth century, as do the Iranian Dacians . This explains why the Romanian and Italian historians did not want to reveal the truth about such mysterious Dacian and Etruscan figures, because they were ashamed to be a nation",

I bet that at the times of history in Europe it was mentioned that the numerical system was invented by the Arabs and that they were called Arabic figures. But the merit belongs to the Indians and is called Indian art. I do not miss the theory of European racists with the Aryans who invaded India and their faces civilized, because Muller's theory is nothing else but to support the superiority of the European race to the negroid. But these are false theories that only prove to be rabid idiots with sham ideologies. But, as a matter of fact, the Islamic people do not confuse the tradition of the Indians when they engage or marry the \"bikindel\" (buy / sell the body), with pokindel (to buy the girl's dowry, the sacredness and purity of the face). Muslims no longer commit misdemeanors by marrying second-degree relatives! To see their stall that they know nothing about Indians or Roma!",

    "commentText": "In Florence when someone begs for money in the streets for years without ever learning decent Italian, without looking for any job and while wearing clothes that look tipical of a different ethnic group it's very easy for that person to be seen as a \"zingaro\", which is a bit like gipsy but a bit more offensive. I don't even know if those beggars are really of any ethnicity different than mine to be fair. There are many actual gipsies (I think the majority) that live super normal lives, look for jobs, work, send their children to school and things like that but I guess that nobody cares about them, ok these integrated and normal people are the majority of gipsies but why should I care, they're simply my fellow Italians and normal people and there's nothing strange about that. What is interesting is that I saw some black immigrants come, learn Italian, settle down, meanwhile some gipsies (the minority of them) continue to be nomadic, make everything dirty and sometimes harrass people for money (this is not a serious issue though)",

Everyone appears to agree that they are thieving, workshy, lowlifes, but is that because of their inherent nature or because, due to discrimination, there is no other way for them to live? I am not trying to make excuses for criminality but if¬†people are shunned and excluded from mainstream society it is¬†not surprising that they would adopt an anti social lifestyle. If they have no other choice it is hardly rocket science to see how they would embrace criminality as everyone has to survive somehow. Included in this video was a passing comment regarding Irish Travellers. I am not an expert but despite having superficially similar lifestyles I do not think that they are related to the Roma, either racially or culturally. If anyone knows differently, please inform me that I am wrong.",

That being said, we are actually not \"Indian\". We left India 1,500 years ago, and even though we usually possess 25% to 75% South Asian heritage, we are a distinctly European peoples. (I use \"peoples\" because we are comprised of numerous sub-groups and each group has varying degrees of Whiteness and Brownness. Calling us Indian is like calling a Sephardic person only Middle Eastern & North African, instead of mixed Spanish and pre-European Jewish. At the end of the day, the Sephardi are distinctly European, whilst still being of non-White Jewish heritage, but are usually seen as White and European because of their considerable Iberian heritage. We too, are arguably White and are never 90% Indian the same way that African-Americans can be 90+% Sub-Saharan African. Like, you don't have to be bi-racial or have had a White slave master ancestor to be African-American and conversely, you don't have to even be the descendant of an American slave (e.g., Haitian, Brazilian, Puerto Rica, etc.) to be Black, and even some cases African-American. If you're Black, you're still Black and aren't entirely separate from your pre-slavery ancestors. Also, calling us Indian would mean that all Desi people living in Europe and facing discrimination would also be considered Romani, which just isn't the case. A man from Punjab who immigrates to Hungary and has a child with a Magyar women wouldn't produce a Roma child. Still, I appreciate your analogy.",

    "commentText": "Europeans have for hundreds of years harassed the Romani and denied them equal positions in our society, and then after treating them like that for some centuries we blame them for the non-integration we forced on them(just scroll through all the negative comments here and see for yourself).\n\nYet I have several Romani descendant friends who've had to tell me of their origin before I knew, they were as integrated and Norwegian as anyone else. The old Romani population here is more or less completely integrated by now, it's the never arrivals from Russia the past century, and now in later years from Balkan, which are not.\n\nAnd seeing that they can do, and does do, well in Latin America, it's obvious to me it's the treatment they have received that is the cause of their problems, and not the other way around. If you treat someone as shit for years and years, guess what will happen to them. You try doing that to anyone and the result will be pretty sad, try it on your own child of you want to test it out, all humans are results of our surroundings.\n\nTaken for example African American. The crime rate among African American is higher than any African country, with the exception of Lesotho, Namibia and South Africa(which by the way is probably the three countries where the colonial rule and Apartheid had the most oppressing results). So obviously it's the treatment of African American which is the cause of their high crime rate, and not genetics. This is as evident as it gets. And the same goes with the Romani.\n\nIt's the people who write hateful comments here about the Romani, which is exactly the cause for the problems from the Romani. These haters are in essence shitting on their own legs, in a wider context. What a bunch of fucking idiots.\n\nPlease think about that the next time you decide to stigmatize and spread hate towards a group of people. You are making the world a worse place, in a direct way. Racist people are fucking cancer to society.",

I've already said they have integrated well in a lot of places, like here in Scandinavia, and across the pond as well. So if your whole \"they refuse to integrate\" argument is to work, you need to explain why they chose to integrate other places. My hypothesis is the chances they were given. You cannot blame people for not taking chances they were never really given.\n\nThe place in Europe where they are the least integrated is in Eastern Europe, which also happens to be the most racist place of all of Europe. You think that's a coincidence?\n\nIf you have a different claim you have to explain what that claim is, and why it is so, not just come with the simplistic \"they refuse to integrate!\" utterance. \n\n\" And you think all that is happening because some generations ago, they were oppressed?\"\n\nIt takes more that a couple of generation to change a culture. It's a long process. And the way to start it, is _not _to say stuff like what has been said in this comment section.\n\n\"They're not the only minority that suffered oppresion in the past. For example, during WW2, jews had the same treatment, maybe even worse, yet they managed to integrate.\"\n\nThe Jews integrated more or less long before WW2. They were in the core of European culture for centuries, producing so many of our scientists, philosophers, inventors, capitalists etc. Now they've all either been slaughtered, or moved to Israel and America - and we've lost unthinkable potential in the European Ashkenazim Jews(which have an average IQ of about 110-115, the only ethnic group more intelligent than East Asians) - our oppression made them move out of here; it's is not the greatest example of integration now is it?\n\nI think the Sami is a better comparison, given that they are also traditionally a nomadic people, and that they were living pretty simple lives(well, not the Sea Samis, but the Mountain Samis) just a hundred or so years ago. The Samis have kept their identity, their language(somewhat), their reindeer herds, but yet are still functioning members in society, educated and participating. They were given a chance. Not even a fair chance, they've been given less of a chance compared to other Norwegians and Swedes, but still they've been given a chance.\n\nWe have to sit down and talk with the Romani instead of calling them names, improve their schools instead of complaining they don't send their kids there, improve their standards of living instead of complaining they live in tents, improve working opportunities instead of complain they steal. There is no other solution, the same old blame-game is not a solution at all. It won't resolve anything at all.\n\nTake the Norwegian prison system, which has gotten a lot of attention world-wide the past year for being too soft. But they have very good results to show, for being soft, the prisoners mostly returns to society as functioning members. Give a person a chance - even a criminal - and you'll be surprised to find out we're all human beings capable of functioning in society.",

Most of them are of Nordic decent, like the Finnish Kale or Swedish Tatters. Most Romanis of non-Nordic decent usually only comes to Sweden for a certain period, then returns to Easter-Europe afterwards. All in all, the number of Romani that does not have a Nordic decent numbers about 10 000.\n\nThe total Jewish population is about 20 000.\n\nCompare that to Syrians which are around 150 000, Iraqis at about 135 000, or Poles which are around 90 000.\n\nHow this relatively small population should be the reason behind emigration, you'll have to explain in more detail. I am criticizing the simplistic idiocy of people not able to have argumentation, just simple claims - and what is your response? You respond with another simple claims that you give no argumentation behind. Proves to me you are a fucking idiot. You cannot even spell emigration.\n\nThe biggest reason for emigration to Sweden is war, primarily the wars in Iraq and Syria as the two biggest emigration nationalities besides other Nordic countries are Syria and Iraq. And the reason for these wars is the destabilizing effect  the American interventions and Iraqi war had on the region. So the biggest reason for emigration to Sweden is Americans, and not Gypsies or Jews.",

When you say \"dont promote this marxist bullshit on east-europeans\" Then I'm sorry, but eastern Europe is already destroyed by Marxism. \n\nHave you forgotten that already? Communism made it impossible for people to create capital in legal ways, the only way to get ahead in Eastern-Europe before the 90s was in illegal black market activities. Which is why all the capitalists in Eastern Europe has a criminal background. Look up any Russian billionaire and you'll find a guy who was a top criminal in the 80s. That is how all the Eastern-European countries are based. And the stupidest thing us \"Nordcucks\" have done was not to let muslims in, it was to agree to the Schengen agreement. Now, our prisons are filled up with people from Romania and other corrupt trashholes. Countries that has been destroyed by communism. You can keep your criminals to yourself and stop sending them up to us. You blame Jews and Muslims for destroying our country? NOPE! It's not them, it's YOU! The Jews and Muslims do not fill up our prisons like Eastern-Europeans does.\n\nAll you have is a bunch of racist utterance. Saying I have \"white guilt\". No, it's not about white guilt or propaganda. It's about what actually works. And the proof is in the pudding.\n\nHow are the Romani in Eastern Europe doing after your treatment? Not very well, a lot of them are criminals.\n\nHow are the Romani in Northern Europe doing? Well, any Romani that was here from before the 50s are pretty much all educated and in work, about average to other Scandinavians.\n\nSo what do you think works better? To keep being a racist cunt like you want? Or to give them a chance and a quality education like we did?\n\nWell, you idea that you promote lead to joblessness, criminal activities, and poor living conditions.\n\nAnd yet you keep thinking that is the solution. Good luck to you. If it hadn't been for the Schengen I wouldn't have cared. Letting Eastern-Europeans into the rest of Europe is the stupidest thing we've ever done.",

Israel was RE-formed on land previously ruled by the Ottoman empire, similarly to other countries in the region such as Lebanon, Iraq and others. There is no such thing as \"Palestinian people\". It's worth noting that newspapers such as the 'Palestine post' were Jewish newspapers (this one for example turned into the 'Jerusalem post'). This is also true about other official \"Palestine\" related stuff from the time before Israel was RE-formed. If you happened to say \"Palestinian\" before the RE-formation of Israel, you were actually referring to the Hebrews living in the land, not the Arabs. Take a look at this flag book from 1939 (3rd row on the right): imgur.com/a/4hlH2\n\nThe term \"Palestine\" was later discarded, as it should have been, because the original name for the land - Israel, has been restored (it's simple: Israel is not Palestine, just like Jerusalem is not Aelia-Capitolina, and Schem is not Nablus).\nIt is only in the mid 1960's that the Arabs hijacked the term, and its widespread usage only took off after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. the Arabs used this terminology as a political propaganda tool to de-legitimize Israel, after they failed to steal the Hebrew homeland by force with the Arab armies, by invading and attempting to conquer the land. Ironically, the term \"Palestinian\" originate from the term 'Pleshet' to describe INVADERS by the Hebrews. Those who willingly identify as \"Palestinians\" are declaring themselves to be invaders/colonizers in Hebrew land. \nIt's important to note that this propaganda tool was supported by the Communists/Soviets. On the other hand, just a few decades before that, the Arab \"Palestinians\" were hand in hand with the Nazis. They have aided them under the leadership of the mufti Amin Al Husseini - who is often regarded 'founding father' of the Arab \"Palestinians\". Mufti Amin Al Husseini became an SS general, but he had anti-jewish genocidal ideology long before the Nazis rose the power. He has incited and caused violence and terror against the Jewish people in their homeland since the early 1920's (for example: causing the 1929 Hebron massacre).\n\nYasser Arafat, the first official \"Palestinian\" leader was an Arab from Egypt, who was born and raised in Egypt and lived there till the 1950's - some \"Palestinian\" eh? \nArab \"Palestinians\" are nothing more than bands of foreign Arab invaders and illegal immigrants from all over the Arab and Islamic world (some of them even originating from places that are not part of the middle-east, such as Bosnia). Most of them came as recent as the 19th and 20th centuries. As for those who were before that - most of those were Arab Bedouins who are Arab nomadic tribes who did not permanently settle in places, and thus did not stay for prolonged periods of time. Many Arabs even came to Gaza, Judea and Samaria from Egypt and Jordan while these areas were under Egyptian and Jordanian occupation on the periods between 1948 to 1967.\n\nHere are some very informative and interesting quotes directly Arab \"Palestinian\" leaders:\n\n \"There is no such country as Palestine. 'Palestine' is a term the Zionists invented. There is no Palestine in the bible ...Palestine is ALIEN to us\" - Arab \"Palestinian\" leader Awni Abdul-Hadi, Peel Commission, 1937. \n\n\"The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct \"Palestinian people\" to oppose Zionism. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity exists only for tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan.\" - Arab \"Palestinian\" leader & PLO member Zuheir Mohsen, 1977. \n\n\"We all have Arab roots, and every Palestinian in Gaza and throughout Palestine can prove his Arab roots - whether from Saudi Arabia, Yemen or anywhere else.\" \"... Half the Palestinians are (Arab) Egyptians and the other half are (Arab) Saudis\" - Arab \"Palestinian\" Hamas minister Fathi Hammad, 2012.\n\nHere are some of the most common family names among the \"Palestinians\":\n\"Masri\" = from Egypt-Hamas member of Parliament, Mushir al-Masri (the word \"masri\" littelery means \"the egyptian\" in arabic !).\n\"Khamis\"= Bahrain \"Salem Hanna Khamis\" \"al-Faruqi\"= Mosul, Iraq\n\"al-Araj\" = Morocco, a member of the Saadi Dynasty \"Hussein al-Araj\"\n\"al Lubnani\" = the Lebanese\n\"al-Mughrabi\" = the Moroccan (Maghreb\" ‚Äì meaning \"West\" in Arabic, and usually referring to North Africa or specifically to Morocco)\n\"al-Djazair\" = the Algerian\n\"al-Yamani\" = the Yemeni \"Issam Al Yamani\"\n\"al-Afghani\" = the Afghan\n\"al-Hindi\" = the Indian \"Amin al-Hindi\"\n\"Iraqi\" = from Iraq.\n\"halabi\" = from Aleppo, Syria\n\"El Baghdadi\" = from Baghdad Iraq.\n\"Tarabulsi\"= Tarabulus-Tripoli, Lebanon.\n\"Hourani\" = Houran Syria.\n\"al-Husayni\" = Saudi Arabia.\n\"Saudi\" = Saudi Arabia.\n\"Metzarwah\"= Egypt.\n\"Barda---wil\" = \"Salah Bardawil\" HAMAS legislator in Gaza; Egypt, Bardawil Lake area.\n\"Nashashibi\" = Syria.\n\"Bushnak\" = Bosnia\n\"zoabi\"= from Iraq: \"Haneen Zoabi\".\n\"Turki\" = Turkey \"Daud Turki\"\n\"al-Kurd\" = Kurdistan.\n\"Haddadins\" = YEMEN descended from Ghassanid Christian Arabs.\n\"Arab Abu-Kishk\" = Egypt.(Bedouins)\n\"Arab al shakirat\" = Egypt (Bedouins)\n\"Arab al zabidat\" = Egypt (Bedouins)\n\"Arab al aramsha\" = Egypt (Bedouins)\n\"Abu Sitta\" = In Arabic' Abu means father and sitta means six. Translated it actually means father of six. (The Abu Sitta family primarily received this name because around the year 1700, a well known knight of the large Al-Tarabeen tribe always had six slaves (i.e. fedawyah, bodyguards), 3 on each side, with him. They were with him wherever he went, day or night. Hence the name \"ABU SITTA.\" = Egypt (Bedouins) \"Salman Abu Sitta \".)\n\nEven Yasser Arafat, the most famous \"Palestinian\" and leader of the P.L.O terrorist organization, was not native to Judea. He called himself a \"Palestinian refugee\" but spoke Arabic with an Egyptian accent. He was born in 1929 Cairo, Egypt. He served in the Egyptian army, studied in the University of Cairo, and lived in Cairo until 1956! His full name was Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat al-Qudwa al-Husseini. \"Al-Qudwa\" tribe origin?\n\nYasser Arafat also proudly stated in his authorized biography that, \"If there is any such thing as a Palestinian people, it is I, Yasser Arafat, who created them.\"\n\nHere is some genetic data for Arab \"Palestinian\":\n According to a 2010 study by Behar et al. titled \"The genome-wide structure of the Jewish people\", Palestinians tested clustered genetically close to Bedouins, Jordanians and Saudi Arabians which was described as \"consistent with a common origin in the Arabian Peninsula\".\nA study found that the Palestinians, have what appears to be Female-Mediated gene flow in the form of Maternal DNA Haplogroups from Sub-Saharan Africa. Palestinian individuals tested, carried maternal haplogroups that originated in Sub-Saharan Africa. The most likely explanation for the presence of predominantly female lineages of African origin in these areas is that they may trace back to women brought from Africa as part of the Arab slave trade, assimilated into the areas under Arab rule.\nIn a genetic study of Y-chromosomal STRs in two populations from Israel and the Palestinian Authority Area: Christian and Muslim Palestinians showed genetic differences.\nA 2013 study of Haber and et al. found that \"The predominantly Muslim populations of Syrians, Palestinians and Jordanians cluster on branches with other Muslim populations as distant as Morocco and Yemen.\"\nThe authors explained that \"religious affiliation had a strong impact on the genomes of the Levantines. In particular, conversion of the region's populations to Islam appears to have introduced major rearrangements in populations' relations through admixture with culturally similar but geographically remote populations leading to genetic similarities between remarkably distant populations.\"\nThe authors also reconstructed the genetic structure of pre-Islamic Levant and found that \"it was more genetically similar to Europeans than to (nowadays) Middle Easterners\".\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED VIDEOS TO WATCH:\nyoutube.com/watch?v=IJggz2HIkS4\nyoutube.com/watch?v=SN838zu6iio\nyoutube.com/watch?v=u8ELap2uhkA\n\nLet us now see what the Quran itself says:\nAnd thereafter We (Allah) said to the Children of Israel: 'Dwell securely in the Promised Land. And when the last warning will come to pass, we will gather you together in a mingled crowd.\" [Qur'an 17 : 104] \n\"O my people (the Hebrews)!

[Qur'an: 10 : 93]\n  \"it was Our (Allah's) will to favor those who were oppressed (the Hebrews) and to make them leaders of man, to bestow on them a noble heritage and to give them power in the land (of Israel)\".  [Qur'an: 28 : 5-6]\n \"We (Allah) gave the persecuted people (the Hebrews) dominion over the eastern and western lands which We had blessed (the east and west banks of the Jordan River). Thus your Lord's gracious word was fulfilled for the Israelites, because they had endured with fortitude [Qur'an: 7 : 137]\n\nIt's funny how so many Muslims go against Allah and the Quran when it suits them.",

The languages spoken in the whole region are indo-european languages, so it doesn't say anything. In a particular period, they have been used as sex slaves by war mongers and have got mixed with romans, various eastern Europeans and middle eastern invaders. Anyway, your comment shows the level of racisim in your own countries and why the countries you live in never came close to any country which was ruled by the British empire.  (such as Britain, USA, Canada, Australia etc) You guys basically don't now to put a proper system in place!. People of all humans are born with similar levels of intelligence, they have to be properly nurtured and supported. Big boss of the company which owns this platform (youtube) is of indian origin. So we Brits and americans know how to respect people and get them to work. While you guys in rest of the europe are just useless bunch of racists and Nazis. Glad Brexit happened!",

        "commentText": "I found this thread pretty interesting to read through. My own experiences with Romani/Gypsies began with a Bosnian Serb girlfriend in Vojvodina who primarily kept warning me to be careful every time we were walking around and passed some Gypsies. We once went to Ireland together in 2007, just after Schengen had opened up to some of the Romani, and passed several groups of Gypsies on a bus ride from Dublin to Galway. And each time we passed them, she laughed at what she perceived as ignorance concerning Schengen, namely that she believed that Western Europe would soon be overrun by Romani.\n\nI later had a Slavic Macedonian girlfriend in Skopje. She was poor and decided to live in a cheap part of Skopje that was about 50% Albanian Macedonians and 30% Macedonian Gypsies. While she lived there for about two years, she got to know some local Albanians and Romani as friends (rare for a Slavic Macedonian). At the time I already had some Albanian friends from Kosovo, but it was the first chance I'd ever really had to talk in depth with Gypsies.\n\nls7orBust: Did a Cigani ever actually steal anything from you? You failed to mention any details.\n\nPlanet Watcher: Thank you for the one comment amongst 31 that offered some insight: \"Maybe they refuse to integrate, because they hate your people out of past grievances. Get 5 Euros, give them five Euros, ask one to set around for a talk, offer them food to stay. Do not piss them off nor get angry towards.\"\n\nJamie Johnson: My understanding is that the European Romani languages have their closest relations with the Marwari language of Rajasthan. DNA evidence among today's Romani will of course show an Eastern European component, but this is primarily because the Romani have been living AMONGST Eastern Europeans for a thousand years, rather than showing an East European ORIGIN. As an anthropologist, surely you understand the difference.\n\nOne thing I noticed among the 31 comments was that only a single one came from an actual Romani. \n\nI'd really appreciate it if there are some Romani who would be interested in writing about your own experiences. I realise there will be some shitty people who will respond to you in a shitty way, and I apologise to you for that in advance.\n\nNonetheless, I would be greatly interested in hearing some perspectives from actual Romani. And thank you in advance for that. \n\nP.S. And just so everybody knows, I'm not just a sympathizer for Gypsies. I once had a wallet with about 20.000 rubles stolen by a Romani I met and got drunk with on a train from Moscow to Kazan. Even though it really pissed me off at the time, I ultimately just chalk up negative experiences like this as having met an asshole who happened to be a Gypsie, rather than to say something like all Romani must be thieves just because I had a particular bad experience with one member of their race.",

        "commentText": "@Jamie Johnson : Those who knew what Romani means are always sent to the racist area. \nIf you are able to display such absurdities as \"proves\" than you finished the school only in your imagination. \n1. Gypsies homeland is in northern India. They were one of the poorest casts there and they were forced to leave because they acted exactly as they do today. What they have in common with Eastern Europe? They found a place where they were relatively safe with the support obtained from the rulers, Ottoman Empire. Remember, in Germany and other Western countries they used to hang them if they were not burned alive. \n2. The only languages that ARE NOT Indo-Europeans are Hungarian (there are a lot of gypsies in Hungary...), Finnish, Estonian, Basque, Maltese and few in Russia. So, saying that gypsies are from Eastern Europe because there is the space where the Indo-European languages are spoken is totally wrong. \n3. You suppose to be only a British Anthropologist to sustain that DNA found on these people comes from Eastern Europe while all the companies show important percents of Eastern Asian in those people and almost nothing from the general DNA map of this region. You should understand that gypsies live in closed societies governed by their own rules and rulers. Therefore, a mixture with other people only accidentally happened.  \n4. Placing an equal sign between the Great British Empire and the Poor Countries of Eastern Europe is another, let's say, mistake. Brits were lucky to do not support the year by year assault of Ottomans, Russians, Habsburgs, and many many others. Also, to forget the horrors of the Communism is another display of infatuation and proves you have huge problems with the simplest understand of history.\n5. I never judge a whole population after few idiots. You have your own examples in the British society, I will not enter into details. But I found that Roma people have too many idiots between them. This is a simple reality and has nothing to do with racism. They oppose to all the common rules and we are not able to educate the majority of them. And, as I saw the results of your amazing Western work, you failed, too. A quick example: France has given to 185 gypsies 200 euros to leave the country and return to Romania. Guess what? In 2 weeks they went back to France hoping to grab another portion of the money. So, easy with this kind of logic, it is a total nonsense. \n6. I am sick of the way of some \"British\" show their love for the foreigners while they choose to exclude yourselves from EU. You guys are saying something and thinking the opposite. When we, Eastern Europeans show sincerity and a straight way when a problem occurs, you do not believe us. Apparently. And you are glad because the Brexit happened. What can I add? You will see another truth in few years: you need more Eastern Europeans than we need you. But then it will be late. Too late. \n7. Do you think the gypsies are poor people and you cry for them? Well, see yourself how much they steal from your country by typing in youtube search bar \"Palatele tiganilor din Romania\". If you still digest those people other than what they are then I stop here because it is useless to add something else. \n\nI have the feeling that I lost my time with you. You simply know what you know and nothing else counts.",

You can boast all you want when you enforce your culture on others but others, like the Greeks, can boast even more when their culture is copied by others without any enforcement.\nAnyway, that aforementioned notion only works for the brits as solace to the fact that they used to have an empire. A similar notion exists in Greece where people console each other by stating how everything the western world has to boast about originated from Greece. That even applies to your \"not so unique\" british chauvinism. In fact, Greeks say for almost every facet of western civilization that \"when we used to do xyz, the western barbarians still ate acorns and lived on trees\", where xyz you can put anything good (or bad) you brits(or french, or americans) do.",

In the Communism ,we ,Romanian and gypsies suffer , we all where starved ,we al where in jail for simple things ,if you don't have a job ,or they caught you with currency ,or saying something about the ones in the communist party e.t.c .I have been travelled all over the world ,in Paris ,in Lisbon in Spain in Sweden and I met them ,they seems to do the same thing ,beginning ,doing tricks with the signing petition or the ring trick ( Paris) ,in Lisbon they where trying to open my back pack ,I just felt his breath on the back of my neck , horrible. My point is ,as long as they don't want to integrate in society , there will be a lot of negativity against them .",

You tell people your from Romania,and they say gypsies,well that shows how ignorant people can be no matter where you are.Now you mention Roma not integrating ,like its just a simple choice you make,how do you see this happening?For example,if a store has a \"Help wanted\" sign in their window,and a Roma girl applys for a job,do you think she would get the job?NO .not a hope.So it requires a lot of work not just by Roma,but by settled people to.I know Roma are involved in crime,no doubt,but where I live (Ireland) it tends to be petty crime,I understand every crime effects other people,even if its minor,but think if nobody gave you money,and you had no job,and had Children to feed,would you steal? Sure you would,and you would be right to do so",

Its just you who does'nt know that, but you use their legacy on a daily basis. I mean even in the US you have one of the most successful aircraft corporations (Sikorsky Aircraft) that was found by an ethnic russian Igor Sikorsky and your TV you watch CNN/MSNBC/other shitty propaganda on, you can thank Vladimir Zworykin for that.

Stating that gypsies were slaves and, by consequence, they should be understood in their wild actions is simply not working. I smell you are one of those \"democrats/liberals\" who are screaming all day against Trump, dream at open borders and act, why oh why, only with emotions to the power of 10. I cannot read a single reasonable line there. You said Romanians are to be blamed by their political choices, actions, and mentalities. Well, where I am living is a place with 7 million people and Romanians are seen as one of the best people: hardworking, etc. Keep in mind that the first gypsy I saw here was a beggar. Raise a lot of confusion when she asks money for the kids in... ROMANIA. I know is a simple example and we should not tend to transform and generalize but, STILL, I believe this should stop. Nothing moves if you stay and search imaginary guilts to some. It is the moment to step forward and understand why, for example, we need to leave our beautiful country. And, to end my position, I am not a nazi darling, Romania is not a hateful place and some may still confuse Roma and Romanian.

Not one of us would have a value worth a Paisa if we belonged to 1 silly state out of 29. We have a nation because we are UNITED. Wasn't 800 years of foreign rule a good enough lesson for you? Back then all Indian provinces were rich, Bengal, Punjab, Rajputana, Mysore, Maratha, Chola etc. Did that save us? No. All the money and good intentions can not save precious TN from the ugly world if the soldiers from UP, Bihar, Punjab, Nagaland, Assam etc. don't protect it. If that's not enough, OUR cricket team will be shitty without each other, where else would we find such a diversity of food, culture and thought. We would be nothing without each other.

Its is lost cause, USA and EU realize it now, thats why they layed off from supporting the Albanians lately, they even harshly forbid them to form anything than resembles an army. Whenever geopolitical situation changes Serbs will run over Albanians in a week just like they did in 1999, or there will be a deal between Serbs Russia and USA since Bosnia, Montenegro and Macedonia are very unstable just like Kosovo region is, there cannot be any peace in Balkans until Serbia gets what it fought and died in millions at WW1 and WW2.",

But a very large portion of them,especially those in the ghettos, do exactly the things i've stated. The problem is that no one is actually trying to change that,the goverment \"tries\" ( that's a heavy word) to \"integrate\", but the methods that our goverment uses, are just utterly pointless and i-logical. They don't try to destroy the ghettos, they don't try to finance schooling projects, they don't try to implement laws as they are implemented on bulgarians and other ethnicities in our country. No, they do nothing of that, instead, what they do is give them political leverage in elections, when political parties base their entire support on gypsies, they don't arrest them when they do something bad (unless the city or town they did in, protests or riots), so as to not be seen as racist. I remember in school,that when i slacked off or didn't go to school, i would immediately be threathened with expelsion from school, whereas gypsies could slack off the whole year and still pass the grade.",

Anyway, your comment shows the level of racisim in your own countries and why the countries you live in never came close to any country which was ruled by the British empire.  (such as Britain, USA, Canada, Australia etc) You guys basically don't now to put a proper system in place!. People of all races are born equally in intelligence, they have to be properly nurtured and supported. Big boss of the company which owns this platform (youtube) is of indian origin.

THIS MEANS THAT JUST OVER 78% OF AFRICAN NATIONS NEED FOOD ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.\r\n- \"The Cause of Ethiopia's Recurrent Famine Is Not Drought, It Is Authoritarianism\"  https://www.huffingtonpost.com/dawit-ayele-haylemariam/the-cause-ethiopias-recurrent-famine_b_8019244.html\r\n- Also, Ethiopia was in a civil war back in the early 1980s. If it wasn't for their civil war and their government spending money on weapons to fight, they might have averted that disaster during that drought. If you'd read a book about African history you'd know this. Also, Ethiopia isn't the only country to be hit hard by drought. It happens all over the world, including the USA, Australia, Mexico, etc. Stop blaming it on that.\n- What difference does the Sudan situation make?

That's millions compered to how many immigrants europe has.\"  Yeah, absolutely none of this has ANYTHING to do with white people. In the case of the Sudan, this was something that happened between non-white people. It was the US that pressured Sudan to give independence to South Sudan. So go fuck yourself.",

Europeans of this time period mostly did'nt even live in larger countries, they were poor and lived in small dutchies, or smaller municipalities where their belongings meant their existance. I hardly believe that hard working Europeans harassed Gypsies for fun. Gypsies were known at that time for stealing the goods of locals and selling them off.

I'm not saying that the Europeans are \"bad\", just that they were a product of their circumstances - poor, uneducated and isolated, and therefore extremely xenophobic. Just like how Gypsies that steal are a product of their circumstances. When the Gypsies arrived in Europe, there simply was no option for them to integrate, because there's absolutely no way a medieval European village would welcome a bunch of different looking foreigners with a different language and religion. So yes, they began stealing, but to pretend that it's all black and white - that the Gypsies just have thievery built into their DNA would be just as ridiculous as an ancient roman saying that the germanic peoples have thievery built into their DNA because at the time they constantly raided roman borders. Modern Germans and Skandinavians don't roam around stealing shit anymore, and it has nothing to do with their genetics, it has to do with history.",

You desperately try to put the Europeans as racists and xenophobes to put the blame on them, while putting Gypsies as victims of hate directly on arrival. \n\nI never talked about their genetics. I talked about their lifestyle, which was nomadic. And hence they were nomadic, they didn't have a deeper emotional connection with their surroundings and it's local people. That means they probably always were isolated from the locals, their cultures and laws. Thievery and burglary towards the locals wouldn't have been a problem for them since they would travel anyway and never see the same people again.\n\nAlso you can't say that the disrespect originally only came from the Europeans. The gypsies could've also been xenophobic, and as a result a hatred for each other existed. Of course it has to be the Europeans who started it.",

I‚Äòm honestly surprised by your insight and reasoning. \n\nYes i think too that Europeans have to let go of their prejudices towards Gypsies. But on the other hand it isn't possible because of their lifestyle. The dilemma is, either integrate of keeping the lifestyle. As i said their lifestyle always was and is nomadic, they aren't about meeting and making close friendships with local populations. It‚Äòs due to their lifestyle which actually kept them alive for that long.\n\nBoth groups have to be reasonable, one needs to let go of prejudices and the other has to become more open to locals by letting go of their traditions.",

I guess my major argument is just that the larger/more powerful society is the one that will have to change first. I'm not saying that people should be okay with stealing or anything like that, but at the very least people need to stop believing that there's such thing as having theivery in your DNA like a lot of the racist commenters on this video seem to believe lol. Gypsies who steal do so because of their circumstances and history, not because they are incapable of ever integrating into society.",

Of course if you stress them with work and they don't have time to live, they won't shower at work . Maybe you don't see where and when they shower, and by the way every races has different shower needs.\n\nAsian people don't need to shower as much than Europeans who have more hair from the crack of their butts, especially Italian, Spanish, French, turks , Iranians, Bulgarian. Those people smell themselves more,thus shower more than Asians and they have less sweat,ear wax and discharges",

Gog and Magog are gonna ravge the earth...\nwhite europeans think gypsies and Indians dont bathe because they 'look' dirty... as these people are very hardworking and down to earth... most of them farmers and slaves... all because gog and magog came down from the caucuses and invaded the christian religion (dig into what the white popes used to do) (they were also obsessed with cleaning themselves but their actions were animalistic in nature....I'm not saying that all white slavic/europeans are gog and magog... that cant happen as even between the europeans were fights for power and the great schism is the best example for this as one part of them followed the true christianity(orthodox) and another turned christianity into an immoral/capitalistic religion (catholic)... you can see the effects of being catholics live in places like Brazil where adultery is something of the norm... poor brazillians.... they were forced to become catholics...\n\nand before any one of you say that muslims are good for nothing terrorists... I'll have you know that the worlds first ever university was built by an islamic woman (google it)... that should prove the true value that islam gives to education and womens rights... thank you and have a blessed day.",

Crete was not Greek at that time, it was Minoan and Minoans were pre-Greeks.\n\nAnatolia was mostly Greek throughout history? So that is why it was not predominantly Greek until centuries after Christianity was founded?

The Minoans used Linear A which is today still undeciphered and in no way related to Greek. The descendant of Cretan Minoan Greek, Eteocretan is also non-Greek. We can claim the Minoan civilization, just like Turks can claim ancient Anatolians, but Minoans were not Greeks and ancient Anatolians were not Turks.\n\nIndeed, Anatolian languages became extinct due to the assimilation policy of the Byzantines in addition to the fact Eastern Christianity was based on the Greek language and the Hellenes practiced great influence on Anatolia. This is also why there occurred many revolts during Byzantine rule; Anatolians, Albanians and Armenians never liked the Byzantines. They wanted to preserve their identity and when the Muslim Turks came many converted to Islam and accompanied the Turks in their Jihad against Christian nations. Examples are John Tzelepes Komnenos (Nephew of the Byzantine emperor!) and K√∂se Mihal. \n\nStop being butthurt over a city that's been Turkish for more than 500 years, please, stop behaving like a pathetic idiot.

However, creating numbers are not achievement. The real achievement were made by Ancient Greek. They mastered mathematics in absolutely new way. The Ancient Egyptians were great mathematicians before and the Ancient Mesopotamians too, but the Greek took their knowledge from them and evolved it into higher mathematics. In mathematics, you will usual find Greek letters, I wonder why. And even the word mathematics is Greek. Pythagoras and other Ancient Greeks were the first to discover unknown fields of mathematics. \n\nIt's sad to see the desert cults dominating in my continent. Indo-European polytheism makes war more sense and is more comparable with God's rules than the desert religions. Polytheism is satanic and evil, however, I benefit from the knowledge.",

Eurasians are only somewhere between 1-4% Neanderthal, you guys didn't evolve from Neanderthals, your ancestors just had sex with them and produced fertile children. And another thing, if Neanderthal DNA makes you automatically superior, then you should know that there are some Africans who actually do have Neanderthal heritage, like the San, the Masaai, and the Afar, just to name a few.\n\nI never said all humans are 100% the exact same, but you can't deny the fact that all human beings alive today are the same species and subspecies. The closest thing we would have to actual subspecies would be isolated populations like Australian Aboriginals and African Pygmies, and even they have a decent amount of non-Aboriginal and non-Pygmy heritage.\n\nBack to the Neanderthal point: Neanderthals were roughly as smart as modern humans, despite their larger brains. They were more developed in some parts of their brains than we are, but they were also underdeveloped in certain regions too. We \"conquered\" them thanks to us having superior numbers, as Neanderthals were never a very large species to begin with. Over time, the Neanderthals who didn't go to war with Homo sapiens bred themselves to extinction, and the last remnants of them died out some 30,000-40,000 years ago in Southern Europe. There is no evidence to suggest that they were 100% more intelligent than us, sorry to disappoint you.",

        "commentText": "sonikku956 Dont say \"Turks\" but just Turks because I know you think Turks are mixed but that's like saying Greeks are mixed.\n\nThe Greek language came from the Proto-Indo-European homeland in Ukraine/Russia. By means of migrations the Indo-Europeans spread to many regions in the world and assimilated the pre-Indo-European peoples of the regions they settled in. Some regions were settled by many Indo-European tribes, like Kyrgyzstan and Kashmir, but others not so much. Genetic studies show that Greeks barely have ancestry from Indo-Europeans, especially Cretans. What happened is, after 3000 BC the Greek Indo-European tribes who were heavily outnumbered by pre-Greeks imposed their identity and language on the pre-Greeks, who had their own identity and language but lost those due to the assimilation. The modern Greeks are primarily descended from pre-Greeks.\n\nThe exact same process happened to Turks. There are two differences : 1. Turks have more Central Asian ancestry than Greeks have Indo-European ancestry 2. Anatolian Turks assimilated and mixed with non-Turks after 1071 while Greeks assimilated and mixed with non-Greeks around 3000-1500 BC. \n\nThe pre Greeks were the Leleges, the Pelasgians, the¬†Cretan Minoans, the¬†Cycladic¬†Telkhines, and the¬†Tyrrhenians. The classical¬†Hellenes¬†emerged as an amalgam of these five peoples mixed with a tiny percentage of Indo-European (Greek).\n\nSo if you say Turks are fake Turks, Greeks must be fake Greeks too... And that's a wrong comparison because genetic studies show Turks have more Central Asian ancestry than Greeks have Indo-European ancestry. Even if that was not the case, Turks are Turks and that will never change.",

Don't think so.\n\nWhat if I told you there are many different types of Turks and Turkic languages, and that Turks have never been entirely Mongoloid?\n\n\nThere are Oƒüuz, Uyghur, Kipchak, Oƒüur and Yakut/Siberian Turks and all differ from each other both genetically and linguistically. Central Asian Turks are not as closely related as one would suggest, there is a big difference between a Turkmen (Oƒüuz) and a Kazakh (Kipchak).\n\nAll Turks are a mix of the Caucasoid and Mongoloid races, Turks do not belong to one race, unlike most Subsaharan Africans, East Asians & Native Americans and Europeans. Kipchaks are Turks that have always been more Mongoloid than Caucasoid, while Oƒüuz Turks have always been more Caucasoid than Mongoloid. Genetic studies show Turkmen are 18‚Äì40% Mongoloid or East Asian.\n\nThere is a lot of confusion due to this fact. Genetic studies on Turkey's Turks often use ‚ÄúCentral Asian‚Äù and ‚ÄúEast Asian‚Äù interchangeably while they are two distinct things. The Turks seem to have 5‚Äì15% East Asian or Mongoloid ancestry, with peaks as high as 20%, but researchers call this ancestry ‚ÄúCentral Asian‚Äù due to confusion. The Central Asian ancestry of Turks is actually higher than that because of part of our ancestry that is racially Caucasoid but from Central, not West Asia.\n\nCommercial DNA tests also do this. They look at your Mongoloid ancestry and then interpret only that as Central or East Asian. This is why Uzbeks and Turkmen score more West Asia than Central Asia with these DNA tests. They are very faulty and need improvement.\n\nGEDmatch is a site that does not do this but compares your ancestry to that of random individuals from many ethnic groups, including Turkmen. So Caucasoid ancestry from Turkmenistan will be interpreted as Turkmen.\n\nMy DNA test told me I am 16% West Asian and 4% Central Asian, GEDmatch tells me I am somewhere between ~13‚Äì22.3% Turkmen. Anatolian Turks are often 50%- 25% Turkmen, while Balkan Turks are often 25%-12.5% Turkmen. Azerbaijani Turks can be anywhere between ~6%-50% Turkmen and many of them have Anatolian Turkish ancestry as well because Selim I sent Shia Turcoman tribes to Iran, which controlled ethnographic Azerbaijan.\n\nBecause we still have quite some Turkmen ancestry, many of us look like them. But since we have a lot of non-Turkmen ancestry as well, there are also many people that look like westernmost Asians or Europeans. But looking European does not mean they have no Turkmen ancestry. Your appearance is decided while you are in your early development stages, still in your mothers belly and the way you look is completely random. That is why one sibling can be blue-eyed and blonde, but his sister can be a brunette and brown-eyed. Their looks are different, but their ancestry is the exact same.\n\nMy own cousins are like that. One of them is blue eyed, very pale and blond, her sister looks like me; tan, brown-eyed and a brunette. However, both have Central Asian ancestry.\n\nI also want to mention that there are 15 million Turkish citizens like Circassians, Lazes, Albanians, Bosniaks and more that generally do not have Central Asian ancestry and they are very common in Turkey as you can tell by their number. However, they feel Turkish so they also identify as Turkish. That's another reason why Turkey has many White citizens. Most of these Circassians, Albanians, Bosniaks etc. (especially the latter two) settled in West Turkey. Izmir and the Marmara region are full with Albanians and Bosniaks! Turks from Macedonia as well, one neighbourhood, a quite big one too, is almost entirely inhabited by Turks from Macedonia.\n\nMy mom's family also lives there.. and we are also Turks from Macedonia!\n\nBottom line : There are Turks that look like the Turkmen settlers, and Turks that look more like ancient Anatolians or Europeans, but all have Central Asian ancestry.",

        "commentText": "Elias Turkified Greeks my ass. The Greeks and Armenians of Anatolia were merely hellenized and armenified Anatolians like Leo pointed out. Tigran the Great armenified the region and spread Armenian culture and language. Alexander the Great, Christianity and subsequently the Byzantines all hellenized Anatolia, but their genetics were in no way Greek.\n\nMatter of fact, the Byzantine emperors and Trapezuntian scholars even called the Empire of Trebizond nothing more than a Lazic border state, because there were almost only Lazes that became hellenized overtime. Hence genetic studies show Pontic Greeks have literally almost no Greek ancestry.\n\nThe Greek language came from the Proto-Indo-European homeland in Ukraine/Russia. By means of migrations the Indo-Europeans spread to many regions in the world and assimilated the pre-Indo-European peoples of the regions they settled in. Some regions were settled by many Indo-European tribes, like Kyrgyzstan and Kashmir, but others not so much. Genetic studies show that Greeks barely have ancestry from Indo-Europeans, especially Cretans. What happened is, after 3000 BC the Greek Indo-European tribes who were heavily outnumbered by pre-Greeks imposed their identity and language on the pre-Greeks, who had their own identity and language but lost those due to the assimilation. The modern Greeks are primarily descended from pre-Greeks.\n\nThe exact same process happened to Turks. There are two differences : 1. Turks have more Central Asian ancestry than Greeks have Indo-European ancestry 2. Anatolian Turks assimilated and mixed with non-Turks after 1071 while Greeks assimilated and mixed with non-Greeks around 3000-1500 BC. \n\nSo if you say Turks are fake Turks, Greeks must be fake Greeks too...\n\nOur nation is Turkish and we are not Greek or Armenian. Heck, even Greeks and Armenians are largely just assimilated Anatolians. Many Byzantine Anatolians and even royals like John Tzelepes Komnenos willingly converted to Islam and became Turks. Matter of fact, a Byzantine prince helped the Ottomans to gain hold of Gallipoli which is the reason Ottomans could conquer the Balkans!\n\nWe are Turks and our nation is Turkey. It was established by many peoples that became Turkish and every single nation was created like that. The island of Lemnos was still pre-Greek until Athenians hellenized it in the 600 BC! Where are the Leleges? Tyrrhenians? Pelasgians? Colchines? Huh? Where are they? They were assimilated by am extremely small amount of Indo-European Greeks. Should I call you hellenized non-Greeks now? \n\nOfcourse not. You are just a butthurt, racist and insecure little child that hates Turks with a passion. Instead of hating on Turks for things that happened to all peoples, start hating on your own people for deporting you to foreign lands only because of your religion. If your ancestors said they were Greek, why didn't the government let them stay? I am angry at my government for not letting the Turkish Christians of Karaman, who proudly fought for our independence, stay although they wanted so much. I dont hate on Greece for accepting them. I criticize Turkey for that, and you should do the same to the Greek government... sorry, I mean hellenized pre-Greek fake Greek government.",

The descendants of Alexander the Great your referring to are a minority living in Pakistan and Afghanistan and they accept that. They are referred as Kalash people, an ancient ethnic group living high in the remote mountains of Pakistan. They are a result of Alexander's army and they have maintained them values ie they marry in the same tribe and they don't mix with any other group of people. They are light skin, coloured eyes, European looking. So yes that's the Alexander tribe. Also my paternal grandmas side all have blue/green coloured eyes, just so you know people in Asia are in different shapes, sizes and have different skin tones, shades. South Asia is diverse and no people are not rape products just because one has coloured eyes! Many empires ruled these countries so please, let's not give your Alexander the Great all the credit lol",
