        "postText": " Infighting has broken out within the US Democratic party, as a result of perceived anti-Semitic statements from Ilhan Omar who is one of the first Muslim women to serve in Congress. House Democrats will introduce a resolution tomorrow condemning anti-Semitism. The text will not mention Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar by name. But the rebuke is seen as a response to a comment she made on Sunday. She said that the pro-Israel lobby in the US is 'pushing for allegiance to a foreign country'. It's the latest in an ongoing struggle between the Democratic leadership and a small number of freshmen Democrats who have been vocal about pushing the party further to the left..

If someone is shedding light on the criminal behavior of a government, such as ilegal colonization, military attacks, destruction of fields and houses, land confiscation, attacks on religious minorities, ilegal detentions, and systematic brutalization of a population and then you try to change the subject and derail. That's just cowardly  and dishonest. Shame on you, you are truly a wicked individual.",

But some facts merit mention:\n\n* In the US, Steven Miller has been actively promoting the racialization of Central American asylum seekers, which is a head scratcher given  all  that's outlined in this article.  AIPAC has been  mute.  \n\n* David Frum just published an article in the Atlantic magazine arguing for the freezing of all US immigration.  Sounds like he's trying to confuse the public with the argument that will be used against the Palestinians' right of return. 'A country has the right to say no to immigration.'\n\n* US Neocons forced the Iraqi invasion/destruction, and in the process destabilizing the Middle Esast. Millions were displaced and millions have entered the Europe, while its economies have yet to recover from the 2008 US-driven economic recession\n\n* Netanyahu, US casino owner Sheldon Adelson et al engineered  Jerusalem's and most recently the Golan Heights land grab.    Concurrently, some media headlines have been arguing there has been no reaction to the announcement to legitimize it .  Really? \n\n* The Likud Party issued a manifesto announcing the unilateral appropriation of the occupied territories.  \n\n* Bob Rubin & friends eliminated the Glass-Steagall Act, which allowed 'Sandy Weill' to create a financial supermarket meant to stimulate market competitiveness.   The ensuing looting caused the 2008 Great Recession & destruction of  American families.",

If I criticize AIPAC, \nand I do because they do not have the best interests of the Jews at \nheart; I don't mean for their influence to be traded in for Muslim \ninfluence. Omar does. Neither does Omar care about how AIPAC is harming \nJews who aren't into the money/power cult. \nYou Gentiles cannot criticize AIPAC fairly. When you Gentiles \"criticize Zionism\" it, it is \nalways anti-Semitic and perhaps serves much more nefarious interests.\nThere is only one People who have a tribe called The Benjamins, baby. She didn't mean $100 bills. Her dog whistle is tuned low.\nPS: The Republicans' protestations of defending the Jews against the \nanti-Semitism of Omar is as repulsive to me as Omar. You're making \npolitical capital of what she said. You fundamentalist Christian \nwingbats hate the Jews as much as she does. Never forget Islam is a \nChristian project that was devised to create a barbarian army to go \nagainst the Jews.\nThe Christians are only whining because their Frankenstein they meant to set on us us attacking them too.",

In fact she seems surprised USA is not like Canada nor UK and we have no hate crime laws.  Accordingly, no matter how much I might or might not hate Islam, and no matter how much I may express such hatred to Islam in this post?  She has no standing against me.\n\nAnd thus I flat out observe the absolute truth that Muhammad was an actual real life desert gangster.  And Omar has no recourse against me.",

But didn't her remarks display barely-veiled hatred?    Far from wanting to discipline her, several young Democrats interviewed by Van Jones (who threw them a softball) united to PRAISE this viper for bringing up 'difficult conversations'.   They are angling shamelessly for the votes of millenials who do not know up from down or left from right, because they have not been taught history as a social science.   Badges of 'identity' are the going moral currency, NOT TRUTH.    \n\n\nIt is not because of Jewish ingenuity, malevolent or otherwise, that the modern state of Israel exist.   If God were not active in history to preserve the people whom He called for His own purposes, and to restore them to their original land when more than half their 3500-year history has been spent in exile, 'Zionism' would never have been more than a pipe dream.  \n\n\nJewish history, and most centrally the figure of Jesus Christ (born a Jew), is one of the most overwhelming evidences that the God of the Bible and the Creator of this universe are one and the same.   Whether Jews do good or evil in this world does not alter that fact.   But the world has benefited from the Jewish heritage in ways which are beyond calculation and often overlooked.",

                    "commentText": "+Ikar Ade \nGlad to hear that 'women's liberation' has reached Somalia to that extent.   I remember hearing from Ayaan Hirsi Ali about female circumcision-----------confirming what I had read decades earlier.   From that angle your suggestion is encouraging.   \n\n\nBeyond that, it would be pleasant to hear no more of Ms. Omar's wicked remarks in the Western world.   But there are plenty others who will repeat the same things.  Unfortunately her own party, concerned with giving the appearance of 'unity', is not courageous enough to discipline her.    It is like praising a spoiled child.    Of course the Republicans treat Donald Trump exactly the same way!   \n\n\nOne thing unites Somalis, Israelis, Westerners, everybody--------------we have the same human nature.   The Bible says, 'for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.'   We are in a hopeless situation before a holy God, Who cannot tolerate sin.   Therefore He sent a sin-bearer, to take OUR guilt upon Himself.   Under the Law of Moses, the ancient Israelites used to sacrifice innocent animals, knowing neither right nor wrong.  It says in the Bible, 'that 'without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.'    But those sacrifices symbolized something else; animal blood does not have in itself special properties which cleanse from sin.   \n\n\nFinally God sent Jesus of Nazareth, born of a virgin, His Son (begotten and NOT MADE, because He existed since eternity).   Once Jesus had paid the price for sin in His own blood, there was no further need of sacrifice.   When He died on the cross, He said, 'IT IS FINISHED'.    And the curtain which cordoned off the holiest place in the Jerusalem temple was torn from top to bottom.   This was the sign that through Jesus' sacrifice we now have access to God the Father.   \n\n\nJesus said, 'I AM THE WAY, AND THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE; NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH ME.'",

                    "commentText": "+Howard Patterson \nNo mystery there.   What she says is evil.   Her hijab represents an evil religion.  Human nature itself is evil, 'for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.'  \n\n\nWe can tie this all up together.   Islam is evil, because it pretends that humans can reach God by religious effort.  The Bible says instead that we are justified by faith, that salvation is a free gift from God.   No wonder islam is dead set against Jews and Christians, because the message of Christ the ONLY Savior started among the Jews.",

Now if you DO NOT criticize the North Korean regime, then either you are ignorant of the situation, or you do not care about the interests of North Koreans, BECAUSE THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT REPRESSES THEM MERCILESSLY.    And if we postulate that unification of Korea under the South Korean system (or something like it) is preferable to conquest of the whole peninsula by force, by the North---------------then we can safely say that an anti-North (or anti-Kim) position is pro-Korean.   Get it?   \n\n\nNow clearly the Israeli government is NOT perfect.   But it DOES NOT oppresss its own citizens (not even Palestinians) on anything near the scale that North Korea oppresses its own citizens.   And it DOES allow criticism from within, whereas North Korea certainly DOES NOT.   After all, it has a parliament, the Knesset, in which even radical Arab nationalists have been allowed to sit as representatives.    \n\n\nSo what is your point?   Let's change the subject.   Do you believe in Jesus?   It says in Romans 10:9 'that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.'",

                    "commentText": "+Nick Tesla \nNever heard 'anti-corruption' used as a noun before.   Not applicable here anyhow,\nbecause the woman's intent and understanding are corrupted by her upbringing in the CULT of islam.   Brainwashed, she is incapable of reasoning about these matters.    \n\n\nWe have FIVE accounts in the New Testament testifying to the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, including Paul's story in the book of Acts.   In 1st Corinthians chapter 15, Paul lays out the evidence in order, listing over 500 contemporary witnesses.   And in order to have a Resurrection one must first have a death.   There are four separate Gospel accounts of Jesus' crucifixion, which both He and multiple Hebrew prophets before Him had prophesied.   \n\n\nWhat is the point?   That islam denies BOTH the death AND the Resurrection of Jesus.   Yet most SECULAR historians agree that He was executed by the Romans.   So then, ISLAM IS NOT CONCERNED WITH FACTS, but with the spreading of lies convenient to its message, for the furtherance of its temporal power in the world.   It has NO spiritual power, except for EVIL.   Only deluded people take Ilhan Omar seriously.",

She is certainly not a hater of Jewish people! Unlike the hypocritical far right republican politician, trump supporters who are just haters full stop!!! Pointing out the influence of AIPAC In Washington and criticizing the extremist far right Israeli government does not constitute anti semitism!! It is just stating the reality as Glenn Greenwald quite rightly points out! And the Dems bought by AIPAC prove the point made by Ilhan!!",

They probably don't know that in countries of origin, islamism is an ideology of the far Right.    I wonder whether they know ANY history, except from an 'identitarian' perspective.   \n\n\nHow ironic:  it was Harry Truman, a Democrat, who acted boldly to recognize the infant state of Israel, because he had some understanding of Bible prophecy.",

What I mean is, the same question can be asked of any country, lobby group or special interest and it will not generate this much fury, contempt or any anti remarks by any politician because in a democracy any question is up for debate. My question to you is, why this particular question can't be negated and must not be debated in America, the cradle of democracy??????????????????????????",

                    "commentText": "+Ina Adam turab \nWell then, how do you propose to 'free' yourself?   In fact, human beings are enslaved to their own SIN.   Don't worry about the Jews or the Zionists.   Worry about how YOU will enter heaven.   There is only one possible way.   Jesus said (John 14:6), 'I AM THE WAY, AND THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE; NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH ME.'   \n\n\nRomans 10:9 says 'that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.'   \n\n\nYou might be interested to know that Jesus said, 'Salvation is from the Jews' (see John 4:22).   But CLEARLY He did NOT say that one must be Jewish in order to be saved, NOR did He say that being Jewish saves anyone!    However, there are some Jews who ARE saved, who DO believe in Jesus.   Do you want them to enter heaven while you are left behind?   SURELY NOT.   \n\n\n(Romans 5:8)  'For God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.'",

Israel is not the Jewish religion or the Jewish people, although its government is run by people that are Jewish. Why should Israel be the only country in the world that cannot be criticized or their policies questioned? Under American law you can be critical of or question the senate, the president, God himself but cannot question anything to do with Israel!? And when someone is critical of the status quo then it's \"anti-semitism\", either those people don't understand what that word means or they're intentionally choosing to misuse it.",

                    "commentText": "+kouti eightyeight \nGod bless you for sticking to the truth in this instance.   There are other moral issues on which your party has caved (I speak as a non-partisan).   I hope that you will revisit the question of abortion, which is a SOCIAL EVIL leading to the decimation of generations, not merely a question of a <b> woman'</b>s 'choice'.   The choice has already been made when the act which may lead to conception has begun, be that consensual or forced or somewhere in between (i.e. forced in all but name).   \n\n\nI am implying, of course, that the<b>  woman</b> often has less than 50 percent involvement in the INITIAL choice, when she really ought to be in charge of the situation.   Very few women having that INITIAL choice would agree to forego the joys and pains of motherhood; on the contrary, many would willingly sacrifice their own lives for the sake of their children.    So shaming women, insisting that they bear the entire moral burden, is not the solution, because the decision is usually a collective one, enriching so-called 'doctors' (professional hitmen, in actuality).   \n\n\nWhich shall it be?   A large military and a mushrooming plutocracy, or a genuine 'culture of life', with appropriate social supports and a view to changing MALE behavior?    \n\n\n(Micah 6:8)  'He has told you, O man, what is good, and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?'",

Just because you are a Jew, it dos not mean you are Semitic. To be a Semitic, you must come from or be a descendant of northern Africa or the near east. The Semitic languages come from this region. Arabic is a Semitic language and has been around before Hebrew. Hebrew is a Semitic language but almost died out. From 300 AD to 1700 AD, the Hebrew language almost disappeared. It was only used by Priests and the like in the Judaic religion for 1400 years. Hebrew did not come back until the 18th century. It was the Jews that came to Israel in the past 150 years. It was not Semitics nor descendants of Issac that came to Israel in the past 150 years. It was European Jews that have come to Israel in the past 150 years. Therefore its extremely hard to be anti-Semitic towards Jews today as only 10% of Jews today have Semitic ancestry. 90% of Jews today do not have a Semitic genealogy. They have there family tree that dates back to Europe, 15000 years ago. https://www.livescience.com/40247-ashkenazi-jews-have-european-genes.html",

She might gloat about Israel's sins if she did, but at the same time she would stand condemned for her antisemitism--------------because GOD LOVES SINNERS while hating sin.   The natural human tendency, which she exemplifies, is to hate other sinners while justifying one's own sin in one's own mind.   'Criticism' from that angles solves<b>  nothing</b>, but augments strife and reinforces division.",

They spread peace as they proclaim the Gospel of Yeshua/Jesus among other Jews and to the nations.   Jesus secured peace between God and man by His death on the cross.   We become beneficiaries when we believe in Him.  \n\n\nSome call these people Messianic Jews; they used to be called Hebrew Christians.   The label does not matter so much.   They are often persecuted by their own unbelieving families when they turn to Christ.   But Christ definitely and uniquely fulfilled the Hebrew prophecies concerning the Messiah to come, hundreds of them.   So without doubt they have got the main message as it was intended.   \n\n\nUnfortunately the majority tendency in Jewish religion, even when Christ walked the earth, was insular and self-seeking.   \n\n\nIf you deplore that self-seeking attitude, that narrow sort of <b> nationalism,</b> I hope that you will condemn it also among Palestinians, indeed within any national\ngroup on the face of the earth.   As for the 'world mafioso', there are many contenders for that title, not all of them Jewish!    There are also plenty of Anglos, Arabs, Chinese, whatever, whose god is money.   \n\n\n\nTheir end will come.   (James 5:1)  'Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries which are coming upon you.'",

Why? Because it is the will of God and America is big enough to take the hit so we can do it again and again and again. This is what we do to countries that we hate.

The<b>  nation</b> of Israel has been our only real and trusted ally that we've had in the middle east.

Israel has only caused problems to the US in it's present form. Israel is a <b> racist </b>segregationist apartheid state that practices racial discrimination on a national scale. It violates the most basic civil rights of Palestinians and inflicts unimaginable humiliation and suffering upon them. By the way if you  love the Ancient Hebrews so much here are a couple of things you should know. \n\nWhere do you think the Palestinians came from? Do you really believe that the Romans expelled every single Jews from the region in the Roman Jewish wars 2000 years ago with the fall of Jerusalem??? That is<b>  nothing</b> but a myth. Many Jews across many towns embraced Roman and Greek culture, some even became Roman citizens and became loyal subjects of Rome. Many of these Jews refused to join the Jewish rebellions against Rome and instead were protected by the Romans against the religious zealots who did rebelled against Rome and would often attack them. Many of these Jews later became Christians and later converted to Islam once the Arabs arrived in the 7 the century. Even today 1/3 to 1/4 of all Palestinians are Christians. If you go to Israel today and you start digging in most archeological sites you will find evidence of a many Jews who embraced the Roman empire and it's Greek culture. You will find ruins of aqueducts, public pools, Roman public markets places, amphitheatres, public baths and so on. You will find evidence that many Jews embraced Roman culture, Roman life, culture and Roman rule. The Romans not only did not expell these Jews from the region, they protected them from the militant Jewish Zealots who would often attack them.\n\nListen, there are three courses for this conflict, two Countries or one country. The Israelis can either have Apartheid South Africa or they can have Singapore. When Singapore became independent from the British they had thre<b> e ethni</b>c groups with three different religions who were killing each other. Buddists who were predominantly Chinese, Malay who were predominantly Muslim and Hindus who were predominantly Indians. Their prime Minister Kwan Lee, United them all and imposed affirmative action. He forced them to share everything in accordance with their population equally. Today Singapore is one of the richest country in the world, yet it's much smaller than Israel and it has no natural resources whatsoever. That is the best course of action for this conflict. One country two two peoples, three religions.",

You have to understand that anti-semitism is primarily driven not by a belief that they are inferior but by seeing them as a threat.  Which is why implying dual loyalty of Jew living in America is anti Semitic.  No one would accuse a British person of dual loyalty for wanting the US to maintain good relations with the UK but she can accuse Jews of that for being pro-Israel.  Which doesn't mean they never criticize Israel!  But Israel is the most civilized country in the region by far.  Even Muslims are safer there than they are in their own countries, whereas a Jew could never live in most Muslim countries at all.",

(Romans 3:23) 'For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.'   It seems a little weak strategically, to attack sin in such a piecemeal manner as you suggest-----------only American sin, and only in one or two areas!   Are the rest of us so good?   I think you delude yourself by your optimism.   \n\n\nFortunately for us, God became incarnate as a Jewish man in the form of Jesus Christ.   Though innocent, He died on a Roman cross for the very reason that our sin and its guilt might be put away.   (Romans 5:8)  'For God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.'   \n\n\nISRAEL.   I mentioned it.   I am no antisemite, to be sure.  So to answer your initial question, it depends HOW one mentions Israel.   Now you, on the other hand........",

You can criticise any thing in this country, from God, to the President and all the countries on this planet including these you named but how talking about Israeli lobbies and their heavy influence in our foreign affairs makes someone anti-Semitic? Is talking about the Vietnam or Iraq war making us anti-white or anti-American?! Clearly not. Then the math isn't right here. 2+2 is always 4 except when it is in regards to Israel. Look how much support she got. Majority of the population are on her side. Why? Because she talked about something that exists but their funded agents or these with long-term political goals, the <b> old </b>as opposed to fact-checking new gen., are going to label you as a<b>  racist</b> or anti-Semitic guy.

It is very clear that she is Anti Israel and totally ignores the plight of other people around the world. Her remarks, be it what they want to call them, would eventually lead to hate against Jews because she is saying that the Palestinians are oppressed and thereby she is making Israel look like a villain which it is not. Ilhan is in effect stirring up emotions against the Jews. Doesn't anyone wonder the obvious why Ilhan Omar's first thing to do in congress was to criticize Israel? Does that look normal to you? She fled Somalia but she has <b> nothing </b>to say about Somalia?",

Trump also gets criticized by U.S. allies. No one calls that \"anti-Americanism\", because it isn't.\nNote that there are also left wing pro Israel groups like J Street and Peace Now USA who agree with Ilhan Omar's criticism and who support her.\nIt is a typical right wing populist strategy to identify a whole people with the government or one person in that government who claims to be the voice of the people when actually he merely represents a small percentage of that people. In that way then the right wing populist can deflect all criticism of his government and claim it would be a criticism of the entire people. Right wing populists everywhere do the same. Netanyahu isn't that special in this regard.",

Approximately two thirds of the money Hamas raises from international sources is spent on military buildup. Of its total budget, 55% goes to the military wing, a significant increase from 15% in 2014. Meanwhile, Hamas' civil affairs budget has decreased by nearly 50% in that same period.\u00a0 Hamas' financial reports further reveal that tens of millions of dollars designated for rebuilding Gaza were actually being invested in real estate projects in Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Dubai.",

Somali culture, as I have heard, is inextricably linked with islam, to the extent that a Somali who leaves islam must leave the <b> ethnic </b>community in order to be safe.  \nAs I have observed in my own town, Somalis are very 'sticky' socially, tending to segregate themselves.    \n\n\nCare for other members of one's<b>  ethnic</b> community is not always a bad thing, so long as the sentiment behind it is not chauvinistic.   So I don't fault thi<b> s woma</b>n for being pro-Somali, only for being anti-Jewish.   But islam is a cult based on lies, superstition, and coercion, so it undermines the Somali community morally, socially, and spiritually.   But those who are brainwashed may not realize that they have a problem, BECAUSE their brainwashing tells them that they are in the right.   \n\n\nOne must realize also that islam has a low view of Jews.   In this sense antisemitism is 'baked into' Somali culture.   One cannot expect much better from th<b> is wom</b>an because of her background.   She may apologize, but only to the extent that she escapes trouble.   \n\n\nT<b> his wo</b>man can only be redeemed in the same way as others are, by repenting and believing in the Lord Jesus Christ.",

Do you want me to quote from the Torah all the times Jewish prophets advocated for the genocide of entire peoples and nations? Ask yourself the question why was King Saul ousted by the Jewish God? What did he failed to do? What were the ancient Hebrews ordered to do to all the peoples who inhabited their \"promise Land\"?   What were they supposed to do to the Malekites? Many modern day Jewish extremists quote those passages and equate today's Palestinians with the ancient Malekites. From all the holy books the Torah is the most violent, genocidal and blood thirsty. Far more than any of them. Far more genocidal than the New Testament or the Hadiths. All the bad things about Islam came straight out and we're copied straight out of Judaism. Who first advocated to the stoning of women to death for adultery and execution of people for blasphemy, animal sacrifice, burning people alive, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth? The only reason why you don't see modern day Jews behaving according to their holy texts is because their temple was destroyed and the Sanhedrin council Jewish court made out of law givers ( Pharisees) has been dissolved by the Romans.  Letter for letter Judaism is far more violent or even far more extreme than extreme radical Islam. Islam is a cheap copy of Judaism.",

Meanwhile the Islamic Republic of Iran executed at least \n285 people in 2018 alone. With respect to<b>  LG<b> BT<<b> /b</b</b>>> rights, Israel is the most liberal in \nthe Middle-East, even though homosexuality is sanctioned in the Old-Testament.\n \nMultiple Islamic countries chose to use Islamic sharia lore as the basis for their legal system.\nIran, Pakistan, Sudan, ..., etc. Freedom of religion is not respected, apostates are put to \ndeath, homosexuals are executed. Iran even has on it's statute books  \"Corruption on earth\"\n& \"Crimes against God\" -  see the case of Pastor Matthias Haghnejad\n\n\nIn short Islamic texts play a central role in the legal systems of many countries.

Furthermore, there are a lot of predominantly Muslim countries that don't have Sharia as their their legal law with. As a matter of fact, most don't. They have secular Constitutions. Moreover, you can't deny that the Torah was the greatest influence of the Qoran on it's views of women, gays, penalties for infidelity, blasphemy, not eating pork, circumcision and so so much more.

AIPAC is small beans,  its not even in the top 50 of donors! it is not what Omar is making it out to be. BUT it is an American Jewish organization. Look up CUFI, Christians United for Israel, they make up 30% of the American voting block, and outnumber jews on this earth tenfold!  BTW Omar took $60,000 from CAIR (Centerfor American Islamic Relations)  bit of a hypocrite too",

                    "commentText": "+amrit bansal \nYou imply that the Israeli state requires apologists.   Why should it, any more than any other existing state?   'Legitimacy' of states can be understood objectively in two ways:  as an expression of 'de facto' political reality, and as an expression of God's sovereign will being carried out upon the canvas of history.   The Israeli state fits both criteria, because (a) it exists; and (b) it exists according to the will of God.   Whether you think that God permitted it to exist, contrary to His own distinct preference, or DESIGNED it to exist as part of a larger fulfilment of His promises made to Abraham through Isaac and Jacob, is another matter.   Your own subjectively anti-Biblical view seems evident.  \n\n\n(Romans 13:1b)  'For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God.'   \n(Acts 17:26-27)  '.........and He made from one man [one blood] every <b> nation </b>of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation.'   \n\n\nPeople should be careful of using 'legitimate' political criticism as a<b>  thin</b> cloak for antisemitic hatred, which in my opinion is EXACTLY what Ms. Omar has done.   Her prejudices proceed from the perverse dogmas of the religion in which she was raised.",

                    "commentText": "+@Sondos Hussein \nBe that as it may, many individual muslims express contempt for Israel, as do many people of various traditions.   Indeed the role of Israel in God's plan of salvation,\nits historical reason for being, CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD APART FROM BIBLICAL REVELATION.    \nThe Lord Jesus Christ, God made incarnate as a Jewish man, said:   'salvation is from the Jews'  (see John 4:22).   Yet He did NOT say that one must be Jewish in order to saved, NOR (quite evidently!) did He say that being Jewish saves anyone in itself.    What He DID say is as follows:   \n\n\n(John 14:6)  'I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.'   \n\n\nSo the claims and statements of the HISTORICAL Jesus are COMPLETELY incompatible with islam.   You must choose one or other.   Your eternal destiny depends upon it.   But take courage:   it says in 1st Timothy 2:4-5 that God 'desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.   For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.'",
