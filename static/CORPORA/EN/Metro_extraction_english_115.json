        "postText": "The Apprentice candidate Lottie Lion has hit back at claims she\u2019s racist\u2019 after comments from the cast\u2019s WhatsApp group leaked online.', 'The 19-year-old is among one of the favourites to land Lord Alan Sugar\u2019s \u00a3250,000 investment after an impressive start in episode one last week, but she\u2019s immediately been thrown into a thunderstorm after telling Lubna Farhan \u2013 whose parents hail from Pakistan \u2013 to \u2018Shut up Gandhi\u2019.', 'Mahtama Gandhi led the fight for India\u2019s independence from Great Britain in 1947.', 'According to The Sun, Lottie claimed she\u2019d never spoken to a black person before, which Lubna debunked by sending a picture of the candidate with a friend alongside the dig: \u2018I thought she\u2019d never met a \u201cblack person\u201d.\u2019', '\u2018Seriously f*** off Lubna before I f****** knock you out at our press training,\u2019 Lottie wrote back.', '\u2018Lubna I f****** swear if you disrespect me again I will f*** you up, you embarrassing failure of a businesswoman.\u2019', 'Then she added: \u2018Shut up Ghandi (sic) that doesn\u2019t even make sense.\u2019', 'Since the clash became public, Lottie has now released a statement via PA to stress: \u2018It is not true that I would ever be racist.', '\u2018My use of the word Gandhi was misinterpreted, it was as candidates in the group chat had been quoting Gandhi previously.', '\u2018The comments were taken out of context, and I ask the public not to make judgment without knowing the full context.', '\u2018At the moment, I would like my focus to be on the show, and I\u2019m not interested in negative media attention.\u2019', 'Metro.co.uk has reached out to a spokesperson for The Apprentice for further comment.', 'Last week Lottie revealed she was targeted by a group of teens, who have been sending her death threats before the first episode of The Apprentice had even aired. Police confirmed they have launched an official investigation.', 'The Apprentice continues Wednesday at 9pm on BBC One.",
