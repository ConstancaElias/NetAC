Caroline Abrahams, Age UK\u2019s charity director, said: \u201cFaced with too much demand and too little supply, our social care system is effectively under siege.\u201d', 'Around 700,000 requests for formal care and support made by older people in the past 12 months were not dealt with, according to analysis in the Age UK report.', 'But as many as 1.5 million over-65s in England are going without all the help they need, it is claimed.', 'OAPs seeking care who did not meet the eligibility criteria in 23 percent of cases had their files closed.', 'In 46 percent of cases where councils found them ineligible, they were referred to the likes of Age UK.', 'The data shows how difficult it is to qualify for care within the shrunken system, states the study.', 'Between 2010 and 2019, total spending on adult social care fell by \u00a386million in real terms, representing a four percent reduction in local authority spending.', 'Ms Abrahams added: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what happens to these older people whose applications are rejected but inevitably some have no choice but to struggle on alone.', '\u201cCouncils do their best with the resources they have but there are simply not enough to go round.', '\u201cReal suffering is going on, with older people\u2019s lives being diminished and, we fear, being cut short.\u201d', 'The budget is up from its low point in 2014/15, but the older and disabled population has risen. This means care spending per head has fallen by six percent per adult over the same time period.', 'Jan Shortt, of the National Pensioner\u2019s Convention, said: \u201cThe chronic underfunding of social care services has caused a crisis that successive governments have failed to understand and deal with.', '\u201cThe only fair way to deal with care is by a national care service, funded through general taxation, free at the point of need and publicly delivered.\u201d Mike Padgham, of the Independent Care Group, said: \u201cThe Age UK statistics are alarming and shame us as a country.', 'Some \u00a38billion has been cut from local authority social care budgets since 2010 so it should not come as a surprise that more older and vulnerable people cannot get the care they need to enjoy a decent quality of life.', '\u201cBoris Johnson promised to sort out social care \u2018once and for all\u2019 when he became Prime Minister but all we have been promised is cross-party talks and a solution within the five years of this Parliament.\u201d",

Collectively that money, which in fact goes down the drain, would more than solve the difficulties of the<b>  elderly</b> people. What does it cost for the House of Lords and only now people are looking at the foreign aid - or are they?
