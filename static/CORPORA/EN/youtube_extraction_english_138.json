And I think it's fascinating the lengths that some women, and many men, will go through to deny that they are -- gasp! -- actually getting older.. . 'She's old, though, isn't she?' a young girl asked me with the same inflection that she might have voiced, 'Oh, but she had a terrible accident, didn't she?' about one of the most powerful editors in New York.'*. . Are women scared to admit their age because of presumed prejudice? Is ageism a real concern? Mandy at XOjane says she's more confident than ever at 37; do you feel more confident now than when you were in your 'prime?' Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian, and Wes Clark Jr. (consultant, veteran) break it down. . . *Read more from Mandy at XOjane:. https://www.xojane.com/beauty/botox-i.... .

Brad Pitt was stunning when younger, but he clearly lost the looks a long time ago. \n\nThere are some guys who still look good when older, but that's precisely because they're the type who don't look like they've aged. Johnny Depp hasn't aged much, for example.",

However, we are not animals&I believe we are here to rise above earthly desires&instead follow our spirit. &there's never a valid excuse for mistreating another person.",
