', 'Ms Thornberry is married to High Court judge Sir Christopher Nugee, and does hold the title of Lady Nugee but goes by her maiden name instead.', 'The Shadow Foreign Secretary complained last year about the use of the name in the House of Commons when the Prime Minister, Theresa May, was even forced to apologise to her.', 'Mrs May said at the time: If the Honourable Lady is concerned about the reference that I made to her, of course I will apologise for that', 'I have to say to her, though, that for the last 36 years I have been referred to by my husband 's name.'",
