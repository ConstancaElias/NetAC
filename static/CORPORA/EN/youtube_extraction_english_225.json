The modern <b> Indian </b>chapatis, made from unleavened whole wheat flour, and Mexican tortillas, made from corn, resemble the breads produced at that time. Between 5000 and 3700 b.c.e. Egypt began organized grain production along the Nile River Valley. At this time bread became a staple food that often was used in trade and barter, and it began to migrate to other cultures.\nAbout 3000 b.c.e., also in Egypt, varieties of wheat that were tougher, that is, more tolerant of weather and environment, were developed. It is widely thought that, owing to the Egyptian skill with brewing beer and the warm climate, wild yeasts attracted to the flour mixtures created the first sourdough. Recognizing the fermentation process, bakers began to experiment and developed the first purposefully leavened breads. By about 2500 b.c.e. the first true sourdoughs were in regular production in the Middle East and Mediterranean regions.\nIn about 2300 b.c.e. the cultivation of grain began in India along the Indus Valley. Around 1500 b.c.e. horses took over the task of plowing and the first iron plowshares were introduced. In about 1000 b.c.e. yeasted breads became popular in Rome. The circular quern, the basis for milling until the Industrial Revolution and the basis for so-called stone-ground flours in the twenty-first century, was developed by about 500 b.c.e. The water mill was invented in Greece around 450 b.c.e. Consequently culinary historians credit the Greeks with ushering in bread baking as an art form.\nIn Rome the first bakers guilds were formed as a means of unifying the craftspeople around 150 b.c.e. Well-to-do Romans insisted on the more exclusive and expensive white breads. Darker whole wheat and bran breads were for the masses, an attitude that persisted well into the twentieth century in Europe and North America. By about 100 c.e. Mexican natives made the first stone-ground corn tortillas. By 300 c.e. the Greeks had developed more than seventy different types of bread, showing their penchant for furthering the bread baking craft. Around 600 c.e. the Persians developed a windmill prototype that changed the face of bread production.",

Is there written proof of what you just wrote?  Ancient literature/writings perhaps documenting their invention and how a commercial industry started?  Books sharing recipes?  Bread making guilds unique to Aboriginals?  Did Aboriginals then share their invention with the rest of the world?  That seems to be what happened in the rest of the world according to world historians as I mentioned above.  Did Aboriginals learn from the world or the world learn  from Aboriginals?  That would have been nice.  Perhaps they did make bread.  Aboriginals had to eat something.  What did they do with their invention?  How did they move on and progress?  Other civilizations built on it, sailed the seas, discovered other continents etc.  The ancient Mayans for example, now long gone were an agricultural society and were known as \"men of corn\".\u00a0 Corn, or as referred to their native language, 'Ixim' was the staple food of the Mayan people, and is nowadays used to make tortillas, tamale, atole, pozole and some types of bread.\u00a0\u00a0Another essential element in the diet of the Mayan people and the main source of protein were beans, which in the native language are called 'bu'ul'. They were mashed and spread onto tortillas to make tacos. The Mayans also prepared and ate beans cooked in soup, used them as flour, and even as a paste for stuffing tamales which were wrapped with 'max\u00e1n' leaves (green leaves with a unique taste).  Others overtook them.",

Anthropologists and nutrition experts who have studied the tribal diet in Arnhem Land found it to be well-balanced, with most of the nutrients modern dietitians recommend. But food was not obtained without effort. In some areas both men and women had to spend from half to two-thirds of each day hunting or foraging for food. Each day, the women of the group went into successive parts of one countryside with wooden digging sticks and plaited dilly bags or wooden coolamons. Larger animals and birds, such as kangaroos and emus, were speared or <b> disabled </b>with a thrown club, boomerang, or stone. Many Indigenous hunting devices were used to get within striking distance of prey. The men were excellent trackers and stalkers, approaching their prey running where there was cover, or 'freezing' and crawling when in the open. They were careful to stay downwind and sometimes covered themselves with mud to disguise their smell. \"  They were comparable to Neolithic societies elsewhere.\nIn some areas mainland Aboriginal Australians also lived in semi-permanent villages, most usually in less arid areas where fishing could provide for a more settled existence. Most Indigenous communities were semi-nomadic, moving in a regular cycle over a defined territory, following seasonal food sources and returning to the same places at the same time each year. From the examination of middens, archaeologists have shown that some localities were visited annually by Indigenous communities for thousands of years. In the more arid areas Aboriginal Australians were nomadic, ranging over wide areas in search of scarce food resources. There is evidence of substantial change in indigenous culture over time.\nAlso, the written evidence was from European settlers.  Aboriginals in Australia failed to develop a written language and progress",

A lot of this money is pay back money for what the Australian government did to the Aboriginals and I think it fairly justified, just like how Germany pays back all the countries it went to war with, Australia pays Aboriginals for all the destruction it caused. Abstudy is trying to educate more and more Aboriginals and rise the education level of Australia as a whole and being more educated increases the chance of getting a job, What do you hate about that? Here is a true fact for you there are more white people living on tax payer's money than Aboriginals.\r\n\n\nAustralia has a highly targeted social security system with support based on family and individual circumstances. The Productivity Commission estimates that 68.5% of the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous expenditure is 'because of greater need, and because of the younger<b>  age</b> profile of the population.'\r\n\n\nMost people below the poverty line in Australia (53%) rely on social security as their main source of income, but most major income support payments sit well below the poverty line.\nThe Commonwealth, state and territory governments spent almost $160 billion on welfare in 2015-16, according to a new report.",

You demand MORE for one<b>  race</b> than ALL the other races in Australia.  You work but your children still get MORE than everyone else and yes me, my children and my grandchildren are forced to PAY through our taxes for YOU.  That i<b> s racis</b>m.  I and mine have to work harder and get less because of it so don't claim to have a wonderful culture when you are a beggar.\n\nAboriginal unemployment stands at 20.6%.  Lazy sods.  This is way above the 5.6% national unemployment.  Getting employment means MORE than just waiting for others to come knocking at your door.  It means getting qualified (without special treatment) like everyone else.  It means waking up every morning to crawl to work.  It means actually working productively.  That's right.  Some Aboriginals work BUT many are a burden.\n\nNow, instead of helping ALL Australians, of eve<b> ry ethnici</b>ty who fail to make the grade to reach that entry bar into choice courses in higher learning, they instead lowered the entry standards for Aboriginals.  This means that a less capable, less hard working, perhaps less intelligent person got into a course instead of the very best.  That is not a good thing.  We could have Aboriginal doctors/nurses who are less than the very best providing a crucial service.  Furthermore, many enrol in Indigenous studies/Aboriginal studies.  Will multi national companies want to employ people who are good in oh <b> say </b>dot painting or learning to speak a language/dialect which has no international commercial use instead of accountants, commerce/business, engineering, mining, mathematics graduates?  No.  So tax payer money is once again thrown at Aboriginals creating imaginary jobs for them. ONLY Aboriginals can be employed as Aboriginal Liaison Officers.  What about Scott<b> ish, In</b>dian, Chinese liaison officers?  In Australia, there is also a phrase \"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are encouraged to apply\".  It often means that entry requirements are lowered to get Aboriginals into employment.  The best person should get the job irrespecti<b> ve of ethn</b><b> icity</b>, <b> race</b> or sex.  That is not a good thing.  Life is hard and getting harder.  We should ALL be treated EQUALLY irrespe<b> ctive of e</b<b> >thni</b>city/race/skin colour and may the B<b> EST ma</b>n or woman win.

How do you expect me to respect any Aboriginal when I KNOW that many got in because they ticked the \"Are you Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander\" box? I can't except perhaps you.  When I saw the Westpac Aboriginals on television, I KNEW they got the job because they were Aboriginals.  The job was created just for them and better qualified, cleverer and harder working other races couldn't even apply.  WTF.  I can't respect that.    I mean some Indians are darker than Aboriginals,  the Chinese were forever the \"<b> yel<b> low<b>  </b</b</b>>>peril\" and you know what they went through.  The Vietnamese came here at the tail end of the white Australia policy.  They were the enemy, even the South Vietnamese and were called Viet Cong, VC.  They looked different, had a different culture, went through years of war, death and suffering and saw family members murdered and didn't speak English.  Yet they opened small shops, worked 16 hours a day to make ends meet, had their shop windows smashed but still educated their children to fit into mainstream Australia.  Aboriginals can do no less.",

I know its not easy.  It would be very tempting for anyone to just take.  Life is hard and getting harder.    Problem is, like I said, people might keep quiet BUT we see and we know.  My child will lose out because someone else got something on the basis of <b> race.</b>  The problem is how would we know that Aboriginal in the course/job got it the same way as the rest of us (like yourself) and not just because they could simply write their name.  I hate saying stuff like this to someone like you but that is what most people think in private and when political correctness is not on show. <b>  Nobody</b>, bu<b> t nobod</b>y, even the racists thinks the Asian doctor didn't earn their place the hard way.",

This is my opinion about this whole <b> racist </b>comments thing that's going on here, being a white European man myself.\n\nDon't forget that pretty much all white people originate from the Europeans, and for which it could have been your own family ancestors who did these things... Pretty hypocritical if you blame the Europeans for this now. \n\nI think, the reason why they did these horrible things ( I think) all descendants feel ashamed and guilty about, is all about power. Because mankind has a brutal lust for power. \nIf you look at the way the world developed during it's history, you can see that Europe was the most developed part of the earths population. If they would go out exploring to other parts of the earth, where they are not as developed as you were, then the people rightfully living there are very vulnerable. Men seeking fortune and power probably saw this as an easy way of getting that.\n\nMankind has always wanted to explore the world, or the unknown. That could be a big reason why they went and explored the world. \n\nI'm not trying to say what the colonizers, like: Britain, France, Germany and The Netherlands did was okay, and that it should have been this way... But this made them the most powerful part of the world for a very long time...\n\nEven now, the Americans (which are also Europeans) still have a huge influence on how the world turns. \n\nI think what we need to do is look to the past with an understanding of the mistakes we've made,  and do it better while we get our short time on this earth. Let's learn from our mistakes, and not let them happen again. \n\nI think that this doesn't mean that the men who live here now need to be punished for the stupid leaders of the past. We can not change the past. That is a fact. So let's be happy that we are living in a world that knows the most peace in our history.",

Bess Nungarrayi Price, in her foreword to Jarrett's book, says, 'My own body is scarred by domestic violence...We Aboriginal people have to acknowledge the truth. We can't blame all of our problems on the white man...This is our problem that we can fix ourselves\u2026'... Paleopathologist Stephen Webb in 1995 published his analysis of 4500 individuals' bones from mainland Australia going back 50,000 years. (Priceless bone collections at the time were being officially handed over to Aboriginal communities for re-burial, which stopped follow-up studies).[15\"> Webb found highly disproportionate rates of injuries and fractures to women's skulls, with the injuries suggesting deliberate attack and often attacks from behind, perhaps in domestic squabbles. In the tropics, for example, female head-injury frequency was about 20-33%, versus 6.5-26% for males. The most extreme results were on the south coast, from Swanport and Adelaide, with female cranial trauma rates as high as 40-44% -- two to four times the rate of male cranial trauma. In desert and south coast areas, 5-6% of female skulls had three separate head injuries, and 11-12% had two injuries. Web could not rule out women-on-women attacks but thought them less probable.  Don't blame whites.  Aboriginal violence was endemic pre European contact.",

Pretty hypocritical if you blame the Europeans for this now. \n\nI think it is all about power. Because mankind has a brutal lust for power. If you look at the way the world developed then, you can see that Europe was the most developed part of the earths population. If you would go out to other parts of the earth, where they are not as developed as you were, then that is an easy way of getting: more money, more power, ... \n\nMankind has always wanted to explore the world, or the unknown. That could be a big reason why they went and explored the world. \n\nI'm not trying to say what the colonizers like Britain, France, Germany and The Netherlands did was normal, and that it should have been this way... But this made them the most powerful part of the world for a very long time... Even now, the Americans (which are also Europeans who murdered a whole <b> race)</b> still have a huge influence on how the world turns. \n\nI think what we need to do is look to the past with an understanding of what a horrible thing we did. But this doesn't mean that the men who live there now need to be punished for the stupid leaders of the past? We can not change the past. That is a fact. So let's be happy that we are living in a world that knows the most peace in our history.",

            "commentText": "Russ Pearson.  Here we see the true Aboriginal spirit, demanding MORE than ALL other Australians of ALL ethnicities without working.  Gimme, gimme, gimme but don't want to work or pay for what you want.  Instead of proudly saying, I will work and pay my way in life, you personify Aboriginality as it stands today, a culture of demanding and begging for what others work hard for.  Australians of non English speaking backgrounds of all races work 16 hours a day to make ends meet.  They then scrimp and save to educate their children to join mainstream Australia and contribute to society.  You on the other hand threaten hard working people, want what they work hard for but refuse to pay your way.  You are a professional victim.  In 50 years, we will still be having this conversation and everybody else will still have to pay for you.  A <b> racist </b>is someone who demands MORE on the basis of his race/ethnicity/skin colour.  That Russ is YOU.  You're the<b>  racist</b>.  You're th<b> e bu</b>m.  You're the person living off the hard work of other Australians.",

Crime is a significant social issue in Alice Springs. Alice Springs has the highest crime rate of any Australian city, with raw crime numbers higher than Darwin, a city with three times the population and a record of high crime. Violent crime in the town in 2010 was at unprecedented levels and \"out of control\". Alice Springs is the nation's murder capital and one of the most dangerous towns in Australia The level of crime has had a major impact on the town's tourist industry with tourists from several countries being warned to avoid the town or take extra precautions. Most violent crime in Alice Springs is between Aboriginal people too.  Now no doubt you've heard of ATSIC, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.  They voted their leaders in, ran programs paid for by Australian tax payers and then ran it into the ground with a good dose of gang rapes, fraud and embezzlement thrown in  until it was dismantled.  In 2016, Indigenous Australians were still nearly 13 times more likely to be unemployed (at a rate of 33.3%) than non-Indigenous Australians (2.6%).  Time to treat Aboriginals as EQUALS, time to encourage them to actually join the mainstream community which is BTW a myriad of people of ALL cultures, ethnicities and races, all of whom are working side by side with one another.  Time for people like yourself to stop looking down on Aboriginals and expecting them to fail  When I see an Aboriginal, I see a man or a <b> woman </b>who can compete with me on EQUAL terms.  Life is not easy.  I believe in Aboriginals because they are the same as me.",

You work but your children still get MORE than everyone else and yes me, my children and my grandchildren are forced to PAY through our taxes for YOU.  That is<b>  racism</b>.  I and mine have to work harder and get less because of it so don't claim to have a wonderful culture when you are a beggar.\n\n\nAboriginal unemployment stands at 20.6%.  Lazy sods.  This is way above the 5.6% national unemployment.  Getting employment means MORE than just waiting for others to come knocking at your door.  It means getting qualified (without special treatment) like everyone else.  It means waking up every morning to crawl to work.  It means actually working productively.  That's right.  Some Aboriginals work BUT many are a burden.\n\n\n\nNow, instead of helping ALL Australians, of ever<b> y ethnicit</b>y who fail to make the grade to reach that entry bar into choice courses in higher learning, they instead lowered the entry standards for Aboriginals.  This means that a less capable, less hard working, perhaps less intelligent person got into a course instead of the very best.  That is not a good thing.  We could have Aboriginal doctors/nurses who are less than the very best providing a crucial service.  Furthermore, many enrol in Indigenous studies/Aboriginal studies.  Will multi national companies want to employ people who are good in oh s<b> ay d</b>ot painting or learning to speak a language/dialect which has no international commercial use instead of accountants, commerce/business, engineering, mining, mathematics graduates?  No.  So tax payer money is once again thrown at Aboriginals creating imaginary jobs for them. ONLY Aboriginals can be employed as Aboriginal Liaison Officers.  What about Scotti<b> sh, Ind</b>ian, Chinese liaison officers?  In Australia, there is also a phrase \"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are encouraged to apply\".  It often means that entry requirements are lowered to get Aboriginals into employment.  The best person should get the job irrespectiv<b> e of ethni</b><b> city,</b> r<b> ace </b>or sex.  That is not a good thing.  Life is hard and getting harder.  We should ALL be treated EQUALLY irrespec<b> tive of et</b<b> >hnic</b>ity/race/skin colour and may the BE<b> ST man</b> or woman win.

Honestly, we can learn sooo much about Indigenous peoples and their beautiful culture. \nAustralia does not \"belong\" to anyone, it was stolen.

For example have a look educational benefits.  There is  Austudy (for all Australians and which have to be paid back) vs Abstudy (ONLY available for Aboriginals) which have a lot MORE money giveaway components which don't have to be paid back.  Also look up Aboriginal Housing Victoria (ONLY for Aboriginals) and Victorian Aboriginal Health Services (desperately needed dental but was told to go away as it was ONLY for Aboriginals.).  In Australia, if anyone wants something, they work for it.  There is <b> nothing </b>to stop Aboriginals from doing the same.  For example many Indians are darker than Aboriginals.  You see them manning the 7/11 stores, delivering bread and cleaning shops in the early hours of the morning to make ends meet AND then go on to educate their children to fit into mainstream society.  I used to tell my children that if they wanted something to work hard for it because perseverance, dedication and individual intelligence counted and would get them what they wanted.  Perhaps now we should tell our children that even if they really, truly wanted to get a position, (educational or work), don't bother because an Aboriginal will get it because of their ethnicity/skin colour/race even if we or our children worked our hearts out to achieve.  Boy that is truly<b>  racism</b>.  Oh and I ask for EQUALITY and you call me a loser and <b> a racis</b>t.  Guess who might be t<b> he raci</b>st?",

                    "commentText": "@Anon AnonStephanie Jarrett, in her introduction to 'Liberating Aboriginal People from Violence, says, 'It is important to acknowledge [the\"> link between today's Aboriginal violence and violent, pre-contact tradition, because until policymakers are honest in their assessment of the causes, Aboriginal people can never be liberated from violence...Deep cultural change is necessary, away from traditional norms and practices of violence.' Bess Nungarrayi Price, in her foreword to Jarrett's book, says, 'My own body is scarred by domestic violence...We Aboriginal people have to acknowledge the truth. We can't blame all of our problems on the white man...This is our problem that we can fix ourselves\u2026'... Paleopathologist Stephen Webb in 1995 published his analysis of 4500 individuals' bones from mainland Australia going back 50,000 years. (Priceless bone collections at the time were being officially handed over to Aboriginal communities for re-burial, which stopped follow-up studies).[15\"> Webb found highly disproportionate rates of injuries and fractures to women's skulls, with the injuries suggesting deliberate attack and often attacks from behind, perhaps in domestic squabbles. In the tropics, for example, female head-injury frequency was about 20-33%, versus 6.5-26% for males. The most extreme results were on the south coast, from Swanport and Adelaide, with female cranial trauma rates as high as 40-44% -- two to four times the rate of male cranial trauma. In desert and south coast areas, 5-6% of female skulls had three separate head injuries, and 11-12% had two injuries.",

But I make an effort to know whose land I'm living on, and respect our lands custodians. I've seen Australian Aborigines at their best, in every sport and business imaginable, i've had 1 on 1 guides at Uluru and Carnarvon Gorge, and am thrilled at how well they're looking after our national parks. But I've also seen the dry riverbed at night in Alice Springs, I've seen a toddler held by the foot and head swung against concrete as punishment by the childs mother, have watched first hand street battles and family disputes over murders that go back and forth generations back no one remembered who started the fight, and you aboriginies keep having loud vocal disputes on public streets, never quite understood why. And the violence. The violence. But never in history had two such different civilizations met, and somehow Australia is working out as a country. But it's time to pull ya bootstraps up. Think you buggers got it hard, look at West Papua.",

My children will lose out to someone with lower marks, less/lower/perhaps no qualifications, less dedication, less individual intelligence.  That is not a good thing both for the individual and for society as a whole. Aboriginals also get way more in terms of Austudy (for all Australians) v Abstudy (ONLY for Aboriginals).  Much of what Aboriginals get in Abstudy are in the form of grants which do not have to be paid back.  Furthermore, Abstudy also funds Aboriginals for their masters and doctrate degrees.   The struggles of my children in life are just as important as any Aboriginals struggle.   I will always fight for my children and in the future for my grandchildren.

As I have mentioned, look up the Woolworths or Westpac indigenous employment schemes.  Other examples are Aboriginal Liaison Officers in government  departments (there are no Scottish Liaison officer, no <b> Indian </b>Liaison officers, no Chinese Liaison Officers etc.  These are \"created\" jobs just for Aboriginals.  Another example is the Aboriginal Rangers.  One<b>  race</b>?  seriously?   It should be open to all races and the person with the best qualification should get the job.  Apart from all that, these schemes do a great amount of damage to people like you.  Australians don't know if Aboriginals got their jobs through the back door or like you fair and square.  Sorry but they're simply facts.  I actually work with an Aboriginal who like you got into university on his own merits and also works part time to support himself.  I have the greatest respect for him.  You take care too.",

The British settlers were soon followed by others from Europe and Asia bringing with them varieties of bacteria and viruses that the Australian aboriginals had not contracted before.   There would also have been conflict between settlers and Aboriginals.  The technologically poor Aboriginals lost.  Between disease and warfare, Aboriginal society was in full retreat.

                    "commentText": "since the very first white man landed in Australia it has always been against the law to harm any aboriginal. do some research. Govoner Phillip was in charge of the new collony and since the first day they landed, he said it is the same laws for harming white people as it is for anyone that harms an Aboriginal. And There has never been a time in Australian history when the law was any different. He even built a house for an Aboriginal man Bennelong (where the opera house sits today) and named it Bennelong point. \n Even in tasmania the government was constatly trying to stop the  Aboriginies from fighting with the farmers. the farmers had guns so they always won the fight. The Government even hung posters around the tasmanian bush to show the aboriginals that \"we are your friends\" . you can look up and see the posters online. you have been brainwashed.",

                    "commentText": "Sienna Sticher ... I have done some research for you. \nScientific and historical facts\nThe first Homo sapiens who lived in Australia walked from the north about 50,000 years ago - because there was land to walk on. The first human migration to Australia was achieved when this landmass formed part of the Sahul continent, connected to the island of New <b> Guinea </b>via a land bridge. Over time these land bridges were covered by ocean due to normal tectonic plate movement and rising sea levels. Hence the Homo sapiens who inhabited the continent of Australia about 40,000-50,000 years ago (the ancestors of current Australian aborigines) became cut off from the Homo sapiens on the other parts of the planet. \nAfter they were cut-off, the human tribes in Australia fought each other and many tribes slaughtered the males of other tribes. The Australian aboriginals were particularly bloodthirsty and cruel. The normal process of inter-tribal fighting means that males are usually killed while females are kept alive to bear the children of the victorious tribe.\nThe humans who occupied the rest of the planet had similar inter-tribal warfare but there was a much greater variety of humans who were competing with each other. On the large continents, humans evolved and changed due to a great deal of natural competition. Stronger more intelligent human groups resulted. Over many thousands of years the successful groups dominated and incorporated their genes with other stronger groups. This is a simplification of course but it explains observations.\nHumans across the planet (except for those in Australia and other inaccessible locations), they developed agriculture and better tools and instruments. This caused them to flourish. As their numbers increased, diseases evolved which killed many of these humans. The survivors had more active immune systems as well as better skills in cognitive thought. Humans became better at living co-operatively.  \n * * *\nIf Australia had NOT been cut off by the ocean, stronger, more intelligent humans would have dominated and killed the males of the Australian tribes. They would have assimilated some of the genes from the females many thousands of years ago. \nThe overall result is that mainstream humans with a higher intelligence and stronger immune systems spread across the planet, except for places which were inaccessible, such as Australia. The humans in Australia remained stone<b> -age</b> tribes who had not yet invented the wheel. On a scale where the average European human has an IQ of 100, the natives of Australia have an IQ of about 64. By the modern Australian standard, the majority of pure aboriginals are well below the medically defined level fo<b> r menta</b>l retardation, thus they qualify for special medical benefits the same as oth<b> er handicapp</b>ed people. Recognising that the natives had little organisation and had developed only simple stone tools, the British colonists saw Australia as unoccupied. \nWhen the British arrived to colonise Australia in 1788 they carried with them diseases which the st<b> one-</b>age Australian aboriginal immune system was not adapted to. The settlers would have been unaware of this. Viruses and bacteria were not known about at that time. Human hosts would have been completely unaware they were carrying diseases dangerous to Australian natives. The British settlers were soon followed by others from Europe and Asia bringing with them varieties of bacteria and viruses that the Australian aboriginals had not contracted before. This was the main cause of \u2018aboriginal' death. An aboriginal living in those early days needed to stay well away from the settlers and some settlers helped to facilitate this.\nThere were hundreds of tribes and about 250 different primitive languages. The tribes were very bloodthirsty towards each other. Some may have been killed by settlers in self-defence but killing aborigines was illegal and called murder by British law.\nMost of the full aboriginals died after colonisation because the humans who came to Australia unknowingly brought in diseases, such as bubonic plague, chickenpox, hepatitis, tetanus, cholera,<b>  the co</b>mmon cold, diphtheria, influenza, malaria, measles, scarlet fever, sexually transmitted diseases, polio, typhoid, typhus, tuberculosis, and pertussis (whooping cough), etc.\nThe only reason any full aboriginals are alive and healthy is because of white people developed antibiotics and vaccines. White people have been looking after the full aboriginals in their remote settlements.\n * * *\nHumans reached Tasmania approximately 40,000 years ago by migrating across a land bridge from the mainland that existed during the las<b> t ic</b>e age. After the seas rose about 12,000 years ago and covered the land bridge, the inhabitants there were isolated from the mainland until the arrival of European settlers. The settler's history is particularly well detailed by historic documents. The death of these aboriginals due to disease is particularly well described. The European settlers tried to isolate them to protect them from diseases. There is NO evidence of mass killings or genocide.\n* * *\nAfter colonisation, many of the Australian aboriginals who survived the diseases mixed their genes with the colonists and many <b> \u2018mixe</b>d race' humans have resulted. They are still called \u2018aboriginals'.\nThere are a small number of \u2018pure' aboriginals still in existence in the warmer parts of Australia. They are generally quiet and prefer to live in remote, isolated locations. They are cared for and survive because of the health care system in place to look after them. Antibiotics have had an important role.\nThe large amount of government funding assigned to aboriginal healthcare allows th<b> e mix</b>ed race aboriginals to thrive. The avera<b> ge mi</b>xed race aboriginal female has more than 6 children. As expected there are major problems with drug abuse <b> and chi</b>ld sexual abuse. Most do not have the skills to be gainfully employed so most have very little to do and they suffer from boredom.\nThere are <b> many </b>mixed-race aboriginals who are termed \u2018aboriginals'. The more vocal and assertive of them tend to have characteristics of Europeans and have a family tree that is mostly European. Some of <b> these</b> mixed-race aboriginals become \u2018aboriginal activists' who try to propagate the idea that \u2018invading whites' have taken over their country. For example, an aboriginal documentary video on YouTube has written comments such as: \n'Our blood is mixed with many who have sought our Land, and our shade of skin is varied, but our hearts will always be true.' \nThe writer of this sentence is part aboriginal but is mostly of European or Asian in background. The writer wants to claim that Australia is his/her land. This is taken seriously by the media even though the family tree of the \u2018aboriginal activists' demonstrates that the activists themselves are \u2018invading whites' -- the very group that they profess to be subjugated by. Some \u2018aboriginals' even have blue eyes.\nThe leftist media supports the false victim mentality of aboriginals and propagates a myth of poor colonist treatment of aboriginals. The elite, globalist, Jewish billionaires who own the mainstream media, instruct journalists and editors to do this. They want to discredit white national identity as much as they can. People shouldn't be fooled by this. Migrants come to live in a white-built country for a reason. \nElite Jews want to spread propaganda that white countries are somehow 'illegal' or 'illegitimate' -- this is to allow their globalist takeover to take place more easily. Bringing in hoards of foreigners (Islamists from the Middle East and Africa) who hate Australia is part of the globalist agenda.\nThe globalist agenda has been explained in two videos, titled:  What Is a Globalist? and The Globalist Agenda Explained.\n\u2018Aboriginal' activists exaggerate for political reasons \u2013 to gain more government funding and special treatment.",

I feel the whole out of africa theory is just pure rubbish. I dont buy in to it, i think there is enough evidence to suggest that several groups of modern humans may well have developed in different parts of the world at virtualy the same time. I look at pictures of aboriginal people both today and from 100 years past and i cant see a lot of similarities , ( between us and africans ) , but i can see a hell of a lot of differences, skin colour being one.",

I am amazed that the origins of man can be such a divisive subject , based on sheer ignorance and racial discrimination. Aboriginal people are much maligned even in our own country. The conditions many of our  (remote) people live in is absolutely deplorable, and an outsider is easily mislead looking at face value. Even though i am a product of the welfare era , notorious for the forced removal of children, ( the stolen generation),  I am proud to be a descendant of the oldest most complex people to have ever walked this planet . We have full totally fucked the whole biblical narrative, with our longevity in aust, currently believed to be in the vacinity of 60 000+ years,cause we miraculously survived the biblical flood, several ice ages and have proven many an expert anthropologist wrong with the complexity of our seemingly primative culture. I try to make these points , to those who wish to hear. I am no expert on all things korri, I can only talk from what i know and what i have lived. I have tried to educate myself about the condition of my people , and our cultural heritage. I might add that i often remark to these <b> racist </b>arseholes who like to spread ignorance , hate and make vitriolic comments about us , to take a<b>  hike</b> out to the great australian desert, in his undies with a bottle of water and a spear , see how long he lasts out there. 50\u00b0 heat, no water , no shade, no one but animals like dingoes, goanna's , snakes , ants eagles, all ready and waitin to feast on yor carcass as yu die. When he is dyin of thirst , starvation and sun stroke ,  he will be praying that som<b> e blac</b>k fella or tracker , comes trottin out of the desert haze and finds him , before the elements claimed him. Cause the chances are no white fella with half a brain would try his luck out in that scorching hot no mans land. Or yu can read up on the early aussie explorers, and see how they fared without local aboriginal knowledge of the land. Quite a few of them perished because they were ignorant and complacent about the harsh reality of the aussie bush. Quite a few owe their salvation to the local blackfella's who were treated miserably in many cases for their benevolence, and saving them from certain death.",

Gimme, gimme, gimme but don't want to work or pay for what you want.  Instead of proudly saying, I will work and pay my way in life, you personify Aboriginality as it stands today, a culture of demanding and begging for what others work hard for.  Australians of non English speaking backgrounds of all races work 16 hours a day to make ends meet.  They then scrimp and save to educate their children to join mainstream Australia and contribute to society.  You on the other hand threaten hard working people, want what they work hard for but refuse to pay your way.  You are a professional victim.  In 50 years, we will still be having this conversation and everybody else will still have to pay for you.  A <b> racist </b>is someone who demands MORE on the basis of his race/ethnicity/skin colour.  That Russ is YOU.  You're the<b>  racist</b>.  You're th<b> e bu</b>m.  You're the person living off the hard work of other Australians.",
