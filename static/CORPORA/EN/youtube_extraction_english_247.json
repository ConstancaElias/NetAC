We left at<b>  the</b> old adage of whe<b> n th</b>e old white lady clutch is her purse in the presenc<b> e of a</b> black man. That's not funny, that'<b> s true</b>. Black folks are bullies and have a high propensity for violence and crime and that's why these white folks for us. We have to change our behavior in order to get other races to have a better perspective of us. Because right now when they see us all they see is a criminal and somebody that may harm them. The answer lies within us. It's time for us to face the facts and get ourselves straight and then people will stop fearing us so much. But we have to prove it to them...  We made this mess, now we have to fix it.",

And generally during the Second World War the Japanese did some really barbaric stuff. However, today if Japanese people move to a community outside their native country, the people living there don't start moving out. My point is that whites stereotype <b> black </b>people based on particular behaviours and measurable trends. That does a huge disservice to<b>  black</b> people who don't indulge in crime, etc. But people inevitable  stereotype groups in order to navigate the world. It's not always fair but it is that way. I live in london and while not all young white males with pit bulls, smoking skunk on street corners are a threat, enough are that something in my brain kicks in and says 'maybe walk the other way'. Stereotypes don't randomly come out o<b> f thi</b>n air. It's sad but it is true",

These same people are always in the news for robbery. These same people are the ones that are publically known for certain crimes. Common-sense would dictate that you will be very CAUTIOUS around them. \n\nAsians: Science, Math, Martial Arts ------- Blacks: Crime, Drugs, Murder, Robbery ------------------------- WHY????     It's not fair but there is some truth in it, that's how it becomes a stereotype in the first place.\n\nI'm a <b> black </b>man, born & raised in USA! I served in the Armed forces etc. etc.  This is my take.<b> \nBlack</b> people for instance that are opposed to Christianity are always those who truly have no true knowledge of the Word itself. You can use it as an excuse, but truth be told, one of the real downfalls of th<b> e blac</b>k community came about in the 80's wh<b> en bla</b>ck neighborhoods were flooded with this new drug called \"CRACK\" cocaine that devastated <b> the bl</b>ack community & family. We have 3 generations of crack babies & children raised by their grandparents. Not to mention the fact that because this generation lost the respect factor for elders that used to be an intricate part of<b>  the b</b>lack fa<b> mily. </b>Black men are primarily rai<b> sed by</b> black women that are basically lost and devoid of the education and ability to <b> raise </b>a black son alone. They produce feminine and sof<b> t-mind</b>ed black men who have no true direction due to lack of true k<b> nowled</b>ge. Black<b>  women</b> say black men are terrible but who primarily r<b> aised </b>them? Black women. I'm not<b>  bashi</b>ng all black women, I'm simply stating a trut<b> h. As </b>long as black people stay in a state of confusion and refuse to love one another truly, we as a people will always remain at the bottom of progress. Africa is predominate<b> ly com</b>posed of black people, why are they being controlled <b> by eve</b>ryone but black people? Africa is worse than America in so many ways as it<b>  perta</b>ins to the black man, that's why so many come to America. Wake up & realize that in order to gain control, you must first realize sel<b> f, lov</b>e your wife black man. The bible says a man is to R<b> ESPECT</b<b> > his </b>wife! A black woman will love you if you TRULY love her! Raise your children in that love & build<b>  a new</b> generation of black men & women that truly live respe<b> cting </b>self and fellow black people and all people. Anything less than that is producing more crabs in a barrel!  PEACE",

Your opinion is flawed, what gives you the right to say all <b> black </b>people are 'stuped' when you've yet to meet every single<b>  black</b> person in the world and analyze their IQ. By your words I'm able to say all white people are ignorant because I've never met a non ignorant white person. Ivan Van Sertima, Amos Wilson, and Walter Rodney.

Listen, if you call out a <b> race </b>for being stupid at least have the decency to sound like you have at the very most a basic 95 IQ. From your sentences-'How much<b>  black</b> scientist you know.' And '99<b> % blac</b>k are stuped' you sound as if you're a five ye<b> ar o</b>ld trying to write simple sentences. Also, 1<b> 00% bl</b>ack? Everyone is mixed with something so the small amount of people that are <b> pure b</b>lack is close to nonexistent which raises the question of who exactly are you talking to? It can't be the blacks of America because most if not all are mixed<b>  with I</b>ndian or etc. In which case you're statement filled with grammar errors of a fiv<b> e ye</b>ar old is pretty much irrelevant. But anyway I hope you have a blessed day sense this conversation isn't going anywhere except in one of your ears and out the other. I hope one day you'll be able to state your opinion better and maybe learn how to spell as well while you're at it. You can also comment back if you want just know that it more than likely won't be seen by me sense unlike a lot of people I actually have things to do and a life to live. Good day\ud83d\ude0a.",

I'm a vegetarian once in public the lady who was serving me said \"would you like the chicken?\" and I said \"no I'm a vegetarian\" She replied \"oh\" as if that really surprised her. I won't even go on about the times i was in public with my boyfriend holding hands and people whipped out their phones and pointed them in our direction.

With all the anti discrimination laws out there and  the fact that it is easier for blacks to get into schools these days just because of their skin color, shows that the world is literally handing blacks a get out of the ghetto free card, but instead of working hard and applying themselves, seems they'd rather be a bunch a gangbangers who steal and deal drugs within their own communities continuing the endless cycle of violence and poverty. And even though white people created these laws and literally fought and died to give <b> black </b>people a chance, they want to continue to play the victim and get hand outs even though at this point in time America is a country that runs on a merit system and if u work hard and apply yourself u can succeed, regardless of skin color. And if u can prove that u didn't get a job or a promotion or a bank loan because of ur skin color, u can sue the shit of them, as long as u can prove it.",

Quit making excuses for people stealing and doing/selling drugs. It ain't the white mans fault anymore, maybe it was but it sure as shit isn't anymore.

No one forced u to sell whatever is in the crate. No one forced u to give up on school. No one forced u to sell/carry the drugs that u had on u when u got caught by the cops. No one forced u to run from the cops. I have no sympathy for anyone who makes their life from crime, gangbangers, mob, yakuza, pimps, u should all be shot in the streets and burned in front of people to make a point.

Not that any of this applies to me, I'm <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>so no children in my future. Anyways, as I keep saying, it all comes down to a choice. It doesn't matter how poor and neglected u were as a child, how discriminated u were because of ur skin color, or how low ur intelligence is, at some point these people chose to break the law and then when it was over they justified it and continued breaking the law. I remember something that stuck with from the first and as far as I am concerned, only Tales From The Hood, the third tale is all about <b> a blac</b>k gangbanger who shoots and kills some oth<b> er bla</b>ck gangbangers. He gets into this rehabilitation program and his doctor says something, ' It's up to you to change things, it's up to you TO BREAK THIS CYCLE!!!' Then at the end she asks him 'Who is responsible for your life. Your mother, your father, your teachers, THE WORLD?! No you made your choices. Now you have to live them.' Any of this getting through at all!!!!",

So by their own admission being a gangbanger is a part of<b>  black</b> culture. Now before I get the typical responses, what do they do at pimp and hoe parties. They wear baggy ass clothes<b> , tack</b>y gold chains, drink 40s in brown paper bags and listen to shitty gangsta rap. What do gangbangers do? They wear baggy ass clothe<b> s, tac</b>ky gold chains, drink 40s in brown paper bags and listen to shitty gangsta rap. That is what the sjw identity politic playing asshats r claiming is pur<b> ely bl</b>ack people behavior. And cultural appropriation is bullshit anyways, it's a term made by a bunch of white hating bigots who don't realize that the political forces r using the sjw outrage as a tool to get unamerican censorship laws passed.

He asked why <b> black </b>people consider the violent gang oriented part of the<b>  black</b> communit<b> y blac</b>k culture. I cannot speak for t<b> he bla</b>ck community but I am going to take a guess that not <b> all bl</b>ack people embrace or even consider thug behavior part of their culture. I'm sure other people like thugs would Identify with this but reasonable people might not. You gave some vague reasons as to WHY the community may have developed these behaviors. And on that note I wholeheartedly agree<b>  the b</b>lack community has not been treated well. Thankfully recently things are much different. I have seen impoverished youth i<b> n the </b>black community make the change in their lives and break free of the cycle of crime and violence. I think to make this a reality the first thing is to realize we cannot excuse our behavior, own our faults and have to face them head on. Selling hard drugs lends itself to a dark world of the worst of human behavior. Why on earth would you want to invite the behavior of addicts into you life? The begging, stealing, killing, hig<b> h ri</b>sk sex and tra<b> ding</b> of sex, and more. The only reason is they are being taught by their elders, community, music, and environment that this is the way. Hopefully it will change someday, but it might not considering how ingrained a lot of this is. A boy growing up rarely seeing his father and when he does he is watching him cut up dope on a table and him and mom are bagging it up. These are powerful images and lessons to a child, they help shape and build his core beliefs. A proactive effort is needed to stop this unhealthy lesson that violence and crime are any kind of life choice. Yes things have been unfair. No it is not just a product of oppression and sy<b> stemati</b>c racism. There has been choice involved. Make a a better choice. The better choice might not be the easiest or fastest money but piece by piece better choices lead to a better life.",

Murder is harder to prove than a drug case, so murderers often get offered plea agreements. Part of plea agreement means admitting what u did and confessing in front of judge. It's like the lynchpin of the whole process. Now, since drugs cases r open and shut, u get caught with drugs on u, u go to jail. The plea agreement there is usually tell me who sold the drugs and u get less time. But in the<b>  black</b> community that gets labeled a snitch and u lose all ur street cred right? Can't be having that now can we. Or u can try the always substantiated and always true argument of the cops or someone else must have planted it on me defense. But that gambit comes with a max sentence if u get found guilty. But what it all boils down to in my mind is, there r certain people who refuse to accept reality when they get offered a plea bargain, they refuse it on the belief that the judge or jury will buy whatever bullshit story they tell them, and then they cry conspiracy when they get found guilty. No, that isn't al<b> l blac</b>k people, not even a<b> ll bla</b>ck people who get arrested, but a realistic number would be about 85%<b>  of bl</b>ack people who have been found guilty since the year 2000. But once again Cash, u still think that's it ok to open random crates of drugs and guns in the street and decide to sell them to ur community rather call someone, the cops, the local news, the fire department, someone who can start an investigation into who is leaving the phantom crates.

Back in the<b>  old</b> days and in th<b> e ol</b>d country, the mob was more trustworthy and seen as  necessary thing. But then they stared getting greedy and the organization turned into what is today, an organization filled with lazy assholes who would rather take the easy way out and get rich by extortion, murder, drugs, etc. than get a real job. And whenever one of these assholes is killed or put away, I see it as a good thing for the world, because animals who break the law deserve jail. They chose a life of crime and deserve whatever happens to them. See what I did there? I answered the question by saying y it's considered part of Italian culture, not white culture though since u have to be pure Italian to be a full fledged member, explained when the organization turned into what it is without assigning blame on anyone else but the idiots in the mob, and then I condemned the mob. Something that only a handful of blacks, Ya Boy Cash not being one of them, seem to be capable of. It's their own damn fault they r a bunch of criminals, and if I ever saw them committing a crime, I would risk my head on a chopping block to put them away. Yep, I would, will, and have snitched on a criminal. Because I care about my community and about the future of my species. Humans.",

The mob is more successful because they don't just target random people and houses on a whim. The mob studies where and when they attack. They run better rackets, they offer better protection, they r better at being criminals. This doesn't excuse their behavior and they all deserve to be ass raped in prison, but they have a less flashy way of going about breaking the law. And of course u se<b> e racis</b>m every where u go, because u WANT to s<b> ee raci</b>sm everywhere u go. People like u need to <b> see rac</b>ism everywhere so u can continue to go on blaming everything wrong in ur life on the corrupt and evil white man. U refuse to believe that even after all the hand outs and government programs and private charities dedicated to hel<b> ping b</b>lack people make something out of themselves that maybe, just maybe, a lot of ur problems come from within ur own communities and not from an external force. Is the government corrupt, fuck yea it is, but it created all the welfare and food stamp programs that a lot of people, all colors, have come to depend on for survival. Is <b> there r</b>acism in the the police force, yea, but not nearly as much as people like u would have us believe. U know y cops catch more crimin<b> als in</b> black neighborhoods than in upper class, rich bitch, neighborhoods, once again, because they r better at being discreet along with the clientele. And finally, don't bitch about my spelling, this is a fucking YouTube comment section, I'm not writing a paper on quantum particles for a god damned science publication. U can at least understand what I'm going for, u got enough to respond with ur we ain't victims ur a<b> ll just</b> racist rant.",

It's very, very simple. Change your culture into an education focused culture and you will prosper. Keep up with this victimhood mentality and you will stay poor. Because as much as pathetic white liberals love to whip themselves for their ancestors sins, it always stops when the rubber meets the road and they wont actually give up their money for you.  Reparations wont ever happen, so what is the end goal anyways? If ultra liberal whites wont give you their money now, you know damn sure sane whites wont ever do it. So your only option is to succeed in the business world.  We can give you handouts like welfare and AA, but those wont change much beyond a small percentage point.  Keep waiting on a handout and you will starve, people are tired of carrying you",

I do not possess any accent, nor do I listen to hip hop, things people apply when stereotyping us, but I honor m<b> y africa</b>n american heritage by learning of and appreciating my slave ancestors. But Im always reminded, everytime a white person crosses the street as I come near them, everytime they lock their car door multiple times as I walk near their car, that I am still just some potential criminal to them. Doesnt matter how well I dress. White people are hateful people.",

You are claiming a victimhood status and ignoring what other people might be going through. Did it ever occur to you that <b> black </b>people cling to victimhood because it is easy? Whenever I see<b>  black</b> people complaining about injustices it is always stuff that affects a small percentage of people and in no way shows any large scale discrimination but they want to act like they are back on the plantation. MLK would be ashamed.  For being such tough survivors of slavery y'all have turned into whiny little bitches.",
