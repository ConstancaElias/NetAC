I made a seeking arrangement account for 24 hours to see what the sugar daddies would ask for. The only person I know in real life that has an account is a friend of a friend so the desire to know what really goes down still existed within me. Some of it was scary and illegal....some of it was eh. Overall wouldn't recommend, but also not judging. \ud83d\ude31GET YOUR TICKETS TO MEET ME! https://chatalyze.com/profile/AlanaAr...

            "commentText": "I also, am not interested in being a part of this lifestyle, but fun fact: At least where I live, it is actually not illegal to have <b> sex </b>with someone for money(the act of being a prostitute), it is only illegal to pay for<b>  sex</b>, o<b> r sexua</b>l favours, with money(the act of buying a prostitute). There are actually like, a lot of laws in place to protect prostitutes and people working in t<b> he s</b>ex trade industry, because it's not regulated at all and can be very dangerous for them. And as much as you said that you have no disrespect or shame for the people who do live this life-style, I feel like there was a lot of it there... Also not sure what exactly you were expecting this site/app to be? Some sugar Daddy/baby arrangements <b> are </b>sex free, dinner meet ups, social/work functions e.t.c., and the older professionals are just paying for exclusive(closed relationship) which they don't have the time to foster-because of their work schedule and requirements-but a lot of the arrangements on these sites DO <b> have</b> sex in them, and I mean I feel like everyone kind of knew that? Idk, I'm just not really sure how you could come onto the site not knowing anything, and immediately disregard it as a job, because you personall<b> y had no</b>thing but contempt for it from the start? It's not a job that I personally believe in, or would ever chose to commit myself to, but I also wouldn't just disrespect others like that, especially on a very public platform.",

            "commentText": "You say that you aren't shaming these women who sign up for this platform, but you are. Imagine something that you've done that someone else wouldn't agree to, or that the mass majority of people wouldn't agree to/understand, and listen to what you've said in that light. You're shaming people for a choice that you admit that you don't understand.\n\n\nI've never been a sugar baby, so I don't have a truly complete understanding of it, but I've talked to a lot of people who have been sugar babies or daddies and most men aren't creepy. In fact, overwhelmingly most men just want someone to do regular things with. A good amount of these men also need a date for a function. Intimacy isn't just <b> sex.</b> I need everyone to stop thinking that intimacy is only<b>  sex</b>. Intimate relationships look like a lot of different things: parents/guardians, friendships, coaches, mentors<b> , ol</b>d college/uni friends.... these are all intimate relationships and they all look different. The intimacy that you build with someone you're dating isn't ju<b> st sexu</b>al, and if it is the likelihood of that relationship being long-term is low. Intimacy is not j<b> ust </b>sex. Intimacy is not <b> just</b> sex. If two consenting adults<b>  hav</b>e sex -- then the<b> y ha</b>ve sex but that doesn't mean that that was what the money/allowance was for. You equating everything that these two consenting adults might do in an encounter or a we<b> ek to a</b> sexual relationship is unfair. Additionally, you said these men creeped you out for asking to meet up but in every instance that you showed all the men said a public place or left it up to you on the details. So again that's really unfair of you to decide that all of these guys <b> are ju</b<b> >st </b>weird old men looking for a quick fuck. You've written them off without actually knowing anything other than the assumptions that you have -- which at the end of the day mean<b> s you kn</b>ow nothing at all. And no I'm not disregarding that there are creeps out there on these platforms, but there are creeps everywhere including in the medical field and schools, but we all still understand that that's a small minority within the overall community.\n\n\nAs a YouTuber you put in the time and effort to make videos, you're frustrated even in this video about the fact that you've been demonetized many times. Why? Because you put in time and effort, and your time is something that is valuable to you; your time and effort is a commodity. Do not shame women for realizing that there is a market out there where their time, efforts, and whatev<b> er else</b> non-sexual is a commodity that they can use to earn major money. 6k a week, or even a month, is a lot of money that can change a person's life. You may not know this but a lot of the women on these platforms or in these arrangements are putting themselves through school, are using the money to build a savings so that their future is stabilized, are just looking for someone to do the activities with that they love but for whatever reason can't afford, are single moms already working a bunch of jobs that aren't making ends meet, are using this as an avenue to network which is just as valid as any other form. You may not also realize that women get just as lonely as men. It's not easy for everyone to be outgoing and meet someone regardless of the kind of relationship. \n\nAnd a<b> s fa</b>r as the sex thing goes, as I mentioned before<b>  jus</b>t because sex is involved doesn't mean that that's what is being paid for. Additionally, many of these sugar couples agree to not exchange money if they enter a sexually intimate relationship. Also many of these couples are couples for years, naturally when you care about someone on a deeper level that you're also attracted to the <b> possibi</b>lity of sexual intimacy happening is there. \n\nIdk Alana, you said you have a friend who does or has done this and I just feel bad for her. Whether or not she takes offense to this video it's quite obvious what you think of sugar relationships. I tried not to be harsh-toned in this comment, and if I didn't achieve that I am sorry for that. Maybe you should reply to some of these men just so you can see and maybe get a better understanding of these sorts of relationships, but only if you go into it without judgment. \n\nTL;DR: This video was very unfair and very judgmental on the second half, but I believe that that's due to a lack of knowledge and understanding steeped in popular bias on these kinds of relationships.",

I have plenty of friends who did this type of thing too, even just to try it out & the only ones who get offended when people say the things you all find offensive, are the ones who themselves are ashamed of it. If you do this and you get offended with what she says, it most likely is because you feel the need to defend yourself. Why? Because you feel personally attacked & imho you would only take it that way if you already somewhere thought you were doing something wrong/not morally okay with your decision in the first place/conflicted about it previously to this video. I'm coolin', I get that it's not for everyone and she gets that some people do want to do it. People nowadays are triggered so easily, chill out.",

I get that having a smoking hot gf & hearing her read a ton of messages from rich men hitting on her probably isn't a good time, but he needs to work on being grateful you have chosen him, & having fun/not being so negative, so in turn you enjoy spending time with him. This was an interesting video, I've been curious about how those sites work, too and if they were mostly scammers. Which I'm sure those are the type trying to get you off the site and on WhatsApp, so they can try to manipulate you somehow. Stay safe!",

Every single relationship has an agreement of sorts where both people get what they want out of the relationship. So what if it's money? A person should be allowed to do anything, safely,  if it doesn't harm someone else. \nBut that's what I got from this video. \nDo what makes you happy and keeps you afloat. If it's trading intimacy for money, then more power to you. Intimacy is a feeling of close familiarity or closeness. Where intimacy could be more than just <b> sex </b>or for some people, just<b>  sex</b>.\nOkay rant over.",

Like how lonely you gotta be to pay to spent time with somebody and receive female attention that you don't receive on a daily basis. \n\nYou are smart because you saw the market and saw an opportunity. But it's still unethical. \n\nWhy it's so hard to accept you are doing something unethical? Honest question, with all the respect you deserve. People shame <b> sex </b>workers, even women do it.

I don't know much about this but it's clear to me that the men can vary a little but most insist on<b>  sex</b> but you have to meet and go out with the men for the sugar baby to get the money. The older guys with the lower testosterone are the ones more likely to be content with just a sugar baby's company. I heard women often sugar babies get gifts rather than cash. And even if they get paid for havin<b> g se</b>x with the men, I don't care, to each their own. My only issue is that both parties are fully consenting. Being a sugar baby is not for t<b> he wom</b>an who thinks they can get money and gifts without giving what the men want in return. Any girl who thinks they can be in and maintain such a one-sided relationship of any sort is painfully na\u00efve and gonna get burned. Think of it this way (exclude family, close friends and charity work): would you give someone money or a gift for simply talking or being in your company <b> and noth</b>ing more?   The answer is NO. I certainly wouldn't. And men definitely won't give something without something in return and most likely go on Seeking Arrangements thinking it's a place to meet women<b>  for</b> sex. I'd suggest being careful on the sugar daddy for several reasons, some obvious but another reason don't consider is that the man may be fake and not have nearly as much money as they claim. I've no idea why a man that isn't rich would go on Seeking Arrangements since it's for wealthy men to find young women (or vice versa) - maybe to make a video like this or something more harmful. If it's just the hookup aspect there are plenty of apps that men can use instead and it won't matter to anyone if the people on them are rich or not. Anyone I don't care if someone chooses to do Seeking Arrangements or anything like it. Just be aware, safe and 100% consenting. If anything is telling you to back out at any point, listen.",

I've had people offer me money to not work or pay my rent and let them take me shopping or take me to dinner but I have never gone. I had friends that have done it and in the past I had a hard time balancing work and school and I would've considered it if I wasn't so paranoid and worried about what other people would think. However, I hope that if anyone does meet up for a situation like this that you do not go anywhere private because you never know anyone's intentions and there is so many things you can do for money that you can feel good about doing. Regardless of what you do be safe! It's funny to talk about and feel like you could handle it until you come face to face with them- and in my case just from seeing them at work and not asking to meet. They can be rather pushy in a 'nice' way and use money as power to get you to do things you wouldn't do normally. I feel like we are taught to be polite and for me personally it makes it hard for me to walk away from conversation. Just remember you have choices!",

He knew what this app was about so of course the messages you get there will be <b> sexual.</b> If he couldn\u2018t handle it, he should have told her before. But in my personal opinion it wouldn\u2018t be a good sign if your partner can\u2018t deal with that. You can disagree of course but I think jealousy over something like that shows little self esteem and that you don\u2018t trust your partner at all. I mean it was so obvious that her heart wasn\u2018t in it at all and at the end of the day YT is her job. If he had found this app on her phone, it would be a completely different story but it was<b>  nothing</b> like that.",

I honestly know people who have never worked a day in their lives who can fully support themselves because they lie to the government about their situation and receive obscene amounts of money in EBT (food stamps) or claim a disability when there is none. I absolutely agree that laziness is disgusting and breaking up a relationship is disgusting. However, that doesn't mean that someone who enjoys the lifestyle of being with a man, a <b> woman,</b> or anyone else to get money or vacations or dinner is wrong. Some people are willing to do things for money, and some will lie and cheat. Sugar babies should never be shamed for their lifestyle even if you don't agree with it. Personally, I don't have a dream career or anything like that. I just want to be married and have a happy life with my husband. Is that shameful? To some people, yes, but it shouldn't be. We can only see our very very limited perspective, and it isn't fair to judge anyone. I have a hard time with it myself, so don't feel like I'm calling anyone out or being hypocritical. Just try to love and understand others and have compassion for those you don't agree with <3",

Like how lonely you have to be to pay someone to spent time with you.\nWomen are smart for taking advantage of this market and getting money to get whatever they want. But let's not act like it's not wrong. \n\n Low value men because money doesn't determine your value and high value men would never pay to spent time with some women who just want his money. \n\nActing <b> blind </b>whenever we see something wrong it's what it's getting to this time we are living into. Both men and women gotta do better. We are better than this.\n\nAnd tell me I'm wrong. Now you can't call out someone when they are doing something unethical because you are supposed to \"mind your own business\". This why the <b> \"gender</b> equality\" the media always talk about it's never going to happen. There is double standard for everything. I try to be a better human being by calling both men and women when they are wrong.",

I have never kissed a beautifu<b> l woma</b>n in my whole life and tbh, I've been missing to know how it feels for my whole life - should I feel guilty, aren't all men the same ? I believe it's a basic need, only not vital - , although I had some adventures, but with girls who would not turn my head, though they were adorable friends. But I don't even have any money so I will never use this. However, I respect the girls who can accept this job, whatever their limits are, bc, I don't know if it is any part of their motivation, but they bring some happiness and maybe some kind of unforgettable experience, and thus, they also put some kind of an end to t<b> he sexu</b>al competition war that is such a cost for the world, except that the customers still have to be rich, unfortunately. Sorry for my english, for the seriousness of the comment, and for looking like a beggar, I think my reflexion is worth it anyway, bc it opens a lot of interesting and fundamental debates.",

I was very careful to choose my words and be very precise, please don't try to read lines between the lines, please don't act just to look politically correct, and please consider the depth of the debates I open here, if you can. Your own words form a oxymorum, a rapist is someone who has no mercy, in no case someone who wants pity. He's got no empathy for the person he's torturing. I accept discussing, but I need an interlocutor with intellectual honesty and mind depth, not an emotional reactor who enjoys finding any opportunity to throw a stone because some words seem to give him the green card. Thank you.",

One of my friends went through with it (I used to sit a block away from the meets to make sure she's okay) but like she's making a living out of it now and she has a private investigator that does backgrounds on the people to make sure they haven't had people press charges on them for meets like this and make sure they actually do have the money and they are being honest and 99.9% of the time she doesn't do anything intimate (0.01% is when she wants to) but she makes a really good living off of it. I could never understand it I guess it's just too far outta my comfort zone but like if people are actually doing this I suggest you also get a private investigator just to be safe.",

And lastly; please know that if you have happened to sell your soul to o some type of a power, a spirit, a contract, or even; the devil to please know that JESUS CHRIST has the ability to break up any of those types of relationships.",

People who have money don't just give it away for <b> nothing,</b> that\u2018s why they have money in the first place. They\u2018d rather donate it to a charity, buy gifts for their friends and family or collect expensive items. And you won't find filthy rich men of that caliber on those sites anyway, simply because they have better things to do with their time and meet insanely attractive and interesting people anyway.\nThe only way those people will give you money \u201ejust because you\u2018re talking to them', is when they actually get to know and like you and for that you have to meet them and cultivate a relationship with them. Rich men aren't<b>  dumb</b>, they are very aware of scammers and rinsers. That also goes for regulars who give very high tips to their favourite strippers, escorts and camgirls just to spend time with them and talk to them \u2014 they do this because they genuinely like them and have known them for some time.\n\nOf course you could meet a unicorn, that sweet older gentleman who isn't horny and just wants to makes you happy because he\u2018s smitten with you, but even he will want to meet you and be sure that you are who you are and that he isn't giving his precious money to a catfish.\n\nStay realistic, stay safe and don't believe everything people tell to get attention.",

Like yeah def a good thing to mention or show your man if he's not treating you well but this video & the views for it are not worth it! You might not know it yet but something like this could potentially ruin your relationship (&some viewers). I respect that your a hustler & are trying to find different ideas for entertainment but you need to find better boundaries especially with your man. Even if he said 'fine ok' I'm 100% he would rather you not do this.",

ALL women will do this for the right amount of money for the right guy. They will leave boyfriends, husbands, and relationships that they have been in for years. It happens all the time. #themoreyouwknow",

You would for sure leave your boyfriend if Leonardo Dicaprio started texting you and asking you to go to Cannes (if not Leo there is a guy you immediately thought of in your own head just now). All women are hypergamous and the better looking they are the more hypergamy we typically see. Why do rich famous women who have rich famous boyfriends cheat? Miranda Kerr is a great example. \n\nIt's not degrading to women to speak facts. Men are the same way, except we value looks instead of money and career opportunity. You literally prove my point by saying you wouldn't do it \"now that I have my own business and have grown.\" Sorry, #facts are #facts. Let's see if you are with the same guy in 10 years or 20 years. It's the marathon, not the sprint that always proves this point.",

I feel for my fellow broke ladies who feel the need to sell their souls to a man for 6k a month. It's not entirely their fault that life is unaffordable but they're responsible for themselves, maybe even happy doing it. Idk how tho it's like they put a dollar amount on their self worth.",

Not everyone will want to share or be honest, but this way we might get more insight and details w/out misleading desperate lonely dudes and w/out putting your poor sweet bf through too much more discomfort lol. Just a thought!",

There are plenty of videos of people who've done this, but basically girls are attracted to it for the money but it's very rare to find a guy who's just gonna throw money at you, pay your rent, etc. These are guys who want traveling companions (someone to fuck while they go on work trips) and the most you'll get is probably free dinners, in exchange for <b> sex,</b> obvi. Or a free dress or something. And yeah, the guys are usually<b>  old</b> and ugly, and probably married. It's really not that big of a mystery",

She had been using a sugar daddy, sugar baby site(s) and is most likely how she met her killer. The sugar daddy connection has not been so widely publicized as a courtesy to her, her family. You could make an entire video just on this aspect of the case. I'm pretty sure she had used the same website as shown in your video.

Why are you getting all butt hurt over his actions not mine. He kept saying \"are you considering it\" blah blah blah. I never said my opinion on it whether it's ethical or not I just said that it's sad her own boyfriend who in her contacts is under future husband thinks she is capable of it. I'm not saying it's bad if you aren't in a committed relationship or if you are but they are okay with it (which he clearly isn't) she said herself she wouldn't do it while she is in a committed relationship so it's sad that her boyfriend is questioning her is all",

Since we clicked on this video, we obviously knew it wasn't supposed to be taken that serious and we were all just as curious. I get it if he really wasn't into this kind of a video, but acting like your girl is gonna leave you throughout the whole time and being so obviously scared about it is not ok. If he simply weren't that into the idea but still wanted to support her he would've told her in private then just let her be, knowing that in the end it is still just a youtube video an<b> d nothin</b>g is really serious.

These are rich and busy guys who are wanting to date and have <b> sex </b>with hot women, and they are willing to pay the women an allowance, buy them lots of gifts, and take them to nice restaurants in order to so. It's pretty straightforward. Young hot lady gets money, guy gets to be seen and have<b>  sex</b> with young hot lady.",

I stumbled across this video and wanted to clarify, with my opinion solicited or not I can voice it but let's be honest here first generation Americans with parents descendent from a European country would still fit into the same box as a white American. It's truly not that deep. Anyone saying she's mixed is really reaching. Maybe their census or categories are different in European countries idk but here to me it seems pretty clear where she lies. So no boo you're using the word<b>  racism</b> very loosely and sorry sis I'm not jealous",

Photo is from 10 years ago. Anyways. I even though about getting a rich guy (just 1) to take care of me. Being an activist is difficult when no salary and only volunteer while fighting powerful special interests, including mass media. #AlternativeMedia & #AlternativeHealing by #MayaBell",

            "commentText": "Lol this website can actually be really good! A lot of times it's just straight up prostitution (which honestly I have no problem with as long as it's safe and consensual) but most of the time it's either REALLY busy guys who dont have time for a relationship, a really lonely guy who can't find a relationship, or a really \"unattractive\" man who feels like he has to pay for companionship. A lot of the men on there have a lot of money and want to go on vacations and to nice restaurants or to watch a movie but they have <b> nobody </b>to do that with so a sugar baby kind of works out because they're someone to share your experiences with and to provide fun and companionship to your time away from work or to their lonely lives. It's pretty cool! If you put in your profile that any physical intimacy is off the table you'll get less messages. Also, they usually want to meet you right away because they want to see if they like you and can talk to you because if you don't vibe you're not going to have fun together going out to do fun things or going on vacation. My friend had like 3 sugar daddies from SA in college to help her out and she never had<b>  sex</b> or kissed any of them. They hung out in public, did fun activities, they would take her shopping, help her out with bills, etc. She loved it! The only reason she stopped was because she got into a serious relationship and he didn't like it, lol.",

No ones body should be able to attach a price to it. Any girls thinking of this I really hope you really consider any other option to make money you are worthy of respect and you matter. You can do it on your own you don't need a <b> old </b>man daddy who wants to live out his creepy role plays with you. Girl get to work and take yourself to spas and vacations without the violations.

I' m sure most of the people that will view this video will watch it because they're having thoughts of joining the site and may not think about the potential threats to their safety. I'm sure this site works out for some people but the truth is that you don't really know who you're meeting or what you're getting yourself into. If there's any girls thinking about trying out the site, ask the 'Sugar Daddy' if he would be ok with you bringing a friend on your first date with you. If he's not okay with that, then run! If he's a cool dude and actually wants you to feel safe and secure he wouldn't mind allowing you having a friend meet him with you so you feel more safe and comfortable. I'm just bringing up some ways to  keep people safe because I don't want to shame anyone who wants to try it out, I just hope that all girls using this site will be safe.",

So I let having Major depressive disorder, Anxiety and ADD while trying to balance meds, fly home to take care of my grandma as much as possible and not to fail my semester, justify the decision to go through with it. I only met I think 4 people. 3 were pretentious. One was humble, well accomplished and our first time meeting, he didn't have any expectations and we just met for coffee. He emails me still every so often and is incredibly sweet. He also offered to pay one of my bills I pulled up on my iPad. Instead of clicking the one bill of $300 he chose to pay for all of them(which was two years worth of seeing my psychiatrist and therapist). I'd say a majority want good things and try for good intentions but with as much wealth as some have they tend to be condescending but like in a playful teasing \u2018I know more than you' way. But maybe like 35% are decent to good men. So yes there are of course other options to go to but I tried it out because when you are alone and have no family and few friends that you can't really depend on and are really pushing your brain to keep from suicidal ideation while barely being able to afford groceries or meds, well it feels like you're left with no option.",

The night she went missing, she had taken an Uber to a park to be picked up by him and the last text she sent was to her mom telling her she landed and was safe. She didn't tell anyone, friends, sorority sisters, roommates etc. where she was going. PLEASE! If you read this, in your follow up vid, could you please tell your viewers that whether this is their lifestyle or you're going out on a date or something, ALWAYS have someone you can trust to tell where you will be and how long you will be gone and to update if your plans change. I recommend reading about the Mackenzie Lueck case. Our world isn't completely safe and we need to all be cautious.",

I respect you for helping out your grandmother, it just shows that your intentions are good & all that matters is how YOU feel about the situation/arrangement, if it makes you feel worthless, used, or insecure than stop doing it but if that's not the case do what you gotta do!",

I understand trying to make money and it can feel like an easy or the only option, but because of the nature/secrecy of these relationships you are also putting yourself in danger. No worth it IMO. Letting people know where you are and with who, and updates on your plans is definitely a precaution to take if you do decide to find one of these relationships.",

Or speak to someone close to you because I guarantee it will help instead of spreading negativity on others and there is just no point in that. I pray you get more positive and for whatever bad thing is going on in your life, i wish you the best and i hope you feel happier soon and learn how to deal with your angers and issues. \ud83d\ude4f",
