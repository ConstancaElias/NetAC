You take a leave period, it's great for you and the family, but in what way is it great for the person taking money from the wallet to give to the person who won't turn up for work for an entire year? That doesn't mean that taking leave should not be allowed, I think it should be a right, but it still has no benefit for the person running the business.",

I've dealt with several egotistical, sexist, grabby assholes in my time and I'm just beyond fucking over it (as are most women who've experienced that, I'm sure). We just shouldn't have to deal with that, period. Our bodies are our own and should be respected as such. Never sexually touch a <b> woman </b>unless you are explicitly invited to!

I said pregnancy is inconvenient for a business, and you gave no counter-arguments to that assertion. Obviously, we have to pro-create, but from a business perspective, of course it's more advantageous to not have to deal with paid maternity leave. I'm not saying that the method of thinking is ethical, but what I can for certain tell you is that pregnancy is always economically bad for a business because all it does is suck money out of a company on account of one person's child.",

In my opinion, for children and teens?  Yes, I do believe kids can be desensitized to violence through things like video games.  But for adults,  your personality is already formed.  As a firefighter and hockey player, I know that men especially need an outlet for aggression.  Some dudes go to the gym or run marathons, or work super hard jobs and some guys kick ass in a cyber world and still lead perfectly normal lives.  But I'd rather see kids getting outside or cutting lawns or playing sports to use up that energy than running over make-believe hookers in a video game.  Far too often I've seen violent video games used as a babysitter.  That's just a recipe for disaster.  Maybe not all kids will be adversely affected, but enough will be to create problems.  Personally I love dark, dirty  comedy, but I just don't find joking about rape funny.  I also don't find 9/11 jokes or pedophilia jokes or animal abuse jokes funny either.  Guess I'm a real prude, eh?",

This was a radio discussion between two associates, with one asking if it was \"okay\" with a dad, Donald to call Ivanka \"a piece of ass.\"  Donald said it was fine!  THAT is the issue.  NO man I know would tell another man that was ok and it would be pretty clear from just a quick look that the other guy better find another way of expressing himself.  This wasn't a cat-call in some dark alley!  Grow up and stop twisting things to make Trump and rape comments/jokes seem acceptable. Assholes like you are the reason Trump got elected.  Either you're some uneducated, jealous moron who believed obviously false crap like the Clintons worshiped Lucifer and performed <b> alien </b>blood rituals OR you're some weak, sniveling little lazy sucking-off-the-teat socialist who make normal Democrats look bad. I doubt you've ever held a real job for more than a few months. Do you give waitresses a hard time too?  You remind me of the kind of guy that bitches at the firefighters for leaving their child's new shoes inside the burning house they got saved from, even though the firefighter went back in and risked his life to save the family's pets.  Mitt Romney is a very diplomatic person, but I doubt he would ever say it was \"fine\" to describe his own daughter that way or just sit by and let it happen.  I'm very sorry if you were raised where things like that are ok.  And I'm sorry for your daughter, if you have one, that her father is not a stronger man. Go back and play your video games.

Yes he's traditionalist & probably has his reasons (working hard, providing a lot, wants home to run smoothly & without distractions). Pregnancy IS inconvenient for a business, that's a fact. That in NO way implies that anyone is against pregnancy or pregnant women, but that the realities of keeping a year-round business going have to be tended to & taken into consideration. Duh. \n\nAnd so on. The Clinton's are HORRIBLY DISRESPECTFUL murdering BEASTS. And more! And Hillary definitely has way more going for her than just being a woman: She is George Soros' puppet.
