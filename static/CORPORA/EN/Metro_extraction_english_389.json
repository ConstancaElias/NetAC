        "postText": "Brexit threatened to claim another political scalp today as Tom Watson faced being ousted as the deputy leader of the Labour party.', 'The opening of the party\u2019s conference in Brighton has been overshadowed by the aborted coup, which was labelled as \u2018completely mad\u2019 and \u2018dangerous\u2019 by MPs and former PM Tony Blair.', 'A motion was set to be debated at the event, which would have seen the second-in-command position abolished.', 'If successful, it would have removed Mr Watson \u2013 a vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn and the leader\u2019s stance over Brexit', 'Mr Watson, a Remainer, said he was \u2018taken by surprise\u2019 at the ambush, saying it was not on the agenda.', 'He claimed \u2018I got a text message in a Chinese restaurant in Manchester to say that they were abolishing me.\u2019', 'MPs rallied round Mr Watson, saying the motion \u2013 put forward by the Corbyn-supporting group Momentum \u2013 was \u2018outrageous.\u2019', 'They claimed the party should stop bickering and instead concentrate their efforts on fighting Boris Johnson and the Tory party.', 'In the end, Mr Corbyn stepped in and the party\u2019s ruling National Executive Committee drew back from an immediate vote.', 'The leader said the deputy role would now be reviewed at a future date but stopped short of saying whether he had full confidence in his second-in-command.', 'Instead, Mr Corbyn said: \u2018Tom Watson is the deputy leader of the party and I enjoy working with him.\u2019', 'Mr Watson has been at odds with Mr Corbyn and has been pushing for Labour to back staying in the European Union in any future referendum.', 'He recently called for a new Brexit referendum to be held before a general election.', 'Mr Corbyn has said an election should come first while he has refused to say which side he might back in a future Brexit referendum.', 'In putting forward the vote, a Momentum source told the BBC: \u2018We just can\u2019t afford to go into an election with a deputy leader set on wrecking Labour\u2019s chances.', 'The attempt to remove Mr Watson provoked a furious response from Labour MPs at a time when the conference is meant to put Mr Corbyn\u2019s team firmly on an election footing.', 'Ex-prime minister Mr Blair said: \u2018A decision to abolish the post of deputy leader would be undemocratic, damaging and politically dangerous.', '\u2018To suggest it at this time shows a quite extraordinary level of destructive sectarianism.\u2019', 'Former Labour leader Mr Miliband said: \u2018The move to abolish the deputy leader post without warning or debate is undemocratic, wrong and should not happen.', '\u2018Those who came up with the idea for the eve of Labour conference have taken leave of their senses.\u2019', 'Tottenham MP David Lammy said: \u2018Tribal infighting in the middle of a Boris Johnson-inspired national emergency makes me want to weep.', '\u2018My constituents and millions of others across the country desperately need the Labour party united right now. The Tories, not Tom Watson, are our opponents. Let\u2019s fight them.\u2019', 'The position of deputy leader has existed for nearly a century within the party.', 'John Robert Clynes became the first deputy leader in 1922, and the position has since been held by prominent Labour figures including John Prescott and Harriet Harman.', 'The issue of Brexit is likely to dominate the party\u2019s annual conference with more than 90 motions submitted \u2013 the majority supporting a Remain stance.', 'Mr Corbyn has rejected claims that the party\u2019s policy over our departure from the EU is a \u2018muddle\u2019 and that he is \u2018sitting on the fence.\u2019', 'He has said that a Labour government would secure a \u2018sensible\u2019 Brexit deal and put that to a referendum, with the other option being to stay in the European Union.', 'However, the majority of the motions submitted by constituency parties have called for the party to back staying in the European Union \u2013 which could mean campaigning against a deal secured by Labour negotiators.', 'Scottish and Welsh Labour are both committed to the Remain cause.', 'The attempted coup has seen accusations that Mr Corbyn\u2019s leadership is attempting to stifle a bid by members to throw their weight behind the Remain cause.', 'Mr Corbyn has claimed there is a \u2018happy and united mood\u2019 at the conference in Brighton and the party is \u2018totally united on defeating this Tory Government.\u2019",

How predictable that the Metro didn't see fit to publish that important little fact. I don't know what this devious man was trying to achieve, but Corbyn has done the smart thing and squashed it.And that's the news that's fit to print!",
