More like when you take a picture and you make yourself look good simply for you instead of someone else, it makes you feel really good about yourself. It's so easy to feel self conscious and down about yourself and your looks but when you get yourself looking nice just  because  you do feel good and that's a powerful thing because it gives you confidence.",

                    "commentText": "@Elithale Shepard \nMost of your points seem like excuses. Where is the proof that that question came from a fan? And what do you mean by seen to many girls that pay attention to only make-up and cell phone? I'm going to be honest but you seem like the type to rather go by stereotypes rather than actual facts. That's the thing here. Most of these things they asked were very stereotypical and not to mention an invasion of privacy. \n\n\"If the interviewer was a <b> woman </b>she would've replied differently.\" Funny, considering most of these interviewers questioning other celebrities are women themselves. What makes you think only Ariana Grande would reply differently if it was a<b>  woman</b>?\n\nAbout Taylor Swift and Katy Perry. You honestly cannot use their situation to back up your point. Or Nicki's. Are you trying to say that part of supporting women means agreeing with each other no matter what? Did you even realize what they were arguing about? That's like you telling me not to end terms with someone who's rude and fake because she's a female. And not to go after someone who keeps bashing me just because she's female. If she was arguing with a man, would you have reacted different? Yeah, she means supporting each other when it comes to general terms. Like rights and policies, not always in personal matters.\n\n\"Which in your opinion sparks segregation instead of-\" Okay, say no more. These are clearly all your opinions. They aren't facts which came from the discussion of the video. They are just your own biased opinions. You do realize in this day an<b> d ag</b>e that sexists do exist, right? That racists still exist right? Th<b> at homophob</b>ic people still exist right? Since you stated my opinion, I will state mine. Unless there is a constant reminder towards something and why, those types of people will always show up. Why on Earth would people get mad ove<b> r a wo</b>man talking about bei<b> ng a w</b>oman to win an award? Do you realize the point? If you get upset over that then you clearly have a b<b> it of s</b>exism in you. There shouldn't be a reason for you to get mad over that. Of co<b> urse a</b> woman is a person. But how often do yo<b> u see </b>a woman being chosen for it? She felt the need to express her gratitude and hard work on<b>  being</b> a woman that earned that title. What exactly is wrong about that? And how exactly does it promote segregation? It doesn't. You're just offended that she talked about hersel<b> f bein</b>g a woman to win <b> the awar</b>d. Nothing else. \n\nAbout the weight and health questions - I can really begin to see your biased self coming out. \"What's offensive about that? That's a compliment.\" In your opinion it is. Why do you feel the need to refer your opinion as a fact? Do you not realize that every person is different and responds to such differently? If someone makes it clear to you to quit asking about their personal problems. Quit asking about their personal problems. If someone did the same to you on a different category: such as depression, your family, and such... Would your opinion still reply? He's supposed to ask about the fucking movie, not their weight. Not to mention it was the same dude tw<b> ice. Y</b>ou're weird asf for supporting some creep who legit asked if she was wearing any lingerie. Something is honestly wrong with you. And please link me the source on where it was behalf on fans considering it was the same dude twice.",

Hell i even did it bc it makes you feel good that you worked your ass off and it actually paid off in the end. So it was probably strange for the one host to not see her overjoyed over whatever positive comments they gave her. \n\nbut i love queen with such an amazing response.",

If you claim that you're a femenist yet you go around harassing men and pouring bleach on their crotches, you are actually a misandrist, which is someone who has a hatred towards men. The reason why you think that feminism is bad, is because misandrists ruin real femenist's reputation. \n\nFeminism was never supposed to be made as a \"kill all men\" group. It was made because <b> woman </b>haven't gotten the equality they deserve. Even today women still don't get equal pay. Yes, women are lucky enough that we're allowed to vote, we're allowed to work, but we're still not getting equal pay, which is exactly why feminism still exists.

Compliments are not a wrong thing, and are really appreciated. But people do some creepy stuffs too.

Actresses are always asked regarding diet questions while men get asked serious plot questions, as if women are only a piece of decoration. And yes, asking someone what underwear they wear is very perverted. Men or women, asking the opposite <b> sex </b>what kind of underwear they wear or if they are wearing any is just sick lol, how you find that to be normal is beyond me",

I said <b> Black </b>Widow is<b>  dumb</b> in the sense of it being <b> a dum</b>b comic book concoction. Not that the artifice of her fake character traits makes her unintelligent. You need reading comprehension. It's a silly movie franchise, the action is absolutely laughable and antithetical to the reality of the physical world. Even in casting ScarJo it is problematic, to look at her body, she h<b> as ze</b>ro musculature. She has a small waist, large supple breasts, and child-bearing hips. She is not an athlete and the stunts and green screen required to create these silly Avenger / ScarJo / Spider Widow movies for socially and emotionally retarded adults is laughable. Same w/ Gal Gadot. She has the st<b> ick t</b>hin body of a super model, which is what she is. Not a fighter. In an actual fight,<b>  her </b>thin bones would be snapped like twigs. Same w/ ScarJo, who is 5'3'. There is no fight where she beats a 6'2' man like myself. She would be bent over their knee and spanked.\n\nThese comics, and their attendant 18th and 33rd sequels<b>  have</b> zero stakes. None of the comic book cartoon heroes can die. They always win in the end. Always. Th<b> ere i</b>s zero surprise who will win in the end. It is literal mindless viewing intended for undeveloped minds, i.e. children. So many of folks like yo<b> u in</b> my age cohort are arrested in their development. Perpetual children, playing video games, watching silly spandex comics, not taking life seriously as they should. And so I pity my generation actually.\n\nAs far as cartoons / comics being a diversion, a mindless diversion, again you choose to be diverted by childish things, rather than real drama, real storytelling, real stakes, real mystery, real humanity.

Actual real drama, real stories, w/ substance, stakes, and meaning.\n\nYou can not argue the fact that you choose to hero worship cartoons. Literal cartoons. You, and ppl like you, are what's wrong w/ this country. It's a lack of intellect. A lack of engaging w/ the real world. It's running away and hiding in comic books and cartoons.

But I'm honest where you girls are not. Look at her filmography. She's chosen these roles. She chose to be in a catsuit as <b> Black </b>Widow for a decade w/ standalone films to come. She chose to be the<b>  sex</b> pot in Woody Allen's Match Point who steals a man away w/ her sexuality. She chose to play the blonde Jerse<b> y bimb</b>o in Don Jon. She chose to be a literal object <b> of sexu</b>al desire in The Girl With the Pearl Earring. She chose to be a cyborg in another form fitting bodysuit that hugged her curves and private parts in Ghost in the Shell. She chooses time after time to take roles that play up her sexuality, her large breasts, <b> her t</b>hin waist, and her beauty. She's never choosing to play roles as a ca<b> reer w</b>oman. Or a doctor. Or a lawyer. Or a mom. She wants to<b>  be </b>a sex symbol. And guess what, guys? She's succeeded! Myself and every other guy (straig<b> ht <b> a</b</b>>nd gay) thinks<b>  she</b>'s a sex bomb. Because that's what she chose. So interviewers rightly ask about her sexuality, her boobs, her panties, her bodysuits, her beauty. It comes w/ being a sexpot instead of a serious actress like Amy Adams or Meryl Streep.",

With ScarJo, you mentioned baby weight, which is irrelevant. Her issue is height. She's too small to effectively fight a man. At 5'3' and 115 she cannot fight a man of even average height at 5'9 and 185 lbs. She'd be destroyed.\n\nAlso note how you discuss ScarJo's body and weight as a negative.

Maybe if you offered a Twix or a Milky Way. Maybe a chocolate turtle. Mmm. Then you'd be talking my language. Maybe that would address the hanger you claim that I am suffering from. Just a thought.\n\nYou make several assertions, so I was take them one by one:\n\nI am a fan of Mackenzie Dern. She's attractive w/ a large bosom, and is a decent, tho not great fighter. The Jinh Yu Frey girl is even smaller, fighting at 105. Neither of them would have a chance against an average sized man at 5'9' 180 lbs. There is a reason why men and women are not allowed to compete in sport against one another. On average men are stronger, faster, taller, more explosive, and more violent than women. It's just unfair. The average female is 5'4'. The average male is 5'9'. This is merely biology.\n\nLearning to fight someone larger in a gym is different from doing so in real life. And I know the same weak points as any<b>  woman</b> might learn (knees, ankles, joints, eyes, neck, and on and on), plus I am much faster, much stronger, and a foot taller, meaning in a real fight I could keep any smal<b> l woma</b>n at distance if I wanted to. But I could also pick her up and hold her unable to attack me.\n\nAs for 3rd and 4th wave feminism, which I ascribe to, it means women have agency and determinism in choosing the<b> ir sexu</b>al lives and how the choose to present their sexuality to the world. I noticed as so many regressive feminists like to do, you distorted my words. I never ScarJo should be specialized by others. Rather, what I said was that ScarJo has chosen film roles of her own volition that sexualize her. And because of that she will be asked questions about her sexuality and wardrobe. Asking a person questions about their own choices is not objectification. And to think otherwise is misguided.\n\nYou should care who I have canvassed w/ and who I have read because it speaks to my willingness to learn and expand my feminist ideology and my desire to champion women political leaders. That is important in the continued feminist movement. What's more I have contributed campaign contribution money in just the past 12 months to a diverse set of women including Ilhan (my favorite member of Congress), AOC, Rashida Tlaib, Carmen Yulin Cruz, and Elizabeth Warren. So don't tell me I'm a dick. I'm a supporter of women and a true blue feminist.\n\nAnd I do love the female body. It is exquisite and I make no apologies for that fact as a heterosexual male. I will not be demonized because I call it like it is. ScarJo is a s<b> exy wo</b>man. She also sexualizes herself by so often choosing roles that focus on her body, her silhouette, her soft curves, and her breasts. Again, this is not a negative. This is just what she does. My point is don't act like it's some patriarchal issue to ask about her body when those are the only roles she does.\n\nAgain, why no similar sexualizing of other marquee actresses. Will you not address this point? Amy Adams, Meryl, Lupita, Emma Stone, Penelope Cruz, Jessica Chastain, and on and on. ScarJo has this issue because of her own choices. And you guys don't want to admit she brings this on herself.",

Go back and read every one of my comments. I said that a good faith interviewer could ask about the sexiness of her characters because that's basically all she does as an actress. Appear in skin tight outfights (numerous marvel movies, Ghost in the Shell, etc) and act as the eye candy in the rest of her movies (Don Jon, Match Point, Girl w/ the Pearl Earring, and on and on).\n\nAs to her height I think it's quite attractive and not a hindrance at all to her acting. She's just not believable as a fighter or taking down men 12 inches taller and 100+ lbs. heavier than she is. It's laughable and makes the Marvel movies even more silly than they already are.\n\nI am a feminist. 3rd/4th wave intersectional feminist. I believe in equality in all things for women. I believe in a woman's right to choose. I believe that instead of exporting tools of war America should export women's rights to places like Saudi Arabia and Iran. My identity as a feminist cannot be questioned. I may be more feminist than even you if we drilled down to specifics.\n\nAnd I don't hate ScarJo's acting. I could never hate anything about her. But it is one-note. And she carries that smoky sultry voice from role to role to role. So, no one is gonna accuse her of being the next Meryl Streep. But that's okay. She's gorgeous. I could watch her read the telephone book and be enraptured.\n\nAnd call me <b> crazy,</b> but I think I could still have an outside shot w/ her. I work in the film biz. So, who knows.",

So, rather than stop, I think I'll continue instead. I fell in love w/ ScarJo when she was in the Coen brothers' movie, The Man Who Wasn't There. But that's a film that's probably too arty for you.

I might look like a stupid angsty teen ranting on a probably white 40 y/o male, but, as I said, those platforms play a bigger role today.<b>  Black</b> Widow is an icon to younger people that will probably rule over in the next few years.

I'm not 40 years <b> old </b>or white either. ScarJo was actually my celebrity crush growing up. She's older than I am. And she's not anyone's idol just because she shows of her curves and her cleavage and her nipples on film. She's just an actress. You need better role models. Try Michelle Obama. Try Oprah Winfrey. Try Megan Rapinoe. Try Elizabeth Warren. Try Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Try Ilhan Omar. Try women who have actually done something worthwhile w/ their lives, who have changed the world, who aren't showing<b>  nip</b> in every other film they do. How about even just idolizing good actors. ScarJo is a bad actress for one thing. That's a bigger crime than the trashy comic book movies she makes. An<b> d Blac</b>k Widow is a stupid character. Totally unrealistic, the physics of the jumping and fighting she does mak<b> es ze</b>ro sense. And in real life she would get beaten up but the 6'2' men she regularly fights in those marvel movies.

What you said can be sexist and pretty wierd, but I don't think you're trying to hurt or degrade anybody. I don't think Scarlett wanted her character to be sexualized, but the media made her like that. People look over Widow's looks than her personality and wisdom, not Scarlett. I highly disagree with how<b>  Black</b> Widow can't defeat a 6\" man, or any women. That is pretty sexist dude.

If they can place a sense of discomfort and competition between women then they've won. I remember specifically a boy (older than me though) in which he would try and make me uncomfortable and self conscious by implying or explicitly saying the other<b>  woman</b> was prettier, better; how I needed makeup and they didn't. I will admit little young self absorbed:self conscious=ungrateful me believed him and I would dislike or let it drain me. However, I learned is not their fault. Similarly when a man found me attractive even if they had <b> a woma</b>n. So, now I learned how to reply to him/others: praising myself AND the other gi<b> rl/wom</b>an. When friends or men introduce their girl/ wife I pay attention  and respect to her by elevating not just her physical beauty also any attributes I noticed or have been mentioned by him. I'll admit it is hard at Times not to compare yourself to others and how easy to take self pity by putting others down. However it all boils down to ungratefulness and not knowing oneself's strengths. I love to en outage ot<b> her wo</b>man and no I'm not interested in them platonically nor sexually just living the 'girl code' as man rather die for their 'guy code'!",

Correct usage of the word there would be the following \"There are many spelling and grammar errors in your comments up there, yet you feel entitled to criticize someone else for making a hyperbole, which is linguistically correct. There, there, don't be too embarrassed.\" One function the word \"there\" DOESN'T have is as a possessive adjective. That would have to be \"their\".

Your songs about your ex are usually listing a bunch bad things your ex used to do.  Those are different, and you perfectly know how male and female breakup song cliches are.  Of course guy songs have to be apologetic, and I still wish you the best even though you're not with me type.  Girl songs can't be \"I was wrong, oh give me another chance\" feel because that's just not cool and attractive for a girl, so you have to write the \"I'm so much better than this/him\"  You are a successful song writer who knows how the pop song works.  Don't try to twist it/lie about it for your own agenda.",

Its sad that they still have to encounter this questions and awkward situations, while men they don't even deal with these issues cause they have a penis hanging, how ridiculous does that sound to you? Exactly, that's why feminism exists my friend society is fucked up still.",

I'm not a huge Taylor fan, I might sing along to some of her songs and that's it. But I think everything she said here made perfect sense, and I admire her greatly for doing what she does even though she gets a lot of hate from people because of her songs. She's a brave, strong <b> woman,</b> who has to deal with rumours, secrets, the media and hate, and the fact that she's still speaking up for herself when people approach her with sexist (or other inappropriate) remarks is really admirable.\nSame goes to Cardi B, and literally, any celebrity (BOTH MEN AND WOMEN) who has to deal with sexist shit because people (BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AGAIN) can't get around the idea that values are changing, and that things which didn't seem appropriate before have become that much less 'abnormal' and that sooner or later, these things WILL change, whether they like it or not. Change is in the air. Change is gonna happen. I pray it happens.",

They can hate it but still use it. They can love or hate and survive without it. It's that you shouldn't generalise and make assumptions towards any <b> gender </b>as if everyone is the same in how they see the make up and its role in relevance to their lives. Some love it and use it some don't. Some need it some don't. They still can have it but they all don't go into Analysis paralysis and panic with their relationship with it if things go wrong. They don't even need it sometimes and that's ok. Make up ok. Stating \"They Panic,  struggle without it or would not survive...' and other generalisations that all women are the same in their relationship to it is not helpful. Try Equality ...without stereotyping and generalisation including poor assumptions due to poor immature emotional intelligence that shows that studies and approaches used are antiquated.",

I have two big groups of friends (around 50 in one and 35 in another - pretty much all girls). In each, only about three wear makeup regularly. We just have stuff to do; work, school, dance, etc. I like makeup but I don't wear it a lot. \n\nSecond, she's not trying to say she's powerful. She asked if that's what women would decide between, which isn't that bad in itself. But then she says she can go many hours without her phone, in which the men seem shocked and one says ' I don't believe it', which is so condescending. Then when she explains why she can, another man says 'listen and learn ladies' quite loudly, and then she respond with 'boys learn'. And then she says that boys and girls can all learn. Absolutely <b> nothing </b>in that was her saying she was a powerful<b>  woman</b>. She was showing that men and women are on the same level.\n\nLastly, you said everyone knows that women need makeup and men as much as men need women and cars. None of the women I know need makeup. I'm a typical girly girl and I don't need or use it often. As for the men, we're open to them, but a lot of people I know have divorced or are in unhappy relationships. The happiest most successful adult in my life is <b> a woma</b>n who has never married, but doesn't need a man to complete her. The charity work she does is very fulfilling. She's had relationships, but they ended with her feeling very controlled and one threatening suicide if she left him.\n\nI urge you to listen to women and actually talk to them, not put them in a box of a powerf<b> ul wom</b>an feminist stereotype, which you seem to dislike about us\u2665\ufe0f",

Let me put you into an example, such as highschool, there will be some people talking shit to you, and you ignore it. Sure there will be a possibility that it may stop and get bored, but it could also fuel their desires to hurt you more, and probably in a worse way since it will give them the mindset that you're too passive to stand up for yourself and take advantage of it. Which isn't gonna be good for both your feelings, and it could encourage the bully to think that \"its okay\" since some people are just too passive to stand up for themselves, and take advantage.\n\n<b> Sexism,</b><b>  racism</b><b> , homophobi</b>a, misandry/mysogyny, pedophilia, and many other issues are something that we should be aware of since it could make things worse.

Well usually people ask what they want to fucking ask so who is to say its targeted just to piss off women? The other celebrities who whine about what people say they are just fucking opinions do u wana get rid of that serious issue where people are still free to have their own opinions? Maybe those celebrities should just talk to other people and stop whining if they don't enjoy their company or want to answer their questions if they already know they are gonna ask stupid shit. I've never ever heard any<b>  woman</b> whining about an issue like this. Ohh btw just to clarify is this an issue online or actually you know outside of your house? I haven't used facebook or any other shit actively for probably over 4 years cuz its just full of stupid people and shit like this people getting offended left n right and crying about stupid shit. Probably that's why im so clueless about this \"issue\". But just try to go outside stop using social media and throw away your beeping phone meaning stop scrolling through shit and the problems will be gone.

I've read this whole conversation and respect you for your use of logic and the way you two handled this.  What I fail to understand is why it has to be one or the other?  Why must men be weak if women are strong?  Why do we have to trade one's happiness for the other?  Why can't we both get what we want?\nYour comment actually really surprised me; I never thought that good decent men would be truly unhappy with strong women.  (I can understand the rude ones though.)\nI'm not an extreme feminist, and I'm aware that western women aren't oppressed.  All I want from western men is their respect.  I.e., no:\nCat calling\nInappropriate comments/questions\nRape/threats\nCondescension/demeaning\nRudeness, etc.\nNo treating women as if they are shallow.\nAcknowledging their accomplishments with their name attached instead of their husbands.\nThese are simply matters of respect, and none of them are masculine, they are just rude.  I don't see how you can't be masculine and allow a women to be strong; all the avengers cast do it with Scarlet Johansson.  They are clearly ready to stick up for her, and support her when she sticks up for herself.\nI genuinely want men and women to have good relationships and just be happy, and stop fighting.  I am a \"strong\" <b> woman,</b> but I want to be married one day, and to a strong man, at that.  I have<b>  nothing</b> against men, and I don't want to sacrifice their happiness for mine.  What can I do as a strong women for you and other men, to allow you to have your masculinity as well?  How can we coexist?  What do you personally want?

                    "commentText": "@Not Sure Yet Thank you for the respectful reply. And I feel like your heart and mind are in the right place. You are looking for a compromise between both parties. Which is rare imo. Most people really just want to satisfy the primal urge to pwn the other side (me included a lot of times).\n\nI think we should allow women to be as strong as they want. Women are still individuals afterall. I have a deep philosphy that every individual deserves the right to explore their potential. But nature allows the female stereotype to be more socially driven. With men, we are driven by primal urges.\n\nThe trick is not to oppress anyone while not giving into bias. The other trick is finding methods we can all agree on. Women typically value comfort and safety and men typically value the thrill of practice. Outliers still apply of course. And I will get to that in a bit. But there has to be a give and take for how seemingly human we allow ourselves to be. The bitter fact that nature will never let us forget is that we are <b> nothing </b>more than sophisticated animals. We prey on something to survive. Whether its plants or animals, or other people on a social level. It's in our nature to both destroy and create.\n\nBut civilization now dictates that we oppress hateful tendencies. Which factors into a mans drive to a certain degree. If you notice, the angriest SJWs are feminist men.  My pseudo-theory implies displacement of hateful energy.\n\nNaturally, outliers with the most problems make the loudest outcry (Incels, feminists,<b>  LG<b> BT<<b> /b</b</b>>>, etc.). This is natural. Every majority has its outcasts. Civilization literally needs to isolate outliers to incentivize productivity. Which is why we have a two party system. The majority blames one another, while the most isolated of each extreme is frequently challenged. In that challenge, lies the most productive individuals. Which worked for a bit. But if male potential is capped, you wont see productivity. You see raised pressure and more explosions of problems.\n\nI can't speak for women on this. But I think men need the kind of challenge that glorifies our ego. Because what we are facing right now is the kind of challenge that attempts to erase masculine instinct under the guise of comfort and safety. All we are doing is provoking the weaker males into more hostile tendencies. Sorry to say, a functioning system also needs to consider the interests of its most extreme outcasts. Not just because if their productive potential, but destructive as well. They are the rogue elements that get people killed or change the world. And they are most typically males that no one ever acknowledged beforehand.\n\nI get that women are unhappy also. And I get that the ideal of a weaker male means less chances of toxic behavior on a day to day basis. But at the end of the day, mans toxicity needs a outlet. Or else we take it out on women. Especially the ones that make us feel the most insecure or oppressed in our behavior.\n\nYou made one compelling point, about female inventions and their lack of praise. I think the female stereotype is good at working under a system or with systems. Men usually have to establish systems out of discovery or find notivation to follow them. As much as I respect our progress on the matter. Productivity is far more complicated because mass shootings are more worthy of media attention than the countless inventions we made for peace. Sorry to say, men aren't praised for having ideas or creating inventions. We do what we do because we find pleasure in offering relief to others. That's why J.K. Rowlings made such a huge impact with HP. She created something that understood a struggle and provided a vicarious relief through entertainment.\n\nI can go on. But I wrote enough to ask for publishing rights lol. But imo, the reason why men need help is not because we are suffering. We NEED to struggle in tolerable amounts that make sense. I would say the same for women, but you have to deal with us on a daily basis.\n\nSorry for the book response. I can get wordy.",

They should be brought up to work together; educat<b> ed on r</b><b> acism, </b>sexism, whateversism, and taught that it was wrong.\u00a0 They could be a chance to start over, but that won't happen, because we're too busy fighting each other to even consider it.\n\nThe ironic thing is that the same thing keeps happening over and over.\u00a0 Someone always finds some group to be rude to just because they can, and then they retaliate, and we learn that we should respect a new group of people.\u00a0 Guess what kids, we should <b> respect </b>colored people, white<b>  peo</b>ple, old people, young people, male people, femal<b> e p<b> eop</b</b>>le, qu<b> eer </b>people, fat<b>  peop</b>le, AND thin people.\u00a0 Parents, respect your kids. Kids, you also respect your parents. If we made it a policy to just respect ALL people, we wouldn't have to go through it every time.\n\nTo conclude this: It will be hard to find methods we all agree on. I personally say: be respectful, and be good.\u00a0 Can't go wrong with that. There are too many fights going on at once\u2026 people tr<b> ying to</b> fight sexism that isn't even there end up disrespecting someone, which turns into a whole new fight for someone else who's sick of these millennials treating him like dirt.\u00a0 The fights are overlapping, and one side's careless bullets hit way more people than intended.\n\nI think men and women should strive to be more than just men and women.\u00a0 They should strive to be good. Good <b> people.</b> Forget gender roles. Just do th<b> e right</b> thing.\u00a0 Gender differences will appear naturally. They've always been there.<b>  But we</b>'re above gender roles, and we shouldn't have to conform to them.\u00a0 They shouldn't even have to conform to us. Just be good, like, yeet.\n\nWell, I wasn't planning to write an essay today \ud83d\ude02 ^^^\nSorry, I think a lot.",

                    "commentText": "@Not Sure Yet Wow, you are by far my most favorite opponent in political conversation. You are a believer and you have taken human nature to heart. From what you are showing me, you are person worth respecting.\n\nOn the sandwich argument. I can can empathize for that. And as much as I want to advocate freedom of speech, I know how being percieved as lesser is disheartening. And as much as I want to say \"forget those people, they're assholes\", that just keeps the wheel turning. I can see why you chose this argument. The worst thing about it is that there is no real solution present... Except in ways that risk escalation.\n\nI can understand that you want to change male perception towards women. And that will happen in time and with practice. But imo, where the lines need fixing is not in the genders, its in the social status. \n\nCompare the <b> sex </b>life of a well endowed 30 yr<b>  old</b> to a sexually stunted 22 yea<b> r ol</b>d. Who is more likely to satisfy<b>  a wom</b><b> an? </b>Sex is surprisingly relevant to being a male outcast.\n\nFrom my experience also, men resent being told what to do. But give us a reason to care and masculine force can be directed. The best place to start with men is at the scariest center of our core. The parts that make us insecure about women. Re<b> duce se</b>xual abrasion between the genders, you reduce the nee<b> d for s</b>exual abuse.\n\nRespecting all people is a difficult thing. In my experiemce, I can only love and respect so many people at a time. I literally had to acknowledge my inner asshole to function more sanely. And I think t<b> his is </b>common among men. We romanticize love because we don't feel it naturally. We either have certain gifts, find our own methods or find ways to compensate. Worse over, many of those methods or ways have to be misogynistic. We literally have to objectify women in order to communicate the right c<b> ues </b>for sex. Sure, we can respect women and befriend them. But that need for love is so closely re<b> late</b>d to sex, its intoxicating. Those of us that get desperate, we tend to be the worst. Disappointment encourages us to disregard womens needs and focus on our own physical desires.\n\nThe only point I disagree with <b> you on </b>is gender neutrality. Personally, I don't think we s<b> hould h</b>ave gender roles, so long as we understand what each role req<b> uires.</b> If a woman can carry 200+ lbs and wants to be a firefighter, you have my support. She may not be conventionally attractive, due to potential masculine features. But that is no fault of the hers. Nature vs. Nurture traded her strengths. But compare her to a male steretype of brawn > brain. They may be intimidated because such strengths are meant to attract women. You can try to change them, but going against their nature will only make them resent you. Unfortunately, norms vs outliers is far more natural than we will ever want.\n\nYou can post essays btw. In time, I might slow down. But right now, I like discussion. We are both feeding each other rational explanations of our opposing sides. It's healthy imo.",

It's all about women getting equality, it's all about women being oppressed, when no one ever talks about how men are oppressed or the ways men are not equal with women. People aren't even aware that men are oppressed, too. I bet I'm gonna get hate for saying that men are oppressed \ud83d\ude02\nAll feminism is about is women. Umm, can't you put men on the same level of concern as well? I thought modern feminism was about equality. No wait, that's egalitarianism. Feminism literally has the root word \"female\" in it, and egalitarianism has the root word \"equal\" in it.\nStop taking only about women and start talking about men too at an equal level of concern and compassion.\nFeminism these days is hypocrisy.\nAnd disappointing.",

It's always been normal, perhaps even encouraged, to express your feelings and share your experiences in songwriting. \n\nI personally think that the fact that Taylor is able to take something like that and turn it into a masterpiece (or at least something that brings her glory in her career) overshadows everything else.\u00a0\n\nBecause what other people fail to understand is that it is when your emotions are at its strongest that you get the most inspiration for things like songwriting, and Taylor's weaknesses in life seems to be that she is too \"emotional\", right? But she took advantage of that, which is a big part of what made her the successful <b> woman </b>she is today - by taking her weaknesses and turning them into the opposite.",

Women are oversharing when they talk about their exes because they're allowed to talk about them in a daily basis. It boils down to toxic masculinity, Taylor. Yes, men are brave for speaking out what they feel. They are brave for showing us that men actually feel deep. Instead of comparing men's writing about their exes and women writing about their exes, equate them. People feel deeply enough to write about their love lives. Differences in genders don't matter.",

If you dated normal men, no one would care that your songs were about them. Most musicians write songs about their relationships but their relationships are normally about non famous people so no one cares. But when you are dating celebrity after celebrity, of course they are going to keep talking about it! Date a normal man for once and they won't give a shit.",

They don't get any recognition from the world on any of the little work they did.

Or is this just some dumbass SJW video?\nI got the feeling its for real so let me say: the same questions are asked to male celebrities about muscles, cars, their <b> sex </b>life, how tough they are etc.Taylor swift, saying your music is annoying and always about the same<b>  lame</b> subject ha<b> s nothin</b>g to do wi<b> th sexi</b>sm, just be creative sing about some other shit from time to time. They don't say that about Ed Sheeran because he DOES sing about other stuff.\nReally I get some victim SJW vibes from this video. I'm all for equality but some women scr<b> eam sex</b>ism at the weirdest shit. Yes men treat women different than men, but thats in our nature. I'm sorry both male and female have their role in this world, you notice it with literally every animal species, males show off or fight to impress the females, with humans men get the attention by flirting (which is now made sexist while its perfectly normal). If we weren't different there wouldn't be 2 genders now huh? No both man<b>  and w</b>oman have their own roles in 'the circle of life' so they get treated different. Biology is a son of a bitch right?\nAnd I'm not saying women should be treated less than men or that its fair to discriminate them, but men will always look at women with some sort of sexy attractive twist to it. Same goes for women looking at men. Because believe it or not, the different genders exist totally based on reproducing, as for any other animal species. And since men got no 'mating period' and can<b>  hav</b>e sex any time a year, they will alway<b> s ha</b>ve sex with women on their mind.\nAnd of course I don't mean women should be treat<b> ed l</b>ike sex slaves with no opinon who are only good for making kids but I'm saying that thats the reason why we treat each other different and why women get questions about their body and beauty and all that (not saying its fair, but hey it is what is) Now with most animals the male is the <b> dominan</b>t gender, the pack leader, the 'alpha' so thats no exception for humans (not saying women can't lead but mostly men are in charge because well... nature) I mean women want independent strong men who are confident for a reaso<b> n. Scre</b>am sexism all you want, but this is just pure our nature, our biology. This behaviour goes back from the time we lived in caves. Sometimes we forget it, but we are just products of planet Earth. I get that we developed our way of thinking more through the years, but still we can't get rid of that part of the nature inside of us. This was a long comment, I'm sorry but I wanted to share my point of view on this subject. Men and women should totally have the same chances, opportunties and rights in life. But asking men to not talk about <b> women i</b>n a sexual way is like asking the ecosystem to change.",

Also, how could I be ignorant to women when I am one?  By the way, you completely skipped over all the jobs that men are expected to do to over-exaggerate the jobs that women are suppose to do. Also, since when are women expected to be quiet? It's totally not like there is an entire march dedicated to women so they can scream all their problems. All the problems that you listed are REAL problems in the middle-east, but of course you don't want to bring that up because it totally makes your \"problems\" like the wage gap myth or mansplaining seem absolutely ridiculous",

We are all the same no madder what and I wish others thought  the same as well.\n\nWe all madder and it's time to look at each other and start thinking be For we speak or do anything to someone.\nPeople should have learned this in school but no we have people that are out of school acting like they just started. \nMoney, fame,<b>  gender</b>, sexuality, and all of that doesn't define a person it's the things we don't see (but we should show) that make us who we are.\nI'm not even 20 yet think about it.

Obviously, you shouldn't do everything to please everyone else but if you want to portray a certain \"you\" to people then you need to imitate it at least. People don't like Taylor because they feel she dates solely to make music and exploits her exes in the process. But also she uses other popular people in the industry to boost herself up. The only good examples in this video imo are Rihanna and Anne Hathaway.",

Men sometimes take their shirts off, but seldom walk around in tight jeans or hotpants or anything to accentuate their crotches (women have push-up bras). She and the majority of musicians jump around in their music videos and concerts basically in lingerie, the quality of music has only been going down.

The interviewer was trying to point out that the only purpose of the plot was to help pretty spoiled women get away from a warlord when in reality those women wouldn't have lasted a week in the desert without help. The action scenes were great but the movie overall sucked because it was about a loner who only worried about himself all of a sudden cares about some spoiled girls who complain because their only purpose in life was to be a baby mama while others were thirsty and starving.",

This is bad.  Makeup should be viewed like any accessory or adornment....as an embellishment.  But not as a necessity before you can be seen by the rest of the world.  There is <b> nothing </b>WRONG with our naked, natural, unadorned faces, yet far too many women buy into the BS fed us by the beauty 'industry'...that we have so many things on our faces to 'correct'.  \n\nI also note that while it's 'cool' for young women to call themselves 'feminists', they are often hypocrites.  Take the clip of that Taylor Swift video where they are all dressed in sexy<b>  black</b> 'female warrior' outfits complete with high-heeled boots, fully made-up, etc.  Who's kidding who?  Far too many women continue to see themselves as objects, then call themselves a feminist out of the other side of their mouths.  They then say it's about having 'choices'...but yet it's interesting how often their (ahem) 'choice' is to dress like <b> a se</b>x object.  (Halloween is coming up soon.  Let's see how many 'feminist' young women make a 'choice' to wear a 'sexy' costume, versus a non-sexy one.   LOL.  Many women are still very Confused.)",

Every other<b>  woman</b> in this video deserves their applause. Just not Taylor Swift. \n\n\n\n\nAnd to counter the fact that I'm sure all criticisms of her exist only because she's <b> a woma</b>n (as she heavily implies), simply no.

Maybe not having the tough backgrounds like Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury or Johnny cash is stopping her. Those people simply wrote deeper songs. <b> Nobody </b>even knows what Bohemian Rhapsody is about and it still moves people. Maybe it's because she is young. She probably will mature with<b>  age</b> but even in the ex heartbreak song department, she isn't the queen. That \"Someone like you\" song by Adele blows all Swift's heartbreak songs. There is just so much raw emotion in that song. And I have 0 clue on which ex Adele is even talking about. It's all about mystery.",

Everyone has their opinions, and I respect yours. In my opinion \"All too well\" by Taylor is the best heartbreak song in all time. You should listen to it, she perfomed it at grammys ;) I think in case of Taylor people talk about her exes so much, because most of them are famous too, so it causes drama and more views, other artists usually have less famous partners so..",

Women shouldnt sexualise themselves because children might see but because it's highly damaging to everyone. It makes men lose sympathy and compassion for women and makes them think it's Okay to treat them like objects (because they portray themselves as objects). It also makes women feel devalued and only important because of their body. They did a study with a large group of males playing different video games and the guys that played gta were found to have less sympathy for women depicted as a victim. It's disturbing how it can alter someone's brain. \n\nIf only we could show skin in a non <b> sexual </b>way, then women would be able to enjoy their bodies but not in a dehumanising way.",

I just believe a child is only a child if it has innocence and girls like you want to deprive them of that so you can feel comfortable in your own skin by wearing what you want, why do all girls want their asses hanging out, yet, so offended about a pervert.

Do you even think rape and incest victims should be forced to carry to term? What about those who are knowingly carrying a terminal fetus? How sick! There are nuances in this, you know...\n\nOf course preventative conceptions and family planning should be more available.

The problem is that people (men and women) use personal comments and attribute them to a movement that is bigger than any one comment or person. Then it's turned on the movement of women and men fighting for equality. It's really offensive and misogynistic actually. To decide what women can and can't say, what they feel in their hearts and what they choose to do with that. One of the most affected parties that women fight for is <b> homosexual </b>men, for example. But no one seems to care about that because they are seen as \u2018feminine'....it's a cycle of nonsense. Honestly, if you all want to fight about what constitutes a real or fake feminist, go for it. We'll be out pounding the streets for change",

The reason why some people (people who know facts) want abortions to be legal it's because: kids in poverty would reduce, <b> mental </b>health for a traumatize and violated women and because the baby is either not going to make it or might kill the mother. Also... People tend to say to just give it to adoption but there's almost no one helping orphanages and some kids never get adopted. There is also the time when women entered crisis and tried to abort themselves, making themselves infertil or getting an infection and dying. There is so much more behind abortion that just \"killing an innocent\". I know it's bad as it is but think of the bigger consequences that brings.",

Please read a couple books or watch a documentary on feminism before deciding you have enough information to form a valid opinion. This will be expected of you in the adult world.",

They are jobs that look for women but sometimes men take the jobs because most men are likely to compete for them.\n3: men are more competitive-if a <b> woman </b>and a man are at work the man is more likely to compete and show his boss how good he is than the<b>  woman</b>. \n4: men are more likely to die-men work more dangerous jobs and this doesn't count the military and even if the military's were added men would still have the higher death count.\n5: men are more likely to ask for raise-men are more likely to ask their boss for raises and negotiate than women.\n6: men work on sick days more-when a man and <b> a woma</b>n are sick, the man is more likely to go to work sick than t<b> he wom</b>an, women usually stay at home most men don't.\n7: men take less holidays-women mostly take holidays every 10 months and men every 12.\n8: men retire at older ages-In the 60s men retired at 65 while women retired at 50 now men are more likely to retire at least 5 years afte<b> r a wo</b>man.\n And they are many more if you don't believe me you could research it if you want to. Another thing if companies could actually pay women less for t<b> heir ge</b>nder why don't they just hire women?? Well simple they don't, they don't pay them less because of <b> their g</b>ender they pay them less cause all the things I listed above and maybe more, oh yeah and all the things that I listed don't have to do with toxic masculinity, as you can see it's mostly women fault so how about instead of feminist blaming everything on men how about they start changing themselves if they truly want to change.",

I mean a lot of the women in this video I don't necessarily believe to be 'feminazis', the overly sensitive ones, perhaps, but its true that feminists are really about being together and not bringing other women down, and not ignoring the general rights of human beings. Feminists are not overly focused on themselves and are aware the world is at times very problematic for everyone in different ways, but are just putting extra focus on modern day problems for women, yet still keeping concern for men as we both suffer in different ways, although I think most of us can agree it really is more problematic for women in many different ways (not all ways, of course). Its not 'women vs men' and its not all about 'us, us, us' and the women who have this viewpoint are certainly incorrect and are sexist themselves, and are, of course, bringing down the reputation of feminists who are simply trying to do good from an equal viewpoint.",

She is also fairly controversial, which is what I find irritating about her, her most recent album literally surrounds all of her controversies. This is why she is so successful, not because her music is of a high quality, not because her lyrics are meaningful and her melodies are beautiful. I'm not doubting her star power, but I have the right to criticise her music without being referred to as illiterate. I don't have to like her music, I don't have to think that it's good, I am entitled to think that it's crap. \n\nI can read btw x",

You need to learn to accept the fact that people are allowed to like/dislike music... yes, even music that you enjoy!! My opinion is NOT fact, I am very aware - but that doesn't mean I'm not allowed to state it with conviction. You may think that your statements aren't opinion based, but ofc they are. You're using your opinion as a juggernaut, literally telling me that I am 'spreading hate' because I disagreed with you. I don't hate Taylor Swift, or her fans... But I still think most of her new music is crappy and I still think that's why she gets so much heat. \n\nAs a feminist, I stated this opinion because I don't like the idea of something being tarnished as sexist if it may not necessarily be sexist, when there are so many REALLY sexist issues that we already need to deal with. SOOOO many women write songs about their relationships, practically every artist does it. Think about it, Taylor has been doing it for years. In the <b> old </b>days she probably didn't receive half of the critique that she does for it now. PERSONALLY, I put that down to a decline in quality  of her music and the fact that she literally feeds off of this controversy.<b>  Sexism</b> is about patterns, and there is a lack of repetition in this \u2018pattern'. No other female singers are constantly bashed for writing songs about their exes, just her. There has to be a reason for this. Just because she is successful, doesn't mean that any claims that her quality of music has diminished are groundless. Stop telling me how to think, it's seriously annoying.",

The phrase is supposed to mean that women won't uselessly and meaningless degrade or insult one another. It does NOT mean that you're not allowed to get mad at each other over valid things. Taylor Swift calls herself a victim every time someone calls her out for her legitimate BS. Telling other women not to \"tear each other down\" is some stupid shit when it's coming from someone who regularly manipulates her audience into thinking she's a victim so that she can call herself a \"feminist\" for clout.",

Many men suppress and neglect this side of them due to society and humankind's history, but to embrace the feminine side is to be whole in the being. Femininity and masculinity must both be embraced for the world to be truly balanced, and at the moment, it is a bit lopsided towards masculinity. One Day we can become one, and that is why our goal is to embrace our Femininity through Feminism.",

This is how I know her even though I don\u00b4t listen to her music, you can find it bad or not. The same way Ed Sheeran is known as the ginger or many people refer to other people as \"the nerd\" or \"the one with freckles\", etc. It is how we describe people or reference people.  Sometimes it is ironic and sometimes people really don\u00b4t put much effort into it. But calling it <b> sexism,</b> like in that specific case is wrong and also dangerous because using that word too often in the wrong context is kind of inflationary. I can see how she might not like it, but don\u00b4t call it<b>  sexism</b>, that makes it worse.",

I saw that they ask different questions in the Scarlet Johansson sample of the clip and agree and she is totally right with her response. But in this case, I see the context. Your statement, saying no man is asked the same kind of question Rihanna is asked is not completely true. The lead singer of Coldplay, Maroon 5 and My Chemical Romance also have been asked about that many times. I agree, that this is not relevant at all and I think these questions don\u00b4t deliver any value whatsoever.",

I'm not saying that it was okay for scarlett's interviewer to ask that question. Quite the opposite, actually. I'm saying, why is it okay for the female interviewer to ask about the male actor's underwear?? I just don't get why men are allowed to be sexualized while women aren't. \nBy the way, I, myself, am a female who believes in <b> gender </b>EQUALITY. And not trying to put females over males, which a lot of sexist people assume 'feminist' means.",

Women's bodies have been sexualized for centuries, and it is not uncommon for girls to have to hear that question, usually with some amount of judgement or bad intention behind it. I have heard it myself, when I have had to wear a gown that can't be used with underwear. Now I would dare to say that question is not asked to most men in their entire lives, and if it is it carries a different meaning, mostly genuine curiosity, not judgement or sexualization.",

Celebrity journalists are fully aware of this so they tend to this obsession for the purpose of getting more viewers. It's their job, and I think celebrity journalists are trash for wanting a job that involves appealling to this sort of intrusive curiosity in some people. But it's the celebrity obsessed viewers who are the biggest trash of them all. Like it's possible to be a fan and also respect someone's privacy, but not if you're a cunt.",

This video is beautiful and is everything that needs to be said but somehow people are able to twist that and turn it into something it isn't. The concept of being equal is not always the answer because people still find ways into manipulating that into something worse and sometimes forget that men have rights too. The past chivalry of men standing up to let women sit down isn't as much present anymore as it is now because now some would take it offensively when a person us just trying to be nice whether it's a male or female. I just felt like I need to say that what applies in this video doesn't apply to all thing, terms or problems.",

But we're still not quite there in term of social equality and having an equal amount of problems. There's still a lot of what I call casual <b> sexism </b>in society. For example in the psychological struggle of a lot of women. We're a bit hardwired to think and do things a certain way, because of our education in this culture. It's not some really hard and vicious thing like it could be in a third world country but there's a lot of time when we would impulsively act one way and then take a step back and just think \"wtf why do I do that. I don't need to do that, it's not my place it's just stupid\". With kids for example or with cleaning, just responsibilities as a whole. Even if people don't come up to us and tell us to do them or to take them we just tend to because a part of us think that we should. \n\nThere's still some social behavior between men and women in everyday life that is a testimony of cultural<b>  sexism</b> so I really wouldn't say bot<b> h gende</b>r have an equal amount of problems. At least if we talk <b> to gend</b>er related problems because of cours<b> e a bl</b>ack man with for example disabilities, a lot of trauma and an unstable income is probably gonna have more problem than a healthy white girl with a rich investor dad. \n\nBut yeah I do think culturally there's still a lot of things that are fucked and that I hope will be fix because it comes from society and especially our education from the past so maybe our daughter will have that equality that we seek but it's hard to have it for ourselves with the education we got. I mean it just makes sense. Progress is going fast but we're talking about thousands of years of inequality<b>  and se</b>xism here it's not gonna fix itself in one hundred years.",

Feminism is about equality. Taylor swift writing about her love life of her personal live doesnt make her not feminist! And just because she wrote bad blood, doesnt mean that she aint a feminist, if it is a angry song...then so be it. Anger is a basic human emotion! If you dont feel angry ever...then something is wrong with you!\nAgain Feminism = Fight for Equality!",

For example, what is the biggest insult you can say to someone in middle school? ''You run like a girl!'' or ''Don't be such a girl''.\n''Girl'' is literally used as an insult by young kids, because thats how they're raised. And when they are older, they go from ''don't be such a girl'' to ''Don't be such a pussy''.\nAnd before I see any comments being like ''I sUpPorT fEmiNisM jUsT nOt FeMinAzi'' theres no such thing as ''modern feminism'' or ''feminazi''. A word doesn't change meaning, it means the same thing it did 70 years ago. A feminist is someone who wants men and women to be equals<b> , nothin</b>g else. Someone who is a ''man hater'' or whatever the fuck you wanna call it, ARE NOT FEMINISTS. They're *Chauvinists*. \n\nWhy is that so hard to understand?? If<b>  a na</b>zi said ''I'<b> m a n</b>azi, but I don't mind jews'' does that mean th<b> at ''</b>nazi'' suddenly means people who don't mind jews? No. It means the exact same thing it did before, cause a word can't change meaning because of people who misuse it. Man-haters aren't feminists, so every time you use feminism as an insult or make fun of it, you're not only making fun of the thousands of child brides being sold off and r*ped by grown men every single day, you're also being straight up sexist. End of fucking story.",

Empowerment is about cheering women on but its also about standing up against someone that wronged you (whatever your opinion is about her being actually wronged idc for). This someone (that has wronged you) could be anyone boy or girl and deserves the same treatment, which is true for taylor. She writes songs.  It wasnt a diss track it was simply showing her disappointment in a friend she thought betrayed her. The same thing being true for swish swish. Who made it a petty cat fight? the media.

I believe the core values of traditional feminism are great, but executed in a really poor way in modern times, just because of all the hate towards men.\nI do however, believe in true equality, and equal respect both from men towards women, and women towards men. I am all about everyone supporting everyone.\nI don't believe in a certain group having legal priviliges over the other. I don't believe in ruining another person's life over accusations that have not been proven.\nAgain, I am all about supporting each other, and hate towards any group, be it awesome men, or beautiful women disgusts me.",

Blackmailing is illegal. Even if it wasn't, it's about morals. I feel sorry for your female familiars, to have such a sick person so close... You want power? That's not what you obtain from blackmailing someone. Blackmail, abuse, violence... That's not power. It's being a shitty person. What you obtain is a temporary fear. Wait until the tables get turned. If you send that picture to someone, you can easily go to jail. Gosh, just reading your comments made me feel so sick.

Of course there are some who ask sexist questions, but that doesn't mean a celebrity should avoid all interviews like Beyonc\u00e9 does. The great thing about interviews is that they're one of the few ways to get insight on what a celebrity is really like because the interviewer can ask the subject uncomfortable (but hopefully not sexist) questions and push back on their answers. Thought-provoking questions can lead to responses that reveal things about a celebrity's personality we might otherwise not know.",

Her lyrics always talk about what the other person did wrong and it comes off really aggressive. I was a HUGE Taylor Swift fan, so no hate at all, but over time and with all of the interviews she has speaking on the subject of <b> sexism </b>with her lyrics, I've realized that (for me at least) that it has<b>  nothing</b> to do wit<b> h sexis</b>m and everything to do with how she portrays herself in the media.

The two are not synonymous , You can be a Boss <b> chick </b>and not be a bitch.. It's the WAY you come across\nRihanna... She asked you a simple question that any man would get asked as well .. Are you looking for a man.. Men get asked if they are looking for a Women..We do and you handled it terribly\nAnd Oh good lord Ariana.. you twisted the heck out of that question which was meant as a playful game, \"What could you not live without phone or make up\" In your hyper feministic mind that turned into IS THIS WHAT YOU THINK WOMEN THINK ABOUT... um no, he asked that because the majority of US (me included) millennials are vein and addicted to there phones ... Your rediculous..\nI'm being a little harsh here but this world needs a little harsh with how<b>  crazy</b> my generation is getting offended all the time.

All she complains about is how women always fight and how sexist society portrays women for writing break up songs when really it's just her complaining about how people portray her. Whitney Houston wrote break up songs. Fergie wrote break up songs. Mariah Carey wrote break up songs and did they get shit for it? Fuck no! The reason why people joke about her dating other guys and writing songs about them is because she had a record of how many celebrity men she has dated. She even wrote about them and made It public for her to sell out. It may be an <b> old </b>joke but her break up songs are still out to buy and listen. I think it's petty and I don't respect her for that.",

It's considered sexist because it's not a comment than men ever really get from strangers because let's be honest it's a <b> weird </b>comment to make. But somehow it's okay for a lot of people to say it to women. It's not sexist because it's being targeted to women or being an insult, it's not sexist in theory but in the reality it's actually a comment people make because it's expected of women to always smile and be pretty or beautiful even when they have bad day and it's not a requirement in their job but it's not for men at all.",

But to ONLY ever be asked about garments meant to cover a part of her which is meant for <b> SEX </b>and is called a vagina then yeah definitely a sexist and vagina  obsession question. \n\nImagine if someone asked The Rock\n'Do you wear underwear?'\nNo. They do not.\n\nThey only ask how much they worked out, what they ate etc.\nBut they move on to other q's.",

The fact that man does not give birth doesn't change the fact that the child is also his. \n\n\" if the man doesn't want a kid he can give full custody to the mother and stop sleeping with women unprotected\"\n\nyes he can however the women can still sue for child support, while in the womens position if she does not want the child she can just kill the fetus. additionally \"stop sleeping with women unprotected\" is a valid point but not on its own. the same can be said about a women just dont let a man sleep with you without protection or do not do so at all. \n\n\"Shit, even a corpse has more body rights than women\"\n\nyour last retort was illogical and untrue.",

You aren't.\"\nfor your first point i never said or suggested that, however you can make the argument that women arent entitled to their own bodies either, the same goes for men. such a concept is subjective and incredibly complex abstract concept. meaning that humans basically at some point just decided people should have some degree or control over their own bodies, but there is no evidence to suggest such a decision is just or correct thats subjective.",

And it doesn't matter if you said army or something else bts related, it's the same thing. I'll give another example. It's like being at a funeral then talking about how you think McDonalds is so great. It's not right for the situation and you could wait another time. Now m not that mad that you said \u2018army.'

While actually feminism should be that women and men can decide for themselves what they want and should be accepted (as long as they are not hurting others). I mean, we want to fight for equality as a group, but some people are just trying to shame and hurt other women while claiming to be feminist :(",

Also, just because she is a feminist and says women shouldn't be tearing each other down, does not mean she should tolerate the shit women do to her?? like what she said was general but that doesn't mean she doesn't have her own personal problems with men and women. And she never dragged every ex ever down, she says what she feels about them also quite vaguely and most of the time she tells people how she feels or even blames herself for it, like Back to December or I knew you were trouble. She writes cute songs and cool songs and if that is not your taste or upto your understanding I suggest you leave without making a damn statement about your bullshit opinion which is shallow and irrelevant, thanks!",

Doesn't matter if you have \"bad blood\", you sort those problems out. Taylor, apparently, didn't...and went on to make a song about it. The ironic thing?

Never once did she come for Katy's success. She came for Katy with an entire league of her \"Swift Squad\" behind her in the video instead and made cash off the ongoing feud before Katy ever did.

She said publicly that Forever and Always is about Joe Jonas, she admitted that Better Than Revenge was about Camila Belle, she even fucking named John Mayer and Harry Styles in songs. She left the lyrics in Bad Blood vague because she was going for an anthem vibe, hence why the chorus is full of layers. But people will run with whatever they want and Taylor has always stayed silent when she doesn't want to discuss the subject of songs. People STILL think I Knew You Were Trouble is about Harry Styles even though it was released before they started dating and she lets people think that because she doesn't want to discuss it, and that's her own choice. She doesn't have to do answer to other people who speculate about her lyrics, especially when they treat her songs like paternity tests.\n\nShe didn't like Katy. You don't have to sort things out if you don't feel like you did anything wrong. It's misogynistic to expect all women to either love each other or to hate each other. Women are human, it's okay to not like a girl if she wrongs you and it's okay to feel hurt. If she doesn't want to associate with Katy, why would you force her to? If a <b> woman </b>doesn't want to associate with another<b>  woman</b>, what does it matter to you if it isn't affecting you?\n\nThe Bad Blood music video has literall<b> y NOTHIN</b>G to do with Katy. The song itself was inspired by that situation, but the overall song is a song about general betrayal from a friend, and the video is about bouncing back from that betrayal with the support of many women. \n\nAlso, that attempted dig at Taylor writing about her relationships is... lmao. Every single songwriter in history has written about their past relationships, but Taylor Swift does it and apparently she's using people. Even Katy does it, and there<b> 's nothi</b>ng wrong with that. Songwriting is about expressing your feelings when you need to the most, and there's absolut<b> ely noth</b>ing wrong with writing about heartbreak, love, betrayal, friendships, family, death, etc.\n\nAgain, keep reaching and keep taking situations out of context without looking into the details.",

Katy Perry was the one who said it was about her and started using that as promotion. The lyrics did not point to anyone as they were not meant to down another <b> woman,</b> but to convey that she felt betrayed and that it is okay to feel mad at betrayal. Taylor has said before that she does not like getting mad at people, and never in person, so when she decides someone is not worth talking to due to repeated mistreatment, she cuts that person out of her life. And, she included her friends in the video because she wanted to commemorate their friendship. If 99.9999999999999% of people who have met or are friends with Taylor Swift say she is genuinely a nice person, than I'd rather take that opinion rather than the butthurt one of someone who doesn't know her and probably hasn't even met her.",

She literally promoted the love of fellow women and the appreciation for powerful women. In addition, releasing her <b> old </b>catalogue on Spotify is not sabotaging an album. Katy Perry's Witness album didn't do as well as it could have due to it not having as much mainstream appeal. However, the album did still do very well.

You ignore the facts that she put her fans against Katy Perry, gave interviews about it, choosing the exact same day Katy Perry's album release on Spotify even though this mess she created happened years ago. The thing is, you come up with really good points about feminism, which Taylor Swift wholly lacks. She was never a feminist and never will be. Like I said, if feminism is about fighting for equal rights, but at the same time bashing other women, you and your idol TS got this idea all wrong. That's why she can't fix her reputation anymore. After her never ending feud with Kim Kardashian, Kanye, Katy Perry and god knows who, she is long way far from being recognized as a feminist. If you think she is, then every character in Mean Girls is the same. Cheers!",

During High school she was not one of the popular kids, (her words) in face she was a dweeb. Most likely she was the butt of their jokes. Her desire to be part of the popular was so strong she has recreated it in adulthood. No, it want a cry for family believing/bond because from her own words she had a normal upbringing. What she created was a highschool-esque \"clique.\" Basically she is desperately trying to relieve the version of high school that played in her head when she was a teen The evidence of this is typically, she has surrounded herself with (mostly) tall models types, who  probably were popular in high school, the recreation of it through the bad blood video. It's her artistic attempt at getting revenge over all who have doubted her (not just Katy perry). Except, it's kinda sad because there's no need for it, she is a grown ass <b> woman </b>and should rely on the crutches of her adolescent desires. The wrongs against her (the crap she gets about writing about her ex's) is just her. It's not a secure thing, it's a taylor thing. Artists like Beyonce, Adele, all write about the men in their life. They don't get stick for it. It's just her, but she's turning it into a<b>  sexual</b> thing because she doesn't have th<b> e menta</b>l capacity to understand, it's just her.",

Are you supposed to limit yourself to one or two to please others? No. She has a lot of friends, and has had them for years. Also, the only reason she has a few model friends is because that was who she interacted with by playing at the Victoria Secret Fashion Show twice.

She writes songs about her life since she was like 11. If someone cheats on her she's not gonna write a song saying \"oh poor him, he must be confused, it's not his fault :(\". And also literally all the songs where she \"attacks\" people she's dated were written when she was a teenager and people grow up you know? Her songwriting is so much mature in her recent albums. Do you actually listen to her album and all her lyrics or you just come up with all this bullshit out of your ass to fit the anti-Taylor agenda?",

Bad Blood didn't try to humiliate or tear down whoever she was singing about. She was simply stating that she has beef with someone who did her dirty and felt betrayed.

This hypocritical approach is unfortunately a role model for the teens which are basically her only fan group. So as to their role model, if they feel like another girl did them wrong, just start a fight, bully them, maybe even choose violence just like in her music video, and be a part of a squad with nearly anorexic girls, btw you won't make it to the group unless you're popular etc. Fan girls are so <b> blind </b>to see these facts so they just eat it up.

Emma Watson - shallow and phony (I don't know her obviously so this is just one person's perspective) and also untruthful.  Modern day feminism IS all of those things she mentioned.  Maybe what she meant was that feminism used to be about things like equality, and that she, Emma, wishes it still was.  And Emma, if you don't know what your tits have to do with modern day feminism I'm wondering what do you know?\n3.  Taylor Swift - Really Taylor?  You're just going to say these lies so innocently and convincingly?  There's this really famous rapper you might have heard of, his name is Eminem.  Well he wrote a bunch of songs and he was definitely accused of \"over sharing\", people just had a more disrespectful way of saying it.  He was called <b> crazy </b>and many other things.  Oh and \"watch out, he'll put you in a song\" has been said many times about Eminem.  And the fact that he wrote songs about his ex was criticized from all angles.  You're right Taylor, SUCH<b>  sexism</b>.  For the sake of the few honest and genuine women left out here and the few men whose souls have yet to be sucked out by rage filled, controlling, jealous and manipulative savages all wrapped up in a pretty box with a bow, please stop talking about important issues.\n4.  Nicki Minaj - I couldn't have said it better myself Nicki.  You are so right.  When <b> a woma</b>n is assertive she is definitely a being a bitch.  And when is a man is assertive he's a boss.  Because a man knows how to be assertive and<b>  a wom</b>an typically doesn't.  Then she hilariously says this gem \"no negative connotations behind being bossed up, but lots of negative connotations behind being a bitch\"... Hmmm, I wonder why Nicky? Haha.\n5.  Ariana.  Wha<b> t a d</b>umb question guys.\n6. Serena.  Why you so afraid to <b> be a w</b>oman?\n\n#whyarewomensodelusional",

There's a difference between singing romantic songs about exes and rapping about stapling someone's balls \n4. See, you're a part of the problem. A <b> woman </b>knowing what she wants and how to get it is something negative to you, meanwhile if a man would do it it's positive. Going again with the<b>  lame</b> excuses I've heard. Saying men has an innate quality to make them more assertive? What? No statistics prove that. Ever. Once again, opinions aren't facts.",

I wasn't talking about Rihanna (yes that's how it's spelt, not rehana) but I was talking about you sexualizing female superheroes as all they do is kick ass and not try to be that sexy.\nAnd I don't like Katy Perry or her songs and that music video was <b> weird,</b> but just because of one person you shouldn't think that all women think the same and just 'sell sex'. Some people have self respect and they show that, like Gal Gadot, Michelle Obama and Ellen Degeneres for example, so don't you go generalizing females saying we're all dirty chicks",

I NEVER said that women can't dislike other women\n2. I NEVER said it was sexist\n3. I ONLY mentioned what I said CAUSE she said that women shouldn't tear other women down yet her song, Bad Blood says otherwise. So she's basically going back on what she said! She's being hypocritical in a way.\n\nTHERE NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND MY COMMENT??",

Sparks fly, back to  December, enchanted,  love story,  Begin Again, everything has changed,  call it what you you want,  new years's day and ect were  more  about her mistakes and the  positive aspects of a romantic relationship.  The problem is that people get upset with Taylor for singing about her love life but don't get upset when Bruno sings about how he should have gotten flowers for a girl or how <b> sex </b>with a <b>  woman</b> takes him to paradise.",

Literally out of all her love songs (which is only around 20 our if 140+) only about 5 are her speaking about then in a not so good way. And that only because she had bad experiences with her past relationships. If someone cheated on you and you were writing a story about your life would you lie and say that the relationship was amazingly wonderful. And she dosent even really bash her past boyfriends at all really. She only describes what she feels during those periods in her life. I know this because I actually listen to her music rather than just listen to what the general media has to say about her. And people tend to believe she's the bad <b> crazy </b<b> >chick</b> because she's a tall beautiful straight whit<b> e woma</b>n that seems to have it all. I know because before listening to her music I use to have that mentality as well.\n\nI decided to actually really listen to her music because I realized some time ago that I formed this habit of judging people based mostly on appearance rather than their actual actions or personality first. So yeah",
