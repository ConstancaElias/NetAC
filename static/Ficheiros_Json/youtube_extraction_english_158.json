It's sad, but I've seen many comments by aspiring coders (and other IT disciplines) who say, \"I'm 22 but feel bad because Linus Torvalds started programming at age 10, do you think it's too late for me to become a programmer?\" LOL?\n\nI enjoy seeing diversity in the IT sector of YouTube, regardless of age.",

Playing and modding Fallout4 or Skyrim, listening to and watching Rammstein or Judas Priest, trying to produce some music on my DAW etc etc..... and I'm PC guy too - since DOS and Win3.1. So happy to finally get in 'touch' with a guy like you. Currently on disability due  to cancer, COPD and other 'crap', but feel the same way as you - inside I'm still in my 20's - ha ha. Thank you soooo much for what you doing !!!",

I, however,  possess an analytical ability which I witnessed recently when helping my 13 year old solve a problem with a video program. I do observe that he normally catches on very quickly on how to use the program but my ability to solve and analyze is by no means diminished. In fact my analytical ability is strong. Apart from some body pain I don't think I am old, even using the word \"old\" strikes me as odd. So keep up the good work and keep spreading the good words and information.",

I love how youngsters now look at me as though I have not got a clue... (ok that may be accurate...) yet.. have no idea what my background is, nor what amount of gear I have used and currently use now....  When the kids do see what I have it's like a major wake up call.... Have to agree with you on tech for ages though... there is certain tech that is aimed at a younger market... be it wearables... fashion etc.. yet... people in our age bracket... we seem to be getting left behind somewhat on the tech front... Tech Jackets... I want a pocket for wallet, glasses, keys, and THEN tech LOL!!! Anything on my wrist... if there is a way of looking at it without glasses... THEN its of interest! Ands thats the thing... until you get to a specific age and have to deal with the changes that come with it.. you really cannot appreciate... what is going to eventually come to us all!",

I still work as a database administrator and software developer and still love the technology.  I'm working on a Microsoft database certification to help with whatever age discrimination I run across in the job market.  Do technical certifications guarantee or prove anything?  No they don't, but it can't hurt.  I think part of age discrimination comes down to money.  Companies say they want fresh ideas from young people.  While that may be true in some cases, I believe that in most cases they can hire young people for less money and that's why they want to get rid of the older, better paid employees.

    "commentText": "Very interesting topic Bruce.  I’ll offer my opinion regarding this, because\nsurely one opinion video welcomes the opinion of a viewer.  More and more “older” folk (by which I think officially classed anybody over 50 is classed as “old”) are getting on the\nInternet – probably due to their jobs, and just because that’s the way the world is going.  Now people over the age of 70, things are very different – older people around that age have probably used a computer, but it’s been very limited, and the chances of them owning one in their house is probably as lot lower than somebody twenty years\nyounger.  I wouldn’t say the Internet is just for younger people because when it was initially created, many of us didn’t even exist (myself included), but certain sites; such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Twitch, and even a lot of gaming services such as Steam, I would imagine have a lot more younger users, probably a large majority of people under\nthe age of 40.  It reminds of another English guy over here on Twitch, I can’t remember his exact name now, but at the time he was 67 and was streaming and playing Battlefield, and wasn’t half bad either.  A lot of YouTuber’s tend to be younger, and by that I suppose at the very most are under 40 – I’m not saying all, but just most.  Does it bother me?  No, it’s great to see more people online and enjoying themselves and expressing their creativity.  Does ageism itself exist?  Well, I would imagine so as YouTube itself is deemed something for the younger people. \nI myself also use YouTube instead of watching TV, whereas my parents watch TV in the evenings – this also makes me wonder about the future of cable TV itself when online services such as Netflix are coming out, and you can watch what you want, when you want (without commercials?  I don’t use Netflix).  I do think the Internet in regards to the future is going to be a lot more of a service and in our lives a lot more than cable TV ever was, and with services such as Skype will telephone services also cease to exist as  everything goes online? Certainly very interesting indeed.\n\nWas the hat just ‘because you had it sitting around’?  ;)  As you said in your video, it’s nice to see older people using technology, which I can see as being ageist, but at the same time I also think it’s bad to see younger people using technology, and I’m talking about those tablet devices made for small children.  They should be outside having fun, scuffing their knees, eating mud and just doing what children do!\n\nTalking about different ages and employment I’m going to talk about my father.  He works (or did, he’s a manager now) in the haulage industry – his company are having problems,\nas is most of the haulage industry getting people my age into it...Older people are retiring, and not enough people are going into the industry to take up the slack.  I think the average age of drivers is 51.  As for my dad’s company before they started offering an apprenticeship scheme I think the youngest person, at least in the UK side of the company was 34.  Most were aged between 45-55.\n\nAs for that ‘too old to learn anything new’, well to an extent, rather worryingly I’ve reached that point myself.  Don’t get me wrong, I love technology, but certain aspects...VR, smart watches, Google Glass and other devices like that, I really don’t want it forced down my throat. Maybe I’m just stubborn, but I’d rather have a computer for computing tasks, and then when I’m out to get away from it.  I own an iPhone, but it’s only ever connected to WiFi when I’m at home...As soon as I go out all my social networking sites stop – if people want me, they can call me. \n\nI’ve often thought of going the same way Dave Cullen at computingforever has and getting a non-smartphone, but at the same time I’d still like to use Snapchat and Instagram – which is probably the primary use of my phone as it is.  A lot of people my age don’t really do telephone calls anymore, or text...They might ask to FaceTime (similar to Skype – you can see each other’s faces), but that’s about all.\n\nI think that as long as you use technology to assist, and don’t allow it to take over, then yes – you can have a better life by incorporating it and using it to it’s potential.  Great video Bruce, and you’re not “too old” –keep at it, and keep having fun with it!  Happy Easter, and I hope that you and your family have a fantastic weekend.",

    "commentText": "Hey Bruce, that camera footage does look very very nice.  There should be a setting to lock exposure and white balance for when shooting indoors. I got my PJ440 and just set the exposure and white balance. Then just make a preset in FCP to key those in each time. \nNow young man lets talk about age.. LOL.. Your not old, yea your 18 years older then I but heck, I got grey hair popping out each day as well, plus this horrid bald spot on top. But dont let age ever get you down. Once you stop living life is when you will stop living life. Ya know I think my mental age stopped at 25, but I spent over 6 years in the military since age 21. So I guess I got a lot of good life lessons in a short amount of time to help me make better decisions now. But my love for things and how I see the world, life and people around me never moved past that. I am a little more out of shape these days. But if I was still in the same shape I was then, life at least in my eyes would keep moving on the same around me. I am often shocked when I see photos on Facebook of kids of my friends that are not kids anymore. Their in high school or even college. I am normally left wondering, damn, did I just sleep ten years away. Where did the time go.\nWhat is sad though is the time it takes to foster a carrier these days. Heck lets look at this YouTube thing we both go going on or any real business for that matter. Takes 5 years to get it up to full speed. Then about another 5 more to set it in stone. Thats 10 years gone, 1/10th of our life expectancy. At least for 1/10th for those of us who don't smoke or drink like a fish. IDK, but then again if we wasn't doing something, that would be equally as bad. \nAnyway, I dont see you as old(er). I see you as Bruce. A wonderful person who has videos I enjoy and a person I hope to meet one day. So ignore the trolls, lord knows they been around since the days you and I were logging into BBS's on our old Hayes or Wang 1200bps modems. Often they are just the asshurt kids of democrats that just need a well placed mule kick in the face. So dont let their BS get to you. Make sure you drink your ensure and take care ;-)  Joe",

I think you're age is a massive advantage, because you've experience in both business and technology, and you've seen technology grow from its infancy, while our generation only gets to experience it in its current state. I'd say that on top of your personality makes you videos worthwhile for a lot of people.",

And on top of that unpaid (but obligatory) overtime. I downsized as soon as the kids where raised and I'm now better off with more money in my pocket. We are all sucked into taking on debt, keeping up with the joneses, paying bills, 'upgrading' and the big one, healthcare and a really big one, childcare. Older people are free to reject a lot of that if they are willing to look at their expenses and in my case, I am part self employed in tech and part time employed in a mundane non tech job and I'm coining it. NO to debt, credit cards etc and YES to quality of life . The only people with an iphone 6 I know, are 2 little girls under 10, who got them as presents, they have no sim in them but wave them about every time some one stops to talk to them. One of the fathers is declared bankrupt. I only buy new tech when it actually makes sense. I keep up with new stuff but I don't necessarily buy unless it's vital. I've still got a first gen moto g, off plan, so again cheap and it still has all the bells and whistles I need. The people who had it all, were our parents generation.",
