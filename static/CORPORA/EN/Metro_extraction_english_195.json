        "postText": "A McDonald\u2019s customer was left with a shattered cheekbone and nose after a restaurant manager hurled a huge blender at her face.', 'Britany Price was struck hard on the face with the kitchen tool after hurling her order at the worker at the McDonald\u2019s in Colerain Township, Ohio, on September 22.', 'Price, who has undergone surgery to repair the damage caused, said: \u2018I wanted to get some Happy Meals and some cheeseburgers and that was a very unhappy day for me.\u2019', 'The incident began when Price used the restaurant\u2019s drive-thru to order some food \u2013 only to then discover she\u2019d been given the wrong thing.', 'Price went back in to the restaurant to complain, but lost patience after being left unattended for 23 minutes.', 'She then hurled the bags of food at the worker, only for the manager to hit back with an airborne blender, which struck Price\u2019s face so hard she was knocked to the ground.', 'Price told WPBF: \u2018It\u2019s like, you\u2019re directly ignoring me, so what choice do I have? I don\u2019t have to put up with this.', '\u2018So, I went and got the food, I want my money back and that\u2019s kind of where it all goes from there.\u2019', 'Asked if she regretted hurling the blender, Price added: \u2018I mean, I definitely don\u2019t feel like there would have been a different result.', '\u2018I feel like even if we would have just went verbal back and forth that it still would\u2019ve escalated to something else.\u2019', 'The injured customer\u2019s lawyer has now filed a civil lawsuit against McDonald\u2019s.', 'A spokesman for the restaurant said: \u2018The safety of our customers and employees is of utmost importance to us.', '\u2018We are looking into this matter and will take the appropriate steps once our investigation is complete.\u2019",

How would you like it your child had their face smashed just because they threw food at someone? I bet you'd feel different then. She was quite right to abandon her order after being kept waiting. I often abandon shopping where I am standing if the checkout staff are too busy gossiping or fooling around or generally just wasting time or not doing their job. Why should I reward them with my custom if they want to waste my time like that? The only thing this <b> woman </b>did wrong was throw food at them, but the staff should've left it for the police to deal with instead of taking the law into their own hands. And the people in these comments should be arrested for inciting violence.",
