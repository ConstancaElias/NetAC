        "postText": "When she presented The Truth About Menopause, Mariella had no idea it would generate such a strong reaction. She is approached wher-ever she goes \u2013 mostly by women but some men too \u2013 eager to talk about a process that has traditionally been a taboo subject but leaves many women with debilitating symptoms. Mariella says: \u201cI\u2019ve never made anything that has made such a brilliant, life-affirming reaction. \u201cTo make a programme that can really impact in a positive way on people\u2019s lives felt like such a gift.', '\u201cBut in another way it was rather horrifying, because everywhere I went there was another woman with a terrible story about what I would say was medical malpractice or talk about the sense of shame they\u2019d endured.\u201d', 'She says she wants to make menopause mainstream and feels that society\u2019s attitudes towards it \u201ccan\u2019t change soon enough\u201d.', '\u201cThe level of ignorance about female physiognomy is so mind-blowing, it makes me angry,\u201d she says. \u201cThe menopause has opened a Pandora\u2019s box for me of how deep the misogyny of the world runs.', '\u201cIt was only in 1993 that they mandated that women and minorities had to be included in medical tests.', '\u201cAnd in 1993 they definitely were aware of the fact that men and women have completely different cell structures, bodies, we react differently to influences, externally and internally.', '\u201cYet women have been completely left as a spare rib. We have only ever been investigated through a male prism. I really am sick of a kind of constant battle of the sexes \u2013 and I am really reluctant to add my voice to it or encourage it \u2013 but it\u2019s all about equality, and we all want to live in a fairer world.\u201d', 'The broadcaster and journalist declares: \u201cPeople are not interested in women\u2019s issues generally and women of my age specifically.', '\u201cThe worst thing about the menopause is the shame that it induces in women and the derision it invokes in wider society.\u201d Never shy of political debate, she fires up: \u201cWe need to talk more about the menopause. It\u2019s now becoming a burgeoning industry because there are loads of women starting female health-focused drug companies, so instead of ignoring 50 per cent of the population they are absolutely focused on them.', '\u201cI think great things are going to happen in the next couple of decades as a result.\u201d', 'Mariella, 56, has been open about having HRT for sleeplessness and anxiety.', 'Her exploration of her own menopausal journey and other women\u2019s experiences aired on the BBC late last year.', 'She feels exasperated with reports generating frightening headlines about HRT risks and with a crisis of supplies reportedly forcing some British women to fly abroad after warnings they could struggle to get hold of patches for nearly a year.', 'And while a report last week revived the long-running debate of whether HRT raises women\u2019s risk of breast cancer, she has no intention of throwing away her tablets just yet.', 'Mariella says: \u201cOf course that is what the headlines are for, to give you a frisson of alarm, but they don\u2019t print all the other stuff about how you have eight per cent chance of developing cancer if you drink too much and you have an eight per cent chance if you are obese.', '\u201cIf you don\u2019t breastfeed you have double the chance of developing cancer than if you take HRT.\u201d', 'She is now in talks with the BBC to make a sequel.', '\u201cThere was so much science we didn\u2019t get to cover,\u201d she says.', '\u201cFrom libido, which they were a bit nervous about doing in the first one, to the studies now about the link to Alzheimer\u2019s and menopause. Two-thirds more women than men get Alzheimer\u2019s and it\u2019s never been investigated.', '\u201cI feel we just scratched the surface in the first programme of something that is an enormous and continuing crime to womankind.\u201d', 'She is sanguine about ageing but adds: \u201cWhat I really don\u2019t enjoy is taking pills for this and pills for that.', '\u201cUp until the age of 44, apart from the Pill and an occasional course of antibiotics, I hadn\u2019t really taken any tablets.', '\u201cNow all of a sudden because I have a congenital heart condition \u2013 my father died young of heart disease and my grandfather \u2013 so I have to take statins for that, and then I\u2019ve got to take progesterone and oestrogen and I hate it! If I could have an ovary removed 20 years ago (to delay the menopause), I would have done it in a heartbeat.\u201d', 'The former music business PR (she promoted Live Aid), is well known for her husky tones and long-term friendship with George Clooney who her children \u2013 Molly, 15, and Danny, 14 \u2013 call Uncle George.', 'Yet she confesses that she too has a smartphone addiction and is prone to FOMO (fear of missing out).', '\u201cI don\u2019t want to be sitting in my bed at night looking at work emails or things on Instagram that make me feel my life is sad and tragic, or not exotic or wealthy enough \u2013 all the stupid things that those posts make you feel,\u201d she admits.', 'As well as hosting Radio 4\u2019s Open Book and the popular podcast Books To Live By, Mariella is also on the judging panel of Amazon\u2019s Kindle Storyteller Award.', 'She feels it is crucial to encourage storytelling and reading rather than poring over social media.', 'And she admits forcing her children to read a book this summer.', '\u201cOne each,\u201d she says.', '\u201cMuch to their chagrin. We need to make a case for reading but also time out off technology in order to improve all of our lives. It\u2019s a constant strug-gle with children but I am quite tenacious.', '\u201cI have three more years of influence and I consider it a moral responsibility to teach them that just because the smartphone is there, and you can use it 24/7, doesn\u2019t mean you have to.', '\u201cWhat kind of mum I am? Strict and bossy. Yeah. That\u2019s what my kids would say!\u201d', '* The Kindle Storyteller Award 2019 is a \u00a320,000 literary prize recognising newly published work in the English language across any genre. The prize was open to all authors who published their book through Kindle Direct Publishing on Amazon.co.uk between 1st May and 31st August 2019. The winner will be announced at a London award ceremony this October.",

I felt I could have slept on a washing line without waking up during that time... within a month of taking HRT I was a completely different person....and felt much better for it",
