I think that even the word <b> 'immigrant</b>' should not be used in these cases. Immigration is a legal procedure for crossing the border and becoming a member of the country. A country without borders is like a body without skin. Opening the border would be the end of our way of life. I, like so many more Americans, am a<b> n immigran</b>t. The moment I crossed the border at the airport, I felt like everybody else, despite my ridiculous English. It was a new and wonderful feeling.",

By the way it's all theatre, freemasonry runs both sides and is trying to have the country to collapse from within in order to become social<b> ist/ commu</b>nist under a global new UN like structure after the third WW now that they helped to build up a worthy enemy in the allies between China and Russia against NATO. Ever since they ridiculed Bill Clinton in front o<b> f the n</b>ation for an affair to bring down the office of president, ever since they forced in W.Bush to show the elections were corrupt, ever since they had Hillary come out with Obama not being an American born citizen to bring down the constitution and now purposely created the total divide and non acceptance of a democratic elected president #not my president. They're slowly breaking the US down from within on purpose. Globalism can't handle freedom of speech, gun rights etc. this is a long social engineering scam and fake opposition theatre and your all falling for it Just look into freemasonry presidents/ police/ military/ media/ music industry/ film industry/ banks/ religions/ NASA/ FBI/ CIA/ Fortune 500 companies or the fact that D.C. Is a private Freemason owned city state with Freemason border posts, the world council of freemasonry and a complete Freemason preplanned freemason symbolism layout whilst googling the Albert Pike Freemason Luciferian quote from his book reasons and dogma. It's all a divide and conquer theatre and you'll falling for it.",

There is a good reason Democrats are called \"demon(c)rats\" because of things that happened after the election. The evil that was unleashed was eye-opening, before that I thought that there are not so many evil groups within Dem supporters. Also the media, like this video, is not what it should be. Democrats, you are not doing and acting like your party name suggests. You are just bitter and harmful lot that makes the USA look bad.",

The so called 'squad' preaches anti-Semitic propaganda, supports ISIS, supports the attacks of ICE facilities on US soil, etc. Even Nancy Pelosi knows how <b> racist </b>they are, yet doesn't do anything about it because it doesn't support her anti-Trump narrative. AOC has no idea what she is doing, Omar is anti-Semitic, Pressley says that if you don't share her views you aren't really<b>  black</b> o<b> r g<b> a</b</b>>y (for those where her rhetoric is applicable). \n\nI admit, Trump is not the best communicator, and could use some work on how he delivers messages. But don't let that take away from what he is doing for you. Look at how the economy is doing. Look at your 401k, your 457, your IRA. Look at the record number of employed Americans. The economy is booming, and it's all because of our President. \n\nYou guys like the 'squad'? AOC's great New Green deal would cost Tax payers an additional $65,000 a year per tax payer on average... Gee that sounds smart. She and the rest of them want to open up our borders. Do you realize what that would do to our economy? The idiot governor of California just signed a 215 billion dollar tax budget which increased California's budget by $95 billion so that illegal immigrants can have free health care.... paid for by the California tax payers. \n\nThe democrats are ripping this country apart. All you non-Trump supporters need to pull your heads out of your asses. Stop focusing on his tweets, and start looking at the bigger picture.",

He was saying how he's a slave here...so I said, \"If it's so bad here why don't you go back then?\". It's a war torn country, and honestly - I think it's silly that we should be adopting values of a country that has major issues. Why would someone come here to escape the problems of one country, only to bring those values and problems to this country? Even if I, someone born here, was showing favoritism towards the country of my parents, I don't think it's actually <b> racist </b>for someone else to say \"Hey, if you like it there so much, why not move back to where you're originally from?\" It's a bit of a wake up call - We have SO much freedom here, and WAY more security (Yes even given ALL the shootings and bombings and everything). There are bomb barricades, vehicle inspections.... Why do we need to adopt values that there are Caste Systems, that some people are less because of who they were born to? Those sound like shitty ideals - no thanks. If you think the rate of immigration has NO effect, you are<b>  blind</b>. Ask yourself something: Should America accept EVERY application for immigration? What is the  rough number of ppl that should be allowed to immigrate? What is this number based on? Why isn't that number higher? Do you think it is possible for someone in government to show Bias towards countries that their parents come from? How? Conflicts of interest are not some new thing. I don't think these ar<b> e racis</b>t tweets - why would he say \"you're welcome to come back if you want.\" Why didn't he just say \"Get the hell out of our country?\" Seth is pretty funny, but I do believe he pushes Corporate Democratic views a lot.... Lol, look at his coverage on \"Andrew Yang\"( Democratic Presidential Primary Debate, Night Two - A Closer Look 13:27 - he showed Yang going \"huh\" to the question and THAT WAS IT. When it comes to Bernie, he's FINALLY lightening up. Go ahead, look  up Seth's Video \"Hey! A Message to Bernie or Bust Die-Hards\" - Where he pushes the ONE CANDIDATE IN AMERICA AT THE TIME LESS FAVORABLE THAN DONALD TRUMP  (YES, HILARY CLINTON).  Smart move bud! You're funny, but clearly have your own agenda. I'm calling it like it is. FAKE. NEWS.",

Congress absolutely can vote to impeach and that vote could well pass. We would then have an impeachment trial for 3-5 months at most. The vote would then go to the Senate and Mitch McConnell will vote it down because regardless of the findings of such a trial he will never go against Trump. We then have about a year or so of Trump saying at every campaign rally that he was found innocent. If we wasn't going to win before that, you know he'll convince enough schmucks after that to vote for him and four more years we go. Pelosi is right not to impeach him. Go after his credibility in the polls, get him voted out, and then the courts can go after him as a private citizen and McConnell and the like don't get a look in.",

                    "commentText": "@Tim Wilde first, bear in mind that an impeachment is a trial, the only trial that a sitting elected official can be indicted at. Very little is proven conclusively, but where there is enough evidence of possible wrongdoing, a trial is the only legal way to ascertain the truth. In this case, there is just too much evidence of possible criminality in the Trump Whitehouse to be ignored. \n\nFirst, the Mueller report may have not found evidence of direct collusion between Trump and the Russians, but it did show clear evidence that Trump may have personally obstructed justice in trying to end investigations into the administrations ties to Russia. The Report only stopped short of recommending prosecution because it wouldn't have been possible to do to a sitting president and Mueller felt it was beyond his remit to recommend a prosecution. Even so, over 450 former prosecutors from both sides of the aisle signed an open letter stating that if Trump were a private citizen and the case had been on their desks, they would have indicted him for obstruction based on the evidence in Mueller's report. That alone would be enough to at least impeach the president and have a court with real power over him ascertain the truth in this matter.\n\nThen you have the litany of other allegations of corruption. According to Trump's personal lawyer, Stormy Daniels was paid hush money from Trump's personal accounts and paid by that lawyer on orders from Trump himself, *during an election campaign*. This is an unequivocal violation of US campaign finance law if true. Trump has also refused to completely divest himself of his personal business interests, and in particular has continuously used his own hotels such as Mar A Lago and the Trump International Hotel DC for official state business, thus profiting hugely from all the meetings, hotel stays and use of facilities that foreign officials, lobbyists, etc have used while trying to get access to the President. This is most likely a horrendous conflict of interest in itself, and also leads to a huge amount of other possibilities in the realm of paying for access to an elected official. \n\nThen there's his horrendous personal behaviour that utterly brings the office of the Presidency into disrepute. He has made hugely <b> racist,</b> bigoted statements as president, of which the comments against the so-called Squad are only the most recent. He leads rallies that I would skirt the boundaries of Godwin's law to describe. He shuns other leaders of Western Democracy to cosy up to dictators and tyrants like Kim Jong Un, Erdogan, Putin and Crown Prince Salman Al Saud. \n\nOh and there are even allegations that he attended some of Epstein's parties back in the 90s, with one girl in particular saying she was chosen to be raped by Trump at 15 because she was wearing a blond wig and \"reminded him of his daughter\", which is particularly telling considering all of the seriously creepy stuff Trump has said on record about Ivanka.\n\nI have more, but YT comments have a character limit.\n\nAll of these are allegations.<b>  Nothing</b> is proven in court, but that's exactly what a fair impeachment trial would do. Unfortunately, such a trial would be impossible while the Senate Republicans led by Mitch McConnell refuse to act in good faith and instead hold to partisanship at all costs, which is why I suggested that instead, we wait until he leaves office and then indict him as a private citizen.",

The detention centers would not be inhumane were they not so horribly overwhelmed. Our border control personnel are excellent compassionate people doing the best they can under the circumstances. The illegals brought it upon themselves when they bum-rushed our border. They put themselves into a situation that exists now. Mexico used to do a much better job of stopping them at the southern end of their country until Trump started insulting them and their government, Add his rediculous wall into the equation and the actual wall that Mexico was providing simply faded from view, I don't blame them at all it is their way of letting Trump know to revise his thinking. Unfortunately, he does not have the intellectual acuity to see it. Even so, we cannot simply allow thousands of undocumented individuals to just aimlessly roam our streets. The quickest fix is to send military transports to take them back to their own countries, at least until we can upscale our facilities. We use to have Ellis Island on the east coast I guess we need something similar in Texas. I guess the \"Progressive\" types would have us put them all up in a Holiday Inn. All the Grandstanding in the world won't accomplish anything other than self-promotion, which those \"Progressive women are all experts at, of course, all politicians are guilty of the same thing or they would never have gotten into office in the first place.",

Concentration camps were perfected to kill 13M people in what was the Western country with the highest literacy rate at the time. For every \"third world\" example you quote, there is a \"western culture\" equivalent to be found via 5 minutes of Googling. Malala Yousafi was shot by a Pakistani fanatic, but Elizabeth Smart was abducted and sexually assaulted by a white western fanatic. And, for the record, I have lived, worked and studied in 5 different continents. I am not afraid of living in any geographic or cultural context. What makes me different from (and better that) Trump supporters is that I am adaptable, whereas those intellectually mediocre monolinguals are terrified of anything they are unfamiliar with. That is why they stay in Rust Belt towns, abusing opiates, complaining against \"third world people stealing their jobs\" instead of taking responsibility for their mediocrity.",

Money laundering had not yet been criminalised.  I have read that Drumpf family ran brothels, hence his reluctance to state how he earned it. However, he couldn't run brothels here (others were in control of that already) so as fate would have it, he invested his fortune in real estate and made a modest return. When Donald Trump inherited the business he over-invested with debts soaring beyond capacity and relied on secretiveness lest they divulge the near-bankrupt state the business had reached. I",

Don't be too quick to dismiss this, it's a cornerstone of his political platform of spreading hate and exclusion, using divide and conquer. Trump's way is the only way because he knows it all. And if you think he doesn't feel that way, just listen to him in any random interview. \nPeople tell you who they are, we've only to listen and believe them, and we've heard more than enough from Trump about Exactly Who He Is!!\nTHE EMPEROR IS WEARING NO CLOTHES!",

Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how....\n....it is done.

I have spent a lot of money here, and experienced your fantastic country and a lot of that awesomeness you project to the world.\nThere are still things I want to see, still things I want to do. But here's where it ends for me. Unless you make some serious changes towards civility, and towards global politics (we all live on the same planet, you know), I'm done with you.\nGood luck, USA.

President Trump has since tweeted that he has not got a <b> racist </b>bone in his body - and I will have to agree with him fully on his statement. As I see it,<b>  Racism</b> does not thrive or live in a persons bones or body, it thrives on a persons tongue and heart which Mr Trump has got - think about it. Make AMERICA GREAT AGAIN is that from a bone in his body? The rest of the world is watching and listening and we believe no one deserves this sort of treatment. Keep cool, many blessings and keep praying.",

This is just the Left, which I'm still ashamed to be a part of, making a mountain out of a mole hill. Trump is stupid, of course he's going to say stupid things. If you want him to stop, turn off your TV, stop reading his Tweets and vote him out of office. Twitter will ban him once he's not President, and you will go back to only knowing about him as that one guy who puts his name on buildings and fired people on TV. You have the power to change it, not with tweets, not with comment sections, but with votes. Stop bitching, and do everything you can to make sure you and those who agree with you vote. If you don't succeed, then it's apparent you don't have your thumb on the pulse of American society and the people within it. If more people want him as a President, that's Democracy.",

It was released in 1940, before the full horror of what Hitler had done was revealed to anyone Stateside\u2014Chaplin later said that he would never have made the film if he had known just how heinous Hitler's crimes had really been. The final monologue is quite brilliant, however, and still relevant today. For additional contemporary criticism, you should also check out the song \"Der Fuehrer's Face\" by the band <b> Spike </b>Jones and His City Slickers.\n\nIt's not that evil has become funny, so much as comedy has always been a way for people to cope with otherwise-depressing and tragic situations (\"gallows humor\", children's nursery rhymes that let you criticize politically powerful people a la Mother Goose and Dr. Seuss, satirical plays, etc.).",

You should look into the historical records and you'll find the democrats were always the racists and ever since<b>  black</b> people got the right to vote they just turned it all around pretending to be the no<b> n racis</b>t party in order to enslave t<b> he bla</b>ck population thru welfare and other measures to keep them bound to th<b> eir </b>old masters. By the way it's all theatre, freemasonry runs both sides and is trying to have the country to collapse from within in order to become social<b> ist/ commu</b>nist under a global new UN like structure after the third WW now that they helped to build up a worthy enemy in the allies between China and Russia against NATO. Ever since they ridiculed Bill Clinton in front o<b> f the n</b>ation for an affair to bring down the office of president, ever since they forced in W.Bush to show the elections were corrupt, ever since they had Hillary come out with Obama not being an American born citizen to bring down the constitution and now purposely created the total divide and non acceptance of a democratic elected president #not my president. They're slowly breaking the US down from within on purpose. Globalism can't handle freedom of speech, gun rights etc. this is a long social engineering scam and fake opposition theatre and your all falling for it Just look into freemasonry presidents/ police/ military/ media/ music industry/ film industry/ banks/ religions/ NASA/ FBI/ CIA/ Fortune 500 companies or the fact that D.C. Is a private Freemason owned city state with Freemason border posts, the world council of freemasonry and a complete Freemason preplanned freemason symbolism planned layout whilst googling the Albert Pike Freemason Luciferian quote from his book reasons and dogma. It's all divide and conquer theatre and you'll falling for it.",

A signficant number of the \"best\" people he chose have been terminated, have resigned or are in prison or facing serious charges. The US has been now proven as one of the worst countries in the world in its disregard of the respect of basic human rights, as according to the declaration of Human rights and the ONU.  And now a known <b> sex </b>offender has been proven to have been given a plushy plea deal by the now extinct secretary of Labor.  And now he goes on to attack 4 Americans citizens, who happen to be women, from the Democratic party, based on the tone of their skin.  He is on the attack, meaning on the defensive, using whatever mad scenario he can use to regain control.  Because that is the way it seems.  His<b>  racism</b> was always there, however spinned in controlled sentences.  But now , even this early in the game, which seems to me to be a big mistake on his part, he seems desperate enough to try to belittle those 4 women's achievements.  Seems to me trump is behaving like a cornered and pathetic candidate for his reelection.  I may be wrong, but I do not recall any presidential candidate ever having had to stoop so low that early in the game.  Just MHO.",

They change the laws, develop their own system, make themselves richer and richer and more and more powerful at the cost of all the others. Then more and more regular folks get poorer and poorer. And frustrated. And people who seem different become easy targets (religions, skin colour, ...) and easy to point the finger on. Refugees are not the problem, greed is.",

And Americans don't tend to change governments in the midst of war (1968 being an exception).  In all the other 6 out of 7 presidential elections, Democratic voters were in the MAJORITY.  But the minority Republicans took the White House in 2000 due to a biased Supreme Court decision; and in 2016 the ancient \"Electoral College\" gave the White House to Trump despite his opponent getting 3,000,000 more votes than he did.  \n\nThese FACTS demonstrate that the Democrats are clearly the MAJORITY party...... but Republicans have so bent and twisted our democratic processes in so many ways (gutting Voting Rights Acts; disenfranchising felons; stringent new voter registration policies; few and poor voting precincts in non-white neighborhoods; introducing huge amounts of corporate money into political campaigns; secret money \"Super PACs\"; gerrymandering; this list could go on and on...... ALL Republican ideas), that this corrupt MINORITY party still clings to power by its fingernails.  \n\nBut the voters will \"see clearly\" in 20-20.....  if we make it that far.  Beware the Republicans launching a war next year, to \"unify the country\" and distract from all their corruption.",

Omar's is so low (9%) that a statement had to be issued that the rating wasnt a typo. and this was done by Democrats' own internal polling, not some far right propaganda research. If Trump manages to make 'the squad'  the national face of the Democratic party going into the election he'll have another 4 years. anybody who isn't completely ideological can see how bad things are looking right now  for people who want him out. and no I didn't vote for him in 2016, I just am aware that facts matter more than how I 'feel' about a person in power. and FYI you keep making these identity politics statements thinking thats going to get anyone to listen to you or like you and you've got a difficult life ahead of you",

The Americas is a term used to describe the New World, also known as North, Central, and South America.\n\nAnd actually the Native Americans have been saying that for the last 1000 years. In the East of Canada a Norse settlement was found and it dates back to 900-1000 years ago. Basically the Vikings were the first Europeans to reach North America, not the Spanish or the French. The settlement is called L'Anse Aux Meadows. \n\nAnd Christopher Columbus was probably the second to reach the Americas He went to Central America, and soon a few other Spanish colonizers came to Central America and South America where they ruthlessly killed the Aztecs and the Mayans.\n\nThird to reach the Americas was Jacques Cartier who was said to have been greeted by the Native Americans when they saw him sailing. The Native Americans were said to have been waving at Jacques Cartier large ship, which is something to think about, because why would they be waving??? What if these Native Americans were waving because they had met and traded with other Europeans, but what if those Europeans were actually the first to reach the Americas but they never made it back to Europe?\n\nIt's the only explanation to why the Native Americans (in modern day Canada) were waving at a French ship! If they were waving it means they must've already met other Europeans. \n\nHistory will never be accurate.",

                    "commentText": "@Lucifer Augustus Thank you for that thought provoking, Intelligent Comment. \nWhy do good, sensible people like yourself eschew American politics,  when you and others like you - Dem. Rep. Or Other - Could and Would Make the States United.\nI'm not American, but it's only good sense to keep abreast of US politics (as well as E.U. Du.K [Disunity Kingdom]  and Russian, Chinese, Asia & Japan !] \nBut I've always thought there are 2 Immediate needs in U.S. Politics. \n1) A Limited Amount of Money EVERY PERSON Running for a <b> Senior </b>Political position - from State Level Right Through to Presidential election. \n2) More Political Parties. A 2 Party System Changes Virtually<b>  nothing</b>. \nA \"Third Way\" Party could have its Best ever chance in this current, deeply fragmented Political Climate that may, God Forbid, continue for the next 12 years !  So many people \"Feel\" Dissatisfied Disappointed, Unheard & Disenfranchised, that the Next President will be Most likely to be Elected by less than 50% of folks Eligible to Vote ! \nAnd the Current Crop are to busy 'In-fighting' to See that Voter Registration Reform will have Offices open from 10am - 12pm, then 2pm - 4pm Mon - Fri.\nYou will need 4 - 5 pieces of Identity, 2 which must be Photographic & Less than 2 year<b> s Ol</b>d. Bank & Utilities with your Name & Address Must be Older than 4/5 years ! And who has All That ? Not even most Lower Middle Class bracket folks keep or Have that much Proof of Identity. When we decided Peace was maybe a little bit more Intelligent a route to go here in North Ireland,  A valid Long-form Birth Certificate, 2 Utilities/Bank Statements and 2 Photo ID's were the initial requirement - and Irish Passports were only accepted After a \"Turn the  Table over & Feck Yous! You'll get an All Out Civil War,  and Feck the Consequences you'll bring down on Innocent People's Heads !\" \nAll over a Passport - A Valid & Accepted I.D. document in Most Civil countries ! \n* This was a Personal Anecdote from a close cousin & friend of my OH, who was in a High enough Position to be Inside the Peace Talks, as they happened ! And kept Family aware of what could suddenly happen, in case Families wanted to be prepared, beforehand, to make Plans to move - into the Republic of Ireland, to Scotland or England, or further afield to Europe, Australia, New Zealand (Where Every Irish person, of whatever Creed, has Relatives!) Or, of course, the US of A !\nWhen recently at a Family Occasion, not happy, but typically Irish, I was in a group discussion of Trump and what he's doing to America and a quick Poll went around the Room. A rough 75% were RoI, E.U. Australia & New Zealand. HOME in N.Ire. Canada: 12-14%. Shockingly: Dubai, U.A.E. was 5%. With, because of Family, 5-8% the U.S.A. \nWith 1 Wit announcing, He Wouldn't Immigrate to America, because they're too busy handling the new Applications from Latin America. His Information, which I checked before this, was there were up to 30 times more people trying to Legally Enter,  and the Next Largest Group (having the Least Trouble !) Were Former Soviet Citizens, who were trying to Enter through Canada ! \nThere were also significant numbers coming from the East Russia Region, into Alaska and easily being grant<b> ed Immigra</b>nt Status - as long as They stayed (I think it was) 5-6 years - but this didn't apply to Minors at their Initial Entry. \nI know, from having spent time interacting with them in a Charity and spending time in Belarus schools assessing Children for our Program, that these kids made Irish kids, North & South, look like they were being Educated by a Robot on \"Rote Mode, Answer No questions Not on the Curriculum !\" \nBut these Belarusian kids in the far South East,  Where the Chernobyl Nuclear Cloud had passed over, and the Russian Fire- Fighting Planes had dropped 100's of 1000s of Litres of Water, while the \"Weather\" Planes had dropped Silver Iodide and, essentially Salt, in a Huge \"Cloud Seeding\" operation to disperse as much Radiation from the \"Cloud\" down on to and into the trees, vegetation, crops and soil of Belarus - one of the \"Bread Basket\" of <b> the </b>Old USSR - Up Until The 26th April 1986, when in a bid to save major Cities in Russia from being contaminated with <b> the \"B</b>lack  Rain\" ! Which fell for several days covering up to 4000sq miles of Belarusian soil and turning  the Belarusian Bread Basket<b>  into no</b>thing anyone wanted to eat - not   even people on the Street people !!\nAnyway,  I digress - a well known habit of mine, - and wish you Luck, Peace, Health and Happiness 2U and Yours!\n\ud83d\udc4d\u2618PoD\u2618\u270c\ud83d\udd96",

I agree democracy is threatened. \nRather than screaming, which I feel like doing daily, I am passionately working to eliminate the electoral college. At this time, all we have to fight with is voting. No, it's not as effective as I'd wish, but it beats crying. \nMy fear is using the outdated & broken electoral college as an excuse for apathy reduces voter turnout, further emboldens Fascist regimes.

Many will agree the comments were unneeded and divisive, but at this point many have made up their mind on Trump. Many are burnt out by the scandals and the 'Orange Man Bad' narrative on Late night shows and MSM shows that even something like this won't register for some. The message has become saturated for some and may even recoil just to spite all the establishment and media coverage that are supposedly against Trump.\n\nMeanwhile a major policy that is cutting off Asylum for Central Americans (A LEGAL RIGHT) and the bombing of a Border Facility in Colorado BARELY gets a blip from anyone. Media has gone from reporting of a story and letting us decide what to think about it to telling us what to think about each story. I personally hope that people will just let this go and actually put resources to fighting these problems instead, cuz at this point it's about fighting Trump with policies, not talking on Twitter and grandstanding which is what Trump wants! \n\nTrump wants people focused on his Tweets to get attention away from his damaging policies he is enacting! He won't care about what words to do it, he just cares about getting it done. He knows media coverage would have been bad anyway, so let's throw comments against people that Republicans and even some Moderates dislike as a smokescreen.\n\nMedia will never get it. It was never about his ridiculous and divisive tweet; the tweet was a block of cheese for the mice to chase while the Donald got his stuff done. If you truly want to spite Trump, stop paying attention to his tweets and caring about what he says. Attention is what creates the narrative he wants, but if you keep you head away and focus on actual solutions to make Americans feel like their lives are getting better, that will be what wins your election in 2020.",

Right wing media comes out saying what you just said, squak squak goes the parrots repeating it. FYI: Telling someone to go back to the country \"where they are from\", describing that country for them to go back to as a place other than the USA\u00a0when the women being addressed are all\u00a0US citizens, is<b>  racist</b>. He is saying that those people don't have the right to criticize how the US government is being run because of their non US heritage. And if you don't believe me then look up all the support the President is getting from white supremacists who are loudly cheering and repeating this sentiment to all the minorities.",

Well they might have been quiet for a number of decades but, They're Back!! Not only are they back but now one of them is in the oval office. But this guy has motives well beyond just defending his abominable words and actions, he wants to silence all dissidents. This is just him on the path he's laid out for himself of being president until he decides he doesn't want to be anymore. Just think how much better we'd be today if Germany had executed his grandfather instead of exiling him to America. Hmm, maybe that's where he got the idea that Mexico was sending us all the people they didn't want.",

How so? The racial wealth gap and massincarciration plus many facets of ADOS. I love all people especially white people most of my friends are white in no<b> t racis</b>t I've even dated only white a<b> nd bla</b>ck men, but I don't agree with open boarders that don't protect ADOS life . How so? Being ADOS I fill imigrants come and are used extention to  oppress US in our own land through redlining, over policing, education, and  health . These tactics are used to steal and keep ADOS and poor people down, so not j<b> ust rac</b>ist feel that something is wrong with this governme<b> nt . B</b>lack ADOS people are sayi<b> ng no </b>black agenda no vote \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 imigrants will say I don't owe repera<b> tions, </b>racist whites, so called liberals and the 1% that benefits the most off of the blood sweat and tears of ADOS will oppose reperations too . America owes a debt and hell bent on oppressing US beca<b> use ou</b>r black bodies is capital to them . I'm always confused on why Americans are ok with imprisoning US when education and reform of the ghettos it created are cheaper for tax payers? Why would any citizen agree to pay 200k annually to house a kid in prison ? Or a adult 100k annually ? That's insane. But I understand why our bodies are criminalized and capitalized on my God the pris on industrial system the justice system exist because of slavery do this extention needs to be reformed plus reperations so that the people that built the country can live the American dream and truly be human in this country .",

If the Government were \"perfect\", we would not pay 535 members at least $170,000 per year to pass laws to make it better.  At least that's the idea, in theory!!!\n\n\n    Of course, it's strange that even though the President did not mention any names of Congresspersons, everyone seems to think he was referring to AOC, Pressley, Tlaib, and Omar!",

It's still early stages but the traction is picking up. \n\n\nHe's been nominated to Justice Democrats, and I could totally see them, including their incumbents in Congress, rallying up around him. Given the high profile they have now, and Buttar running against Pelosi in freaking San Francisco, if they bring the attention to that <b> race </b>there's quite a chance he does take the seat. I don't know who would become the Speaker in that case.",

Underage girls and pedophilia are not the same thing. A 15 years <b> old </b>post puberty girl is underage, but strictly speaking she has lost the features of a prepubescent child, which is what pedophiles are attracted to. Aside from that one, and I'm being generous specifying the actual psychology here, because I'm not sure the legal distinction is as generous, all the other ones are factual. Oh wait, maybe the Hitler one, but that's because Hitler was less<b>  dumb</b>. Neo-Nazis certainly seem to love Trump so it's not quite far off though. \n\n\nAs to why is he still there? A combination of factors, one, you assume Americans don't like those qualities, but that's what the Republicans stand for. So bein<b> g homophobi</b>c, sexist, incompetent, corrupt, adulterer, tax evader, transphobic, anti semiti<b> c, raci</b>st, etc aren't cons, they're pros. That's what they like. The other factor is heavy gerrymandering and vote suppression (and as we found out straight up vote fraud), allowing a Congress that has received more votes for Democrats but is dominated by Republicans, which since that's what their party stands for, they will enable this. Same reason why he won the presidency but 3 million more Americans voted for the other candidate. Also, the majority of Americans do believe these things, because they know they're true. Over 50%, and sometimes well over 50% agree on most of these. The Republican core would excuse anything even in the face of blatant evidence for it because they're fully into a cult now.",

Every pro GOP/Trump comment I read was about kicking people out of the country or forcing Trump on us in 2020 or death threats or something else horrendous.\n\n\nYou must remember that you not only have to engage in politics to protect your own interest ,but the interest of the country. And with Trump people seem to not care about either. Just hurting people who disagree with you.\n\n\n\nThe reason you want him to be president so badly is to create chaos not to reunite this country and do what is best for its people.\nI pray that is country or world hasn't gone past the point of no return.",

So change the narrative like he has done time and time again. It's one of the base tools in any conman's toolbox.

I think this will do more lasting damage than Richard Nixon's surreptitious burglaries did.\"\nThat's George Will, folks. Not Rachel Maddow. And it's George Will saying that what Trump is doing, has done and will do to -- and with -- the presidency is more destructive than the actions of a president who was forced to resign in order to keep from being impeached.",

His job is to preserve protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, to uphold and to enforce federal law - not to violate it.\"\n\n\"If he had ordered his aides to violate federal law to save a human life or preserve human freedom, he would at least have a moral defense to his behavior. But ordering them to break federal law to save himself from the consequences of his own behavior, that is immoral, that is criminally unlawful, that is defenseless, and that is condemnable.\"\n\nWatch \"Fox News judge gives Trump terrible news amid Mueller speech\" on YouTube\n\n [LINK] ",

This is the real story here. We are witnessing blowback from an unchecked and unhindered growth of this insanity until it becomes stifling and Fascistic in its own right. The left is so blinded by their hatred of Trump they can't see the brilliance of his move. He sees a weakness in the Democrat party and he is going in for the kill. He has put Nancy Pelosi into a position where she has to defend the very faction she hates thereby making it stronger and more of a problem for Democrat unity. People are missing the main show here; the Democrat Party is disintegrating and Trump is helping to fuel its demise. I'm sad to see it happen because Ideally, you need two strong parties to maintain a balance and keep both sides sharp hoping that the best ideas can rise to the top.",

They didn't pass up the chance to plug Kamala Harris, the current corporate democrat favorite in the<b>  race</b>. Everyone is talking about this, how is her opinion the most relevant?\n\nAgain, Seth is right about the main point and he's a great comedian and host, but you can see the little biases and nuances of network TV executives and producers in the back molding viewer awareness and thought.",

None of this is new news about Trump but the 41% who blindly follow him and eat up any of his lies just chose to ignore it. Seth Meyers really does well explaining how there are soooo many scandals that were becoming numb to it. He points out that at this point trump could mow the front lawn fully naked screaming \"I'm breaking every law there is!\" At the top of his lungs and the next week we'd be like \"oh right... That happened...\" Its a disgrace yet his base will defend it all... Nixon actually did the same thing with the Watergate scandal he bought and controlled news stories (something Trump was also caught doing more than once in his past and present) and released bits and pieces at a time as with other scandals to distract and deflect it was easier for a confused unfocused public to swallow and forget about that pill  that way...eventually though he even had the sense to resign before his V.P. couldn't pardon him anymore....",

I don't even think about making a holiday trip to the USA for as long as this catastrophe is in the White House.\n\nBTW: Know your place? TF are you to tell me where my place is.

Self-confidence (a strong sense of self) is different from narcissistic personality disorder; people with NPD typically value themselves over others to the extent that they openly disregard the feelings and wishes of others, and expect to be treated as superior, regardless of their actual status or achievements. Moreover, the person with narcissistic personality disorder usually exhibits a fragile ego (self-concept), intolerance of criticism, and a tendency to belittle others in order to validate their own superiority. - Wikipedia",

But I have to admit that he is right on this case. All those that you, Americans, call \"libtards\" spend their time blaming and complaining without finding solutions to the problems. If you want to find a solution to immigration in the US, yes maybe you should do something to the people that there are already living in the country illegally, but also you should do something to solve the problem in the place of origin of it. These group of stupid Democrats are not only \"making Trump great again\",but also they are the reason why Joe Biden is the only one to be the leader that the Democrats need to get Trump out of power.\n\nThese four sluts are way so damn stupid than even the sum of all of them would be equivalent to the intelligence an average preschool kid.\n\n For the sake of America and the world don't let neither Donald Trump nor these <b> Communist </b>whores to come in power.\n\nDictators around the world such as Putin or Xi Jinping may be laughing at you after watching this  stupid political theatre.",

Question Carole Roy:\u00a0Did you say the same for the Tea Party people that non-stop criticized the country for the 8 years before Trump? Do you say the same for the MAGA people who clearly thought America at some point is not great and need to be MADE great again? Its right there in the slogan...MAKE America great AGAIN. As in, its not great and we need to fix it. Literally the exact same thing these four women are\u00a0doing: Saying America is not great and needs to change to be made great again. How do you rationalize the hypocrisy of this?",

            "commentText": "It's funny: for people like Trump and movements like MAGA, their intrinsic position that America is fundamentally broken and must be fixed, is framed as a form of \"love\"; yet when their ideological \"enemies\" do the same because they see the freedoms and values of their society going down the drain, it's framed as \"hate\". So what's the difference? Isn't that hypocrisy?\n\nI guess the difference is that when Trump demands that America be great again, it's an Orwellian double-think. Within that single slogan, America is simultaneously broken and complete; it's wrong but also right; it's weakened but unassailable; it must change yet it's already perfect.\n\nYou see, when they chant \"Make America Great Again\", they aren't really talking about America as a country. They're using the term as a synonym for the people and the culture as they define them. Thus, the enemy are the people, ideas and stories which they believe do not belong. To the  MAGA movement, the problem with \"America\" is that it is no longer just \"them\". The <b> nation </b>has followed its logical ideological path and become so much more. Yet in the eyes of MAGA, America is being destroyed by that which does not belong. But most importantly, America is being destroyed by those people who are not them. That's how the double-think is be self-rationalised.\n\nYet from the other point of view -- the \"enemy\" -- there is no desire to remove Trump and his supporters from the country or exile them from society. Regardless of their actions today, they are an integral part of a functioning democracy. The other side wants to reason with them and come to a consensus -- to collectively agree upon a reality which is acceptable for the whole<b>  nation</b>, not just by one angry and spiteful minority and it's megalomaniacal leader.\n\nThat's love, actually. No pun intended. That's love for one's country and culture, and its people and their stories. Hatred, on the other hand, is to purposely lead a people towards cultural oblivion because the fear and the spite are so blinding that the very things the people profess to love are trampled and destroyed.",

It gets both bases fired up and keeps them hating each other, so no one is incentivized to fix the root cause of the problem, which is...drum roll please...our totally lax punishment for companies/people hiring illegals.

You may want that to be true, you may pass it off to other people as being true, you may hear that from other people as being true. But you're only hearing that from leftist because all of you live in a fantasy world. How exactly please tell me, how exactly is Trump in Putin's lap? Considering that we just had an investigation that lasted over two years and came back and said there's no proof of Russian collusion by Trump and his team. Did you miss that part did that get over your head?",

THAT is why we have firemen,   teachers paid a decent salary,  2-4 week paid holidays per year,  paid maternity leave,  good roads,  etc. etc. etc.   What do you have right now???   Until you learn and educate yourself - millions of people,  just as ignorant as yourself - will be doomed to failure!

I read and follow widely,  from far right to far left and everywhere in between - in several languages.  Moreover, I read the loathsome lump's  ghost-written autobiography. This is where my antipathy to who he is originated. \n\nMy comments in this regard far precede the election and any sniff of a Mueller investigation - his own utterances and those of the geljockey sons pointed clearly to the extent to which they were beholden to Russia.  \n\nWhere  is there a single occasion of him criticising the Russians? Where  was a single calling out of Russian expansionist aspirations and Neo-Soviet dreams? Is there anyone other than the brainwashed puppets that did not see they puppy dog on a leash that was on display in Finland? NATO, Canada, The UK, Germany et al get a ribbing, but  Putin and KJN get passes based on their mere say-so. \n\nOne thing i will say - he knows his game and he plays his pawns brilliantly. His comment about shooting someone in Fifth Avenue and still hanging onto his supporters is spot-on, for he could rob an <b> old </b>granny, hack a panda to death and ban ice cream, all in plain sight, and the bleating flock of apologists would STILL find a way to talk around it.",

If you are a person of color who is prejudice (based on the definition above) to a white person...

People being all pent up over this stuff is exactly what Trump wants. While the left gets into an outrage fit, Trump is laughing about doing actual harm/crime. Since 3 of the 4 offended people don't fit his description, why give it air? It doesn't apply to them, and best ignore it and go back to actual governing.",

So effectively using populism to his advantage. He wasn't a politician so people wanting change voted for him. Also, Clinton's campaign was boring and she couldn't get people rallied up the same way the showman Trump did. A lot of the democrats who wanted change in the goverment didn't even like her and see her as someone who could make changes.\n\n\nAnd then Trump of course had the help of Russian trolls and the electoral college.",

To call this<b>  racism</b> is an insult to every man<b> , woma</b>n, and child who have been the victims <b> of raci</b>sm. To somehow put this in the same category as a family having to watch their husband/father hung or, beaten, or set on fire due to the color of his skin is one of the most insulting things I have ever heard. It amazes me that in these instances people who have lived w<b> ith rac</b>ism their whole lives let lies like this be told. It is a travesty that four somewhat spoiled young ladies will face a situation like this and somehow feel they have end<b> ured ra</b>cism. It is a travesty that someone is convinced th<b> is is r</b>acism. It is a travesty that someone will read this tweet and now think they kno<b> w what </b>racism is. All that does is cause a person who is one day told by another that they have been the vi<b> ctim of</b> racism to not really understand the extent of what they have been through. To believe this is the type <b> of thin</b>g racism is is to rea<b> lly thi</b>nk racism isn't all that bad and not understand the true pain it brought. In other words, someone shares they have been the<b>  victim</b> of racism and the thought comes to mind, 'Oh, like those four women who were insulted by the president?' The tweet was wrong. It was appalling even, but if these women think t<b> hat thi</b>s is racism, they have no clu<b> e as to</b> what racism really is and should be educated before they speak. This is just my opinion but I doubt any of these young women have exp<b> erience</b>d true racism. It is and ugly, ugly thing but it is not having someone tweet something about you that hurts your feelings. It is an insult to the many men, women and children in graves due to the color of their skin. The 'squad' and Seth have just shown us all they <b> know les</b>s than not<b> hing ab</b>out what racism is. If they ever learn I hope it's not through experience like so many other beautiful, innocent people have learned. Please stop insulting them.",

The funny thing is Trump hasn't contributed to border security or jobs nearly as much as Fox told you to blindly believe. I mean, research isn't hard, it's what you learned in school, but I keep forgetting that research is actually easy, people like you just want to keep lying instead. Now, I haven't heard of Dems wanting \"open boards\" or \"free money to illegals\", and both statements are 100% lies. Why is that?",

The entire society is very controlling.... the DDR 'perfected' it, but West Germany was just as bad, the society was the same.  The difference was, at least the people of the former DDR are much more welcoming and nice.  Anyway, I can think of so many examples of the fascism.... I will never forget the day they came to my door to demand how many TV's I own, to pay the 'TV tax'... I told them to go away and eat my feces, it's none of their business how many TV's I own.  You couldn't even get a model airplane, with accurate markings from WW2, because certain symbols are 'verboten', totally missing the irony that restricting rights of expression is exactly what fascism was.  And then their entire manner was rude... For example, I will never forget how, upon waiting for meat at a deli, they would constantly simply walk in and cut in front of me, as if it was to be expected...  whenever I dated a <b> woman,</b> she would quickly launch into speeches on how evil the US is and how horrible the American food is\u2014 I will never forget, the parents of the<b>  woman</b> I was dating did exactly that, just as I was sitting down to eat their dinner!  I told them to f themselves, they should have known better than to behave so rudely with me as a guest there.  So many examples like that.  Very rude, fascistic society, it hasn't changed at all.  My father killed many Germans in 1944-1945 and he doesn't regret it.",

And even then his brain just makes up his own interpretation.   Which is 'bing, bing, bong'.  Then some shortcut circuit between his brain and his attached mouth muscles makes him spew out a lot of erroneous and disturbing disinformation or nonsense.\nThis sad president is not a human.  He his a philosophical zombie with a human physiology.  Not much of a soul in his material entity.  It must be put into law that the most powerful man (or <b> woman)</b> in the world must have a soul.  And that the intelligence quote at least is a bit higher then a seagull's.

But, it's interesting that you're sharing your own college experience, but that's not always the case, for everyone, in EVERY institution.  I'll give you an example\u2014 in an Aviation class I took, which had <b> nothing </b>to do with politics, in fact it was teaching the basics of Aviation Electronics, preparing future pilots, aircraft electricians and maintainers or aerospace<b>  engineers</b> to repair aircraft, as part of a program that awards a Federal FAA certification (in other words, of such import that learning or not learning the material might cost you not only your own life, but the 300 or 400 lives of the passengers on the aircraft), the instructor started every class in 2017 with a lecture on how evil Trump was, and how evil Republicans are, an<b> d h</b>o Republicans are insane... and of course I and no one else spoke up, because doing so would antagonize the instructor, which could result in our grades suffering in this all-important and very expensive class.  This happened for several weeks, until i finally had enough and called the Feds (the FAA) to report her, because I did not want to identify myself by complaining to the dean, who might agree with her.  They took it seriously and she almost lost her FAA certification.  That's just one example, from a NON Humanities course\u2014- I could go into Humanities courses as well, which were quite similar.  So, please don't be naive about this.",

It isn't reflective of 'character'.  'Character', in my book, has to do with integrity (i.e. does the person tell the truth), courage, trustworthiness, physical courage as well as moral courage, etc.  I've known plenty of people who are racists who are very good people, just as I have known egalitarians who are good people.  I judge 'character' as the measure of how likely you'd be to allow someone to babysit your child.  We need to get away from personal opinions on<b>  race</b> as being thought of as indicative of 'character'.",

However, in my college experience it wasn't the norm and I have 3 degrees and have taken many additional courses for job related training and personal interests.  BTW, my degrees, have <b> nothing </b>to do with matters that involve public health and safety and my first degree   was 22 years ago, things are different today.   ( I just googled the legality of teachers sharing  political views...paraphrased below)  \n\n\nApparently, many states forbid teachers to espouse their political views, and require teachers to remain politically neutral. \n\n\nIn fact, some of these laws have been upheld in places such as San Diego!  On a personal note,  I have taken several online classes over the past two years and have not recently experienced  a single incident where a professor shared their viewpoint.  But as you know it still surely happens, and in your case, I would have called the FAA as well, because that teacher was definitely being reckless.   \n\n\nYou may agree or disagree, but I will throw another topic into the mix, because I think its relative.  I am strongly against teachers, expressing their personal viewpoints about religion in class. In my state it is NOT illegal. But I will take the matter to court if I have to, I do not want my children learning anything about religion in school, unless they are taught about all religions/ matters of faith or the lack thereof such as atheism. In one view is discussed then all views need equal time to be equally discussed, and just the facts, not opinions.  I only want my kids to learn about religion at home or in church.",

Trump is creating jobs and lowering unemployment to get America back on its feet and he's the worst lmao might want to look at past presidents again. This is the first that a pres has negotiated with overseas corporations to bring jobs back. Even tho Obama said it couldn't be done and trump must have a magic wand. I wonder if that's what pissed everyone off the most lol I gotta admit bill Clinton got some strange in the Oval office was cool lol but that's about it.

You should refrain from making assertions until you do so at https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5955118-The-Mueller-Report.html. Mueller identified numerous incidents of conspiracy by multiple members of Trump's campaign and Trump associates but he decided that he could not prove CRIMINAL conspiracy (and did mention several times about being stymied in the investigation by lies and refusals to be interviewed). In volume two, the report listed about ten actions (or series of actions) that were deemed to be obstructive but, because of DOJ policy that prohibits indicating a sitting president, he could not even consider a conclusion on the question of criminal obstruction of justice by Trump. However, Mueller did write that \"if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.\" And \"while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\" In other words, Trump is not innocent of obstruction of justice charges. It is left, according to Mueller, to Congress to way the evidence and come to a conclusion.",

It says possible poll data sharing not that it actually happened. Then it goes on to state no collusion was made by the trump campaign even tho several attempts were made by Russians to Trump's campaign.  Then it gets really stupid and says he can't prove obstruction lol well hell no you can't prove obstruction without charging a crime. Pretty easy for anyone to figure out. What's strange is a prosecutor stated he can't charge yet can't exonerate lmao first damn prosecutor on earth to ever try to exonerate lmao that's for a judge and jury to decide. Not even Congress can jail someone without due process. Most worthless 400+ pages I've ever seen. I'm surprised you all aren't bitching about the investigation on how it started and all of the corruption leading to the Russian collusion hoax investigation.",

And working in 7 countries is a start... by the time I was 17, I had already lived in 19 countries... while I was in the military, probably 40, including those that I was in briefly.  Possibly more, if sit down and list them.  I'm sure you learned a lot in your 7 countries though...  I can remember a few years ago when I spent 3 tours in Iraq, each in a different area of Iraq... and long before that did 2 tours in Afghanistan.... and in between, numerous military exercises which entailed coordination and co-commands with the armed forces of approximately 10 different nations at once...  but I'm sure your work experience is comparable to that :)",

I would also like to thank you for voicing your opinions on this\u00a0section and\u00a0giving us\u00a0something to\u00a0debate. Finally I wish to apologies for the rude treatment that you've been subjected to by\u00a0mrcluein, Susan B, and Stealth Attack. They don't seem to understand that yelling insults\u00a0at people doesn't\u00a0help anyone, and rather makes them dig in their heals rather then opening a line of communication so that we can debate those we disagree with, and possibly change minds or at least come to an understanding with.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, please allow me to retort a few points you made. Particularly\u00a0you Craig Smith.\n\nI agree that were not now\u00a0under a dictatorship, however many of us on the left do fear that we're heading towards a more dictatorial form of government becoming the norm. It's our belief, and it's something that I feel as if the Republicans seem to have lost since Trump\u00a0took office, that\u00a0it's the duty of the voting\u00a0citizen\u00a0to check the power of our leaders, by calling out their pros and cons, discussing those pros and cons, and then voting on whether we as a collective society believe that their pros are better\u00a0then\u00a0their\u00a0challengers, or if their cons are just\u00a0to much for\u00a0us to put up with. The\u00a0Republicans used to call out Obama for\u00a0his flaws, and in many cases you\u00a0where right. \n\nBut Trump\u00a0is constantly testing our democracy. He's shown himself to be either inept, like the time he destroyed\u00a0everyone on\u00a0seal team five's careers, and put them,their families,\u00a0and their missions\u00a0in danger by posting a picture of them on twitter. Or he's malicious like how he\u00a0even after they where proven not guilty, he\u00a0still called for the continued imprisonment of the central park five. From what I've seen I believe it's a bit of both.\n\nNext, you did say that the Republican party freed the\u00a0slaves and gave <b> woman </b>their\u00a0rights. This is only half true and in a flimsy way at that.\u00a0Lincoln did free most of the slaves, and both the left and right celebrate him for that to this day. However It was democrats under\u00a0Woodrow Wilson who had power when women\u00a0started to\u00a0receive their rights. Also I think it's clear that the left and right switched places on many of the civil rights arguments since the civil rights act passed and the Republicans enacted the southern strategy. \n\nThe<b>  old</b>\u00a0Democrats where\u00a0responsible for\u00a0doing horrible things,\u00a0like th<b> e India</b>n removal act\u00a0put into place by former\u00a0Democratic\u00a0party leader and president of the US,\u00a0Andrew Jackson.\u00a0That lead to one of the worse acts of genocide that the western hemisphere had ever seen.\u00a0(that's\u00a0the person that Trump decided was worthy of putting his picture up\u00a0in the oval office to be a source of inspiration. So I don't think the argument that the Democrats of today are anything like the democrats of those times, or that the Republicans of today are anything like the Republicans that started the party holds much water.\n\nSorry for the long post (I kinda love history)\u00a0but if anyone has anything to say to farther this conversation I would be happy to listen.",

Andrew Jackson was long, long before the Civil War, and indeed had little to do with the Civil War, or with either party during the Civil War.  There were probably Republicans who idolized Andrew Jackson during the Civil War (because Jackson was very much anti-nullification, in fact he HATED John C Calhoun, who was a darling of the South and was the harbinger of the Confederacy, you might say).  In other words, Andrew Jackson, Democrat, was a hero of the Republicans of the Civil War\u2014 he and Lincoln had a lot in <b> common.</b>  Anyway, I don't really see how you can defend the statement that Republicans of the Civil War are 'not anything like' Republicans of today.  I do see a lot of the same racialism in today's Democrat party as existed in the Democrats of the 1850s, but that's another topic.",

It was all reps yay and all dems nay. I will look at the book again later and tell u the date and the votes counted on both bills. But same as today if it betters the American people and is good for the economy the reps vote yes and the dems vote no. Like the border funding aid bill. You still saying they switched lol. Why would the dems vote no on a bill that helps illegal immigrants ? Because it doesn't benefit them in any way. I know what I've read is accurate the author is the Senate magistrate book keepers Union. So the votes are accurate yet u try to refute. I'm wondering why. You don't like your parties past?

It was an insult to us Natives who watched Trump acknowledge our code talkers directly in view of Andrew Jackson's portrait. Jackson had had the opportunity to uphold the ruling that would have avoided one of the most devastating events for the Native American populace. Instead, he said that if no one would enforce the Supreme Court ruling to protect the Native Land then the ruling was moot. If you Trumpites needed further proof that party ideology has changed, Jackson was a Democrat at the time.",

That's the thing about us Americans, we have all kinds of people as our ancestors, and we love our military heroes.

Your mindset is EXACTLY why you never served\u2014 your will was not strong enough to overcome your limitations.  If you don't even have the instincts and drive to serve in the military no matter what, then you certainly don't have the killer instincts to be a Marine.

Vietnam wasn't my war, and it certainly wasn't yours.  So don't try to use it as an excuse for why you yourself were too cowardly to serve.  'Waaah I had asthma'.  Cry me a river.  I had much worse and I served.  And on top of that, after I was badly injured in Iraq (to the point that I needed massive surgery, and an entire year of physical rehabilitation to recover), on top of that, I was accepted to, joined and served in civilian law enforcement in a large city\u2014 I built myself back up until I could run and fight just as I could years before.

A person who behaves in an autocratic way;- he obstructs justice, ignores subpoena's , refuses to be interviewed, calls news reporters the enemy of the people, and that what these reporters say, is fake news!   A ruler with no checks and balances - Trump had no check or balance, when the Republican's held the congress and the white house - and appointed people to his cabinets that were not this president has no military experience - was given 5 deferments for the Vietnam War - he's a coward - and want's to spend millions to massage his ego!  Trump said he would rule for years, if he could!  He wants to be like the leader of China~  If this doesn't scare every American, you truly are delusional and should take a hard look at yourselves - it's bizarre behavior, and we the American People should not allow this to happen~",

He knew that the judge, who was clearly not on his side, would have a clear bias against Trump because Trump is building a wall between here and Mexico. Y'all made it seem like he didn't like him, he just didn't want the Judge's probable hatred towards Trump to play against him in the lawsuit. He also said ( and Seth, you cut this out) that the judge was in a society that was 'Pro Mexico' (which isn't a bad thing) which meant that, for the sake of his society, he'd probably have to go against Trump even if Trump was in the right (which I don't know if he was) Y'all wonder why he doesn't like you guys. As soon as he says anything that has to do with<b>  race</b>, you'll say it<b> s racis</b>t. \nAnd one thing they never wanna point out was that Trump said they should go back to where they came from an fix that government and then come back and explain to us how to fix ours (Since they're so PROOOOUUUUD of being women of color, they might as well go improve the countries they were originally from with all that patriotism).

I understand that you may resent people coming now that you're here, because your family went through the legal process which I'm sure took time, and you see the new people as taking shortcuts. But I have compassion for them, because the USA has caused much of the damage in the collapse of their countries. I think if we had given them the aid they need, instead of installing puppet dictators, and exploiting them, their countries would be much more stable now. \nYou've doubtless seen plenty of oppression around you, but you didn't recognize it because it didn't seem to affect you personally.",

If you committed any crime (obviously crime dependant) in a country, you would more than likely be separated from your family.\n\nIllegally crossing the border is a crime that will lead to separation from family. Thats the law and it's not a law that Trump made. Get that clear. You seem to only care now but not that Obama did it AND he deported many people too! The media only cares now because they are against Trump.\n\nFurther to this, the \"treating humans like garbage\". Do you know what the answer would be to sorting this out? More funding.\n\nTrump said that there was a Crisis on the border months ago and the Dems laughed about it and didn't want to give funding. NOW it's such a big thing for them when they are to blame in the first place.\n\nThe only other solution is open borders and no immigration policy...

Getting upset about political things is like being in pre-school and being upset someone drinking out of your juice box, its silly. The man obviously doesnt understand applying context to what he's saying based on his thought process. What im saying is that what he said at its face value was not <b> racist.</b> \"If you are to criticize what Im doing first look at where you originated from. Go back there fix their problems and then come back and tell me what you did and how you did it if it was successful\" is what he was saying. Was it right to say, probably not. Should the man learn to hold his tongue or in his case thumbs, probably.\n\n\nThen again if you look at where they actually are from and apply what he said to that instead of immediately assuming he meant out of country(even with this President anything is possible): \n\n\nOcasio-Cortez is from the Bronx. 2017 report states: The factors include high school graduation rates, obesity, smoking,<b>  mental</b> health, unemployment, access to healthy foods, the quality of air and water, income inequality and teen births in nearly every county in America. The Bronx also had the highest rate of children living in poverty in the state, the report said.\n\n\nAyanna Pressley, Chicago, IL Top 10 issues of concern for residence: Gun violence \u2013 87 percent\r\nBullying and Cyberbullying \u2013 76 percent\r\nPoverty \u2013 74 percent\r\nLack of Adult Supervision \u2013 73 percent<b> \r\nRacis</b>m and Discrimination \u2013 70 percent\r\nRacial Disparities in Health \u2013 69 percent\r\nViolence in School \u2013 68 percent\r\nSocial Media \u2013 65 percent\r\nNot Enough Job Opportunities for Parents \u2013 65 percent\r\nUnsafe Housing \u2013 62 percent\n\n\nRepresentatives Omar, Mogadishu, Somalia. To start with: Fighting, insecurity and lack of state protection, and recurring humanitarian crises had a devastating impact on Somali civilians in 2018. The number of internally displaced people, many living unassisted and at risk of serious abuse, reached an estimated 2.7 million.\n\n\nRashida Tlaib  Detroit, MI  Poverty, poverty, poverty. Lack of growth. Though crime overall has decreased its still considered a 'dangerous' city. Festering problems go unresolved, like regional transit in southeast Michigan and the ridiculously high auto insurance rates in Detroit. Michigan's education system lags the leading states by a lot.\n\n\nInstead of jumping on th<b> e 'raci</b>st' bandwagon that seems to be so popular today if the words of the President were taken in the way presented here and the congress women actually went back to where they were from and made a difference and an genuine impact then would it not serve to the overall benefit of the US? I get it. Sever amounts<b>  of<b>  </b</b>>red tape, greed, speaking w/o thinking and h<b> aving</b> deaf ears to anything outside your belief system is the norm and prevents things from actually moving in the right direction but to call ever<b> ything </b>racis<b> t makes </b<b> >nothin</b>g racist.",

I used to be fascinated by a simple question: if I lived in Germany in the 30's, would I have voted for HItler? Who among my friends would have voted for him? Sadly, this question is less and less hypothetical every day. \n\n\nAnd I'm not concerned about the next two years or four years from now. I'm worried about what we're going to go through 10 years from now--what my kids will have to endure as young adults.",

Fred Trump, however it was spelled, emigrated to American when he was 16 from Bavaria and made his fortune by operating restaurants, and brothels in Seattle and the mining town Monte Cristo, and brothels in the Klondike Gold Rush.  Brothels? Ok the kitty grabbing kissing started with grandpa then. \n\n\nDrumb (I like that spelling) later returned to Bavaria and married.  However, and this is where it gets good, Bavarian authorities accused him of emigrating when he was young to avoid fulfilling his military service!! Holy COW!!  So Drumb avoided military service, this also started with grandpa!  So as a result Drumb lost his Bavarian citizenship and reluctantly he and his family returned to the United States...DAMMIT!!  \n\n\nAnd there you have the proud heritage of Donald Trump, brothels, prostitutes, avoiding military service, father arrested for KKK activities and god knows what else is proof that the nut doesn't fall too far from the tree!",

Given everything Trump has done, given '16 campaign issues alone, there's a high probability Pence would be on trouble/resign if Trump was just impeached by the House, let alone the Senate. If Pelosi had any desire for the presidency, she would have moved at it 20 years ago. \n\nThat said, as a white, openly bisexual, pagan male, i fear Trump far less than Pence. Trump has a almost 3 year long record of bad things, Pence has a 10 year record of bad things; some which border on atrocity level of willful stupidity. \n\nAnyone but Pence 2020. But given the likelihood of Trump being impeached in 2020, any Democrat 2020.",

However, Trump was never saying that the judge couldn't do his job because of his ethnicity; he was saying that the judge would be biased against him because he is of Mexican descent. His parents came here from Mexico. Yes, the case he handled pertained to Trump University, but I think if my parents had come here from Mexico and I was trying a case against a guy who was actively attempting to prevent Mexican people from coming here with a wall, I would find it impossible to be impartial. I want Democrats to skewer Trump each and every time he says something offensive, but let's stop acting like we don't understand the 1% of things he says that actually kind of make sense so that we can spin those into something negative. There's plenty of legit offensive stuff coming out of his mouth on a daily basis; pretending to be stupid only damages our credibility.",

But because she was the heir apparent for so long, it left a lot of time for the right wing to build her up as a<b>  boogie</b> man based on all sorts of fake narratives, conspiracy theories, innuendo, outright lies, and some legit bad things. She definitely wouldn't have been my first choice, but if she was president now, the economy would still be where it is, as much wall would have been built as under Trump, but Iran would still be in compliance with the nuclear deal, all the industries Trump promised to help wouldn't have spent the last two years suffering under tariffs, people at the border would be treated more humanely, our international alliances wouldn't be frayed, the environment wouldn't be getting intentionally decimated at the behest of large corporate sponsors and the constant embarrassing spectacle would be replaced with a dignified presence. So not my first choice at all, but I'm convinced 'anybody but Trump' was always a better position than 'anybody but Clinton.' She'd have been, ehh, okay. \n\nAnyway though, that's all the past.

Seriously - you're making the argument that because you're older (which you don't know), you should just be trusted as correct without making any actual argument. That's literally the argument an eight-year<b>  old</b> makes to a six-yea<b> r ol</b>d. Not very adult of you.\n\nHow about justifying your position. How would Hillary Clinton DESTROY the country pretty quickly with her bland centrist status quo policies? Please be specific. Also, what from your time closely observing her actions as wife of a governor and president illuminated your knowledge of how she was the worst of the worst? Back up your claims, son.\n\nLike I said, I'm not a big supporter of her. But the best Trump supporters ever seem to be able to claim is a stalemate based on false equivalencies. Please actually explain why there is so much HATE of her.",

Crossing the border between ports of entry seeking asylum is actually illegal and is a crime. I might be an asshole but I do know the laws and the constitution. So you think anyone should be able to cross our borders unchecked? I'm guessing you like drug cartels and child traffickers . you would have to because there are a lot of them caught everyday and are In those detention centers. The dems won't tell you but over half of those kids were brought by a non family member. There are thousands of cases of child molestation with those asylum seekers. No not all are bad but the few who are is why we have border laws and a venting process that dems don't want in place . why is that? I really need an explanation",

If your actual name is tour username, I can guess you are or your family is from Southeast Asia. \nNow I don't advocate for that in any way shape or form. Just realize he doesn't care about you or anyone else but other billionaires.",

There were civilian deaths under Obama. That's true. And that's bad. And when Trump came in, one of the first things he did was loosen the rules of engagement restrictions that Obama put in place to protect civilians. Basically, he made it easier to bomb places where civilians would be. Then, he signed an executive order to do away with Obama's executive order that required transparency, forcing the U.S. to publicly report military actions in which there were civilian casualties including estimates of how many were killed. And he even diminished efforts to find out if there were civilian casualties.\n\nSo apples Obama killed civilians, which is bad, but he tried to limit it and held himself out to the public to account for it. And oranges Trump killed civilians, made it easier to kill them by mistake or just as part of acceptable losses, then hid the facts from the public, because hey, if it ain't reported on cable news, it can't make him look bad. Hundreds of innocent civilians could be killed tomorrow in the name of the United States, and the people of the United States would never know about it because of Trump. How do you like them oranges?",

Too incompetent to do anything without totally making a crisis out of it he is in himself a walking global disaster. It will take a decade to scrub clean all the greasy stains of greed and avarice the tiny pick-pocket hands that orange stained and vain, toddler-like grifter and his sleaze-ball sycophants have smeared all over our nation's integrity. He can stare despairing victims of poverty and violence in the face and his only thought is to get his propagandists to exploit \"the optics of the situation\" to his benefit.

From what I've seen from all of these votes in Congress is the Republican party always seem to vote on bettering America and the democrats always vote on bettering themselves and against America. I will give you 3 examples 2 from the past and 1 recent. 1. Every Republican voted to freeing every slave in the United States , every democrat voted against it. 2. Every Republican voted for<b>  woman</b> to have the same rights as men, every democrat voted against it. 3. I'm not sure how much the border Patrol needed for the recent rise in detainees at the border for food beds and more building space but  the Republicans voted for it and no surprise the democrats voted against it. You seeing a pattern yet? It's been this way since during slavery which people like to say the parties switched when in fact they didn't cause the same is happening now. The only real difference is Republicans still believe in working hard for what you get and the constitution. Democrats don't believe in anything except what they can get handed to them. Sad to say and the really sad part it's true.",

The biggest lie ever is that humans live on after death. When the brain dies, that's it. We cease existing and our bodies rot just like all other living things that die. It's nice to think grandma lives on and our enemies suffer, but that's just plain mythological BS taught to keep the masses working hard with a false promise of an afterlife reward and the silly notion that those that treated them badly will suffer. It is hilarious that anyone still believes such nonsense, but politicians count on them to keep believing it.\n\"Religion is regarded by the <b> common </b>people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful.\" Lucius Annaeus Seneca\r (5BC to 65AD) Roman statesman.",

You should look into the historical records and you'll find the democrats were always the racists and ever since<b>  black</b> people got the right to vote they just turned it all around pretending to be the no<b> n racis</b>t party in order to enslave t<b> he bla</b>ck population thru welfare and other measures to keep them bound to th<b> eir </b>old masters. By the way it's all theatre, freemasonry runs both sides and is trying to have the country to collapse from within in order to become social<b> ist/ commu</b>nist under a global new UN like structure after the third WW now that they helped to build up a worthy enemy in the allies between China and Russia against NATO. Ever since they ridiculed Bill Clinton in front o<b> f the n</b>ation for an affair to bring down the office of president, ever since they forced in W.Bush to show the elections were corrupt, ever since they had Hillary come out with Obama not being an American born citizen to bring down the constitution and now purposely created the total divide and non acceptance of a democratic elected president #not my president. They're slowly breaking the US down from within on purpose. Globalism can't handle freedom of speech, gun rights etc. this is a long social engineering scam and fake opposition theatre and your all falling for it Just look into freemasonry presidents/ police/ military/ media/ music industry/ film industry/ banks/ religions/ NASA/ FBI/ CIA/ Fortune 500 companies or the fact that D.C. Is a private Freemason owned city state with Freemason border posts, the world council of freemasonry and a complete Freemason preplanned freemason symbolism planned layout whilst googling the Albert Pike Freemason Luciferian quote from his book reasons and dogma. It's all divide and conquer theatre and you'll falling for it. I'm not even from the US or Americas and it's amazing to me you don't see your living in a total cult controlled theatre country p, neither will you ever crack if this is true, more the 50% of all US presidents openly showed they were members of a secret society a.k.a. A society with secrets and all come from th<b> e sa</b>me old European bloodlines even Obama thru his mother, a luciferian cult and you don't see it. Just like you don't see how Mac Donald's, KFC, Wendy's, White Castle, Whataburger, Taco Bell, Walmart, Unilever, Kraft etc. etc. are all founded by freemasons using food as an official qualified weapons systems. Looking at the US I see how Germans would say \"I didn't know\" when asked about the concentration camp horrors just after the war, almost all people are like ignorant children in denial.",

All West wing Governments and media are pushing the transformation of christian european society into an islamic society. This will be accelerated with mass immigration from undemocratic countries. Young Islamic men who see Western women as whores, hate Jews, hate gays, hate lesbians, hate all Western values, Merkel's government has let millions of them into the country. The effect is In many districts of Germany, the Germans are in the minority and there are many Islamic no go areas, where the police no longer intends. We have daily knife attacks, rapes,<b>  sexual</b> assaults etc., whose numbers have increased rapidly. People who oppose this are called racists and Nazis by left wing media which is 100% in Germany, in my country polygamy, child marriage, honour killings and so on which are imported by the islamic immigrants are tolerated by the Left wing government. It is only a matter of time when religion war will come in Europe. I can recognize the same Pattern in the US. The democrats and their media except FOX try to flood the country with people who do not know democratic western values and reject them. Give these people power in America then America will mutate into a developing country in the near future. I don\u00b4t think that you want to live in countries where the most immigrants come from.

Trump has rebuilt our military and your<b>  negro</b> Muslim Messiah Barrack Hussein Obama gutted our military and also sold 20% of our enriched uranium thru the Uranium One deal ( brokerd by Bob \" I can't find my dick playing pocket pool \" Mueller ) and also let it be know he would have more flexibility after the election on a open Mic to then Russian President to rely a message to then prime minister Putin .........hmmmm more flexibility for what? Anyway you worried about Trump? Hilarious",

A person who behaves in an autocratic way;- he obstructs justice, ignores subpoena's , refuses to be interviewed, calls news reporters the enemy of the people, and that what these reporters say, is fake news!   A ruler with no checks and balances - Trump had no check or balance, when the Republican's held the congress and the white house - and appointed people to his cabinets that were not this president has no military experience - was given 5 deferments for the Vietnam War - he's a coward - and want's to spend millions to massage his ego!  Trump said he would rule for years, if he could!  He wants to be like the leader of China~  If this doesn't scare every American, you truly are delusional and should take a hard look at yourselves - it's bizarre behavior, and we the American People should not allow this to happen~",

Obviously there are similar numbers of Democrat and Republican voters, or the minor party would never be elected.  The swing voters make the difference.  In fact US's political system forces this.  If something is very popular both sides will push it.  If something is very unpopular then both sides will reject it.  It is only the roughly half popular things that parties disagree on.  Which side you vote for is strongly influenced by your birthplace (in the same manner as your beliefs and your sports team).",

It's like the Trump Crime Crew has been in their huddle listening to every play being called by the Democrats from the get go. Simply put, the Press doesn't dwell on all that legislative s**t because The Trump Crime Crew has a fire hose of lies, bad policy, corruption, crime, and racial xenophobic treasonous chaos going 24/7 that drowns out all the regula<b> r ol</b>d stuff that use to make up everyday Wahington life. The dumbass Democrats had only one play after Barr suppressed and mischaracterized the Mueller Report. Impeachment! A live T.V. trial versus The Trump Crime Crew firehose of chaos. That was they're only choice and they blew it. That was the one thing The Trump Crime Crew feared. Witness after witness on live t.v. either lying or pleading the 5th or telling the truth and snitching off those who  committed perjury. And everyday Republican Senators in Swing States up for election would have to justify supporting the Trump Crime Crew on live T.V. as the enti<b> re nati</b>on watches riveted to their screens. That's the only thing that could of overwhelmed the Trump Crime Crew's hold on the daily narrative that continues to make the Democrats look weak and ineffectual. It doesn't matter if the Senate Republicans don't convict. All the better actually. They'll look just as corrupt as the Trump Crime Crew after weeks and weeks of testimony on live T.V. proving without a doubt the Trump Crime Crew's guilt. And I got news for you, Americans may not like hooking up with an asshole  like Trump, but you know what they really don't  like hooking up with?  WEAK AND INEFFECTUAL!  Yeah, Americans would rather be assholes and win then be ineffectual weaklings and lose. That's why Trumps BASE will never go for these weak ass Dems. And more and more of the 2018 Bue Wave are feeling the same. Witness the riff in the Dem Party. Centrist weaklings versus the new tough young \"take no prisoner\" Progressive Liberals like the Squad.

            "commentText": "The Alt-Right, White Nationalists, Right Wingers and Trump fans don't want to hear anything critical about Trump. They only like to hear nice things about Trump. Here come the excuses as they guzzle more of that orange koolaid. \n\nThese are the same fools who voted for small temporary tax cuts for themselves and permanent big tax cuts for billionaires. Who does that!? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n'Trump loves us and he's gon' drain tha' swamp! He's gon' git rid of immigrants and git our jurbs back from Chyyyna. Says he gon' git Mexico to pay for his wall!' \ud83e\udd20\n\nWhat else can you say about those who view Donald Trump and Alex Jones as the 'intellectuals' in the room. They find the Trump family sooo relatable. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThey swarm the comments with little to no contribution to the dialogue. Allow me to demonstrate, lol.\n\nTypical Trump fan response:\n'OH YEAH!!?? OH YEAH!!?? Well what about Hillary yackety, yackety, blagh, Benghazi!!, Emails!, Socialism!, NWO!, NPC!, SJW!, Snowflakes!!, Blacks!, Muslims!!, illegals!!, blugh, illuminati!, blaaagh, bluuugh, Fake News!!, Global Climate Change is a hoax!!, CNN Grrr!!, Q-Anon, Globalists! Obama!!, yackety, Soros!, Gays! Jews!, Wall!!, blaaagh, Deep State!, Flat Earth!!, yackety, yackety, blagh, blagh, bluuugh!'\n\n'What about!? What about!? What about!?'\n\nJust a quick look at their comments and responses and you're sure to find these talking points. They go from bullies, to emotional train wrecks when they see their own words on the table this way. \nThey're left with <b> nothing </b>else but to prove my point. \n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\n Also, do they ever pick up a book? Their lack of knowledge of basic history and current events is jarring. They're so ignorant, that they literally believe there is only one type of Socialism.\n\nThey will always mention Venezuela and Cuba, because that's what Fox News tells them. \nIn terms of healthcare alone, Fox News won't tell them that the following countries have already figured out how to provide at least some basic type of service: \n\nAustralia, Austria, Belarus, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\u2014 Notice Russia is ALSO on that list. Guess who wants to keep Americans morbidly<b>  obese</b>, unhealthy and behind the times? \nDing, ding, ding!! You guessed it!\n\nThe world is more complex than what they're learning from Fox News. Of course, we can't expect them to understand. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02\n\n\ud83e\udd14 \u2b55\ufe0f\nFor those curious, yes, I authored this post. I make adjustments as I see fit. My first choice is Bernie Sanders. I'll still vote for any of those candidates in place of Trump. If it upsets some ignorant ass right wingers so be it. Don't act like I just pulled those quotes out of my ass. The reason you recognize them is because we've all heard them countless of times when debating them.  So, I say to them: I'm finished trying to educate any of you on social and political issues. You are a laughing stock just like Trump when other world leaders literally laugh at him, (not with him). \ud83d\ude02\n\nTo the good people out there not falling for the right wing BS, much love and respect to you! \u270a\ufe0f\n\nYour friend,\n\n\u2014 BIZWIZ \u2665\ufe0f \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",
