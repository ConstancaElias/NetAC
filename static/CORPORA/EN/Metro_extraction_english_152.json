        "postText": "A mother has found herself at the centre of a race row after she was kicked out of an 80s tribute night for \u2018blacking up\u2019 as pop icon Prince.', 'Catherine McBride, 47, insisted she wasn\u2019t racist and said it was a \u2018bit of fun\u2019 after she painted her face in dark foundation to resemble the singer.', 'But staff at Glasgow\u2019s Pavilion Theatre asked her to take off the make-up or leave the 80s Mania event after receiving complaints.', 'The mother, of Pollock, Glasgow, told the Daily Record the incident ruined her night, which she had been enjoying with nine of her friends who were also in fancy dress \u2013 although no one else had painted their face.', 'She told the news site: \u2018I was only trying to have a laugh and would never have deliberately set out to cause any offence to anyone.\u2019', 'McBride claimed a worker on the door of the Pavilion said she liked her fancy dress and they had a laugh about it, before other party-goers inside asked to take photos with her.', 'She said she had no idea there was anything wrong and sat down to enjoy the show.', 'But soon a member of theatre management took her to one side and said six punters had complained after being offended by her \u2018blacked up\u2019 costume.', 'She told the Daily Record: \u2018I\u2019ve worn the exact same outfit before at a friend\u2019s birthday party in a local pub and nobody said a word. I was totally taken aback when all of this happened.\u2019', 'McBride said she rubbed off the make-up with kitchen roll and questioned why staff didn\u2019t say something when she first entered the theatre.', 'She claimed hundreds were at the event but \u2018only six complained\u2019 and said it was \u2018a bit of an overreaction\u2019.', 'The mother added she thought it was a \u2018bit out of order\u2019 and thinks people took it the wrong way.', 'Zandra Yeaman, of the Coalition for Racial Equality and Rights, said the history of blackface is \u2018rooted in racist bigotry and is a legacy of slavery\u2019 and people should be more aware of how offensive it is.', 'Pavilion general manager Iain Gordon said: \u2018We received complaints and didn\u2019t want the situation to escalate. We decided to ask the individual to remove the make-up, which she agreed to do.\u2019",

The lighter the better, that mindset was so ingrained that it carries on to this day for many countries that were colonised. \" Okay, what about a different historic context, my ancestors in Eastern Europe did not had the privilege to be the \"colonisers\", they were the \"colonised\" during the Ottoman by the converted former Byzantines. I find it kinda bafling how they are completely ignored considering ppl are still moaning about the trans-atlantic slavery and the woes of the ancestors of <b> Black </b>ppl in the West. That was a bit of a side note, but my actual question in that context is: If what you are claiming is true, then why in the arabic slave trade, including in the Ottoman itself, where White ppl were being opprossed by non-White \"collonialists\", the valued and the cheapest among the slaves were<b>  Black</b> women, like say the Nubians. \"Nubian girls were the cheapest and least popular, fetching up to 20 pounds sterling.\"  [LINK]  girls were described as fair and light-skinned and were frequently enslaved by Crimean Tatars then sold to Ottoman empire to live and serve in a Harem. They were the most expensive, reaching up to 500 pounds sterling, and the most popular with the Turks. Second in popularity were Syrian girls, with their dark eyes, dark hair, and light brown skin, and came largely from coastal regions in Anatolia. Their price could reach up to 30 pounds sterling. They were described as having \"good figures when young\". Nubian girls were the cheapest and least popular, fetching up to 20 pounds sterling.\" Something doesn't add up applying your logic here.",

From the tone of your writing I would say that you my son have a chip on your shoulder and could in fact be a <b> racist </b>yourself!  However the phrase White Privilege does not offend me, it just makes me laugh at how other races see us \"whites\".  Let me guess, you think we all live in 42 room mansions with servants and staff to wait on us hand and foot and we all go out on the boxing day shoot in our Range Rovers, and pay little Timmy 50p to keep the dogs on the leads until its time to go home for tea and scones",

It was more a statement saying that for me I dont care if someone calls me a name because of my colour, <b> race,</b> or religion because to me it doesnt matter, its just a word.  To me, in an ideal world people would be able to impersonate people to a degree without any offence being intended, and that goes for everyone and in all directions.  I just feel the world has got to a point that<b>  nobody</b> can do anything without someone taking offence.  Dont get me wrong there needs to be boundries but would I get offended if an American or Austrailian or Canadian turned up to a party dressed as William Wallace with bright ginger hair and wearing a kilt and sporren carrying a haggis? - no I would just laugh and take the piss out of their country in some way shape or form.  Thats the problem though many people have become so bitter towards people who intend no actual harm and intend no offence, and to be fair I think anyone with any brains can tell the difference between harmless banter and deep roote<b> d racis</b>m.",

From Antiquity, European slaves were <b> common </b>during the reign of Ancient Rome and were prominent during the Ottoman Empire into the early modern period. In Feudalism, there were various forms of status below the Freeman that is known as Serfdom (such as the bordar, villein, vagabond and slave) which could be bought and sold as property and were subject to labor and branding by their owners or demense. Under Muslim rule, the Arab slave trades that included Caucasian captives were often fueled by raids into European territories or were taken as children in the form of a blood tax from the families of citizens of conquered territories to serve the empire for a variety of functions. In the mid-19th century, the term 'white slavery' was used to describe the Christian slaves that were sold into the Barbary slave trade.

I'm glad the term White Privilege doesn't offend you since it's not suppose to offend you, you seem a bit sensitive with an ego at the same time. If you don't think White Privilege exist then you're sheltered or living under a rock and if you think only rich white men are privileged then think again. Enjoy your Tea and Scones",
