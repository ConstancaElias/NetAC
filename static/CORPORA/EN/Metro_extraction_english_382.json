Bettel's lack of good manners was appalling - how rude not to have prevented the rabble from getting so close that neither he nor Mr Johnson could be heard - and then mocking the latter at the \"press conference\" later.  You don't treat a head of state like that, whether you like him or not - especially if you're only the head of a tiny little country like Luxembourg whose population is only a tenth of Britain's - and almost half of those are foreigners.",

These idiots and their placards should have been removed. so the main speakers could have been heard. a loudspeaker, really?. The PM of Luxembourg found it amusing. it would appear. They need to all take a does of 'Grow the hell up' and realise they are interfering in political matters that they have not voted on. While they may not like the man or even his politics, he is our PM and represents all of us. like it or not, and he should be, if not shown respect, at least not have to deal with the 'pathetic placard numpties' when he is trying to negotiate politically. They should be ashamed of themselves. He did the right thing by walking away and refusing to engage. That was like the middle finger, to everyone of them. Good on you Boris!",
