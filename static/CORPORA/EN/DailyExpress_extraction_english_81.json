', 'I don\u2019 t take it personally.', 'I see it as I was doing my job.I was honoured to speak out on behalf of American values and our democracy. ', 'Mrs Clinton accused the Russian president of exhibiting sexism, and said she believes it is the fact she 's a woman that seemed to get him agitated.', 'As she said this the room ruptured with applause and laughter.', 'Mrs Clinton, who appeared to give a candid and honest interview tried to put Mr Putin in the psychologist's chair and analysed his behaviour.', 'She also argued that the reason for the Russian leader's behaviour is because he is tied up with his anger and disappointment following the collapse of the Soviet Union.', 'Mrs Clinton took a swipe at US President Donald Trump in the wake of his United Nations speech where he said he would totally destroy North Korea.', 'He also described the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as a rocket man.', ' Her dislike for Donald Trump shone through the interview. ', 'Mrs Clinton said: I thought it was very dark, dangerous, not the kind of message that the leader of the greatest nation in the world should be delivering.'",
