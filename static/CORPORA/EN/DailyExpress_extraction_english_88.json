        "postText": "Lawmakers slammed the government\u2019s decision to drop a clause setting the minimum age of consent at 15 on grounds it violated an adult\u2019s presumption of innocence.', 'The bill, which still needs to be debated in the Senate, was approved by a 115 to 29 vote, while 25 MPs abstained.', 'While the majority of centrists voted in favour of the bill, conservative Republicans abstained and leftists voted against.', 'Most \u2013 even those who approved the bill \u2013 deplored gender equality minister Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa\u2019s decision to drop a key clause and much-trumpeted promise to set the minimum age of sexual consent at 15.', 'While French law currently states that it is illegal for an adult to have sexual relations with a child under the age of 15, it is not considered rape if the victim consented to the act.', 'Mrs Schiappa tried to rectify this by setting the age of consent at 15, but the State Council \u2013 the country\u2019s highest administrative court \u2013 warned the age limit could violate an adult\u2019s presumption of innocence (as the case would be automatically treated as rape) and would be declared unconstitutional.', 'Forced to find a middle ground, the government changed the text, adding instead a provision \u2013 \u201cArticle 2\u201d \u2013 stating that rape and sexual assault could result from an \u201cabuse of vulnerability\u201d of the victim.', 'Critics argued that the law fails to protect the victims of sexual violence, as minors under the age of 15 will still have to \u201cprove\u201d a rape took place.', 'Republican MP St\u00e9phane Viry told Mrs Schiappa she had \u201clost his vote\u201d after she failed to impose a minimum age of consent, while socialist lawmaker Marietta Karamanli urged her to \u201ccome back with a new draft\u201d of the text.', 'Centrist lawmaker Isabelle Florennes said: \u201cWe are extremely disappointed by your decision to backtrack on your promise.\u201d', 'Despite the controversy surrounding \u201cArticle 2,\u201d other provisions in the bill have been praised as effective tools to combat sexism and sexual violence.', 'The legislation extends the statute of limitations for child rape claims from 20 to 30 years and imposes on-the-spot fines of 90 euros (\u00a378.7) for street harassment.', 'But the \u201csexist outrage\u201d fine has also come under fire. Far-right lawmaker Emmanuelle M\u00e9nard warned of a looming \u201cwitch-hunt against men,\u201d adding that the fine would blur the line between innocent flirtation and sexual harassment.', 'Centrist lawmaker Erwann Balanant argued that while police officers could not protect every woman from would-be harassers, the fine would help create a social \u201ctaboo\u201d.",
