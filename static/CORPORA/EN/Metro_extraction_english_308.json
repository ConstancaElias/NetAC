        "postText": "On July 7 this year, for the first time, I felt ashamed to be a cis lesbian.', 'For those who don\u2019t know, cis or cisgender means that a person\u2019s gender identity is the same as their birth sex.', 'To the incredulous eyes of the thousands watching, a small group of cis lesbians hijacked the front of Pride in London\u2019s parade and led the march for most of the route. The incident shocked many in the LGBT+ community.', 'Since then, I\u2019ve battled with a barrage of negative feelings. Anger. Rage. Betrayal. How could these women, claiming to represent my sexuality, do something so hurtful and bigoted?', 'It\u2019s a pivotal moment for trans and non-binary people\u2019s rights in our country. And, more than ever, cis lesbians need to step up and proactively show their support for the trans community.', 'On October 19, the consultation for the government\u2019s reform of the Gender Recognition Act 2004 (GRA) will close.', 'This review presents the opportunity to introduce a self-identification system by which trans people would be able to legally change their gender, an approach implemented in countries like Belgium, Norway and Denmark.', 'Currently, the process for legally changing genders is overly bureaucratic, intrusive and dehumanising.', 'Trans people must be diagnosed with gender dysphoria, which implies that being trans is a medical illness, before proving that they have lived in their \u2018acquired gender\u2019 for at least two years.', 'Non-binary people, meanwhile, still have no legal recognition in this country.', 'Although the government has said it wants to de-medicalise the way to legally change gender, nothing is guaranteed.', 'As a government press release stated on October 14: \u2018This is an open consultation \u2013 we are not putting forward any specific proposals for how we want the system to change.\u2019', 'Cis lesbians, then, need to add their weight to the trans rights movement by responding to the GRA. It only takes 10 minutes.', 'Following the Pride in London controversy, a minority of anti-trans lesbians have continued to deny the basic rights of trans people on social media.', 'Trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF) groups, too, are urging their supporters to fill out the GRA consultation stating their opposition to self-ID.', 'With a significant number of these TERFs identifying as lesbians, it\u2019s imperative that other lesbians and queer women counter their anti-trans arguments by lodging our own responses.', 'In particular, these TERF organisations and individuals have mistakenly claimed that the introduction of self-ID would allow trans women access to public toilets and facilities which, they say, would make them unsafe.', 'Apart from anything else, this fear-mongering viewpoint is completely incorrect.', 'Trans people have been able to use public bathrooms matching their gender identity for years, following the introduction of the Equality Act back in 2010.', 'And, as one recent US survey found, there is no empirical evidence to show that allowing transgender people to use the public facility of their choice would increase violations of privacy and crime.', 'Given the events of recent months, cis lesbians have a moral duty to campaign for trans equality.', 'Heart-warmingly, many cis lesbians have already demonstrated that they can do this. The hashtag LwiththeT has been shared shared by thousands on Twitter, and, in Manchester, a group of lesbians led the city\u2019s Pride parade carrying banners in support of trans people.', 'Still, as trans allies, we need to keep on battling.', 'It\u2019s not always easy to stand up for what\u2019s right.', 'Reporting on trans issues for PinkNews, I\u2019ve repeatedly been bombarded with abuse online. On multiple occasions, I\u2019ve been reduced to muting my notifications on Twitter so as to stem the onslaught of angry comments.', 'I\u2019ve also heard first-hand about the detrimental impact this bullying is having on trans people\u2019s mental health.', 'As lesbians, we know all too well what discrimination feels like \u2013 and we have a social responsibility to champion the rights of trans people.', 'The reform of the GRA is long overdue. We must continue to fight for the rights of trans and non-binary people. Not just with hashtags and at Pride parades \u2013 but by taking on the administrative, nitty-gritty stuff too.', 'Let\u2019s defy and drown out the voices of this small clique of hurtful individuals claiming to represent our sexuality.', 'You can Come Out For Trans Equality here.",

            "commentText": "This is the second biased \"news\" story the Metro has printed this week. I assume on the basis of balance you will now publish 2 articles by women who have not been inducted into the cult that believes <b> sex </b>and<b>  gender</b> are the same thing.And I cannot imagine how any self respectin<b> g lesbia</b>n would think it is okay to criticise others lesbians who refuse to engage sexually with a full intact male who claims he is not only<b>  a wom</b>an bu<b> t a lesb</b>ian. That is tantamount to condoning rape. It is frightening to think that young women away from home for the first time at university are being harrased by these MRAs and their hand maidens.The GRA is a legal fict<b> ion. No</b>body can change <b> thei</b>r sex. It is biologically impossible. Why should men who want to adopt femine dress and stereotypical female interests need a certificate to do this. And equally the same for women who want to behave and dress in a way that is said to be typically male.This is the most reactionary and outdated notion there is. We are not living in the world of the Stepford Wives.Where and how were this young people born up that they are so hide bo<b> und by </b>gender stereo types that they even think the arguement is rational.How you decide to live doesn't need a certificate. What is needed is more campaigning against the da<b> mage of</b> gender stereotypes. In the 70s this started to happen, but the male backlash against women's liberation lead to a socially conservative r<b> eturn t</b>o gender steriotypes peddled by hollywood and other media.These young people who spout the trans ideology are as reactionary as Victorians or fundamentalists.Everydoby saw through the fiction that Rachel Dolezal<b>  (a wh</b>ite woman) could i<b> dentif</b>y as black. It's just biologically not possible.In fact what has happened is that now many people are seeing that the original GRA was a con and are looking at getting i<b> t re</b>pea<b> led. Se</b>x and gender are not the same thing.If society is trying to force you t<b> o behav</b>e in a gender conforming way you dont like, dont give in, stand up and fight back.

It is a derogatory label applied to anyone - including even trans folk themselves - who stand up for women against the transcult. But mostly it's a means of dehumanising women, dismissing our legitimate concerns as not worthy of consideration and setting us up as targets for male violence as I know from personal experience.
