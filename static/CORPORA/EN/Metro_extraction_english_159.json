        "postText": "A pensioner launched a racist tirade against a Sainsbury\u2019s security guard and told him: \u2018You don\u2019t belong here\u2019.', 'The abuse was filmed by another customer at the Sainsbury\u2019s Local on Woolwich Road in London and the man can be heard in the footage yelling: \u2018What are you f***ing doing here?\u2019', 'He continues: \u2018You\u2019re telling me what to do. I belong here. You don\u2019t. F*** off.\u2019', 'Several members of staff at the shop, between Greenwich and Woolwich, along with the security team involved were left in shock by the man\u2019s comments.', 'The targeted security guard remains calm throughout the abuse.', 'When one man intervened, the pensioner added: \u2018He\u2019s telling me what to do.', '\u2018You heard what I said. I belong here. I\u2019m trying to get served. It\u2019s got nothing to do with you.\u2019', 'The woman filming the video then adds: \u2018The man is doing his job, it\u2019s not about where he comes from.', '\u2018Do not start on me because I was born here. There\u2019s kids in this shop, who wants to serve you?', '\u2018Damn cheek. Do not serve him, this is out of order.\u2019', 'Staff refused to serve the man and escorted him out of the shop.', 'He then screamed: \u2018F*** you, fuck this shop, f*** the lot of you.\u2019', 'He added as he left: \u2018This is why this f***ing country is in the state it\u2019s in.\u2019', 'The woman filming then tells the staff: \u2018Well done, guys.\u2019', 'Miranda Slade, who lives up the road from the shop, said the woman showed her and staff the footage on Saturday.', 'Miranda told Metro.co.uk: \u2018The lady said that she wanted it on camera as she believed the man was going to physically attack the staff and she was also worried that he would be backed up by people committing an acid attack.', '\u2018But I\u2019m not sure if this is something the man threatened, or just what she feared.', '\u2018The staff told me that the gentleman in the video is actually a well-known regular, who is normally very pleasant to the staff, however on this Friday evening he came in drunk and aggressive.\u2019', 'She said she believes the video was filmed on Friday evening.', 'A Sainsbury\u2019s spokeswoman said they are \u2018aware\u2019 of the video.",
