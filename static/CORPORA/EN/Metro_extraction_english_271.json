        "postText": "A generous sister has given her brother and his partner the gift of life by volunteering to be their baby\u2019s surrogate mother.', 'Chapelle Cooper, 27, made the life changing decision after discussing how expensive and complicated the adoption process can be.', 'Her brother Scott Stephenson and partner Michael Smith were also concerned about finding a trustworthy surrogate.', 'They say they were \u2018blown away\u2019 when Chapelle made her offer and said it was like \u2018a dream come true\u2019.', 'Chapelle delivered Harper Elizabeth Smith 15 days early on Friday morning, weighing five pounds eight ounces.', 'Her egg was used with Michael\u2019s sperm, making her both Harper\u2019s biological mother and \u2018auntie\u2019.', 'The couple said: \u2018We were so worried about Chapelle throughout the labour but she made us so proud.\u2019', 'Michael says he and Scott made some ground rules from the very start of the pregnancy.', 'He said: \u2018We weren\u2019t going to be controlling about her diet and tell her what she could and couldn\u2019t do but we are control freaks by nature.', '\u2018We found ourselves really protective of her throughout the pregnancy.', '\u2018We\u2019re always going to be honest with Harper and tell her how she was made. We always want her auntie to be a part of her life.\u2019', 'Scott and Michael, who live in Blackpool, are engaged and first met five years ago.', 'They started looking into adoption three years before Chapelle made her offer.', 'Chapelle said she is \u2018still going to be a big part of her life\u2019 but taking on the role of \u2018auntie\u2019 rather than as her mother.', 'She added: \u2018I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve done it if I\u2019d never seen her again which made it a lot easier.\u2019', 'Scott says the whole process has been an \u2018absolutely whirlwind\u2019 and a \u2018really wonderful experience\u2019 which has brought the family closer together.', 'He added: \u2018Who can say they\u2019ve done that for somebody else. It\u2019s the most selfless and amazing gift.\u2019",
