Go the extra mile, prove you're worth more than X and employer will pay it. If you've a problem with the wage, don't apply in the first place and let someone else have a crack of the whip.",

They increase the minimum wage every year but the threshold for benefit entitlement will stay the same. \"Oh your \u00a36.23 over the threshold for your benefits?\" Blam!! Were taking all your monthly benefits off you, you make enough money now,deal with it. Like that the government wins and we always lose. Inflation means the price of everyday items will be more expensive anyways so won't make any difference,it'd make a difference now not then. Theres a big difference between National Minimum Wage &amp; National Living Wage, ones mandatory the other isn't....guess which one isn't?",
