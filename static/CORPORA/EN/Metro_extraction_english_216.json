        "postText": "A woman has been filmed carrying out a racist rant at a fellow passenger on a train filled with protesters on their way home from an anti-racism march.', 'Passengers said they intervened as the woman aggressively complained someone had sat in her seat, demanding to see her train ticket, telling her to \u2018f*** off\u2019 and repeatedly calling her a \u2018foreign b***ard\u2019.', 'Witnesses offered solidarity to the victim, an Asian woman, by telling the white aggressor \u2018we are foreign too\u2019.', 'The incident took place on the 8.25pm train from London Euston to Birmingham New Street on Saturday as many passengers were returning from a UN Anti-Racism Day rally in the capital.', 'The person filming it said: \u2018I was utterly disgusted by the behaviour of this racist train passenger, and the racially abusive things she said to other passengers.', '\u2018As some form of bizarre defence, she even claimed she was \u201cforeign\u201d herself, which her friend later confirmed as untrue.', '\u2018Regardless, her behaviour was abhorrent and her views wholly inappropriate, more so as it was international anti-racism day, and only a day after a racist terrorist massacre in New Zealand where similar views led to the murder of 50 innocent Muslims.\u2019', 'Witnesses said the Asian passenger eventually gave up her seat but the confrontation continued.', 'It has been claimed the abusive woman mocked her accent during the stand-off, then again in conversation with her friends.', 'Passengers who saw the incident claim the white woman said: \u2018If she gets off at Coventry, I\u2019ll kill her.\u2019', 'She and other people travelling with her eventually got off the train at Coventry station.', 'The London rally marking the UN International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination saw more than 10,000 people march from Park Lane to Whitehall, stopping to pay their respects along the way at New Zealand House embassy.",
