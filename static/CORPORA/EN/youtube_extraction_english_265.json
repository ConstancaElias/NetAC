In a typical fashion antisemitism is confused as something that is just happening without causation to anything real, and is lopped into <b> blind </b<b> >racism</b> or hatred without cause.",

I remembered first as a vision, then as it were a dream and then clearly as I had been there and stood by.  I was in a far bright valley with no trees several miles across and there a great army of Angles maneuvered in great turnings of Close order drill. And there were many and the rocks of the valley shook and they sang a new song to the God of Heaven and I knew he heard the new song rise to him. And for the goodness of the Song they sang they had a very great anointing upon them. The strength of God was with them.   And the loudness of their praise added to the shaking of the rocks. I knew they exercised control for any louder and the Rocks would break and a great shaking would occur and give away the position where the Army of the Angeles of God readies for the will of God. \n      Bless Israel. You will know he is there . Pierce on tv says \"You know\".",

He dosen't believe in god., so he exuse himself by killing people who do?  What good would that do for that man?    His disturbed and his own lifes misery is to take it out on someone else.",

Schau dir mal die Kritik an wie diese Statistik ensteht (https://www.watson.de/deutschland/exklusiv/941125735-im-zweifel-rechts-die-kriminalstatistik-und-ihr-problem-mit-antisemitischen-straftaten).\n\nZitat: \"Es sind die Polizeibeamten in den jeweiligen Revieren vor Ort, die politisch motivierte Straftaten melden. Sie haben ein Formular auszuf\u00fcllen, die \"Kriminaltaktische Anfrage in F\u00e4llen Politisch motivierter Kriminalit\u00e4t (KTA-PMK)\". (Abgefragt werden zum Beispiel Tatzeit, Tatort, umfangreiche Daten zu Tatverd\u00e4chtigen, eventuell verwendeten Waffen, zu Opfern, zu Sch\u00e4den, zu Verletzungen usw.) Die Erfassungskriterien sind l\u00e4nder\u00fcbergreifend einheitlich. Der Beamte muss entscheiden, welchem \"Ph\u00e4nomenbereich\" er eine Straftat zuordnet, m\u00f6glich sind hier \"rechts\", \"links\", \"ausl\u00e4ndische Ideologie\", \"religi\u00f6se Ideologie\" und \"nicht zuzuordnen\".\"\n\nDas Problem ist dass es anscheinend einen Automatismus gibt bei dem die Straftat dem rechten Spektrum zugeordnet wird, wenn man nicht wei\u00df wer es war (anstatt \"nicht zuzuordnen\" auszuw\u00e4hlen).\n\nZitat: \"Die meisten Landeskriminal\u00e4mter best\u00e4tigen einen solchen Automatismus. Sofern keine gegenteiligen Tatsachen zur T\u00e4termotivation vorliegen, lande eine solche antisemitische Schmiererei in der pmk-rechts.\"\n\nWer macht das mit Sicherheit?\n- Ein klares \"Ja\" kommt vom LKA in Berlin.\n- Auch das Saarland best\u00e4tigt, dass eine solche Tat bundeseinheitlich der PMK-rechts zugeordnet wird.\n- Das LKA-Sachsen beantwortet ebenfalls die Frage nach dem Automatismus mit \"Ja\". Grundlagen daf\u00fcr best\u00fcnden in bundeseinheitlichen Regelungen, hei\u00dft es.\n\n\nWenn man sich mal zur\u00fcck lehnt und nachdenkt erscheint einem 95% auch ziemlich hoch oder nicht (das w\u00e4re eine sehr hohe Aufkl\u00e4rungsquote)? Deswegen gab es meinen urspr\u00fcnglichen (schlampigen) Kommentar.",

They are occupying territory that belongs to Israel and on top of that they want to make Islam the state religion. Palestinian Christians don't even get involved because they know the Jews are right. If they don't know that, they are not Christian. So again if Israel and Jews are so horrible, how are they the only democracy in the Middle East? And why hen do the Palestinians and many others want so bad to live there??",

Yes, many Muslims tend to be radical, aggressive, violent and opressive against women.\n\nHowever, we have to see the bigger picture and have to understand that 2015 was inevitable - and in fact by many anticipated long before. \n\nBecause of the Dublin Agreement, Greece, Spain and Italy would have been responsible for checking all the asylum applications of all these people back in 2015, wether they were actual refugees or third world immigrants. This was an impossible job to do for these three countries alone. In order to help our partner states in the EU, we had to take those people from them and were checking those applications here. That is because you have to actually see them and talk to them, when you are checking their applications (my girlfriend works in public administation). Ultimately this wasn't done because of humanistic reasons, but selfishness. Leaving the problem with Spain, Italy and Greece would have destroyed the trust in the EU - I mean, what would it be worth, if we didn't help our partners? \n\nI will be honest, there have been problems, however things have improved a lot recently. Most radicals have been deported and reasonable laws have been established. Not everything is perfect, but I hope you see, Germany wasn't simply being naive.",
