        "postText": " The gender pay gap is not caused by women earning less than men for the same job. It is largely because women choose different careers and suffer a 'motherhood penalty''.. . Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.st/2Bnu9E9 . . Women who work full-time, still earn 15% less than men. But that's not because they are paid less for the same jobs. It's because they're in different jobs.. . Women are in less senior jobs. In Britain, France and Germany, 80-90% of executive jobs are held by men.  Women also tend to choose different occupations.. . In America over 80% of teachers, nurses, secretaries, and health workers are female and these jobs tend to be lower paid. Primary school teachers in the West earn nearly 20% less than the average graduate job. . . Nurses earn less than police officers. Cleaners less than caretakers. . . Women are as ambitious as men. They earn the majority of university degrees. In America, they now ask for promotions as often as men.. . But it's the price women pay for motherhood that holds them back. In Britain, 70% of mothers reduced their working hours or switched to a less demanding job compared with 11% of fathers.. . In Australia it's 56% of mothers and 19% of fathers, while in France 55% of mothers scaled back compared to 13% of fathers.. . When an American women goes back to work her salary is on average lower than it would have been if she hadn't had a child. . . The race for gender equality is far from over. As more children choose non-traditional careers and men do more childcare, fewer working women will be held back.. . Daily Watch: mind-stretching short films throughout the working week.. .

Next show the dangerous choices of work that men do that women choose not to after you figure out it is the same pay, it will show from men's choices of dangerous jobs that it adds up to 14% for men to who choose dangerous jobs women choose not to do leaving it out of the 100%/100% equation, let the 14% set off to the side by men choosing to do dangerous jobs women choose not to do by averages of pay.

I looked at the data here in the US for actual full time employees, and the local job boards and was happy to find I could save about 20% getting women to work instead of having to pay men.  It wasn't like I'd get any more value out of paying men either, so why would I hire more men.  This helps women too in the end, since they are more likely to get employed, because they are cheaper.  Trump came in at just the right time, as my retail business has grown to the point where this helps a lot in terms of my profits too.  There is new legislation coming into place that will block the Equal Right Amendment from ever passing, which will allow employers to profit by better margins, and women to benefit by having more opportunities.  \n\nThis is good for everyone, and in fact, because many of my employees wind-up working another job, I don't have to pay all the benefits and related overhead.  Again, what's good for me as the employer in terms of lower cost women means I can take advantage of more women employees.  In my industry women generally do not push for as much time off, or a raise nearly as often.  In fact, I had to fir several men over the past few years who wanted raises when they were already getting 15-25% more than my girls.  Also, the women wind up learning more skills by working a second or other jobs, and as such, I find that they have more breadth and depth of experience than the men.  \nSo note to other women\u2014 SHUT UP, before you ruin it for all of us by trying to get equal wages.",

Or do they only want equality in the \"more desirable\" fields such as science?\nIf women want to get rid of the <b> gender </b>wage gap you have a few choices\n1. Choose to get the same job position as a male whos wage you wish to match, rather than something that's just slightly similar (i.e cleaners and janitors are two different things)\n2. Don't have children. If you don't have children you're not going to have any more time away from work than male colleagues so you won't end up with less experience or less opportunities to do overtime and achieve performance based bonus. If a<b>  woman</b> takes a year away from work to bring up children, when she returns anyone who didn't have time off and started at the same time as her will now have 1 year more experience which may be beneficial when promotions come up\n3. If not having kids like option 2 is something you can't live with then have a kid, take the minimal possible amount of time off, then go out to work and earn money to support your family and instead let the father take the time off and look after the kid and you support them both.\n\nThe problem is lots of women want the perks and benefits of the way males sometimes earn more, but they don't want the extra responsibility that comes with them.",

Plus I think some people might think twice about a <b> woman </b>being qualified to work in construction, mines, tech, executive, pilot, and other male dominated jobs.  I worked male dominated jobs and some people thought I was one of the clients not the employee.  Plus women might face second guessing because people assume she might have a baby or might have children even though not all women have babies or children.  Plus why should teachers make less.  They do work outside the classroom like preparing lessons and grading and even after school plus they provide a valuable service which is educating our next generation so they become productive citizens and we have a robust workforce in the future.  And I thought nurses do make good money so I'm confused about it stating officers make more.  I know one nurse who was able to go on several trips and is a single mother.  Another one owned a big house and had 4 children.  Also I don't see anything wrong with a<b>  woman</b> having a baby.  Having children have their benefits and I think it's good that women spend more time with their children so that they can raise them good to become productive citizens with good morals and values.  I do agree staying out of work would keep your earning potential the same or even decrease it depending on what field you work in.  You would just have to accept it as a mother.",

All these statistics being thrown out by the hard left compare the salaries of full time working males and females and don't take into account how much overtime was worked, the position, or years in the position. Men earn more for several reasons, the choose work that usually has higher risk and demand. For example, working away from home, working copious amounts of over time, being in actual full time positions. Women tend to work less hours, gravitate to working cushier jobs, and hold more part time positions, and usually end up having children which forces them to take less hours and sets them back from growing in a position because they can't put in the hours to move up. \n\nIf women want to earn as much as men then it's simple, work the jobs that we do, work the professions that have a high death rates, go be Powerline technicians, iron workers, roofers, truck drivers, I encourage you. But no most women want to be nurses, work as office admins, or be hair dressers. Your choice in careers are your fault, if you want equal earnings then earn it. The thing about this generation is people want hand outs and don't want to work for anything.",

            "commentText": "When I applied for a management position at the company I work for, the bosses doing the hiring asked my fellow coworkers which of 'us' they would prefer to get the management position.  By 'us', I mean, they asked about all the male applicants and none of the female applicants.  None of my coworkers were even aware that I had actually applied.  I had told them, but they had assumed that I meant I was planning to apply, but never did, as my name was not listed as an applicant.\n\nAfterwards, I spoke to my coworker who had been given the management position.  He was shocked that my hourly pay was less than the state's max threshold for overtime pay.  Even though he had 2 years less experience in the job, he had been paid above that threshold.  After 5 raises, I am still making $1.75 per hour less than that threshold.  This is against labor laws that are meant to guarantee pay parity for men and women working the same job with the same experience.  There is a loophole to that law, though, as proof of violating the law needs to be shown on the company's pay records, and the company chose to 'not keep any records of that sort of information'.\n\nThere is a pay gap, and it's not that women simply choose to be paid less.  It's that many company's in the US have chosen to not record key pay information, the legal system relies on letting companies self-regulate and self-report violations of labor law (like allowing a child to rat themselves out if they have their hand in the cookie jar - kids aren't going to get themselves in trouble by ratting themselves out and neither are companies), and chalking it all up to women having babies or being overly emotional or just plain lying, even though that's not the case.\n\nI really do miss the military's payscale.  Paygrade (basically, rank), time in service (basically, experience), allowances (annual set pay for purchasing new uniforms), and special pay (hazard pay for deployment to combat zones, etc.) were factored in; <b> gender </b>was not.  Women with the same rank, time in service, and who were in the same situation (both located in a combat zone or both assigned to the same duty station, etc.) were paid the same amount that men were.  It's not hard to set up a system like that civilian-side, but until it becomes mandatory for companies to track and report pay records or it becomes possible to admit worker's pay stubs as evidence of pay disparity when any group reports a company for labor law violations.\n\nAs far as the MGTOW/men's rights denial that the pay gap exists when women demand fair and equal pay for equal work in the same job with the same experience, I find it odd that so many of them are upset about women in porn getting paid more than men.  Honestly, using a pay system like the military pay system would fix that, too, yet the MGTOWs, men's rights advocates, top company executives, and shareholders who fight against admitting a pay gap exists in any other job have been against implementing any such system.",

If they were they would be taking over the jobs that men have been doing in high positions, but they do not want to compete at the elite level whereas men do.

The evidence points to that only being one cause, willingness to put your personal and family life to the side is a major factor when you have to compete for the top jobs.  What do expect men to do just because women carry the child, role over and just give up the job they've fought for their entire career!? Yeah I'll sell tickets to this if you want!",

Why are people saying we must have 'equality of outcome'? Men and Women are different -- thats ok.......equally valued...but different. Should we force people, by some kind of tyranny or social engineering, into careers against their desire or calling? Ex. must we be 50/50 split in careers such as <b> engineers,</b> nurses, steel workers, and fire fighters? I think not. I've heard the natural ratios in careers such as nursing and engineering - if people are left to their own desires/interests/aptitude - is something like 10:1.\n\nI'll say that the traditional mother (stay-at-home or work part-time) is an extremely undervalued thing today. This article suggests that women giving any more attention or effort to children/family than men is an obstacle to 'gender / pay equality'. And suggesting that we must close this gap in the name of 'being progressive' is a frightening prospect. (sarcasm: Geeee....what a burden child raising is for natural families. If only we could put all children over the<b>  age</b> of 3 months into the hands of qualified state-supervised professionals, then we could achieve full equality....what an accomplishment that would be).",

Women often pull the drawbridge up behind them and I have seen this so many times. Also a study by the Harvard Business Review found women did not want more<b>  senior</b> roles due to the extra stress and responsibility. In my last job the onl<b> y woma</b>n there liked to finish around 3.30pm as she had family commitments whereas I wouldn't leave until 6.30 to 7 and later at busy times. In mo<b> re seni</b>or positions you are expected to work more hours and more hours leads to more responsibility. That just suits men better than women as the majority of men are driven by their work life and not their home life. It is unlikely this will ever change as it is part of our personalities and just one of the things which makes men different from women and there isn't anything wrong with that. One of my friends as he earned less than his partner initially agreed to take time off to mind the baby but after a few weeks she was missing the baby and he went back to work and they cut down and managed and did the same when the second baby was born. The majority of Women have a bond with their children that the majority of men just do not have. He could not wait to get back to work whereas she struggled with the idea of being away from her children. I expect more from The Economist. Even More or Less shot down this earnings gap saying when you adjust for role taken, seniority, qualifications it just wasn't there. Market forces determine salaries and external childcare in society is viewed as less important than being Sergio Aguero or Bill Gates. That is because those industries whether through high margins in technology or gate and tv appearance receipts in Football there is a lot more money flowing around than in social work and men tend to work in higher valued fields and women in lower paid industries often with more security such as state funded positions. This is down to choice. Nearly always in engineering roles the candidates are 3 men. Why? Engineering is male dominated. Turn this around apply for a HR position and the candidates will likely be 3 women. This proves like it or not there are male and female positions.",

If they are getting paid less because they don't do the job the signed up doing, that's completely fair.

Sorry if that's a bit rude of me, but it just makes it harder for me to read your unreasoned comebacks. Earlier, Phil was actually saying that the point you were trying to make is perfectly reasonable in some circumstances. They were just adding to why many women would have said no. You are failing to see the other side of this argument supported by reasoned facts that can indeed be supported. I'm sorry that I am replying 3 weeks after the comment was made, but I felt that it should have been done. To be honest, it was a complete waste of my time to try to make someone that won't even hear out someone's well-stated argument understand. Now go back to school and learn how to type.

Thus, I reach the conclusion that you have never had a period.

To add to the born weaker article, that just means that women have to work harder to be on the same scale of men.

I'm sure it's more than the number you found. \n2.) The ratio doesn't matter, and you're putting words in my mouth. I said the women who are already in those fields, do their own heavy lifting, not that we do the majority of it. When we're given a job, we do it. THAT is what I was saying. Men are the ones insisting on doing it for us, sometimes aggressively. \n3.) I told you I have proof, but you ignored me and the other point I made in favor of irrationally inflating men's abilities and calling women inferior. \n4.) YOUR BODIES are NOT superior Women have better endurance, more agility, we handle the heat better, have better balance. All very important in construction depending on your occupation. You're also comparing the best men have to offer to the rest of us. How is that fair? Even if IQ was a good way to measure intelligence, pretty sure Stephen Hawking said it. \"Those who boast about their IQ are losers.\" Men are not more intelligent than women in general. Come back to Earth. \n5.) The kind of work I do is residential repairs. Sometimes commercial, and I, nor anyone I've ever worked with, was required to lift over 100 pounds. Which, if you remember that women are ALSO able to build muscle the more they work, and that the average American <b> woman </b>can lift at least 80, isn't a problem. I also feel like you think men, in jobs that DO require a lot of strength (because knowledge is more important in most occupations)  are lugging around 200 pounds all by themselves, without the help of other people or machines.

            "commentText": "The vid does not make reference to the extra money men earn when they work while women have children is spent on their families, that is the children that the women stop working to have. Or is it the norm that women have & raise children on their own? While that happens the overwhelming majority have 2 parents who decide for themselves how to prioritise earnings and childcare. This usually results in men working, and trying to maximise their careers or overtime to best support their family responsibilities and women focusing on maintaining a good home environment. I know couples where they do the opposite or do both at different times. I'm also told that childcare, without tax relief in the uk, often costs more that can be earned after tax by mother returning to work. There are mothers who do this anyway as they wish to be active but choosing to stay  at home is a reasonable option. Much will come down to personal circumstances of the people involved and their priorities. The repeated portrayal of relationships between men and females particularly involving children as competitive rather than complementary is distorting. Broadly speaking , women leave the workforce to bear and probably raise children; men stay in work and work hard to earn more money to spend on their families. Variations on this can and do occur by the couple managing their lives as they see fit. The other portrayal as women as too timid to ask for a pay rise or assert themselves in meetings is <b> nothing </b>like my experience. \nA good colleague is someone who helps get the job done, make or female. An overly assertive or timid colleague is usually a liability, male or female. Also, if women are pursuing careers as the men are, then they will compete for the promotions available. If more men are at work it seems probable that more men will be promoted. But suitability for any particular role is more down to individual ability and fit for that role.",

            "commentText": "Some may argue that women are naturally attracted to jobs like nurses, teachers etc due to a difference in brain makeup, often women, and this is a broad stereotype, are more attracted teaching jobs because it is a safe and enjoyable profession whereas men are more impulsive and prefer high risk or exciting jobs (stockbroker, business exec) where many things can go wrong, this is also why you see more men with gambling addictions. There is a difference in the genetic makeup of men and women and although this is changing the women who want the same jobs have slightly different brain functions and think all women want the same as them. Obviously, some men don't trust women to work in an important position inside their business due to how society has programmed us to view women but many women are happy with the job they do but they just want a higher pay for it. The problem is not just with men!",

I commend & applaud her because she's worked so hard to get where she is today and her supervisor gave her an immense pay raise (my boss also gave me a huge pay raise as well).  She deserves it. We're not jealous of each other at all since both of our salaries are very equal (our expenses are first priority, then the fun stuff comes later lol).

When female workers begin to dominate a profession, modern day western societies tend to devalue these profession. For instance when women took over nursing in the second half of the 20st century, salaries dropped drastically in comparison to the time when it was male-dominated. This happens with nearly all professions dominated by women, look at the cuts in payment for teachers(dominated by women). Opponents to feminism argue that it is women who choose other jobs, but it is society who devalues the work hard-working women do",

That would not only be the best for both women and society but the sanest way to live. Like it or hate it the cause of so much misery among the working classes is that women were tricked into pursuing a career which is the politically correct term for: forced to become corporate slaves. However much you will continue to fight this simple and most basic truth, the world will return to it sooner or later, because that is how nature intended it to be. Men are the bread winners of the family and women the carers: in that role BOTH are equal, BOTH are important, BOTH are necessary and if the state fails to treat them equal (not the same, but equal) when they assume such roles then take it from me that that state has an agenda which is far from doing what's best for society and its citizens. I believe in this and am telling this because of one thing: I want people to have a life that they will find significant. I'm backed up by evidence which is very hard to find, as if it is a secret. It seems that one way or another it is necessary that women be corporate slaves otherwise there are some 'elite' whose unsatisfied lust for more cannot be quenched. This lie was sold to women wrapped up in the lie of equal rights just like in the 20's women were sold the lie that if they wanted respect from men than they must smoke cigarettes like them, whereas it was only a marketing ploy enacted because cigarette companies (Philip Morris) feared a drop in profits. That's how much you and I count in this capitalist world of ours. Stop fighting the wrong enemy and start to take your lives back.",

Because the jobs american culture traditionally has placed on women are far fewer in number than jobs that are traditionally placed on men. Thus, there is going to be way more supply than demand for those jobs, and that leads to lower wages for those jobs.\n\nI come to this conclusion because this is not a consistent wage gap world wide and it varies differently from country to country, thus it must be culture rather than some glo<b> bal patriar</b>chy.\n\nIt is<b>  not se</b>xism but merely its specter, something that will be eroded away with time as more and more women break out into non traditional career paths.

There's a reason money was created.\n2. With introduction of patents, scientific discovery grew exponentially. That's because scientists and inventors were finally getting paid more for their jobs. If we pay good scientists more we will get much better results than we currently get.\n3. Lawyers earn little if they don't graduate from top law schools. Not so in case of <b> doctors.</b> That's why many people study medicine instead of law.\n4. I never said teachers were unimportant. They are important, but less than<b>  doctors</b>.

If I'm getting this right, you're saying that the average <b> woman </b>gets more meaning from giving birth to a child after 9 1/2 months than the average man gets from that birth. Because of that, it is more likely for women to prefer the newfound meaning of caring for their young child than the pursuit of their career. \n\nI'm not entirely familiar with the statistics, but what if women who don't get the average amount of meaning from childbirth DO wish to re-enter the workforce and face lower wages, cut hours, etc? Is it a case where you just can't get the best of both worlds? I think that's where my main concern lies. \n\nFrom the last bit about fathers, I think I get what you mean. If they're not already, they have to mature and start working really hard and long hours to provide for their young family instead of hanging out with the guys all the time.",

There are people, who happen to be of female <b> gender.</b> Typically males do have a problem with it, which is why they hate when women make more money they do (in fact if it wasn't for<b>  gender</b> pay gap, imposed by males, women would be making more money than males all the time) ). That's what it boils down to,  people of femal<b> e gende</b>r, smarter than males, who make more money than males, make males feel threatened, so the males hoof and puff and u<b> se sexu</b>al harassment to keep them at bay. In the end they all deflate into nothingness ... watch Trump.\nTwo: leftists are not a thing, just people who use objective reasoning and facts to make arguments, Again males, that is insecure men, tend to hate facts and replace that with \"shit\" using power to impose this shit onto others (See Trump). \nThree; let women say what they like, your opinion, given you have no clue wha<b> t a wo</b>man is, is worth shit.\nFour: Family is fine, but it is not for you to decide what women should or should not think or prefer or like,which is what you cannot stand, the fact more and more women of all ages, just fuck do what they want, cause they can afford it and do not need to suck your dick. In fact, that's what the pay gap<b>  and se</b>xual harassment is all about, try keeping women from exercising their freedom to be smarter and make more  money than any emotionally weak and insecure male (you being one nice example, another .. Trump, who is triggered every time someone says his ass look big).\n\nFinally: get a hint... you are males, not men.",

I'd rather spend my life working on things that I will forever find more fullfilling, namely learning and maybe working with animals (I'm really looking forward to working in animal shelters). I believe it's what folks call being childfree now? The most I'm looking forward to in regards to a family of my own is an eventual partner, really. Though that sounds pretty iffy aswell in a way.\n\nIf anything, children are more threatening than ever now specially with overpopulation and enviromental issues getting worse and worse. I personally would abstain (if I REALLY wanted kids) from having them just because of the threat of climate change and pollution making the planet worse than it is in only a few decades from now (IIRC, scientists predicted if some changes weren't made now an irreversible situation would come by 2030). Who knows, if this is not the case and I've settled with a proper career and wonderful lady adoption might come into question. Doubt.",

However, I do agree that<b>  sexual</b> harassment is male response to insecurity about women progressing in jobs that they used to monopolise, but   a lot of men are now in support of equality in job opportunities including me.

These are not the individuals I am referring to as males (as opposed to men). \nI am not sure what made you think that I suggested that all women are smarter , just because of their<b>  gender</b>. However, I said and will say it again, an<b> y woma</b>n is smarter than a male, which (grammar error intended) in my vocabulary don't qualify as worth dealing with. You know, the usual idiots.. the kind of retards, who actually think the size of their dick mattersv...that kind of moron. Oh, there are plenty of such retards.\nAnyway,... yes, pretty much women and men are equally smart. Not males though, ... they are literally stupid.\nOh, ... Little fact to chew on,...at comparatively similar upbringing, women typically score higher IQ, exactly because they are still generally and systematically requested a higher standard of performance for similar recognition of merits. That's true since kindergarten...so in the end they score by better, if they are given a plain field, exactly because they are used to the unfair treatment. Ironically, the privilege stupid males have enjoyed, it's the very reason they are being outclassed.\nGuess what? I ,as a man, love it.\nWorking with women is a lot more fun and productive... Most of the time anyway, exactly because they typically had to be smarter than anyone around them, to get where they are. Males buddies instead more often than not suck each other up and so they end up lowering their own score bar. These are the ones ,who are worried about women and complain about them. These are the one running out of jobs ... and I say...So be it!",

The real reason women get paid less\u00a0is because women tend to study fields in university such as social work, psychology, sociology, while men on the other hand study engineering, computer science, physics, etc, which at the end of the day\u00a0are higher paying careers. Google, Microsoft,<b>  Apple</b>, Facebook are all constantly getting sued for not hiring 50-50 men and women but that is just not right. More men choose stem as their careers and more women choose social studies as their careers. We are not arguing that mos<b> t doctor</b>s are women why should we argue that mo<b> st enginee</b>rs at Facebook are men. This of course translates into the so call<b> ed \"gen</b>der gap\" which is basically in\u00a0dumbed down terms, men in engineering getting compared to women in social work. Of course if you group them together and find the average, on average men get paid 15% m<b> ore. No</b>body is forcing women to study careers that are paid less, they chose it and then they complain.<b>  I (a </b>woman) study mathematics and statistics and most of the people in my classes are guys. While we are hitting the books and killing ourselves over calculus, the majority female classes that are social geography, social justice, sociology, etc are out partying during exam week, and now they are demanding they get paid as much as the average men. This is some twisted reality we live in.",

What I meant to say is its very unlikely for us to get caught when compared to corporations.\u00a0There are also different levels of law.\u00a0Unequal pay is pretty up there but pot smoking is considered \"petty law\" and isn't as strictly regulated. Secondly, pay is not discussed among coworkers but it is recorded on spread sheets and employee charts for anyone in management, the union, the board, and government regulators to see. There are many men and women employed in these fields who look over these\u00a0charts on a daily basis\u00a0that would not stand for unequal pay. If a company paid 2 employees different wages for the same job, we would know about it really quickly. And last, please address me as a dignified human being and dont resort to calling people <b> dumb </b>on the internet simply because they dont agree with you.",

Secondary income earners are not really concerned about how much they earn as they already have a steady and better income flow from another partner in the household.

It's a noble cause I believe we should fight for.\n\nLower financial options? What does that even mean? Again, choices to leave the workforce and have children and raise families is a thing that many many women do. Hell, some don't even enter the workforce and choose to be stay at home moms and that's fine. It's a big risk for them, however since they don't have skills to be utilized in the workforce if for some reason their marriage and family doesn't work out.\n\nThese are choices women make and I think you'd probably agree with me that many many women understand the risks of being stay at home moms with no skills\n\nHow can we expect to have a free society if we're always trying to prop people up and artificially support them even if the choices they freely made had inherent risk in an ever-growing and evolving society that values education and skills that make the country and world better?\n\nThis isn't to say that being a stay at home mom isn't admirable. Quite the opposite. We should be praising these moms for dedicating their lives to raising a healthy, functioning family unit. \n\nBut single moms are a different story and this is much more complex topic. Single motherhood and having kids outside of marriage creates a real strain on the rest of society. Not only that, it puts the Mom and the child(ren) at a marked disadvantage",

But you are failing to see that many women make a lot of money too. That is the side of the argument you are missing. And about risks, I can really see that risk you took there when you first posted this comment. You really thought no one was going to reply to this? You also made it so much harder for me to argue about it since I can barely read it based on the lack of punctuation. You also failed to understand that many females are teachers. It is made clear that a lot of females are school teachers. They knew they weren't going to get paid a lot. They took the risk anyway. I also took the risk of getting proved wrong. And if you can't tell, I am female. Yet, I was capable of understanding and taking risks.",

While the draft has been eliminated in the United States, thanks to the work of Milton Friedman, there is technically still a registry in the event the government ever decided that it's important to sacrifice the lives of a few hundred thousand young men.\n\nWomen in America enjoy the privilege of being able to exercise their constitutional rights without also have to be obligated to die in defense of those rights.Feminists claim that women do not have 'equal rights', yet continue to advocate for 'special rights' without seeing the hypocrisy. Women have currently are entitled to three legal options to absolve themselves from their children, morally and financially. that they do not wish to take responsibility for. \n\n1. Women may abort the child before it is born\n\n2. Women may put the child up for adoption (without having to notify or identify the father)\n\n3. <b> Woman </b>may leave the infant, in accordance to Safe Haven law to be wards of the state and walk away.When fighting for legal custody today, many states the law will still assume that one parent is a 'primary caregiver' and one 'tertiary caregiver'. Typically the primary caregiver is a<b>  woman</b>. There is such a thing as 'shared custody', however it requires that the tertiary caregiver sue to prove themselves worthy of equal parenting, which is difficult and costly.\n\nAdditionally, the legal presumption of shared parenting upon divorce \u2013 that children have a legal right to an equal relationship with both their mother and their father following relationship breakdown \u2013 is strongly resisted by the National Organization for Women (NOW) and other feminist organizations who know that women will almost always win custody of children under the default laws.\n\nIn fact, men who can afford to purse legal remedies and challenge primary custody stand a very good chance of winning. So, while the law does not specifically indicate that custody will be awarded to women, the defacto result of primary/tertiary caregiver custody law is that women have a legal right to be assumed caregivers for children. Men do not.Men are generally not eligible to receive aid from domestic violence shelters. There are no court advocacy programs for male victims of domestic violence, and men and their children are not eligible for state and federal money for housing like women are if they are abused. As of now, there is only one shelter for male victims of domestic violence, the Valley Oasis Shelter. Women have approximately 1,800. Own a small business? If you're <b> a woma</b>n you can get significant benefits from the government. There are multitudes of resources available to women that are not available to men, such as loans and tax breaks. There's even free grant money available with direct appropriations coming out of the taxpayer's wallet in order to give women a leg-up in starting a businesses.\n\nThe Small Business Administration aggressively regulates male-owned businesses that try to pass themselves off as female owned.\n\nFrom the SBA:If you are a male-owned business and you make your wife or anoth<b> er wom</b>an 51 percent owner of the stock in order to qualify for 8(a) benefits, you are spinning your wheels. The SBA auditor will know what you are doing: 51 percent ownership i<b> s a<b>  </b</b>>red flag. Similarly, if the auditor comes to your office and sees that the male's office is bigger than the female's, you are not going to be certified. You must be able to show that the business is managed and controlled on a daily basis<b>  by a </b>woman, and th<b> at the</b> woman is the person who makes the day-to-day decisions of the company.",

            "commentText": "There is a number of inaccuracies in this video, although it is not as terrible as I initially expected upon clicking on it. The notion that \"women are as ambitious as men\" is factually incorrect; in psychology, we know this not to be true. \n\nThe claim that, as more men choose differing career paths and focus more on paternity, more women will reach executive positions at companies is wrong, or at least has no evidence supporting it. The amount of executive roles at companies is relatively small and unlikely to be affected by a slight increase in variation of male occupations or time off from work. Further, men are never going to take as much time off from work as women do on average. We know that people who get into executive positions have certain temperamental and cognitive advantages that make their selection to these positions more likely, and these properties are, on average, more prevalent among men.\n\nFinally, the notion that women are being \"held back\" by the current societal structure is an unfounded claim. Also, the perverse notion that increased competition is somehow discriminating against women due to unequal outcomes is one that only a mentally-challenged person would think stands to reason. Our biological reality is such that, on average, men are more suited for competitive, high-stress environments, which explains their overall higher wages and more <b> senior </b>roles in society. However, one must not ignore the significant in-group variance within men and women, which is greater than the variance between said groups. In other words, any individual<b>  woman</b> can do anything she wants in life, including not having children and thus progressing further in her career, and making a ton of money. What you cannot do however, is a) choose to have a child in the middle of your career, and expect to be still as likely as the average person to get into <b> a senio</b>r position, and b) claim that unequal outcomes in life on aggregate are somehow indicative of systematic discrimination against a given group of people.",

This is a fact. And it's unfair that one half of population can have it all, and another cannot. So don't say  there's no inequality and a<b>  woman</b> can choose as well as a man can. This inequality is biological though, not because \"evil men\" elaborately decided it to be this way - women just drew this \"biological\" card, shit happens. But it's still inequality and we have to accept it as such. And after we accepted it for what it is - we can look for ways to solve this. And if a man is wise enough and <b> a woma</b>n is ambitious enough, they can sit down together and come up with a solution: who works how much, how they share responsibilites, hire a nanny etc. So the solution exists. Let's only not pretend women can have it all without cooperation from their partner's side - because biology tells a different story.",

You think that it's the mere result of having sired an offspring that then entails to having it all?\n\nNo it's not, a hell of a lot of fathers barely get to spend time with their family in the same way the mothers do. The fact that women in general even if it by the women's own desire the takes more time of and don't earn as much or even less than the <b> woman,</b> and even becomes the stay-at-home parent. Women even then find it the majority of the cases a huge loss in attraction for the man, and then it's all hell from there.\n\nAnd then especially so if the mothers don't want the father to be with his kids. At least in the western countries, and I can't imagine it's much different most places, the court system is literally rigged against the fathers to the to the point of training judges, lawyers, social workers to coach women into fucking over the men. And that is when you one doesn't take into account the laws system that are in place to even force judges to force women to not even being able to make an amicable result in custody. While women usually get a free lawyer by the factor that men usually are the ones footed the bill for the lawyer either way. \nWhile the men have to try to just get a hearing and getting into court and in just his legal fees can something like $20.000 or 17.000 Euros per year, and that is just to get it trough the system and<b>  nothing</b> is guaranteed.\n\nAnd I haven't even gone into details here.\n\nYeaa no, men don't have it all. And women can decide to plan their life better as well...... As so many like to say, \"My body my choice\", well \"Your life, your consequences of your choices.\"",

We are designed to feel sorry and cater to women and laugh at men that are facing hard times.

No one is forcing you. Instead find a <b> woman </b>who prefers to pay for her self. What essentially happens is that the economical ladder will start to vanish for the women if they are actively held back just because some don't pay for their meal when going out on a date which maybe happens once a year during a 5 year period tops. So what you get is women understandably starting to withdraw from the workforce and instead have their role at home which will bring a more conservative society and this in turn will put half of the population left being unused in terms of development and economical development. And the very ambitious women will move away to countries where they will have an equal opportunity. Your idea resembles of a conservative driven socialistic dictatorship. It's an interesting mix where the result will perhaps resemble that of ussr or perhaps modern day Poland but worse. Either way you and your idea is idiotic",

You are placing men and women into two separate groups (which they have been in society for a long time) but if you frame it as though you are looking at individual people, it makes more sense to demand equality. See historically men have done things and faced certain pressures and the same with women, the idea is to recognise that these pressures are artificial and not natural so when removing pressures for women to take lower paying jobs for example at the same time we want to remove the pressure on men that they have to be the highest earners. Its going to take a long time but essentially its about a societal change from thinking of men and women as two distinct groups to all individuals being people in their own right and having the freedom to follow their ambitions without any societal handicap because of their gender",

So in a job where males earn $50hr, the average female coworker is paid $4 less per hour, $160 less per week and $8,320 less per year. Maybe YOU'RE privileged enough to not give a shit, but over a lifetime that adds up. In 50 years that's $416k. That's not pocket change dipshit! LEARN THE WAGE GAP. The wage gap and the earnings gap are not the same thing.\nThe male wage premium needs to be abolished until men can prove why they deserve a premium. We also need to reduce wage inequality between the sexes by reducing occupational segregation and getting women in higher paying positions.",

Females tend to obey school system far smoother than males, that's why they get higher grades in subjects that need no critical thinking and creativity. Memorize, memorize, memorize, don't need to analyze the fact just shove the information in my brain. That's how female students get high scores. But when tests get tougher and requires far more logic and application of information, female students panic while male students get pumped up with competitiveness. That's where the REAL difference kicks in. And that's why physics and mathematics are male dominant fields, because they need much more than just memorizing what you learned. You need critical thinking ability. And unfortunately these pathetic western school ststems never want students to make subjects more challenging. They only teach washed-down, incredibly easy informations that demands literally NO challenges. That's why you believe women are smarter and deserves the dominance. But, no, sorry kiddo, grades you get for obeying everything teachers say and sitting your ass off all fay to memorize the information to achieve high scores means jack shit.",

I am not sure you are understanding, you don't get to lead a $1T dollar asset company before 40, unless your brain is functioning better than anyone else.\nYou pull the \"exception\" shit,  but by doing so, you contradict yourself ...there is no such thing as an outlier for an normal distribution ... and no, IQ distribution is the same for males and females .. so you are making up shit once again.\nHere is the reality<b> : Gende</b>r has been used for a very long time to stop women from  earning the right to leading.

They only want their so called \"equality(as fake as their understanding of it is)\" when it's a suitable job in their own view. C'mon little feminists(I know I'm mansplaining now) see if you can follow. Say there are 100 jobs available with 50 male and 50 female workers available, 50 of the jobs are oilfield jobs paying \u00a350/hr and the other 50 are desk jobs paying \u00a320/hr. both men and women can choose which jobs they want. 40 of the 50 men choose the oilfield and 10 of the women choose it as well, 10 of the men choose the desk job and 40 women choose the same. The average then for the men will be higher and the average for the women will be lower because of their choices of work. It has<b>  nothing</b> to do with unfair practice.

Even the handful of women who major in real majors like medicine & become<b>  doctors</b> or they become attorneys, most of even those women quickly drop out of the workplace in just a few years, so it's all just a big joke.\n\nI mean, to me it kind of defeats the object of womens lib if someone says 'hey Im independent, I earn my own money etc' and then gives it all up to spend someone elses money\n\nYeeea, about that whole 'women's lib' thing, that was all a bunch of bullshit, everything that feminism tells women is 100% fraud & lies. The reason women have never invented anything of significance, never built anything & contribute next t<b> o nothin</b>g in society is not because men are 'oppressing' them, it's because women simply are not that intelligent & extremely lazy. I know that's harsh, but accepting the truth is a lot better than walking around with a chip on your shoulder. \n\nWhy is it so hard to just accept men are superior both mentally & physically? I'm a white male & don't spend all my time stewing about the fact th<b> at bla</b>ck men are far better athletes on average. That's just how we're born. \n\nThe evidence is all around you. Everything invented, built & maintained by men & all of it re-invented & improved by men daily, we even invented all of the areas of study themselves & after 50 years of feminism women have achie<b> ved noth</b>ing. A lot has been done FOR women, but women themsel<b> ves, not</b>hing.\n\nNot to even mention most women want to go back to being housewives:\n84% of Women Want To Go Back To Being Housewives:\n [LINK]  \n\nWhat more proof do you even need that feminism failed miserably & was a complete waste of time & now it's time for women to get back in the kitchen? Especially when that's exactly where most women want to be.",

Sometimes its just lack of confidence because they feel shit about themselves. cant think why!\n\nThat's not how it works, Goofy. Millions of men have been told they were 'stupid' & only took it as a challenge & went on to succeed in life. If you're so weak & spineless that being told you're stupid or insulted in any way is going to make you curl up in a ball & not even try, then you're too weak for the real world anyway, which puts us right back at square one: Women are not suited for the workplace & belong in the home & want to be there. I've never seen evidence of much intelligence in women in my entire life.\n\nI think women have contributed an a lot to society and are actually behind a lot of discoveries and inventions\n\nYou've got to be joking. Women have only invented a handful of things like liquid paper & a couple of other trivial things & half of so called female inventors are complete frauds. The sum total of female inventors looks like an ant next to a skyscraper in comparison to what men achieve in just one day. You don't have any corresponding intelligence to the world in which you live. Men do everything.\n\nbut we shouldnt tar all of them with the same brush, as I also return the favour of not tarring all men with the brush of being 'sexist pigs' -which is more than you would get from some, especially given the above comments\n\nThe night & day difference is men are held accountable in western society while men are not. In western society women are above reproach & even virtually above the law- imagine if MEN were above reproach, unaccountable & above the law, what would we BE like? We would be horrific pieces of shit like most women in the west today. \n\nSimple. It's called being a spoiled, unaccountable<b>  brat</b> & women need to be raked back in for their own good as well because western women have gone WAAAAY downhill & have turned into useless feeder trash whores.",

I have NO IDEA why people only consider academic qualifications when on the subject of the <b> gender </b>pay gap. Men in skilled blue collar work are just as talented as someone with a degree and often a lot more useful to employers.\n\n\nIn countries like Germany, completing an apprentiship is considered the same as getting a degree. They're even allowed to use the abbreviation of \"craftsman\" or \"Master craftsman\" just like \"PhD\" of \"MsC\". It's the overall respect for technical skills in Germany that has made them so prosperous.",

For a masters, it's business admin for both men and women. For doctorates it was engineering, chemistry and physics for men and for women, educational leadership and administration, chemistry, and I thiiinnkkkk Biology. Again, hardly useless. Contrary to popular, anti feminist belief, women aren't majoring in <b> gender </b>studies and liberal arts. That's pretty rare and I don't think even on the list for most popular degrees. Even social work is at like 2%.",
