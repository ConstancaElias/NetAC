        "postText": "'The crushing statement came in a book-long interview titled 'Without Him We Can Do Nothing' in which the Pope opens up about his faith and outlook as the head of the Catholic Church in talks with Italian journalist Gianni Valente. He said: There are circles and sectors that present themselves as enlightened and even(seize) the proclamation of the Gospel through their distorted reasoning that divides the world between civilized and barbaric.', 'They consider a large part of the human family as if they were a lower - class entity, unable to achieve decent levels in spiritual and intellectual life according to their standards.', 'On this basis, contempt can develop for people considered to be second rate.', 'Christianity will also reflect the different faces of the cultures and peoples in which it is received and takes root.', 'The comments, which appear to be accusing certain people in the Catholic community of discrimination, came after he embarked on his Amazon synod, announcing that married men in the region will be permitted to become priests.', 'Pope Francis also referred to an Argentine slang term \u2013 cabecitas negras \u2013 which translates to little black heads and is used as a derogatory slur towards black people.', 'The Pope condemned the sarcastic words and also criticised alleged slurs levelled at indigenous people wearing feathers a the Amazon synod.', 'He added: Tell me: What\u2019s the difference between having feathers on your head and the three-peaked hat [birettas] worn by certain officials in our dicasteries?', 'The Pope's progressive approach has seen a wholesale change in the Catholic Church.' , 'The Pope has already appointed cardinals from less notorious churches spanning further across the globe. Recently, cardinals from less established countries such as Morocco, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Lithuania were appointed.', 'This policy will likely lead to his replacement holding similar values when he departs from the role.', 'His critics have grown impatient with this policy, including Francis predecessor Benedict XVI, who remained domiciled in an apartment on Vatican grounds.', 'He also faces opposition from outside the Church, as Italian politician Matteo Salvini remains staunchly opposed to his tenure. ', ' The two share very different views on immigration, with Pope Francis being far more open to refugees while Salvini has taken a hardline, anti - immigration stance. ', 'In May 2016, Salvini tweeted: The Pope says migrants are not a danger.Whatever!', 'He was also pictured in 2016 holding a shirt saying Benedict is my Pope'.",

The Amazonian element was there to scandalise and divert attention with their pagan rituals in the Vatican Garden, Our Lady of Transportina Church and even in St. Peters, to name just the main events.  Totally outrageous and certainly NOT what any priest should allow into the Church, let alone a Pope! Meanwhile, behind the scenes there was much being done to pave the way to annex the Catholic Church to the U.N.so that it will speedily become the Globalist One World Church. You bet we 're fighting this......",
