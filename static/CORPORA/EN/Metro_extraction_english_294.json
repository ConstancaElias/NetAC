        "postText": "A woman left a nightclub in tears after a group of men surrounded and mocked her for kissing her girlfriend on the dance floor.', 'A hate crime complaint has been made following Lowri Jones\u2019s \u2018intimidating and scary\u2019 experience at the Fever & Boutique in Plymouth, on Friday.', 'The 23-year-old said: \u2018It\u2019s just shocking. To be singled out like that, because we are a same sex couple.\u2019', 'Lowri told of her \u2018horrible\u2019 experience: \u2018My girlfriend came to kiss me \u2013 my back was turned to the wall, and I could see it, there were three or four men \u2013 they were really drunk and pretty intimidating.', '\u2018They started walking towards us, they found us and started shouting \u201cWahey, wahey, lesbians, wahey\u201d.', '\u2018Because the wall was behind me, we were surrounded. It was just really intimidating and scary.\u2019', 'She added: \u2018We were singled out in a space where we couldn\u2019t challenge them.', '\u2018It was a really horrible feeling, we didn\u2019t know who these people where and why they were doing it.\u2019', 'She said her girlfriend turned to one of them and said: \u2018What are you doing?\u2019, when one of the men spilled a drink on her.', 'Lowri continued: \u2018I don\u2019t think he meant to. They were so drunk \u2013 I don\u2019t think they knew what they were doing.', '\u2018I got upset and walked away,\u2019 and the couple decided to call it a night.', 'CCTV is being studied and clubbers have been urged to come forward.', 'Staff at the club, Fever & Boutique, in Plymouth, are trying to identify the man and say they will work with other venues to ensure they are refused entry in future.', 'Homophobia is alive and well in Plymouth tonight. Left Fever in tears with my girlfriend after being surrounded by men shouting at us when we kissed. Beyond ridiculous that this bullshit happens in 2018.', '\u2014 Lowri Jones (@lowrihj) June 15, 2018', '', 'Lowri says they don\u2019t blame the nightclub for what happened, praising a member of staff in the cloakroom and the general manager for being supportive.', 'But she is shocked that people still lurk about in today\u2019s society with issues towards gay people.', 'Lowri, who\u2019s president of the University of Plymouth Students\u2019 Union, said: \u2018It\u2019s really scary, that there\u2019s still that stigma and that we can\u2019t just be comfortable and be ourselves.', '\u2018It just ruined the night \u2013 it was a really horrible experience.\u2019', 'Duty manager at the club, Pete Chevin, said: \u2018We take any hate crime very serious and we spoke to Lowri Jones last night about it. We are trying to identify the suspects responsible.', '\u2018If we can do, we will bring on board police and licensing and make Pubwatch aware so they don\u2019t allow these persons back in Plymouth\u2019s licensed venues.', '\u2018It\u2019s a case of going back through CCTV and clarifying things from there and see if there any potential witnesses.', '\u2018If anyone has information then we are more than happy to work with them.\u2019",

Yes it must've been a horrible experience but as she said herself they were too drunk to know what they were doing, 'wahey, lesbian' hardly means they hated her. Yes, they were wrong but don't think they need the police to call and maybe risk their jobs, they may have young families to support and in the cold light of day they were probably ashamed of themselves (if they remembered).",

I wonder that there\u2019s a generation growing up that genuinely think that things like this is <b> homophobia.</b> I also worry that the tide is going to turn massively and that genuine<b>  homophobic</b> acts are going to get eye rolls and shrugs because people are sick of hearing about it.",
