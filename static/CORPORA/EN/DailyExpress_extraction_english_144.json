        "postText": "The four migrants, believed to be from Somalia, were part of a larger caravan of 16 smuggled into Britain from Italy, according to The Sun. The newspaper reported they began to feel unwell after police found them inside the back of the vehicle on an industrial estate.', 'A source told The Sun test results were pending following their discovery in Biggleswade, just north of Letchworth Garden City.', 'They have since been \u201cisolated\u201d in a block of council-owned flats in Bedford.', 'The remaining 12 migrants are being dealt with by immigration officials, it is understood.', 'Kempston Police Station, where all 16 were held, was closed and deep cleaned to ensure any potential spread of the virus was curtailed.', 'A separate group of immigrants smuggled into the country were discovered inside a container at King George Dock in Hull.', 'Police would not confirm if any of these had yet been tested.', 'Meanwhile, cases in the UK took a sharp rise as 12 new confirmed cases were announced.', 'It took the total to 51.', 'Eight of the new patients had recently travelled from Italy.', 'Fresh cases also included the first to have traveled from Germany.', 'The other had been to Singapore, Japan and Iran, this suggesting none are believed to have contracted the virus in the UK.', 'Health officials in the Canary Islands reported the first case of a British national testing positive at a quarantined hotel in Tenerife.', 'The surge in cases constitutes the second highest single-day increase in cases to date.', 'Among these, the first known cases now include Hampshire, Humberside and Northamptonshire.', 'Others are from London, Wirral, Greater Manchester ad Kent.', 'Dr Will Welfare, a representative of Public Health England North West, said there were now three new COVID-19 cases in Greater Manchester.', 'This included two from Bury.', 'He said: \u201cAs a result of contact tracing we know the new Bury cases announced today are known contacts of the previously confirmed case from Bury.', '\u201cThe third case is a resident of Bolton which is not linked to the two cases in Bury announced today. The Bolton resident became infected whilst in Italy.', '\u201cClose contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases.', '\u201cThis tried and tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public.\u201d', 'The previous case from Bury was said to have been contracted while the host was in Italy.', 'Public Health England has said that all the new cases in the UK were contracted abroad, leading many to speculate that the two latest cases form Bury were too likely to have been contracted in Italy.",

Many of these illegal entrants have paid to be smuggled and own smartphones to contact others behind them to a confirm successful route to UK entry.  They are utterly determined, not daft.  When it comes to illegal entry, it's a pity our politicians rather more daft than determined.",
