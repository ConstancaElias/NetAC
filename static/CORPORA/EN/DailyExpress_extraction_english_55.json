        "postText": "The Green MP has proposed that 10 high-profile female politicians should form a cabinet of national unity to block a no deal Brexit and seek legislation for a fresh referendum. The extraordinary proposal has been met with overwhelming criticism, as many branded the suggestion as \u201cblatant sexism\u201d. Others have criticised the cabinet for excluding women of colour, as all 10 of the MPs put forward are white.', 'Ms Lucas has asked a handful of female MPs to join her, including Labour\u2019s Emily Thornberry, the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, and SNP\u2019s leader Nicola Sturgeon.', 'Writing in the Guardian, the Green MP said: \u201cWe need an \u2018emergency Cabinet\u2019 \u2013 not to fight a Brexit war but to work for reconciliation.', '\u201cAnd I believe this should be a Cabinet of women.\u201d', 'She went on to say any Cabinet could not include male members as in the past it was women who had shown they can bring an alternative approach to crises like the ongoing Brexit situation.', 'Ms Lucas said: \u201cI believe women have shown they can bring a different perspective to crises, are able to reach out to those they disagree with and cooperate to find solutions.\u201d', 'But the proposal has been heavily criticised on Twitter, with one user writing: \u201cIs this really what our politicians should be doing?', '\u201cComing up with self indulgent and now sexist suggestions to subvert the democratic process?\u201d', 'Another said: \u201cI have a lot of time for Caroline but this is nonsense.\u201d', 'A third wrote: \u201cCaroline Lucas is launching a ludicrous Parliamentary coup which has no justification whatsoever.', '\u201cOn what basis can she claim that her all female, all remain voting Government would of National Unity?', '\u201cThe woman is clearly mad, as well as deluded.\u201d', 'Others have called for Ms Lucas\u2019 resignation: \u201cCan we call on Caroline Lucas to resign for blatant sexism?', '\u201cShe\u2019s just stereotyped a whole gender and then excluded another based on their gender.', '\u201cThis is not how MPs should act.\u201d', 'Another simply asked: \u201cWhy exclude a political based on there sex?\u201d', 'Politicians have also joined in on the criticism, with Tory MP Liz Truss asking: \u201cIs there anything more sexist than claiming your gender determines your worldview/behaviour/attitude?\u201d', The Green MP has also come under fire for excluding women of colour from the proposed cabinet.', 'Labour MP Chi Onwurah said it was \u201cpatronising\u201d and added: \u201cIncluding BAME women is not going some extra mile!\u201d', 'Another person wrote: \u201cWhy no women of colour including the most senior woman in Labour Diane Abbott?\u201d', 'The women invited to join Ms Lucas in the emergency cabinet are: Heidi Allen, Kirsty Blackman, Yvette Cooper, Sylvia Hermon, Liz Saville Roberts, Anna Soubry, Emily Thornberry, Jo Swinson, Nicola Sturgeon, Justine Greening.', 'Ms Thornberry has responded on Twitter, and said: \u201cI will gladly stand on a stage with you and the other women\u201d but said she was worried the new proposals \u201cwould not solve our country\u2019s divisions\u201d.', 'The other politicians are yet to publicly respond.",

As obvious examples both Tony Bliar and Con Major were recent male leaders who utterly sold out Britain to the unelected EU like the traitors they are, so that would rule out any future male and female leaders.  That leaves us with those 'new' genders the likes of Caroline Lucas might insist we must believe in or be beheaded for apostasy. We need patriots loyal to Britain to secure our<b>  Brexit</b> escape from the EU 's grasp regardless of any specifi<b> c gende</b>r.  Also Europe's disenfranchised people have their own potential saviours from both genders, with Marine Le Pen in France, Matteo Salvini in Italy, Geert Widers in the Netherlands, Frauke Petry in Germany, and so on. The enemy is the EU and its imported army of Islamic jihadists and third world chancers used to sow terror on a relatively peaceful continent in the twisted hope that Europe <b> 's nati</b>on state democracies would then agree to surrender their armies to full EU control to counter the threat the EU itself deliberately unleashed.  Pro-Western people of both genders need to stand united against t<b> his com</b>mon threat to our shared values.",
