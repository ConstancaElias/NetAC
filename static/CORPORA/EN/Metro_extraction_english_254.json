        "postText": "A student wants to remove the word \u2018faggot\u2019 from classic Christmas song Fairytale of New York because it\u2019s a \u2018homophobic slur\u2019.', 'Thomas Haynes wrote an article for student newspaper The Tab and said the lyric from the festive favourite was as \u2018bad as using the N-word\u2019.', 'The publication\u2019s assistant editor insisted people should stop singing the line \u2018you cheap lousy faggot\u2019 and there are a growing number of people who support his position.', 'Yesterday songwriter Shane McGowan said he didn\u2019t mind if the word was bleeped.', 'Justin Myers wrote on his page The Guyliner in November: \u2018I remember Christmas 1989, one of my very favourite school bullies striding down the aisle of the school bus shouting out that line, and timing the \u2018faggot\u2019 with a slap to the side of my head that made it bounce off the window.\u2019', 'Hayes echoed his calls and added that the line should be removed from YouTube because none of the Pogues or Kirsty McColl were gay.', 'He made his comments in an online article posted on Wednesday titled \u2018Dear straight people, stop singing the word \u201cfaggot\u201d in Fairytale of New York\u2019.', 'He also posted a link to a six-year-old video of Gary Barlow performing the song with Nicole Scherzinger, Tulisa and Dawn French, which he describes as \u2018reeking of pre-2012\u2019.', 'He writes: \u2018The scene of a packed crowd cheering on a straight woman for successfully uttering a homophobic slur is f**king bulls**t.', '\u2018The \u201cfaggot\u201d line is predictably censored on radio, but that won\u2019t stop straight people singing it at the top of their lungs when it comes on in the pub.', '\u2018Only when you take a step back does something seem off with that picture in 2018.\u2019', 'Haynes goes on to argue members of LGBT community listening to the song could be reminded of a time they were bullied.', 'He concludes by saying: \u2018This Christmas, give yourself the gift of not being an arsehole: When Fairytale of New York plays on your next night out, just don\u2019t sing one word of it.', '\u2018That\u2019s all \u2013 one word, two syllables. Not too much of a stretch, right?\u2019', 'Supporters of keeping in the controversial word claim songwriter Shane McGowan was referencing an old Irish slang word meaning a lazy person.', 'Others branded the Haynes as a \u2018condescending millennial snowflake\u2019 while one replied: \u2018I\u2019m gay and I sing it loud and proud.\u2019', 'Yesterday McGowan addressed the controversy and said he didn\u2019t want to get into an argument.', 'He didn\u2019t explicitly say what the word was meant to convey but added: \u2018The word was used by the character because it fitted with the way she would speak and with her character.', '\u2018She is not supposed to be a nice person, or even a wholesome person.', '\u2018She is a woman of a certain generation at a certain time in history and she is down on her luck and desperate.', '\u2018Her dialogue is as accurate as I could make it but she is not intended to offend.\u2019', 'He added: \u2018If people don\u2019t understand that I was trying to accurately portray the character as authentically as possible then I am absolutely fine with the bleeping the word but I don\u2019t want to get into an argument.\u2019",
