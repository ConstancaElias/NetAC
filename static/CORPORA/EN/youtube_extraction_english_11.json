            "commentText": "Feminism is the result of a pervasive inferiority complex by women who feel deeply their inadequacies in relation to men, hence project their Shadow/Id and blame the 'Other'. It is a resentment psychology typical of adolescents and is in keeping with the infantilization of modern women. All the talk of empowerment merely reveals the lack of it, truly empowered people (men and women) don't talk about themselves the whole time, they get on with things and try to work for the good of society without resorting to blame and shame. Feminism is self-absorption and solipsism all over, nurturing an acute grievance complex, feminists are never satisfied and will always complain about everybody else. It springs from a profound lack of psychic integration and is both a cause and effect of our civilizational degeneration. It is a modern conceit that feminism was invented in the late 19th Century, that is only the latest iteration, feminist movements were evident in Greece, Rome, Babylon and Persia (among others), and their appearance invariable lead to a civilizational collapse such as the one we are currently experiencing.",

To have a fair conclusion, you need a neutral, objective person with solid knowledge to give you a considerate, normal answer. This very well may be manipulation of media by showing a discussion of a subject with certain people who support it that will in return never say any negative opinion on it, and thats a problem. If my comment ever gets deleted it also easily can be an example of manipulation. Just because i stated the possibilty of this media right here sinking into corruption i may have endangered the existance of my comment. CBC, if you read this be more carefull.",

            "commentText": "Short answer, yes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first question is what the feminist movement is actually about. Why does everyone need to become \u2018feminist'? It is hard to\nsee what feminism actually stands for through all the noise and fuzz. In its radical form (and it appears that the movement is getting more and more radical), feminism rejects any \u2018male' value. This polarised form of debating will unfortunately not move the discussion forward. Second question is if the feminist movement should be seen as a means for a higher objective or as a goal as such. Unfortunately, the latter view seems to have won it from the first. The feminist movement has turned into a movement that embraces the call for \u2018more women' or \u2018more female values' as such, without even critically assessing why these\nwould be needed. \n\n\n\n\nEven the women that refer to feminism as a means to achieve higher societal needs seem to fail in conveying their ideas in\na nuanced way. \n\n\n\n\nFirstly, they refer to feminism as a matter of fairness: society needs more women because women used to be discriminated in\nthe past (and yes it is mostly a question of the past in Western societies as the \u2018pay gap' and other illustrations are way less striking if one dares to analyse the figures with intellectual honesty instead of a call for attention). Is it fair though to project the previous discrimination of women by the previous generation on the current generation of men (e.g. why do women need special\nexecutive training programmes in companies; why do companies need to hire more women, especially in overly politically correct institutions such as international organisations)?\n\n\n\n\nSecondly, women claim to justify feminism by reasons of accepting diversity. Creating a more diverse society is a valid\nreason to pursue, but does the current feminist movement stay true to this value? It rather seems that feminists put the fight for women's rights at a higher pedestal than other categories of diversity. Does the radical call for feminism imply that the fight for women is of a superior nature compared to for instance the fight for equal recognition of <b> black </b>males? In addition, any\nradical form of \u2018equality' paradoxically undermines diversity. Demanding that everyone becomes a feminist, neglects that men and women are fundamentally different and that their different traits deserve to be respected.\n\n\n\n\nIt is shameful and sad to see how many people try to surf on the hype of feminism simply because they see that any\nopinion in a newspaper on embracing feminism in a radical and overly politically correct fashion will immediately give them the attention they are desperately seeking for. With particular reference to the politicians of the European Commission, who recently voted in favour of a women to become the next president of the European Commission i.a. because she is a women (indeed not\nonly because she is a women but it was one of the criteria), I would like to say: what is the goal of the European Union for the next years? To solve the problem of its people or to become the worldwide centre of political correctness? This radical yet sad example only illustrates that politicians will follow any hype that gives them attention. By embracing any feminist initiative without even talking about substance, politicians curb the attention of the real problems people are dealing with such as less jobs, jobs taken over by robots, geopolitical tensions, trade wars etc. \n\n\n\n\nThe debate on feminism - or rather the lack of it - only shows the polarised world we are living in. Instead of depicting\nanyone who dares to challenge the feminist movement as anti-feminine per se, one would better focus all of its energy on coming up with the important debate on how men AND women can both contribute to creating a better world.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a more nuance view on the subject, also check:\n\n\n [LINK] ",

They knew men were going to walk away from the plantation 20 years ago - so they went around that (rather small) obstacle. Even as a MGTOW, I know my tax dollars go towards \"liberated\" women who's reproductive choices are society's problem. The family unit is destroyed, and we're on the move toward socialism and tribalism - systems which will lead to the ultimate downfall of Western civilization.",

However, I'll never turn my back on feminism. Yes it is a response to men. It would not have been needed if men hadn't stood on women's necks, pretending it's remotely acceptable to tell humans what they can and can't do, based on biological circumstance. Even that statement is too vague. It was to be born into slavery, being born a <b> woman.</b> If you smiled and accepted it, life was hospitable. If you sought after any form of identity or equality, life was hostile. Sometimes you were killed, ostracized, or rejected. You can be mad about feminists all you like, it won't change anything. The world isn't going back in time. That's actually why people like you are so angry. Feminism will eventually defeat toxic masculinity by standing on its very own neck, killing it, burying it, and disallowing it.",

Women for a majority of human history history have been oppressed. But there's society in history that have had women play major, or equal roles to men. For an example the country I come from South Sudan (cush in ancients times) had women for most of their history as leaders or queens. Actually the name kandace or Candace literally translates to queen. Most these queens were brilliant military tactitions and in all cases lead armies to war and even participated in battles. Most feminesms today truly believe that men see women as unequal and weak. History has shown most men will follow anyone with leadership qualities wether they be a man or a <b> woman.</b> Humans in general (men and women) won't follow some one or a group that's sees themself as a victim. Even today's feminist when it comes to achieving their goals or having laws passed in their favor ironically end up using men to achieve those goals.",

You would find it sexist if a man like I put a <b> woman </b>first IE.(opens the door for her, Allowed her to go first for whatever, or did physically demanding labor so she didn't have to.) All as sexist which is wrong. Men are typically larger(more mussel mass) so personally I volunteer to do labor women close to me are physically unable to do or don't want to do because of the effort required, women like you call me sexist when all I'm doing is helping. If a women feels the need or wants to do it more power to you. But your views are flawed from the start in that they are biased.",

Casual put down implying how tough women are in comparison to men.  Would a man ever get away with this?  \n\n9:56 Suprya \"Women don't want to be treated differently\"  You get 10 sick days. I get 10 sick days. Thats equal. Women get special extra days for womens problems. Thats DIFFERENTLY. \n\n10:19 \"I don't think men most men my <b> age </b>are that confused\". They probably are but part of PC culture makes it impossible to talk about this stuff. Just denying the problem when a Man is sitting right in front of you expressing himself honestly. There is a contradiction between \"I can do anything a man can do!\" and \"I need special purpose extra sick days\".",

However, I can't exactly blame them. If it makes their life easier, they're going to fight for it. HUMAN nature, on the other hand, psychologically speaking, says that women are viewed as prey and men as predators. We as a society are genetically programmed to protect women to continue our species--the reason being that one man can empregnate several women, so women are more valuable to keep the species going. So, basically, it is female nature to try to have special right. Im not saying that is good or bad, just that that is the way it is. In my opinion, this will be a struggle for both...basically forever, going back and forth. A true balance of power is likely never to occur until we, as a species, evolve into something ...well...diffierent, with the respect of human nature. I think at the very least with regard to our nature as seeing women as a greater value to the procreation of the species.",

We as men are watching and waiting until society is destroyed by feminism, they wanted equal pay and status in this world however this is a man's world. There is a real misunderstanding with who is in control, l don't see women in the working world that keeps the economy and society afloat. The truth is no matter how women push to be equal it will only happen when they start with getting their hands dirty shoveling ditches,climbing power poles to fix hydro lines, building cities, and all of the things that us men do to make our cities livable. With this push for feminism all that will happen is what the men are doing now, the people who think like a feminist don't have any idea of what we as men do. So l ask why is the sunday talk show asking has the movement going too far, is there a worry it is just starting for us men we had enough of the lies and the way society has lined up with the feminist movement, we are putting our foot down enough is enough. I am MGTOW and we are growing at an alarming rate, the fowl taste is all ready in our throats it will just continue like this. CHEERS HOPE IT ALL WORKS OUT FOR THE WOMEN WHO THINK LIKE THAT.",

The important differences that exist between men and women are being ignored. Women given choice would rather work less hours, have children and spend time raising those children. Feminists seek to remove this choice by insisting the women and men are equal and forcing women to take roles they normally would have avoided. When a feminist sees disparity in the workplace between men and women they believe it to be the cause of the evil <b> patriarchy </b>rather than for what it is women's choice.  Then they demand actions to be made to right the wrongs so that there is an equality of outcome. This takes the freedom of choice away from women and punishes men for something that had<b>  nothing</b> to do with them. Overall, feminism hurts everyone in this manner and it is my hope that people start embracing the idea that men and women are different and each have important roles to play in our society.",

Boys are already falling behind in school.  Do we have to keep this going for decades until all we have are men doing grunt work, While all the while women aren't accountable for their own actions and choices. \nWonder why more and more men are simply opting out and going the way of MGTOW.

Since Trudeau wants equality of outcome so much, why aren't women being drafted into our military, or being put in jobs in the waste management field? Why are the people that deal with the<b>  septic</b> tanks of my family members that have them almost always a man?\n\nI sincerely wish people would stop fighting for equality of outcome and start accepting equality of opportunity. If <b> a woma</b>n wants to work in my field (Instrumentation) they are more than welcome to, but they have to get the education to do so, and in the classes I took at the trade school I attended, there were 3 women in the two classes of 30+ students. \n\nAs for the concern of some women having it worse than others every month, I see it as a medical issue. Many people run into various medical issues in their lives, and you deal with them. I don't see why this particular issue should be treated any differently than any other medical issue? You don't see many people working on an offshore oil rig if they are confined to a wheelchair, why? Because the company realizes they would be unable or at least inefficient at the task and thus hire someone more appropriate for the position. How does this relate to additional days off? Well, the employer will see that worker #1 has to take more days off than worker #2, so I'll hire the second worker. \n\nThis point also makes th<b> e \"gend</b>er wage gap\" look kinda funny. If an employer could really pa<b> y a wo</b>man $0.77 for every $1 they pay a <b> man, no</b>body would hire men unless there was a performance reason to do so. So is the pay gap a myth or do men just work that much harder than women that companies decide to hire men too?",

And even when being enticed to, that guy didn't even have the guts to make any assertions about the questions asked. He was cowering from the get go!\n\nFeminism on its own is fine, but some Feminists have taken to beating us over the head with it to the point of nausea. The problem is the hard core feminists using it as a tool to advance their goals to the point of superiority over others. \n\nOne of the issues I see is the push for equal representation, which is no longer about equal opportunity or merit based appointment. This creates unfairness and bias which is exactly what Feminism should be avoiding!\n\nPeople need to remember that men and women are symbiotic rather than opposites. Both sexes have strengths and weaknesses and both compliment each other. The purpose of Feminism should be to keep men and women together, not create segregation and drive them apart.\n\nIf Feminists can avoid blaming men for perceived problems, keep the chip off their shoulders when they feel things are unfair, and show a little love and compassion along the way, I think everybody will be better off.",

Anyone interested in EQUALITY would not say that men would be less able to handle a period..If a man said something like that in reverse it would be sexist.. She is saying women are superior, not equal. This \"feminist\" does not represent equality. She is about taking control. If it were about equality, it would be humanism.  Modern feminism is a coup d'etat hiding in plain sight. The reason it has been able to get to this disgusting level is that these miserable individuals are willing to fight and fight becasue they are already miserable, so why not fight? Just fight endlessly for what they want, and those who know the evil hypocrisy of post -modern feminism stay silent-just easier that way-like the man who said <b> nothing.</b>",

If someone, due to a medical issue, requires significantly more time off than other staff, how do you account for that? \n\nWhat tends to happen is that person won't get a full time position, or they may get paid less (assuming they don't work to make up the time, they'll be working less)",

How is it equality?when they ignore fighting for the men's right.Men's right activist also have the same definition but they fight for the rights of men that is also not equality.Just because there's 'equality of sexes ' mentioned in the definition doesn't mean it is equality.Some of the feminists put down men by claiming that they're mansplaining,manspreading,etc.But all the feminsts would say that it is the radical feminists who do that.If u really want equality why don't u stop them?they are not treating the men as equals and they are also misleading the feminist movement .Never have I seen a single feminist stopping those radical feminists they tell us to ignore them why?do u think  it will  show that you are standing against feminism. NO!!!It will show that u are standing for equality .If u all stop them then everybody will understand what actual feminism is .But I think this would never happen!!!!Stand for egalitarianism. Egalitarianism is equality!!!",

It is a resentment psychology typical of adolescents and is in keeping with the infantilization of modern women. All the talk of empowerment merely reveals the lack of it, truly empowered people (men and women) don't talk about themselves the whole time, they get on with things and try to work for the good of society without resorting to blame and shame. Feminism is self-absorption and solipsism all over, nurturing an acute grievance complex, feminists are never satisfied and will always complain about everybody else. It springs from a profound lack of psychic integration and is both a cause and effect of our civilizational degeneration. It is a modern conceit that feminism was invented in the late 19th Century, that is only the latest iteration, feminist movements were evident in Greece, Rome, Babylon and Persia (among others), and their appearance invariable lead to a civilizational collapse such as the one we are currently experiencing.",

            "commentText": "Decent debate. We need more of these discussions. It's easy to say \"yes it has\" but the reasons why are important. The panel touched on a good point that confuses men and confuses the entire conversation. What kind of equality is it that the feminist movement desires? Ought we to have \"men's\" newspapers and \"women's\" newspapers, or not? Are we distinct markets with different interests, or are we fundamentally the same? It seems to me that feminists are just as confused on these questions as everyone else. But feminism's method seems to be attempting to have their cake and eat it too. They want women's newspapers but they also want 'regular' newspapers to have a balanced and diverse voice that speaks to everyone. It begs the question of how they really feel about our equality. It seems that instead of some established and well-defined notion of equality, what feminism wants is anything that benefits women. As long as that confusion and lack of definition exists, feminism will be at risk of making claims or proposals that go \"too far.\"\n\nThe phrase \"too far\" can mean several things in this context. In my evaluation, too far includes anything that is a denial of science, that creates a hierarchical  status of women over men, and anything that is unrelated to the rights and privileges of women. Again, these issues only arise because everyone is still confused as to what equality should be; feminism has not provided a clear and concise definition of equality. \n\nAs such, they'll sometimes try to deny biology with the aim to increase \"equality.\" For example: trying to get <b> transgender </b>women the right to fight other women in MMA matches, despite any science that says that should not be allowed on the basis of biology. That is feminism going too far. \n\nSecondly, the sick days for period pains is one issue where some men feel that it is giving women special privileges, ones denied to men. Personally I don't see it as an issue, but it's an example of how \"equality\" may be denied for the sake of benefiting women. Another example of how feminism may go too far. \n\nLastly, feminism can go too far when it overreaches. That is, when it makes an issue unrelated to rights and privileges into a \"feminist issue\" or a women's issue. For example: \"manspreading\" is apparently a women's issue. Feminism claims that the male<b>  gender</b> is prone to spreading their legs wide, taking up unnecessary space, and this is a form of microaggression toward women, implying that the man is more worthy of space and attention, implying that men are dominant and women are submissive. When in reality, it's not abou<b> t sexis</b>m or the removing of rights and privileges, rather it's an issue of rude people that take up too much space. Whether it's a man with his legs, a women with her purse, or a child with their toys, people taking up space unnecessarily is not a feminist issue. This sort of overreaching into both mundane and serious matters, is another way that feminism can go too far. \n\nIn conclusion, a lot of these problems could be avoided if feminism or society at large could agree on exactly what kind of equality we want, what is reasonable expectations for ea<b> ch gend</b>er given our biologies, and what exactly is a women's issue as opposed to a general issue. This lack of clarity and lack of definition is what makes this conversation so difficult, confusing, and unproductive. Feminism was a lot easier to support when it was very clear about it's goals regarding equal rights and privileges under the law for all peoples. As long as feminism remains confused and as a result denies biology, asks for special privileges, and overreaches, you'll find many people saying that feminism has gone too far.",

Simple ignorance from \"experts\"? Doesn't it seem very odd to you that there were so many  professors/experts who claimed the wage gap is real without doing the proper research? Tell me if a doctor told you that you had a disease, then later said \"Oops! My bad. I misunderstood the x-rays!\" Lol how would you feel about that? So why should those \"experts\" be let off the hook so easily with an excuse of \"misunderstanding\"? I guess for the same reason as the panelist can get away with saying that if men had periods they would need the whole week off, while a man would be fired for saing something along those lines.. Whats that word feminists like to use? Ah yes..Privilege",

Honestly feminism has always seemed to be about equality, but it was never about equality it was just about giving women more rights and it's still about that. Like if feminism was about equality why don't feminist ever argue to get rid of alimony and forced child support payments from men? Since the dawn of feminism no feminist ever argued that this was unfair and needed to be stopped or argued that women should be forced to do this as well. They didn't argue against it because it helped women. And recently some women are being forced to give alimony to their ex husband and all feminist are angry about it. If a movement is really about equality why get mad about being treated equally? \nFeminism is about giving women more power 'empowering women' it's not about equality and it never was. If you want equality you are not a feminist. If you say you are then you either don't know what feminism is about or what the word equality means",

The Ombudsman, if he/she is doing their job, should be interested in actually investing to read how the public responds in open forums. But when our system with CBC is now MORE censored, this clear fact being overlooked by such overseers of government misbehavior suggests that even the utility of complaining in secret to the very government officials against their own power is mute. We need to witness CBC on all issues to be open to forum discussions such as this. This is NOT the case as most stories LOCK OUT commenting AND, I've noticed, edit OUT comments that are either unwelcomed OR used to purposely caricature the extremes however trivial they actually represent.",

                    "commentText": "Cool. I'm hoping that this is only a period of confusion upon the relatively fast changes in technology today. But at present, there is a strong trend to censor for the sake of 'snowflake' sensitivities. It is an era where people are being targeted as worthy of being ignored strategically when this act itself is more aggressive than a literal punch in the face. Then and only then do those who feel backstabbed begin to step up and explode. We need to allow people to express freely and count on others to compete with reasoning to alleviate each others concerns. \n\nI get the apparent 'anger' seeping through by many 'feminists' for this VERY reason. But it can't be done by simultaneously silencing the opposition. This is just making it seem that to BEAT the problem, many are opting not to deal with the problem directly but to learn HOW to BEAT back. It only escalates the issues and creates more dangers when a NEW class of people just become the next victims. Men today are being treated as complicit to past 'Patriarchic' behaviors against women when the reality is that 'Matriarchal' factors are equally the contributing problem. The men OR women particularly penalized by certain actions are often not ORIGINALLY abusers themselves. But we are creating them when laws are enforced to isolate or distinguish men from women as universals when they aren't. The actual 'winners' tend to still BE the actual men or women who enhance social stereotypes that cause the abuses but SACRIFICE all others who don't comply with the segregations being imposed by them. This makes the 'victims' become the next generation of overthetop abusers as they BLOW up and simply confirm that such abuses ARE those victims and not the real hidden perpetrators.",

This fact alone should NEVER occur nor be censored where they have (they remove comments to shape the impression of respondants!) \n\nThe fact that on that \"At Issue\" asks what was most assumed to be significant as a change, two factors stand out: technology AND an almost universal imbalance of women on staff. The commenting that gets censored is to 'protect' those presumed 'weak' without realizing such behavior WEAKENS democratic freedoms of the people. It appears that the means to defeat discrimination has the tendency to merely TRANSFER which groups are favored rather than become more universal against it.\n\nWe NEED more power to speak than is being offered, especially on the CBC sites directly. They are censored in discretion with absolute protection to hide WHO the censors are. But I once pointed out that our 'Canadian' sites are not even OURS. The censoring is thus of some private interest group who owns the sites and could represent ANYONE, even a foreign interest group. They are clearly ANTI-freedom of speech components who are 'sensitive' to jump on 'hate' accusations uncertainly founded (because we can no longer see them to judge.)",
