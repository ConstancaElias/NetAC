        "postText": "Unfortunately, transgender people don\u2019t only face rejection by a romantic interest, they sometimes face abuse when they disclose their past, too.', 'But when 23-year-old trans woman Tiffany Monroe told a man she was chatting to that she was trans, he reacted in the best possible way: he told her it didn\u2019t matter.', 'Tiffany, from Texas, wrote on her Twitter: \u2018I told this guy I was trans and look at his response.\u2019', 'Screenshots of a conversation between them showed that he said: \u2018I ain\u2019t worried too much about that if that\u2019s the case, you\u2019re a woman and I\u2019m not gay. It\u2019s 2019, I\u2019m a grown man, your past shouldn\u2019t matter like that.\u2019', 'The tweet went viral, with the guy being commended for his sweet response.', 'Many felt that in a world where trans people are abused and dehumanised, it was a breath of fresh air to see someone react so positively.', 'Others said that what he did shouldn\u2019t warrant praise as it\u2019s basic human decency, but since it\u2019s so rare to see, he deserves it.', '', 'One user wrote: \u2018I don\u2019t want to praise him for the simple fact that we\u2019re praising him for treating someone like a damn human being, as he should, but I\u2019m going to praise him because people ain\u2019t sh*t anymore\u2019.', 'Another person replied to the tweet saying: \u2018In a world where trans people are treated so horribly dehumanised, it\u2019s an absolute breath of fresh air to see responses like that. Although, it should be the bare minimum and just common.\u2019', 'Many told Tiffany to marry the man or hold on to him, though she hasn\u2019t revealed whether they are still dating or what she said to him.', 'She thanked her followers for the sweet messages, saying: \u2018Thank you to all the lovely people being so nice to me, you all are beautiful, deserve love and I hope you have a good day!\u2019', 'Though we certainly need more of this kind of behaviour, let\u2019s hope we see it so often that it is no longer out of the ordinary or praiseworthy \u2013 it\u2019s simply about being a good person.",

These people are talking as if he's not interested, but having a kind heart and pretending to be interested, to not hurt her feelings.If he's still desires her, that's not an 'action' worthy of being knighted, it's just a simple attraction.Good luck to them if they do get together and like each other, but let's not go overboard and pretend he's somehow sacrificing something or done something incredible. Being initially attracted to someone, is not doing something incredible.",
