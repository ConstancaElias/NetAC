        "postText": "A mother killed her baby daughter by rubbing heroin on her gums to get her to sleep, court papers say.', 'Kimberly Nelligan, 33, is said to have used the substance on one year-old Jordy at least 15 times before the infant died in October 2018.', 'The little girl was found dead at her home in Bangor, Maine, by emergency responders, with Nelligan arrested in connection with her death on Monday. Nelligan gave the finger to reporters during a foul-tempered court appearance on Wednesday.', 'A coroner later determined that Jordy had synthetic opioid fentanyl in her system, a powerful painkiller than is often mixed with heroin and which is 50 times more powerful. Their report determined that Jordy had ingested the drug, and said this could have happened if it had been rubbed around the inside of her mouth.', 'Despite the severity of the allegations facing Nelligan, she posted a Facebook photo of drugs and drug paraphernalia in June this year, with the caption \u2018Yay buddy.\u2019', 'The mother also condemned Ohio cheerleader Skylar Richardson, 20, who was cleared of murdering her baby but convicted of burying the girl\u2019s corpse last week.', 'Nelligan wrote on Facebook: \u2018Kills me i would do anything to have my baby back stupid bitch she is.\u2019', 'The mother reportedly confessed to using heroin once a week in the months leading up to Jordy\u2019s death, with the child\u2019s dad telling cops he\u2019d seen Nelligan rub it on the little girl\u2019s gums.', 'Nelligan is said to have told that unnamed man she\u2019d done the same to her older children to get them to sleep, and added: \u2018You know I didn\u2019t hurt our daughter on purpose.\u2019', 'She has been charged with child endangerment, and is also set to face a charge of being in possession of a Schedule Z drug.",

Yes, I know this is horrible and regardless of whether it's pot or not in the picture she shouldn't have it all laying there in the open but the pot is irrelevant to this case is all I am saying. I smoke for anxiety and I don't smoke around kids buy I will say that I know many that smoke that are not impaired and can still perform any duty necessary. Pot and pot paraphernalia are not the issues here. Her drug problem with opiates is the problem here. Her recklessness and irresponsibility is the problem here. I have read many articles and I also know her and I don't even know why she had custody of that kid to begin with if she wasn't going to even attempt to get her act together. She gives parents in recovery that actually try to do the right thing a bad name. She has other kids this will hurt but at least they will be alive. I can tell by your response you don't agree with my comment and that is absolutely fine. I am not standing up for her, I am simply saying that I expected a photo of actual paraphernalia like baggies, needles and straws, not stuff for marijuana that she had a legal prescription for.",

The problem is when the parents start doing drugs after the child is home. In this case the father should have stepped in and protected his child. Doesn't matter what the courts do now, the child is dead. Hopefully the parents will never takea free breath again.",
