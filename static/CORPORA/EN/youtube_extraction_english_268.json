Just because Israel is called the Jewish State doesn't mean it's not Democratic. ALL are welcome ONLY if they respect they're fellow Israeli, abide the rules, no hate, etc. \n\nLastly. Don't say that Arab's rights are violated in Israel, they're not. Israel is one of the few (non fascist) State in the entire region that GUARENTEES these rights! If a Jew would walk down the streets of Ramallah (stab). But Israel allows Arabs the same rights, liberties, and opportunities, and not to mention the Joint Arab, Pro PLO party, in the Knesset (Parliament).",

If people of color become anti american.  Then americans must not support every sigle issue that people of color support.  This is not an automatic thing.  If someithing is called racisit.  That is called \"<b> racist\"</b> that does not automatically mean that  people should be against it.  First of all it may not be<b>  racist</b> and is just lable<b> d racis</b>t for poltictial reasons.   Get this we are in essance a eurpoean alignend  nations and that is were we need to stand.  And that is were even wise people of color stand.  The Arab world is terrible, even if it does represent people of color, that is not reason to support it.  In this world people of color run nations that I would not want to live in.  So don't support those nations just because people of color run them.  This is the trunt, there is <b> NO nati</b>on run by people<b>  of Afri</b>can decent that funtions well.  And not all of that is du<b> e to ra</b>cism, it is do to the inablility of the persons runing it to function.   Now draw what conclusions you may, but it is a good reason not to support them.",

The Rothschilds were there, with their greedy hands out-stretched, for repayment for loans that were used to win the Revolutionary war. Criticizing zionist bankers, or their comrades, AIPAC, is certainly not anti-semetic, because the Israeli citizens, in Israel, are under the same financial thumb that the USA is. AIPAC, and 86 congressional members, who are dual citizens with Israel, are watch dogs for the federal, <b> nazi </b>zionists, to make sure that the bankers get every penny that they can from their American slaves, including jews who are not zionists. Every zionist is not a jew, such as Hannity and Biden, who are Catholic, which is related to<b>  nazi</b> zionism(revived Roman Empire), in that the star on the flag of Israel is the same insignia found on the golden papal mitre, which unites the Romans and the Catholics, ie., the Roman Catholic Church. The zionist Rothschilds took over the finances of Vatican City in 1823, thereby putting the whole political portion of the Catholic Church in subjugation to the Khazarian mafia. Without fear, or favor, we who love ham, must tell it like it is. The zionists get a lot more money than the 3.8 billion/yr, because they get a lot of money which is earmarked for other expensive projects, but is funneled secretly, and unlawfully to them.

Their districts are horrible stop wasting our taxpayer money. And calling for impeachment against the president which has already been tried and it's a waste of our time and money we are tired of it as people on the Democratic and Republican side even the left is getting tired of it. We wouldn't stand for if it was on the Republican side and neither would they. Israel is a partner with the United States not to mention the Holy Land these girls are prejudiced against the Holy Land. They are here to destroy everything our forefathers have worked for we have came so far since slavery. But these girls seem to be trying to bring it all back all the bad memories. What happened in the past stays in the past it's done. It time to start a new trend. But how can you when you got these for clowns trying to make and bring up things from the past. And calling people Nazis. Go back where you belong how you got to let it had to been a big mistake. These girls were planted in the government to bring down the United States. Socialist disgusting",

The real issue is why does the Arab Israeli conflict, out of over 200 armed territorial conflicts get so much attention in the international media as opposed to for example the India pakistan conflict over kashmir, which is far more dangerous than the Arab Israeli conflict given that they both have nuclear weapons? Either it's because israel is uniquely flawed and evil and worse than every other state in the developing world. Or is it because it the Jewish state? Either way her comments signaled malign intent on the part of Israel and the Jewish people and ought to be responded to",

Khazars converted to Judaism. Anyone who converts to Judaism is called a Jew. A Jew today is not someone by DNA\nSemitic refers to Shem, therefore refers to descendants of Shem. \nShem is the son of Noah\nKhazar jews to refer themselves as askhenazis, and askenaz is a descendant of Japheth\nJapheth was also a son of Noah. and descendants of Japheth are gentiles. God said so in the bible\nThe Jews that call themselves Jews but are not, and are lying, and are of the synagogue of Satan. Jesus said so\n\nIsraelites were the descendants of Jacob who was a Semite\nIsraelis are citizens of Israel, that was created in 1947, are not semites.\nAn Israeli is someone who has an Israeli passport. There are arab-israelis\nSpot the difference Israelites and Israelis. Very deceptive\nAll this is historical and biblical fact",

How deep its influence on public opinion is in all the enemy countries and many neutral nations is plain to see that it may never be mentioned in newspapers, speeches, and radio broadcasts. There is a law in the Soviet Union that punishes anti-Semitism \u2014 or in plain English, public education about the Jewish Question \u2014 by death. The expert in these matters is in no way surprised that a leading spokesman for the Kremlin said over the New Year that the Soviet Union would not rest until this law was valid throughout the world. In other words, the enemy clearly says that its goal in this war is to put the total domination ofJewry over the nations of the earth under legal protection, and to threaten even a discussion of this shameful attempt with the death penalty.'  \u2013 Joseph Goebbels",

But some facts merit mention:\r\n\r\n* In the US, Steven Miller has been actively promoting the racialization of Central American asylum seekers, which is a head scratcher given  all  that's outlined in this article.  AIPAC has been  mute.  \r\n\r\n* David Frum just published an article in the Atlantic magazine arguing for the freezing of all US immigration.  Sounds like he's trying to confuse the public with the argument that will be used against the Palestinians' right of return. 'A country has the right to say no to immigration.'\r\n\r\n* US Neocons forced the Iraqi invasion/destruction, and in the process destabilizing the Middle Esast. Millions were displaced and millions have entered the Europe, while its economies have yet to recover from the 2008 US-driven economic recession\r\n\r\n* Netanyahu, US casino owner Sheldon Adelson et al engineered  Jerusalem's and most recently the Golan Heights land grab.    Concurrently, some media headlines have been arguing there has been no reaction to the announcement to legitimize it .  Really? \r\n\r\n* The Likud Party issued a manifesto announcing the unilateral appropriation of the occupied territories.  \r\n\r\n* Bob Rubin & friends eliminated the Glass-Steagall Act, which allowed 'Sandy Weill' to create a financial supermarket meant to stimulate market competitiveness.   The ensuing looting caused the 2008 Great Recession & destruction of  American families.",

Also its deeply unfair in America to label innocent people anti semitic if they criticise Isreali actions and America's <b> blind </b<b> >dumb</b> support for Isreali actions.

True Israel is still in this world today and is yet a people despised by many nations of the world.

The problem is for Israel to remain a Jewish and secure state they need to keep the voting majority Jewish or else (there is sufficient historical evidence to believe) you would see an <b> ethnic </b>cleansing of Jews by an Arab voting majority.  Many Arabs living in Israel (about 1.5 million) have voting rights.  However, those living outside the \"green lines\" in places such as the West Bank and Gaza, do not.  For Israel, it comes down to one thing:  security and survival.  Our mottos in America are often some variation of, \"Justice for all\", or \"E pluribus Unum\", or \"Don't tread on me\".  Their motto is essentially this one thing: \"everyone to the north, south, east, and west of us wants us dead, so the rules will be written to accommodate that unfortunate truth\"",

Just because you are a government member voicing your opinions about the continues wrong doings of Israeli officials, does not mean you are antisemitic!  Though I do also agree many of the comments and opinions Ilhan Omar speaks of or tweets about does have a hidden antisemitism tone to it!!  So I'm kind of on the fence about this one!!\n\n\nAll this antisemitism needs to come to a STOP!!!  One would think in the 21st century all this hatred, hostility and discrimination towards one group of people, those being of the Jewish faith, would have ended!!  For crying out bloody loud, this has been going on literally for centuries!!!  And each century brings with it another horrible version for a reason, solely based on <b> racism </b>and hatred, to continue on with this antisemitism mania!!  \n\n\nThe history of antisemitism, defined as hostile actions or discrimination against Jews as a religious or<b>  ethnic</b> group, goes back many centuries, with antisemitism being called \"the longest hatred\".  Jerome Chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism:\n\r\n1. Pre-Christian anti-Judaism in Ancient Greece and Rome which was primaril<b> y ethni</b>c in nature\r.\n2. Christian antisemitism in antiquity and the Middle Ages which was religious in nature and has extended into modern times.\r\n3. Muslim antisemitism which was\u2014at least in its classical form\u2014nuanced, in that Jews were a protected class.\r\n4. Political, social and economic antisemitism of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment Europe which laid the groundwork for racial antisemitism\r.\n5. Racial antisemitism that arose in the 19th century and culminated in Nazism\r.  The Holocaust!!!\n6. Contemporary antisemitism which has been labeled by some as the new antisemitism.\n\n\nDon't Forget .... Jesus Christ was Jewish!!!  He was born of a Jewish mother, in Galilee, a Jewish part of the world. All of his friends, associates, colleagues, disciples, all of them were Jewish. He regularly worshiped in Jewish communal worship, what we call synagogues. He preached from Jewish text, from the Bible. He celebrated the Jewish festivals. He went on pilgrimage to the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem where he was under the authority of priests.  He was born, lived, taught and died as a Jew. \n\n\nSTOP all this antisemitism in any and all forms!!  I am not saying this because I am Jewish, because I am not.   I'm just sick and tired of all t<b> he raci</b>sm and hatred in this country and the world in any forms!!!",

Huge amounts of money are given by Christian Zionists such as Philip Anschutz, one of the richest men in the world.  One reason a broad based audit needs to be made is to find out how much money is given by Jews, how much by Christian Zionists, and how much by defense contractors who profit from U.S. military aid.  I suspect that the majority of money comes from Christian Zionists.  Hell, it was a Christian Zionist named Orde Wingate who founded the Israeli Army.  Those people are <b> crazy.</b>",

            "commentText": "As an Israeli, I believe critisizing the government's policy is fair game and is not antisemetic. I am opposed to many actions of my governmet and critisize it too. However, some of Ms. Omar's previous comments shown in this viedeo are baseless and either biased or stem from a lack of knowledge. (Given that she does not seem eager to critisize much worse regimes, including those of muslim countries - sadly I suspect that the first option is true). I live in the north of Tel-Aviv and have Arab muslim neighbors living in my building. All citizens of Israel - regardless of religion - enjoy human rights, are allowed to vote, and Israel has - and has always had Arab muslims represented in it's government. True, this does not include the residents of the West Bank who are not citizens of Israel; they vote in their own elections, but they are not an independant country. Many of us here wish they were a neighboring independant country, but it is a complicated issue to resolve given that many of the Palestenian leaders refuse to accept that Israel has a right to exist. Also, yes - I admit we are scared of muslims having too much influence in our country - not because we do not respect their rights - but because of how that will devestate women's rights and <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>rights here. The current situation is definately not OK, and I do not condone israeli settlement in the occupied territories - which I believe should stop. But Israel is neither attempting or conducting any genocide (that's a rediculous claim - given the force of our military, think what would happen if that were true - While actually, the population of the West Bank - same as Gaza - has been steadily growing). So bottom line - it's a complicated situation. Everyone should absolutely have the right to comment or critisize without facing backlash for bein<b> g racis</b>t. But as a politician, you should be well informed about politics of the countries and issues you wish to critisize, and you should try to be unbiased - in some of her previous comments, I believe Ms. Omar has failed to meet that standard.",

You may not agree with our Muslim beliefs but at least we Muslims are not colonizing and stealing land based on our religious belief, unlike the zionist jews who stole palestine because they really believe their God gave them the land. 100 years of zionist colonialism is still going on. Daily land and home theft, almost daily or weekly killing of palestinians, checkpoints, walls, nightly raids, zionist settler violence, burning crops, vandalizing mosques etc. All this because the zionist jews want to kick out the native palestinians because they colonial fuckers believe that the land really belongs to them. These zionist jews come from Europe, USA, South America, Russia, middle east, Africa and Asia, basically from all over the world.",

He was found guilty on hundreds of counts, including making more than 2,000 anonymous bomb threats against mostly Jewish community centres,\u00a0 schools and synagogues in the United States, creating panic, marketing extortion services and earning around $240,000 in bitcoin from bomb threats -- \"The goal of the defendant was to cause public panic, to send many emergency forces to the threatened area, to cause an urgent evacuation of the place, to conduct searches and scans and to create a media echo that would enhance the damage inherent in his actions,\" --- the court said. --- Kadar will be sentenced later and faces possible extradition to the United States to face similar hate crime charges. The threats from the Jewish dual US-Israeli teen had stoked fears of rising anti-Semitism in the United States.",

            "commentText": "but when people criticize islam she, along with many of you, call it 'hate speech'?\nironic isn't it\n\nbut here's the difference: islam has tons of theoretical and practical problems, especially true if you compare it with western secular and universal values. Those that try to 'explain' them doing dawah mostly beautify and cherrypick certain verses , leaving out the rest even when its not really implemented whenever muslims had the power to do so (eg: islamic nations, muslim own internal communities in nonmuslim nations like those islamic schools in the west)\ncriticism of it for certain, based on actual problems and, again, even more problematic when you uphold western secular values\n\non the other hand, the hate against israel by muslims (nearly all of the religious ones), are mainly based on discriminative hate out of ignorance. In indonesia, the most populous muslim <b> nation,</b> also known to be 'less radical' than the arab muslim nations mainly, the muslim population nearly all of them have negative and worse attitude towards israelis and jews\n- there is literally no viable jewish community in the<b>  nation</b>, nearly none of them ever encounter a jew in their life\n- they also have no idea about how the occupation starts (initiated by the arab muslim coalition own action)\n- they have no idea mostly about the 20% muslim arab israelis\n- they have no idea about the religious tolerance in israel, while not perfect, is the most proggressive and civilized (they're pretty much secular jews by now) in the whole north-african and middle-eastern region. Far better than religious tolerance in nearly all other muslim nations in the region\n\nand you have these extremely biased reporting about the conflict, ulemas preaches demonizing jews and israel, and people share it frequently on social media\nunreasonable hate out of unreasonable basis, this is very existent among muslim communities worldwide, not just there. The same goes with ilhan omar , which is also a religious muslim with her rather-islamist views (she's also a nice friend of linda sarsour. Yes, that linda that makes Woman's March movement transformed into an anti-semitic movement, and people fall for it simply because she said she 'fights for woman')\nher anti semitic and anti israel views is rather obvious, the same can be seen by nearly all of the other religious muslims \n\nyou, say, as a nonmuslim liberal (christian, buddhist, atheist, whatever you like), might had a more reasonable basis to criticize israel even though this still involves ignorance (as i said, israel is the most proggressive and civilized in the whole region, and palestinians are far far away from having similar views on this). Nonetheless, your concern might be 'human rights' and so on\nBut thats not the same with nearly all religious muslims worldwide that are anti-israel. The anti-israel propaganda out of religious basis is ver<b> y commo</b>n among their communities, so mainly the reasons they have for that is not 'legitimate criticism' (as they're doing far worse mostly) but simply religious hate, positioning them as 'muslim lands' even though it is not",

Virginia. Democrat Gov. Ralph NORTHAM posed in a racially charged costume during his college days, making a mockery of the African-Americans in his state. Today's DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION (DNC) has embraced anti-Semitism with fervor against Jewish Americans. The new wave of Congressional Democrats is spewing similar hate speech. Two such anti-Semites that were thoroughly vetted and endorsed by the Democratic National Committee are Michigan Rep. Rashida TLAIB and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan OMAR. Speaker Nancy Pelosi championed their cause by seating them on powerful committees, even passing over mor<b> e senio</b>r politicians. The two Muslim upstarts immediately engaged in targeting U.S.-ISRAEL relations and let loose a bevy of hate speech when they discovered they would not be able to undermine American policy toward the Jewish State.",

I am not a religious person, I don't believe in any god at all, not even the so called jewish god. I am sure that some jews will say that I am anti-semitic because of that. I think that what is happening in Israel today is criminal behavior, they violate international laws and resolutions. To my opinion Israel is one of the most intolerant countries in the world.

In America you have to right to hate Israel or live Israel or even Jews for that matter. Since when did we start telling people what they can & cant think & who they have to like or dislike? Lets be real, this attack on this Congresswoman is creating more dislike for Israel & will only polarize people more. \nThis is America so criticize away, its your right & what your ancestors fought & died for. This hate speech crap is just a way for Government to become more powerful. Whats more TOTALITARIAN That telling what you can & can not say?",

You can be against building settlements on Palestinian land or against the blockade of Gaza without being antisemitic,  but when you start spewing bullshit like Israel is an apartheid state, a statement which is demonstrably false or that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians when the Palestinian population has increased over the last 30 years, you are just trying to stir up hatred of Israel generally, which leads to and often comes from hatred of Jews.",

You seem to want to connect White Imperialism to Israel but as you said we're not White or European.  And the Hebrew language is also not a European language and the way you assume that I would say no just because you're not Jewish says a lot about your misconception about Jews.  I would absolutely love if we could have peace but yeah this land is absolutely the land of my ancestors,  I'm not even talking about religion here,  like we know we came from Jerusalem.  And yes totally we all need to get along with each other.  I just wish Arabs were at the forefront of preventing another Jewish genocide.  Who knows,  I believe in the Messiah and a world of peace,  maybe Arabs and their HUGE population would start it by loving us Jews so much that we could have open borders.  I'll be for that.",

I understand there is a large group of Semites (Arabs which most refer to as, \"Palestinian\") living in the state of Israel, within the Occupied Territories, in <b> refugee </b>camps in Lebanon, and elsewhere that the Congresswoman is concerned about.  Just based on what I've read to date, it seems that Congresswoman Omar is very much Pro-Semitic.\n\nOf course my Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th Edition) could be in error where the following is written for \"Semite\":\n\"Semite\" - 1(a) a member of any number of peoples of ancient southwestern Asia including the Akkadians, Phoenicians, Hebrews and Arabs. (b) a descendent of these peoples. 2. A member of a modern people speaking a Semitic language. \"Semite\" comes from \"Shem\", the name of one of Noah's (from Genesis) three sons, and a person recognized by the Jewish, Christian and Muslim faiths.",

Jews immigrated to Isreal from Europe before 1948 and historically in ancient times according to their texts too. But the Levant was always inhabitated by Arabs, Bedouins and Phoenician stock and admixtures. History is history, they were exiled by the Romans, conquests, migrations and life went on in the Levant. Now, they want to claim an ancient homeland by committing genocide, Apartheid and revising history. And Americans have to fund and support this, because Europe committed the unspeakable, so Arab inconveniences can be lived with? Humans are tribal but the world we have created and the power we now wield doesn't allow us to behave according to such follies.",

Most Isrealis are descents of migrants from Europe or the Middle East to Palestine. This American support of Isreali Apartheid won't endear Middle Easterners to the West even when they become democratic. Its the reason, most POC in the third world hate capitalism, theit experience of it was terrible, imperialism and exploitation. The US has to stop making good things look bad. Eventually, Isreal will be a lost cause @ the rate its going, the US won't be capable to defend it forever, like the Holy Roman Empire failed to defend the Crusader outposts in the Middle ages.",

Ms Rashida Tlaib from Detroit ,is a Brownskin Palestinian semite. She didn't call her an antisemite. Pelosi,Schumer are gentile whites ;why are they so vocal about a lobby for a Jewish foreign government ?? What's in it for them since they said <b> nothing </b>when Ms Omar criticized Saudi Arabia(Semites)??? They are not as quick on their feet calling out whitesupremacy.

It's simply an effort to silence anyone who dares to speak the obvious truth about Israel's brutal subjugation of the Palestinian people. Generalized negativity toward Jewish people would be antisemitic, but Rep Omar was obviously speaking about the Israeli gov't influencing American policy, something that should concern everyone! She was simply pointing out the effects of AIPAC's influence on American politicians, just like she has done with Saudi Arabia and other lobbying organizations. This ridiculous, cynical smearing MUST be stopped. There must be a price to pay for those who attempt to circumvent our freedom of speech to enrich themselves or for campaign contributions. Every American citizen must be free to speak their minds on these important issues.",

Palestine was meant to be shared in an agreeable manner not this untenable forced effort to preserve and expand settlements that will never be legal nor secure without committing a wholesale genocide of Palestinians and Muslims. Isreal is more Westernized but that doesn't make it better or justify funding Apartheid or genocide to keep a colonial outpost in the Levant. Remember it's been tried before in history, the Crusades, it didn't end well. Palestinians maybe resorting to terrorism but that doesn't take away their right to self defense or self determination. The US is a superpower in a changing world, the rise of the non Western world or POC, should give pause to US policy, the US is supposed to solve and arbitrate these crisis not pick winners or losers, otherwise it will lose its authority (right to exercise power) in the eyes of the world and become just another great power, everyone fears and contrive against to fail or fall.

And I find it really how something as benign as Israel today can literally rile up not only the far right, they hate Israel, but aslo with the left and  specially the far left. It's really disturbing. Literally the only group who continue to defend and work with Israel are the conservative evengelicals and of course the Jews themselves. Obviously for a lot of people reading this, they are spiritually <b> blind </b>and therefore will dismiss what I'm saying... but it's just really concerning. There shouldn't be a public out cry against Zionism. And it's very concerning how both political spectrum are united on an issue that really dosent even impact their lives... they just both seem to dislike Israel for reasons. It's satanic because it's leading to a picture of how the whole world can be united against Israel.",

Lord Baron Jacob Rothschild gave an interview on YouTube about his family's involvement in restoring Israel in Palestine in 1948. Baron Jacob Rothschild was a \"Lord\" in The House of Lords. I wonder how many people know that it was mentioned in The Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. 10, published in 1906, pp. 490 that Mayer Amschel Rothschild's son, was an agent of Prince William Landgravy IX of Hesse Cassel (sometimes spelled with a \"K\") who funded British Troops against The American Revolution? It was also mentioned in The Journals of The House of Commons published by The Parliament of Great Britain in 1803 that Prince William Landgrave IX of Hesse Kassel out of Germany married Princess Mary, the daughter of King George II from Great Britain. Also, it is mentioned through History <b> Dot </b>Com that The Royal Marriage Act of 1772 led to Queen Victoria's Matchmaking of her nine children's 42 grand children, \"Eventually, seven of them sat on European thrones in Russia, Greece, Romania, Britain, Germany, Spain and Norway\u2014and all would take sides during World War I with disastrous consequences.\" Should I mention more that mainstream media doesn't talk about? Hmmm? Should I share URL Links to all that?",

But personally, I don't think that was what she said at all. AIPAC IS buying politicians, just as the NRA, Koch Brothers, and Wall Street are (and Omar made sure to include that in her apology statement). I think this was mostly Islamophobia at play because I don't think a white, non-Muslim politician would get this type of reaction for saying AIPAC is influencing our politicians.",

I think everyone wants to see less homelessness but, this country is 21 trillion dollars in debt. Most of the mentally ill can not be helped, no matter how much funding. Yet our bridges, roads and national parks can be helped with funding.\u00a0\nAs for the 2008 financial crisis, the cause of it was government forcing banks to lend money to people who couldn't afford the loans.... therefore causing the housing crash... over regulation, not deregulation caused 2008.\u00a0\nI'd also love to see people treat this planet better. I try hard to never waste anything. I don't think any Republicans want dirty air and dirty water like Democrats accuse them of wanting.  But look at the new \"green deal\" from AOC. In 10 years, it would ban gas and oil engines ( basically everything that moves). It would ban commercial flights and it would give money to those who \"choose not to work\".\nWhen I heard that dozens of Democrats in Congress support a plan that is so absurd, I just can't see how any American can continue to support the Democrat party.\u00a0\nEspecially went in the last 2 years, Donald Trump has been one of the most economically successful presidents in decades. I think people only dislike him because of negative media reporting and not factual / non-biased reporting.  In terms of success, he's helped create the best economy in the last 5 years... and the media never gives him credit for any of it. I just heard today that over 96% of media reporting on Donald Trump is negative. Seems odd when he's done so many great things for this country. \n@Jeff Campbell",

                    "commentText": "@Tobias Forge Thanks, Tobias. I think we all need to remember that within the parties are people of diverse opinion. I can tell you that AOC represents a fringe of democrats, not even 15%, so I keep wondering why people get overheated about her. More people support the idea of medicare for all, but realistic discussion of funding it changes everything. We dems love America, and the majority of us are logical and mean well. Everyone needs to get back to the understanding that people vote their interests, and that's reasonable and principled. My Texas friends are in the oil and gas business and voting Republican means their family income is higher. They're wonderful people. Americans need to get off each other's back about our politics, religion or lack thereof, income and bedroom activities. Somehow we've decided privacy is meaningless and our opinions are sooooo important that everyone should share them. I'll tell you one of my life lessons: I protested Pres. Bush's victory, and I demonized him as a person. Once he was out of office I realized, bit by bit, how foolish I'd been. Obviously, he's a nice guy with good morals who did his best and made decisions in what he thought was the best interests of all of us. I kept thinking about that as some on the right demonized Obama. I don't know why right and left interpret things so differently, but I want us to go back to being friends despite having different beliefs and opinions. My Army platoon was like a family: God only knows what some of those guys believed, but it just didn't MATTER, you know?",

When I used to talk to my son, Cody, about his behavior and he would try to point out that Ryan's (his buddy next door) behavior was worst. I would tell him, that right now we are discussing you not Ryan. I love that term whataboutism, I didn't have it back then or I would have used it. Now when I was little and I tried the same thing with my dad, he wasn't about to listen to that crap either. He would say things like if your friends are jumping off the cliff does that mean you will also do that.  But that is how I was raised, obviously it was different for you.\nWhat my dad meant and what I meant was that the bad behavior of others does not excuse your own bad behavior.\nNow I understand that the idea of an Apartheid does not bother you as you are probably white. But I am <b> Black </b>so I don't like it. You may want to support that kind of behavior with your tax dollars, but I do not.\nI am 63 years<b>  old</b> and I was part of the Boycott, Divest and Sanction South Africa. We stopped buying Coke because they were in South Africa.  If you ask me that is what really changed things in South Africa when THE People acted through their pocketbooks. \nMostly I feel sad about Israel, as a child I was so happy that God's people were back in Israel. It just seemed right. As an adult I am able to separate Jewish people from Israel as a government. I don't like how their government operates. And the fact we support them having free healthcare (something the US cannot even afford) is amazing (we need the kind of lobbyist they have). But lately it that they have a SPACE PROGRAM that really gets my goat. We have slashed NASA so much we don't even have our own space shuttles anymore!!! No they do not need any of our money. \nI don't want to give any money to anybody in the middle east so if we are giving money to Lebanon, Iran, Saudi Arabia, UAE, or any of them I say stop....But I don't think my tax dollars support their space programs. \nAs someone once said IT IS ALL ABOUT THE BENJAMINS.",
