        "postText": " The strange truth about Donald and Melania's marriage! Interesting facts about the marriage of president Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump. 16. Who is Melania Trump- Donald Trump's third wife, Melania, is the first and only lady to be born in and from a communist country. She was raised in a tower block in Yugoslavia, which makes her the first lady to be born outside of the United States. She started modeling at just five years old. She was later signed to a top modeling agency in Milan, Italy, when she turned eighteen. As a teenager she studied design and architecture at the University of Ljubljana. At that time she was traveling to Milan for work where she was signed on to a talent agency. While Melania was in Italy, she was on the path to meet her billionaire husband. In 1996 she moved to New York on a work visa, and has appeared on Magazine covers such as New York Magazine, Harper's Bazaar in Bulgaria, Vogue in Italy, and GQ in the United Kingdom. In 1998 she started dating Donald Trump, then the two of them got married in 2005, she gave birth to their son, Barron, a year later. Melania stayed in New York with Barron until he finished the school year then they both moved to Washington to join Donald in June 2017. Her nickname for Donald is 'Little Donald' because he loves wearing a suit and tie so much. Other than being viewed as a trophy wife, people say she is a crucial part of Team Trump and the most powerful woman in the world. Melania is forty seven years old and speaks five languages: English, German, Serbian, French, and Slovene. She's also 5ft 11 inches, which makes her one of the tallest first ladies in history. 15. When did Donald and Melania get married- When the two first met Donald was fifty-two years old, they met at a party at the Kit Kat Club during New York Fashion Week in 1998. At first, the supermodel was turned off by the billionaire. Melania told the New York Times when she met him she told her friends, 'He's here with a woman. I am absolutely not giving him my number.' So instead Donald ended up giving her all his numbers, home, and business, and she gave him a call when she got back from a modeling trip. After his second marriage collapsed to Marla Maples, the two started dating. They got married in 2005 and had lots of famous faces at the wedding. Bill and Hillary Clinton attended as well. Melania's wedding dress cost $100,000 and took five hundred and fifty hours to make. ",

Melania making the choice to make money in modeling, which can only be achieve during the youthful years, was the smarter choice. It is well documented that she speaks 5 Languages, so you suggesting it's a lie, seems strange .. Needing to invalidate her doesn't make your political opinions more valuable, nor you more valuable.. None of us women like the trophy wife.. But, as annoying as the trophy wife position is, Melania is a trophy.. She is smart, beautiful, and wealthy because of it! It's easy to feel diminished in comparison..   But, it just makes you look bitter and resentful to negate that reality of Melania's obvious glory..  Face it, she's earned her money! She has to kiss ' The Donald' \ud83e\udd22",

            "commentText": "All the Trumps get way too much attacked personally - totally the whole family, even the little boy gets denigrated - that is very much a deterioration of political culture, even of civilized behaviour.   The First Lady, Melania, like others before her, tries very hard to be acting supportive of her elected president husband, being ladylike and respectful.  I believe Melania does quite well having been suddenly thrust into that position.  \n\nI hate that a free and honourable multiple candidates competing in elections get so personally attacked.  Media of various political leanings try to find any negative crumb however minimal about candidates or their families, which then gets made into big boulders to crush the opponent.  And that same attitude gets carried over by both sides into the time spent as president.  Unfortunately the current president is guilty of such behaviour himself.  He gets what he gives.  And he gives what he gets.  And that way is being leader and example too.  That's too sad.  I wish one could wake up out of the present day unpleasant and uncivilized, unsupervised grade-school-lunch-fights type of political climate of it being miraculously over.  Who manages to be confident again of such dreams coming true?",

Donald's friend had procured for them two  professional dates that evening. Trump, ever the contrarian, decided he didn't want the blonde that had been procured for him and secretly ask Melania for her phone number. Check out the interview on Larry King where they tell the story as though they think it's some romantic tale. She arrived in his life bought and paid for. Supermodel my ass.",

The Enstein Visa that she received was set up by Trump's Lawyers because it is easy to get.\nIt stated that Melania graduated from college  and knew 5 languages. To know 5 language one has to be really bright. Melania is not.  When the computer page was attacked and proven wrong, she \n admitted to not graduating from college.  Furthermore, the computer page that offered all this lying information has since been removed.  A bright person does not steal a speech that someone else has recently given.   A bright person who has studied English in college would not start a program called\"  Be Best\". A bright person would know to say: \"  Be the Best.\"   A  bright person would not marry Donald Trump no matter how much money he has . It would hurt the bright person's brain to be married to such a stupid individual.  Melania and Donnie are intellectually matched.",

(She is locked into her marriage now.) Many will ask her to give interviews and write a book which she will refuse to do because she is a private, gracious, reserved lady with refined European manners. And she would not want to hurt or humiliate her son or tarnish the image he has of his father...any more than it already is. Melania will live a life of seclusion away from the media. She will never marry because her experience has been so negative. She will keep her distance from the Trump clan.",

So no, child prostitution is not legal to any adults involved.. Adults go to jail.. And, I wish they would add castration to their sentence too..",

            "commentText": "THE TRUTH, really?\n\n\nFrom this video, one is led to believe that Melania was a little model who scored really big at 18 years of <b> age,</b> and living in Milan. The TRUTH is that Melania was a so-so, mediocre model who never graced a magazine cover, interviews and spreads until AFTER she started seeing Trump. She was never a supermodel.  When she moved to NY, she worked (prior to getting a work permit) posing in the nude for men's magazine-type photos and a couple of lesbian-style photos. Melania, Trump and the Trump campaign lied about Melania's career, but also lied about her education as her resume  indicates Melania had a degree in design and architecture from a Slovenian university, which is an enormous lie. There is also the claim that she speaks several different languages, but you can't count as \"speaking\" another language if you can only say things in Italian and French that any first semester high school 101 student can say, and it is debatable if her English can even be called \"fluent\". \n\n\n\nWho is it that says she is an invaluable part of \"team Trump\"? <b>  Nobody</b> who knows anything about her or their relationship would make that ridiculous claim. It is reported that Melania has her own bed in her own Suite at the WH and she and her son often stay at her parents' house instead of coming from being all day at school.  Her \"power\", as you call it, consists of plagiarism of Michelle Obama's speech, a copied and minimally altered booklet on cyberbullying including the cover art, from Michelle Obama.  She an<b> d Dum</b>b Donald must have come up with an agreement of sorts, to hold hands once in a while and be photographed together a little more so Trump's brainwashed masses don't get wise to the fact that she just really can't stand him and they will likely divorce when out of office in 2020... hopefully prison time will follow for Donald and several other members of the administration, the GOP, and other Trump family members.  I can see it now, Tiffany becoming the next in line and only person not in prison to run Trump's company as all other Trumps will be serving time in prison.",

A website www.snopes.com FACT CHECK: Melania Trump's College Degree says, 'There is no 'University in Slovenia,' nor is there a 'University of Slovenia.'She plagiarized part of Michelle Obama's speech. Her English is not grammatically correct and words she chooses are not the correct verb tenses many times.\nShe obviously does not want to be First Lady. The day of Trump's inauguration he looked behind him and smiled at Melania. She gave him a big smile but when he turned around, she frowned.\nShe seems miserable. The whole world knows that Donald cheated on her and paid off the women during the campaign. That must be so humiliating for her. If they stay married after he leaves office, it will be a miracle.\nOther than Donald's money, I have no idea what Melania saw in Donald. He is an immature, narcissist, an adulterer, a liar and a cheat. What kind of <b> woman </b>would want to be married to a man like that?\nI do feel bad for her. It must be so hard for her. I am a Republican but I miss Michelle Obama.\nDon't bother replying to my comment. I will just delete it. I am not going to have an online argument with an internet troll.",

I don't think that 700.000 DACA should just be let to stay here without a report as to if they're helping, or hurting our country. The other 300,000 at border patrol should not be let in the country. We don't have enough resources to make sure they're not bringing diseases that we've eradicated. Also, I believe someone is behind this massive influx. There's no way that journey had gotten to the border that quickly. Instead of fighting to force a way into u.s. they should stand United in their countries to stop the government policies. Dianne",

America is experiencing how a business man runs a giant business,  which is what America needs to solve problems,  He is willing to try to solve America's most pressing problems.   All Candidates say reform is needed but only Donald Trump trying actively to solve these costly problems.  The American Taxpayer should fall to their knees and thank him for taking our mess midst a climate of unfair and untrue criticism from fans of Hillary Clinton, the greatest crook in America. and I also like Melania.",

Using chain migration (the very thing Trump wants to abolish) her family then followed. \n\nShe cost the US taxpayers Millions & millions of dollars to keeping little Barron Bone Spurs in school in New York before public outcry made her move to Washington. She claims to be an anti-bullying lobbyist but climbs in bed with the worlds biggest most corrupt, disgusting bully on earth every night! She is like a subtle slow human cancer. Endless greed no compassion for the middle class or poor is what she has contributed to this country. She, as with the rest of the fine crime family (Ivanka, Jared, Don Jr. Erick), have been an absolute disgrace!\n\nI'll be glad to see the end of her and the rest of these lying self serving bottom dwelling autocratic narcissist!",

Melania CRIED when Trump was elected, she had alwayds unhappy about his presidency AND she remained in NY bc she didn't want to rip Barron who, as u commented is at a tender <b> age,</b> from school. They soon joined Trump at the White House. Shit, I dislike Trump, he is not fit for office but don't cherry fuckin pick & highlight what u want & oops omit the whole reason behind things just cuz it doesn't fit ur agenda. Ppl like u & Trump are hugely assisting in the breaking down trust & innocence in America & destroying humanity as we knew it. He's making kindness, open-mindedness, humility & love for others just bc they're human like him, uncool. So sad scary sad.",

                    "commentText": "@Rimusclebear 1 . . . Where do you get your information? FOX News?\n\nTo say the left portrays first lady Melania Trump unfairly is an understatement. She is frequently cast as a distant, one-dimensional <b> woman </b>plucked from an ivory tower and thrown into the White House unwillingly.\n\nThe opposite is true. The first lady has brought a remarkable degree of grace, dignity, and quiet strength to a position that, while unofficial, is steeped in tradition and significance for our country.\n\nShe is an extremely qualified and accomplished person on her own merits, and has expressed her delight and desire to serve in the capacity as first lady.\n\nHere are the first lady's top moments of her first year in the position:\n\n    Inauguration: The president's inauguration was her first official event, and all eyes were on her during the historic event. She aced it. The world of fashion is important for those in such high-profile positions. Fashion can be wielded as a tool to send a message, to honor, and to subtly make a point. Mrs. Trump instantly drew comparisons to another young, stylish, well-versed, and private first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy. Unlike Mrs. Kennedy, Mrs. Trump does not enjoy the adoration of the press, no matter how much credit or appreciation she deserves.\n\n    Overseas tours with the president: Even those in the media opposed to the president generally agreed that the first lady handled herself in a way that was dignified, elegant, and worthy of praise on the world stage during high-profile trips to the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. Mrs. Trump's fashion choices were significant and well thought out, and her compassion was on full display in Rome. She met with several groups of children, and also confirmed she is indeed a Roman Catholic after meeting with Pope Francis. These trips also highlighted her knowledge of multiple foreign languages\u2014French, German, Serbian, and Slovenian.\n\n     Hurricane Harvey: Many naysayers prematurely thought that Hurricane Harvey would become the president's mismanaged 'Hurricane Katrina.' The opposite occurred. The president and federal officials coordinated as expertly as possible during a natural disaster with state and local officials. Often overlooked, the first lady and Karen Pence, the wife of the vice president, returned to Texas together to offer support and witness the recovery process firsthand. She made a relatable pit stop at the well-known local favorite, Whataburger, which became a hit on Twitter.\n\n    Bringing Christmas back: During the 2016 presidential campaign, one of Donald Trump's favorite promises was to bring back widespread public recognition of Christmas. 'We will say \u2018Merry Christmas!' he would frequently shout to the crowds, receiving ecstatic cheers while striking a blow against political correctness. The president certainly accomplished his goal. And the first lady actually brought Christmas back into the White House. The first family sent out an elegant Christmas card and also created an official 'first family' gold ornament, prominently featuring 'Christmas at the White House' inscribed at the bottom.\n\nSee also:  [LINK] ",

First Lady, I think you have a good heart, a bright mind and a gracious spirit even to the downtrodden.

Now for the first time in 10 years North Korea's going to come to the table and negotiate with the United States of America and well this is always a tedious usually unproductive event.

That alone would cause anyone major depression... but no, I think mom manages to protect him a lot. , and he may we.l be the quiet reserved child,probably disgusted with adult world of politics. It has been totally disgusting, the total smears, destructive behaviour of Democrats who can't stand the fact that he outsmarted their 'arrogant, devoid of any integrity , smears, schemes and \nLands'! In my view Democrats are bordering being  , if not already, treason, by continued effort to overthrow him, wit<b> h witc</b>h hunt of concocted by corrupt  Dems /Russian dossier, which they themselves are guilty of. This is treason, and subversion, and I hope judiciary will have guts to prosecute the bunch of traitors.. in the meanwhile the man is doing excellent job, which is what he was voted in for, not for some alleged one night stand long before he was President. You dishonor the office of President, ( not surprising since Bill Clinton o wards) , and world is watching people like you and is disgusted, with YOUR disrespect of your own President. The reflection is on YOU,  not him! . This would not be tolerated anywhere else, in name of free speech. You can keep your free speech, if you don't know how to use it honorably. leave President and family alone. Their private lives is their own! All families have periods of stress and they surely weather pre and post election very well.",

The famous John Kenndy speach of, ask not what ur country can do 4 u, but what can u do 4 ur contury. That speach was not written by Kenndy. Michell should of had the class 2 admit she didnt wright the speach eather. But she didnt, instead she took the credit 4 it. While making Malonia look foolish. Only after the truth came out about the true writer of the speach months later. Then Michelle Obama admitted she didnt write the speach. That's <b> tacky,</b> rude & self serving & low class. If the true writer of the speach hadnt came forward 2 help Milonia out. Michell was very comfortable letting people believe she wrote it. I feel she is a<b>  racist</b> & she lied while giving a speach @ a college. About some 1 thought she was a worker @ the white house. I believe she said she was mistaken 4 the help. That's a blainten lie & she should have been called out on it. Prove it, who said it, when & where, day & time? The person that mistaked her 4 the help must had bee<b> n blin</b>d. That's 2 lies, what else has she lie about. Bill Clinton did more<b>  4 bla</b>ck people then Michelle & Barack put 2gether. That's y people call Bill Clonton the <b> 1st bl</b>ack president. These comments can all b proven just look in 2 it. Self centered people with huge EGO'S have delusions of grandeur have no problem taking credit 4 any thing. It comes naturally 2 them. She once said on TV she was Baraks equal. That showed she is a EGOTIST that is above others & could bcome a president of the USA with right now with no trading cuz she is equal 2 a sitting president.",

Melania became a US citizen in 2005, five years (as the law requires) after she obtained her US Permanent Residence through an EB-1 Visa Petition.  She petitioned her parents' US permanent residence according to law, as parents of a US citizen, and they have just recently become US citizens. There is no mystery about Melania's immigration status and she never violated her visa status, as others posting here suggest. There is no reason to criticize or demean her for being foreign born.",

Usually in the sciences etc. As a model she would have had to show some exceptional talent in her field. The fact that her immigration attorney worked for Trump speaks loud & clear to me.  If you have the money you can make it happen. No way she went from visitor visa to permanent resident just like that. Of course neither you nor I have proof because the whitehouse/attorneys won't release her immigration papers. How convenient.",

Melania came to the USA on a visitor visa, which as you point out disallows work; however when an agency signed her she changed status to H-1B, which is an employment authorized visa. She then applied for permanent residence as an EB-1 which was granted. She applied for US citizenship five years later, as the law allows. If she had worked illegally, as you allege, she would have been ineligible for permanent residence. That was not the case. The proof, my friend, is in the pudding. If you disagree, take it up with the US Citizenship and Immigration Service. Now it looks like you are the \"foolish one\".",

She has character and all the innuendos about being a \"gold digger\" only serve to degrade those who make such childish comments. Is every wife of every wealthy man (or vice versa) a gold digger? And if so, what does that make the rest of the population who marry mediocrity . . . like the ones calling Melania names? What are YOU . . . ? I'll tell you what; you're LOSERS. Melania wins.

Melania is a very strong women who has to endure all types of critics. In my opinion I believe she shows real character for putting up with Donald Trump. I do not doubt she is putting Barron's interests above her own. That shows devotion to ensuring Barron doesn't have to be scarred by a messy divorce. If anything, Melania should be shown more compassion for enduring Donald's me first attitude, humiliating her in front of the media and the public. At 47 yrs <b> old </b>she will probably outlive Donald. Until then we should show compassion for having to put up with, as Kim Jong Un rightfully called Donald, a dotard.",

She is useless as a \"first lady\"....but I cannot imagine that any amount of money would make marriage to that disgusting pig acceptable.  NOW, she has to consider her son.  He looks too much like the imbecile to think that he'll escape unscathed, but hopefully, she can get custody.  Public photos suggest that there is no love between Melania and the dumdum,  and I assume that she will leave him as soon as her contract runs out (or he enacts some \"you're too <b> old </b>now\" clause in their pre-nup).  She seems like a decent enough person (who made a YOUGE mistake).  I wish her well.",

We all know why she married Trump. He happens to have a thing for eastern Europeans. His next wife will be russian.",

Liberals can't bash her enough, because hating is what they do best.  Liberals are so jealous, they bleed through their eyeballs.  There is no merit to their  hateful accusations, but that doesn't stop them.....  Obama and Michelle were the laziest and most incompetent, classless couple to ever set foot in White House.  He is just as much a narcissist as they claim Trump to be.  We watched Obama's hateful and<b>  racist</b> actions, while we see Trump working non stop to be the best he can for our country and it's citizens.

Bush alive and well, he IS NOT a Jr. His father's name is George Herbert Walker Bush, his name is George Walker Bush - no Herbert. Regarding your \"facts\" about Bill and Hillary Clinton, I would laugh were were it not for the fact that you, and millions of others actually believe all of that bullshit - SAD!  Please provide the source of your \"facts\".  My guess is that it is one, or a combination, of Fox television programming, Breitbart, Rush Limbaugh, Alex Jones or some other alt-right publication. Some months back, and recently republished, Snopes.com had a very long article that completely de-bunked many of the bullshit incidents you have attributed to the Clintons and/or the Clinton Foundation. Included in the Snopes article were the facts regarding every one of the 30+ \"murderers\" which have also been attributed to the Clintons by all of you Clinton-haters and other conspiracy theorists. Another Hillary famous \"crime\" in the article that was also de-bunked is that of the Uranium One deal. Although it's one you did not mention in your comment, I don't doubt that you accept the lies being circulated about the deal, so I included in my reply. As for Bill fathering an illegitimate <b> black </b>child, the only time I've seen that particular lie was in the FICTIONAL account of Bill's first presidential bid. The book, Primary Colors (I believe that's the name) was authored by Anonymous as a book then, made into a movie. Please pay attention: it was a FICTIONAL story.\nIn the future, you would be better served if you would check your facts with one of the sites that are unbiased. There are at least 4 sites, maybe more. Unfortunately, at present, the only two names I can think of are Snopes and Politico.",

I'm David Mayer de Rothschild, and my uncle and my family run the central World banking system. I'll let you in on a bloody Secret, we did loan him 314 million dollars from our Deutsche Bank in Germany. during the election  to set up and to broker to deal with the Russians to build a hotel casino in Russia. And then president Trump, telling the American people he has <b> nothing </b>to do with the Russians. Is a sign of dishonesty and lies. He is a international businessman, he has resorts in Dubai he has resorts in Switzerland he has a resort in Scotland, why doesn't he say the truth to the American people?",

            "commentText": "Trump \"professes\" to be a christian therefore I'm posting my comment with that in mind. He put himself up for examination when he invoked prayer from that group of so-called spiritual leaders in main stream \"christianity\". None of them were brave enough to share the truth with Mr. Trump regarding divorce and remarriage because they had an agenda.\n\nI know that the word endemic is used to describe diseases, but in this case I take the liberty to describe divorce as being endemic in christianity. Serious diseases, if  mistreated or left untreated can kill you.\n\nDivorcing ones' spouse and remarrying another, while the first is alive, assures the guilty will face the judgment, eternal death. While you have life on this side of eternity, the only remedy/cure is repentance [leave the illegal marriage], which unfortunately the majority will not do, even in my own family.\n\nBecause of the lack of sound doctrinal teaching, many people are offended when the topic of divorce is raised (it doesn't help when false teachers get into the ears of those who do not hold to Scripture). Yes, Elohim hates divorce, it tears a family apart and the children are the ones who suffer the most.\n\nBut read the Word, it doesn't condemn the divorced, but rather gives instruction as to how not to commit the sin that will damn you to eternal separation: The sin of remarrying while your spouse  is alive.\n\nMarriage is honorable in every respect; and, in particular, <b> sex </b>within marriage is pure. But Elohim will indeed punish fornicators and adulterers. Heb 13:4 \n\n Thus a married<b>  woman</b> is *bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives; but if her husband dies, she is discharged from the law concerning the husband. Romans 7:2\n*Some of you christians will say \"we're no longer under the law...But it's under the law where divorce was permitted: Some Pharisees approached Him, and tested Him, saying, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause whatever?\" Mat 19:3 \n\nHe answered, \"Moshe allowed you to divorce your wives because your hearts are so hardened. But this is not how it was at the beginning\". Mat 19:8  \n\n Therefore, while the husband is alive, she will be called an adulteress if she marries another man; but if the husband dies, she is free from that part of the Torah; so that if she marries another man, she is not an adulteress. Rom 7:3 \n\n \"It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Torah. \u00a0\"Anyone who divorces his wife and marries anothe<b> r woma</b>n commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorc<b> ed wom</b>an commits adultery.\" Yeshua haMashiyach. Luke 16:17-18\n\n But even if she does depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband is not to divorce his wife. 1 Corinthians 7:11\n\nThe Word does not pronounce judgment on the divorced, but rather on ADULTERERS - those who divorce and remarry while their spouse is still living - Luke 16:17-18\u00a0\n\nMany are quick to refer to Matthew 19:9 as grounds to divorce their spouse, but remember that the Tanakh was the only Scripture that Yeshua and the disciples were referencing.\n\nSo to understand Matthew 19:9, you must look at Deuteronomy 22 and 24 explaining what is marriage, divorce and remarriage.\n\nRightly dividing the Word you will find that a lot of what people think is Truth is merely speculation, myth. Like the Pharisees, they look for any reason to end a marriage even after many years. So they look for \"teachers\" who will tickle their ears, like those false teachers who gathered around Mr. Trump.\n\n\u00a0 For the time is coming when PEOPLE WILL NOT PUT UP WITH SOUND DOCTRINE [THE WORD], BUT HAVING ITCHING EARS, THEY WILL ACCUMULATE FOR THEMSELVES TEACHERS TO SUIT THEIR OWN DESIRES [FOR WHAT IS FORBIDDEN], and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander away to myths. 2 Timothy 4:3-4\n\nTo the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn. Isa 8:20\n \nMarriage is honorable in every respect; and, in particul<b> ar, </b>sex within marriage is pure. But Elohim will indeed punish fornicators and adulterers. Heb 13:4 \n\nPS: Anyone who teaches contrary to the Scriptures is a false teacher, not because I said so but because the Word says so. How can he be a man of Elohim by breaking Elohim's commandments and teach others to do so?",

She only attended university for one week, but she was claiming 'she finished it', the university made her take it down.\nIn Slovenia they have ads for language schools featuring a photo of Melania saying \"just imagine how far you can go with a little bit of English\".  Seemingly she was dubbing into soft porn already. And 'supermodel LOL not a chance. She was and is a <b> nobody.</b>  And she is not 5'11\". She is merely 5'9\".\n\nThe most laughable part is when she is tooting her morals: she didn't want to give DJT her number because he was with a date. LOL But it didn't bother her that he is married. Nuff said.\nI don't understand Trumps: everything has to be exaggerated to such extreme that becomes laughable. Why not to say devoted wife, and even that would be a stretch.",

Reportedly, the engagement ring's price was 1.5 million and Donald Trump claimed to have received a \"six-figure discount\", which was a lie. In a statement from chairman Laurence Graff, seller of the ring, to Forbes Magazilne, Graff revealed Trump never received the discount he claimed he had. Graff called Trump 'a pleasure to do business with,' adding, 'no favours' were awarded to him.\" Check it out at https://www.wmagazine.com/story/melania-trump-engagement-ring-actual-price.",

Would you want to be with a bastard like that. She is taking the humiliations because of his money.",

In my view, Melania Trump need to lose her citizenship and if it doesn't then our government needs to pass out citizenship to every illegal that been in the U.S. as long as Melania  been here including the Dreamers.",

He is soooo eager to show the world that he is the \"master of the deal\" that he will LIE about it on every level and at ANY OPPORTUNITY.  THE MAN IS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR!!!    He LIED and told the world he got a 50% discount on the ring in exchange for \"promotion\" of the jeweler....BOTH LIES!!!  He paid full price and there was NO promotion agreement.  There is NO JUSTIFICATION to be made about TRUMP'S expectation that people would just \"swallow\" without question everything he claims....OR that a jeweler would sell a two million dollar ring at half price to a guy who claims to be as wealthy as Donald Trump.  People step forward ALL THE TIME about the lies and corruption of TRUMP.....but his supporters just do not care.  This is just ONE MORE BLATANT EXAMPLE!!!  THE SO-CALLED POTUS HAS NO INTEGRITY...HE IS A NARCISSIST AND A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR...AND THE TRUMPIES WHO SUPPORT HIM ARE OK ABOUT THAT.\n\nYOU could have figured that out for YOURSELF.  YOU should care about the integrity of the guy YOU PEOPLE put in office (but only with the help of the electoral college).  YOU PEOPLE should have stopped yelling FAKE FAKE FAKE during the campaign and FACT-CHECKED this guy!!!  YOU NEVER DID......and you don't now.",

Did you do it for love did you do it for money I don't know how jealous are you of Trump's third wife you know she made 8.8 million dollars all on her own. People from foreign lands are kind of a trip you ever been to France. In France if you see a little boy coming out of his apartment cuz he's going to go do something with another little boy they always hold hands they always hold hands. Turns out they're not <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>it is a custom. All little boys hold hands. Yeah I can see why you think Trump's wife doesn't love him . I don't understand it he doesn't treat her like she's some kind of moron that has to be watched every minute so she doesn't fall down and hurt herself or get lost. And where's the constant incessant public displays of affection you know the ones you used to get when you were 13 or 14 but have since growing out of. Yeah they can't possibly love each other something they didn't tell you about on those films a couple times not many I've seen her look at Donald when he was facing away and smile what do you think that means sweetie",

Trump needs a beautiful <b> woman </b>to be seen in public with, after all just having a billion dollars doesn't mean that you can have eye candy on your arm every night. That's why he needed to have a Sham marriage. Read that over again . Trump can have a beautiful<b>  woman</b> on his arm every night what does he need  a Sham marriage for sweetie. Think about this if it doesn't make any sense then it's probably not true. Does Trump want a beautifu<b> l woma</b>n yes. Can Trump live the fantasy of having a different beautif<b> ul wom</b>an every night He could if I wanted to I suppose. Instead he got married, why?  it's a sham marriage He doesn't really like it but wow sweetie. Why? Would he put up with it ?    The answer he likes being with her. Howard Hughes used to have beautiful women stashed all over the city. He didn't love any of them they were just <b> for </b>sex. If Trump didn't love her why would he have her around. Lot of redundancy in this post unfortunately I felt it was needed",

If that was true why didn't he marry a American Girl that worked two jobs to put herself through college so everybody would admire her as a hard-working American Girl. Trump doesn't sleep 8 hours at a time. He usually wakes up watching some TV and Twitter's. If that's how your husband slept you wouldn't sleep in the same bed he did or he would wake you up every night when you were trying to sleep. Trump is rich he can afford two bedrooms too nice beds. I also am a Restless sleeper and was married forever she never appreciated getting woke up after 3 hours so logically we had two beds I would get up and go in the living room and read. If Trump married her just for show why did he marry a foreign born <b> woman </b>who apparently was a model who had pictures of herself nude. I don't feel any animosity towards his wife or the country she came from but she sure wouldn't have been first choice for hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans. If you wanted a trophy wife he sure could have had one born in America and blonde. His trophy wife would have acted a lot better in public. She would have gained him a lot more admiration and votes. I have no idea if she's in love with Trump but I'm pretty sure at the very least he's infatuated with her. Trump travels a lot he has his own plane and leaves that comes home at odd hours and interestingly enough I have a sister the Flies all over the world commercial funny thing she almost has to make an appointment to spend time with her husband. Since she goes way out of her way to spend time with him it doesn't seem to be a major issue in their marriage. Also voting gos state by state in this country we've never had a Countrywide popular vote as far back as George Washington you should read about our voting system it's fascinating.",

If you ever go to France you might think that all the little boys are <b> gay<b> .</b</b>> When one goes over to have a playdate when his friend comes out of the house they shake hands and then walk down the street holding hands. I thought for the longest time there was gays in the neighborhood I was at. It turns out they're no<b> t g<b> a</b</b>>y it's a custom. The other possibility she has affection for him but keeps him on a short leash because he's an a******. And the third possibility like half the marriages in America it's on the rocks and they're going to end up splitting up. Is it the custom of her culture not to show affection in public. If you go to Finland and you see people hugging they're tourist. Fins don't show public affection. So out of the three which is it. To the many people that are divorced and reading this post you're going to be sure they're soon-to-be-divorced. To the  people from Finland reading this post they are going to think what a poor bunch of perverts what do they want for her to do play with his penis in public. And for us people that were married all our life but only showed affection in public on special occasions we think it's sad you went through such bad marriages. I find it amusing that you would pick out somebody and say their marriage isn't working when in this country everyday millions are planning on divorce. So Trump's one of them big deal. Her culture doesn't believe in displaying public affection big deal. I can quite imagine only their close friends know which it is and I'm pretty sure that doesn't include you",

Watch a movie called\"Emperor New Clothing\"  that might be your level of comprehension it explains it very well. Both sides are shown there is the side of fools that will not speak the truth such as the Emperor and all his advisories for being afraid they might be wrong.

I do enjoy a good fable now and then, because they do teach us so much about life and people's character traits.  A good fable is really just using animals to make the message point because it is easier for a person  to look at the animal and not take it personally. There are a few authors over the time of history that have written stories using humans to make their point of how adults act in the disguise of Children's Tale. This is because as an adult we do not want to admit that we are vain or greedy or just stupid.",

I also am not a party person I want to win as you pointed out the one person that will do what is best for the people of this country and the planet. Like you I have known of Trump for some time, since the 70\"s for me and it has never been anything good. This ICEICEBABY will never listen to what you say because if everything you give him for evidence is thrown out as fake he will never see the truth the only thing he has left to go by is the real fake. During the Korea War there was a radio <b> woman </b>that broadcasted to the masses<b>  nothing</b> but lies, telling how an American  ship had been blown up or something and everyone thought they were hearing the truth it was the only news they had to listen to so it was understandable they would be lead astray. Now a days we have the internet we have bloggers from other countries all reporting on America. There is so much info out there and a person only needs to research if they really wanted the truth. But you must be open to saying that you are wrong when you find it. That is the problem too many of Trumps supporters have. They only have their pride (most are at or below poverty level, most have a high school or GED education and very few have a college degree) their value of what they think a person should be and admitting that you are wrong about something is not part of that package and Trump never admits he is wrong he is the Jesus or mohammed of what a person should be.

Very few friends from Arkansas attended their wedding on October 11, 1975, way before politics put them in the limelight, and way before Donald Trump would ever have known them at that time.\n\nYou are clearly a malicious Trump-hater, choosing to believe, without any evidence, the lies of the Clintons, Globalists, Liberals, Communists, Muslim Brothehood, CAIR, BLM, Soros, and especially the Banker-types who are promoting the New World Order, desiring to disarm America so they can -- just like Adolpf Hitler did -- subjugate the American people.  If they succeed, no one's life will be safe; you disagree with them and you will be shot.\nThe President is not a <b> \"tramp</b>.\"  He is the duly-elected President, who kept the Cover-up Queen from taking her throne.

Every time I have heard her (try and speak) english she didn't seem very bright. Maybe in her native tongue she sounds more intellectual. She plagiarized Michelle O's speech. She said she would focus on CyberBullying: Really? Her husband is a known unfaithful pig, yet she desperately wanted to marry him. She is an idiot.",
