Throughout the past 10,000 years it has been determined that sex is not an interchangeable feature. In the absence of modern science people who believed this were absolutely right, but now we have the science to make a person's sex interchangeable. If a person is able to replace their reproductive and endocrine systems (or whatever other systems are associated with sex) with those of the opposite sex then it's factually correct to state that they have successfully changed sexes. You are a male and anyone who tries to deny that is wrong. I'm a guy btw and I feel like it is a ton better than being a woman. I don't have to deal with so many dirty and painful experiences and I fully support your decision to become a man. Congrats bro",

I have no fucking clue what a real woman is anymore. And not to be rude or anything. But I like my women fertile. And not men with inverted penises and testicles. As not being able to have children is a real deal stopper to many men. I have a huge fucking problem with trannies because they think they can go to the dating market as if they were the opposite gender, when in reality they are being dishonest from the get go. When dating, a transexual needs to say what they were born like to avoid problems when things get intimate. If we can bypass this big issue for me, then we can agree, they can be called whatever the fuck they want. (as long as it's she or he, I won't be using made up words for made up \"genders\")",

I am sure you have been told a million times or heard a million negative things in regards to the changes you have made in your life. After reading some of the comments, I felt sick.  I have a friend who went through this same process and it was an amazing experience watching him become himself, and find happiness, who is now married to a wonderful women! Although, I do not exactly understand what it is to feel like I am in the wrong body, or born the wrong gender - I can only imagine - I have great respect for you taking these steps to become the person you intended to be. I hope your journey in life brings you all that you hope for! - Congrats",

Men and women are not blank slates learned by society to act the way we do, we are two very dimorphic genders that have patterns and brainwaves that makes us unique. I can tell you're emotional, I can smell your female way of being as a groundwork for who you are, and this will never go away. This is especially obvious in male -> female surgery. It's easy to spot a male to female transperson, you can sense him from far away. This begs the question, is it better to be a rejected man than a real woman who deep down inside wants to be a boy. \n\nWhy do you think transpeople suicide rates are so high, when they change they will never fit in, and once they have they can never change back. Transpeople are chasing a dream it's impossible to achieve.",

We need to help these people understand the reality of things, taking testosterone to look like a man, even when you are a girl should not be the celebrated phenomenon it is the media and western countries.  Homosexuals probably wouldn't care, but people like this will start attracting heterosexuals, and in the case of men, things can become pretty violent. A man finding out his girlfriend is a estrogen induced biological male could become a very dangerous situation.",

Violence is not the answer  and there should be absolutely nothing dangerous about a situation like that. I absolutely can‚Äôt believe how shockingly horrific your comment is.

I need a mental health check because I consider the fact that a fake woman sleeping with a biological male can turn violent? Did I suggest it should turn violent, or simply that it will, naturally? It turns out to be the latter, now what the hell does that have to do with my mental health, you cretin? You libtard progressives fully present your illogical thoughts and opinions in all their infamous tyranny. A man dating or even sleeping with a fake woman could easily turn violent, this man was taken advantage of by another man who tricked him into buying his female appearance. This can be considered rape, do you understand that? And in the right circumstances, even a decent man can go ape shit and harm or kill this fake woman that tricked him. The same goes for fake men that trick biological women, there are many transgender deaths that occur due to these problems, but of course not all the time. When did I say violence is the answer? And that is bullshit, toddler  logic. If violence wasn't the answer, we wouldn't have established militaries  across the world to defend our countries, and police in the streets to uphold the law and protect the civilians. I call them for what they are, a man is a man, a woman is a woman,  if one changes their appearance artificially to sate their mental state and their paranoia, then yes, that is disgusting. A man that is now a woman, is disgusting. A woman that is now a man, is disgusting. You don't think so? You think its great? Fine, that's your opinion, just don't pretend like you are the  golden standard of acceptance and moral understanding when you decide to cheer on these mentally deranged individuals. These people need serious help, not in the form of holding their hand to make  their fantasy appear like reality. This disappointment in humanity is me? How? I am trying to uphold the evolutionary and scientific concept of men being men and women being women,   not women turning to men and man to women. This is real life, not a circus act, people like you that are cheering on these folk, instead of helping them understand that they could potentially ruin their life permanently, are doing no service to humanity, you are devolving humanity.",

The second and in my opinion strongest effect on his body is the strong bodyhair growth. His voice got also deeper. I just wanted to say that his body didn't change in the way you think.

You missed my point however, The rates in witch trans people kill themselves does not change Pre or after hormones and surgery, Meaning its not effective at anything in the vast majority of cases. As well as costing tax payers a large amount of money for cosmetic/Non necessary surgery. Giving someone who is mentally Ill the ability to change their body is not a good idea. And i refuse to believe something that comes with a minimum of 50% mortality rate is not an illness. that 50% comes from the best cases btw. They need help, not a knife. and sure as fucking hell not a knife under 21.",

It's their decision after all. It's not as black and white as you think. \n\n\"Because tax payers paying for said surgery's when they should be classified as cosmetic is fine right? \"\nIn almost all countries, it's not free at all. You still need to pay it yourself. This is generally the case with cosmetic surgeries. \n\n\"Because giving parents permission to change their childrens body's before they have even gone half way through puberty is harmless right?\" \nI don't think there has been any evidence that someone has suddenly gotten attracted to the different gender after puberty. However there are kids who pretend to be straight until they are teens, then come out of the closet. Plus these children are carefully monitored and given counseling. It's not as easy as you think.\n\nIf you are fine with the surgery but not the age, then you should edit your original comment to reflect that.",

There's articles that have been written by people who have gender dysphoria themselves, and they say that they do in fact have depression, saying things like they feel like freaks and that they don't fit in, again, most likely attributed to comments just like these. Obviously not necessarily online, but irl too.\n\nOther articles written by psychologists themselves who say that people with gender dysphoria have more mental illnesses mostly due to the way they are treated.\n\nFuck, even I would be depressed if my parents thought I was a freak.",

How do you know the lives of every trans person who took their life? If the person is happy and harming no one else, then I really see no issue at all. In fact, speaking out about it like this guy is will make others like him feel more valid, which they should. People don't choose to be trans, it is just how they are, so yes it should be normalised to the point where we don't have to have discussions like this, we could just accept.

Look at the suicide rates for gay people back then, they were much higher then, when more people were homophobic, than they are now.  It‚Äôs the same with trans people right now, once other people see transgenderism as normal suicide rates will drop.  This is because of discrimination.  \n\nAnd if you guys wanna pull that ‚ÄúI had 2 trans friends kill themselves becuz for some reason AFTER transitioning I feel depressed as fuck because I feel as if I am a man or woman which is totally related to suicide rates,‚Äù I‚Äôll give you an actual example of someone who I know in real life.  They were born female and transitioned to male.  When they told their parents, their parents agreed to help them transition.  When the parents broke the news to the grandparents, the grandparents were in fucking tears and unhappy as fuck.  They transitioned, but they loved knowing that their grandparents as well as society would look down on them.  This made him stay stuck in his room for a while until years later he finally got the confidence and self-assurance to go out and be himself.  \n\nThis is what transphobia does.  Had his parents and brother looked down on him he probably would have killed himself.  This is why we need to be more accepting, so that trans people don‚Äôt fucking go through depression and commit suicide.",

Here are statistics of LGB suicide rates from 2015, 3 years ago.  http://www.suicidology.org/Portals/14/Re-Formatted%20LGB%20Youth%202016%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf?ver=2016-11-16-105952-633\n\nOver 60% of LGB people have thought about suicide.  Imagine if this was 2000, these percentages would be way higher.\n\nTrans people having a 40% suicide attempt rate at this time is not unrealistic as they are only just now becoming more accepted within society.  This source states that the main reasons for these suicide statistics in just LGB people is homophobia/discrimination.  The fact that trans people are more oppressed than LGB people nowadays would make sense that trans suicide rates are this high, right?\n\nAlso gay suicide statistics back then are extremely similar to trans suicide rates now.  So what‚Äôs your point?  No where near as high?  Horseshit.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a problem with you if everyone you know hates you and you kill yourself.‚Äù  Okay, tell that to the kids who get bullied and kill themselves.  Or parents who verbally abuse their kids.  Is there something wrong with these kids?  Do they have mental illnesses too? http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/bullying-and-suicide.html\n\nIf everyone fucking hates you I bet you would be sad about it.

Newer data shows that plenty of those who transition get improved quality of life. \nhttps://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/trgh.2015.0008\n\nA lot of people also take said study out of context, this is a very important part;\n\nFor the purpose of evaluating the safety of sex reassignment in terms of morbidity and mortality, however, it is reasonable to compare sex reassigned persons with matched population controls. The caveat with this design is that transsexual persons before sex reassignment might differ from healthy controls (although this bias can be statistically corrected for by adjusting for baseline differences). It is therefore important to note that the current study is only informative with respect to transsexuals persons health after sex reassignment; no inferences can be drawn as to the effectiveness of sex reassignment as a treatment for transsexualism. In other words, the results should not be interpreted such as sex reassignment per se increases morbidity and mortality. Things might have been even worse without sex reassignment. As an analogy, similar studies have found increased somatic morbidity, suicide rate, and overall mortality for patients treated for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.[39], [40] This is important information, but it does not follow that mood stabilizing treatment or antipsychotic treatment is the culprit.\n\nhttp://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/827713\n\nLargest study to date.\n\nAt entry into the study (baseline), the most common comorbidity in both groups was depression, with a 24.9% incidence in MTF subjects and 13.6% in FTM, according to Dr. Asscheman. He noted, however, that the frequency of depression varied greatly among the study centers. Even after treatment, 26 (2.4%) of the MTF subjects and 7 (1.4%) of the FTM subjects still reported depression, leading Dr. Asscheman to tell the large audience, \"Sex-reassignment treatment does not cure depression.\"\n\nThat'd be about 90% decrease of depression, even if the clinical illness in itself can obviously never be fully cured.\n\nWe also know that people who are treated for dysphoria early and who are allowed to grow up in the gender of affirmation have suicide rates no higher than the control group (again, suicide seems to be more related to prejudice and discrimination against trans people, not their transition situation).\n\nhttp://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958\n\nTransition isn‚Äôt magical, isn‚Äôt easy, and doesn‚Äôt solve every problem transgender people face. Unemployment rates in the transgender population are significantly higher than what the general population faces, along with elevated rates of discrimination, harassment and violence.\nThe data tells us that the best ways we can reduce the transgender suicide rate are by affirming the identities of transgender people and providing safe and supportive environments. A supporting family has again and again been shown to correlate highly with reduced transgender suicidality.\n\nBut, TL;DR, while transitioning will not always completely fix a person for life, it CLEARLY does help in many, MANY cases and in the end it's a decision trans people themselves make for the sake of easing their dysphoria. \nNow, gender dysphoria shouldn't be normalized as something that is \"cool\" or \"special\", because it's a genuine mental condition, and it's shitty as all hell. It's the source of anxieties and depression because one cannot stand seeing themselves in a body where they feel they do not belong. And hormones are also NOT easy to deal with, but in the end, it could also save your life depending on how much dysphoria you're struggling with.\n\nHowever the fact that trans people exist and are just trying to live their lives like any other person SHOULD be normalized. \n\nIf a transgender person wants to go ahead and take the risk in hopes of a better life, then let them be. Discrimination doesn't help their case.",

Straight people dont care about LGBT people and they dont have a problem with them, they have a problem when they start to normalize their conditions. Whats next? Autism is normal? Pedophilia? After all pedophiles are not mentally sick, they think like normal people and are capable of independence, but they have certain sexuall drives towards kids, they were born that way and had no choice in the matter, so should we normalize pedophilia? I think not.\n LGBT people are not pedophilles, i know, but they have similar disorders none of which are normal and none of them chose to be born that way. Its just that pedophilles disorder makes them a predator. So its seen as not normal and LGBT is suddenly becoming normal just because its not predatory...they are both abnormalities.",

There‚Äôs a difference between sex and gender, sex being your physical attributes (genitals, xy or xx chromosomes, etc) and gender being the way you identify. Just because they‚Äôre basically still female doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt identify as male. There‚Äôs a lot to take into consideration here. We‚Äôre humans, not animals, nothing is black and white and in the end, basic human decency is to let people be who they want to be. (So long as they‚Äôre not hurting anyone.)",

As not being able to have children is a real deal stopper to many men.\n\nI have a huge fucking problem with trannies because they think they can go to the dating market as if they were the opposite gender, when in reality they are being dishonest from the get go.\n\nWhen dating, a transexual needs to say what they were born like to avoid problems when things get intimate.\n\n\nIf we can bypass this big issue for me, then we can agree, they can be called whatever the fuck they want. (as long as it's she or he, I won't be using made up words for made up \"genders\")\n\nBecause let's be honest, if a man finds out he's been making out with a tranny when before he thought he was a woman, there is a big chance that tranny is getting his shit beat the fuck out of him.

Or at least it's best for them to go to a dating site that's welcome to lgbtq+.\n\nIf some man beats the shit out of a trans woman just because they made out, that's on him for being transphobic. Trans women are women, and trans men are men. Maybe not 100% biologically, but who cares?? All trans people are different, some have the entire full surgery, and some don't. there's always adoption, and if you dont want to date someone because their trans for the sake of not being able to have biological children, then that's fine too, but it's best to be nice about it.",

We all know it's your opinion, and I can blatantly get behind defending one's opinion, this is a little different than you think.

I have a friend who told me their story, in which before they realized how they identified they hated absolutely everything about their body. Their voice, their natural curves, their eyes, their jaw, their hair, the way they walked, the stereotypes of their gender, you fucking name it, they had a literal anxiety attack over it. It was devasting to their mental health. \nOnly when they realized they were trans did things change. \nThey did what they could to be more like who they wanted to be physically, and they're still waiting it out before they can finally get testosterone. \nThey're fighting a literal mental health issue because they identify as male and not female. They're dealing with it and taking the criticism. Most of them won't fuck with Transphobic people because they know it's useless, but I'm proud to back them up.\nI'm also proud to say that ever since I've accepted the fact that I'm genderfluid my life has gotten so much easier.

Doesn't matter whether that waste is of talents  (intelligence, wisdom, strength, knowledge, kindness, beauty, happiness, etc...) or material goods and services. Humanity is not a new thing and human happiness is not something that hasn't been explored in great depth and breadth. I know that you think that your pervertions are cute and new, novel and innovative, but there truly is nothing new under the sun. It has all been tried before. What you are advocating herein has a long and miserable track record that you think you can change with rainbows and unicorns and singing whatever the new version of Kumbaya is.\n\nTo any sane person the waste in human potential, beauty, happiness, productivity, increase, and so many more things of value, is stark and overwhelming. You think that everybody that opposes what you advocate is mean and unfeeling when in reality we feel more and deeper than those who have become past feeling. We mourn daily and agonize over the great misery being forced upon the world by an extremely militant and rabid minority that have managed to deceive many good people into buying their lies by attaching their fallacious arguments to things everybody is for. It is no different than those who are pro-murdering-babies re-badging as being for choice and a woman's body and her rights to it being respected when in reality the entirety of the issue is whether a woman has a right to murder a baby before it is born in a certain and specific way. You do not support diversity, human rights, nor individual identity you advocate the destruction of these things if not solely a Stalinesque partisan brand of such that pretends not to know it rabidly seeks to deprive others of choice, diversity, rights, identity etc...\n\nBut I'll leave it at this. It won't work. You will never find true and lasting happiness down this road (the real hard truth as to why deviants have such a hankering for suicide). You will only find sorrow and the endless pursuit of some new strange and winding path that you can prove to those of us clinging to the straight and narrow is a shortcut and have your long sought for vindication. You will forever remain lost and wandering while hacking brush away from the obvious traditional source your own conscience once told you about (you remember, back before you shouted it down into submission and became past feeling).\n\nGod is loving and so am I but that does not presuppose acceptance of, nor the promotion of misery. Never has, never will. Any and every good father will ceaselessly promote the true path to happiness to his posterity in whatever manner best suits its acceptance without causing additional waste and misery. Sometimes the carrot, sometimes the stick. At this point however when you are trying to take over the commons and indoctrinate youth into your miserable hoard the stick is absolutely the order of the day, the stakes are too high.\n\nSo yeah she should have waited and found the right guy to pursue all of her human potential with. That's not mean it is the nicest thing anybody could say given the ramifications (which is why that's what I led with and left it to before engaging you lot).",

I am very sorry that you are this ignorant to this matter. Being gay/transgender is not a choice or preference, it is just somebody being themselves. I really do not think this is a healthy mindset and the amount of people in the LGBT community falling into depression and suicide due to mindsets like this is scary. I do not want to have an argument or make anybody feel bad, just find it scary that we live in a world of the future and are still being dragged back by things like this. Poker Face was simply leaving a kind comment trying to be kind to somebody and instead they are granted by and onslaught of harassment. Please, do some research - and respect people for who they are! Mindsets like these are dangerous. Once again I don't want to offend anybody!",

So I don't understand this \"but muh biological gender\" bullshit. It doesn't even make sense to call him \"she\" and you wouldn't do it in person, so why not help him find comfort in his life and call him \"he\", when you would do it anyways?

Why does it matter to you if he's a woman or a man, as long as I am not forced to call someone by a made-up pronoun nobody uses, why bother? He looks and sounds like a dude, and that's the only information I need to determine how I call someone. \nIf you would just start to let people, that haven't forced you to do shit, live their own fucking lives, without calling them \"infertile abominations worthy of being studied in a lab\", then there would be one radical feminist, and one person that can be rightly called \"transphobe\" and used as fuel for feminist agenda, less.",

Not to mention the lifelong pain associated with anyone who's ever had surgery will tell you. I mean this is truly a mental illness what kind of person wakes up and decides, say I think I'll mutilate my sexual organs? WTF these parents should be in jail for child abuse.",

        "commentText": "Water Symbol¬† Sex cannot be changed by surgical operations. The term \"sex change operation\" is misleading.\n\nCosmetic surgery can alter the appearance of the genitalia, hormones can enlarge the male breasts and change hair distribution. Make-up artists can alter a male face into a pouting female one. These have changed your sex, haven't they? Actually, no they haven't. The only things that have changed are your name, title, appearance and dress. Even without surgery it may be difficult at times to differentiate male from female, with both sexes wearing their hair long and dressed in similar attire. Looking up their genes is one way of distinguishing their sex.\n\nIn the first place it is genes which determine our sex. We humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes ‚Äì one from the mother's ovum and one from the father's sperm in all our body cells. Genes (made of DNA) lie strung along our 23 pairs of chromosomes.\n\nChromosome-pairs numbers 1 to 22 are microscopically identical, but chromosome pair number 23 the so called sex chromosomes are different. In the female number 23 has two paired large X chromosomes (so called because they resemble the letter X). In the male number 23 has one X chromosome paired with one small Y chromosome. It is this variation that determines sex differentiation. The ovum produces X chromosomes only, while the sperm produces both X and Y varieties.\n\nOther factors are involved ‚Äì for example the steroid hormones and other hormones and enzymes, which play an important role in the later maturation of sex.\n\nClearly, no amount of surgery can change the 100 million million body cells to alter the chromosome combinations that determine our sex. So a sex change is impossible.",

It comes from the Latin 'norma' which was an instrument of measurement. Things in nature are typical or atypical. Homosexuality and transgenderism are atypical, but so are left-handedness or situs inversus. You can read \"On the Normal and the Pathological\" , a book written by French physician Georges Canguilhem. It's a very important book for philosophers and medicine practitioners. I'm not a biology student, I'm a student in biomedical research. It's a bit like medicine if you prefer, but it's aimed at doing research in a laboratory to make medicine go forward instead of directly providing care to people. I'm not American. I'm Belgian. Please read the links I posted if you want to understand transgenderism better.",

I still have to brush up on social sciences. What I can say is that \"male\" and \"female\" are biological realities, independent of human social representations, while \"man\" and \"woman\" are categories to which humans culturally attach certain qualities. But those qualities aren't always based on biological realities. Therefore, you can observe certain people indentifying more with certain aspects of the category they weren't assigned to at birth in virtue of their genitalia. The link I sent you talks about the causes of that fluidity and tends to explain it through an incomplete masculinization or feminization of the brain.",

The reason i mention age is because you can't fully understand the consequences of an action at such an age. i don't know how old you are but if you are an adult think back to when you were a child/teen. think of all the impulse moves you made. whether it was buying something on a whim or maybe even a sexual act that you thought was a good idea but really wasn't, there's no denying that we have things like legal drinking/smoking age and age of consent.",

Medically transitioning is a very serious step. Also understand that medically transitioning is not necessary to be trans.\n3. Don‚Äôt let the hate get to you. These comments prove it‚Äôs all over the place. Namely, hate in this area is coming from ignorance. \nGender is absolutely not a social construct. Gender and sex are both biological. \nGender can be seen in the body through the brain (MRI, white/grey matter and region differences).\n\nAnd last but not least:\nWorry about transitioning when you have full control over your environment. For now, keep up with studying. Hang out with your friends and make good memories. Express yourself how you seem fit (even if that means coming out). \n\n\nPeace, brother.",

This whole argument that gender can be changed based on your own opinions, is not sustained at all by solid facts, just emotion.

        "commentText": "And just to respond to your argument which was based on your believe that gender to you, is a social construct. Almost every single word is a social construct, what is your point? The reason why there are two genders, is because throughout history, boy meant boy and girl meant girl, it was never the other way around. Of course some primitive cultures believed in third or fourth, etc genders, but that doesn't make it correct. These cultured believed in many spiritual things which contradict science and biology. My point is, the reason why there are two genders is because 99.99% of the human race either has an XX or XY chromosome, with acceptance for those with very rare genetic disorders which greatly affect their body and health (height, weight, body hair, bone structure, etc), these are genetic disorders because they are not normal and come with a multitude of cons, nature does not intend for there to be a third gender for the human race, whenever this phenomenon happens (XXY, YY), it results in non-normal distribution of testosterone and estrogen along with many other disastrous variations. \n\nThe healthy human, has an XX or XY chromosome is my other point, which is why most healthy human beings have one of the two, I made this argument just to disassemble your upcoming argument on the fact that third genders genetically exist. Of course they do, but they are genetic mutations which are very rare and affect the person's body greatly. \n\nAnother thing, males and females are intended by nature to look and behave differently. Which is why binary gender exists for the two genitalia. Just to disassemble your \"genderfluid\" bullshit.",

This ideology is philosophically consistent because it is based upon being able to modify and disregard DNA based on how you feel in the mind. You would know what I meant if you read my comments you fucking dumb degenerate. Just like race, sex is genetic. If you have XY chromosomes you are a male, if you have XX chromosomes, you are a female. No amount of surgery or hormones can change this, dumbass. Now dumbass, you still haven't answered my question. If gender/sex, which is GENETIC/PERMANENT, can be changed based on the individual's convenience, then why cannot race which is GENETIC/PERMANENT as well be changed? Gender is genetic, if you even bother to argue against this, you're full of shit.",

Just imagine if you found someone you loved so much and they made you so happy and you have never felt this way about someone and then it turns out they have the same genitalia as you and they are transgender. That would be so fucked up and you would basically be forced into a homosexual relationship without even knowing. That stays with you for life, you cannot change it.",

This mentally ill female is parading her dysfunction on the internet hoping her dysfunction which leads to suicide 31% of the time makes her some sort of YouTube star. Taking drugs and having surgeries is not a game. This behavior should NOT be encouraged or celebrated. It is dangerous.\n\nConditioning children to believe the absurdity that they or anyone could be ‚Äúborn into the wrong body,‚Äù and that a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse. Affirming gender dysphoria via public education and legal policies will confuse children and parents, leading more children to present to ‚Äúgender clinics‚Äù where they will be given puberty-blocking drugs. This, in turn, virtually ensures that they will ‚Äúchoose‚Äù a lifetime of sterility, toxic cross-sex hormones, and likely consider unnecessary surgical mutilation of their healthy body parts as young adults. Puberty is not a disorder and therefore should not be arrested as though it is a disease.",

Whoever told you that gender dysphoria is biological is incorrect///\n\nCan I ask you to clarify this, because physiology is a subset of biology, if something is physiological, then it must also be biological. \n\nDid you mean psychological?\n\nAre you saying that gender dysphoria is exclusively a mental illness? You see, if gender dysphoria is a mental health problem and nothing else, then that begs the question; how can surgery be justified? The surgical treatment of mental health problems went out of fashion with the lobotomy. If gender dysphoria is exclusively a mental health issue, how can you possibly justify giving puberty blockers to pre-pubescent children? If gender dysphoria is not a physical, biological thing, then reassignment surgery is just a huge sticking plaster that does nothing more than prop up someone's illusions.\n\nYou see the problem? For reassignment surgery to be a rational, logical option, then you have to accept that gender dysphoria is biological. That you can be born the 'wrong' gender. If you accept that gender dysphoria is biological, then there can only be two genders. If you dont accept that gender dysphoria is biological, then it can only be psychological. That makes gender dysphoria a mental illness and reassignment surgery becomes irrational and immoral in many cases. You cant have it both ways. Whichever side you come down on, your choice alienates half of the trans community.",

Then all people who don't accept the gender they are born with having this so-called ''mental disease'' even if they try to act straight and oppress their feelings and they way they naturally faction since they are born.\nSo being trans isn't the disease we talk about, but the solution many of these people find to ''cure'' this disease! Since there are no meds that can make them accept their gender! (different to gays who accept their gender and the body they are born with)!\nSo even if it is a disease, we should let them be whatever makes them happy.  and not point the finger at them telling them they are mentally ill! Fighting their inner self because of taboos, and being oppressed and ridiculed by society, is way worse for them than letting them be and dress as they wish! (and can lead to unhappy lifes,  depression, marginalism, and even to suicides.) \nAnd if all people who don't like their body they are born with are mentally ill, then 90% of the planet have mental diseases. \nSo if you are streight and aren't affected by this it's unethical and sort of evil attacking people with ''mental illnesses'' just because you don't like them. It's like going to psychiatric hospitals telling the patients -Hey dude you have a mental disease!!",

If I think I'm Batman, I need medical treatment, not people saying \"It's okay, you can be whatever you want, Mr. Wayne\".

I don't see trans people as freaks, that actually offends me because you're accusing me of something I'm clearly not, I respect everyone EQUALLY. What I'm saying is that transgenders are people who need help to blend in our society, but \"feeding\" their gender dysphoria by saying \"you can be whatever you want\" is no help at all.\n\nWell, guess what people with messiah complex say: \"I KNOW I'm destined to something big. I'm SURE I'll save my country/the world.\" People with disorders of this kind usually deny they have a problem until it's evident for them that something's not right. Even if it's not the same as that, as the name says, it's, like depression or anxiety. People with any kind of dysphoria seek psychology to overcome that mental state, not pills to \"feed\" the problem even more. \n\nLet's say I have depression because I'm physically handicapped (which I actually am, it's a disease with unknown cure or treatment, but I have no depression because of that). If I go to a psychologist, he won't tell me \"oh, poor thing. I'll give you artificial legs so you can walk\", he will try to make me accept what I am and live my life the best I can. My parents suffered from serious depression after my brother died (I didn't because I was a baby), they went to a psychologist and he helped them accept and overcome his death, he didn't say \"you can have another kid to replace him\", that's absurd (and cruel, too).\n\nBesides, can you back that up? Can you prove that trans people commit suicide only because they're not accepted? How do you know there aren't other reasons? Most transgender people who try or commit suicide are teens and young adults, a period of life that is very hard and confusing for most heterossexuals, imagine what it's like for transgenders: severe cases of identity crisis which leads to depression, which may lead to suicide. Relationship problems, unhappiness with body modifications, etc, etc... See? There are other possible reasons. As far as I'm aware, transssexuals and transgenders are getting more and more respected and accepted, but the suicide rates are this high. It simply doesn't make sense.\n\nLast, but not least, I used to be homophobic, I despised gays and saw them as abnormals, and I've changed my mind because someone convinced me it wasn't like that. I will change my opinion on this matter when you or someone else use convincing enough arguments.\n\nAnd regarding your english, no problem. English isn't my first language either.",

People can do whatever they want, even live in a world of lies and illusions, but don't come complaining and whining if you find out that escapism doesn't solve your problems.\n\nNow that's where you're mistaken about me. If I wanted them to suffer, I wouldn't want to help them accept themselves and seek help if they need. How can they be accepted if they don't do it for themselves first? \n\nI'm not against breast augmentation, but I don't advise it because implants may cause lymphomas and other serious problems which will require the remotion of the breast in worst case scenarios. There are also bad surgeons that, yes, make your boobs bigger, but then they get ugly because the surgeon is a bad professional. Assymetrical breasts, balloon/gravity defying breasts and visible scars are very common \"issues\" in breast augmentation surgeries. If a woman close to me asked my opinion I'd say \"don't do it, because (insert reasons I said before)\". As for breast reduction, there's no danger other than visible scars, so I'd say \"it's a waste, but go ahead and do it if you want\".\n\nAs for tattoos, it's the same: not against it, but I don't advise it. Big tattoos are cool when we're young, but when we get old and the skin gets flabby, the tattoo will be ruined and you will regret it. The remotion of tattoos is expensive and painful, there's that, too.\n\nAs for gender and society, the word \"gender\" itself as we're using it is a social construct made by those who say everything's a social construct. In reality, there's no such thing as genders, in this context, of course. What exist are men and women with different personalities: from feminine men to masculine women. Even I, sometimes feel more feminine or more masculine. Sometimes I'm grossed out or apathic to sexual stimuli, sometimes I respond positively to it. Sometimes I like shopping, sometimes I like MMA. Does it mean I'm genderfluid (is that the word?)? No, it just means I have a personality that changes according to my state of mind and it can change in a matter of seconds. Gender is just a word that mostly feminists and LGBT activists use in a deceptive manner, claiming that a feminine man or a masculine woman is a gender amongst 153 others.",

I'm supposed to just let them call me names because I want to treat gender dysphoria as what it is: a dysphoria? Sorry, but no. I'm not gonna just sit and do nothing. What psychologists do nowadays isn't a definitive solution, it's clearly a temporary one, looking at the suicide rates. \n\nYes, cis people also commit suicide, but they're not even near 40%. You can't compare. If even after 1 year of examining transgenders and after the transition, some still commit suicide, then psychologists are obviously doing something wrong. That's the famous definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expect different results. Assuming most transgenders nowadays seek psychologists, but still their methodology for treating gender dysphoria has a success rate of nearly 60% (pretty low compared to other dysphorias like anxiety and depression), that means that sex transition still isn't the ideal treatment. The logical solution is \"let's try other methods and see how it goes\". That's how science approaches problems, try different methods until one reaches satisfactory results and 60% success rate is nowhere near satisfactory.",

It entails taking hormonal supplements for the rest of their lives to ensure that their body matches who they are (their gender). Gender dysphoria is not as simplistic as a psychological problem, as you state. It is a physiological anomaly that can only be treated by making the body match up with the gender that the brain IS. It's not a mental illness or a personality disorder. It's way more complex than that. How does it hurt you in any way that the preferred treatment (only treatment that works) is not what you subjectively (and naively) believe what is right and wrong? It doesn't affect you in any way. So it's not your place, at all, to determine what the best option is for those who are transgender.",

God made this path for the lgbt because there are the strong to follow their wishes a d there paths to there greatness.  And even besides if god exists or not we should love each other anyway.

I only wish that you lived nearer to me, so I could arrange to meet you face to face and ,,,,,,,,,,, discuss this.\nI gather that you think you are some sort of hero in the eyes of the public with your Dickensian, prehistoric,  uneducated, exceptionally ignorant, and uninformed views, but you are NOT a hero.\nNor will you ever be respected by any intelligent, emphatic, or forward thinking woman, for your pathetic out-dated views.\nCrawl back into the hole you somehow managed to escape from, and live your life, like people did 1,000 years ago, as this is where your social and I.Q. level is befitting.\nAnd before you make any uninformed comments by return, be aware that I am 100% Male heterosexual, an Ex Super Bike racer, ( I have no fear), I am married to a beautiful woman, the kind that you could only dream about, and I have a daughter who wants to transgender, and become a male.\nI am fully supporting my amazing child, and I will not accept the kind of comments made by imbeciles like you, who would last 1 minute in the company of the superior people whose presence I frequent.\nI hope this makes you rethink your narrow minded and out dated point of view.\nI'm looking forward to your reply, if you think you are informed and articulate enough challenge me, let the battle commence.",

These fucks want us to accept them \"for who they are\" when they can't even accept themselves for whom they were born as. You can't just be a fucking male at birth and 10 years later suddenly become a female, dipshit.

People with schizophrenia or psychosis are given medication to try and regulate their brain chemistry, counseling and other means of treatment are valid ways to mitigate the issues. I understand none of the treatments might not work but that does not make these people \"normal\"...\n\nHormones and puberty blockers mean the boy or girl will literally be infertile. If they ever get help down the road or they feel like turning their gender back to fit their sex then they will never be able to have children.

Hormones are a very good way to treat dysphoria, but you are right about possible infertility. Children are normally put on blockers until they're old enough to make a choice about estrogen/testosterone so they have plenty of time to change their minds. Blockers only pause puberty, if they choose to go back to their biological sex they can simply stop the blockers and resume puberty. Most transgender people will freeze their eggs/sperm so if they do change their minds or just feel like having children, they can unfreeze them.",

You know gender dysphoria IS a recognized mental illness right? \n\nOkay, lets open this up here, NO there aren't any traceable genetics that determine gender. Gender identity is ones personal experience to a gender or genders. It is something that is more or less an understanding of ones self, ultimately a social construct. Genders do exist and you misinforming people on this subject is really what is adding to people not fully understanding what gender is. \n\nPeople can be born without a penis and still identify as a male. There are syndromes such as klinefelter syndrome that are a good example of a male with female body parts. The chromosome make up is XXY. Fun fact. In ANY variation of chromosomes if there is a Y present the person identifies as a male. Genetic anomalies are a thing, they do happen, and ignorance doesn't make them go away. \n\nThe great thing about facts is that whether or not you believe them, they still are a fact.",

I mean ffs the medical industry is extremely political, they don't care if they are killing you (that's why they have no problem prescribing you opiates). Transition has a negligible effect on suicide rates, the only long term study on gender dysphoria has proven this.\n\nA 42% suicide rate? That puts Holocaust suffers to shame. It's obvious a mental illness and we need to find a way to help these people. Transitioning has no significant effect on suicide rates (probably no effect at all), so to assume a course of action that will steralize you for the rest of your life probably isn't smart.\n\nI by no means am saying to not allow them to transition. I think it's fucking retarded, but if you are a grown adult and want to transition, that is your choice. However if you are under 18, you should NEVER be allowed to.

Going through gender reassignment surgery and feeling \"accepted\" within your family or community has no significant effect on the suicide rate according to the only long term study done on gender dysphoria.\n\nAll this shows us is something is actually wrong with people who experience this phenomenon. And honestly I think we need to find actual solutions to help these people. Transitioning is an adult's choice, I give zero shits what someone does with their body. HOWEVER, doctors prescribing this as the best course of action with no factual evidence to back this up is disgusting. And so is pushing this onto children (who a great majority of will grow out of this phase).",

I'd feel much more comfortable looking like a woman! I want the fat distribution and lack of muscle mass! I wish there was a way to stop this slope towards masculinity! \"  and then they don't expect anyone to call them a woman or whatever anyways because they realize that \"gender\" is only meaningful in situations that deal with reproduction.  I don't give a fuck if you call me a man or  a woman because it really doesn't matter. I'm concerned with how I want to look to myself.  \n   This particular thing is heavily similar to people wanting to cut or dye their hair or wear clothes that they feel naturally represent themselves...ibcluding tattoos and piercings. \nI would like to feel comfortable going in public in \"women clothes\" and be able to look in the mirror naked without this sense of \"fuck, this sucks\".",

But one god doesn‚Äôt give a shit what you do, and also if someone wants to transition the can, because its not harming you at all, and it helps the person them self for right in there body. And for me I get mistaken all the time and thats not my fault, so if I were to transition no one would know and so let people do what they want.",

Bringing religious in a non-religious video is way ruder anyway! lets see if you like religious talk:\nFirst of all you are wrong, the jewish god doesn't love everyone no matter what, you don't even know what you believe in, there are 1000 bible verses of hate for others, specifically according to your god, gays, pagans, adulters, Babylonians, magicians, fortune tellers and many more  should be stoned to death!!! If he loves everyone why he destroyed sodom and gomora? why he killed all earths population even the innocent babies and animals  in the cataclysm? why does he order Jews to kill even the babies and animals of their enemies¬† and take the virgins to themselves? why he kills all newborn babies of Egypt? why Jesus said those who won't listen to me will face a worse fate than sodm and Gomora? Why did Jesus said I didn't come to bring peace but a sword? Why he sents so many to hell to be tortured forever? \nSee this is what happens when you bring up your religion where it has no place to be!!!",

(even the natural human body is sinful for god even though he supposedly created it) .As for the OT, Jesus says he accepts everything in the OT. Besides, it was his father doing them! And what were the sins of innocent newborns and animals exactly? As for Sodom and Gomora why he didn't give them the freedom of free will to sin as he does to us today (obviously) and had to vanish them violently like that? So there goes the apologetic argument of free will...\nAnyway although I don't mind religious arguments I think this isn't the place for this, I just wanted to show that religion is better kept for your self or appropriate religious videos and communities, not public unrelated videos on youtube. What trans people do to their bodies is their right, and it's not appropriate to rub christianity (or any other relgn) in their face.",

You are going to find out soon enough that having all that hair is not what it is cracked up to be.\n\nAlso what made you think at 16 that you wanted to fuque-up the rest of your life while trying to pretend that you are a man when you are not.  Do you have any idea as to the suicide rate among Transgendered people?  Then there are those who want to change back because \"CHANGING\" was not all it is cracked up to be.  Explain to us how you are going to have sex my friend.  Like a woman?  Also, if you have an implant it will not eve come close to what we men feel when we're having sex !!!  You've have basically ruined the rest of your life because finding a sex partner who is OK with your changes will be few and far between.\n\nYour parents had to have been totally out to lunch to allow you to do this to yourself at that young an age !!!

My question is why can't a person who feels they have been born into the wrong body, just accept the reality of that without changing it?? It is a beautiful working body regardless of if you do not like it. I am a woman, but if I wanted to do everything as a man, couldn't that just be like a super coulorful expression rather than a need to physically alter my appearance and body parts? There are lots of things I am not happy about with my body and my life, and yes I would trade it for a totally different life and body right now if that were a realistic option. But I just kind of breath through the things I don't like, and find a spiritual center to help me cope with life. I just don't fully understand why that is not an option for those with gender dysmorphia.",

In 10-20yrs from now, genomic science will produce a pill that can change sexes just by taking it, it's so easy to change genes already, it's the matter of time. Sex is not determined only by XY genomes. Adults Men's testicles can turn to ovaries just by stopping a single gene and women's ovaries to male testicles in same fashion. This is because all animals used to be hermaphrodites--meaning both female/male in a single body. Read science books, ans you will see what you believe is not the real true world.

    "commentText": "my Mum and I have been talking about me being transgender for a while. But she's got more and more angry with me about it. She admitted herself in the worst tone possible that she will not support me until I \"fully develop\" and truly know what its like to be a girl. Then she said you need to find yourself, and that doesn't mean overnight, it takes YEARS! When I've already had years! Now she's saying I have to wait a minimum of 6 years (when I'm a legal adult) before we can start thinking of changing my name etc. Never mind getting surgery. I don't want to live that long as a girl and she just doesn't understand that. My Dad literally laughed in my face and left when I came out to him. I haven't told my brother, or anyone else. I have no idea what they might say. Maybe I just have to wait another 6 years; half my life. I also think I'm bisexual too. They think I got all this nonsense from the internet. This is because they keep on asking the same questions like \"Why do you want to be a boy?\" and I mean... Who can explain that? I don't want to be transgender, wanting to be the opposite sex is like someone saying they prefer red over green, YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN IT! And they said and keep on saying things like \"that sounds like you got that from the internet. WHEN. I. HAVE. NOT. My Mum also said I would make a lovely, beautiful girl, or an ugly boy. I just can't anymore. They also know I'm depressed but act like they don't know and ask me \" Why are you acting 2cool4school?\". I literally just want to die on the spot. If I tell my friends they will most likely hate me, i even had a conversation about trans people to my friend (as it randomly went into subject) and she said that her Mum hates trans people, and Lulu asked whether I was transsexual or not (I replied with no)and she said, \"good, I mean imagine if you were... Please don't be.\" If I tell the teachers about it they'll think it as an awkward subject and won't help me. My parents won't do anything until I'm 'fully developed' which will take God knows how long. Although there is a trans FTM in my school who just changed who's in year 10. I really want to ask him about it but I'm afraid he might just think I am a creep because it's too much of a personal thing for him or something and it will be embarrassing and humiliating for both of us. I recently cut my hair to a stereotypical boys length for charity. But that was basically just an excuse to look more like a boy. My parents are now forcing me to grow it out because almost everyone hates my hair now because its not normal for a girl too have it that short, plus I won't be able to get any girl OR boy parts in a musical theatre group I am in. Mainly because I can't have a boy part because I'm not a \"boy\" and I can't have a girls part because no one will think I'm a girl in the audience while I'm on stage and they'll get confused. I don't know what to do. I hate my life. I don't want to wait because people are already saying things and teasing me in front of me saying things such as \"Are you a boy or a girl?\" Even though they have known me since the start of the year and know perfectly well that I am a girl (but I don't want to be, so this isn't really much of an issue, as I like being called a boy, I just get scared of how people can be so heartless...) Please help!\n\n\n\n\nSorry this was such a long message! I am glad and extremely happy that you managed to read this far down, I did not expect it to be so long.",

I am so glad my parents stopped me when I was 14 and wanted to get married! I am now 27 and don't know if I even want to ever get married. You were made by God a girl and probably quite a special girl. We all have a purpose. Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because of people thinking they were smarter than God, that they knew better, that they could do what they wanted to do and deify the laws of God. Parents are there for a reason. They are there to make sure we don't do stupid things before we can really understand the world. Unfortunately the world has got the notion that deciding to be a girl or a boy is an option. It isn't. You will be a girl regardless of what you do with your body. This \"boy\" in this video is still a girl, that's what she was made to be. Outside appearance can be changed... There is a good chance that 10 years or 20 years down the road she will be unhappy with her choice. Your mind is a powerful tool. You can decide to be unhappy with something and your mind will be convinced. Likewise you can choose to be content, to find your purpose in life as a girl and achieve great things. Oh and by the way God is loving and kind, but like a parent who loves you and lays down rules for your own benefit, there are consequences to disobeying His laws. They may not be felt now, or even 20 years from now but there will be real consequences to all of our decisions in every aspect of life when we part from the the natural law of God. May Jesus help you as you grow. It is a changing and godless world we are living in, it will only get harder but right is still right and wrong is still wrong. Jesus helps those who ask.",

That is unsurprising when you consider the tidal wave of growth and sex hormones that flood the body during childhood and puberty. It is a normal and natural part of growing up. It is a mistake not to give herself the opportunity to naturally resolve the crisis by simply growing out of it. That may not happen, but in most cases, that is exactly what does happen. Her dysphoria may simply evaporate as she grows into an adult and her hormones stabilise.\n\nIt is important to remember that reassignment is not a cure. The young man in the video is extremely convincing, he should be able to live his life exactly as he chooses for the most part. But while he may look like a man, his biology will never be male and that will always be there for him. Reassignment may help for many, but it is not a cure.",

        "commentText": "\"Not a cure\" well firstly that's off to the person transitioning. Perhaps some of them will never be fully fully happy with their internal organs but for most transitioning alleviates dysphoria and feelings of suicide and self-harm tendencies. Not every single transgender individual is happy after or during and some realize it's not for them-but it NEEDS to be up to the person themselves whether they want to do this because no one can speak for them and transitioning has changed so many people's lives for the better. I suggest you not assume but look at the people who can self report on this. https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/32hvk7/are_you_happier_after_transition/\nhttps://www.quora.com/Are-most-people-who-undergo-a-gender-transition-happier-after-transition-than-before-it\nI think happiness is pretty convincing\nI also think that in a perfectly accepting world there would be less pressure to transition as long as other knew who you were-but in this society transgendered individuals are forced to live a double life unless they can pass.\nI get how it's confusing for people because identity crisis is a part of being a teenager. But even with people who transition late their stories go back to feelings of dysphoria evident since very very young. Some children do grow out of it-so my beef with your argument is your implication it can't be a cure (and the possible implication that they can be converted back?).\nI think that while we need a balanced approach and I actually generally agree with what your saying (you do seem to have a bias in assuming that's what WILL happen though and I think that at this point it's safe to say he's clearly not growing out of it) when figuring this out-using these arguments to force children to undergo bodily changes they clearly loathe is very unethical. For many kids who-say-grow out of a tomboy phase they will just go through their normal puberty. If someone is going through puberty and viscerally wants it paused they need to be listened to, they need to be given time to think about it before irreversible changes happen. Because if they're forced to go through those changes and then are left with just trying to reverse what happened, that will still make them feel better but they will not as easily pass-which will open them up to harassment and stigma from and leave them with a body that's not as fully male/female as they wanted it to be.",

        "commentText": "RDB ///\"Not a cure\" well firstly that's off to the person transitioning.///\n\nPeople often dont want to hear the truth, nevertheless there it is. You can choose whether or not to be offended by it. \n\nTo expand on the 'cure' statement, it really rather depends on the nature of the problem. If the issue is one of simply being unhappy with your appearance, then transitioning can be a cure. But I suspect that is almost never the case and if it's only appearance that is the issue, then your issues are probably not deep enough to warrant irreversible surgery and hormones. If you truly believe you are the wrong sex, then transitioning will not 'cure' you, because you can only change your appearance, you cannot change your sex. The young man in the video very definitely looks male, he will pass as a man 100% of the time. But at the risk of stating the obvious, he is not actually male and never will be. It can never be more than a masquerade. That might be enough for some, but I wouldn't be shocked if it falls short of expectations for most.\n\nI'm sure that many who transition state they are happier. But happiness is relative. Being happier that you were when you were suicidal, is progress but it may not be the great leap forward you might have been hoping for. You know when people make a big investment into something, it is human nature for them to evangelise about the wisdom of their investment. They are not necessarily the best people to ask for impartial advice. In long term studies, it's interesting to note that pre and post transition suicide rates, remain unchanged. Transitioning might help to some extent, but it isn't a cure and it's going to leave you with a whole bunch of new problems to deal with, such as sexuality to name an obvious one. Is the young man in the video going to date men or women? Is he going to confine his dating to the LGBT community, or will he date straight men or women? If he dates a woman, will that make him straight, or gay? Will he care? Maybe not, but will she? Will he be honest about his trans status at the start of the relationship? Will he date gay men? Would that make him straight or gay? Will his partner care that the guy he's having sex with, used to be (or still is?) female? This is a hell of a lot to expect anyone to rationalise, let alone a young child.\n\nI take your point about an early transition producing better physical results, but there is way more at stake here than that. The parents, guardians and doctors have a duty of care to this young girl and if they get any of it wrong, they have abused their position and the child. The only thing to lose by waiting, is the physical results may not be quite so convincing. But given the vast array and complexities of the psychological issues, then without any doubt we/they/ everyone should err on the side of caution and wait until the individual is capable of making mature, competent, well balanced decisions ...and taking all the responsibility for the consequences of getting it wrong.\n\n///and I think that at this point it's safe to say he's clearly not growing out of it///\n\nBut he could come to regret it. It's not unheard of. That is the problem, if he does then couldn't he reasonably turn to the adults who had responsibility for him and say \"how the hell could they let me do it, I was just a child?\".",

There are some people who think they are cats or babies etc there life revolves around that so whos to say wanting to change gender isn't the same sort of problem? I think its important to understand the psychology behind the feelings of why you want to change gender before actually going through with any changes in oppose to watching a bunch of people in the media and youtube celebrate their change. \n\nMaybe one day they'll have hard evidence that a brain can be born in the wrong body but for now its not.",

        "commentText": "+Ghost 572 that is exactly the point. In all the case records of pre-pubescent gender dysphoria, 75% of them come to accept their biological sex if allowed to progress through puberty naturally. Being unhappy with your physical body is really very common among teenagers. That doesn't mean there is a physical illness. It's also important to remember that taking puberty blockers and sex hormones, damages a perfectly healthy body. It's also important to consider that the pressure from trans-activists to have gender dysphoria declassified as a mental illness, is socio-political in origin. It isn't rooted in science, because there isn't any ...or precious little. It's not the same as bringing pressure on society to accept homosexuality, even though it is often compared to it. There are distinct differences and distinctly different claims with profoundly different consequences. Gender dysphoria has nothing to do with sexuality and accepting someone is gay, does not require that we give body-damaging puberty blockers, surgery and carcinogenic sex hormones to children. There needs to be a substantial body of evidence to be sure we are doing the right thing - and we dont have it yet. The trans activists and pressure groups have an intrinsic bias. Obviously they want their condition to be accepted as biological rather than psychological, but we need to be extremely cautious before accepting the \"I'll kill myself if you dont let me transition\" guilt trip that is often applied to parents, guardians and the medical community.",

I mean as a ftm, are you going to go for gay men in the hope they will overlook your female genetics? Or would you go for straight women, in the hope they will also overlook your female genetics? Do you plan to trick them by not telling them? Or are you going to be honest upfront and risk being lonely?",

        "commentText": "+alexander 202 OK, so how do you think a straight woman would feel, knowing that you used to be female and in fact still have 100% female genetics even after surgery/hormones? You see, even though you might feel male, biologically you are not and never will be. Do you not think someone who considers themselves to be straight female, might feel challenged by that? At what point is 'before going serious'? Is that before holding hands? Before the first kiss? Or before sex? Do you not think that any level of romance under such circumstances, might cause someone to feel revulsion and create a sense of self-loathing? You see, while you might have come to terms with being you, but nobody else is required to. I can tell you as a straight male, I would only consider genetic females for partners. I cant help that. We don't choose our sexuality and we are not in control of who we are attracted to. That is the same for straight or gay, male or female. Gay people want same-sex partners, straight people want opposite-sex partners and while gender is fluid, sex is not. For most of the population, transgender partners are not an option. That is the reality.\n\nIt is possible that you could 'pass' (deceive someone) long enough for someone to have feelings for you before dropping the bomb. But to hope that they wont be revolted or angered by the deception, is a lot to ask, don't you think? If you are not upfront from the very start, you will suffer an awful lot of painful and angry rejections. If you are upfront from the beginning, you will most likely be taking yourself 'off the menu' and wont get the dates.\n\nHave you thought about this?\n\nI appreciate that gender is not the same as sexuality, but a decision to transition will have significant and lifelong implications for it. As someone who is sexually immature, do you think you posses the sexual maturity to make those decisions?",

        "commentText": "Martyntd5 yes I know where your coming from and it's tough, it really is knowing that your not the real deal and that's what troubles almost every transgender out their. But, we've come to this era where we can change our biological sex, it's possible. In 2011 they managed to change a female mice's ovaries into testes and produce the average amount of testosterone as a regular male mice by just turning on (or off I forgot) one gene. Imagine in 10 years time we can completely change and manipulate the sex where we can in the future be full male one day and the next female. We all take gender for granted, like we were given that gender for a reason and we can't do nothing about it. I know it will be hard to find someone who accepts you. But that's not the only big thing that goes on in your life, what about work, vacations, parties and all these different activities, it's not all just about sex and whether if I have the right genitalia. Life isn't all fixated on that, and people now a days need to understand that, that the whole we live in is more capable at making our dreams come true. But honestly I don't know how my life will be on 5 or 10 years time, I guess I'll just have to wait and find out.",

Eventually, I started to like my longer hair and came to appreciate my femininity more and more as I grew older. I lost the desire to become a boy and just accepted my physical gender as a girl. If my mother had let me cut my hair short, I wonder if I would identify as male now.\n\nI know that this is the wrong youtube page to be posting this kind of story, but I just had the urge to share and maybe let someone who felt like becoming the opposite gender at some point in their life, but ended up deciding to remain their physical gender, know that they are not alone. \n\nNot everyone who has the desire to be the opposite gender at some point will neccesarily follow through with their wish.",

Being a dude, I envy how deep your voice is (deeper than mine LOL) however curious to know what sort of Test are you on: C, E or mixed which brings back to wonder about the slow facial hair growth process which makes me realise perhaps it's gotta do with genetics, ie. does any male members of your family experienced the same thing? Being aware of the negative side effects of T ranging from severe mood swings (roid rage) to severe acne breakout from what i've seen. Thanks for making such great videos, you are an inspiration to the LGBT world. All the best for your continuing journey.. :)",

I know the question is strange, but I'd like to understand that he is attracted to women,then a lesbian transgender would she feel pleasure in having sex with him? taking pleasure in the sense of attraction, not physical pleasure .. strange question but I hope someone can answer me",

All my life I have felt different and when I found out about what transgender is, I knew immediately I was. I'm scared to come out and tell everyone I am transgender. I told a few close friends, and they both ditched me and stopped being my friends because of it. I'm scared of what my parents and my class will say, or even if they will let me go to school anymore. And if they will accept me because all my life I acted or pretended like a stereotypical girl all day every day. It would be awesome if you reply, might even change my life, Thank You! : )",

Technically everyone has a penis, on girls it's called a clitoris, and when exposed to male hormones, it grows into a small penis, look it up on google if you're curious. It also gets erect. So do clitorises, you just can't tell the difference because they are so small, but we are ALL born with erectile tissue, glans and a shaft, exposure to hormones will just enlarge and change the appearance to be more male.",

And if this was natural, than tell me, has anything like this happened at all is history? Nothing like this was even possible even less then 100 years ago. lets not be in denial, Lets be objective, its im not stating an opinion, but injecting testosterone into the blood stream is NOT natural, that is why in the body building community, someone that takes steroids (steroids is synthetic testosterone) is said about him that \"he is not a natural body builder\" that is a term that is commonly used. Its scary that the masses are accepting the unnatural as natural, just shows how easily things can be skewed. Very dangerous.

It is no longer natural when it comes from a lab, packaged, then injected into the bloodstream. Am I crazy for saying that's not natural? If a body builder were to do the same, he would be disqualified from any \"natural\" body building contests, and would not be classed as a \"natural\" body builder.",

But I want you to think about this. Do you Love GOD?, If you love him ,then why did you change what GOD created as your body?- maybe your answer would be, we have a choice, or we are not perfect. ~yeah we have a choice, but the morality of that choice is too ugly in the eyes of GOD. Its not too late, I am not forcing you anything, what I have is only an Advice ~ read the Bible & be happy ,how, & what GOD created you to be.

If you are chromosome xx - you're female , if you're xy - you're male.This can't be changed. Chopping bits off and adding bits on doesn't change a thing. If they dig up your bones in 1000 years , they would be able to tell what sex you were.You can pump yourself with artificial hormones - they will just mask your true gender. Doctors are just using all these transsexuals to conduct their experiments on them - they're willing participants , so why not?",

    "commentText": "No, we you start getting hair loss...you reduce the testoserone dosage....its not a male precaution...haha  Why because your diet also affects your hormones and level of activity etc.  As we age, a lot changes....including sensitivity or lack of to hormones....so I wouldn't blame it all on testosterone nor would I give it all the credit..look at the males in your family and see how their natural testosterone works for them.  And as you as and increase level of activity or not...your feet will grow again....so it's not all hormones.  So what can we do for feet....sleep once a week or twice in the recumbant position (only your legs...keep your back flat as normal)..that means with your knees elevated...and perhaps a bolster underneath your knees or a pillow...  Next stretch your feet out...everyday or several times per week or your clogging honey man..or man honey...that means your toes are not getting exercised nor relaxed because you dont stretch them out....  Where comfortable sneaker with arch support if you need it...walking around flat footed all day is not good for posture..etc...  Do rub down your feet with a little Suave Advance Therapy....something that is water soluble and will hydrate your skin...and perhaps so some very low impact aerobic....why....you don't want to ruin your joints...everything in your body takes a joint and articulation...so if you're not working out you are not engaging your circulation and if you over do it you can ruin your joint....and well winter is on the way....hormones are very temperamental and come with a threshold...I think during the summer you reduce the load and during winter you get off the hormones temporarily...something like that...  You also dont want to assume men dont have any hips....men have hips...they just wear larger fitting clothes...there are all kinds of mens in the world...and hormones work intermittently so why are you on them full time...all that you may need to address your local congress and our national congress...hormones are considered enzyme catalysts...that means they are short lived and live for seconds at a time and the body only requires a minute quantity rarely if its going to be and continue to be sensitive to hormones...same idea with insulin but with insulin we get the food factor and what you ate...blah, blah..so we can't compare them...",

Why would God make some people attracted to the same sex if it's wrong? Why would God even care what we do with our bodies, as long as we are being good people? Why would God care that this person decided to take testosterone to become stronger and look like a man, seeing as it doesn't really change his moral character. I don't know, it sounds like you're speaking for God. Maybe this is just what you think, and perhaps God would prefer you to let people overcome the hurdles he has put into their lives without making it all the more difficult. After all, it is THEIR life, and being rude to transgender people doesn't make YOU a better person, Mr. Andersson.",

To be honest my son's dad still hopes this isn't a phase he wakes up from and regrets it. That concern is from a place of love. He doesn't want his child to suffer through the changes and have it be a massive mistake that can't be undone. He wants to protect his child from pain out of love. He has to learn his SON didn't make this decision on a whim.  He remembers the Daddy-Daughter dances, the little girl who twirled around in dresses I made,  his first-born baby girl he held minutes after birth--giving her her first bottle feeding. \n\nAnd yes, there are the closed-minded parents that say, \"God doesn't make mistakes.\"  My reply always is, \"Then why are there handicapped/disabled children in the world?  If He can create those children for a reason, who is to say what God has in store for transgender children?\"",

Yes, I started telling/explaining to them around age 7 or 8 what gay meant, the difference between cross-dressing and transgender, how calling someone \"tranny, fag, dyke\" was just as bad as calling someone \"retard\" or the n word. The dialogue continued from there. I think I always knew my eldest was different from the 3rd grade which is why I stressed at an early age, everyone should be treated with the same respect no matter how different and I'd love them no matter what.  Next week my son's dad and I are taking him to Lurie children's hospital in their gender issues dept to try and get hormones for him. \n\nI'm from the Kalamazoo area!  As some advice for you--my favorite quote:  \"It's never too late to be who you might have been.\" ü§ó",

I'm 16, and a ftm transgender. Whenever i try ti express my feeling out to my parents they reject it and say it s phase. I hate it so much and it makes me very angry , depressed and sad. I often have suicide thoughts because i realise, in my country there is no hope for transgender people. They are being  considered alot of negative things and they see our problem as a  mental disability so they treat us like we are sick . :/ . Idk how i m gonna keep this up. I have no family to support me , and that matter s the most to me. Idk...",

        "commentText": "The thing is that there is no way to tell - so you can't reassure him of something you don't know. It is a combination of genetics and hormones. Your genetics determine how much of hair on top of your head is vulnerable, your hormones actually make that vulnerable hair to slowly miniaturize and go away. The fact is that all current hair loss drugs with the exception of Minoxidil (which increases blood flow) work by blocking DHT male hormone (like Finasteride and Ketoconazole). If you have genetic history of male pattern baldness, then transitioning can initiate male pattern baldness that you would never get if you were to take DHT blockers or had female levels of it. If you got lucky with genes, then DHT will not have any effect on your hair - just like it doesn't have an effect on the back of your hair which is usually immune to it. If you have genetic history and want to keep that hair, then I would use Minox or not worry about it if you have enough money to get a hair transplant and move some of the immune hair from the back of your head to the front when it falls out. Minox however only has a moderate efficiency. It does slow down loss and makes the hair much fuller (mine even changed color to a darker shade), but it's not miraculous.",

        "commentText": "If anyone is interested, this problem did get solved for me.\n\nThe thing about fat redistribution is that it's not actually the body fat you already have moving location, it's that testosterone signals your body to place new fat in your body differently, be more okay with losing fat in the ass/hips/thigh area, and overall makes it easier to have a lower body fat percentage (along with this, the broadening of your upper body can do a ton of help and offsetting the disproportionate largeness of hips). So after you start T, over time, because you burn and place down very small amounts of fat from day to day, you will eventually have a noticeable amount of fat redistribution, but it will be very gradual. If you work on losing body fat in general, this will go much quicker, and will be much more attainable than pre-t.\n\nMy problem was that I was gaining body fat the whole time (I put on about 15 pounds from staring to 1 year on T), so my body never had a chance to burn that old fat, because I was never at a caloric deficit, not even the typical, very small one that would allow redistribution very gradually. And even if my body was placing down more fat in my stomach area, T doesn't mean you will completely stop putting fat in your ass/hips all together. So the stuff I was gaining that was added to what I already had.\n\nSince I made this comment, I have lost weight and finally have hips smaller than pre-T, and I'm so fucking happy about it. What it took was tracking what I ate, eating at a caloric deficit to lose body fat, and doing it consistently. It'd be awesome if T just took care of all the work for you, but it doesn't. If your dysphoria is bad enough though, the work is totally worth it.",

The internet has change the game for trans and LGBTQ youth as far as support and information goes because there are people out there that want to help and share information. I always read some of the comments Benton gets and so many trans kids out there and so many of you are feeling isolated and alone but once you start to leave comments you can make connections with people. IT GETS BETTER....it really does.  The teenage years are the worst for any kid and add being trans or gay and it is amped up because other kids are cruel but won't always be around those people and you will be in a position to advocate for yourself.  Call the The Trevor Project or other suicide hotline if you feel like you getting too close to actually going through with it. Do you have someone you can talk to? A friend? teacherR? parent? sibling? relative? anybody?",

People on the streets walk by thinking their better cause they have more money then us. I'm not living on the streets anymore u see. But I have witnessed  alot of things many 12 yr olds don't deserve to witness. I've spent yrs siting in my orphanage waiting for a family.. I was close to having a family very recently but the sisters have told them about my past, and that I'm trans. so by now I'm sure I'm wasting away. I still haven't given up, I'm sure I should, but i want to see how my story ends :D",

Nobody should be rejected, but I know that far too many kids are. The saddest part is that trans kids need the most love and support because a transition has to be one of the most difficult things to go through at an age that is pretty crappy for most kids without confounding factors like being rejected by family, having no support system and the issues and bullying that come with transition.  Don't give up. Hope is crucial in so many facets of life, including where you are.  I promise that if you want to chat over email I will be here for you. If you are interested you can email me at daneekaps@gmail.com. I'm a mom with two kids-16 and 9 and a pediatric nurse practitioner so I know about kids and teens. I am no expert on transition but I can be someone you can talk to.",

I guess in your case, you could see if T alone does enough and if not you could take an estrogen blocker. Ideally younger kids could get on blockers and avoid the severe dysphoria associated with puberty. But it's  tough enough to talk about trans issues when you are older, I can't imagine an 8 year old trying to advocate for themselves.  I'm sure there are situations with parents who are accepting from a young age but for so many of you it just isn't possible and it breaks my heart. I hope someday we can be more accepting as a society. People like you and Benton, who are advocating and speaking out on YouTube and blogs are making a difference.",

I am not sure what one would see in the women's bathroom, but Michelle Duggar seems to think that is the reason someone would desire to change their gender.  That said, there is precedence for minors having authority to make medical decisions without parental conscent and that is regarding reproductive health care.  In the US-all 50 States- youths are emancipated for decisions regarding birth control, STD diagnosis and treatment and all prenatal care. I don't know about other countries but I will say that contrary to popular belief the US does not have the most progressive medical care so I suspect other countries have this as well.",

(He also has scoliosis).  When he went through puberty, I bought him chest binders from Underworks. I hope you can get hormone blockers before you need to bind.
