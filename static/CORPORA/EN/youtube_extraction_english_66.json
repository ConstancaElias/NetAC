In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations) ",

If the only female protagonist you can name are Aloy and Laura you must not have been gaming for a long time have you?\nAnd the reason the comments haven't been positive is cuz this dude literally bases his whole argument of videogames being sexist off one game(GTA).

Art is about the expression and vsion of the artist themselves with the freedom to create their art the way they want  . This talk shows you don't care about video games as an art form because you want to dictate to the artist what they can or can not make and just because you don't like something it does not make it  wrong and does not mean it needs to be changed. To use this persons logic on other art forms the world would have alot less books, movies and music.",

            "commentText": "Few points here, firstly, if you play Farmsville or Candy Crush, you're not a gamer, period. Playing some chinsey ass mobile device game in a waiting room, doesn't make you a gamer. Gamers play real games, gamers are passionate about real games. You cant say that Granny, sitting out back collecting virtual livestock and pestering her Facebook friends to get plots of virtual land next to her, is a gamer. You cant, because it isn't a video game. \n\nSecondly, women who are gamers and play actual games aren't out there throwing a fit because they cant play as a female character in GTA. They play GTA so they can play as the dude on the box, who goes around and does bad things to other virtual beings in that virtual city. It's GTA, it's never been about a female character being the focus, and most likely, never will, ever. Video games with female leads? Laura Croft was featured in a slew of games where she was basically Indiana Jones. KOTOR, you could create a female character to play as. <b> Elder </b>Scrolls, you can play as a female character and slay dragons in Skyrim. \n\nAs for Zelda, because sweet buttery baby Jesus this pleb needs to be sorted out on her. She doesn't run around as Sheik fighting anyone. She is in disguise and helps Link, the hero, by telling him where to go, giving hints and clues. Maybe if this poorly dressed hipster played video games he'd know a thing or two about them. No idea what basement thrift store he crawled out of but he is best just slithering back into it.<b>  Nothing</b> he said is accurate, it's just lies and misrepresentation of data.",

My sister plays mobile games even she says she is not a gamer.\n\nThis is the problem, majority of gamers (Including actual Female gamers) get annoyed because this is just false information you are trying to spread for your own stupid agenda. I showed this on PSN to a bunch of other Females on my list everyone of them replied something like... Wow is this guy retarded? My favorite was \"Thank god we have this white knight to save us from all evil gamers!\". See you treat <b> Woman </b>that actually play games like they don't understand and you do even though you obviously don't play games and for some reason you think you have more knowledge of this than actual Females who play games, you don't though you just sound like a arrogant prick.",

Well... actually you can't, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO KILL MANY, MANY,\u00a0MANY, MEN TO PROGRESS IN THE GAME!\nAlso it's fucking satire on American culture\u00a0and stereotypes...\n4)\u00a0If there was either no female characters or one or two of the playable characters were female\u00a0I bet you would complain because A: There's no females! WTF YOU CIS WHITE MALE! Or B: This game has female characters that are bad people! You can't do that it's offensive!\n\nAlso you contradict yourself multiple times! Why does <b> gender,</b><b>  race</b>, or sexuality matter? And if you want true equality, then argue about not having the draft for females, or is that not what\u00a0 you meant by \"equal?\" \n\nAlso your statistic is shit because there IS a difference between gamers like us and people who just play mobile games. Also we aren't stopping women from playing games are getting jobs in gaming, so please stop creating dragons to slay.\n\nI mean, I'm a bisexual guy and I don't give two shits who I play as in games, and I don't care if I get \"represented\" because it doesn't matter!",

Does this guy, even do research or is this TED Talk really just biased to please some <b> fat </b>feminists? Also, we gamers, DO discriminate. There are casual gamers, you know, your mom who is Town Hall 3 in Clash Of Clans which she plays on her iPhone 6. There are hardcore gamers, who base their career on gaming itself. They are NOT the same even though they share the word \"Gamer\" on themselves. See just because we don't have a Female Lead in our game, doesn't make the game sexist. Games, at least most of them, are based on fictional stories. Fiction doesn't care if some<b>  fat</b> feminist says that we need a Female Lead. It's the team who created the game who gets to decide if the game needs one or not. If you think that a game should have a Female lead JUST FOR THE SAKE OF IT, you're not a feminist fighting for equality, you're fighting for INEQUALITY and you are scared of being judged.",

The 3 men that you say are portrayed in this game as being sexist is completely blinding, these men are not being held up as a high moral figure. if they had one <b> woman </b>as one of these characters you would have still cried sexist because they would have treated her as an immoral person. you can't have it both ways. the reason they were men is because when a man is played as a degenerate in games no one care, but god forbid if it was a female. this is not feminism or equality of the sexes it is you trying to make a flawed point that originated from a flawd review. you need to stop calling out<b>  sexism</b> when you can't even see it for when it isn't there.",

In fact, the characters in GTA are SUPPOSED to be the most terrible, awful people you have ever heard of. If a female character is to be introduced into such a series, she needs to be just as awful as the other characters, or it would seem out of place. \n\nAs far as the \"boys only club\" I completely agree that most males in games completely jump on any chance to bash women that are in the same games as them, just for them being women. In truth, any easy target on the internet is going to get that treatment though. And the only reason I say \"easy target\" is because females that profess their <b> gender </b>in online games are very rare indeed. I think it would go a really long way if everyone was more honest about who they really are, just to show how much more the gap really has been bridged. Men \"boys\" shouldn't be bashing females just because they're playing the same game. Nor should females ever feel like they should have to hide their identity to avoid being berated during gaming. I'm just saying I think honesty would help a lot. Make it more clear that women do really play these games and they're not going anywhere just because some people don't like it!",

            "commentText": "I honestly feel like all these Misogyny/Racism/Xenophobic talks always make assumptions and then continue to make more assumptions from there, it just goes down a rabbit hole. A game like GTA V is far too nuanced and has far too much content within itself for it to be broken down within 3 minutes, which is how much he seems to care to dedicating any explanation of the game itself, whether it be details about characters, plot events, game-play mechanics. Does anyone else notice that? To me that is the biggest failure here, as the audience is completely naive to the game and this Paul guy takes advantage of that to express his opinion as if it is fact. It's honestly creepy to me. There is SUCH little attention given to actually detailing the game and there is never a consideration of another point of view. These topics are never put into context properly, instead they always build this simplistic antagonist which in this case an incredibly basic and stubborn gamer that is assumed to be misogynistic meaning that any mention of <b> gender </b>or content in the game that deals with a<b>  woman</b> is automatically sexist. The narrative builds in such a binary \"us against them\" fashion every damn time as a result. If you want an example of this just watch 5:48 where the comment says \"putting thi<b> s woma</b>n up to reviewing this game\". The guy stops for a moment <b> at wom</b>an and says \"hmm, interesting\". Are you kidding? There<b>  is noth</b>ing projected a<b> bout ge</b>nder anywhere else in the comment so he is just using the pronoun. For heaven's sake he even <b> uses \"</b>woman\", and not any other female pronoun like \"girl, so what is the deal here? It's ironic because I feel like that is sexist.",

            "commentText": "2:00 Oh, there are barely any females in the mix of archetypes? Maybe if you didn't yell at developers for being sexist every time they portrayed females in a way you find \"derogatory\" or \"insulting\", they would be a bit more willing to introduce female characters.\n\n2:34 One Internet search of \"47% of gamers are women?\" shows that this statistic is being completely skewed by counting smartphone games. If you want to stereotype all gamers to that South park picture in slideshow, then do that. Don't be misleading and include smartphone games in your statistics.\n\n2:54 The word girl translates as vulnerable to you? ...I'm just gonna leave it at that.\n\n3:06 Dude, your mom isn't a gamer. Just stop.\n\n4:25 At least I choose not to be a \"sexist prick\" in real life.\n\n5:45 If you can't see why having a women do the review is a clear move to push their liberal agenda, I can't help you.\n\n6:49 Do you really want to play the mean comment game? Because I can dig up just as many comments by people who are pushing this agenda that are, as you put it, \"not nice\". Unless you're okay with calling people who disagree with you \"sexist bigots\"?\n\n6:56 A review got really offensive comments? Welcome to the Internet!\n\n7:54 He's really not that funny, guys.\n\n8:12 Yeah, that was a stupid thought. No one is immune to criticism online. Again, welcome to the Internet.\n\n8:33 Let's just stop to appreciate that his talk is half way over, and he just got to the actual in-game evidence that GTA V is sexist.\n\n8:47 Well, I disagree, so we're automatically coming from different views about feminism. Please continue, though. Maybe your well thought out points will change my opinion.\n\n9:00 Wait, the male characters being good yet not female was an actual point?\n\n9:37 So they catered to their majority male audience. Sue them.\n\n10:27 No, you think the game is sexist, and I'm still sitting here waiting for those well thought out points I mentioned earlier.\n\n10:57 No, that isn't how things become art. I don't have to look at what the sociopolitical impact of my favorite songs are to appreciate them. Art takes many forms. You can interpret art however you want, but don't make it sound like it's a necessity for art to be scrutinized like that. Unless you mean to tell me that you paused Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing\" to contemplate the <b> gender </b>roles of the \"small town girl\" and \"city boy\" the first time you heard it.\n\n12:02 No, it logically implies they disagree with the people who say that there is<b>  sexism</b> present in games that they enjoyed.\n\n12:43 Please refer to my first comment on this video. You want more females to have backstories? Stop making game developers afraid of being accused o<b> f sexis</b>m when creating a multi-dimensional female character.\n\n12:47 Either ignore them, or respond with evidence and logic. Simple, really.\n\n12:58 Even that laugh-happy audience found no humor in that terrible table-flipping joke (and I use the term \"joke\" loosely).\n\n13:15 Depending on the game, inserting a strong female character could completely ruin the dynamic. Some games would have their immersion ruined because of the time periods they take place in. Others would be affected because that character does not fit in with the other characters in the narrative or with the lore of the world in general. There are lots of reasons why adding a female character that you deem \"appropriate\" could mess up a game, the largest reason being that it may not fit the creator's vision and needlessly complicate things.\n\n13:21 I just disputed it.\n\n13:52 GTA V is not for little kids. No one is showing the GTA game series to children and going, \"These are the people you should look up to.\" What are you even talking about?\n\n14:54 Oh, yeah! Feel free to punch anyone who doesn't agree with you in the face!\n\n15:05 Yeah, because Nintendo goes for the family demographic more than some other gaming companies. What I don't understand is why you were criticizing that strategy at the beginning of the video. You do realize that catering to families, including multiple ages and both the male and female demographics, helps them achieve that diversity, right?\n\n15:23 When will this stupid stereotype end? That is not gaming culture anymore! Gaming is not a \"Boys Only\" club! No one is trying to stop girls from playing video games!\n\n15:52 Yes, including girls in the gaming community is a positive thing. What you fail to understand is that you grossly over exaggerate the number of people who are against girls in the gaming community. Just to be clear, by over exaggerate, I mean you greatly inflate it using misinformation and hyperbole until the problem is a thousand times more massive than it is. All this under the assumption that it is an actual problem, which I really don't think it is, and you have do<b> ne nothi</b>ng to convince me otherwise. \n\n16:02 They need to grow up? Alright, mate. Whatever you say.",

Some are sexist others are not. I believe that it is just as important to have sexist video games as it is to have non-sexists games. In Fact... Why the hell are people even bringing <b> gender </b>into videogames. Videogames have always been a place to escape the world were \"political correctness\" has never existed so I don't see why people are trying to bring political correctness into this genre of life. I have never in a video game stopped and thought \"oh she's a girl soo...\" \u00a0I have always though \"they are a hero who happens to be a girl\" In videogames you enter the world the game designer created its not the other way around where the game enters our own. and by the way you don't have a buy a game you don't agree with.",

Sure GTA V is a fun game and I paid money for it even after knowing how problematic it was because I like going online and sandboxing as a mute criminal, but it's so much harder to enjoy a game that actively excludes your demographic from it's potential customers. GTA V came out years ago and I only recently bought it because I stepped in for my brother while he was playing one time and had to go to the bathroom which made me realize that getting the game and playing online with him and with friends would be fun. Meanwhile for games like Drago<b> n Ag</b>e, Skyrim, The Division, and so many others that offer similar gameplay features (such as open worlds, sandbox, character customization, online play, etc.) I have been able to enjoy those games so much more. Even when they don't make an effort to inclusive of their audience, if they at least avoid alienating potential customers the game will be much more enjoyable. I admit that I've never found a game as fleshed out or detail-rich as GTA V (makes sense with how much it cost to develop), but there are a lot of games with are just much more pleasurable to play.",

Many of them leave their house only to go to a minimum wage job and may not interact with women on a regular basis at all. So it comes across as particularly cruel to then tell those people that despite the fact that they spend their entire lives keeping to themselves and trying not to cause trouble, they're still somehow bad and sexist and part of the problem, etc. \n\nIt should be no surprise that when you make fun of losers, they'll get just a bit mad. From their position, you're a bully. Not a bully who could beat them up (especially not that bearded bastard who looks like a starving lumberjack), but a bully who uses his perceived charisma to deride them and treat them like pariahs.",

It's not sexist that there are no strong female leads in GTA. There are many games with only strong female leads too. Are those sexist towards men? No.",

            "commentText": "So just a question I respect every single point he made but what about gta online it's the main game mode and there you can make a female character and then give your character their own background to give them character.  Or what about CoD zombies, there are no female character and I don't think anyone would consider that sexist.  If you think about it like what if they replaced Michael with a girl then you'd have people going on about how the mission where he gets kidnapped by the triad gang would be promoting kidnapping or <b> sexual </b>assault or something or what if Trevor was replaced with a girl then people would complain about how that character would be seen as overly bitchy or that just because a female franklin would be seen as a stereotype (I know he is already) but more so like \"oh of course the<b>  black</b<b> > woma</b>n is single and in the ghetto\".  Regardless of how sexist you think the game is the character work together and yes some of the women don't seem have story arches but really when you look at it they do Michaels wife Changes for the betterment of their marriage, Trevor and madrazos wife become friends and franklin can find a girlfriend and get over his ex and yes their are strippers and prostitutes but in reality they relate to the main story. Again I respect the opinions presented and I mean no harm to the presenter or his ideas on the game these are just my opinions",

I'm pretty sure the thug-ish game genre is not very interesting to most girls, and if they are interested, I'm pretty sure they'd be fine playing a male character.

He makes great points.

This leads to people trying to write something attention catching, controversial and shocking. In response to your other point, I think you'll find a great difference between the two forms of game. Consider this: a novel and a poem are both forms of literature, both can take up great amounts of your time to analyse and enjoy. Would you group together people who love poetry and people who love novels? I wouldn't. People who enjoy poetry can obsess over the details of a single poem for lengths of time that I would find horrific. Meanwhile, a person who enjoys novels would need to go to an effort to return to a book, sitting down to read with a timeframe in mind because they don't want to be interrupted. The person may obsess over the story if they like it, really investing in characters and what's going to happen. These two don't translate perfectly and I must admit that my only experience of poetry nerds is from year 7 literature, but the point is the same. The two areas you're comparing are completely different yet happen to exist on the same medium. No middle-aged <b> woman </b>I know (or any<b>  woman</b> I know) would be interested in a picking up Bioshock infinite for a couple days or playing a game of COD MW3 with me or joining me for som<b> e elde</b>r scrolls online, and I know a lot of middle-aged women. Likewise, when they were all asking me what my high score on candy crush was, I said \"I don't play, sorry.\" I think that, were you to poll the amount of people from each group who think that they are the same, you would receive very little support from either group.",

Prejudice, to judge prior to knowing, is a human brain function that allows us to act on situations we cannot know the fullness of.

            "commentText": "The top comments on this video are pure cancer and I'm ashamed of all of you!!! Many of these comments not only mimic the exact cancer comments he showed examples of in the slideshow, but most of you clearly didn't even TRY to watch the video and understand the point he was trying to get across because you were so eager to find any and every fault you could just so you could say that he was wrong. This isn't about \"SJW's\" and you don't have to be \"liberal swine who's only doing the media's dirty work\" to see that <b> sexism </b>is a problem. And as a female who has been told numerous times that because I'm a girl I'm not \"allowed\" to like video games. As someone who has been told time and time again that because I have two x chromosomes that I can't succeed in my chosen field of game development, and as someone who has repeatedly, over and over, time and time again been told \"Video games aren't art\" or \"It's just a game, why does it matter?\" I can tell you with all the pain and wounds still fresh that this behavior is unacceptable. I am misrepresented in my medium of choice in a world that is evolving too quickly for me to just sit back and wait for change because if we don't work for equality the future will be bleak not just for me, not just for females, but for everyone. Video games have changed my life and they can change others' too but if they are to reach those who need them we must stop trying so hard to ostracize each other. That is how we grow as a society. You don't have to like me or him and you can call him a \"liberal\" and a \"hipster\" all you want but that doesn't detract from the underlying point of this video; that acceptance is important, and that just because a problem doesn't directly hinder YOUR life, doesn't mean that it's not a problem to address or that it shouldn't be solved.",

That being said, I feel that both people involved have valid points in some ways or others, and that the comparison is somewhat unnecessary as they are both striving towards similar goals. I just wish for less people proclaiming profoundly ridiculous points and acting immature in these comments (though this IS YouTube, so I shouldn't hold my breath) I do appreciate your input and I am certainly intrigued by this channel called \"Rags\" as I have not been exposed to it before, so I thank you for this.",

            "commentText": "\"Things need to be looked at through the prism of politics, <b> race,</b> etc to become art.\" Are you serious? I'm a musician/composer, and very little of my work is political. When trying to create something, you want it to be objective, or at least objective within the context of its story. The lifestyle and worldview of those within \"Grand Theft Auto\" is very different from the worldviews that we as every day people hold. Their value system is different, and thus we can't hold it to the same standard we hold for our lives. Why? Because it's a game. Shooter games don't cause people to be shooters, and games with hot women don't cause men to be misogynistic<b>  pigs</b>. \n\nWith that being said, if \"Grand Theft Auto\" is out to be a sandbox game centered around crime, city life and the harsh realities that come with it, I don't want its implications to be neutered for the sake of political correctness. To bring a game like this to its objective end, bring in the guns, the money, the prostitution, th<b> e se</b>x, the drugs, the works... A game should be able to achieve exactly what it wants for the sake of its intent, its demographic, and realism as it pertains to the reality depicted in the game.",

            "commentText": "I am a girl and I have played video games all my life. I have never felt as if women were objectified in any game I have played. I do not need to have played GTAV to know that the game is a parody of American culture and that is what it is: a parody. Just because you don't like a game doesn't mean suddenly no one can play it. Say for instance I'm a Christian, I think GTAV is a revolting game because of its swearing and violence. Should it be taken away from everyone and be banned then? No, because that's my opinion.\nNow I don't know much about real online gaming since I was guilty of being a nintendo kid for most of my life. I do remember playing Halo 3 when I was around 9 or 10 on Xbox live. I don't at all remember being called a girl (probably because I just sounded like another 12 year <b> old </b>boy) but I do remember I even made friends with teenagers on it. I don't at all remember even hearing any sexist comments at my female friends. But of course, this could have all just been blocked from my mind when I was little.\nThe game I currently play now online is Splatoon. I don't see any<b>  sexism</b> there AT ALL. In fact, more people choose the girl inkling rather than the boy because the only real difference is the hair. It's a game where I can literally pay no mind to who I'm playing against especially since there is no voice chat.\nI do hate that I am in the minority who play real games (not candy crush, that is revolting to me). An<b> d gende</b>r roles are very much evident in society. For example at my school there was a guys night and a girls night. The guys got to play video games. The girls watched cheetah girls... For my J-term, there are two out of the 15 options available that are guy only, none only for girls. The guys one was a bible fellowship thing (which is understandable since it's a christian school and boys and girls have different teaching needs). But the other was video games, paintball, and lazertag! Meanwhile the rest of them can be summed up as cooking, crafts, art, photography, and going to the city. Literally two of my friends were annoyed that this was a boys only option. But that's life and honestly, it can't be helped.",

            "commentText": "At the risk of getting my own Internet Rage responses, I agree with some of his points. But I will state two things beforehand: First, I have never and will never play a GTA game not because it is sexist, but because the concept sounds intensely boring to me. And second, the GTA series has a long history of being the series people use to point out problems, or blame for bad parenting. When GTA first came out it was thought to have influence teenagers into stealing cars. Now it's being used as an example of <b> sexism </b>in gaming. But GTA is not alone in its 'objective<b>  sexism</b>' issues either. \n\nAnd before you complain about the 'lack of agency for the male villains and henchmen' consider that you can make that complaint without it being taken as 'waging war on gaming'. No villain's are given 'agency', no henchmen given back stories. The same holds true when it is female villains, though there is a decided lack of female henchmen. Henchpersons? That's not really fair either, but it isn't worth arguing about when the female models in games as free and open as Skyrim still have men in pants for (most) of their armor styles, and women in skirts and fur bras. \n\nCan we take a moment to accept that the real complaint is not that women aren't present in so many games, it's that we depict them as targets and rewards in so many games? The issue is the narrative more so even than the fact that my female Hammer-wielding Nord in skyrim is still wearing a fur skirt. The narrative needs to alter. To adapt. And not even for all games. Just more games. \n\nHaving never played GTA games, I can safely state they will always be a target of critic and ridicule because the content of their sandbox. But they are a game that targets a specific group of people. Demographics in gaming is important to consider. But just imagine how much more money the gaming industry could make if more games were 'inclusive'. If I could run around as a BAMF female in GTA V, and beat the tar out of male prostitutes... Still doesn't sound like my kind of game, but I'm not their target demographic. \n\nAnd all this is before considering the sometimes toxic nature of gaming in MMOs toward female players. Often, when the male gamers discover they're in the presence of a female gamer, instead of talking about games, they start sexist jokes (\"put down that controller and pick up mine\") or it becomes a flirting competition, which can be creepier to hear than the sexist comments. When, really, that female gamer may just want to roll around and kill some stuff, do the quests, beat the tar out of that player there in a duel, and let the fact of their anatomical differences not impact their gaming experience. \n\nThat was a lot for a stupid youtube comment... But I feel he missed some important points and wanted to share... Now then, let the hate flow through you... xD",

Stereotypes gon' be everywhere, and they're really not gonna be detrimental to our REAL world if you have at least one brain cell in your head to ponder this. Let the stereotypes come and prove people wrong if you hate them so much, at least that's what I do. Quit whining on the Internet and start getting out there and actually contributing to the eradication of stereotypes\u2014which, personally, I don't mind much, as I am not a butthurt, idiotic leftist and find them rather comedic in 2017.\n\nAnd also, who cares if females don't play guy-intended games as much as males? Can we please just look at everyone at the individual level and STOP incorporating <b> gender </b>and, most annoyingly,<b>  race</b> into nearly everything? It really depends on the people themselves. Societal norms/expectations don't impact people when it comes to gaming, to be honest, so shut up SJWs.\u00a0Some people are interested in games, and some people simply aren't, like how some like reading and some don't. Society definitely plays a role in your life, but it doesn't determine you. We're not victims of social constructs, feminists. Stop making the problem bigger than it should be (doesn't relate to the video but I just wanted to get that off my chest). Look, man, if you're going to cry about the portrayal of women in a game, how about you visit Las Vegas yourself and take a look at all the billboards and posters? It's not that far from reality, just saying. But not the point, the point is to stop bringing freaking minorities into everything and treating men like the ultimate enemies; shut up about th<b> e patriarch</b>y and contribute something useful to our society, pleas<b> e. Sexi</b>sm <b> and rac</b>ism with all those SJWs running around is already bad as it is.",

            "commentText": "I'm all for stating one's opinion, trying to be objective, heck, even saying that GTAV is sexist if you really think that's true and you do find some information to prove your point. But misuse of actual information in a misleading way is not OK. Yes, the game has 3 male main characters. Is that sexist? Maybe. Why? Because the game developers are obviously trying to appeal to a male audience, probably thinking something along the lines of \"More men than women play videogames, so with these characters they can feel immersed\". But you'd be wrong. The only character that you're really supposed to feel \"immersed\" with is Franklin, and he's fucking <b> black.</b> Are you going to say that the game is<b>  racist</b> because the main protagonist isn't white? Of course not. Does that mean, then, that the game is sexist because he isn't <b> a woma</b>n? Of course not either. Franklin is the protagonist, Michael and Trevor are simply plot devices. Granted, you could argue that not being able to see the world through the eyes of<b>  a wom</b>an might be sexist, I'll give you that one.\n\nOn the blo<b> nde wo</b>man in a bikini thing, okay, I can see how you can see that as sexist, but that's just part of the franchise. It's a running thing. She's the icon of the game even if she doesn't appear in the game, because such characters have always been what have been used to represent the franchise. It's the way to make the game recognizable as part of the GTA franchise. It might be sexist, maybe, but it isn't there to serve the purpose of being sexist, it's there to serve the purpose of making the game recognizable.\n\nAnd on the quests that shame women... come on, don't get me started on this one. That quest is part of a quest chain in which you are pretty much forced into dealing with a paparazzi. The whole quest chain is portrayed in a bad light, and the character (Franklin) constantly comments on how fucked up what they're doing is. It's not trying to shame women, it's trying to portray how fucked up sensationalistic periodism is.",

Most of the women play completly other \"casual\" games. The women that play other games doesn't seem to have your problem otherwise they probably wouldn't play it. I don't play horror games but that doesn't mean that I want them to change. I just stick to the games I like. \n2. You clearly misrepresent gamer and most trolls in gaming are way younger than that guy between 13 and 15. Trashtalk is also <b> common </b>in gaming, you should know that. Its probably not very nice but it is not especially bad towards women.\n3. I personally think that the response to game Spot was understandable and just to be clear \"this<b>  woman</b>\" is something different than \"<b> a woma</b>n\" a lot of you feminist don't get that. She broug<b> ht Gend</b>er up first. Also a critic is not immune to critisim, happens all the time (remember gothic 3?). \n4. Since when is anyone safe from critisim. I what world where you living until now?\n5. The number of lead characters can't be sexist. That is not how sexim works.\n6. So they pai<b> d a wo</b>man to help them sell their game by doing what she does for a living? Dispicable.\n7. Reason 3: At this point i am wondering if you lack the abillity to see males in video games if they aren't a lead character. The same applies to men. This game is satire so it uses sterotypes. Also you can't give every bystander a elaborate backround. \n8. Reason 4: You play a criminal in that game that straight up murders people, but that is your problem? Sry but by you logic this game has to be misandrist because the lead goes more against males with much harder crimes, or would you have prefered it, if the mission would have been to murder thos women?\n9. If you like building straw men so much, why don't you become a farmer.\n10. You don't decide what satire is. \n11. If your looking for raw models gta is really not a good place to look for anyone. But why should it be. Educate your kids yourself.\n12. You admit that they are good female lead in video games. Why do you think that it is important that every game is the same? That is what i am getting from you.\n13. Punch people who disagree with you mindset. In the year 2014 a joke in the year 2017 a bitter reality. \n14. You are really into that women are from venus man are from hell thing are you? \nAre you really a gamer?",

Prostitution and stripping largely exist because of a lack of other economic opportunities. To not include them wouldn't make much sense in terms of the overall themes of GTA.",

They shouldn't be ugly but they shouldn't be too pretty. They shouldn't dress like a Cromwell era housewife but they can't dress too slutty. They should be proud to be female and be proud of their body but they shouldn't show their body off too much so they attract the \"male gaze\". They should be physically strong but not too strong or they'll just be a man with boobs. They should be emotionally strong but at least still a little sensitive to show they still have a feminine side. They should be a leader of men but at the same time shouldn't be too bossy in case it perpetuates stereotypes of women being micromanaging control freaks. They should be proud to have free sexuality but at the same time they cannot just sleep with male members of the cast for funsies ala <b> Zero </b>from Drakengard 3 because that idea might expand dong. All these contradictory ideas. \n\nIf were a game dev I'd just make a guy my protagonist. What does the guy character have to be? Well he can either be a stunningly handsome manly man or a complete clown, it doesn't really matter as long as he fits the tone of the game I'm making.

Again, like i said it is a very offensive game a lot of games are like that such as deadpool (which is a game), duke nukem forever, left for dead series, i could go on; the point is are these most of these game companies likely to change the answer is no especially not Rockstar mostly when it comes to GTA cuz it's always going to be offensive as shit, the more you're triggered the happier they are.",

The basis of the most of your arguments within this game are prostitution and shaming female activists while profiting, but both of those simply reinforce the idea that your a criminal. Anything that you would say is wrong and sexist about the game may be right, but it should still be there as it is an integral part of the games ideal.",

WTF? Also, you act as if now girls are all coming out in swathes and are only playing video games now? No, we have always played videogames. But the games they play are statistically different to those boys play (boys=shooter, girls=journey as an example- this wasn't just pulled out of my arse either) and thus are generally less likely to play online games among other boys in things like FPSs. I know it isn't impossible just to play one genre, but stereotypes are prejudice based in truth. HOWEVER, even this is an outdated statistic, most people who play video games don't give a shit if your a guy, girl or attack helicopter. If you can kill the other team, then your all good.",

            "commentText": "Garbage human beings posting garbage comments on the internet do not reflect on the game itself. You don't go around looking at comments on the reviews of other media and talk about how those forms of media are sexist. Top reasons these things are an issue is because with the internet comes no accountability and with no accountability comes people of all ages (most notably young kids) talking all kinds of trash because there are no repercussions. \n\n\"GTA V was a good game but it would have been great with female characters in it.\" So, a great game is the difference between having a female character and not having a female character? You don't go around to books and movies saying \"Hmm, this would be great if only it had a female in it.\" hell, half the movies I watch, even today in 2017 don't pass the Bechtel test.\n\nHe made a Game of Thrones reference, I just want to point out that if Game of Thrones was written and designed originally as a video game it would be the single handed most hated and controversial game of all time guaranteed, but make it a book and TV series and suddenly it's the greatest thing ever. Anyone else see the problem here? It's because people are still viewing video games as childish and \"just games\" when they're not. They're capable of so much more and I'm tired of everyone (\"gamers\" or not) saying otherwise.",

GTA is a game for MEN, most triple A and real games are for MEN, because men buy and play games - women buy and play casual weak games.\n\nIf you said the of men to women ratio on GTA is about 80% men, maybe I would believe, but on most games, not even 20% are women, except mobile games.\n\nAlso, GTA is not a sandbox, that is so wrong I can't keep on watching this.",

Same as the game doesn't turn people into murderers and criminals by letting the player kill people and steal cars. This whole talk is just plain stupid and incredibly biased. In a game where the main character kills thousands of people, steals cars and robs banks, u get upset that they mistreat women? How can you not see how ridiculous this is? The characters are not role models, they are anti role models, so them not being sexist would probably be more problematic than them being sexist. You're fine with the characters being murdering lunatics, just so long as they treat women with respect? Gimme a break.\nAlso, what is wrong with sexuality in games?

            "commentText": "I am pretty tired of hearing arguments along these lines.  Paul admits in this talk that respectable and powerful women have literally hundreds of examples across the board, but he spends 10 minutes talking about a single example of <b> sexism </b>in games.  (There are more, sure, but it is such a tiny percentage of the overall game market)\u00a0 This is akin to me bitching about there being no gunfights in the latest RomCom.  If you find the content objectionable, don't play the game.  It's very simple.  There are literally millions of games you could choose from.  You talked about games being a form of art, yet people are trying to pressure the artists into compromising on thier artistic freedoms to create what they want to create.  It doesn't matter if that content alienates a certain group or not, it is thier work, and they should be free to include whatever they want.  I really don't see this level of backlash in other forms of media, most people tend to just avoid that which they find objectionable, but when it comes to games, developers have to walk on fucking eggshells as to not upset feminists, SJWs, LGBTs, or people like me, those that just want to be able to pick and choose from all the options available and decide what I would like to play that won't annoy or offend me.  What I don't do is try\u00a0to censor and shame people who make or play anything with content I find objectionable.  As Paul said with regards to feminism,\u00a0it's not about one side\u00a0being held above the other, yet this is exactly what you are asking for.  You are asking for people that have a problem with things in\u00a0games such as GTA to be catered to above people that don't have a problem with it.  Censoring things that make you feel uncomfortable, well, that isn't how artistic freedoms work.  Again, there are literally millions of games to choose from,\u00a0play something\u00a0you like.  I\u00a0kind of want to play minecraft, but the blocky pixelated graphics are annoying and offensive to me.  Hey Mojang, could you please change the way you render your game so I can actually be included?  This is your argument.  I am not sexist,<b>  racist</b>, bigoted, or whatever other label you want to throw around, and as studies have shown, playing games with a certain kind of content isn't going to have much, if any affect on a healthy mind.  If you start trying to dictate what is o.k. and what is not, free speech and expression dies, in fact, look around, it IS dying a little more every day.  Everytime a director edits thier movie, or a developer cuts content due to pressure from some organized group, or someone is forced to delete a youtube video because they said something that someone else didn't like, that is\u00a0the path we are on, everything will just be bland and boring as to not offend anyone.",

So of course it would be around 50 percent. because women make up about 50 of the population and almost everyone plays games on their phone\n\n(B) yeah, I'll admit people were WAY over reacting with death threats and trying to get he fired. That's screwed up\n\n(C) the \"you can not interact with them thing is kinda pointless. Of course you can't really interact with them meaningfully because you can't really do that with anyone\n\n(D) to your point about the paparazzi thing, there's a difference between a character being sexist and the thing depicting the character being sexist. If a character is sexist and the game doesn't show that the action is bad, or that the character is bad (which would by extension make the actions of said character bad) then the game is sexist. However, the game does show that the characters are bad. They are literally drug dealing murderers all of whom are some combination of ex-bankrobber, gangster, or smuggler.\n\n(E) to your point about the women not getting these big backstories, of course they don't. You said so yourself that they weren't major or impactful. So why would they spend all that time making a backstory for a character that doesn't matter.",

The wife has a crafts (aka pintrest) room and walk in closets that she loves.  The husband has a man cave, that he loves.  \n\nThey throw a party, and a hipster shows up as a +1.  Said hipster starts loudly complaining about how the man cave is unfair.  Saying that they should convert it into a reading nook and a family room instead.  \n\nThe husband says that he thinks it's fair for him to have  his man cave to himself, because his wife has her crafts room to herself.  \n\nThe hipster says he's a sexist who deserves to be punched in the face.\n\n\n\nMaking products that specifically appeal to men is not being sexist against women.  It is providing to a market.  And before you try to say that women are not being served, remember that, as he said in the video, 47% of people who play games are already women.  Women's gaming needs are being met already; it just happens that the games women gravitate towards are different on average.  Stop trying to shame men for liking what they like.",

            "commentText": "He makes decent points, the problem is that all of these talking points are destroyed when put into context.  GTA Online which is obviously the reason most people play the game allows players to create female characters that don't have to be over sexualized or they can if the player chooses.  This is choice and this is one obvious reason the game is not sexist.  Secondly, he states that the men are given back stories as to why they're monsters and that in the end they come of as roguish human beings.  Trevor one of the leads never receives a story like this and is always seen throughout the entire game as a sociopath and a homicidal maniac.  They never provide a reason for why he ended up that way.  In fact, none of the male characters are ever perceived as an every day individual, after all that would take away from the premise which is satire.   And yes it is actually satire.  Everything in the game is satirized from Weazel News to the ridiculous tv shows.  No one is safe in GTA.  He might think he has an argument by saying \"I've talked to my comedian friends about satire\" but their individual definitions of satire does not change it's existing one.  Satire doesn't always have to be subtle.  In many ways it's thrown in your face, just look at Monty Python.  All of the male leads are in fact, sociopaths with very bad life choices.  Shit, even Michael has a mid life crisis and starts robbing places again because he became complacent and miserable with his rather relaxed way of life.  Thirdly, the female characters are given a reason as to why they act the way they do and IMO, because the only way to view it is subjectively not objectively, are more humanized than the male leads.  The reason Amanda acts the way she does is because she is also dissatisfied with her way of life, she misses the excitement Michael used to provide and is upset with him because he lays around and bitches rather than actually doing something with himself.  Tracy acts the way she does because neither Michael or Amanda are involved in her life resulting in her becoming a spoiled self entitled <b> brat,</b> just like Jimmy.  Anyone who has been involved in a relationship that amounts to something more than \"Yes honey Whatever you want honey\" knows and understands that something similar (by similar I mean on a smaller or sometimes larger scale) happens in every relationship and every couple goes through a point like this.  I could go into loads more detail about how he is wrong, but I would need a proper format to do so.  All his opinions about the game show is that he either never played it or was too busy picking out its faults to pay attention to the story and character development.  Video games are an art form.  That's what they are.  No one picks apart Eminem's songs because they occasionally contain sexist remarks, they analyze the entire song, and the story they tell that explain why those sexist remarks are there.  That's the point.  Context is key, and this guy completely missed it.",

If it doesn't appeal to you, don't play it. You're also assuming it only appeals to men, when in fact it appeals to women despite the portrayal... so what's more sexist? The game? or this guy shaming \"stupid men that should be punched in the face\" telling them their game should change because it's not how we want it?... This video is shaming those that have an opposite opinion of the people reviewing the game, and look at his approach, he basically said all gamers ar<b> e fa</b>t slobs that violate women and post negativity. Equality in everything is impossible when billions of people are involved. This presentation is only ventilation of his feelings, without any proof of his words as fact. He criticizes their insults with insults and joking encouragement of physical harm to them to then apologize for all men... again assuming all men a<b> re du</b>mb sexist slobs... His presentation is just a troll..",

Example, the Tomb Raider series. Guys are sexualized in video games too, but generally in different ways since women usually find things other than showing skin to be sexy. Example, Nathan Drake from Uncharted. People are stupid when they are anonymous online, and guys have a habit of hitting on girls and trying to be cooler when they are in that position. IT'S. NOT.<b>  SEXISM</b>. IT'S SILLY HUMANITY MUDDLING THROUGH, TRYING THEIR BEST, AND MESSING UP.  The best way to fight the problem is to pick up and move on to be more mature, and let the people learn that they are being immature. No social justice, no crying wolf, and certainly not stripping away creative freedom to fit someone else's context of good.",

Video games were largerly shunned by the wider society and girls in particular. You were a \"geek\" and kinda gross and stuff.\n\nBoys quickly made this their space and now that games have lost this negative \"nerd\" connotation (nerd has actually become something of a fashion statement these days) women now have become \"brave \"enough to enter the space that has been taken care of by men all these years and DEMAND special status from the get go.\n\nAnd no one says girl gamer anymore either, you are 10 years late to the party m8.\n\nGet your history right, hipster douche. \n\nSo happy that Gamergate happened and now that we see SJ bullshit spilling from the virtual world into the real world (see campus activism these days), we can see the real shits for what they are.",

            "commentText": "If almost 50% of the gamers are female, then they clearly don't care. So why is this hipster talking \"for\" us. \n\nHere's an idea: If women hate <b> sexism </b>in gaming so much, why not...oh I don't know: MAKE YOUR OWN GAMES!\nThere are plenty of women already doing that. (Portal, Assassin's Creed etc.)\n\nAnd a lot of forms of art are sexist: Movies, paintings, sculptures, most of the operas, plays and ballets. Yet we motivate kids to go see these forms of art. Yes these things were made in a different time where<b>  sexism</b> was ok, but you don't see that written down on the information sign next to a painting. You don't read in a review about Orfeo et Euridice that they portray th<b> e woma</b>n as weak. You read about how well they portrayed the story. (Yes, videogames are a form of are if they have a good storyline,\u00a0 distinguished style of graphics or an unique form of gameplay, but do you consider MK to be art? Maybe the art of ripping someone's spleen out through his nostril...but actual art? Nah...<b> )\n\nSexi</b>sm in videogames is bullshit. There is a reason why there is<b>  an </b>age restriction on certain games. Because Rockstar thinks that we gamers can distinguish the difference between a game and reality. And in 99% of the games you do things that are bad, illegal, sexist,\u00a0 etc.\u00a0 You don't write a review about COD and say: \"Yeah, all those guys shooting is a really bad think. Shooting is bad....blah blah blah.\"\u00a0 We know it's bad, and that's why we do it in a videogame. GTA in this example is 18+. All gamers and yes, also the men, know it's just a game and won't start treating women in real life any differently than they did before the game. \nAlso Assassin's Creed(developed by women) never had a female protagonist up until Syndicate. (Not counting the port.) AC has always been\u00a0misogynistic.\u00a0Always the masculine protagonist saving the ladies. (Especially Ezio.)\n\u00a0\nAs a female gamer I've never experienced negativity towards women. Yes we do get a little extra attention, but never negative. Male gamers are also adjusting to the fact more and more women play videogames. Almost every game has\u00a0a online mode these days and when they notice a female playing on the other\u00a0side, they are often surprised but friendly and positive.\u00a0\n\nTo be fair: The comments on that review are horrible. But I don't think mentioning that it's sexist, is needed. Gamespot also made a review about Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 and not once is mentioned how scarcely the\u00a0 heroines are dressed or anything about their...ehm...proportions. (<3 Rachel) \n\nThe comments are terrible but I do feel this lady was just jumping on<b>  the se</b>xism train like all those damn hipsters these days. (Just like this man.) \n\nPlease just let me blow up strip clubs and drive over hookers in peace. Because of these people, soon, videogames all need to be politically correct and shit. One of the reasons I play videogames is to escape real life, don't bring real life into my videogame. (If I want that, I'll just play the Sims..;-) )",

Don't <b> dumb </b>down games to something that idiotic. More reasonable stats to look at would be for example, the 2% of women who play sports games,  7% who play FPS and 10% who play MOBAs. That's a realistic picture of gaming.\n\n2. \"Games needs to be looked at through the prism of politics,<b>  race</b> an<b> d gende</b>r.\" No, they really don't. Games are fantasy, and the creators should be free to create imaginary worlds how ever they want. GTA shouldn't be critiqued for containi<b> ng sexi</b>sm more than Counter Strike should be critiqued for containing \"men portayed as violent\" or \"too much guns\". Clearly this hipster has trouble differentiating games and reality. Showing violence in a game doesn't justify or promote the act violence, even 5 year olds understand that.\n\n3. He claims that \"we\", meaning the gaming community want games to be considered \"art\". That's rediculous, and that's just his own personal hipster opinion. Games are entertainment, that does not equal art. There is art in the form of games, but that's not even close to the same thing.\n\n4. Implying that the vocal minority of 9 000 gamers, is a good representation of a community of hundreds of millions of gamers. No, we are not all insecure brats who can't stan<b> d a transgen</b>der game reviewer. We all hate hipsters who disgrace our community with bullshit though.\n\n5. These stupid jokes. Come on, it's a TED talk, have some respect. The listeners don't want to see your fucking memes (that you clearly don't even understand by the way).",

            "commentText": "1). Yes, they do cater mostly to men, because most actual gamers are men. Sure, 50% of people who play video games are women, but that's only if you include mobile gamers, and casual gamers. The gamers who generally spend money, are generally hardcore gamers, and those are mostly MEN. And no, playing mobile games don't count you as a gamer, just as throwing instant- noodles into the microwave doesn't make you a cook. A certain degree of interest in devotion is needed in a subject.\n2). Most famous game developers are men, sure. But <b> nothing </b>is stopping women from designing games. If less women choose to make video games, there will (obviously) be less female developers.\n3). \"Girl gamer\" is a term some people use online in the gaming community. If you are so sensitive as to the point that you feel harassed when someone calls you a \"girl gamer\", then stop playing games. The gaming community has some people that will say some rude things, and if you can't take shit like that, and just ignore or get over it, then the internet isn't a place for you.\n4). \"You can't choose not to be a sexist prick\" in GTA 5. Sure you can. As you said, in a sandbox, or open-world type game, you do with it what you will. You can<b>  race</b> around the roads, install the LSPDFR mod...etc, but point being, you make with it what you will.\n5). Yes, people don't like it when ridiculous feminists cry \"objectification<b> , sexis</b>m\" in games. Sure, you might not like what they put on billboards/on the radio stations...etc, but that's a minor nitpick far and away removed from the missions, and open-world activities that encompass the game's major features. It's also ridiculous to claim that this game is purely sexist towards women and portrays them poorly, when most of the male characters are druggies, criminals, and would most likely be serving time in jail, in the real world. Yes, it's her job, but when she makes ridiculous arguments like that, people do have a legitimate reason to want her fired, and give criticism like that. Now death threats are crossing the line, but can you purely say that's because they're<b>  a wom</b>an, <b> and transgen</b>der, at that? Most people who say things online, and indeed many celebrities, get death threats. It's because the internet is full of people who do shit like that.\n6). No, being a man doesn't make you exempt from criticism. I think we can tell from the unusually high number of dislikes,  and the comments section here.\n7). Having 3 male leads doesn't make a game sexist. Same as having three female leads. Especially not when they are portrayed as criminals, and shadowy underground crime bosses. Just having three leads from one group doesn't mean that other groups are discriminated against, it just means that those leads happen to be male. There's little doubt that people wouldn't be crying \"sexist\" if there were three female leads.\n8). Having a beaut<b> iful w</b>oman on a poster doesn't qua<b> lify \"s</b>exism\". It means that people have a reasonable, and completely tolerable quality of admiring beautiful people.\n9). I don't know how you can cry about \"depiction of women\" when men are once again, depicted as mostly criminal. And yes, you can't interact with them, because they're like movie extras. The point is, they're here to trigger an event that must happen, and when that is done, they leave the picture.\n10). That's not sexist, that's just blatantly stupid. Two different categ<b> ories. </b>Sexism is discrimination ag<b> ainst a</b> gender, specifically for the reason they <b> are tha</b>t gender. You haven't proven causation, simply correlation.\n11). If you make ridiculous claims such as \" so and so game was sexist\", when it wasn't, you'd be rightfully attacked. Some may choose to send threats- st<b> upid, b</b>ut common online for anyone who is to any degree famous, attacks such as \"you're shit\", o<b> nce aga</b>in, common online, or factual criticism. Backlash against unfair crit<b> icism i</b>sn't sexism, it's fair, and understandable self-defense of a community\n12).Why should developers have to cater to your needs, and put women as their lead? Same <b> for men</b>! The gender of a protagonist is hardly an issue paramount to the quality of a game.\n13). Feel free to punch them? Hardly a good talking point for people who complain of fake violence against women in games, to advocate real violence against a mostly male audience. Hypocritical, no?\n14). No. No one is stopping women from playing games. If they wanted to play or develop games, they could go right ahead. It's more of a crowd of people who chat and interact, who happen to be mostly men. Your analogy is moot. Furthermore, the claim that \"the air smells fresher, everything is nicer\" when girls are around, compared to when boys around, is a bit sexist, don't you think?",

            "commentText": "No WRONG! 1:42 minuets into the video and you're WRONG! The\"only\" video game company(like you said) that caters to girls and boys are Nintendo. That's because the games that THEY make(Like you said) is targeted towards the nuclear family. \nHere's the problem. Candy crush and other mobile games are played mostly by females, yes. But not big titles. You know... The largest part of the video game industry. \n\nWe would love to see more girls in video gaming, gaming overall. But that won't happen if people like you spread lies and miss informed statements that the video game industry is sexist. Try convincing a yew that video gaming is cool.. If all they've heard all their lives bin lies about how video game industry is antisemitic. If you wanna talk about a sexist industry go talk about porn, where a male actor gets paid 10% of what a female actress does... Oh wait, that's not even sexist. It's called supply and demand. And there are reasons to everything looking the way it does. \n\nNo WRONG! 2:34 minuets into the video and you're WRONG! Females make up most of the video game demographic, if you count mobile gaming and Facebook games. You and people that think like you(Carolyn) are the real sexists here and I quote \"A girl gamer carries with it connotations of vulnerability, innocence and youth\"... No one thinks like this anymore! And the thing about Grand Theft Auto 5 making 1 billion dollars. That shows why the industry is shaped like it is. \n\n6:50: Are you trying to say.. In over thousands of comments. You saw no good ones? Did I ever call you a lair? So what? she or he's a female or a male. I can't say. I just don't think that technology has come far enough for a person to truly change <b> gender.</b> But I can call Carolyn  her if she wants me to and this is why I can tell that you're lying. Most gamers react like me! We are just mad that people like you fling lies at our hobby that can't even stick to begin with. But people takes it as truth and it hurts gamers over all. \n\n8:30: Supply and demand. Why can't girls play the game because there are 3 male leads? Oh! Oh! Go do this but with the hip-hop industry! That's one of the reasons why GTA 5 looks the way it does. \n\n9:35: How meany games were sold thank to that poster? Tell me that and this might be an argument.\n\n9:56: The hole game actively shames men.\n\n10:20: What would happen if you hit a dog over and over again for over a long period. It would grow annoyed and angry with you. That's why gamers are reacting the way they are. Maybe it's not a good reason, but it's still a reason. Unlike you.\n\n10:46: Have we? I see it more as a sport. But I can maybe see how some games could be considered art... BOT GRAND THEFT AUTO 5!\n\n11:30: You just answered why gamers react the game they do. \n\nMy answers are you getting shorter and shorter. Think silence will be enough from here.",

Most of the guys I know would probably jump at the chance to game with a girl, and they would KILL to have a gamer girlfriend. The farthest I've personally seen on the other side of the spectrum is where guys are just pleasantly surprised to find out that women they know are gamers. So, I'm not saying that this isn't a problem. But, the problem is mainly with the online trolls- in day to day life, I think that the idea of female gamers is really accepted by the consumers (leaving the developers out of this).",

Ok now. \nGTA 5 is not intentionally sexist, and there is one someone reason for this, rockstar games is a company and simply not including a <b> gender </b>would extremely danger sales.\nNow I will abstain from going too in depth as this is a view shown by most of the actual \"gaming community\", \nNow on the talk itself, gamers are not just \"smelly boys\" \"shaking their fists\" at women in gaming. This is the problem so many people like u bring up, generalisation, the mean<b>  age</b> of a gamer is 33, and make, so we are not \"boys\" and it has been proven to have positiv<b> e menta</b>l effects so this general view is highly insulting and this agism can be argued to be as bad as t<b> he sexi</b>sm you complain about, actually I wrote an essay recently  bringing up the point. The generalisation of an entire group taking part in an activity is not as socially ingrained<b>  as sex</b>ism but still is a major problem and something that needs to be delt with. And might I say this is what infuriates the real gaming community. So the next time u speak of now one group is so terrible remember that the ppl u are belittling are just as much a community as the one you are trying so desperately to protect. And have just as much of a voice as your own, and we can scream and shout, to fight for OUR equality and recognition, remember that before generalising, you may piss off a lot of ppl",

NO its not ok to put down the female  down for saying a game is sexist,\u00a0us men and women have a right to video games and to give women death threats and tell them there shit and worthless for pointing out stuff like this in video games i feel is wrong, we need to be treated more equal in the gaming comity sure there might be some sexist games and people might be offend but either way it doesn't  give you a right to start sending death threats and making fun of a person just cause they disagree a little. and yes girls can be gamers to stop acting  judgemental people",

                    "commentText": "Kaylen Wanstall Oh. Well, in the eyes of marketers, it's incredibly important, as they know who to market to. Scientifically speaking, across wide trends of people, there are not insignificant differences between the sexes. Generally, males will enjoy more action-y, competitive games, and women won't. This doesn't mean there aren't any women that play those games, obviously, and that all male gamers play those games, obviously, but it is a simple generalization. Heck, I know multiple women that enjoy those types of games, and since I frankly suck, they're all probably better than I am, but still.\nAgain, there are many exceptions, but apparently not enough to make marketers switch tactics.\n\nWith what you say about bashing the reviewer... It's bad and immature, but that's gonna be something that won't stop. I doubt it has anything to do with the <b> sex </b>of the reviewer either, and more with the fact that she said GTA should be docked for being sexist, which, obviously, is like getting upset about<b>  racism</b> in media taking place in the 1800's.... it's gonna happen. In fact, while I agree that you shouldn't ever get mad at people for disliking a part of a game, the way you phrased it almost makes it seem like you're suggesting that when it's a girl that's especially bad, which sounds like a double standard. If that's not what you meant, you're free to clarify, lol. I don't wanna twist your words.",

Of course it's not really in there hands to address theres issues cause all they did is make the video game,  anyway my main point in the comment is to just understand we as gamers are equal to play whatever games you want no matter if your a male or female and that it's not right to make fun of a girl for staeing there oppioen on a video game we could go on for hours with this conversation but I think there's enough to be said now",

A poll, i guess, then to that i can say that most girls i met in my life would tell me that they never had a close approach to gaming (sorry if with \"gamer\" you meant \"plays angry birds on the bus ocasionally\", but in that case it's wrong) and boys, on the other hand, always tell me that they do have close approachs and constantly. I'm not here to shame casual gamers, but i see that your point in the whole thing is that video DEVELOPERS are wrong for having their main customer as a <b> fat </b>guy, and the only way that this customer idea can change a game developer's ways is that we are talking about a serious long game, not a casual one (for ex, angry birds: how can the main customer's image change the game in that case? It changes<b>  nothing</b>).",

            "commentText": "Calling a game company misogynistic because it had no female characters in their game is as ridiculous and hyperbolic as calling a white <b> woman </b>who does not want to have<b>  sex</b> with blacks <b> a racis</b<b> >t na</b>zi. Maybe a female character just didn't work in the context of GTA V? How many female gangsters have you actually seen running from the police, beating up people for their phones, doing drive-by shootings or committing vandalism? It's men who do that stuff 99% of the time. Women are relegated to the more gentle gangster activities, like transporting cocaine stuffed up their bungholes. Instead of trying to incriminate the company it would be far better to merely state your disappointment that you could once again not play as a female and that hopefully in the next game they will try harder to create a cool and believable female character. Lots of guys actually like playing as females, heck I ALWAYS play RPG games as female characters if I have a choice; Fallo<b> ut, El</b>der Scrolls, Dark Souls... You name it! -Because they are always hot and I prefer to spend 300 hours staring at a sexy girl's toned butt in tights as opposed that of a hairy dude. I just don't expect games to put girls arbitrarily where they don't belong or where they will come off as unrealistic.",

I am completely against<b>  sexism</b>, to females and males, but this seems a little bit ridiculous. If women we put in the thuggish roles, in which the main characters in GTA are, there would be another reason for people to complain through the misrepresentation of women. It feels like this guy is complaining for the sake of complaining. I do fully acknowledge that there is an issue o<b> f sexis</b>m within game development and the gaming communities but this guy at some point, who is meant to be an informed and objective critic, seems to be complaining to impress an audience. There is tons <b> of sexi</b>sm to both genders in video games and that needs to be sorted but I feel this speaker is going the wrong way about it by attempting to demonise game developers and the gaming community.",

Yeah, the game doesn't exactly treat women nicely, but it's not much kinder to its male characters, who are all either remorseless criminals, <b> fat </b>nerds, stereotypical hipsters, fatter nerdier nerds, corrupt manipulative assholes, inbred hillbillies, complete physchopaths or any combination of the eight, and arguing that GTA is sexist against women when it treats men equally shitty just seems like grasping at straws. I mean, this is a game about criminals, you're not exactly going to see any saintly figures here, whether it be male or female.\n\nAnd equating promotional material to the game is illogical. Two completely different teams are in charge of marketing and the actual production of the game, slapping the sexist label onto the developers because of a fuckup from marketing is just<b>  dumb</b>.",

They're mixing the casuals with the hardcores (mainly to warp statistics but that's a whole different can of worms), and the AAA gaming companies cater mainly to the hardcores, which happen to be mostly men. Getting butthurt over gaming companies catering to their own audiences is like getting angry at a pastry shop for not putting enough shards of glass in their cakes and discriminating against the select few people who like having their mouth lacerated. Sure, some people might like eating glass, but most of their customers are not going to like eating a shard of glass. AAA gaming companies aren't going to cater to groups that aren't their primary audience for the same reason a marathon runner wouldn't start a <b> race </b>by shooting himself in the kneecap. They'd just be making it unnecessarily hard on themselves.",

Or has it change to where you HAVE to play a type of game to be called gamer? I was in the middle 90s and grew up with video games; I didn't care what it was cause I had fun playing it. I feel like we are losing gamers cause we cling to a type of platform only fanbase who will insult anyone with a different system then them. I think we should use <b> old </b>term gamer as to someone who plays a lot of games, not what system they own and what is better. Cause game that comes out won't be on that platform.

But i do like first person shooter games! like fallout 4 where I can be a female avatar and there aren't prostitutes. They lost me on the prostitute's it reminds me of when i was a much younger version of myself playing doom for the first time on pc and stumbling on the in game strip club.  It left a bad taste in my mouth and i didn't finish the game. The only kind of uncomfortable i want to feel in a game is if im pretty sure im about to step on a bomb but i cant see it. Women would be more likely to play games if the market wasn't strictly geared twords men. How likely am i to buy a game with a half naked lady on the cover? Not so much... i even stopped playing games where male armor is displayed super discreet where you only see their head if they dont have a helm but women armor of the same kind is more like a bikini.... We like playing games too and i assure you if i were on the bus and i had my laptop and a good internet connection i would be scrounging the wastelands however mobile apps cant complete maybe instead of complaining about her candy crush mobile app show her a better one like amcs walking dead or clash of kings or something. Why don't you find us in game? Most serious female gamers pose as men in mmo myself included. Why? Because you dont take us seriously or you throw so much loot at us it breaks the game for us and then when we get really good you take the credit for it. So you know what? Whatever dude!",

Furthermore there are virtually no female roles besides bag lady and stripper in the game. There are also female heros in real life so are male strippers. I get that its a parody geared twords men but they left out a huge untapped market. It was a good game but it wasnt as epic as it could have been with a little inclusion. Add a few cool female NPCs and some male strippers and it would have been golden smh",

Its like comparing someone who kinda goes to the gym maybe once or twice a week and someone who is ripped and goes everyday. The simple fact is mobile gaming and pc/console gaming are vastly difference in almost every way. Mobile games depend on micro-transactions to profit and do not take long in development. While the most played game on Pc/Consoles are the multi-plat games such as Witcher 3 and GTA 5. They are usual years in development and take millions of dollars to make. Pc/Console game depend on people buying them at much higher prices anywhere from $40-$60 of upfront cost that doesn't even include DLC or season passes.",

The 47% seems a little high to me though, and I suspect that if you did it by hours played you would see the number drop a lot.  The main reason I find the idea strange is that where are these so called female gamers hiding?  I've met a few of them, but not anywhere near as many as I have men.  I'm all for more women in gaming.  I want more than anything to find a girl that shares my interests, and gaming is a big interest of mine.  I have actively looked for female gamers, and I just can't find all that many of them, or when I do find them, they are not nearly as into the games as I am, and I know many many guys play games at the same level I do.  But yeah, I have real doubts about that 47% claim.  I'm pretty sure at least half that number is girls who only kind of like video games, or ones that pretend to like them in order to get guys.  That is a real problem, and something that really pisses off all the actual female gamers I know.",

People who truly love a medium or an artform should be the most critical of it. Speaking out against <b> sexism </b>in games does not mean you are trying to take fun out of games. If<b>  sexism</b> is fun to someone then they need to assess why they find that enjoyable and think about the negative effects on themselves and others.\n\nThe whole reaction to this video down here in the comments pretty much exactly proves his point. Certain people off in a corner end up feeling threatened and look to stagnate intellectual and artistic growth. They treat ideas like social equality, which every reasonable person should be in favor of, with not just a skepticism towards specific ideas or claims but rather a general disdain for the entire goal. That's a sad view to hold about something like that<b> . Nothin</b>g in this video will make games worse for you. Discussi<b> ng sexi</b>sm in games will make games better and will make more people enjoy games. These are good things.",

There are quests for everything, the reason that happened in a quest is to show how Hollywood is and the paparazzi are. Again..<b> .. s</b>ex sells....\nThen you list stereotypical responses of gamers of the questions. \nAll in all paul, you thought you could make your break by doing this Ted Talk. But really, it showed that you were the same as theses \"sexist games\". Stereotyping \"gamers\"<b>  as </b>fat lazy people. \n(Lastly, uses suspenders correctly)",

It's a great satire on American(ized) culture in general; you don't satirize blatant idiocy with a scalpel. The characters, though stereotypes, are highly recognizable. And the game is rated M for \"mature\": this alone should tell feminists to steer clear of it.",

            "commentText": "by 1:17 he's already decided not to attack sexist sentiments, but the people who may or may not hold them.\n\n@ ~2:00 he asserts game studios rarely consider female gamers as a potential target audience, this is something we already know to be untrue. one need look no further than the ad campaigns that currently exist for games. take, for instance, CoD's recent efforts to provide a nearly even split between the genders when representing it's playerbase in it's ads. \n\n@ ~2:40 he presents the thinly veiled straw-man of \"male gamers hate female gamers\". however he never provides any evidence for this claim. nor does he recognize it even as a claim. this is hardly surprising as his argument would otherwise fall apart.\n\nhis entire rant on GTA-V. im sorry, but what was the point. i feel like his issue is that you can only play as male d-bags. but if that's the case then he presents his central premise last then provides <b> zero </b>supporting evidence before hastily moving to talk about this game reviewer. how is this what makes it into a ted-talk? GTA-V tells a story about a group of male d-bags. it's the story that was written and it simply didn't include a playable<b>  woman</b> because the story didn't need one. that's no<b> t sexis</b>m that's artistic integrity.\n\n\"very fair review\"? well you've only really established that you agree with the review. now, I've not personally read this review because i don't go to gamestop for reviews. or anything really. but we're just forced, AGAIN, to take you at your word here.\n\nah yes, let's cherry pick comments. frankly i'd rate GTA-V significantly lower than a 9 or 10, not that i think it's bad, or that it would matter. but this is the definition of anecdotal. it prov<b> es nothi</b>ng relevant to the overall discussion. \nbut you go on step further and include what is obviously a troll comment.\n\ni was waiting for the death threats bit. let me be clear about this, EVERYONE RECEIVES DEATH THREATS. caroline did, anita sarceesian did, donald trump has, you probably have. I'VE RECEIVED DEATH THREATS AND IM A FUCK<b> ING NOB</b>ODY. yes a bit anecdotal, but i'm talking about what is a clearly defined trend. though, to be fair, so is hateful responses to 3rd-wave-feminism, so i guess your comment readout gets a pass. well, at least the 2/3 that aren't trolls.\n\n8:30 into the talk and we are only now going to be presented with what the presenter conciders to be objective evidence. impressive.\nreason 1 - 3 male leads. good news, i've already rebuffed this. how unfortunate it must be to be so predictable.\nwhile we're at it im going to go ahead and guess that one of his next points involves the amoral actions of one or more of said leads. to which i would respond, they're meant to be amoral. this is GTA, you play a criminal. you are playing as a villian. your actions are intended to be reprehensible. again, this is about proper story telling, not some kind of hidden sexist agenda on the part of rockstar. nor is it that they only view their playerbase as male, or that they would desire such a thing.\n\nreason 2 - the marketing includes provocative female imagery. this is a game with hookers and hook-ups. that is absolutely a character in the game, or at least it is a legitimate mechanical component of the game. are you saying games that appeal to audiences with this sort of content are inherently sexist? because the<b> re's not</b>hing wrong here. this doesn't discrimina<b> te by g</b>ender, only by orientation. i.e. lesbians may very well be interested in the same material. and even in regards to discrimination by orientaion, that's only the case because they're not supplying much beyond this one 'dish'. i'm not going to complain that i can't order icecream at a steakhouse.\n\nreason 3 - yes these are the women that the main characters surround themselves with, by concious choice or otherwise. any intel<b> ligent</b> woman would keep their distance from any one of our three douchecateers, hence, they're absent.\n\nreason 4 - yes, its a terribly shitty thing to do. i'd get into this, but i already predicted and rebuffed this point back at reason 1. \n\n@ 10:00 no i have not been convinced that the game is sexist, once again you make an assumption and just roll with it.\nif i saw somebody making such a claim, like here with you, i would feel like somebody is making a poorly founded argument and i'd seek to debate the issue. oh, here we are. some folks would respond worse, and some would respond similarly but with less smarmy-ness. however, i'd wager that few would agree. though i wont pass off that wager as a fact. see how this works?\n\n@ 10:40 and we have succeeded, it is legally recognized as such and the culture is slowly sing around to fully accept this as well. calling a game sexist solely because it's not kindergarten-level inclusive does not help. period.\n\nyes ebert got death threats, for many things, like most people do. give 12 year old's keyboards and an internet connection and that's what you get.\n\n11:50 saying you don't car<b> e about</b> sexism =/= endors<b> ement o</b>f sexism. i understand inaction is itself an action, but this is textbook false equivalency in order to commit ad hominem. I'm done, i can't watch this any further. I've seen this type of dismissive behavior far too frequently as of late and I'm simply disgusted by it at this point.",

The stereotypes for characters in games have barely changed over the years - and just because people hadn't complained before doesn't mean we can't or shouldn't now. And most of the feminists who argue that the females in these games should be altered don't mean omitted or watered-down, they just want them to be represented accurately and a little more PC. \nAnd not to mention the community itself. You can argue that it is not inclusive or supportive of the general concerns of the majority - and yes, nearly half of the community is represented by females.\nSo as a personal message from me to those who continually try to keep change out of the industry - grow up.

In the industry of gaming, much like any industry, feelings don't matter. The people that own these companies don't care who's feelings their hurting they only care about what makes money, and GTA V made a lot.

You won't get Rockstar to produce the games you want if you have a problem with their fictional world.

When characters do bad things in a movie, they suffer for it. At least, in main stream ones or is shown to be wrong. When it's supposed to be funny, or in a part of a joke or something of that nature, that too is ok for obvious reasons. \n\nWeirdly enough, here, too, it's ok because \"freedom of speech\". \n\nThe problem here is not that one is not boycotting it because that would be silly and counterproductive. What the problem is, on the other hand is that people are growing more and more insensitive to these bad things. There's no shame in calling a sexist thing sexist. That wouldn't automatically kill your GTA. it will only make it better and more inclusive for all people.",

It's almost as crap of an argument as to why Tomb Raider has a female lead... (yea, I know that Lara should be female) Why change something, if it is perfectly fine, and doesn't change much? This \"females should be represented more\" crap is the movement from like 2010-2012 (I dunno really) but do you get the idea that GTA V was almost finished when people started spewing this shit? I know I would have stayed with it, bc having a female doesn't mean just changing the character or the voice... It changes the whole story. Relationships, behaviors and so on. \nOh, and not to forget: YOU CAN PLAY FEMALE CHARACTERS in GTA ONLINE! Which is you know, the same game...\nThis seems just like gamergate yet again. You people try to invent things that are not even existing to say that they are bad.\n\nYou should be ashamed of yourself. \nSincerely, every fckin gamer who has some sort of a brain.\n\noh and PS: YOU ARE A FCKING MORON AND YOU ARE NOT ABOVE CRITICISM. YOU WILL NEVER BE, NOONE EVER WILL. \n\nPlease, just STFU\nthx",

My chemistry teacher plays Clash of Clans on her phone and TF2 at home many hours a week. It seems like you are prejudiced against certain kinds of games. When I was young and I had first moved out of my parents and in with some roommates we had a house computer with 16MB of RAM! It had Tetris and Doom on it and later in the decade we would network the computers and play Quake Arena. It only takes a few hours to complete Doom so we played Tetris competitively. I spent hours getting the high score and then slightly less than the high score in order to wipe my roommates names off the leader board. This went on almost daily for nearly a year. Beside Street Fighter II and Off Road at the local arcade this is the only game I played that year. So I guess by your standards I wasn't a gamer I was just someone who plays video games because I preferred a puzzle game for awhile. It's just anecdotal but it did seem that the women I knew then definitely preferred Tetris to Doom but when Quake Arena came out; probably because it was so novel at the time; women liked to play that. I could always find women friends to play Off Road at the arcade but fewer women played Street Fighter II. Whenever <b> Age </b>of Empires came out I knew a large contingent of women who loved and were real good at that game. I knew lots of women who liked Sim City. I play WoW with many women and it was fellow female employee who got me into that game back in the beginning of the 2000s. So 15% seems stupidly low.",

Though we aren't talking about anecdotal evidence we are talking about stastical data of which hardcore gaming is still very much a male driven activity. If the gaming industry thought there was money to be made by making games targeted at females they would happily do it. The only thing they care about is making money. They invest a lot of money into researching their target demographics to maximize profits and the research shows males are the ones plopping down their hard earned or parents hard earned money.

You could spend your entire life studying water or \"numbers and counting\" and still not fully understand them. Women are spending money on video games which is why some game developers respond to their critiques of female roles in games. I have no radical left agenda. I just don't mind if women have opinions about games and point out things they would like to see in games. The horror.\n\nHere is how we know you don't know how to read or reason very well. You don't know how to support your propositions with evidence. Even when repeatedly ask for sources that support your claims you won't produce a source that supports them. You say things like \"you can't force women into participating in gaming culture to fulfill your radical left agenda that thinks anytime their is a deparity between genders it must be due to some sinister cabal to oppress women.\" but who ever said that? Show me any sentence I wrote from any post ever that says I think you can force women to buy games or that there must be some sinister cabal to oppress women. When people don't know how to argue or reason they make stuff up like this because they are intellectually lazy or unskilled. It is much easier than listening carefully and responding to what someone actually said.\n\nHere is the thing you fail to understand about marketing. People who market to already existing markets are always competing for a share of the existing market as it's defined. When you research a market and ask people what they want out of a product they will tell you what they think they want. But there are many examples of research into products where people said they wanted things which were developed into a product and released with multi million dollar ad campaigns that failed to get the kind of sales they thought based on their research they would get. It turns out that people don't know what they want so you can't just ask them. Often the companies that get rich either create a whole new market or redefine an existing one thus creating a new space for their products where non existed before. Grey Poupon didn't get a share of the existing market for mustard dominated by French's and Gulden's they created a whole new category of mustard american consumers didn't even know they wanted thus having 100% of a new american market for dijon mustard (As illustrated by Malcolm Gladwell in his book Outliers).",

A gamer is a person who enjoys a game, who relaxes with a game while playing a puzzle game, tensing as they fight hords of zombies and enemies to protect the country from doom, someone who curiously explores space with friends or alone. Gamers, are not defined by what we have or dont have between ouer legs, or what ouer economic situation allows us to spend. Its the feelings we put into a game, the experiences we have while playing. And while I have spent ages in these intricate games I have alsoe spent about 8months ingame on Sylestia, a browser game. Playing Pokemon go, a MOBILE game, playing a browser game, playing only pc or only console games dont make you less of a gamer. We are all gamers if we enjoy a game.

GTA is a AAA Title that NEEDS the consumer to spend a lot of money to keep their company afloat. Consumers will shell out $60 for a new copy of a game that they want. How many women buy AAA titles on release day vs men? Dunno, they don't have surveys of this.\n\nThe issue with this video is the misapplication of data. The survey is for free games. He applies the consumer base for free games to AAA titles, and this doesn't work by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nHe qualifies a gamer as anyone who plays anything, pretty much. Fine. You wanna use that definition? Then I'll tell you why is logic is screwed up. GTA isn't meant for gamers as qualified here. GTA is meant for people who will spend $60 (or more for other editions).\n\nI welcome any and all who come into the gaming world, but to say that people who only play free games have a right to change how a AAA title is appealing to it's consumer base is a joke. That is why, as noble as his intentions may be, he missed the mark.\n\nExample: \"...even though Ubisoft executive Alain Corre acknowledges that 'couples' are playing games like Assassin's Creed, he also notes that 'it's still predominantly purchased by males\".\"\nhttp://www.gamezone.com/originals/looking-deeper-than-the-48-of-gamers-are-women-stat\n\nMore men than women buy video games.\nhttp://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ESA-Essential-Facts-2015.pdf\n\nAdditionally, though I can't find it, there was another report I wrote about some time ago that also addresses that men spend more time on average than women on video games... by nearly 2 hours a day.",

I will not say all people do that but they insult us, it is a lot less now but when it is spoken out people get aggressive. Using Paul's example in GTA 5, the way it depicts girls are sluts, and when you make an online character she looks 50+ or just plain out guy. Thus the 50/50 split never happens due to these games being unwelcoming. As i said earlier, sometimes it is not the game but the community the drives girls away, so they become scarce ( dunno if typed correctly ). Taking girl streamers how many became hits by just playing and not because of looks or showing some cleavage 1/10?",

I can't really see if they just did the survey in ONE area, or all over the country.\nPolygon themselves admit to their research being shallow, and it also includes cellphones as a gaming-device, which CAN be misleading. Just because you have a device capable of running games, doesn't mean that you actually play any, nor that you play often.\n\nIn any case, this whole gender-thing is a non-issue in the gaming-industry: There's a ton of women in the industry who sit on very prominent positions (Ubisoft have a good handful of top-leaders who are women, for starters), there's A LOT of games that cater to women specifically, because that's how the world works: You find your target-group, and you make something for them. Making a game for everyone will end up being a game for no one, because it has no focus, because people are different and want different things.\n\nI'm nearing 30, and I know for a fact that I don't want the same type of games that I wanted, when I was 18. Nor do my wife and I share the exact same taste in games, although we have similar tastes a lot of the time.\n\nHonestly, it baffles me that this is even a topic of discussion.

I'm currently on my second playthrough of Dragon Age: Inquisition, and there is NO armour in the game that shows off a ludicrous  amount of skin. In fact, most of it covers up the character completely. Even Vivienne, a character who's as flirtatious as she's dangerous, gets to switch out her dress pretty early on. Varric shows off more skin than any female character, not to mention The Iron Bull's no-shirt policy.\nHeck, even Resident Evil 7 has covered up their female characters, including the one you get to play as.\n\nWhat you're experiencing now is \"confirmation bias\". You believe something, ergo you take more note of evidence that support your claim, and automatically dismiss evidence that doesn't.\n\nAre there sexualized characters in some video games? Sure. Are they only female? No, not even close.",

They weren't the majority of gamers as a whole. They didn't just decide to flip to boys lol why wouldn't they choose the larger demographic? Also, the mere fact that shooting games exist doesn't prove <b> sexism.</b> Yes we can all agree that the COD franchise is just a cash grab at this point (a fact that many male gamers will agree with) but the fact that many of them target male gamers doesn't mean they're sexist. And if you don't buy that, just look at overwatch. About half the playable characters are female and don't have bouncing tits, and it's one of the most loved shooters of recent years. How much more could you possibly target the female demographic in a shooting game?",

It's not a matter of \"that's what makes the money\" when a company decides on the basic concept of the game. COD Infinite warfare and Overwatch are both shooting games, but one of them was made purely to milk a popular series while the other had some clear thought and heart put into it. No company is \"missing out\"",

                    "commentText": "\"just because they are not weak doesn't mean they are not \nsexualized and objectified the shit out of\" \nEven if that is true you'd still need to prove that there is something wrong with sexualizing and objectifying non real characters. \n\"GTAV has .... scenes where you HAVE to torture women.\" \nIt has scenes where you torture men too, that is equality. Isn't equality what you want? \n\"women online who dared to ask for some respect.\" \nThis issue has <b> nothing </b>to do with respect though. And respect is earned IMHO, you don't automatically deserve my respect just for existing. \n\n\"Video games were much more popular with women than men initially\" \nThat has<b>  nothing</b> to do with the current situation though. \n\"still doesn't negate the way women are handled in that franchise,\" \nNot sure what franchise you're talking about, but there's i<b> s nothin</b>g wrong with deciding to target the game to males who like fanservice and then including said fanservice, it certainly isn<b> 't misogy</b>ny. \n\"since the oppression of women doesn't affect you, you don't care, and don't acknowledge it's existence.\" \nGames that target fan service liking men are not oppression towards women. (In my opinion such claims are a bit offensive to people who face real oppression.) \n\n\"snobish nerd boys, who hate women deep down, keep shouting that they need the tits,...\" \nWhy would i want to see tits if i hate women? That sounds like twisted logic. That's like saying that i hate insects but still somehow want to see them in all the games, it makes no sense. \n\"because if those are taken away we are suddenly taking away their rights, their things, their freedom.\" \nWell the only way to stop games with fan service from happening is to ban them, and that is taking away our things and taking away the devs freedom to create art freely. \n\"it makes it seem like that's all that matters to them in a game.\" \nJust because someone likes to see fan service doesn't mean that they don't appreciate other things too. For example i did play undertale, and did like a lot of the things it did. \n\n\"yeah Overwatch being so popular...\" \nSexy characters are a big part of why overwatch is popular, just look at how much fan art people create. \n\"someone suggested \"maybe not sexualize women in video games so much?\"\" \nPeople are doing a lot more than suggesting these days. \n\n\"I believe men don't play video games to see sexy, poorly written, objectified female characters, so not having them won't alienate the male demographic, but instead draw in more women.\" \nThere's some huge generalizations here. Lots of gamers like to play games with fan service and if presented with two good games one with and one without fan service will choose the latter, therefore not having the fan service will alienate those gamers. And there not all men either, some girls like the anime tits and asses too. \n\"simply letting players cho<b> ose gen</b>der, is an easy step forward.\" \nDepending on the game that can be very expensive and time consuming to the devs. A triple-a game with story and voice acting would require at least a whole new voice track for the se<b> cond ge</b>nder, and probably some tweaks to the script and alternate recordings for the NPCs. \nBut if it's some game like a multiplayer FPS then i agree that devs should allow people to choos<b> e the g</b>ender.",

I'm arguing with Justin Hope, because he said \"gaming is the most egalitarian form of entertainment\"\n\nalso the difference between objectified men and women is, (I said this before):\n\u00a0usually sexy men, and by sexy I don't mean muscular, like for example batman, because that's not women's ideal man, but men's ideal man. that's what men think men should look like to be attractive.\nbut even when there are \"sexy\" men, they have way more complex character, better backstory and an actual purpose.\n\nAnd if you think sexualization is equal, what is the male version of Bayonetta? Dead or Alive? Lollipop Chainsaw? Or the girl in Metal Gear Solid prancing around in a bikini top in a warzone? Cause shirtless Geralt and Sephiroth can't even make up for a single one of them.",

Their intention is not to make a game in order to brainwash males into treating women like lower class. They're trying to ground the GTA series into realism according to what they see in the world of crime. The GTA games are pretty much a satire of American culture. The stories and characters are based off what people see in the world of crime. Whether it'd be gang violence, theft, murder...a lot of these kingpin druglords don't exactly treat women with respect. So why would the developers detach themselves from reality and make a character that kills/tortures people while at the same time having a moral compass solely for women? Audiences just won't let that sink in because it's not grounded in realism. The developers aren't adding<b>  sexism</b> because<b>  \"sexis</b>m sells,\" they're adding it because it's realistic to the character that is being portrayed. If the character is a violent gangbanging drugboss, why is it surprising that he also treats women like shit?\n\nFor the people complaining about this stuff, I have to say: Are you willing to ban Stephen King books because they have violence towards children? Are you willing to ban every crime noir novel because all the women are sexy whores? Are you willing to ban every war film becaus \"war is bad\" ? Are you willing <b> to du</b>mb down every quinten tarantino film because there's too much fictio<b> nal rac</b>ism?",

Sure, they game, but unless you are a <b> woman </b>who is competing at events, making content, and developing and creating mods, as being active in a community.

If you are not COMPETING IN TOURNAMENT, CREATING MODS, AND BEING ACTIVE IN STREAMS AND THE COMMUNITY, as a women, you are helping out the stereotype. Personally, I AGREE that women aren't a face of gaming, because there are EXTREMELY little tournament and community representation. If you are a women involved like this, RESPECT TO YOU, because YOU and ONLY you are helping out. But all of the other lazy girl gamers who aren't invloved are not changing anything. I personally think that women WHO COMPLAIN don't have credibility for sh*t. The real call is to female gamers to get INVOLVED, or<b>  nothing</b> will change. 47% of gamers are women, so 47% of gamers AREN'T playing real games by participating andmaking a difference.

            "commentText": "Not going to state my opinion on the matter here, but just based on some other comments and the video itself, you can't really blame gamers for not taking him seriously. He is incredibly disrespectful and disingenuous to those who disagree with him, and he spins the narrative in a so aggressively and hatefully that it seems more like a tirade than an argument. Those \"OMG\"s and troll faces in the counterargument section were just infantilizing his opponent's argument rather than greeting it with an air of credibility (Though for some arguments he presented by what I can in my experience say is a vocal minority, there isn't much that changes) Either way, very disrespectful and unprofessional. Acting like the target of your accusations feels very hypocritical.\n\nThe constant \"If you meet someone like this feel free to punch them\" just ruins his credibility. He sounds like he's speaking out of personal vendetta, like he has some bone to pick.\n\nGTA is also more or less a criminal simulator. You perform very unsavory and violent acts for personal profit. Of course the player profits from the shaming, if they didn't they would have no incentive to do the mission. Not saying it's okay to do stuff like that, but you play as a criminal. <b> Sexism </b>is evident in games like this, and there are terrible people out there who propogate hate and discrimination by<b>  race</b> an<b> d se</b>x, but this may in fact be due to larger social issues. \n\nYou see it all the time, people seeking to gain or maintain power look to the ever evolving forms of media as a scapegoat for larger societal norms. The war against rock, MTG card art censorship, comic book scares, D&D causing satan worship, gaming causing violence, and today, gaming a<b> nd sexi</b>sm. \n\nLastly, he speaks too generally about not only gamers as a people, but what constitutes as gaming. About the 47%, there is a difference. For some, gaming counts as just playing a video game like candy crush. For others, it involves highly competitive games like LOL, DOTA, Overwatch, and CS:GO. In these spaces, the ratio of men to women is much lower. Not to say gamers don't like girl gamers, but in these games, it boils down to one factor: Are you any Good?\n\nSince many 'girl gamers' (a term I feel just makes matters<b>  of sex</b>ism worse) tend to play less competitive games and not take it seriously, players' past experience has created a stereotype of a bad player. People like Jaynee, Blarue, and Masaeanela don't get flak because they are good or laidback. The stereotype of the bad girl gamer is something that I feel is a real problem, but the way in which different demographics play their games matters a lot. Gaming isn't a predictable art form as some might lead you to believe, every game is unique and attracts different fans. GTA's popularity is largely contributed to it's massive media presence in the violence in video games debate. It may have gotten a bad rap, but it sold a ton of copies as a result and still remains in the public eye.\n\nThat and his solution of more games like Nintendo games and mobile games diminishes the idea of games as art. Dark themes and challenging moral ideas are things games can dwell into. I doubt he would call Life is Strange anything other that art, as it is quite a good game, and other games teach different morals. GTA as a game is one whose history of success in the past has banked and made bank on controversy, MTG has one of the most diverse casts of characters is fictional media along with Overwatch. \n\nOverall, this could have been better. Some of his points were on such as those who will never adapt to changes in gaming, but as a person who plays games, this didn't really speak to me as much as it sounded like it spoke against me. I understand many in the audience likely didn't play games, know your audience, but it isn't right to oversimplify and villainize people\u00a0like this. Without presenting clear evidence of the effect games hav<b> e on se</b>xism, this could be boiled down to people on the internet abusing their anonymity via the penny arcade \"Respectable man + Audience + Anonymity = Unrespectable man\" equation. Games are connected to the internet, and often, that formula qualifies in all forms of anonymity. You could play hearthstone for years and never hear a sexist remark unless you went out into open internet country, where you would be met with all forms of trolls and sexist, but hearthstone isn't to blame, people who wish to be mean will find their ways and their places. Gaming is just another place for it to happen, and we can try, but they won't leave. And to be completely honest, we have no right to tell them to get lost. Under the narrative of gaming being an inclusive space, we can't just selectively kick out ides we don't agree with. These people have no right to do it, we shouldn't ei<b> ther. S</b>exism in games will always be a problem as long as people bring personal biases into games. Most gamers just want to play games, we should simply not encourage exclusive behavior, and just play games. I don't know the full scope, but frankly, I just want to play my games and have fun doing so. I don't want censorship to appeal to any political group, that just makes games feel less real. \n\nEdit: And the boy's club analogy is also very bad. If the air smelled fresh they wouldn't be complaining and scowling The people who dislike women in games are a problem, but it is unfair to imply that all serious gamers are like that. There is certainly a grouch corner, but these people aren't representative of gaming culture, to focus on them isn't productive. There are those who need to grow up, but there are always those who will never change their ways. Don't make the shrew into a snake. \n\nAny feedback is very much appreciated (This is a bit too long)",

But even chess, when it was invented, was played mainly by Kings and nobility who aimed to sharpen their military acumen and hone their skills in battle. In other words, these were men who played. \n\nToday, there a story woven into every game and every story deserves an interpretation. I wonder if Kings and nobility of the past considered if every chess piece had a story too? Will they be able to\u00a0move the pawn knowing it has a wife and two kids? \n\nI'm a <b> woman,</b> and I play Skyrim but not GTA-V. I found GTA-V very violent and distasteful, not only because of the way it portrays women, but also the way it portrays men! But seriously, aren't we taking this a little too seriously?\n\nIf women truly cared enough, and they truly represented 47% of the gaming community, I am pretty sure that change\u00a0is around the corner. But too often are the masses led by a vocal few to a point\u00a0where everybody starts taking up a view that is not even theirs. \n\nRemember: there are many types of games women can play and not all of them are competitive, hypermasculine, and misogynistic. Women need to pick their battles. Today, majority of nurses are still women but men didn't come barging in saying that the nursing industry is 'sexist'. Men just make different choices. \n\nAs for female gamers who feel alienated and discriminated against...? You decide what is more important to you: the game itself? or the story behind it? If you're looking for a good game, you'll have to put up with the crappy story. Otherwise, stick to chess. But if you're looking for a good story, watch a movie.",

All the hate and vitriol, the men ganging up against us, and the women doing the same, sadly in order to be accepted among those same males; could be viewed as an excellent reason for starting a big discussion instead of abandoning it. But we know that's not the usually the case.Why? Because of misogynistic repression, in the name of freedom, that's why. We don't choose our battles wisely, sadly we usually choose only those in which we can expect our peers support unless forced to do otherwise. And to many females whose social life is mainly online gaming, picking up certain battles at the cost of having to constantly argue and prove yourself would take too much of an emotional toll. \n\nFeminism takes a really big emotional toll on everyone. Which brings me to the other half of the equation: the men that think they believe in and defend equality, while being specially violent and hateful towards women for no real  reason. All that anger has to come from somewhere, and has to have some effects on them. I don't claim to know the origins of their anger, but I know two things about angry men: they're vocal, and they have always been so about women, till the point they even dictate what womanhood is every society and every  religion. Educated, egalitarian men hardly feel like mingling with the angry mob. Yes, they may be disgusted by this type of behavior, but  they rarely feel the need to speak up to their peers.Thus, I wouldn't rely on them as more than collaborators. And relying on other to fight our battles is counterproductive to the bigger battle imho: really start seeing ourselves as equally human, and maybe help others do so too.",

Being called a girl is still an insult today.\n\nI always try to choose in a manner which will inspire others to do the same, maybe let them know they are not alone in this and they can stand up for what they believe in. Many times we should, even if we are beaten down.\n\nAs for feminism, I don't live in the US, therefore I cannot speak to the situation there. I know where I live there is endemic <b> sexism </b>throughout society and it does come at a cost. I have left a very lucrative career because of it and I know others that have done the same.\n\nYou are right about men, however I think the cause is social. Men are not taught to cooperate, they are taught to dominate. Everything is a game and effort is all that is required to win. Ergo, when a<b>  woman</b> says no, they are losing and therefore more effort is required.\nIf the answer continues to be \"no\", then someone is directly taking an action against them and therefore are to blame for the loss. The other person is often seen to be doing the wrong thing to them, personally.\n\nThis needs to be changed at a very youn<b> g ag</b>e, in the meantime I think everyone who is aware of the issues, needs to speak up. I have seen a piece of crap male being nasty to a female, his friends exchange a glance, but don't speak up. They know the creep will take it badly. That needs to change. They need to know their behaviour is not acceptable and the victim of their actions won't be listened to, she's the \"prize\".\n\nThe guys that I have met that are aware of the issues don't speak up. As you said, they do need to \"see the need\". If they can't do it for the sake of it being the right thing to do, then they should realise that one day, it will be their daughter facing the same thing.\n\nThank you for replying, I enjoyed your comments. :)",

I'm just gonna ignore him, but this reminds me reminded of Sallinger's passage \"That's the whole trouble. You can't ever find a place that's nice and peaceful, because there isn't any. You may think there is, but once you get there, when you're not looking, somebody'll sneak up and write \"Fuck you\" right under your nose \"\n\nI also can't speak about the particularities of feminism in de USA from direct experience. But comparing it with the European feminism I have to agree with Amelia Valc\u00e1rcel when she says protestant countries tend to have a form of <b> patriarchy </b>based on respect for the man (because he protects you ....from other men) rather than fear. In countries like mine<b>  patriarchy</b> is based more on fear and violence than in the \"homo sacerdos\", the respect paradox or media influence; so everyda<b> y sexis</b>m may be easier to spot. But the situation in the entertainment industry is globalized enough that we can obser<b> ve sexi</b>sm there from almost anywhere in the world I think.\n\nTherefore, I can understand how the Boston woman's colleges movement, the \"free love\" philosophy, <b> the sex</b>ual liberation and the values of the third wave took root and exploded in pop culture in the USA. That definitely helped Europe's deconstructing some taboos about women's sexuality, homosexuality and such; but it's not all <b> rosy col</b>ored. It also came tangled with postmodernism, psychoanalysis, sadist thought and neo-liberalism in the perfect storm that gave birth to this \"freedom and equality\" system in which women are free \"to polish their own chains\", as Mary Wollstonecraft would put it. There's lots of confusion generate among young women when think tanks and pr machines identify fem<b> inist s</b>exual liberation with \"willing submissive objectification\". Add to that some men devising new ways to own and use women like in the<b>  \"go</b>od old days\" and a horde of confused young boys, who seem to feel terribly oppressed by the fact that they are not able to get <b> all </b>the sex they want, looking up to them. \n\nThat's the explanation I find most plausible for \"the more free I see you, the more submissive I want you\" subtenant motto that runs all these fantastical 3rd and 4th order simulacra, these symbols of women that have taken root in pop culture, social media, video games and entertainment in general. As a feminist, as a gamer, but mainly as a developer I have to agree that it all comes down to education. Constant education on how to re-educate oneself, how to evaluate and contrast all information, including the visual kind and the implicit kind, in order to extract patterns. The thing is, today we receive information mainly through straight up manipulated images designed to imprint on us as attention traps, images that construct a sort of parallel stereotypical reality that makes this \"doublethinking\" , this willful blindness possible. Most media serve mainly to sell available human brain time to advertisers and marketers. Don't remember who said this, but is still worth quoting: \"education can try as hard as it wishes to fill their brains, we will empty them afterwards\" .\n\nThat's more or less what's happening imho, is not like these young boys lack education, family values or resources in most cases. Is more like all that is constantly being pushed into a corner of their brains to make room for all the massive amount of contradictory information they garter on a daily basis. Is not like parents don't care, is more like can't even begin to understand the world they live in and how to reach them. But marketers know a way to channel and exploit those frustrations: get them h<b> ooke</b>d on sex and violence, give them a sense of entitlement and call it \"art\" and \"freedom\". Then give them a target, and the wheels of patriarcal neo-liberalism will do the rest.",

Like comics or sports, videogames have also been covered, oriented, presented and marketed as as \"guys stuff\" for the most part; which makes it difficult for girls to integrate and in turn creates this sterotype of hardcore gamers as male in our minds. When we are made to recognize there's also women in there, we lack the necessary media and culture reinforcement to picture them in the same situation. So another sterotype comes in handy, the one that says all gamer women go absolutely insane for colorful and cute mobile games, and shun violent or competitive games.  Hand in hand with tha<b> t ol</b>d stereotype that said girls didn't like fantasy unless it involved lots of princesses, and ponies, and pink stuff. \n\nBut even if that was true, what makes you say mobile market is not representative, when it's public is much broader?

Especially when the industry as a whole is naturally segregated purely by interest. The most respected surveyors, Pew Research, also claim 50% of all \"gamers\" are female. What this does not address, is what constitutes a \"gamer\". For starters, the idea that a gamer is simply someone who actively plays video games is a hollow definition and completely meaningless in public. If you were to analyze shooter games, you would find 80% are male, 80% for action, and 85% for sports. Even in games like WoW only 35% are females. So where are all of these women that supposedly encompass the overwhelming majority? In other areas of interest! Particularly showing an interest in puzzle, rpgs, and casual games. The only reason people get up in arms about lack of representation is becaus<b> e gende</b>r is taboo and it is politically correct to defend minorities. But as you should know, being politically correct doesn't mean it's the correct thing to do.\n\nTake Lego for instance. For years people wanted girl Lego toys. And Lego delivered. Yet everyone was outraged when they found out it was an intricately designed pink building restaurant about baking and cooking. What went wrong? For starters, if you wanted the Lego CITY set and you were a girl, then you should have just bought it. They don't even use male pronouns in their advertisements. Secondly, did Lego, a multi-million dollar company, just decide pink because it would best reflect the years of female oppression? Of course not. They do a ton of marketing research, looking for the best way to sell their product to a now specifically catered audience, women. It would not only be financial suicide to release their product without analyzing stereotypes, but would undermine everything advertisement stands for. Which is my last point. Marketing has always existed to push people's buttons. The so called \"pink tax\" myth on pink calculators is a great example. It's not because Texas Instruments is sexist, but rather as you don't believe women do go absolutely insane for colorful and cute. Pink calculators didn't exist at first. But the demand from women made thousands of company realize that women are willing to spend a little more for a change in color. Cue in capitalism and the rest is history. But you aren't alone, men are also exploited.\n\nSo tying this to video games, if you want more games that cater to your specific wants, either group up with similar people and make that game, or show companies your wallets, or you are S.O.L. But whatever you do, don't waltz into any market and whine that you are not being catered to. Getting catered to is not a human right.",

On the other hand all companies must do whatever they can to cater to their clients, and of course a company like Lego has to do whatever it can to reach broader markets and demographics before releasing any product. Yet, targeting a female audience that's already there, and making products that are more friendly towards them so that audience may grow exponentially (and with it, benefits), is somehow wrong?\n\nI've think you've hit the capitalist marketing loop with the Lego thing without noticing. See, that's the problem with designing cultural content based on market research. Market research shows what some people liked in the recent past, and just that. Market research, Bernays type propaganda (oops, \"public relations\", sorry), cannot provide new cultural solutions to new cultural and social challenges. You may follow market research and make a profit with a cultural product; but arts and culture should be works that extract patterns from the present in order to imagine new futures. I don't see that happening at all in the mainstream videogame market; which is in turn influencing the mainstream film industry, and so on.  If you ask me, this was all well in the 90's and early millennium, but at this point most rehashed shit is starting to smell. For all the visual advances, narrative has barely improved at all. \n\nWhich brings me to the \"special <b> snowflake\"</b> bit. Honestly I've never understood why so much sarcasm in the expression, obviously I have my circumstances, but I'm just one of many. I may be making my own games, like many other indie developers, other women are still fighting to get into the mainstream industry, and also many of them got tired of all the sexist bullshit in mainstream video games and gravitated towards the mobile game industry, films, TV and animation; simply because they were given better opportunities in a much less toxic environment. And many of them that don't grew up with video games may have been curious, but went for mobile games to play on the go instead. Can you blame them? You can't exclude them, patronize them, shoo them away; and then pretend they are \"just not into it\". They are into it, despite games not being designed with them in mind . I don't have the impression that the mainstream game community wants more female gamers, I'm under the impression that they want more \"men with teats\" that enjoy shooting heads up and beating up whores playing as thugs. So, by protecting your idea of what a video game is, you are actively preventing us from exploring what video games could become as we all need to survive in a market based economy. Don't know why, is not like the games you loved are gonna be erased from the face of the earth, but there you go, so much for artistic freedom when confronted with cultural conditioning...",

Payday2 for example may not be exactly my idea of what non-casual games could grow up to; but I don't see how introducing non-hypersexualized female characters as requested has made the game less manly; nor have I seen hordes of furious male players abandoning the game. I personally don't believe that well constructed narratives with three dimensional female characters, Game of Thrones style, would feel \"like a tampon\" for guys, but okay... \n\nI also don't think a market tyranny on culture is something to  wish for. For starters because it's the artist's job to steep into the unknown and challenge people's perceptions in order to bring back from chaos something that has never been seen before. I think artistic freedom is more important than consumer demands, because if there's no room for games born out of a conscious necessity to express and communicate, games wont ever hold cultural value and become art in their own right. \n\nThis is not a new issue; art vs craft, tradition vs change, fantasy and fiction vs reality and social background. This was strongly trending back in the beginnings of the third wave of feminism, back when Ende wrote the Neverending Story; even before with Dr. Wertham and comics code, cinema and Hays code, and virtually in every iconoclast dispute. All of these debates in Occident tend to end with the \"even tho the use of certain iconography and symbolism may be problematic from a social point of view, government regulation is undesirable as it will inevitably restrict individual freedom and artistic expression\". But somehow, you seem  convinced that marketing and cultural prejudice restricting the individual freedom and choices of half of the world's population is the epitomy of freedom. Hardly your fault, those pr machines really are good at their jobs, but nevertheless we still should be able to recognize the reason why artistic freedom is important. Hint: is not just because it may allow you to escape reality, and fulfill your little nihilistic fantasies in order to reinforce the idea of manhood you have previously been conditioned into buying.   \n\n We could get started on markets. Calling them \"free\" is laughable. Markets are not just governed by supply and demand laws, they are also fueled by a series of personal and political interests; by ideology and culture, and entwined with politics and history in every single case. Where governments are not regulating the markets, marketers do so in order to maximize their profits. Say what you want about political interventionism, but at least public powers in most occidental countries are subjected to scrutiny, validated in elections and charged with the task of preserving their citizens rights ans serve their interests. This doesn't happen with the economic, mediatic, religious or cultural powers that have made a mockery of politics, and can't be called democratic by any stretch of the imagination. \n\nSpecially mass communication, services and entertainment industries that don't deal in physical goodies, are determined by cultural and ideological factors.  Consumer's \"free choice\" is not such, as the sub product of this imagery-based marketing culture is that the mass passively absorbs whatever is marketed to them as long as you pull the right psychological, cultural and ideological buttons. Then, the carefully researched and engineered acceptance of the message can be used as justification and proof for the \"democratic\" validity of the message itself, because the public accepts it without much defense or awareness (see above, or Bernay's \"propaganda\"). Even subversive or reactionary movements can be integrated in the loop; polished and marketed as \"edgy\" by middle-aged middle-brow profiteers looking to suck the life energy (not to mention artistic talent and spending money) out of the \"youth culture\". So yeah, it's not impossible to do your own independent and revolutionary thing; but it's pretty fucking difficult. And no matter how hard you try, you certainly wont achieve the visual immersion AAA games can deliver by sticking to well established design languages in their worlds, investing millions of dollars in building them. But to be fair, is not that no one in AAA studios wants to make different stuff, is simply that they hardly can take turns when the technical standards in the field have rocketed so much and the audience is so defensive towards changes. Is not easy to speak transcendence or awareness, when your audience only knows and understands the reactionary appearance of transgression.  \n\nThen again, if it was easy it wouldn't be so interesting.",

For starters, our genders influence greatly what you and I do differently and companies are simply exploiting that. But to say that it is wrong for genders to influence our interests and hobbies is leftist bullshit and a bad excuse to dilute natural interests. Not to say that men or women are genetically entitled to \"owning\" certain hobbies but they will be more naturally inclined to lean towards certain areas and naturally hold a majority voice. To actively seek and \"balance out\" these stereotypes in the name of the o<b> ther ge</b>nder would be like petitioning to sell veggie burgers in In-N-Out in the name of vegetarians. And if you really want to conflate it on a broader scope, you can apply the same thing with the lack of women in STEM jobs. I don't believe more women should be in STEM jobs because everything should be 50-50, that would be self-serving political intent. Rather, I believe they should be in STEM jobs if they wish to.

I'm not saying companies that sell artistic products have a hidden political agenda, I'm saying they are not free from being influenced by politics, ideology, fads and reactions; spreading them in turn. Artists are fucking sponges for that shit, and nowadays we usually train our craft in tightly closed pop-culture bubbles in order to become highly specialized, competitive professionals. So we usually create and spread more pop culture imaginary and ideology in turn. Society influences art, which influences society in turn, and so on.\n\nMarkets are complex ecosystems where a butterfly may stir hurricanes, so to speak. When I say governed by personal interest, I'm referring for example to the artificial manipulation of Euribor index the EU commission just found the leaders of some financial entities guilty of. That single action rocked the real state and financial markets in the EU; influenced politics in the south; affected many people's lives etc. Markets, culture, education and politics are interconnected by this current of neo liberalism that states the globalized world and all that it contains is a big marketplace where everything may be bought and sold; in a \"if God doesn't exist, everything is permitted\" fashion.  So you are made to think you are the all-mighty client, and \"producers\" or \"creatives\" are there to serve you; when in truth most of us are just here to be milked and exploited as consumers, workers or entrepreneurs by capital interests like the above. This ideology may look as \"<b> common </b>sense\" today; but comes as consequence of the political tactics implemented in the Reagan-Thatcher period: deregulation of financial sectors, privatization of public services tightly related with citizens fundamental rights, debilitation of trade unions, marketing and repackaging of civil rights movements (like feminism) or subversive cultural movements (like punk)  by the giants in fashion and entertaiment industries, etc. But it didn't even began with Thatcher and Reagan; this was just a continuation on the post-war repressive policies that were aimed to make women return back to their homes, and stay there as the CEOs of the family (Betty Friedan), plus the policies implemented in order to prevent \"leftist\" thought from spreading; thus protecting the Lockean conception of freedom vs the \"commies\".\nPropaganda campaigns were and are being orchestrated in order to manipulate public opinion, and most authors start as public themselves; that's why I refereed you to Bernays's work: it was the base for all we know as marketing and propaganda; from Goebbels's to sponsored content. He developed his work based on that of his uncle's, Sigmund Freud; which in turn was the father of the study of sexuality in relation to genre and clinical psychology; and whose theories we should have been able to surpass long ago thanks to experimental psychology and neuroscience; but paragraphs like yours demonstrate we have not. Hardly your fault, again, this has been chiseled into popular culture long ago by many artistic movements and postmodern authors.\n\nThese \"natural inclinations\" you talk about aren't so; they are just the convenient explanation some men had for this structural oppression of women They weren't even called \"natural\" until baroque philosophy, before these \"natural inclinations\" were \"God's plan for women\" (again, dictated by male religious authorities; by men and not God) . Freud sympathized with Arthur Schopenhauer's though; which came to say Nature was just a cycle of<b>  sex</b> and death, and Nature's plan for men was to make them rational and intelligent in order to achieve knowledge; but nature's plan for women was to make them attractive in order to get what they wanted from men: marriage and financial security (note how for Schopenhauer Nature's plan for women involves religion and economy?). Which again, entwines with the widely accepted conception at the time that women were governed by their uterus (hysteros in greek, that's were \"hysterical\" comes from) and men by their brains. And the christian notion of genesis and original sin, plus the protestan notion that each man is a representative of God, but most women are just succubus-like incarnations of the devil; that men have desires, while women ARE desire. This all have been reactionary ideas that seeked to maintain male domination in times of political and social changes leading to the recognition of more individual freedoms. Darwin himself said the proof that men were more intelligent than women could be extracted from the fact that few women had made contributions to occidental science; overlooking the fact that women who weren't allowed to study science, could hardly contribute to it. Same with games. I never had a game console growing up; in fact I saved for a year to buy a gameboy pocket and my parents took it away from me because \"videogames aren't for girls\". Like me, hundreds and thousands of little girls weren't even given the chance to try videogames back in the day, they were given barbies and dressed up as princesses instead. And now you do another \"Darwin\" and attribute to \"natural inclination\" what only comes as consequence of discriminatory treatment....\n\nWhich brings me the the quota thing. Look here, 50% quotas are a parity measure; not \"positive discrimination\". We are half of humanity, in case you didn't noticed. Positive discrimination is when someone gives you something you do not have because you have some handicap. You cannot consider half of humanity handicaped, no matter how opressed they are by the other half, because \"humanity\" as concept cannot be male or female<b> , blac</b>k or white, left or right; but both and none. Go figure. \n\nSo, if I w<b> as disabl</b>ed, and I wanted to get into a public administration job, I would get in with lower qualifications because 10% of the spots are reserved for people with disabilities; and that's positive discrimination. But in the case of women we find out that, with the same tiles and qualifications as men; they still get kicked out of elites and not admitted into certain fields. On the other hand they are systemically being swayed and pushed towards retrograde decorative <b> and sex</b>ual roles in blooming new industries, while still being generally regarded as caretakers and male helpers. In my country, women make up to 60% of university students. They graduate in less years and generally with better qualifications than their male counterparts. But in contrast to what one might expect, the presence of women in the grand staff is around 2% in the public financial powers, 4% in the case of public media, close to 5% in public academies and institutions of knowledge; insignificant in creativity and genius support from public institutions; and simply 0 in religious power elites. In politics, which may be the most transparent of those powers, even tho all parties must meet parity quotas, women are systemically being relegated to secondary places; questioned and mocked for no other reason than being women by the press and the public. On the gaming field? refer to this comment section or the video above for a taste of what we have to endure. \n\nNatural inclination<b>  has not</b>hing to do with this, this is the<b>  goo</b>d old discrimination we know so well; thank you very much. This is asking women to prove themselves much harder in order to obtain much less. This \"meritocracy\" is bullshit. If we are politically equal, with the same rights and citizenship as men; yet that doesn't translate in an proportional distribution of spaces and power; it's obvious that this system is biased somewhere. This is not what equal rights and opportunities stands for, this is a quimera in which desires are marketed as rights and freedoms even against the democratic values and ideas we have to thank for our fundamental rights and freedoms. This is a mirage in which the ample majority of society believes the genres are politically equal as fact that doesn't need to be proven anymore<b> . That </b>sexism existed in the past because people didn't knew any better; but now (without knowing exactly how) society has been liberated f<b> rom </b>all old prejudices and accepted women as equal. And the result is the distribution of spaces, roles and powers we have today. 2%, 4%, 5%, 0% for more than 50% of the population. That's what you call \"justice\", \"freedom\" and \"equality\"?.",

The legislators, ethicists and political scientists that created those laws understood that, for institutions and public powers to be representative of the will of the people, the people in the institutions should be representative of the people in the country, go figure. The idea being that is impossible for democratic institutions to represent  the female population if the female population itself isn't present at the institutions; and also the idea that it is their right as citizens to have the same access to whatever is PUBLIC. Because we are better prepared and going to do better than men? No, because we are half of society, PUBLIC institutions belong to society and so It is our right to be given the chance to do just as good or as bad as the men in them.  \n\nCall that \"social engineering\" if you want; but imho that term applies better to the educational and cultural processes by which women and men are raised to accept <b> sexism </b>as \"the way things are\"; and later end up calling this interiorized conditioning \"free choice\", \"consent\" or \"equality\". Are there worse forms of \"social engineering\" out there than literal mind programing from birth based on our<b>  sex</b>? Is there any bigger attack on individual freedom than that which is inflicted upon the minds of the citizens without their knowledge and consent?\n\nYou talk big about taking responsibility; but the thing is responsibility is undividable from power and freedom; because without power there's no freedom; and without freedom there's no such thing as \"choice<b> \".Se</b>x in not a choice; yet is going to determine the power and freedom you can hope for. It's funny how women are prevented from reaching power, how society restricts their freedom; and still they are held responsible f<b> or sexi</b>sm and blamed for the violence they suffer. Curious how many victims are blamed or end up blaming themselves; while the perpetrators boast about their deeds and power instead of \"taking responsibility\". When is gonna be enough, I ask you? When are you going to consider us human enough to start taking the violence and discrimination we suffer seriously?",

Some people are simply more talented or attractive than others and will always find life easy regardless of <b> race </b>or<b>  gender</b>. Some people can't cope and end up sitting in the street(mostly middle aged white men strangely). We all have innate bias and I would like you to consider how who you would consider a victim might not correlate to who is actually feeling social consequences for these predispositioned biases which we all suffer from as human beings. I feel no ill will toward you but I find your certainty unsettling as I would not want to speak for others as for their intentions or the amount of liberty an individual has. The advocacy for women specifically in the west is now a multi billion dollar industry with lobbying power. This has secured funding for increased health and welfare spending as well as jobs for a newly created legal industry. In the meantime no infrastructure exists to lobby for male heath, male welfare (homelessness?). Male life expectancy keeps widening wit<b> h woma</b>n and educational performance keeps falling. And as a male I am not supposed to care about this. Feminism is the establishment now. More men than you could know are aware of this situation as l see it. God bless you",

Women come off worse no doubt accounted by physical size difference. As a recipient of violence from my mother and not from my father growing up I can account for the statically reality that the overwhelming majority of violence towards children comes from mothers to sons. So violence is a complicated and entirely statistically non gendered issue. Yet <b> woman </b>get overwhelming legal protections from men and this exists in every western country. So the concern for me is the recognition of female violence which men rarely report because the system already steps on men hard who transgress. But statistics and now famous social experiments still demonstrate a difficulty in even taking female violence seriously. But one should not exaggerate the issue because historically general levels of violence in society is at a low and that should be celebrated.",

You don't shame her at all. It's meant to be funny. The majority of the millions of girl gamers would have found it funny too. \n\nSaying that you shame her in the game is a lie. It is just simply a lie. Everyone reading this who played the mission in the game knows that you have just lied to try make your argument more compelling. \n\nYES it doesn't sound funny in a comment but if you played it and fully understood the situation you would probably find it funny. \n\n13:06 no you watch them tell you that you are right but the reverse is also true. A male character with all those things is just as good. The reality is the game has male leads and although it could be good with female leads too, it doesn't. But it does have GOOD male leads so what is the problem? \n\n13:23 It would be better if it had female leads? That sounds pretty sexist to me. A game can be just as good with male leads.\n\n13:43 If every game depicted women as they do in GTA V then I would be behind you in thinking there is a problem but the reality is that no one is going to play just one game. Plus you are talking about children having role models yet GTA V is an adult game. So basically you are saying that the depiction of women in the game is problematic because of the impression it could give to kids. it isn't even a game for kids. it's a game for adults.\n\n14:11 so when a <b> woman </b>manipulates a man you don't find that sexist? Yet you find it sexist that a random<b>  woman</b>'s body was used in the marketing of GTA V. \n\n15:24 Girls get treated like Goddesses when guys meat them in video games actually. People who want to pick on a girl aren't doing it because they are a girl, they pick on everyone but if the victim happens to be female they will use insults based o<b> n gende</b>r just to annoy her.  Feel free to dismiss this as bull since I can't remember the source of the study but a study found that people assumed to be girls because they used female avatars get treated nicer in online games.",

If we're arguing in a heated way and we start to throw insults that are unrelated to the topic in question, of course that would be rude and even low. But, here's the thing: in the context of this video, my serious opinion is that he really is weak. Anyone who cries discrimination over <b> dumb </b>and even sometimes normal interactions between humans, is someone who hasn't mature completely, or has past traumas and now thinks that the world and every little thing about it it's a huge menace against them. In both cases they have some growing up to do. In the case of male feminists, it can be even worse, because that tells me that this person has never been deep into relationships with women, because of their lack of ability to distinguish when a women is complaining about<b>  nothing</b>, and manipulating (which women tend to do often).\n\nSo, even if it seems rude, to me he really is a mangina. Sorry, but that's my real and serious opinion.\n\n\nIn your second point - of course, if we're talking about a debate, your right. But a youtube comment is not by any means a serious debate... at least not for the most part.",

That is, of course, the price people pay for the freedom of speech. Also, as other people have mentioned, Grand Theft Auto is a bad example because it's the character who are sexist, not the developers.

You want to change the <b> gender </b>of a character just because. Her<b>  gender</b> wont even affect anything as you said. It's arbitrary. This is destructive. And actually it would affect a lot of things. For starters, different genders have different effects on stories. A lot of writers take advantage of this to deliver strong points of emotion.\n\nNo, Bechdell is not important. You can say straight porn fails Bechdell test therefore straight porn is sexist. It isn't affected by context which is the problem with it. Also I don't know why you are still in an abusive relationship with your boyfriend. Your friend is right though. Most women in GTA, that particular game, are there to be fucked. That's a literal fact. He was not talking about women in real life which somehow is how you understood as. The game didn't turn your sweet friends into misogynists. What are the citizens in GTA there for? To be killed. I am now a mass murderer psychopath. Same thing.\n\n\"well, so you're saying you wouldn't play a game where there's powerful females in it?\"\nDepends. I like Tomb Raider more than Uncharted because it does the \"lone explorer\" trope better. Lara felt more cunning and agile BECAUSE she was a female character. Drake was more of a smug strong kind of person because he was a young man.",

If that is the case I would suggest you calm your worries by doing some research on the issue.",

                    "commentText": "I get you are saying that \"she should allow discussion because it's valuable, despite the assholes\". And I'm with you that it is a disgrace when discussion is banned, but one must understand the reason of the banning if one aspires to lift these bans eventually.\n\n Discussion is valuable because it is powerful, and in that targeted channel the discussion is dominated entirely by some who are using it's power to cater to the lowest instincts and irrational fears of the audience. I'm afraid you are not taking into account the ramifications and consequences of the actions of those assholes. Because, even if those assholes are traumatized and unsupervised kids drunk with power living in their internet microcosmos (Obnoxious rings a bell?) their actions and speech have real- life consequences.  Internet imitates society imitates internet, and so on.Those assholes have an audience, like every bully who ever lived; and the most dedicated members of the audience aspire to get the same likes, attention or recognition as the bullies on top by some radical action. And so the cicle continues, and new bullies are recruited into the cult, using MRA, journalism integrity or whatever as bait.  Most of them are not fucked- up double faced individuals to begin with; they start going down that road when they start thinking their ideals justifies the means.  Along comes fear and paranoia; and the feminazis become the new <b> Communist,</b> Illuminati, Freemason or whatever in their minds. Then all feminist are a feminazis. Then all women.\n\nThese bullies deeply believe they are the victims, the punishers or the Saviors; and the only ones able to see through the female conspiracy tale that lured them in. Add to the mix the sexist conceptions we all grew up with, a butt-hurt ex-boyfriend as spiritual leader, some teens that pride themselves \"real gamers\" meaning \"lack a real life social interaction experience\", some major companies bowing down to those teens, and a few media eager to generate views and profit on the controversy; then you can see how this internet cult spreads like wildfire when not contained.\n\nThat's why some feminist videos choose not to allow comments, in order to not further fuel those fires. And is not just Sharkeshian. Search \"imagine a world where being<b>  ga<b> y</b</b>> was the norm\" and then \"oppressed majority\" on youtube. Two short films that are practically identical in form, using the same visual and story telling resources to challenge views on sexuality a<b> nd gend</b>er roles. Yet on the homosexuality video you have thoughtful discussion and tons of support comments. <b> The gen</b>der video? No comments allowed. Honestly, it pains me to see how people are unwilling to rethink and discuss their stance<b> s on ge</b>nder,  specially because they show they can do it when it com<b> es to</b> r<b> ace or </b>sexual orientation. But I'm not gonna blame it on the ones taking all the heat, and still trying to speak up and challenge people's perceptions. \n  \n When Anita has tried to go to video game events to discuss these issues live with the audience, the assholes responded with bomb threats if she attended (because freedom of speech, you know), and the organization gave in and dropped her panel not wanting to compromise security.  Those assholes are forcing her and her family to leave their homes with constant death threats. Not to mention the doxing, the stalking, the efforts to ruin her career and so on. The only reason we can be talking somewhat nicely in here it is because the one talkin<b> g about</b> sexism and games is a man. I wish  Sharkeshian was a rare exception, but the criminal treatment dispensed to her and Zoe Quinn has pretty much become the standard treatment for any <b> femini</b>st woman that  gets some attention on the internet (and some man that speak in their favor... remember FEZ creator?).  \n\n...which brings me to the notion +Chief has introduced. I'm gonna argue that the imbalance in internet usage by men and women can be explained by comparing it with the imbalance in the job market and society in general. But when it comes to the internet, there's also the fear component to acc<b> ount f</b>or. Woman learn pretty soon to <b> hide th</b>eir gender online in order to avoid ran<b> dom hat</b>e or sexual objectification. They learn that they can be stalked or harassed and have their intimate life exposed.They sadly learn that, if that happens, they will be blamed for not being careful or prude enough, trusting the wrong person or pissing off the wrong people. That free speech is usually invoked to protect the men who are putting them down, but few of those men are willing or prepared to face the consequences of their freedom and their speech. They learn they can only interact safely in the traditional \"girl\" spaces,  and most of those just aim at teaching them how to be attractive, useful and decorative to lure men.  A society that tells half of it's population that they are all free an equal in theory, but they have to fear for their security if they decide to live as the other half is not a free society. Is a society that teaches  half of it's population that they are too weak to live with freedom. Is a society that does so because it is necessary in order to keep <b> both </b>genders dumb, divided and mindlessly consuming sexist crap.\n\nSee how ideas can flow when you don't need to surf past insults to read them?  Let's not dismiss the male chauvinistic assholes so easily,  because it is because of those loud <b> asshol</b>es that woman are afraid to voice their opinions and interact on the internet. Those assholes are the ones who convince them that all men on the internet are assholes,  because they are getting all the loud pissed-off assholes while the rest of us watch and eat popcorn. It is because of those assholes that we can't have nice things. But it is because of our silence that those assholes keep sprouting and convincing themselves they are heroes fighting for their oppressed brothers.",

We could debate more on the very definition or free speech vs hate speech, comparing this case with others like the Brandenburg v. Ohio; but that's not the issue. \n\nShe doesn't need to prove she can refute every single argument made against her, what kind of crap is that? Not only because most of the arguments made against her stances, feminism or <b> woman </b>are stereotypical, biased, or so uninformed that don't deserved to the dignified with an answer in the first place. She doesn't need to explain her position because she already does videos doing just that, go figure. If you want to close your eyes to<b>  sexism</b> in games be my guest. If you are worried about the issues but still you think she is exaggerating  and women don't have it so hard; you can contrast the data and opinions proposed by Anita elsewhere (like here for example). But take a moment to realize how differently we treat women vs men. Because she is a feminis<b> t woma</b>n in games context, she needs to refute any argument and prove that games are indeed misogynistic.  Do you demand the same from her detractors, do you ask them to prove how she's wrong, or do simply accept their ad hominem explanations? What about other influential men and women? Do you demand your boss, your tv stars, or even your politicians to publicly justify their every action and refute every single argument or opinion hurled against them? What makes Anita more dangerous or influential than Obama, that she needs to explain and justify her every word and action to prove she's right? No human being is 100% right all the time. A femini<b> st wom</b>an needs to be held to a higher moral standard than the rest in order to fight for her rights? Bullshit. Anyone saying that is just searching for an excuse to discredit her so they can keep ignoring sexist behavior.\n\nAnita herself is making modest changes at best, in truth is mainly all the hate directed towards her that is proving and exposing how sexist the industry, the internet and the society really are. It is because all the hate that people learn who she is and listen to what she says in the first place. Is all this stupid hate that is causing the women who still believed they were equal to wake up and worry about these issues for the first time. Men are waking up realizing also for the fist time that carrying yourself in life with a stupid boy's club attitude hurts the women you know and love, and your chances of developing a true connection with them eventually.The very fact that she can't allow comments in in her videos speaks volumes.",

You guys seem to think that just because she got a lot of responses criticizing her that's somehow hate. Well, it isn't. A huge amount of criticism doesn't equal hate, not in a million years. Besides, Scammers and charlatans SHOULD be criticized big time.\n\nNot saying she didn't get any hate at all, but who doesn't? Every personality with controversial opinions does. What she does is that she hides behind that and behind people like you to get her victim money.\n\nWake up dude.",

It couldn't be experience? Not all online game atmospheres are the same. Just because there isn't obvious <b> sexism </b>where you play, it doesn't mean that it's not real. Also, your perception on what is sexist may not be the same as women's.<b>  Sexism</b> against men is also very real, and not okay in my book either. What's interesting to me\u00a0though is that from my point of view men get treated badly especially if they have traits usually seen as female... such as being sensitive or soft. Wouldn't you agree?",

I would mic up, but I generally play single player games :3 I have recently started becoming more noticable by commenting on videos (like I am now haha). I think it has a lot do with playerbase too, more women are likely to play a game and get on the mic if they can hear, or know there are other women there, it makes everything less threatening, and you know if someone steps out of line, they are more likely to be called out on it.

Contrary to your guess, on PC it's not used more, it's used way way less, in my experience. I played multiple CoD games, Battelfield 3 and 4, both Titanfalls and voice chat is not something I have ever seen being used, ever. In Overwatch it's used sometimes, but quite rarely still. In higher competitive ranks I'm guessing it's used more, but again, it's not universally true. CSGO is probably one of the few games where voice communication is <b> common.</b>",

I will say that it definitely takes skill to play,  and playing it definitely isn't easy, but the general gameplay looks too samey to me. (It also seems like it'd be similar to cod in the sense that your own personal skill level means more than the team's skill level, and having a team full of players who have high skill but no teamwork is better than a full stacked team with less skill. i could be entirely wrong on that though.)",

Mass Effect also calculated how many players chose Femshep; 20%. Here we have two enormous franchises and the overwhelming majority of their audience are men. Funny how that works. Now I'll clarify it isn't a problem for girls to be into either game. Quite the opposite. You just cannot scream \"<b> sexism\"</b> when neither parent company goes out of their way to appeal to women. It's<b>  nothing</b> to do wit<b> h gende</b>r but marketing. A company isn't going to spend millions hoping more women play their game. \n\nIronically, BioWare tried appealing to the social justice crowd with Andromeda... and it failed spectacularly. Why? Because the people whining for \"inclusion!\" aren't actually going to buy the games. They just need something to blame for all their problems.",

They are pushing a narrative of feminism. \nThat he loves gaming does mitigate some of this. And while games might be sexist, does in no way make gamers sexist. There is no evidence of this. The same discussion was had over the violence in Mortal Kombat in 1994 to no avail. Violence has been on a steady decline since then and this is the same thing.\nWhat feminist often are saying is that things need to change and it needs to change NOW! \nNow consider the fact that attacking one of men\u00b4s and women\u00b4s favorite pass times and calling them sexist, <b> racist </b>or<b>  homophobic</b> because they play games doe<b> s NOTHIN</b>G, absolute<b> ly nothi</b>ng for change in video games.\nConsider the boiling o<b> f a f</b>rog. Do it gradually and<b>  the </b>frog doesn't notice. But put the heat on max and it will try to escape.\n\nLook at the latest polls. Majority of gamers, both men and women, have no problem with identifying with a character becau<b> se of g</b>ender, class, racer or what ever, as long as the character is well written.\n\nBack to the main concern here. And this is my main point. I love video games. Have played them all my life. Even violent and sexy games that sometimes are harmful to the pixilated characters. None of this has EVER made me treat anyone badly and I doubt that it would be different for most gamers. \nSure, sexist exists and and they will continue to do so, whether you change games or not.\nAnd trolls will always exist. They do not represent gamers as a whole. they only want to spark controversy. They are just as hated by gamers (or perhaps even more) just because they make conversations very hard.\n\nSo in conclusion. Calling all gamers s<b> exist, </b>racist and homophobes will only spark anger, rightful anger in my book.\nAnd trying to ban games that you don\u00b4t even play for one reason or another is only going to do the same.\nYou can have your opinions about everything and that is fine, but leave stuff that you don\u00b4t care about alone.\nGamers are people too and should be treated as such.\nThere has never been a more diverse group of people that like the same thing in the history of the world.\nSo let things run their course. With more women playing games, the developers will come around, because they like the big green wads of cash. Forcing them to change is not the way to handle this.\n\nSo with that said. I have been civil and factual here. And I hope to get the same in return so we can start having decent debates and conversations that don\u00b4t end in name calling.",

In the 90's games were blamed for: street crime, violence against women (this one seems to have returned), and muhsogyny. Only then it was the far right. Now it's the far left doing the same damn thing. Here's what gamers are REALLY tired of:\nPeople who don't play games attempting to inject their personal politics into other peoples hobbies, and telling them what to do by using shaming language, humiliation, and painting them as abusers. I may not be a gamergater, but honestly I can see why something like gamergate formed. It was just bound to happen given the current social climate. People are just tired of it in general. What makes it worse is the dude in the talk just compounds it. Here's the thing though: if women want more representation in the industry MAKE A GAME!! There is literally <b> NOTHING </b>stopping people from making their own games. The gaming world is about meritocracy.<b>  Nobody</b> really gives a shit about skin color<b> , rac</b>e, or religion.

The only thing missing is cringing feminists. Does this mangina think he is going to get laid for this irrelevant drivel? Go ahead Paul, you be you. Why can't people play the games they want to play? Are you going to force boys to play with dolls too? This is like complaining that sanitary pads are made for women. Guess what! Sanitary pads are made for women. Any company making sanitary pads for men is just going to go broke. No, but some politically correct arse like you is going to insist they make some for men just to uphold your version of reality. \n\nNow let's<b>  gender</b> neutral \"My Little Pony.\"  \n\nIf women want to have some other archetype, go out there and become one. There are great women out there, they just don't fit the mold that you--Mr Verhoeven--have made for them.",

FFX-2 in particular is infamous for it's squeaky scantily clad ladies giggling their way through a love story. You would never see a AAA title risk its budget positioning a <b> woman </b>the same way they would Master Chief - an unequivocal badass whose character development doesn't require a love interest or starting from a weak place. She starts out strong and stays strong, kicking ass and taking names. I would name Sylvannas from WC3 if they didn't stick her in a bikini in WoW. As a<b>  woman</b> trying to identify with the women in my video games or use them as my \"female power fantasy\"  in the same way men can act out their \"male power fantasies,\" it's super difficult to find a game where th<b> e woma</b>n isn't<b>  a s</b>ex object in one way or another.\n\nalso, fuck off right with that \"fake gamer\" GG bull. you don't know me or my tastes. That whole \"how many games do I have to play in order to qualify as a gamer\" is an entirely different argument I don't quite feel like engaging in.",

We gave you plenty of games with female protags. Some of those women are not scantly clad at all but you either pretend you never heard about it to prove your point or you are just not into games as much as you think you are.\nI am sorry we are not here to show you how many games out there to cater towards you and people like you. Thats your job to look what you want to play.\nStop expecting specific games aimed towards \"mostly\" male gamers to feeding your demand while you are not the one who is buying it.\n\n\"I guess my point is that when the average human thinks of AAA game characters, they think guys: Super Mario, Master Chief, GTA series, Witcher, GoW, God of War, etc.\"\nAverage human doesn't mean gamers. Average gamers know plenty of games from popular titles but only play the ones they like.\nI didn't play half of the games you list in there because those are not really my style but i didn't go out shame the industry. There are people who like these games leave them be. You have unlimited options yet you choose to be dick to others.",

You actually try to identify with the characters in the games you play? These are fictional people whose only job is set dressing for your gameplay experience. Whether it's a protagonist or an NPC, a game puts gameplay before storyline. You're not expected to identify with anyone. Do you think we men seriously want to identify with a criminal in GTA, or a US colonialist gun in Just Cause, or an adventurer in a fictional setting like in Zelda?\nHere's a bit of wisdom for you. I don't identify with any of the protagonists I have played with. Every protagonist could be female for all I care it's mainly about the game. The other reason why games like Halo have chief males? Because as per in real life and around us, men take up jobs like soldiers, commanders, henchmen, drug lords, criminals etc. I'm pretty sure that if the crime statistics were balanced and more women were seen committing the same level of heinous crime we'd have no problem imagining a female in GTA. But what do we know, maybe then everyone would be like \"OMG they put<b>  a wom</b>an in this game where she gets shot at. Violence against women\".\nAlso, what's the deal with being sexy? It's like the fem<b> ale gen</b>der is completely aversive to the idea of sexiness and beauty for women. I'm not saying that I'd take offence to some games with female protagonists having sexy men in thongs. Go ahead and do it, game devs. Some eye candy for the female gaze. News flash: A lot of women do like to put on sexy skimpy armor even in RPGs when playing online, because they'd never do it IRL. So people like you don't represent the demands of most women or all women, just like people who demand photorealistic graphics in all games don't represent the majority that consumes games for gameplay and not necessarily flashy visuals.",

Speaking as a <b> woman,</b> I think the biggest thing I have a problem with is that there are imbalances of how characters are portrayed in video games. I don't usually have a problem with female characters who look or act unrealistic when a male character is equally as ridiculous. Let me put things in perspective. If there was a video game where a<b>  woman</b> is fully clothed while the guy was half naked and his muscles/junk were moving in an unrealistic way while they were in battle, you probably wouldn't play the game and I wouldn't blame a guy for not wanting to. Imagine if a bulk of video games were like that. I know I'm over exaggerating, but I think you get my point. It would probably piss guys off. I probably would be a casual gamer if there were more games that didn't have that \"boys only\" feel to it. By the way, I have no problem when games target towards certain people, but I would like to find games that have characters I could relate to more frequently then I am now. I think it would make for even better game play to be honest, because it adds more depth to the game.",

I never thought I would care about something like that, a person is a person right? But it does matter after I played a few games that had strong female leads. It changes the experience completely.

Differences in their \"brain road maps\" (scientifically known as \"the connectome\") can explain why males outperform females on certain tests \nof<b>  mental</b> skills, while females have the edge in others. \n\nWe know that hormones influence brain development in the womb, yet \nbefor<b> e ag</b>e 13, boys' and girl<b> s' ment</b>al circuitry appears similar. During\n puberty, hormones may again have a powerful effect and contribute to rewriting the teen brain.\nIt turned out that maybe 6 in every 100 of the brains they studied were \nconsistently a sin<b> gle </b>sex. Many others had a patchwork quilt of \nmasculine and feminine features that varied widely from person to \nperson.\nWomen have more connections going left and right across the two \nhalves of the brain. This could give them an advantage in pulling \ntogether information from different sources and drawing conclusions. The\n left half of the brain handles logical thinking, and the right is \nassociated with intuition.Men's brains have more connections from front to back, which \nmay heighten their perception. They may be more attuned to what's going \non around them so they can take action. Men have stronger connections \nbetween brain areas for motor and spatial skills. That means males tend \nto do a better job at tasks that need hand-eye coordination and \nunderstanding where objects are in space, such as throwing a ball or \nhammering a nail.MRIs showed the biggest gaps between the sexes were the larger amount of\n gray matter women had in their hippocampus, a structure that plays a \nrole in memory, and the left caudate, which is thought to control our \ncommunication skills. Verma found that in female brains, there's more \nwiring in regions linked to memory and social cognition. So is it \nsurprising that women tend to be better at understanding how other \npeople are feeling and knowing the right way to respond in social \nsituations?When your brain processes the same signals over and over, those networks\n will get stronger, like working out a muscle. So even if male and \nfemale brains start out similar, they may become different over time as \nboys and girls are treated differently with different expectations.''It confirms <b> that ge</b>nder is partially a social construct, but not completely. I believe just that.\n\nOther source: \n''with 50 percent of men and 48 percent of women saying they played video \ngames on a console, PC, or handheld device. Despite this, men are much \nmore likely to self-identify as \"gamers\" than their female counterparts,\n and both men and women generally assume that most video game players \nare men.''\nI couldn't find a source that gave exact numbers about casual vs. hardcore female gamers. I guess I have to base my opinion on real life experiences then.",

Remember when he showed that South Park picture? \n\n''The number of girls and women who said they played Microsoft and Sony's \nbig consoles at least five days a week in 2014 was more than 5 million''\nAnd how many males do that? I bet a lot more. \n\n''Which begs a broader question: are more women playing mobile games because women are more interested in mobile games? Or is it because they have been told, over and over again, that 'proper' games are not for them? ''\nWho's telling that? Not by the boys obsessing with ''girl gamers''. Maybe by their parents. Then again, parents generally don't like the idea of their kid being a gamer and most gamers are adults anyway. The fact remains that most blockbuster titles depict violence and often muddy dark colors. Girls generally not liking those things is a way bigger and more complicated issue than just gaming and in the end it doesn't even matter. Also, adapting to social norms is your own problem, not that of gaming/marketing companies. \n\n''Therefore, what would there be to conform to<b> ?

Then again, there are PS3 and Xbox 360 sales numbers and they are huge. Something like 190 million combined.\n\n''Women are 100% fine with muted colors and violence. What do you think, they're all children or something?''\nBut seriously, girls often prefer things with bright colors. Even if it's a social construct, they do. When I was 13, a teacher showed paintings in the classroom. The girls liked colorful stuff, boys liked realistic stuff. I didn't care about both of those things and I just liked something when I liked it. You keep asking me to do research, but do you have any proof that girls like muted colors just as much as bright colors?\n\n''Might as well point out that the ones \"telling them that\" are also the ones telling them that they should only wear pink sparkly dresses and plastic barbie shoes.''\nWho are telling them that? People aren't told to do shit. They just imitate what they see around them. It's a choice.\n\n''It's also quite silly of you to say that women rather than getting games that actually cater to them should adapt to social norms and just stop liking video games.''\nI never said that. Also, games are not made to cater. Games are made to make money.\n\n''There would be no <b> gender </b>norms to conform to, is what I'm saying. This goes for men too. The day where anyone can act and dress as they like (within ethics, obviously) without being questioned will be a great day indeed. Who says a guy can't rock a pleated skirt? Not me.

People who don't want diversity in games are usually the ones that benefit from the lack of it.\n\nAs gaming becomes a more mainstream part of society around the world, it is obviously problematic to have a complete lack of strong female characters in them. Games are meant for escapism, thats true, but escapism into what? A world where sexist white men are in charge? Its important to have diverse characters because more and more people are being exposed to it. As there are clear links between gaming and behavior, its important to enforce behavior that isn't biased toward any one minority.\u00a0\n\nAnd the answer to someone saying, \"games should have more diverse characters\" shouldn't be, \"keep the games where straight white men are dominant and just make more.\" Its inherently problematic for popular companies that make games to continue creating only strong white men as the protagonists.",

                    "commentText": "+Sophie Sanderfer This was quite intersting to read through. First of, i'm not trying to attack you here, but i noticed that you dismissed pretty much all of Juventins points and you never brought any evidence for your claims and you saw him as part of this \"problem\" which i find ridiculous. Most gamers don't care what <b> gender </b>the character has or colour, what matters is if the game is any good or the story for that matter. But you seem to be offended if you have to play as a white male character and i personally find that to be actually \"problematic\". \n\nDo you really think GTAV would have been a better game if a female character was in the lead? The answer is no, it would be the same game. But here is the thing, the writers of Rockstar created the story of this game with these characters in mind and its their right to do so. If they forced a female lead character into the story which they constructed just to please feminists then they would have to rewrite everything and the narrative would have suffered. Of course if the story was written with a female lead in mind from the very beginning then thats something completely different. \n\nBut look at Ubisoft, they really tried to satisfy the feminst audience by forcing this inclusivity into their games and then they got even more critizied for it by them. Its always a lose-lose situation because they never will be satisfied, they find always something to complain about. \n\nLots of AAA games are catered to a male audience (world wide btw, make from that info what you will), thats because in this gaming sector most of the audience is male. Saying 50% of gamers are female is dishonest because these numbers also take mobile gaming into account and these people wouldn't be really interested in blockbuster gaming anyway and thats just the reality of it. But to say there are almost no games with great female leads is simply not true because there are so many out there and that makes me believe you don't play many games in the first place. For every game you show me which has a white male protagonist i can show you 10 more games with great female leads. \n\nIf you actually look into the medium then you will see there is no problem. But if you really think there is then do as Joventis said and make your own games. Everyone can express and create what they want and thats so great about the medium and art in general. But not all games are for everyone just like movies and music and thats absolutely ok. If you want to force everything so it appeals for you is imo cencorship and against freedom of speach. If you don't like a game because the content offends you then play something else because there is plenty to choose from.",

You trying to say it isn't not only makes you selfish but it's you stupid. One is offensive to some while the other doesn't take time for you to be offend because you are already dead. It's also funny that fictional characters seem to be more important over here ten women being beaten to death for wanting better themselves through education.

Basically every single one of those protagonists is a gang member, or a former gang member.  I'm not saying that they shouldn't make games like these anymore, because those stories still exist and should be told, but wouldn't it be nice if there was a playabl<b> e blac</b>k main protagonist in a fantasy, mystery or a sci-fi game, as opposed to just the usual default white male?? There is a lot of misdirected anger right now towards feminism by other vulnerable communities, but in reality what they are talking about is promoting equality and better representation for all groups, including t<b> he bla</b>ck community.

I did not purchase GTA 5 for 80 AUD for a political message I did so for the game the same way I did Nekopara. Games are not about appeasing a political agenda or pandering to one side of the political spectrum. Since GTA 3 they have been about freedom, freedom for the creator to express themselves and freedom for the user. If representation is so good that it must be push into all media, then allow creators right to decide on there own. Oh wait I almost forgot no one does because there is no reason for it and so called representation is meaningless. There is no base in science for any of this. Also try making a steam account and or buying a console actually play some games. Your channel is almost exclusively based on music and you have not one item of gaming content. Not to mention that according to google plus you have watched only one video related to gaming. I might be wrong about that but in all honestly you are far from qualified to give council on representation. In other words actually play some games before making comments like that.",

Why can't I pick up, beat up and pay for<b>  sex</b> from scantily clad, poorly written, non satirical male background characters, while playing as a properly dressed, well written female lead character? Sure games are escapism, and they allow for the acting out of fantasies without consequences, but that in no way means that they aren't, or should be, overly sexist. Personally, I play games for the story aspect, but always, while playing older games, such as Pokemon, I pretended the main player character was female. I love how games such as Skyrim allow for male and female main player characters, and have a lesser level o<b> f sexis</b>m in their non player characters, depicting the women with functional armour and non skimpy clothing. As<b>  a wom</b>an, I am a market for the gaming industry, not just for meaningless puzzle games, but for games with in-depth storylines and characterisation. Popular games should not be made exclusively for men or a male audience. Lets be clear that I don't want non gendered, non explicit games, I want violent, gory, story-centric games with the scope to allow for many playstyles, without\u00a0women being depicted as objects. Unless, of course, male characters are equally depicted as\u00a0objects in humiliating and dehumanising situations, such as\u00a0the situations for women in GTAV. And I do not believe this is an reasonable demand. If the developer would not put a male character in that situation, they should not be\u00a0putting a female character in that situation.",

GTA 5 sold so well it broke records, that is to say the least a functional set ideas for a business and the consumer loves it. Thus they vote with their wallets and win the election. Games are a product and they are tailored to whoever buys them. Many men hold the view that the term<b>  sexism</b> is a buzz word rather than a meaningful criticism of media. Then there are the ones that simply do not care, for this reason I paid full price for the pre release of GTA 5. I take no issue with any part of the game and I see no reason to. It is what I like and thus it is what I buy. But in all honesty I could write about my own feelings all day. But rather than doing that I will give you advice and little bit of encouragement. It is clear to me that you do not like games as they are, frankly to each their own. But as a bit of a spoiler the game industry isn't really going to change that much over the next few decades. People have tried to make innovations and to do things differently, valve tried doing exactly that. The portal series was created and it was a success. But compared to Counter Strike & Half Life it was a complete failure. Then Valve did what all businesses do go where the money is and that was CS and HL. But as you said you are a market and I am certain there are many women like yourself that share these views. So I would suggest you follow in the footsteps of Elon Musk and create a product. You see a problem and you have a demographic, so like Elon did make a product to appeal to people like you. If you want games to change you need to make one, incorporate your ideas and produce a product and be successful. Because if you don't the nex<b> t woma</b>n most likely won't, in fact if you won't then I think the answer to the question is really quite clear. Because you won't and many women won't, you say you want change but you don't create that very change. But who know I might be wrong, if I am I will gladly review the product you have created. In the end if you want change then a game is the best argument for that change few women have risen to the challenge. However you can put your ideas to the ultimate test.\nPlease do so",

The storyline in GTA which almost no one plays has<b>  black</b> and white males and I'm ok with that because i and loads of others don't play the shit anyway. They let you just like with a bunch of other games nowadays COD for example play as a female character if you wish. They do actually look and listen because a year or so back COD only had male playable characters. In a parody world were the males are actually treated worse representation really shouldn't be the main issue. You complain about the same thing but as a \"white looking\" women you are in the same boat as the people you are accusing, their is more then enough representation of you too. Just like we minorities are always told if we want representation we have to create it ourselves. Not to mention the developers are going to make things that are going to sell. If you don't like the game don't buy it. It was the same with comics, majority are still white people, white males and they are going to make what sells.",

Personally, I also have to keep open minded about other styles and sport martial art. I\u00a0remind myself that\u00a0even though\u00a0it is sport martial art, it still counts.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is, even though there is an agenda(s), and game developers should not conform to agenda(s), this should not stop them from being considerate of\u00a0others.\n\nYes, quality is the most important part. I do not propose to give\u00a0restraints to developers, but it would be nice if they tried. If they don't try, I'll probably end up playing the game anyway, because\u00a0of quality, but it would be nice for more game developers to just try (and not just for sandbox games!!!)",

Sometimes it seems as though game designers just think, oh girls wouldn't want to play this, so lets not make a female player option.

Women and men are about 50% of the population each.\n\nOr maybe you mean the game player 's demographic, not the demographic of the general national / world population. But then you are suggesting that a game player should be a sexist / <b> woman </b>objectifier.  If anything to me that is to make anti-moralizing assumptions about your game player audience. There's something seriously wrong with us and our society if we expect or worse, can expect the audience to not be able to relate to a<b>  woman</b> character as literally anything but <b> a sexua</b>l object or at least, as primarily<b>  a sexu</b>al object and only secondarily as a human and literally, if we gave anything else, the game would be hated and reviled so badly that even if it had the best storylines, best gameplay mechanic, the best everything, it would tank and fail like one couldn't believe. Absurdity to the heights!\n\nAnd yes I say it's culture, not \"the nature of the human male\" or whatever. I am a male. Yes I <b> get sex</b>ual attraction to women. BUT I can also relate to them as more than just that and even primarily more than that. If our gamers can't, or a lot of them can't, that is a big problem with our society and culture.\n\nOh yeah and I am getting into making games. This is something I am paying real attention to.",

What you're suggesting is that games will somehow become worse if more diverse characters are created.\n\nDo you know what a gamer is? A person who plays games. There is no such thing as a \"fake\" gamer. People who say that there is are usually the type of people to complain about the lack of women in games and in the same breath say that girls already in games are faking it.\n\nAnd thats not true. Or, by some studies, not enough to make a difference. Most studies suggest that men and women in the gaming community are pretty evenly split up, here are some sources:\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/18/52-percent-people-playing-games-women-industry-doesnt-know\n\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/researchers-find-that-female-pc-gamers-outnumber-males/\n\nhttp://www.statista.com/statistics/232383/gender-split-of-us-computer-and-video-gamers/\n\nps: I never suggested I had some moral high ground. And \"harassment?t\"\u00a0\n???\nWe have very different definitions of harassment my friend. What I did, which was asking for more diverse characters in popular games, is most certainly not harassment. And The way you see it, me forcing creators to make this happen, isn't real. I can encourage it all I want, as can lots of the gaming community, that isn't me forcing anything on anyone.",

Even Mayim Bialik, one of the main actresses, has a PHD in neuroscience. If the show truly were \"insulting\" to people knowledgeable in science, how come they have such huge support from the scientific community? They've had guests appearances from numerous scientists, including Stephen Hawking, and Lawrence Krauss and Neil Degrasse Tyson have both noted it amongst their favourite shows. I could understand why you might feel dumber watching Friends or New Girl or something, but TBBT is so much more mature and eloquently written.",

I was making the point that if that were the case then it is strange that the show is so well regarded by scientists across the board, from those who supervise the scripts to those that appear on the show, to those who are just fans of the show. \n\nIt's fine that you don't like the show, we all have different tastes, but your arrogance in dismissing the show as science for laymen is entirely unjustified. Are we to ignore people like Hawking, Nye, Krauss and Wozniak and their support of the show? I started watching the show because some of my friends loved it and recommended it. They ended up becoming engineering and physics majors. \nRegardless, if you watched the show you would realise that the science element, although fundamental, is more of a prop to talk about the real theme, which is social interaction and exclusion versus inclusion. It's refreshing in how it (with the help of Sheldon, arguably a character with Asperger's Syndrome) interrogates social conventions and tropes. It has well-rounded, interesting characters, well-paced, well-written dialogue, and it does its best to avoid cliches. I don't see what your problem is.",

First off, he's criticizing this one game as sexist, and then pointing out that the <b> sexism </b>of the community is clear in people's response to even light criticism about the portrayal of women. Guys, he loves gaming. He literally just said that you have to care about something to speak at length about it, and he's a game critic. He loves games, and he's not attacking them. He's suggesting how video games can be even better. Don't be satisfied with the status quo-- games are an interactive storytelling artform and I love them for that, and art has critics and critics make art better. \n\nIt's okay to acknowledge something isn't perfect and still love it. You can still enjoy a game that's sexist for its other features-- GTA is /fun/. Nobody's denying that. When critics say GTA is sexist, it's not a personal attack against you for liking it. \n\nAnd I think that's the problem with the gaming community when it responds to accusations of<b>  sexism</b> in games: the guys don't /want/ to be seen as sexist, so they insist that their games aren't, because they take the criticism as an attack on them for liking it. And then, feeling like they've been personally attacked, they get defensive. Which, in the end, makes them look even more sexist. \n\nAcknowledge that there's problems, guys. Love games anyways, but just acknowledging that the problem exists is the first, and most key, step to those problems going away.",

Like I said, I suspect it's a defensive thing rather than intend to offend, but defending these things and ignoring their problems is infinitely worse than saying, \"Yeah, you're right-- but I still like playing it.\"\u00a0\n\n*Footnote:\u00a0Honestly, I think there's very little excuse for a sandbox-type game not to have the option for the lead to be female, simply because male players do use that option too (especially in third-person gameplay games where the guy gets to look at his character moving-- not that I'm judging or that there's anything wrong with that, just making an observation). Just having the option for the main character to be male or female and experience the same story offers something a little deeper than the women-purely-as-objects-and-eyecandy, even if those female player character options still do serve as eyecandy. Given, I haven't played /this/ GTA, so I don't know if it has this or not for sure, but it sure sounds like it doesn't, so.",

GTA is a great game and i wouldn't really want it to change honestly, but i understand someone could see it as sexist. \n\nNow, is it really that bad for a game to be sexist? I mean, admitting a game IS sexist, then what? many games are violent, it doesn't mean they make people violent. And i think sexist games doesn't make people sexist, so if you find it funny to have a game where boobs bounce well, why not? Women aren't forced to play it.\n\u00a0But in the review of the game, the critic can say he finds the game sexist, so the people reading this will know, and maybe some girls that wanted to play it will not. He can even take 1point away and give it a 9/10 and not a 10/10 because for him, th<b> e sexis</b>m is a -. Then what? You can still play and enjoy it, even if it's got a 9/10 and is considered sexist by some.\n\nI just hope people could change a bit of mentality. You can very well accept a game can be considered sexist and not insult the guy who said that, even if you don't agree. (as you just did, and that is nice :D)\nOn the other hand i hope he doesn't mean to \"destroy\" those games and put an end to all sexist games. But I don't think so, if he still gives a 9/10 to GTA.\n\nI hope i have not annoyed you with all that text and you've read it all hahah, have a good day sir!\n\n\n\njust a last thought:in cinema Transformers is considered by many as sexist, and there's no problem with that. it's targeted for men, and it ends here.",

                    "commentText": "+Diil Avery Sorry did I miss something? Is someone trying to ban these types of games?\nI think it is important to aknowlage that a game is sexist if thats what it is. As you have said, we allow the same treatment of games for all other criteria, why not be able to talk about <b> sexism </b>in it?\nBeing able to like even love something and still be avare of its flaws and criticize it is a very basic human thing. \nI also think that having a conversation about it and being able to criticize a game for it is a necessary step to moving forward. And by moving forward I dont mean lets never make a game like GTA, I mean having more variety in games. There are so many games out there in which<b>  nothing</b> in the lines of gameplay or storytelling would change if the protagonist was female. I personally also never saw  a gamer that didnt play a game simply because it was a female character, hell, I know a lot of men who choose to play as females if the choice is given to them. \nI dont think the argument of ''just dont play and dont give them your money'' is enough though. We need to have this conversation and support the companies to do other stuff too. Lets be honest, the companies that make the big games and have the biggest profits right now, are going to be scared to lose money by trying something different. Having a conversation might make them see that maybe making a game that doesnt follow these things so closely wont lose them money. Its the same argument that was had about movies, and to some extent it still is. When the conversation about all male protagonists in movies started, everyone believed it was the only way to make money, that thats ''simply what people want'', that people wouldnt want to watch women in lead roles and that was reserved for chick-flicks. But then we had some of the top box office films like Burtons Alice, Gravity, Hunger games etc. \nAnd lastly I think its pretty lazy, while I like the sexy female characters as much as anyone, I would just love to see some more interesting design. And having sexy half naked women doesnt grant much in design. If the idea is she has to be conventionaly hot, and have the least clothes possible you will end up with very little you can do, in terms of physical appearance and clothing design. Example, I love the way Aveline form assasins creed looks like, and I think we can agree her costume would be a lot less interesting if she was half naked, just well, for the sheer lack of something to work with. And considering all the female characters have to be young it ends up being much of the same. Again Im not saying lets not have sexy women in tight (or very little clothing) ever again, Im just saying more variety in character design would be fun.",

He puts a bunch of quotes from obvious trolls and treats them as the beliefs as gamers as a whole. This guy is as sexist towards other men as he claims gamers are to women. \nHe expects the whole industry and gamers as a whole to change their companies, past times and passions to fit a few new people coming in. Its not the problem the gaming community is sexist and just want to push women away and make it a boys club, its the fact SJWs are coming in, demanding that everyone bend their whim and conform to them and gamers feel attacked. Yes there are some people who are sitting in the corner like he said, shaking their fists, their called TROLLS, most gamers will welcome you if you want to work WITH them. SJWs want to command gamers to do what they want and gamers react. You know theres this thing you can do, its called \"not buy the sexist videogaes\".\n\n\u00a0He also acts like all these guys are just getting along and then ganging up on women/girls who come in, thats stupid.

I don't go crying and saying its about my<b>  gender</b> o<b> r rac</b>e (I'm white and I sound very stereotypical white) and I have been called the N word plenty of times on online games. Personally I just turn it around and start making fun of them and you can very often get the to leave. There are lots of women who turn off their head sets for voice chat when playing and I have heard that used as a way to prove that women are attacked in online gaming, but I have heard just as many men say they do it to.

A fucking videogame can't express the creator's ideology in things like equality, because CHARACTERS can be sexist and that doesn't make the creator sexist. Saying that GTA is sexist is like saying that it's violent. That doesn't make the creator a bad person. (and again, GTA is violent but isn't sexist)",

Edgar Allen Poe's novels were blamed for suicides. The Grimm brothers fairy tales were banned in Germany and blamed as one of the causes for German people allowing WWII.\n\nYes, GTA, and many, many other games, include a long list of different stereotype characters that build part of the environment those games have. In a game about violent crime where vanity, low education and corruption is everywhere you will get an awful lot of these stereotypes. Most characters in the entire GTA game series are not very developed, because it's not important for the game that they are making and would often detract from the focus of the game. Why on earth is anyone making the argument that works of fiction need to portray nuanced rolemodels and avoid stereotypes?\n\nI have no quarrels with any game developers for making the game they want. This game is supposed to be sexist, racially insensitive, bigoted and explicitly violent. There are games that are the complete opposite of the GTA series, and other game developers will create their own realities for players to interact with. Games, movies, books etc. are about entering a fictional realm. GTA is a game where most people will gun down generic unintelligent police officers, and most story-related policemen are corrupt, by the hundreds at a time, is that a massive problem that doesn't give nuance to police officers? No, because it's make pretend. There are plenty of games I don't play because I'm not interested in their pretend world. I don't demand that they change their pretend world into a place I personally would like more.",

Demanding <b> sexism </b>should be removed from games is unrealistic. Would you ban nudity from art, or swearing and cursing from comedy?\n\nSomething to add though... I would like to point out the gigantic fallacy that the OP and the likes committed. The main point initially made was that<b>  sexism</b> existed in games and gamers should admit this and not worry about being sexist. Next they claim that it's not necessarily video games that are sexist, it's more the defensive stance the gamers take that is sexist. Make up your damn mind.",

I do agree that some people within the gaming community are sexist and do have rape culture... but I also believe that not differentiating between the entire gaming community and people within it is going to make ALOT of actually decent people go straight into the defensive which makes them come across as something they are not, and it is also detrimental to the cause...\n\nPutting abit of thought into the words we choose can be very helpful in any situation \nAnd whilst everyone makes mistakes and I don't believe anyone is trying to attack the entire gaming community, it can very easily feel that way when they don't choose their words carefully :)\n\nBut overall I feel you make an excellent point ^_^",

So of course you'll find them on the defence constantly, because something they like is being attacked, often on baseless grounds.\n\nThe entire GTA-series has always been about portraying the worst in people. Do we have to turn women into a protected group, in order for it not to be seen as sexist? If you have a history with GTA, you KNOW the tone of the series, you KNOW that it's horribly violent, at times extremely sexist and super offensive. I have always HATED the main characters in the GTA-series, but that's what has made it fun to play: It clearly displays everything that's wrong with humanity and forces you to take part in it, something that has time and time again been proven to be beneficial for psychological development.\n\nThere will always be sexist people, just like there will always be racists, bigots and psychopaths - If we don't portray this in our entertainment, we'll only shield ourselves from something fictional, until we meet it in real life.\nI've learned a lot of my higher social skills through video games, starting at a very young <b> age.</b> Seeing past skin-colour,  being nice to people regardless of their background, seeing past differences and finding a<b>  common</b> ground.\nThose are not skills I picked up in school, they're primarily things I learned because I delved into darker, fictional worlds.\n\nWe grow the most when faced with adversity, if you take that away from society, then what will we become?",

It is very typical and sexist that the female, even though being marvelous and brilliant for parts of the game, becomes damseled.\n\nHe's obviously well educated on the matter and has opened his eyes for this <b> sexism,</b> and I am not at all surprised there are angry sexist shrieking boys in the comments. And as he mentions, if it had been a female saying these exact words the backlash would have been even bigger. It's ridiculous, but the world is full of these horrible boys ruining it for everyone else.",

Because, I hate to tell you this, man, but a lot of girls hide their <b> gender </b>on online games to avoid issues. I've talked to girls who won't turn on their mic without a voice changer, use male avatars and neutral usernames, and in general, just pretend to be guys. Or stay offline completely. If I've got hundreds of hours in the single player campaign but haven't gone online, does that disclude me from being a \"real\" gamer because you can't see me doing it? \n\nHonestly, my local game store is staffed by about an equal amount of men and women, and has about equal division of customers at any given moment, too. I'll admit, I've not been to a convention, but, c'mon, games are expensive as it is! Haha. \n\n\nMy point: individual experience isn't a good indicator of statistics. Don't rely on your perception.\n\n\nThe other day I was playing a game-- online and very social in content, and one of the guys I'm playing with goes, \"You know, I wish there were more girls on this game. There are so few.\" And I was really confused for a moment, because I hadn't noticed that at all. I thought that that particular game had more girls than guys. It just came off to me as a more girly game, and I was introduced to it with one of my female friends, but then I looked at the split of avatar genders, and realized that in most games, there /were/ more guys than girls. I hadn't even noticed before it was pointed out to me.",

You can be in the virtual world what you cannot even imagine to be in the real world. here, you get to be the <b> old </b>school \"man\" with women as second class. it's their dream, realized in the form of gaming. any criticism to it, will make them question morality and they aren't emotionally intelligent enough. Some women have really ruined it for the rest of the world with fake feminism, and  the sexist lot of the men have have used this as an opportunity to fend the women's concerns away.\nYes,women don't play the so called \"real games\", as opposed to , say, candy crush, because straight women are not exactly into other women, and the latter has a sense of \"unisex-ness\" to it. the gaming industry is so heavily marketed towards men, its subconsciously fed into women's minds this is not for them.\n\nAnita Sarkesian is shit, but that doesn't change the fact that gaming industry is sexist.\n\nDont be afraid, males, you can play, it love it, but still acknowledge<b>  sexism</b>. thats not mutually exclusive. a real man, has to have some major balls to say something is wrong if its wrong.",

            "commentText": "I disagree with him slightly, on the subject of GTA V. Really, the same things he's accusing GTA V of could equally be said of the recent Tomb Raider game - the male characters in Tomb Raider have no agency, don't have any sort of character or story arc, etc. The fact is, the characters in GTA are bank robbers, and a trio of female bank robbers is not all that believable, because robbing banks is historically an overwhelmingly male pursuit. Still, it would have been nice if at least one of the characters had been a <b> woman.</b> In a game with more than two playable characters, it shows a complete lack of imagination when none of them are female.\nAlso, on the statistic that 47% of gamers are women, so what? Even if only 10% of gamers were women, there should still be 50% of the playable characters being women, because that's the proportion of women to men in the world. The idea that male/female characters in videogames should match the proportions of gamers suggests that men can only play men and women can only play women. Just because I'm a man, that doesn't mean I can only control male characters in a video game - I can play quite happily while controlling a female character. The<b>  sex</b> of the character isn't important, unless the player is 8 and thinks girls are icky. Surely we need to get beyond that ridiculous level of immaturity.\nFortunately, the imbalance is starting to go away, a bit. At least we have Lara Croft, and we recently got Until Dawn, a game that has an equal mix of male and female characters, in which the women characters are generally more interesting than the men, which is a nice surprise. On the other hand, we still get games like Metal Gear Solid 5, with its female characters that seem to b<b> e nothin</b>g more than masturbation fantasies for teenaged boys.\nSo there's a long way to go, and I'm glad to see someone so succinctly explaining the main issues faced by those of us who care abo<b> ut gend</b>er equality.",

Even the latest Nintendo statistics suggest that 93% of the players are male, and Nintendo are about as family friendly and female-friendly as AAA games can get! So is it any surprise that these developers are capitalizing on their demography's interests? Because guess what, when you have a fanbase consisting almost entirely of men, presenting some sexy ladies, cars, guns and action is a good way to get them interested. The same way if you have a female fanbase consisting of entirely women, presenting sexy men and celebrities, fashion and whatnot is a good way to get them interested. This is how business works and no matter how hard the small group of feminazis scream, the rest of the population is speaking with their wallets. The cries of <b> sexism </b>and violence didn't stop 55 million people picking up the new GTA V, and that statistic does include women!",

Male prostitutes would be in games if there was a female market that wanted it (capitalism in gaming). Seeing as those games with male prostitutes have never dominated for the male or female demographic proves that no one is seriously interested in it NOT because o<b> f sexis</b>m in games.\n\nYou seriously believe there is not ONE gaming company in the world that would want to capitalize on this apparently HUGE market of women interested in naked men in games. Oh yes, those wealthy game producers only want to continue selling games with sexy women because they would rather have a boy's club than make a dollar. Wake up!\n\nIf there was money to be made with sexy men in games SOMEONE would capitalize on it. The fact that no one has shows that the demographic of people that want naked men and male prostitutes is too small to support a team of game designers.\n\nBTW there are Japanese games with naked men or sexualized males, but Japan cannot find a market for it in the U.S.A, so they have mostly discontinued selling games with naked males. (Look up a game Cho Anika to see an example of a game that failed in the US market with naked men)",

Why do you say impossibly handsome like as if there isn't handsome men or any way to get the muscles In real life? Also why did you say impossible beautiful women when it is possible to be beautiful, curvy, fit, and etc? All you need to do is just work out and you'll get that curvy body. I don't see how it's impossible. No games is targeted to just <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>men. It actually a fact that even women watch shows or read abou<b> t g<b> a</b</b>>y characters. Like most of the people who<b>  do<b>  </b</b>>gay shipping are females. Most people who read yaoi Manga are women. So how having  companys target gays isn't somehow targeting women? Aren't a lot of<b>  ti<b> m</b</b>>e gay men become feminine and start acting like women? Which a lot of the time they do. At least  through out all the games I played for almost 20 years, there been more men that what you wou<b> ld call</b> sexual objects then women. Not that many games actually have fan service and barley any games show women showing their bare tits. Out of anything you should be fighting for more female characters being sexy to match with the ratio male characters being handsome.",

                    "commentText": "Firstly, the are different degrees of feminism and misogynism. What I am saying though is that if you aren't sexist then you are a feminist. Most people seem to not quite understand that, feminism is basically just <b> gender </b>equality (in its simplest Form), and if you do not support it then you will be to a degree sexist, because you can't not be sexist and not be a feminist, looking at the true definition. \n   Now, I'm not entirely sure why you say that it's mostly male feminists who assault women. That's really suggesting that all women who get raped are by men who value equality for both sexes?  That doesn't really make sense. I don't doubt that there will be some people who declare themselves feminist and may still assault women. However, the majority will not be by people who consider themselves feminists. They will be by misogynists.\n      Also, I don't have a hate of<b>  sex</b>, because that would mean I was asexual (I'm not, most people aren't). As I did state earlier, sexualisation in video games is not what annoys me. It's a clever marketing scheme, and there is a difference between sexualisation an<b> d sexis</b>m. That being said, I don't like it in games and I'd rather be without it in them, but if you do I won't be annoyed at you, just not hugely impressed. In terms of sexuality and stuff, I don't like it being put into games and films where it's gratuitous and unecessery, but that does not mean I hate it as a whole, so that point you make is a little invalid.\n     Finally, as I stated before its the aggressive unpleasant misogynistic hating upon women who do anything that I can't stand. For example the ghostbusters trailer having the highest dislikes ever on YouTube. And that's the thing he brought up which is true in the video. It's the thing I experience every day. And it is that, along with the horrible way some men treat women, as though they are objects, that annoys me.\n   The comments on this video are nearly all negative, and this really further emphasises my point.",

I mean, you can go through the entire game without killing a single <b> woman,</b> but have to kill men, but that is true for a lot of games. It's not really GTA specifically sending a sexist message. Hell, even with that being the case, there are still people calling it sexist against women. It's really just them trying to cover their asses from the feminist mobs looking for reasons to be offended. If you are going to say it is sexist because of this guy's reasons well that is just ridiculous. They got a female model for one of the posters. That's not sexist. It's advertising. There are 3 male characters you can play. Not sexist, it's part of the storyline. Some of the women are bitches or prostitutes in the game. Not sexist, this is true in real life and there are plenty of male scumbags in the game as well.",

It's ok to use cliches. It's ok to use stereotypes. The characters don't have agency. The player does.\n\nIf you want GTA to make a female lead just say that. Not all this other nonsense.\n\nAlso almost all of the people that talk about that gamer survey use the data and only refer to triple A gaming. My mom who plays facebook games counts on that thing. That's not to say women don't play Triple A games. I am one. It's that people assume that there should be more women in GTA because everyone's mom plays Candy Crush.\n\n\u00a0I bought my mom Fall Out New Vegas. I thought maybe the easy targeting and VATS would make it easier for her to play. She didn't like it. Does that mean my mom has no games she can play? No. She has 3 different\u00a0 versions of Kinnect sports games because she likes them so much. She plays point and click games. She plays bingo and video poker.\n\nThere are far far more games out there than what E3 shows. It's like pointing at 50 Shades of Gray and asking why there are no books for boys. Take off your blinders and look at ALL games. Actually ask women what they like to play rather than assuming what they should be playing because guys play it.",

For example games of tag have been banned, boys have no special quotas in schools and so on. With the result of rhose restrictions gaming is the only option left besides sport. Boys aren't influenced by games much more than girls are, it is just an escape. Besides not all can get their hands on GTA V, and don't you think it's a bit over the top to claim that only boys are influenced by games?\nThis is why feminism can't battle <b> sexism,</b> because they blame only one<b>  gender</b>. what about teaching, nursing and cooking?\nWhy are those fields(cooking is rather balanced now but still considered a feminine job/skill) not required to have a mal<b> e gende</b>r quota. I assume that you noticed that the majority of nurses and teachers are female.\n\nThe point is, gaming  used to be a male dominated hobby and rhrough time girls got into it. But the problem arose when people didn't like the games so first they started calling people(gamers) Geeks and Nerds, followed by \"brain washed mass murderers\" and now sexists a<b> nd raci</b>st. And if you know a few gamers you will see that they can be found in different sizes and shapes, with different opinions and different lifestyles, yet they are all hanging together and having fun.\nFeminism chose the only people who would fire back at them, this is the only reason people are.making such a fuss about it, because we dared to stand up and say \"But we are not sexist<b>  or rac</b>ist, and you are not going to take away my games.\" .",

I like the Dead or Alive franchise and ignore the criticism about the sexy women because I still get to enjoy the game, and in a perfect world a <b> woman </b>could just choose something else to play if it wasn't for them.

            "commentText": "Oh look, sexist stereotyping less than one minute in (1:00)... The hypocrisy is real.\n\nI would like to see some statistics that explicitly state that women make up such a vast % of the playerbase per genre. The few surveys I have seen state vague facts like the following: \"[...] the stereotype that female gamers are interested almost exclusively in casual smartphone titles is tested by the data. 47% of female gamers polled had played a disc-based game in the last six months, and 68% had played an online game. 56% of female gamers have played on a console.\" -  [LINK] \n\nThe above quote does not disprove the stereotype. In fact it really doesn't tell us anything. Half of female gamers played a disc-based game in the last six months? That tells me <b> nothing </b>of the other 53% (which likely did not play a disc-based game at all) and six months is a huge amount of time that doesn't tell me much about the other 47%... \"An online game\" could mean a mobile game too, so that statistic is useless. 56% \" have played on a console\" is also ambiguous. How recent did they play, how often and for how long?\n\nIf women did represent such a large portion of the target demographic of a game like GTA V, the market would speak for itself. Game developers for certain genres would take it into consideration and insert more female characters. It would be naive to think that giant publishers that make games for the target audience of young males have not done their own research. They have polled, interviewed, and surveyed their asses off and they know exactly what their target demographics are.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm all for female gamers and female protagonists. But this sense of entitlement has got to stop. It reminds me of how there was some backlash some time ago of superheroes not being ethnically diverse. Michelle Rodriquez stated something along the lines of 'instead of complaining, how about make your own ethnically diverse cast of superheroes'. Invent your own characters to suit your liking instead of bashing characters that others have worked so hard to create. Stop being so entitled and be the change you want to see instead of forcing someone else to change their ideas.",

Yet I'm disgusted at some of the comments on this page.\u00a0\nOkay, people saying the guy in the video is sexist because he is discriminating against \"male gamers for the <b> gender </b>not their personalities\" - bullshit. He's angry against the gamers who disregard female-gamers. For people saying he's a troll - you are part of the problem. He is trying to say \"Lets just welcome everyone, its not a male-only club\" you're the ones saying otherwise. For those people who are discrediting what he's saying because the subject is on GTA5, then get off your fanboy horse, it is an example on something that was really popular yet showed a problem based on the reviews which pointed out flaws. There are flaws in every game. For people saying that<b>  sexism</b> is not the worst thing in the game - he was not trying to say about how it is the WORST thing in the game, it is a problem about the game.\nAnd FINALLY! For those people saying that the 47% of female gamers statistic is girls playing Candy-crush and some shit... I am a female gamer. I play Mass Effect, Drago<b> n Ag</b>e, Tomb Raider, COD, Skyrim, Dragon's Dogma, Bioshock, and games like that. NOW try and tell me that those aren't REAL games!",

Certain women just want to feel like victims, and some betas just want to give them that empty ammunition.  Female gamers aren't being ignored or disregarded. At all. Since the beginning of games, developers have been building games for both genders and sexes to enjoy.Yes, you may see some of their design choices as sexist or uninviting, but, in the end, that's how you feel. I feel differently, but so does everyone.\n\n\nIf there is so much damn <b> sexism </b>in games, then why don't all of these people complaining go and get a Comp Sci or animation degree and make their own non-sexist games? Then they wouldn't be so busy being victims. Videogames are art, just like other art. Art is subjective as hell and so are games. If someone wants to make a game as sexist as possible, let them. One could sit there and tell him how problematic the game is, but don't force him to change anything just because one may find it offensive and too evil to exist. People act like gaming is one giant, huge ass blob that has some kind of hive mind and all of these SJWs have to attack the hive, but that's not the case. Yet all these damn people think it is.",

One must be a special kind of retarded subhuman scum to not know that what is ok to do in games does not apply to reality.\n\nWe are under constant pressure under social norms and rules. Most decent people also follow these. But just once in a while they want to forget it all and \"blow out steam\". Games are there so people can rest from reality, to escape and do things that they wouldn't do in reality. After they are done they return to reality and continue as a decent member of the society. But then come these people and start to force the same shit into the games that people escaped into the games in the first place. That does not serve any reasonable purpose except wanting people to start blowing out steam in reality. For example trashing someone else's property or mistreating people around them.\nThat is fundamentaly ill.",

Was it maybe the most controversial thing you could grab a hold of for likes? \n\nSecondly, when he was talking about GTA he never said he didnt like the game. He said the 9/10 rating that girl gave it was fair. He just says it would've been a 10 if they had included strong characters with redemtion arks and good jokes that are, coincidentally, female. He talks about how the women, overall, really dont do anything in the plot other than be hookers or annoying house wives. It's not \"censorious moral panic\" (censorious, not a word btw) to state the girls dont have plot relevance, its a hard fact in the game lore. \n\nps, can you answer the question he poses near the end? Why NOT have female lead characters? You could swap someone, like idk Trevor or Franklin out (I dont think Michael would work well there, because you know wife and kids, the gamers already cant handle females in their games, let alone 'the gays'), and the story could be almost totally the same. \n\nAnd if your counter argument is \"Well if it all stays the same why would i put a girl in?\", its simple. Girls will flock to another girl in media. Representation matters, and your game sales will go up.",

I looked into it a bit, and: it's a valuable study, but it shouldn't be taken as the last word on the issue (or anywhere close to the last word). The study approaches the issue in a very broad way - it assesses respondents sexist attitudes using just three very general questions. One of the study's authors mentioned this on her blog and wrote \"...some believe that this study is evidence that <b> sexism </b>is not a problem within the gaming culture. This could not be further from the point.\" Also, the study was only conducted in Germany, so it's not clear how applicable the results are to gaming in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nThe study should definitely be part of the discussion, but it's not the end of the discussion. This is a complex issue, and there'll never be any one, single study that can cover every aspect of it.\u00a0\n\n(I'll also note that I don't think this guy's TED talk was very good - it's not <b> 'sexism</b> in gaming' so much as<b>  'sexis</b>m in GTA 5,' and he presents very little in the way of verifiable evidence. But, I do think his general points are sensible.)",

Then, we could look it up on Web of Science and see how many times it's been critiqued.\n\nThe point is moot, however. The study shows that there isn't a causal relationship from playing games to sexist attitudes. No one is arguing that anyway. If that were true of games in general, then we'd expect to see those manifest in women having those same attitudes over time. If that were true, then we would likely see so many women enter gaming and leave it shortly thereafter that the 47% figure would be far off.\n\nThe real question is whether games are sexist in their catering. Frankly, many AAA titles are. Scholars like Anita Sarkeesian have shown that in literally dozens of games within the past few years, let alone classic gems. Like the host of this video says, many game companies see the average gamer as a dude, and they craft games for that audience, complete with stereotypes and other sexist assumptions.\n\nObjectively, the host of this talk is absolutely, empirically correct.",

Maybe the difference is not so stark where you live if you live outside of the USA, but there are tons of institutional inequities here, unfortunately.

All she is, is a drama creating professoinal victim and con artist, with a history in telemarketing schemes and misappropriation of funds received through fundraising. She does no research herself, sources none of the videos she uses in her \"lectures\" and has done more to harm <b> gender </b>equality and balance in the entertainment industry then anyone in the history of the industry.

If you are being paid less than one of your co-workers who is in the same position CALL YOUR LOCAL POLICE. It has literally been illegal for 40 years. What you are looking at is the cunning use of the word \"earn\". Men and Women are paid exactly the same for the same work in the same position for the same company. if you aggregate all men vs all women, the side with more people in full time work will always have more overall pay, but I'm guessing you've already realised that obvious statement to be true.\n\n\nIf I am in a full time position as a bank teller and I have a female colleague, provided we are not allowed to negotiate for our contracted rate, we will receive the exact same pay as each other. \n\n\nIf your problem is that there isn't enough women in the higher paying positions, then you will just have to wait for the the number of women graduating college (far out numbers men) to do something with their degrees.

Unfortunately, you can't just yell \"we are victims of everything\" and have it be so, a huge issue with third wave feminism is that it is being conducted from such a ludicrous place of privilege that their complaints are rightfully dismissed. Without any proof, the movement looks like it has become a parody of it's former self.\nI have watched all of her videos, they are neither factually accurate, or educating to anyone who does 5 minutes of voluntary research after, which considering your<b>  blind</b> defence and obvious desperate need to be the victim, I'd say that you haven't done the research, instead you're happy to draw parallels to actually oppressed groups from history and declare \"A winrar is me!\"\n\n\nUnfortunately it doesn't work like that, and childish things like \"/micdrop\" only go towards the notion that you don't have any interest or knowledge in the topic at hand and you're just trolling, which is unfortunate as it's exactly that kind of behaviour which damages the reputation of the feminist movement .\n\n\nThough please tell me what this \"losing position that encompasses a smaller and smaller minority\" is..",

How about we don't talk about \"you are a sexist\" but about \"I don't feel recognized the way you seem to treat people around you\". Let's make it something personal. So everyone is involved.\n\nBut far apart from that topic, I strive to be a huge games developer one day. I study to become one one day. Guess what I will create as soon as I can. Correct.

I don't ever think about genders when creating a game. I think about what is in my head and what I want to share with the world. If that is a sexist joke, well, it's probably because I was born and raised that way. And if YOU have a PROBLEM with MY JOKES, come RIGHT AT ME and TELL ME about it. I would love to have some responses. So if YOU can convince me that my behaviour is wrong, and I DO listen to reason, I WILL change it. As far as I am able to.\nI think that is the only important thing we will ever have in the whole sexism-debate.

Very flawed. She (as well as many other feminists) conflate capitalism with <b> sexism.</b> What I mean by that is, game manufacturers make male-centered games because they are catering to their predominantly male audience, not because they're sexist. She also always targets games that are specifically made for a male audience and never (rarely) games that aren't. If she would take a little effort to look past the most popular titles (Batman, Mortal Kombat), she would find a huge world of games that aren't sexist in any way (Limbo, Portal, and many many many more). And even many big titles aren't sexist, like Smash.\n\nAnd then there's that scandal where Anita raised a lot of money and didn't put it to use...\n\nSo forgive me, but in my eyes, she is the con artist, not Thunderf00t. Thunderf00t is just a moron on youtube. Sarkeesian is trying to make it in the real world, so she needs to be more professional, reliable and factual than Thunderf00t, since her actions have direct influences on many more people than Thunderf00t's actions (Twitter, the UN, fundraisers, ...). All Thunderf00t does is rant to 680k people on youtube for ad revenue.\n\nBy the way, I personally don't think that hot girls in a videogame is necessarily sexist, as long as they're not being objectified. And even if they're being objectified, sometimes this serves the storyline and is therefore excusable.\nIt's curious how the reverse is never criticised by feminists; when a man is being tortured, when a man is killed, objectified, abused, ... And feminists also never seem to mind the impossible beauty 'standard' that's being set for men. The difference, I think, is that women get jealous or envious of a game character, while men don't, which is hilarious if that were true.\n\nNevertheless, you're dellusional or trolling.",

It is only in one case though, if you use a figure of speech, called elipsis, and skip out on the word \"person\" which is always implied if you make a certain adjective, especially used for groups, a noun.\nWe could call this process a transnoun, if it hadn't already have a name.

Also, it is possible for people to care about more than one issue at a time.",

How he executes qnd addresses his concerns are distractingly through memes normally reserved for facebook comments.  His tone is very condescending as he points out he agreed with some heavily opinionated claims blogs/articles \"100%.\"  To claim is to present a case before presenting facts.  As of now his claim doesn't hold much water is its just purely based on how feels.  If cherry picking titles without empasizing other genres and protagonists , is his intent to limit creativity and innovations to a degree whether he knows it or not?",

            "commentText": "This gave me such a headache. So factually shallow. You skip over all the key information like, what does it mean to be a gamer? You say 47% but can consider someone who played pokemon 6 years ago and not a game since a gamer? Or maybe someone who plays games like COD, Sims, Starcraft, WoW and League, but only once or twice a year? No you can't. At least I don't believe you can. What defines this 47% statistic?\u00a0\nAlso you can't use a few comments from the internet and then group gamers together as women hating basement dwellers. As for the points about video games as art. You do not judge a \"thing\" whether it is art, based on the people who don't partake in the creation of said \"thing\". Talk to \"Developer\" and \"Game ARTISTS\" about what goes into making a game. Then formulate you're own opinion on whether a game is art or not.",

The scientific studies don't contradict each other all too much, but the way they're interpreted depends vastly on the political agenda of who's presenting them.

I don't study economy, but if I tried to sell a product I would not supply something no one seems to want, but listen to the voices instead.\nTo use the cookie analogy again: Some people just don't like Oatmeal ones, and it is both unreasonable and missed economical potential to not sell cookies to those who are outright asking for them. Others do buy oatmeal ones but are also like \"Hey, if they sold Chocolate Chips too, I would totally buy them instead\". You can actually like cookies but not like oatmeal. What's wrong with preferring Chocolate ones (or maybe even both, which I would consider to be closest to alltsem's type)?\nAs a side note, are you saying that you wouldn't touch cookies with Chocolate Chips?\n\nThe newest Tomb Raider (reviewers rate 85% in average, 1 million copies sold in two days after the release, reached 1st place in 2013, second only to Grand Theft Auto V in this year) totally was a disaster, like, what were they thinking, trying to sell an ideologically tainted product?\nAs a side note, are you saying that it's political and ideologically tainted to ask for and then even pay money for those games?\n\nWhat you were basically saying is that games are only fun if they have no connection with reality.\nYou are opposing someone who says that no, games actually do have a connection with reality, and yes, that can be great fun.\nAs someone who is be a very happy person when I introduce people to some source of wonderment or fun they missed out on in their lives before, I think you are missing important parts of a greater picture.\nGames are considered a form of art by now, garnering the interest of mainstream media rethinking their notion that all gamers are unsociable at best and potential berserk runners at worst, of scholars asking the big How and Why behind the spread and appeal of games, of sponsors promoting games as a form of sportsmanship by financially supporting the huge eSports communities we now have, of artistically adept people investing their abilities not to create sculptures and classical compositions, but photorealistic terrain, models and OSTs.\n\nSomething about this should tip you off that gaming, as it evolved until today, is a bit more than the appeal you find in them, if the gameplay of GTA V is all that appeals to you.\nIf you were so kind to tell me what the media, the scholars, the sponsors, and the artists have to say about GTA being a work of art, that would be nice.\nOh, and, as a side note, I really don't know what else to ask of you, apart from that you maybe enjoy your Oatmeal cookies while others ardently invest their savings into Chocolate Chips, which both sell great, obviously, and neither of you (plural 'you' used here) have to fear scarcity because there will be enough cookie dough for all of us.\n\nThings which I would link to imply that AAA can be downright political, something which would never be dared if it wasn't for <b> transgender </b>raccoons:\n [LINK] \n [LINK] \n [LINK] \nYes, I do think there is more to those games than just shooting people, in fact that's what I am saying with referring to them in the first place.",

The pressing matter would then be to decide what is ideologically warped and what is more... in line with how reality and society actually works and looks like.\nHowever, nowhere did I read here that games without correct representation of reality have to be purged. And I doubt that will happen for as long as your children's children will live.\n\nThe demand for games you can enjoy without feeling aroused to think about those matters will remain for a long time. And that's okay. I highly doubt that GTA V turned out the way it did Rockstar North wants you to think of women as failed and inferior beings. You may believe there is some attempt of satire, you may believe that it's meant to be just a game, for the sheer sake of enjoyment. Again, that is okay.\n\nOne might find the SAW series unappealing, but it's a matter of fact that there is this very real thing called eustress you may experience when watching scary or suspenseful movies. This is kind of proof you can feel \"good\" from them, as pointless as they might be to think about as more than just entertainment. Let's be a bit unfair and say that games for the simple sake of enjoyment are (if we are being overly superstitious and forget that there is always some kind of message you may see, or some part of the aesthetics you may appreciate or not) at the very least not worse than this.\n\nIt's an issue if people really think that this is how reality looks like, or is supposed to look like, and then deduct from CODBLOPS that the USA never did anything questionable during the 60s, or that life is only really rich if you were assigned the right<b>  gender</b>. Not saying that anyone in here does believe so.\n\nThe reason why people criticis<b> e sexis</b>m in games is that if a game designer didn't care about what kind of world a they build in their game, there has to be a reason this kind of content ended up in there. I might be planting an epileptic tree here, but maybe your subconscious decisions are equally, if not more telling of how you think of something than the conscious ones. Unless you think that men and women are treated according to the<b> ir gend</b>er exactly as they deserve in your society, there might be some reason for you to ponder, very generally speaking, how this world can be made better, or at least good enough for you to be satisfied.\nBut again, starting a discussion ab<b> out gen</b>der equality is not my agenda.",

Just because we play games doesn't mean we want to fuck you, and not wanting to doesn't make us nut-crunching harpies. I take critique/jokes about my gaming ability as well as anyone; that's not the issue in the least. I'd love to go back into online gaming, as I met a few small groups of awesome people but they ended up fading off and then there wasn't any decent people to join up with after. But I don't go back because of that issue and the constant harassment and consistent (as well as almost always extremely explicit) stream of rape threats whenever it's discovered that I am actually a female. It also doesn't help that the industry is still relying on little else beyond the<b>  sex</b> appeal of 3D women; I'd like to be able to play a female character that doesn't wear bikini strings for armor. Is that really so much to give up?\n\nTake Lilianna from Drago<b> n Ag</b>e for example: appropriately dressed (except, perhaps a tiiiiny bit too much cleavage in the DA:O session, but that was the case for female armor sets in general), capable, intelligent/crafty, with a well-scripted dialogue as well as backstory and still has a hint of playful sexuality (which many women have but, contrary to popular belief, don't use it just to give guys they meet blue balls 'cause they tease but won't put out).

No, the idea is to make the place better for everyone to just have a good time playing and only have to sweat the jackasses/griefers/trolls temporarily. Just because society tells guys to 'deal with it' doesn't mean you fucking should.\n\nWhat they're saying to other men, however, is not the same. We all know that one gamer threatening to kill another is 99.999999...% never going to happen-- it's so ridiculous that it's just become a major annoyance rather than a true threat.\n\nIs it really so much to ask them for the OPTION to NOT have them wear the completely useless skimpy armor? It is perhaps a handful more textures, but that's a small concession to make to open up the game to 47% more of the audience that could theoretically get to buy the game.\n\nThe women that get pissed off for you just LOOKING at them are very sensitive, and that's something I wouldn't defend. Sure, fine, get nervous about it-- but to run to the defense of, \"it's objectifying me!\" ... no. That is one of the few things that guys insist are compliments that I typically agree are indeed simply silent compliments.\nWhat's objectifying is when you pass a guy and they then turn to their buddy and say, \"look at the tits on THAT!\"; when a guy that just asked you for directions and you helped him out reaches out and manhandles your breasts from his car just because he can; when female models are constantly broken down into their 'meaningful parts' (mouth, ass, tits, vagina) instead of viewed as a whole person like the 99.9999....% of male models are; when you can't get a job that you're overqualified for because either a prettier, less qualified <b> woman </b>applied as well or a male with appropriate qualifications applied; oh, and when you are immediately considered inferior in things that are traditionally male (gaming, gambling, racing, martial arts, science, mathematics, etc) or incessantly mocked for not being perfect at or at least competent at things that are traditionally female (mothering, cooking, cleaning, serving, proper manners, etc) simply based on one chromosome. I know that you'll take the last one and insist that men are treated the same-- yeah, sure. They'll rag on you about not being able to do something, but it doesn't end up DEFINING you. If you're a<b>  woman</b> and you can't cook, for example, or doesn't like children, that's something people will almost certainly bring up when INTRODUCING you to someone else or simply when bringing you up in a conversation when you're not there. It turns you into a horrible person; it just turns a man into a work in progress.",

They leave.\nSeriously, there are so many fucking games on the market and ways in which to make your own or to mod them in order to achieve your \"ideal\" game. Quit bitching that AAA game developers have a vision for their ART (as we're classifying it) that doesn't happen to fit your ridiculous checklist of quotas. I promise you there are games out there that have exactly what you're looking for, go buy those and enjoy yourself.",

Please direct me to where I \"shit on\" other games? Not once did I complain or attack other games.

There is no negativity in my comment at all. \u00a0\n\nAnd yes I want to create video games, but even if I didn't I'd still say the same thing. \u00a0it's ok to request diversity without wanting to create the games. With your logic, you shouldn't critique movies or books unless you're willing to make one yourself. Asking for more racially inclusive media is not attacking anyone, not asking for less white people, and not insulting white people in any way.\n\nWanting more people of color in films/games/etc is not about <b> racism,</b> but<b>  racism</b> will continue to exist if people continue to get uncomfortable wheneve<b> r rac</b>e is brought up.

Well, how relevant is that point when considering the major scope of video games. In almost every video game about more than 80% (at least) of video game enemies are men. We don't really care about any agency then. Think about how many soldiers you kill in COD, MGS, Splinter Cell, GTA 5 even, TLOU etc. Those men have no agency but we can kill, behead, shoot them them in the balls and it's good humor. Imagine putting a <b> woman </b>in that role. It would be unacceptable. Especially in Tomb Raider where Lara kills multiple men who are just looking to survive. Or in TLOU where Ellie does the same.\n\nI wonder what critics have to say to that, as I wonder if women will ever be ready to inhabit disposable roles in video games the way men currently are and will continue to for time to come.",

That's why enemies are males. Because you can kill, maim, shoot, behead or punch a man and it won't be seen as hostile or wrong or controversial. Throw one <b> woman </b>under the same category and people go<b>  crazy</b>. Men are disposable in culture and this is just an appropriation of that disposabiity in play. Even Tomb Raider featured that same trope. <b> A woma</b>n goes around killing only men. So don't go around assuming that it h<b> as nothi</b>ng to do with them being men because there is a lot with them being men.\nPeople want to have their cake and eat it too. They want strong women <b> and colo</b>red characters but they want these characters to be free of violence and stuff. Sorry, but that just cannot happen. When you are in the world of the game, every character follows the same rules as the world, meaning expect any of the above to take place.\nMale sexualisation also takes place in video games. You don't think that there are so many shirtless, ripped, bare-chested, six-packed men in video games? Irrespective of the purpose of the character design, it still fulfills the same phenomenon of sexualisation. That's the thing with media. People want to see idealistic representations of character designs. That's why there is so much focus on actors and actresses looking a certain way or being a certain way because that is an integral part of media to have that idealistic representation propagate.\nIf you want to talk about JRPGs and their depictions of women, then you have to understand the audience they are primarily catering to. Their main audience is Japanese and East Asian and in those cultures (especially Japanese) female sexuality is celebrated instead of being shunned or tabooed the way we do it elsewhere. They celebrate the female form and<b>  the se</b>xual portrayals of femininity and hence the depictions of sexuality go far b<b> eyond s</b>exual satisfaction for male gamers. The fact that they are sold in the Western world is a privilege we enjoy to get a chance to play such games but for comparison's sake, you can't put JRPGs in the same category as other gam<b> es and </b>sexual portrayals.. On that note, why <b> can't </b>a woman's s sexuality be empowering instead of being shameful? Do we need to continue to propagate that me<b> ntality</b>?\nSexism goes both ways, because when there is prejudice against one, there is prejudice against the other too. The prejudice can be positive or negative but it is a prejudice <b> and hen</b>ce sexi<b> sm. Wh</b>en a woman's sexuality is suppressed and a man's isn't it means that men and women are not seen as equals. When a man is killed conveni<b> ently </b>and a woman is saved for political reasons, it means that we value the lives of women more than men. I'm not saying that we should no<b> t talk </b>about sexism but l<b> et's no</b>t make sexism a gendered issue as it goes both ways, and in this talk, the speaker just does not go to address it. If he wanted to speak<b>  about </b>rampant sexism in gaming, then he should have also talked about how the lives of women are more valuable than those of men which is why it's less controversial when a man gets killed <b> as opp</b>osed to a woman getting killed.",

I think the problem could be solved if they catered equally to women gamers and included equal numbers of male and female characters in games (note I say characters and I mean it in a literary sense). I don't know of any feminist lobbying for women characters to not get equal portrayals as men in video games. That is EXACTLY what they want. If a solid, round, unstereotypical female character were to die as part of the plot of a video game no feminist would have a problem with that. At all. It's killing female prostitutes, who are portrayed little more than background objects, for example, that people have a problem with (made worse by the fact that many men do kill prostitutes in real life). Also, you mentioned physique and sexuality as the same thing: it's not. A ripped man is not a <b> sexual </b>object; a women with no personality, with a ridiculously sized chest hanging out, and having her make sexually suggestive comments every 5 minutes, is. When male characters have their bulging penises in everyone's faces, hitting on everyone (including other men), and having that as his WHOLE character, then we can talk (and have at least two of these hyper<b> -sexual</b<b> > se</b>x objects in EVERY single game of every single genre). And don't even get me started on the media.\nI understand Asian, specifically Japanese, culture; you don't have to explain, or attempt to justify, the<b> ir sexi</b>sm. It<b>  IS sex</b>ism; tradition (and culture as part of that) does not change or excuse that fact. I have no problem with female sexuality, or any sexuality for that matter; I would just like to see sexuality as PART of a character and not as a character itself, for it to be portrayed realistically, and to see it equally in men, or not at all. Portrayal of sexuality NEEDS to come with respect, and currently it does not in any video game I've ever seen. Art is a beautiful way of portraying sexuality in all sexes and genders; for example, artists and sculptors of ancient Rome and France, respected and even revered their subjects and portrayed them beautifully. Until video game developers can do the same with their subjects and audience, it cannot be respected as an art form.\u00a0\nAnd no, just because one side is prejudice it doesn't mean the other is too, though it may seem like that to defensive, privileged parties. Most feminists do not hate men or wish to see them treated the same way women are. They want everyone to be on an equal playing ground, in every regard.",

Or even how feminists like Anita Sarkeesian cherry-picks and misrepresents violence in video games to fit her \"<b> misogyny\"</b> narrative propaganda. There are way too many feminists like that and until you have compromises taking place, you won't see any change in the phenomenon. Equality is a double-edged sword and feminists only seem to want to hold the handle end and not the blade end and until they are ready to do just that, there isn't going to be any more pandering continuing in video games. If you want feminists to represent women's voice in the gaming sphere, then you might as well give up on dreams of benevolent representations. There's no end to their politically correct whining.\n\"\u00a0If a solid, round, unstereotypical female character were to die as part of the plot of a video game no feminist would have a problem with that.\"\nThere is no end to how solid, how round or how unstereotypical of a female character is enough. There just isn't in the eyes of feminists. It's more of a whinefest of entitlement than anything more for feminists gamers like these. They're just as bad as the gamers who cry about resolution or frame rate in video games. They don't deserve a higher pedestal just because they self-proclaim themselves to align with a movement that is seen as fashionable in today's<b>  age</b>. See Jade Aldemir and Anita Sarkeesian's problem with that character for reference if you want to know what I'm talking about.\n\n\"A ripped man is not <b> a sexua</b>l object; a women with no personality, with a ridiculously sized chest hanging out, and having her make sexually suggestive comments every 5 minutes, is.\"\nWhat?! Is that the whole \"ripped men are a male power fantasy\" excuse? Where in video games do you see women exposing breasts and nipples and vaginas? Why would you compare a semi-cl<b> ad wom</b>an to a man exposing his penis? Again, why can'<b> t a wo</b>man's sexuality be empowering f<b> or a w</b>oman AND satisfying for the male fantasy at the same time? Why do we have to choose between one or the other?\n\n\"I understand Asian, specifically Japanese, culture; you don't have to explain, or attempt to justify, <b> their s</b>exism.<b>  It IS </b>sexism; tradition (and culture as part of that) does not change or excuse that fact.\"\nIt is ben<b> evolent</b> sexism. It is a part of culture but it is also celebrated tha<b> t way.</b> A woman in that sort of typical femme sexualisation is actually empowering to Japanese femininity while it may not be seen as empowering to Western femininity. The East works completely different to the west in terms of what they see as degrading and what they see as celebratory, hence it's best to keep Japanese games out of this discussion as we obviously aren't able to see it in the same lens as they intend to portray it in. That's one of the reasons why feminism isn't really catching on in Japan. Sexualisation is a power and not an objectifiable quality. The women don't need liberation or upliftment in such cases because they just don't see it as a bad thing like we do. You see a problem with focusing on someone's sexuality? They see it as empowering. No need to force anyone's opinion on one another, but we're obviously talking about 2 different perspectives here so it's best left out of the discussion.\n\n\"And no, just because one side is prejudice it doesn't mean the other is too, though it may seem like that to defensive, privileged parties. \"\nIt seems like you're unnecessarily trying to shoehorn privilege into this sphere. I clearly stated that prejudice goes both ways by giving the example of violence against men and violence against women in video games. When you prejudice positively or negatively, the other party is also affected by the prejudice either positively or nega<b> tively</b>. A woman does not have to fear as much that she will be graphically tortured or disposed the way a man might be portrayed as.\nWhy? Feminists themselves talk<b>  about </b>how sexism against women affect men too by showing how prejudice against one, means a different prejudice against the other.\n\n\n\"Art is a beautiful way of portraying sexuality in all sexes and genders; for example, artists and sculptors of ancient Rome and France, respected and even revered their subjects and portrayed them beautifully.\"\nArt is subjective. So is perception. Many parties criticise Renaissance nude art because they believe it is just an excuse to displ<b> ay tit</b>s and pussy and dick when it is generally shunned by public. I disagree but that's my opinion. That's the thing about art. Someone might notice something and someone else might notice something else. We can't assert that what we see is what everyone else should see. Although I grew up in a culture where sexuality was a taboo, I personally always celebrated sexuality and its portrayals (no matter if people thought they were cheap or beautiful). I stopped seeing sexuality as a taboo or as something cheap and I celebrate any portrayal of it-be it porn or be it Renaissance painting.\nBut simply put, vote with your wallet. You see something you don't like? You vote that you don't like it. If there are enough people who think like you, you'll start seeing change taking place. Businesses pander to the majority of the market. If you truly believe that the market is changing, then businesses will change their practices too.",

I believe we should stop blaming media for biased portrayals of something and instead educate people to understand the nuances, stereotypes and reality of things. I generally am able to place a divide between media and real life appropriation because I understand that media might skew some things to tell a certain story or to present a certain \"romanticized\" or \"unromanticied\" view of the world. If I really have to make a judgment about the world, using the media is just a poor way to start.\nIf people are self-conscious, I believe that's the first step in \"breaking media's influence\". But anyways, for anything, I would hold people responsible for appropriating media messages instead of blaming the media for \"teaching people something\" when it doesn't seek to do that.",

That's one way of getting more women into video games. Why don't people fight for that kind of representation? I'd like to see a video game exist where it's just as ok for a man to go around killing women as it is ok for a <b> woman </b>to go around killing a man (Tomb Raider).\n\nYou say that men are the default, hence they are made to inhabit these roles. I say, bring women in and make them inhabit these roles so that we can have more women in games. Pray tell me why is it ok for games to have female protagonists (Samus Aran, Jade, Lara Croft) yet still have male enemies? Why the issue there? I can bet that if a video game were to be made like TOmb Raider only with a<b>  gender</b> swap, then people would shout and cr<b> y misogyn</b>y. There is a reason why disposable roles are inhabited by men and especially white men. Because you can do any of the things I listed above to white men without questions <b> of raci</b>sm <b> and sex</b>ism being brought up. If you want to make claim<b> s of se</b>xism against women in video games then I'd like to see women share the same disposable roles that men have in video games. You can't pick and choose what and how you want women to be represented as in video games.\n\nWe've seen examples of games with strong female protagonists. I'd like to see games with weak disposable, killable female enemy objects. I'd like to see games with weak disposable killable POC enemies. Once these kinds of representations are considered normal, we can say that the claims that people make <b> about s</b>exi<b> sm and </b>racism in video games are not one-sided and hypocritical.\n\nAn<b> d it is</b> sexism. Tell you why? Because men are made to inhabit these roles BECAUSE THEY ARE MEN. Had they been women, they'd not be in those roles but developers would be ok with putting women in protagonistic roles like Lara Croft or deuteragonistic roles like Alyx Vance as long as the things they are killing are not t<b> heir ow</b>n gender but disposable men. Men are discriminated because<b>  of the</b>ir gender. To say that<b>  it is </b>not sexism because men discriminate against men is like sa<b> ying t</b>hat a woman being chauvinistic aga<b> inst</b> her own sex is not sexist. It's asinine<b> . If yo</b>u want sexism to not exist, <b> you nee</b<b> >d to </b>be gender blind. Ergo, I'd like to see a game where I can play as a male character and where the enemies who can be killed, dismembered or maimed are women.\n\nI'd like to see the next Sniper Elite game to have ovary shots.\n\nI'd like the next Uncharted to have an all-female enemy set. No male enemies fighting Nathan Drake. Why do all the henchmen have to be male?\n\nI'd like to see the next Tomb Raider have Lara Croft fighting just female enemies.\n\nI'd like to see Emily Kaldwin and Corvo Attano fight female only guards in the next Dishonored. Dishonored the original game only had male guards.\n\nBecause when a developer makes their enemy character set all male fo<b> r so ma</b>ny years, nobody bats an eye. But when a developer makes a protagonist set a male for so many years, people cry about under-representation of <b> women. </b<b> >If yo</b>u are gender-blind, you should have no problem with a man running around killing women only, just like how people had no problem and did not whine <b> about </b>Lara \u00a0Croft-a woman- going around killing only men in the Tomb Raider game.",

That right there is supporting the idea that men are the default, the standard, the basic, the preferred. The fact is, you won't find an all-female cast because they rarely exist in reality. In Dishonored, the game only had male guards because only men were enlisted for military or policing occupations in the era in which the game is meant to be set, and this is true for a lot of games based on reality.\n\n\nI don't cry at a male protagonist. What is bothersome is the way women are represented in MOST video games. The fact that you said this:\n\n\n\"I'd like to see a video game exist where it's just as ok for a man to go around killing women as it is ok for <b> a woma</b>n to go around killing a man\"\n\n\n...shows me that you are either horrifyingly ignorant or are trying to formulate some kind of backlash to a threat that simply isn't there. Like...have you EVER played GTA? How many games are there where the majority of female characters are whores? How many games are out there where the women are always decked out in thongs and bikini bras even when fighting in the same combat style as men? They are looked at and used differently. What would be nice to see is equal footing when judging the value of a character.  That's all. I don't think that is an extreme request, considering that the gaming population is nearly split down the middle between the genders, and I don't know why you insist on arguing something that could be easily fixed. Women no longer exist just to complement a man. It is time to stop treating them like it.",

Not the ones that matter.\nAmanda is Michael's wife who is in an unhappy marriage.\nTracey is a teenager who wants to live a wild life.\nTani<b> sha is</b> a woman fed up with Franklin's gangbanging.\nMolly is a snide secretary to a rich, hedonistic millionaire.\nDebra is <b> a work</b>ing woman with a career.\n\nMichael is a criminal who kills people.\nFranklin and Lamar are gangbangers.\nTrevor is a psychopath who killed an innocent biker because he called him a motherfucker.\nJimmy is a gamer nerd who is a potty mouth online.\n\nLastly, the entire setting is a satire and parody of a living breathing world. The male AND female characters are all laughable. You taking GTA as a benchmark for representation of men and women is redundant because it's a comedy meant to humor, not to look at with a political lens.\n\nThe women you see as whores in here are just as disposable as the men who are henchmen. Saying that the women characters are whores is laughable because the men are mere target practice.\n\n\n\n\"How many games are out there where the women are always decked out in thongs and bikini bras even when fighting in the same combat style as men?\"\nNames please.\nI assume you're talking about RPGs.\nWell, here's a something that you might find shocking. I have a couple of gamer friends who are women who LOVE dressing in skimpy armor and fighting in RPGs. Many women themselves love doing this because in the words of my friends \"they wouldn't dare to wear something like that in real life and fight like that\". You see, even if you take the male gaze out of the equation, many women will demand that they want skimpy armor to be in games because they love it. Your <b> opinion</b> on sexism is not reflective on female population as a whole and is definitely not shared with everyone who is female.\nIn RPGs I dress up my character shirtless beacuse it's a fantasy. I also play as white<b>  peopl</b>e and black people because I can't do that in real life.\nIf you're talking about JRPGs then forget about it. Japan has already freed the nipple in their culture. They don't demonise female sexuality like Westerners do. To them, female sexuality is empowering whether it be from a male gaze or a female gaze.\n\n\"That's all. I don't think that is an extreme request, considering that the gaming population is nearly split down the middle between the genders,\"\nSplit down the middle but with respect to what video games? I doubt as many women play games like Dark Souls, GTA, Metal Gear Solid etc. as men do. I'd like to see evidence on how many women are gamers and what games do they play.\n\n\"and I don't know why you insist on arguing something that could be easily fixed.\"\nWhere have I argued against women being represented in different ways? If you look at my original comment, you'll see that my main concern was that in a d<b> iscussi</b>on of sexism, men are not in the picture. Men are placed in criminal roles and disposable targets to beat in games. Just because men make up protagonists does not mean that placing them as criminals is not sexist since women are criminals too. Furtehrmore, I elaborated on the speaker's point about agency. I've never stated that women should NOT be allowed to have any other roles supplementary to what they have been given. I'd like to see women as criminals too.\nIf Lara Croft can go around killing men, I'd like to see Nathan Drake going around killing women. To say that these two things are different is sexist because you're treating the same scenarios differently due to <b> the </b>change in sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you load up a new game, do you sigh at the <b> fact th</b>at your gender isn't available to play?\"\nNo. Because I don't <b> care ab</b>out what gender my character is. It's why I enjoyed Portal just as much as Half-Life, why I enjoyed Beyond Good and Evil just as much as Prince of Persia. It's why I enjoyed Thief and Thief 2 as much as Thief2x. I don't<b>  care a</b>bout what gender I'm playing. Never cared. Video games could have had all female protagonists for all I care, I still wouldn't care at all. It's the character, gameplay, setting and experience that matter. Not whether the imaginary person on the screen has breasts or not.\n\n\"do you roll your eyes at the fact that she can only wear skimpy and outrageous clothing compared to everyone else?\"\nOutrageous for you, not for everyone else. It's your problem not everyone'<b> s probl</b>em in your gender. I won't be surprised if the ones complaining about skimpy armor are the vocal minority of women and skimpy armor is only present in some games, not all games. Maybe you should play more games that very well give you the CHOICE to dress up your character the way you want. Play the way you want and others can play the way they want. What games have you been playing? I'd like to know.\n\n\"Despite the fact that such inferiority doesn't or shouldn't exist anymore, do you find yourself pissed off at the fact that people seem to hate the idea of standing up for yourse<b> lf beca</b>use of your gender?\"\nStand up for<b>  yourse</b>lf, not your gender. Don't dictate what people should find offensive or not. You're tired of seeing some things in video games-how is that any different than a console gamer tired of seeing 1080p on his console<b>  on all</b> video games? Gender debates and politics like these are fruitless and no more credible than resolution and frame rate debates and PC vs console debates. They're all trying to fight for something that is a non-issue. I'm not ok wi<b> th men </b>being the only gender to be henchmen, criminals and gangbangers. I don't whine about it. I only brouht this topic up because this video existed.\nIt's like a man crying that movies and products like Barbie always show men as prizes that women seek and that women are attracted to them because of the<b> ir prin</b>cely charms and gender, not because of their personality. It's asinine to relate this t<b> o somet</b>hing as grave as gender equality.\n\n\n\n\"Even if I were t<b> o agree</b> with you at male sexism in video games, it's just not relevant enough\"\nAnd I guess that the existence of a greater problem negates the existence of a comparatively lesser problem? It does not. Both are non-is<b> sues. T</b>his video is about sexism in gaming. And not a single second of this<b>  video </b>is spent mentioning sexism against men in gaming that is rampant because while there have been women protagonists and fleshed out women characters, there still haven't been henchwomen, women for target practice and disposable women. It's a biased one-sided vi<b> ew of</b> a TED talk.\n\n\"There's zero reason for you to be getting all up in arms <b> over wh</b>at you perceive to be sexism because it doesn't permeate into reality.\"\nDisagreed.\nMen are m<b> ore lik</b>ely to get profiled as sexual predators.\nMen are more likely to be profiled as criminals\nMen are more likely to face harsher sentencing for crimes.\nMen are more likely to be left behind while women and children go first. (disposable male).\nMen are more likely to face harsher street violence because there is little aid for a man facing violence.\nAnd this is assuming that what happens in video games actually permeates into reality. We have no evidence of that, so we cannot make claims about permeating into reality.\n\n\"Over the entire existence of our species on this planet, men have had the upper hand.\"\nWell that's relative.\nDo you consider dying in wars and suffering PTSD a privilege?\nDo you consider forceful military service and bearing arms in times of crisis a privilege?\nDo you consider false accusations made by women a privilege?\nDo you consider female-on-male rape being classified as \"lucky guy\" and \"women cannot rape men\" as privileges?\nBecause privilege is relative. Men and women have had it hard at different instances in different times.\nAnd btw, how does historical oppression relate to current times? You haven't faced any of the horrors women faced years ago, so why are you banking on oppression to jus<b> tify yo</b>ur voice and opinion on sexism as something deeming more important?\n\n\"When one looks at a man, one sees his capabilities, flaws, talents, skills, and<b>  demea</b>nour. When one loo<b> ks at </b>a wo<b> man, one</b> tends to see \"woman\" and nothing else.\"\nThat's completely relative. Nowadays in developing, many women are involved in the development process too. Women are CEOs of game companies too, and they certainly look at things in their way.\n\n\"'m not sure why you're arguing someone's request for dignity and humanity.\"\nI'm not. You took my point about women being criminals and target practice in games as a hostile attack against having women inhabit any roles in video games besides a box. You unwillingly strawmanned me. Look back at the thread and you'll see the folly.",

The soldiers in COD... Even the ones in the campaign you kill in large numbers are active agents.  They shoot back and have objectives themselves and have a chance of winning as evidenced by how many times you have to start a mission over.  They're ai players on the opposite team.  Often women in games are not active agents in the opposite team, in the case of GTA they're basically power ups similar to vending machines.  To give a classic and simple example, in Donkey Kong a barrel can decide whether to go down a ladder or not... It has more agency than the lady at the top.  She's not a player in the game between Jumpman and Kong, she's more like the ball.",

                    "commentText": "+qsqua please do me a favor and prove that shit? Because every bethesda game ever, the <b> old </b>falloutgames had a lot of female enemies, raiders you could gibb wonderfully. \nAnd<b>  Nobody</b> cries or bats an eye because 1. you can choose to play as female character, so we have a female character that has agency and all. 2. there are other female characters that are as well or as badly rounded as the male ones. Therefor-no problems.\n\n\nI dont know anybody who has a problem with female enemies As PRINCIPLE.. There are people who criticize violent as a way of problem solving in games and look at it under that point (and use it like for example when looking at army and forced service they say that its generally wrong to force people to do army-duty and it doesnt become better if you force women too (which isnt my opinion btw.. I am against forced service but when you force one, you should force all and give ppl the right to opt out based on ethical concerns(so they can do social services for example)\n\n\nso, like anita seems to be very pacifist in the way that she criticizes videogames that are very vioent. Thats an opinion thats legitimate to have, you dont have to share it, I dont (I.Love.Fallout...And it has the reason that i bought the austrian version and not the censored german one^^)\n\n\nsoo. Thats one person that doesnt say-okay its wrong to use womenas cannonfodder too but says- usng people as cannonfodder is not cool.(ingame)\n\n\nBut I am really really sure you wont find a feminist whos into FPS or just likes all kinds of games that will say: ah dont take female enemies...\n\n\n\n\nLike the MGS- one had female bosses that got criticized because they are sexualized and creepy(and you can oogle a female characer after she got tortured..ah soo mature) or that some female enemies sound like the\ncome when they get hit and not like..well in pain.\n\n\n\n\nI\u00b4d love more female enemies who are cool and cool villains who get their villain-ness NOT from their fucking sexuality and who wear reasonable clothes.. Because a lot of female villains in games and in media in general are such hyper-sexual people...(which then leads to the question why the fuck do we see sexuality as this dark and bad and perverse thing and use it to accentuate the depravity-female villains control and manipulate wit<b> h se</b>x (a stuff a lot of female streamers and..well in general well known women get thrown at them) and the male villains rape..\nas if there wasnt other possibilities to show a bad character.. =_=\n\n\n(I remember, like unreal tournament 03 had the possibility to play as female character. Fighting games had always female characters in them-who usually have physically impossible clothing and must suffer from kind of steel back looking at the size of their tits..(but well, looking at what those charas survive..maybe they have the wolverine gene)\n\n\nI know that you could kill children in Fallout 2-and that this was censored out here in germany. But  you could kill female enemies.. Amd as I said.. Look at the newer fallouts, or look at morrowind, oblivion, skyrim. Tons of female raiders, female enemies, female vampires, huscarls, etc etc etc<b> .. Nobo</b>dy bats an eye.\n\n\nSo Like, when they do a new far cry or a new tomb raider and just put in female enemies, a few models and just, well let them act like every normal male enemy ever, I am s<b> ure nob</b>ody will bat an eye..\n\n\n\n\nbecause I read that shit all the time, the imaginary straw feminists who is against female enemies-no thats BS.. Its the sexist notion that women are too delicate and nice to fight. (which is wrong. Women have fought all the time. They were pirates, shield maidens. Not in the number of men, thats known, but they have existed...)\nSo, just put the in. Rockstar should give  female player character (because there were a lot of female monsters out there.. Look at narcos, there were a few names, or female nazis who worked at ravensbr\u00fcck or auschwitz in the womens camp...Women can be or become sociopathic people or even like violence (btw- there are interresting books-by feminist historians that work about female nazis who worked at KZ, had part at torture or other women who were in the party and who had fun watching other people shoot jews(or even didi it themselves..) really interresting literature but I think only in german..\n\n\nso, yeah, Its possible",

There are numerous strong female characters throughout the series, and you can choose to be a female in multiplayer any time you want. Cortana is ever-present as as co-tagonist throughout all the games with Master Chief. In Reach you can even play a female in campaign. Also it is impossible to kill female npc's like Keyes, she is immune to damage. But you can readily kill any male npc. If anything Halo gives female characters special treatment.\n\n\"<b> Old </b>Games\" is hardly a solid argument either. Female characters were more rare but hardly nonexistant, and they have only become more<b>  common</b> through the years. Peach herself has been playable in numerous games, including the last three super smash brothers. You seem to be parroting what other misinformed (or rather uninformed) people like Anita Sarkeesian say about video games rather than playing them yourself and forming an experienced, logical opinion. Because blanket statements do not work and have been ripped to shreds for some time now by more informative videos.",

It's why the there are virtually no celebrities, politicians, or game developers in the public spotlight who make those claims about her (on the contrary, they give her awards in recognition of her contributions).

If the female mooks are just that, mooks who happen to be female alongside male mooks, that'd be swell. Female representation is a win; ladies can be bad guys too, ; )\n\nThere are factors that one would have to take into consideration when making the female mooks, yes, in order to keep them from being seen in a sexist light. Whether they are dressed in clothes significantly skimpier than their male counterparts (if they have male counterparts), if the female enemies are made mechanically weaker than men (though this could fly if they exceeded the male mooks in dexterity or another attribute, which might make for more diverse and interesting gameplay), things like that, you know? There's <b> nothing </b>wrong with having visually appealing characters or a Boobs Mcgee or two, but it's nice when ladyfolk can be respected just like (or in the case of some cases, hilariously disregarded for the sake of slapstick and japes) the guys.\n\nMy apologies for elaborating on my thoughts so much, but...\n\nGames are an art. Like any other, they have complexity and value, and everything from their art style to their mechanics can speak volumes if you want it to. It's all rather fascinating and exciting to pour through. Playing through a game is wonderful, and for me it become even more wonderful to mentally pick it apart, because it's then and there where all the effort that went into making the game and all it's meaning can be laid out for all to see. I hope to share that joy with others!\n\nHave a lovely day!",

                    "commentText": "justin hope Anita was definitely off on that, because the hookers were intended to be snuck around instead of killed. There was actually mechanical incentive NOT to kill them. They were not mooks as I am speaking about. A mook in a game is an enemy; a character who you can kill who will fight back. An NPC you can kill with no real resistance from them, such as those hookers, is not a mook. So, I must apologize for refuting you, but bringing up those hookers isn't relevant to my initial point.\n\nThough we can discuss those if you'd like! NPCs and <b> sexism </b>has its own mess of fascinating complications.\n\nIf you are including a male version of a female NPC for the express purpose of \"not being accused of<b>  sexism</b>\", you should probably take a hard look at why those characters might be considered sexist in the first place and consider reworking that instead. Is it because the characters are hollow female shells with no character complexity whatsoever? Do they exist only as eye candy for the viewer? There are places where eye candy is acceptable, and not every character has to be given depth and a backstory, but it gets tiresome to repeatedly see female characters who are only hollow shells in bikinis to be rescued, ignored, or killed on the player's whim.\n\nNow, I'm not one to point out a problem without also trying to mull over possible solutions. Adding in the male hookers was indeed a solution, but a very shallow one that didn't address the core of the problem -- that the female hookers are little more than vapid eyecandy. In this case, NPCs like the female hookers in Hitmen might be better received if they were at least balanced out by having one or two side-character hookers who were more three-dimensional characters. You know, people you could talk to and get quests from pertaining more to their personal lives and to the reality of being <b> a woma</b>n (or man -- this could be done with male hookers too!) in t<b> he s</b>ex industry.\n\nI am also well aware that there will always be criticism lobbed at games that dare touch on issues such<b>  as </b>sex work, but we could definitely reduce the criticism if we addressed the issue with tact and understanding!",

                    "commentText": "Jose Galvan Well, if she was labeling ALL videogames as sexist because they portray women as weak, then that would be a troubling blanket statement indeed. It's this perception of games that drives women away from the industry, unfortunately, and we do have to admit that it is in part because of easily-visible (and slowly abating) trends of making female characters damsels in distress.\n\nStatements like hers, however, ignore characters like Chell, the Gerudo, and Faith who are female and are by no means portrayed as weak. I hope we get more characters like Chell in the future. That would help dissolve the stigma of games as inherently sexist, so that women feel less alienated by them.\n\nYou are correct on the physical comparison. Its mild, and its a matter of how our bodies are structured. Maybe it's something that'll eventually even out after hundreds more generations of evolution, or maybe it'll stick around. For now, we have to work to deal with it. Also, the type of exercise matters; aerobics and jogging doesn't do nearly as much for strength as working with weights does. Women tend to be pushed more towards the exercises that don't do much for muscles.\n\nMakes me also wonder how strong intersex people tend to be when compared to men and women, and the why of the outcome. That's a curious topic to consider. Good chatting! <3",

We could take risks, but we instead opt for the comforting and safe hive mind, nurturing our hive mind, warping our idendity and free mind to think like a mob. Being a feminist doesn't mean you fight for equality. It means you declare youself to be part of the tribe, to have safety and nurture of others, do make compromise to ban non-belivers/other people for your own well being.\n\nThat's why I'm a gamer, because I'm part of the tribe that nurtures my well-being and would not turn against me. But unlike PC people, they activly go out of their way to sabbotage others well-being with actions like man-slamming and \"yes means yes\" shit.\n\nThese people are not manginas, these people are simply afraid of bullies, to be alone, to be meaningless. They think they are above grey mass, because they are spoiled by their fellow belivers that they are magnificent. No, your not greater than the grey mass.",

                    "commentText": "@lollmemm Of all the groups of gamers... to say that the console players are the ones that stick up for \"yes means yes\"? Wow... have you ever listened to how those shits react if a girl gets on the mic on ANY FPS? I certainly wouldn't point there for the standard of standing up for women's right to consent. And if you think PC people are any better, let me shed a bit of light...\n\nI'm not a feminist. I am, however, part of that 47% of females that participate in the gaming community. I used to play MMOs quite frequently for about 3 years. I never said a word about me being female, and denied it if I was asked, due to the issues that I faced when the fact was found out. Constant <b> sexual </b>harassment, ranging from the seemingly benine, \"so... you know... I'm single... *wink, wink*\" to extremely graphic and specific descriptions of how they wanted to rape me. Some people dismiss this, as they technically cannot do it because they have no idea where I am... but if you're heavily into gaming, there's also a good chance you can figure out how to back trace an IP. That fear alone was a major factor in my eventually being unable to even consider logging in due to the dread of what I would face for simply enjoying my favorite hobby.\n\nThe point of that is that THAT is what we face. Is it too much to ask that we have the ability to play a female character, or enjoy side female characters, that don't look like Photoshopped Ralph Loren models, aren't dressed in string bikinis for armor and actually have some kind of personality? We all have sexuality, and there's no reason to get rid of that, but if you're going to do that to women at least have some men that are treated in the exact same way. We'd like some eye candy too, you know. Plus,<b>  ga<b> y</b</b>> men would be happy to have that addition, I'm sure. But I doubt it will happen, as it apparently makes straight men EXTREMELY nervous and insecure. Welcome to how women feel every time we watch a movie, see ads, or play the vast majority of video games. As you all like to say about our justified complaints: DEAL WITH IT.\n\nI'm VERY pleased with BioWare, for example-- they write brilliant games, such as the Drag<b> on A</b>ge and Mass Effect titles. THOSE are the games I recommend to people. Though I like the indie scene that I've stumbled onto in the last few years, there aren't many of them that don't rely on the completely overinflated sexuality of 3D females. I have only one criteria that can almost without fail tell me w<b> hat gen</b>der is missing from the development team: \"Look at the female models in the game. Are they realistic? Then there's likely at least<b>  one w</b>oman will pull on that team, or at least a man (or several men) that don't see wom<b> en as no</b>thing mor<b> e th</b>an sex objects. If they are not realistic: it's boys calling the shots.\"",

The reason why that 'tactic' is so damn effective is because women are taught to believe that there's a rapist around every fucking corner. Sure you can say they're just following you around and you can block them-- which is bullshit because most MMO's feature a dastardly little thing called 'world chat' or 'shout' that you can't usually block. Even if you do, everyone else gets to see what this duchebag is saying and following you around attempting to make as many even slightly <b> sexual </b>moves as possible with his limited-animation character and it's fucking infuriating.\n\nAlso, I'm not asking for protection-- we have the ability to report the abuse, and I've done that... not that it often resulted in anything, despite your assertion that they were banned; the best I got was a temporary ban but he simply switched to a different account and continued-- my point is that guys that don't do that shit shouldn't just laugh at it. They should kick the asshat out of their group/also report him. Surely other gamers report or force out duchebags that camp incessantly in online FPS games?\n\nFrankly, yes. I'd rather be killed than be raped. The constant night terrors, inability to walk down a street without being on the verge of breaking down due to fear that he'll come back and do it again... no. I'd rather they say they'll kill me. I could-- and have-- just brushed that shit off. As for being worthless trash and being called out for my sexuality; being accused of being a blue-ball inducing<b>  lesbian</b<b> > dik</b>e is apart of my real life as well as online when I simply tell some guys that I don't want to fuck them. I'm bisexual, but that's not even the goddamn point. The rejection just too much of a blow to their more fragile than glass egos for them to take, so they feel like they have to degrade me as much as possible to feel better. Typical asshat bullies.\n\nAnd PLEASE tell me how women are toxic? Did she insult the size of your dick? Did she say that you couldn't last in bed? Hardly close to what is said to women in terms of harassment. The worst I've ever seen is of those girls that get on games and proclaim the<b> ir gend</b>er just to grab the attention that the rest of us attempt to be invisible to avoid.\n\n\"you'd rather just give up on a hobby cause you got harassed once.\"\nONCE?! Did you not read my fucking comment?\nThis shit was done almost every single session I played, for at least two of the three years I played-- and before that I did my best to be as invisible as possible as I learned the mechanics so I wouldn't be a complete noob when I started looking to join a proper party and really climb the level ladder. And your 'solution' is to BLOCK them? Really? You have no idea... it's not just fuckin' trolls that pull this shit. There's no way there's THAT many trolls in one game that somehow happened to be on the server I was on.",

Well that is fine then, congrats to you. But I do not think this someone chooses to care about the particular subject by choice.

What he is addressing is why is a game, they does a bad job at representing 50% of the worlds population, get such a high score when it does not tell a good story. The game could have been made with a character that was represented with a back story and had oppurtunites. It could have had a Strong female lead that was more than just a <b> sex </b>object. But it didn't. Developers decided that this was not important and it was not added into the game\n\ntldr why is bad story telling a norm.",

            "commentText": "That ESA included games like candy crush which let's be honest is not a gamer's game. Women usually played those types of games. I play a wide range of games from COD, Battlefield, Halo to Fifa and football manager, yet i still don't consider myself a Gamer because I know that's not enough to be a real gamer. With that being said, there are still real female gamers out there. However, there's no doubt that the majority of gamers are men. So when you say \"punch them in the face\" to those that say women don't play real games...then you need a learn the difference between Halo and candy crush.\u00a0\n\nJournalism in gaming is a very sensitive topic and it's probably why there were comments like that there. There's alot of corruption in gaming journalism which has been around for a number of years now. Also any public figure knows that they can be subjected to death threats. Difference is, they all know that death threats are not to be taken seriously. I use Marilyn Manson as an example, he received lots of death threats in the late 90's yet he still did his shows.\n\n1) \"No female leads\" - There are female developers out there. They can easily make a video game like GTA and make a female lead. Society should not dictate the way the game is developed. It would be like writing the material for a comedian to do his set. Also you can hack the game and add mods that you want. So you can make a female character yourself if it really bothers you that much. If the game is not catered to you, then don't play it.\n\n2) \"posters\" - A cartoon <b> woman </b>in a bikini. So what? Does women in a bikini mean that she's a prostitute? It looks like there is a beach in the background so it seems like it's pretty normal attire for a day out on the beach. Sure it an attractive<b>  woman</b> but so what if that helps sell? Besides children are not buying the game seeing as the game is rated 18. If a child does acquire the game, then that's bad parenting.\u00a0\n\n3) \"Women in the game\" - So it's better to be a guy that is a mobster, evil, thief etc. Where are the good guys in the game? The point is, there are no good people in the game. There's only relevant and irrelevant people and it tries to reflect society as much as it can when it comes to perpetrators. Also if there were missions that involved killing women, there would probably be an outcry over men promoting violence against women. You just can't win this.\u00a0\n\n4) \"Shaming women\" - \u00a0Sure women are shamed in this game. We have to understand that it's a game. No-one takes this as reality, otherwise you'd see these things happening alot in society. Games don't want to be an artform in the ways you're suggesting. The artform of games is to be anything it wants to be. That is it's artform. It doesn't want to be controlled in any way. Rap is also considered an artform even though it includes killing men and calling women bitches. It knows know boundaries just like games and is the reason why it's loved. By choosing what happens in games, you're taking away the very soul of a game. It's no long a developers game. If Rockstar gave in to these demands, then people would just stop playing and wait till another game similar to GTA came out. They'll end up playing that one instead.\n\nGTA will offend some people sure. That's what's so good about it. It allows you to enter a fantasy world which seems very similar to ours. If you don't like the game, then play another game.\u00a0\n\nI love how for years Men who loved video games and comics were looked at as nerds, undesirable by women and living in basements. The psychological impact it had on these people didn't matter at all at that time. However now, the very games that they enjoy are being taken over by people who people who never cared for them in the first place, and quite frankly, don't care about the game. Just because there's money in gaming, there's more people around. If racing cars in the streets was legal and a multi billion dollar industry, you'd have women arguing about how th<b> e woma</b>n at the start is half naked when she calls t<b> he ra</b>ce.",

            "commentText": "I just want to say that I'm a girl who plays WoW to a point that it could be considered unhealthy, and to all the girls out there who play LoL or WoW or any of the really big MMO's, that the way we are treated isn't because every boy/man that plays them is \"misogynistic\" but because most of these games predominantly consist of males. I understand there are some sexist comments that are thrown at you but you have to understand not every male gamer is out to get you or objectify you. You can't have tissue paper skin when you play these games. A lot of men/boys probably react to you the way they do (with comments like, \"OMG A GIRL?!, MARRY ME?) because they are genuinely surprised that a girl is playing that game, or maybe just flirtatiously poking fun at you. If the tables were turned and the games we played consisted mostly of females, I'm almost positive the treatment we receive, we would have given to the men. I understand how it feels to be ridiculed for being a girl and playing a game. People would expect me to be horrible at the game because I was a girl and if they thought I was good it mean't I was <b> fat </b>and ugly. If someone is being hateful or toxic to you, you just have to ignore them because they aren't worth your time. If they think you're bad for being a girl then prove them wrong. And if you are bad at the game then it's fine because there are plenty of bad male players too. And it's not just girls who have to put up with shit. Some guys and gals are mean to each other and you just have to learn not to be so sensitive about it because in the end WE ALL have to put up with each other's shit.",

            "commentText": "Do games have <b> sexism?</b> Yes they do and it is good that we do have conversations about it. So how is the<b>  sexism</b> portrayed in gaming? Well in many ways and very differently in between different sexes.\n\nFor example, most protagonists are males and usually white males. While I have no issues with it if the artist wants to make them white and male, I would still love more diversity in gaming protagonists.\n\nIn the future as technology develops and the industry grows even more, I suspect that we will be havin<b> g gende</b>r variation options in every single possible game and that they will be done so that it addresses your chos<b> en gend</b>er variation. And skin colors too, pretty much all the good character customization options there are.\n\nNow at the moment, there certainly are stereotypes in gaming for both sexes. Women tend to be portrayed often as sidekicks or romantic pursuits. Like I already said once before, this is fine as long as the artist themselves want it to be like that. But it doesn't have to be and diversity is more than welcome.\n\nMen tend to fill the role of protagonist, the hero, the one that carries the whole platform or the villians of gaming that <b> are noth</b>ing more than pure punching bags to the game characters. Redundant mass almost. This is also important to address when you look at<b>  the se</b>xism in gaming.\n\nWhat about gamer behavior and the issue of males getting harassed more but women getting more personalized harassments? This is true and unfortunate since the girls I play with are actually very good gamers and fun to play games with.\n\nThe issue with this is that psychologically males use 7 times more grey in their brains matter than girls do. Grey matter are localized areas in our brains that process information and focus. This means that boys have more tendency to have a tunnel vision and focus on one specific thing at a time. While they are focused, like playing in video games, they can become very insensitive of the world around them.\n\nAdd to the fact testosterone, a hormone that is mainly used in male bodies that supports aggressive and competitive behavior in males further adds males primal need to be competitive and dominating even.\u00a0This explains the way males sometimes act the way they do online.\n\nIt has more to do with biological bodily functions than their personality per say, although it is true that practicing self awareness of own behavior and maturity often can help the person from at least voicing their thoughts if anything else.\n\nHow about girls then? Well it is also proven that girls have on average 10 times more white matter in their brains. White matter is the parts of brains that move around information and operate sensory systems as well as processing accomplishments faster. This means in practice is that female brains are more adapt to think somewhat more complicated but in more conclusive manner as well.\n\nFemale brains are also more adapt to have sense of surroundings and because of this, girls do sense things that male brains don't. So female brains do have a greater concept of words, tones, behavior and whatnot while male brains are much more direct and simpler in this scenario. Because of this, female brains are more sensitive in that they are more aware of what is actually really harmful and rude while male brains just pass it all as the same fodder.\n\nFemale brains also process accomplishments faster than male brains do. This means for example, that female brains are faster at reacting to anything than male brains are which can be a huge benefit in games that require fast reflexes.\n\nI am a psychologist so I know a bit about neuroscience between genders.\n\nA good scenario of that senselessness in male brains is an example that I faced some months ago. I was playing in a game all by myself with 3 randoms. One of the randoms turned out to be a girl, and while I did not jump the gun and treated her normally as a fellow gamer in my eyes, I still managed to act like a douchebag, although unintentionally.\n\nSo here is how it went:\n\nGirl: Do not piss off a girl with flamethrower! :D\n\nMe: Do not piss off a girl in general.\n\nGirl: That is incredibly offensive.\n\nAnd she left the game. Now at this point I felt really bad because in my eyes it was meant to be a compliment and not an insult. What I thought was that girls are strong enough like males are that you really shouldn't piss off a girl because she can kick your ass.\n\nBut my mistake, because she found it offensive rather than a compliment of girl strength.\n\nHowever the further I thought about it, I was further confused as to what I said wrong. I have always had the policy that pissing off anyone in general is not a very good idea, no matter if the person is a girl or a boy.\n\nSurely she would agreed if I would have followed my comment with the notion that pissing off guys isn't a good idea either, because pissing of people in general is not a good idea.\n\nI mean who goes around streets, pissing off people just for personal laughs. And I wonder how many times that asshole person would have gotten their ass kicked to the orbit. Because I suspect that if you would act like a huge douchebag to people you do not know, you would find yourself in hospital very often.\n\nThen again, I also know that I might be insensitive since my male brains aren't programmed to notice things as well as female brains are. So it might be entirely my own douchebag attitude that I am just not aware off or that the girl I was talking to was just hyper sensitive and in the mood of looking for fights. In any case, there are differences how females and males behave and understanding that also helps you to deal with the situations a bit better.\n\nTL;DR\n\nNow, like I said in the beginning of this post. Gaming is sexist towards both sexes in very different ways and being aware of it helps because it makes the developers consider alternative options more than they do know. And while I have no issues how things are now because artistic freedom is more important<b>  than g</b>ender politics in a artificial and virtual world, I still welcome diversity if the artist so chooses to do.",

Nevertheless, he didn't complain about that in this video.\n\nHe also states that\u00a0stereotypical women\u00a0are only a problem because there are no well developed females characters to contra balance it. Again I don't know if this is factually true or not in average.\n\nThis are big differences.\u00a0\n\n\"Female protagonist games are welcome, but they have to be exceptional.\" - I was not talking about\u00a0female protagonist, I was taking about\u00a0females in position of power. Kreia is a villain for example.\n\nMaybe you are right about \u00a0not exceptional female characters being a bad idea, not sure. Lets look at shows were they tried to be more \"feminist\".\n\nKathryn Janeway from star trek voyager is a great example of a failed female character. They were trying to make the show less male dominated and they failed. She is pretty bad.\n\n\u00a0Kara Starbuck from battle star galactic worked pretty well and they just converted a male charted to a female maintaining almost the same personality.\n\nNevertheless,\u00a0battlestar galactica is a much better show than star trek voyager, maybe you are right about that.",

                    "commentText": "@Mikasa Pinata\nI get that. Thaks for making that lucid enough though. The point is, when considering representations of women (let's say specifically in GTA 5), the game draws from believable scenarios. Meaning that you have women pedestrians but also women as strippers or prostitutes. Similarly you have male pedestrians but also male security guards, henchmen, soldiers and criminals. Because that is a game that draws upon believability. Sure, there are a small number of male strip clubs, prostitutes, etc. and there are a good number of female cops, security detail, soldiers etc. but the number is lesser.\n(In fact, I actually remember seeing female cops gun me down twice in the game which was quite a surprise. No male strip clubs though-would be a good addition to future games for all those straight women and <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>men :P)\nBut the point I want to segue into is that when women are represented in a positive light it's all fine and dandy but the moment women are inflicted violence upon, killed or otherwise you have people protest (Remember how GTA 5 was banned in Australia and why). I think that that is unfair. If we are to pursue strong, fleshed out female characters (which we should) then we shouldn't treat them as fragile entities when put in a gritty world like that of GTA 5 or other video games. That's my only problem with people who propose better female representation but do not want them to suffer if the story demands.",

Gamers don't care about <b> gender </b>and there are other games for women.\u00a0\n\nAround 14:00 minutes you pretty much describe your bias. How a<b>  woman</b> character in game is only as good as how powerful she is to the plot or in more direct terms. Next time when I go see Hunger Games III Movie I'll be sure bitch and moan a lot about \u00a0how sexist that movie is against men. How it portrays the man as a damsel in distress needing saving from Jennifer Lawrence and her bow.\u00a0\n\nJust play the games don't insult a community while making money doing it. I don't care if you are ma<b> n woma</b>n child or<b>  a fr</b>og. Gamers only care about one thing when it comes to other players, and that's if you are \"good at the game\".",

And I wouldn't brand anyone as 'misogynist' or 'sexist' who simply or even 'passionately' argued this, but don't you think a lot of the 'hateful' comments she received were beyond rational critique of her work? I really don't know how anyone is going to justify the abuse directed towards her about 'killing her family' or raping/murdering her and then \"drinking blood from her c***\". In the context of the hate campaign against her, I can very much understand why people are supporting her. And hey, if any guy got the sheer volume of abusive comments she's gotten, I would definitely sympathise equally with him. It's beyond <b> gender,</b> people might cry 'sexism' or whatever, but it's more than that - there's been a lack of humanity.\n\nI also did say that people clearly 'do care'. I said that in my comment - I was responding to the original commenter who was trying to say people \"don't care\". I think you and I agree there at least?\n\nAnd one last point - does social critique always need a tonne of research? I mean (as a non-gamer, don't hold it against me, I was just curious!!) from watching her videos, the snippets from the games themselves are pretty convincing sources. And some of the games she uses like GTA5 are hardly obscure. Anyway, she's only a \"scam\" as much as casinos are. People will always choose to throw their money away on what matters to them. I guess if people are interested, why shouldn't they financially support her project? Not for you and me to decide.\n(SORRY I ALWAYS WRITE TOO MUCH!)",

That IS a BENEFIT.\n\nMost other competitive modes however, don't give anyone special treatment and are ruthless to all.

Women are still being \"mistreated\"... who cares if men are though, right? The disposable vermin mal<b> e gende</b>r.\u00a0\n\nSo much for equality...

If they were smart, they'd report, ignore and move right along, but this clearly doesn't happen if everyone on that side of the fence (most of which aren't real gamers) is raising such a big fuss.\n\nAnd yeah, go ahead throw ad hominems.

Not as much as now or as much as men... but guess what? Everything has been fine by them... until Sarkeesian and the feminists/SJWs decided to jump in and start policing shit with their PC BS.\n\nUnderepresented or misrepresented? Are you fucking kidding me? I'm a <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>male, and I don't bitch about lack o<b> f g<b> a</b</b>>y characters (both male and female, which there are WAY LESS of, and are usually displayed as stereotypes). AND EVEN LESS TRANS CHARACTERS!!!\nAnd if you're stating you're under/misrepresented when there's so many female characters out there, (some bad and good, both in design and/or in practice) I'll either call you a liar or a whiner.\nBecome a dev and change that if you think it's a big problem... you definitely can, no one is stopping you. But will the game sell? Will it be enjoyed? Cause in the end, that's what gamers want, regardless<b>  of gen</b>der. And if you don't get the money to fund the next game from your first, you're probably out of a job or at the very least, not gaining any profit.\n\nAnd opinions matter if they have merit. Sarkeesian (sorry if I mention her name a lot, but SHE is the one who started this utter shite storm of nonsense) has been pointed out to not really be a gamer (she has been recorded saying that video games are, and I QUOTE \"gross\") and has not given credit to the Let's Play-ers that she stole footage from, AS well as completely lying in some of said videos. I should really care about that type of person's opinions? And the opinions of those who follow her blindly?\n\nAnd I don't think gaming is simply for men. Let me be clear on my opinion of this: games are primarily geared towards MOSTLY men, but are usually universally enjoyable.\u00a0\nStatistics are clear, men are more interested in hardcore games at a significantly higher rate then women, and casual games tend to be towards unisex (or children depending on the game). And the less casual games are becoming ever more female-friendly (and not in a bad way... yet).\n\nI'm sorry if I seem frustrated, but so many seem fixated on making games totally politically correct, and so female empowering, and I have no problem with the latter so long as it doesn't shame men or make them look like crap, but it usually does when it comes to feminism. Look at college sports, it has to be 5<b> 0/50 ge</b>nder ratio, even if significantly less girls are interested. I don't want it to have quotas like this in game design and such, because I know there's people out there like Anita, who will simply get in to stamp out anything she doesn't like or find appropriate.",

I'm not that interested in Anita, since I have formed my own opinion out of my own experience.\u00a0\n\nI honestly believe that the reason games are played more by men is the result of games being developed for male audience. It's very adrocentric, and could very likely be the reason why women have less interest in \"hardcore games\" games. But hardcore games isn't more of a \"real game\" and other games according to me. It's just more hardcore, just another genre really. That's why unisex games like the sims and many games on phones that doesn't have specific <b> gender </b>targeted have way more female players. like you said, if I understood you correctly.\n\nIt's really isn't the game developers fault or mens fault. Society has created this both men and women, movies are the same. It's manmade, therefore it can be changed.\n\nI'm sure that more women will start playing more games if it become more female friendly. We shouldn't prevent something that could actually be good for everybody, it's not just female that wants things to change, men that fight on our side clearly isn't offended or find it to be shaming men. You should feel untouched.\n\nJust let Anita do whatever it is she is doing, ignore it and you will feel much better.\u00a0\nIf things really are changing then let it.

What I learned through my experience, and how I behave now because of it:\nI always choose a neutral in game name. I dont use teamspeak unless I have to, cause ive had plenty of games derailed by an argument about me being a girl. If I do use teamspeak I try to use it after Ive established my position on the team, bcs my experience was if people are aware of my <b> gender </b>before hand they will question my ability to play, and every mistake or disagreement in strategy will be pointed out to me, and made a bigger deal. These are basic rules of conduct so I have a normal gaming experience. \n\nThe one thing this guy points out that makes 0 sense with your argument is why does it matter to you? Why does an idea of more female playable characters or protagonists bother you? If you only care if the game is good, and if the players are good at the game, then why does it matter if the main character is a<b>  woman</b> or a man?",

            "commentText": "Stupid comments everywhere. \"but the feminists will complain\" is NOT a good reason to not develop female characters in video games and continue to marginalize the female population. Why don't you actually make a game with equally good male and female characters, and then see what people's actual reactions are. You cannot make decisions based on things that haven't even happened. I swear the excuses people come up with to maintain the status quo are such bullshit. No matter how many statistics and facts we show some people about <b> sexism,</b> they still think their imaginary and narrow-minded perception - that the advocacy for women will lead to<b>  sexism</b> towards men - is already an existing fact. Basically, because of the possibility that men MIGHT be treated unfairly, we shouldn't bother trying to treat women equally at all. These people think their biased opinion is more legitimate and real and worth caring about than the abhorrent statistics feminists reference. These people cry out hypocrisy when they find one double standard in favor of women. They think that that one double standard in favor of us makes up for the 20 double standards in favor of them. It's either women play it completely fair without straying a hair, or the men refuse to cooperate. Everything has got to be 50/50 or male dominated. God forbid a video game cast ever consist of two women and one man!! Oh my God. It's the Apocalypse. Humanity has been misrepresented. Women are not universally relatable. They're all the same! There can only be a toke<b> n woma</b>n becaus<b> e \"Wom</b>an\" is a character type category equal to \"Grouchy\" \"Brainy\" and \"Clumsy\". Yes, I'm looking at you smurfs with your \"Smurfette\". Is there any reason that half the smurfs couldn't be female? Do grouchy, brainy, clumsy, etc. women not exist? Is being a vain man different from being a v<b> ain wo</b>man? Now look, I'm not dissing the smurfs, but using it as an analogy. It's not as obvious as in the smurfs, but in many med<b> ia, \"W</b>oman\" is a token character. It's insulting. We're more than 50% of the population, but get to be represented by only one character? How does that make sense? Now I know I got off topic, but if anyone would like to see equal representation in male and female characters, watch the Avatar TV series. You know, if trying to be equal in positive ways is too hard for everyone to swallow, then maybe we should just aim to try to be equal in negative ways. Hey everyone, let's increas<b> e the s</b>exual objectification of men! Let every commercial feature a naked man. Let every male superhero dress like <b> Wonder</b> Woman and have their junk graphically outlined. Their current costumes are just way too conservative and dignified!",

They will either:\n1. treat us as delicate flowers, not tell us off when we do something wrong, say it doesn't matter or just white knight us when someone flames.\u00a0\n2. Treat us as we do not belong, not give us buff's because it's a waste to them, claiming the reason we might be bad is because we're women, that we belong in the kitchen and if we're actually good it's amazing to them.\n\n\"A girl that games? I wanna marry you!\"\nIf it's a girl who's good at the game, she'll be called out as having an ebay acc or having been boosted, and if she's bad, that's normal and to some desirable because teaching a girl the game and helping her is apperantly something to want.\u00a0\n\nTo me it's not shocking at all that several boys that I know have felt a little <b> weird </b>when I teach them stuff about a game or end up having better stats than them, or even when I call another lane or roll than they expect me to want.\u00a0\nI fucking HATE premades that just assume the girl is going to go support, Please, bruiser top. I'm not a girl gamer, I'm a gamer that happens to possess a vagina.\u00a0\n\nWe make up almost half of the audience now and you better show us some goddamn respect, I'm sick of this.\u00a0\nAND P.S, THE SIMS IS A REAL GODDAMN GAME OK ;@@@@@@@@@\nGAAAAAAAAAAAAAHD.",

This is true, but these sources include any form of gaming,\u00a0even mobile gaming and maybe even facebook gaming. So, given all this it's not really a surprising statistic. However, when it comes to more\u00a0\"hardcore\" gaming, on console but particularly competitively on PC, it is still ruled by a pretty\u00a0solid majority of males. Apparently women only make up 16% of\u00a0WoW players, for one. Honestly, if women truly were as <b> common </b>in these types of games as you believe, the problem wouldn't exist, as\u00a0you'd be playing with almost 50% women and no one would think female presence was something to make note of.\n\nI'm not agreeing with unequal treatment of women in gaming, and I agree that no matter the demographical differences, everyone should be treated with respect, but the misconception surrounding the figures is basis of things that are close to this topic that I don't agree with.

I remember going to a game store to purchase wow airtime and when the clerk asked if I gamed and I replied yes he then asked \"what, only WoW right?\".\nSo some people don't even see that as a real game.\n\nFunny thing is a few years before that I worked in a gaming store as I have been passionate about games since before I can remember (4, 5 years <b> old </b>? some where in the mid 80s). I grew up with PC games from<b>  old</b> dos games (tertis,\u00a0 heros quest, Trivial Pursuit) through 90's pc games (warcraft2+3, starcraft, final fantasies, Counterstrike, quake), PS2 (i have +-200 games in my collection), PS3 and Newer PC games (wow, SC2, D3, Witcher), xbox 360, PC Lans, Console lans and now to PS4 (I am currently playing Watchdogs and Destiny).\u00a0 He didn't know this ofc. He just looked snarkly at his friend as though to say \"see, girls don't play \"real\" games. They don't' play OUR games\".\n\nI moderator a popular local gaming forum as well. I don't advertise I am a girl and only th<b> e ol</b>d regular posters really know for sure that I am. It's funny how people are shocked when they find out. Same goes for MMOs.\nIn Wow my main is a male chracter, again people are shocked when they find out I am female as I am top highest DPS in raids. To be fair in my raiding guild there are only 2 girls and in my more social guild there was more ladies (7:10). Are those women that don't raid\u00a0 less of a gamer? No. I see them online at least an hour most days and more on the weekends. It is their passion and its what they spend their free time and money on.\n\nI think some men use the \"real\" gamer thing because they see that \"their\" space is being invaded by women and there is some male ego thing that says they need to claim a piece of it for themselves. To Define themselves as \"more\" or \"better\". Funny thing we have been here all long.",

First of all,i had to make the generalistion because i was refering to female gamers specifically, there is no negative stigma attached to it. Second of all, both genders are to blame for the way females are portrayed. What i find ammusing is how they will carry it on until it becomes inconvinient for them. By that i mean <b> woman </b>will complain about the way they are viewed, but they'll continue to use thier bodies anyway lol. This is why thy're portrayed like that. (I don't agre with it by any means, but it's everyones fault). The last bit doesn't make any sense, i know men give<b>  woman</b> tips on beauty. But im trying to say that for the most part, genders giving advice in a realm that they're not usually associated with. Will cause someone to become baffled by it.\n\nAnd this is also why males don't like females butting into thier shit. Because they all of a sudden have to change to everything because females don't like it. If we don't,females will tell bullshit facts( female gamers make up half the gaming population in the US, not the rest of the world). Shout alot ( as seen by 95% of feminists).",

I've said that I hate it. That's it. I said I'm not at all suprised that some men find it <b> weird </b>when I'm better at a game than they are or I teach them something, so there's no point i explaining why to me. I totally get it. What I said was that they're weirded out because I'm a girl in their territory and then you said pretty much the exact same thing. It's not really comparable with make up tho, because not nearly as many guys do make up as girls play games and most guys that DO actually do make up are professionals so even in make up some men tell us what to do and how to do it.\u00a0\n\nEither way, the point is that its wrong.\u00a0\nMost girls that I know play because they like it, that there's a few typical \"gamer girls\" out there who stream and use their bodies and a high pitch voice to earn money from it does not mean that anywhere close to all of us do this, or rather, most of us DON'T do this.\u00a0\nSadly these girls are the ones who get attention, because they want it.\u00a0\nObviously they're gonna be seen more often than us who just game and don't really care about being a so called girl gamer.\u00a0\n\nIt's not the same people btw.\u00a0\nYou were saying that we complain about how we're viewed and carry on using or bodies anyway, or something like that.\u00a0\nNOT the same girls doing these things.\u00a0\nThere's me and girls like me who just completely hates being a girl in games, and then there's the girl who embraces it and makes it harder for the rest of us to get taken seriously.\u00a0\nWhat makes it even worse is the fact that we pretty much have to be very overweight, somewhat less pretty and not concerned about beuaty to get taken seriously.

So if you don't want a comment back. Make sure you're not posting comments completely discrediting ALL male gamers. ''The thing is that in these different mobas, fps's and mmo's and such, if they find out that we are female, one of two things will happen. They will either:\n1. treat us as delicate flowers, not tell us off when we do something wrong, say it doesn't matter or just white knight us when someone flames.\u00a0\n2. Treat us as we do not belong, not give us buff's because it's a waste to them, claiming the reason we might be bad is because we're women, that we belong in the kitchen and if we're actually good it's amazing to them.''\n\nAlso, if you understand it all. Why feel the need to say that you wouldn't be surprised if you told a boy something \u00a0 he didn't know in gaming and was shocked? Because it's not relevant to anything. Obviously segregation exists between genders and thier respective hobbies. If you really understood you'd appreciate the male perspective as well. Also to say that the scenarios aren't comparable because not as many men do make up as females play games, is kinda <b> dumb.</b> Because your basically saying that their needs wouldn't count as much as the female gamers. Due to the lack of males interested in that specific hobbies. Which in turns shows that most people ignorant in the retarded war bewtween females and males. Simply use<b>  sexism</b> as a front to further thier own ambitions. Even if the person isn't aware of it. This is what you're doing atm btw. Ignorance is bliss\u00a0\n\nAs to the second part. Unfortunatley i was refering to females a whole. ( i don't mean All females, just easier to make a majority generalisation.) It's difficiult to erase a stereotype that females themselves refinforced for centuries.\u00a0\n\nThe last part is closely linked to my first comment. You say all male gamers can be catagorised in only of two situations Despite it being wrong because their obivously are males who aren't White Knights. But yet you make the agruement of individuality to suit your case. ''NOT the same girls doing these things.\u00a0\nThere's me and girls like me who just completely hates being a girl in games, and then there's the girl who embraces it and makes it harder for the rest of us to get taken seriously.''\u00a0\n\nThe very last bit is case of self worth and conifidence. If you wanna be heard and taken seriously then do it. PLus it's not true,as male and gamer I know all to all well that males will never really take a female who i<b> s fa</b>t,ugly etc seriosuly. Ever. ( i won't sugar coat the words becuase beauty is subjective)",

I have never said I meant ALL men, I've never said that every single dude does these things, just that it always happens. Whether it's ONE dude in a group of ten, or five in a group of five, I never said. You shouldn't tell me I'm doing something wrong when you're doing the exact same thing.\u00a0\n\nAnd it's not really an argument of individuality, it's basically two groups, exactly like I divided men into two groups in the first comment.\u00a0\nThere's ladies who just wanna be treated like everyone else in their games and there's girl who exploit the shit out of the fact that they're female to earn skins, money, objects, games, admin-positiions and whatnot. Then ofc theres different grey-areas of this and some migh just use their <b> gender </b>a little while for the mostpart they just wanna play and not have to deal with<b>  sexism</b>.\u00a0\n\nI didn't mean to put all the blame on men you know, because I know this isn't true. The question was not about gamer girls exploiting the fact that they're female tho, it was abou<b> t sexis</b>m, so I wrote solely about t<b> he sexi</b>sm I have to deal with.\u00a0\n\nAnd no, ofc it's my fault that you didn't get the whole make-up thing because I'm not even sure I actually wrote it all. I have absoluit<b> ely noth</b>ing against men doing make-up and most girls simply do not care. Most of the time it's other men telling a dude he can't wear make up. Some of the best professonals when it comes to make up are of the <b> male ge</b>nder so even in beauty some men tell us what to do and when. Th<b> ere's no</b>thing wrong with it as far as I think, but it's not really a fair comparison.\u00a0\nThere's not nearly as many men doing make up as there is female gamers, and there is not nearly as many professional female gamers as there are male make up artists.\u00a0\nThe argument to start with was <b> that a</b> woman wou<b> ld fee</b>l weird taking beauty-tips from a man, and this is not even close to true, Which was my point to begin with, apperantly I didn't do a too good job att explaining it tho.

Completely failing to recognise the male perspective. So yeah ill comment when you talk shit that is, lets face it. sexist.\n3. This is the most annoying bit which you don't seem to understand. You make the case that not as many men do make up as females play game. So therefore you can't compare the case. Well, no where near as many females play games as boys ( its' only half in america) so why should we cater to your wants? You can't simply say your cause is more justified just because of a larger number of followers. Even so, men who do beauty was only an example. The logic is applicable to every spectrum. You were the one who dug further into the example. Which revealed the (perhaps) subconsious superiority complex.\n4. Your point to begin with was that all male gamers are prejudice and you falsley used an example of something that exists every where to further your own cause.\u00a0\n5.

This is because league of legends is a team game, and the team composition that is best will depend on the enemies picks and that is the case every single game, therefore you gotta get used to playing support as well as any other role. With that being said you should know that amongst all games League of Legends has one of the worst communities and everyone is suffering from it - it's just something you need to get used to.

Pricks just being pricks I'm used to, I'm not really sensitive either. I'm so very used to it and I've been a gamer since I was 13 and I'm 21 now. Back then I liked the attention I got from being a girl, in for example wow, but with time I realized how annoying it is that I can't just be a gamer, in people's eyes, they see me as a GIRL gamer no matter what.

And yeah, it makes no sense to treat female gamers differently, just like I find it ridiculous when ESL has tournaments only for females, since the teams don't really interact with each other, so the need is not there, as there is no difference between a man and a <b> woman </b>in gaming like there is in physically exhausting sports like football, tennis etc. where the male has a gigantic advantage just by being male.\u00a0\nAs for the term gamer girl, I don't find it to be sexist - it simply acknowledges the fact that females are very much a minority in the vast majority of multiplayer games, and therefore you don't come across female gamers that often, even in games where voice communication is the norm (making it easy to identify genders).\nWhy would someone whiteknight you when he finds out you are a gamer girl? Well, maybe it's because of a large part of the community being immature (the younger, the more likely to be immature, fact, boys aged 17> are much more<b>  common</b> than adult women in the games I imagine you having these experiences in, no matter what some hipster tells you on Ted), and therefore he wants to make sure you have a comfortable experience while playing with him, since females are generally a lot more sensitive to the shit that goes on online than men are. It is actually quit<b> e commo</b>n everywhere for the communication and behavior to change drastically once a female enters the nearby world - if you were a guy, you'd know this. Every single guy I know behaves drastically different when there are chicks around, it's a simple universal fact. Realize when you're on guy territory, expect male behavior - and that includes offensive comments based on simple things that don't matter - males get them too, and we just laugh about it. There aren't a lot of places where we men are free to be men, so when you step on our territory, which you are more than welcome to do, you can't just expect us to change our behavior to the more sensitive people like we do almost everywhere else where we aren't \"alone\".\u00a0\n\nWhy would anyone make any assumptions about you based on yo<b> ur gend</b>er? Well, maybe it's because you're a minority that is to find almost nowhere in top competitive play, and therefore it would seem logic that you have a lesser understanding of the game - is it rational? No, but neither is much else people do. I can tell you that it is possible to find people to play with, who will not whiteknight you and will not make offensive comments, but you might wanna look into playing a different game then.",

I'd go with Richard Lynn's studies of IQ to explain why females aren't making it to the top in most areas, including gaming, instead of some nonsense theory about females not being able to play their favourite roles, when we all know that's a bs excuse. Another good explanation is the fact that there are far less female gamers, and those that exist probably play less on average.\u00a0\nBtw I'm not making excuses, I'm explaining to you, why the gaming community can be a bit rough and why that's not always a bad thing.

How is gendercide, rape as an act of war, and being sold in any way not as bad?\u00a0\nTry not to let this become a competition and just realize that treating women this way is disgusting and stop justifying it.\u00a0\n\nI never said ANYTHING about women hatred, so I never drew any paralells between wanting to protect a female and hatred of women, you did. I've never seen a <b> woman </b>treating a man differently, though they might act differently to seem more cute, It's<b>  nothing</b> compared to how the two extemes o<b> f sexis</b>m a lot of us have to put up with. I'm not saying men are worse, just than a male in gaming is the norm so there's no reason to treat any of them/you any different, and the opposite seems to go for women.\u00a0\n\nNo one has ever asked you to take responsibility for how other men act, at least not here, so don't give me that. It should be obvious that when I say men, I mean SOME/MOST men withing the GAMING COMMUNITY (and I mean, I play LoL, WoW, Gmod and a few other games on and off and I haven't played with every active male gamer withing these games, so it's obviously a quite limited), not every single man on this planet or every man that has ever played a game.

It's literally in my first post, BOTH of the two things that can happen, suck ass. \nI don't WANT you fucking attention, I don't WANT you to fawn over me because I'm a<b>  woman</b> and I play \"real\" games. It's noooot wanted and most of the time it's creepy. WHAT is so hard about just treating people the same? \nSomeone here commented that we get treated as bad as everyone else and that we just make up that it's because of ou<b> r gende</b>r. If this was true, that we don't get treated at all differently, then why are there men who treat us better ONLY because we're female? Why are there people who flame me UNTIL they find out I'm<b>  a wom</b>an, then they stop? \nI don't care that people call me out on my mistakes, I want you to, but not because I'<b> m a wo</b>man, saying shit like \"girls can't play games, they belong in the kitchen\" or things like that. Or jokes about them wanting to sleep with me, marry me, date me, w/e. It's horrible. \n\nYes I realize that the stats are skewed. That doesn't excuse the behaviour tho and it honestly shouldn't outweigh everything else I made points about in my original post. \n\nOh, and it IS a problem that there's barely any fully dressed non sexualized female characters in games (for example LoL) today. It's gotten better since I first posted all this in this game in particular (for example, more undressed men, more non sexualised and undressed females, less boobs<b>  and </b>thin wastes and so on), but it's still a thing. \n\nAND lastly, the same guy who said we get treated the same already also said that I just proved to be a delicate flower by posting this. To you (prolly a dude, this one) I wanna say, tell<b> ing a </b>woman that she's a delicate flower for talking about something that is problematic to her and other women is LITERALLY the shit men have been doing since the dawn of time, and the reason feminism exists.

Also why its not a problem how men are dressed in video games?Why men are always clothed, not sexualized and act certain way etc. Its equally as \"sexist\" towards men if you so decide to call it.

Yes it's a problem that male characters are really strong and muscly, but it's not sexualizing, it's idealizing. One of them has correlation to what society thinks about how a certain group of people should dress and be. The other has correlation to macho culturem they're both shit. \nSo, now the two groups, female and male characters in game, have in <b> common </b>that they are usually drawn with bodies that are almost impossible to achieve (you need to wear a corset for years to get that<b>  thin</b> of a waist for example). But male characters are rarely undressed to the extent of the female characters. They're not sexualized to the same extent and THAT REALLY IS THAT. \n\nBesides, this honestly isn't even the important bit because obviously we play the games anyways and we can see that it's starting to change slowly, with more 'macho' women and more sexualized men. \nThe problem however is that women absolutely do get treated differently, I even asked a transwoman about this yesterday, she absolutely notices the difference, and how demeaning it is to be called \"good for being a girl\"  and get creepy attention. Guys who pretend to be female in games notice the difference, honestly wtf.\nOfc theres a bunch of men telling women how it actually is, that what they experiance isn't a real experiance. \nThis is literally like saying women and men don't get treated differently on like Tinder. U fkn stupid if you don't realize it. And it honestly doesn't even MATTER what you think, you're not the one this is happening to, shut your moooouths.",

It's kinda problematic that you strengthen the idea that there is a certain way you need to be as a man. It's the exakt same as telling girls they need to be ladylike, no matter if your view of a \"real\" man is someone who respects women or someone who is macho AF. There should be NO \"real men\"-idea. It is literally what makes (some) men fkn <b> crazy.</b> The idea that a man NEEDS to be certain things.

Something you dont like SEXIST you dont get that buff SEXIST. seriously get good and prove them wrong. you can call yourself a gamer but you need to love the game an<b> d nothin</b>g but the game. And if you try and censore the game you only make it vanilla. Is that what you want vanilla bland flavourless where is the magic? WHERE IS THE ADVENTURE? WHERE IS THE THRILL OF BEATING THAT GUY WHO DOMINATED YOU HALF THE ROUND. NO everything should be vanilla no one should be better no one should be rude to push you to be better.

Majority of us DO NOT WANT TO BE GIVEN THINGS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF OUR <b> GENDER </b>honestly WHAT is so fucking hard to understand with \"we want to be treated EQUALLY\"??? Equally meaning NO special treatment, no matter if it's GOOD special treatment or bad. \nWANT NONE OF IT. That's why soooooo fucking many of us have unisex names and don't disclose our<b>  gender</b> until we legit start talking to someone who obviously had no idea and/or didn't care to begin with. \nAnd I know, as a female, with looooads of female friends who play games, that they HATE being treated differently. I hate being gifted shit from my male friends because I know they do it to hit on me, they know this, so I mostly just get gifted shit from my female friends, and I gift them back. \n\nI have once in my life (when I was 15, I'm soon to be 24 now) used the fact that I'm a girl to get 500g in wow so that I could afford artisan flying, and it didn't feel good, it felt awful, so I never did it again. \n\nYou're way off. I never EVER said anything like people shouldn't be rude. I don't believe that toxic behaviour and/or flame makes anyone play better, personally I make a million more mistakes when I'm angry than when I'm just laughing at my own mistakes and having a good time. Flame makes me angry = flame makes me play worse = flame doesn't fkn help. \nHOWEVER, I think I said the opposite to \"no one can be mean to women\", I'm 100% sure I said I DO NOT want to be treated differently, meaning that if a person would flame a guy for a mistake, he should flame me too for that same mistake. THAT is treating people the same no matter thei<b> r gende</b>r. It's only a problem when the flaming doesn't have as much to do with the skill the female has and more that she is a girl. You wouldn't tell a guy that he belongs in a kitchen or that he's \"good for being a guy\", and so, you really shouldn't say these things to women either. If you'd say \"why did you do that idiot\" to a dude, you should say the same to the girl who makes the same mistake.  Get it?",

You wouldn't know, unless you systematically tell people you're female to experience it. Those men that have done that AGREE that we get a looooot of creepy and mean shit thrown at us, ALONG with some 'advantages' (like creepy dudes thinking you'll ride their dick if they give you a skin or acting like you can't handle the same things as everyone so they insist you get your favorite role or lane, maybe I want to be pushed to try something different like pretty much everyone aside from supports are)\n. Your experiences as a male has absolutely NOOOOOOOOOO meaning in a discussing about female experiences in gaming. If you think about it just a little, it's pretty clear why. \n\nGood on you tho for not caring about<b>  gender</b>. I know there's a lot of people that don't le<b> t gende</b>r decide how you treat someone in game, and I'm glad.

I don't like the word mansplaining but it's literally what you just did. \nDon't you think I know there are rude people irl? Rude people in general are not the problem. \nIt's NOT one person, similar things happen all the time, and that's a pattern that strongly proves that not mainly gaming itself, but the community, is sexist. \n\nI just need you to think about what you're all doing. I mean this honestly. I'm not saying this to prove anything or shame you or w/e, I just really want you to think about it. \nDo you believe that a whole <b> gender </b>just make things up for no reason whatsoever? Unless our goal was to be as comfortable as men in a certain area, what would our goal be? Especially when it comes to this. What we want is literally for men to NOT GIVE US FREE SHIT because we're female and also to not make sexist or creepy jokes when they find out we're female. How does this hurt you in any way and why would you ever oppose it unless you felt personally attacked by what we say? \n\nHow would you, as men, know better than sooo many women, what women experience in gaming? It's literally the same as with tinder. Ofc you don't feel offended that guys are disgusting as shit towards others when it not you they're disgusting towards. Yet, it's something literally every<b>  woman</b> on tinder, snapchat or whatever the social media/app has happen to them, aka suprise dick pics (the equivalent to dick pics irl is illegal, not sure why it's ok online), being called names and getting insults about our appearances when we reject them and rape & murder threats if we tell them what we think about their actions (offensive AF even when we don't actually believe they mean it). \nDo you deny these things aswell? Or is it just this one certain gaming thing that holds no truth?\nIf these other things happen, WHYYYY oh why would it be so amazing to you that this is a legit problem for us? \n\nI realize that I'm mainly talking to the type of men who would call women 'honey' as a way to patronize women when talking to them in this thread so I know for a fact that you're part of the problem and that's why you don't take notice when shit happens, you're probably the one doing it, not only here, but in games aswell.  If you believe as a man that you know what women have to endure without talking to actual women about it first, and taking in what they've said, you're the problem.

I fully recognize that men deal<b>  with </b>a crazy amount of pressure their whole life to provide for their families and women, that you get pushed down when you show feelings to the degree that a lot of men can't cry (and they even seem proud of it often times), that you're pushed to show your strength all your life and some of you become violent because of it. \nI realize more men commit suicide because of this, and lose custody of their children when they shouldn't because society seems to think that women are naturally closer to their children OR  that the men have been away working too much, trying to provide for their kids. I realize more men die at their jobs, because they do more dangerous work, because society expects them too, because \"men are strong\". I realize it's fucked how they still in many parts of the world still save women and children first, as if men have less of a value. I know men are raped and both physically and mentally abused a lot, and that they are too afraid to report it because they often times get disbelief and straigh up laughter. It's fucked up. I know. \nI've forgotten many things here obviously, but I just wanted to make you aware that I, and women like me, DO CARE. When we say we're about equality, most of us actually are, and are not about matriarchy. \nYou don't have to believe me ofc, but I really wish you could. And I really wish that you could also see that I'm n<b> ot bei</b>ng blind to your side of things only because I'm talking about problems WE experience. \nOurs and your problems are two sides of the same coin and even if I didn't personally care too much about men's problems, It would be really difficult not too since ours and yours so often are connected in different ways. \n\n\nI know this was rather off topic and one hell of a TL;DR, but I think it's important. With all this said, I fully respect that when it comes to men's issues, you know better than I do, for example what it's like growing up with the macho ideal being shoved down your throat, because I have nooo idea, even if I think I've witnessed it enough to know to a degree. I will never, since I've never been in that situation. \nIn that same way, you couldn't possibly know how often these things happen to girls in gaming and how much it bothers us. I know for a fact that you do not get the same thing. \nMaybe being scammed is not the same thing as being pursued by a creepy dude because he found out you're a girl. And it's not the same as being told/thought of straight away, that you suck at a game and should play support becaus<b> e of yo</b>ur gender. Ultimately because \"maybe being scammed\" by someone pretending to be a girl was your decision. Meaning, you actively decided to give a girl online something becaus<b> e of th</b>eir gender.  You shouldn't have. If you never did, no one would use that as a way to scam men.",

But has anyone thought that maybe th<b> e sexis</b>m is in there\u00a0to PROVE A POINT? Maybe hold a mirror up to society and show people how the world CAN and DOES work at times? Maybe art imitates life? Could it have been used, dare I say, SATIRICALLY? You know, instead of\u00a0the \"fuck women\" attitude?\n\nLook, I'm not saying that games CAN'T be offensive or bad.

The GTA players are, I reckon, mainly dudes. So because they used <b> a woma</b>n in bikini instead of a man in trunks, it's sexist. I thought it was rather sexist towards t<b> he wom</b>an in question by saying that.\n\n3) There are plenty of non important female npcs and non important male npcs. Just because the npcs that stand out your opinion are the hookers, housewives, whatever does not mean the game is sexist. And seriously, this \"non realistic view\" is actually not so unrealistic. I'm pretty damn sure there are a prostitutes in societies so I don't see how that's objectifying women. It's like saying because I mad<b> e a bl</b>ack male as a criminal in a game that I'm b<b> eing ra</b>cist. What the actual hell?\n\n4) A game's often not in any way related to reality, but simply inspired from reality. It has a lot of caricatures. In the first place, the media resorts to many different strategies to make money off celebrities, such as adultery and slander. Why are you so offended? Because the \"victim\"<b>  is a </b>woman? Second of all, it's a mother fucking game. Would you find it more fun to chase someone around the city, do risky things that you probably would never do in real life or make your character sit down on a chair and use the com<b> puter? </b>Common sense the former two are better.\n\n5) There are sexist characteristics in this game. And it's not just towards women. It's the internet, do you think that in real life people would go to your face constantly to tell you that you are wrong? No, they ignore you or confront you politely! In real life, people tend to flock with others that share the same opinion. On the internet, different opinions clash! And I haven't seen the review, but I do know that taking internet comments to justify a cause is immensely stupid and ridiculous. It's the internet, a place that is not respectful and very rude, and where people will not kiss your ass on everything you say.\u00a0\n\nImagination and creation shouldn't be limited by such crude limitations. By the way, people do not become video game characters. You do not become who you play and watch. We know it's an entertainment. You know what else? If a male Lara Croft was created, with the same characteristics as her, except male, no one, and I mean, no one would say he's a good role model. Saying video games are there as role models clearly shows your irrational thought on the unimportance of parents. Parents bring you up, not video games, not the media. Parents nurture you and your friends help make you become you. You know what doesn't? Your tastes for games and movies. This is the rule, and there are exceptions to every rules.",

But, BUT, I don't see the Grand Theft Auto games as just games, each one presents a theme that is apparent throughout the game, for instance: In GTA IV, Niko comes to America in pursuit of the American dream and the game's narrative reflects his trials. In GTA V, the theme is that the American dream has been reached and the decadent society in which the characters live is the prize- A society with gross <b> sexism </b>and corruption and crime everywhere. I don't think the game is sexist, in fact I could argue that even the marketing is poking at the people who actively contribute to the sexist society in which we live.

I think seeing as this is one of the fewer games where you can actually choose to be female online results in this being somewhat of a shocking revelation, in other popular online games such as COD for example I simply don't get this because unless I'm on mic no-one has any reason to treat me differently as they shouldn't because I'm just another player on the team, so why should they because I can on GTA?",

            "commentText": "No matter what you say about people saying \"women aren't playing real games\" when you say that 47% of all gamers are women, you're spouting a stupid statistic. Men who play games are less likely to refer to themselves as a 'gamer' if they play casually, while women who play the most casual games on and off like The Sims consider themselves among the elite of all gamers. There are no games companies actively excluding female gamers, whereas you're making it seem like there are.\n\nThere's an obvious difference between the mindset of each <b> gender </b>when it comes to gaming and historically, the main<b>  gender</b> of hardcore gamers is male. Only recently, ever since it's become 'cool' for women to play games and more 'acceptable' for anyone to do so, have the numbers of women gamers have increased.\n\nWomen are late to the game on this and developers make whatever they want, so why is there a need to pander to women because they don't like certain game<b> s Nobod</b>y complains that a Tarantino movie is too violent, because that's what they expect from it. So why complain abo<b> ut sexi</b>sm in GTA V? This is the series that glorified hiring prostitutes and then murdering them so you could get your money back, you should expect that sort of thing.\n\nThe poster girl from GTA V can also hardly be criticised, or you have to make the point that almost every single company u<b> ses </b>sex to sell. Check out any cologne or perfume ad, any clothing label (male or female) and even any soap advertisements. The problem isn't with gamin<b> g or se</b>xism, it's a proven formula continued by marketing departments simply because it works.\n\nAlso, the quoted messages are from people clearly from 4chan, which, from a simple search can be shown that was the case.\n\nJust lik<b> e th</b>e old men sitting in a room being forced to try accept games as a legitimate form of art, you're spouting wildly overstated tall tales to these people. Princess Zelda controlling Link, dressing up as a dude and saving him? Never happened. Since you're referring to Sheik, it's assumed that you're referring to OoT. Link's quest began before he ever met Zelda and everything required in story to give him the motivation was present before they met, too. Zelda only provided him the information about the Temple of Time and gave him the OoT and the means to travel to Death Mountain. This has gone for long enough, so I won't bother explaining Sheik's story in OoT, but will mention that you should know it and sure as hell shouldn't lie about it when you're trying to get people to take you seriously.",

But I only play the Online version of the game other than the story mode, due to the fact that I prefer a game with the option of choosing to play as a female. But I also think It's alarming, but also funny with the players/community of the online world. It's not just the males but females as well. There will be males who call you out for being a female giving statements such as, you must be playing on your brothers/bf's system, or I'M NOT LETTING YOU DRIVE CAUSE GIRLS ARE TERRIBLE DRIVERS! but there's also the female community who to me seems like they get offended when another female is in the lobby trying to \"fight\" for alpha female player in the all male lobby. Rarely do I find those beautiful people, male and female's who just want to play the game and have a good time no matter who they are with. It's Great. more players should be like that. I just wonder why is it that the type of <b> sex </b>you are interferes with these such of things? And I'm still waiting for that one day when Rockstar has a female story mode player.

            "commentText": "\"The men get something the women don't. Agency.\"\n\nExactly! And you know why? Because the story is about THEM, not the women. How is that sexist? If the story was about both them AND the women, then you'd have a point.\n\n\"Tell me, using\u00a0diagrams where appropriate, how putting a female character with amazing agency, grace, poise, and depth in your game would IN ANY WAY impact what you're trying to achieve in the story.\"\n\nGood point, but saying that the game is partly sexist for having 3 playable male characters is an extremely shallow insight. See my first point on why.\u00a0Also, just adding women to the game would make turn the game from good to great? How? If the characters are just as well written and fit into the story being told, what difference would that make?\n\n\"If they grow up looking at people from GTA V, they grow up into monsters.\"\n\nYeah, that's why it's rated M for MATURE AUDIENCES. People who are mature enough to know what's right and what's wrong. Is that too much to understand?!\n\nI'm not going to sit here and deny <b> sexism </b>exists in gaming, because it does. There are sexist assholes that believe women\u00a0shouldn't play games,\u00a0and that's despicable.\u00a0I WILL, however, say that just because a<b>  woman</b> isn't portrayed very well, or at all, doesn't automatically make it ant<b> i-woma</b>n or sexist, because that's\u00a0just as\u00a0ridiculous as saying The Little Rascals is an<b> ti-elder</b>ly because there's<b>  no elde</b>rly people in it, or Beauty and the Beas<b> t is ra</b>cist for not having any people of colour in it. See how stupid those arguments are?\n\nOverall, despite his good intentions, Paul did a pretty lousy job addre<b> ssing s</b>exism in gaming. Pretty disappointing.",

But then you have to look at this, as a gamer myself though in some of my games there are strong signs of <b> sexism,</b> you never really notice that because, shouldn't the game be played for the gameplay and storyline. Just like if the game is based around a strong female protagonist. One main example is mario on how princess peach always needs to be saved. Well I have friends who are female gamers and when I mentioned that, they said they never really cared since they played it for just the game that's all. My issue here is we put soo much time and effort into excluding females and mentioning on how sexist the entertainment world could be, but what if we put it simply as though<b>  sexism</b> does happen there are many games where it doesn't.",

This dogma introduces a bias, even if you aim for equality (which i believe is a genuine goal of most Feminists), you're turning a<b>  blind</b> eye towards a potential reciprocal inequality.

Single childless women make the same as single childless men. It's only when we include women with children we see a diference.\n\nBut since women chose to have children and to stop working full time or at all its obvious that is going to have an impact on their income.\nAs far as rape oficial statistics prove that they have dropped 80% in comparison with the last 4 decades. It's a decreasing crime and that proves things are getting better, not worse.\n\nIn the first world women do not have it bad or have it as bad as men. They are most certaily not discriminated against. The truth is feminists do not have a cause anymore. They have won and now they don't know what to do with their victory so they imagine a make-believe world that has <b> nothing </b>to do with reality.\n\nBy the way im a gamer and have lots of female gamer friends. I asked some of them if they felt games were sexist and not one of them said yes. Female gamers dont think games are sexist, SJW's and feminists do because they don't have any worthy causes left to fight anymore.",

The doors are open and no one but themselves is holding them back.\n\nYou've won. Women are in charge. You have more political power than men because you're the majority of voters. You have more economic power than men because 80% of consumer goods purchased are done so by women due to the fact that you have you money and your husbands, fathers and boyfriends money to spend. Women even do less time in jail for the same crime as a man and they're even talking about closing female prisions and letting everyone go because... vagina.\n\nThere is <b> nothing </b>left for you to do.

But i see feminists doing the oposite.\nI know for a fact that men do not have the same rights as women (paternity rights, genital mutilation, equality under the law, equal acces to education and healthcare). And i see feminists actually trying and succeding in preventing men to have access to these rights.\n\nI could go on and on on a list of complaints, but the only point that i want to make is saying that men have issues and problems does not mean that women dont have theirs too, equally important. And precisely because the most powerful and influential feminists wont recognize this and care only about women (or pretend to) i see feminism as oposite to equality of the sexes.\n\nTherefore i am an atifeminist.

Part of it is biological but another part is that men use less healtcare resources than women.\nMale specific diseases are less funded than female ones (breast cancer vs prostate cancer).\nMany health experts agree that if men used the healthcare available to them in the same way women do the average male life expectacy would raise up to 2 years.\n\nEducation. Until the 2nd half of the 20th century men had the advantage in academic sucess. Feminists at the time claimed ,and rightly so, that girls were being denied equal acess to schools and colleges.\nHowever sice then things have changed and now girls are by far doing much better than boys. There are colleges with a 70% to 30% ratio of women vs men.\nThere is a lack of balance here. And its not because there is a diference of IQ between men and women. Its because schools are so girl friendly that they have become boy unfriendly. Even i noticed that when i went to shool. Something is off with the education sistem and boys are being left behind (hopefully not on purpose).",

Some women have really ruined it for the rest of the world with fake feminism, and  the sexist lot of the men have have used this as an opportunity to fend the women's concerns away.\nYes,women don't play the so called \"real games\", as opposed to , say, candy crush, because straight women are not exactly into other women, and the latter has a sense of \"unisex-ness\" to it. the gaming industry is so heavily marketed towards men, its subconsciously fed into women's minds this is not for them.\n\nAnita Sarkesian is shit, but that doesn't change the fact that gaming industry is sexist.",

            "commentText": "Okay, a couple of thoughts I had during watching this include:\nThe game = / = the storyline in the game. The \"game is sexist\" is a blanket statement, where I think the correct statement should be, \"some of the characters, in the storyline, are sexist.\"\n\nHe implies that the world is a sand box but you \"cannot choose to be a prick\", as though it was a sand box-RPG, it isn't, it's a storyline based crime simulator. \"sand box\" only describes the gameplay mechanics, <b> nothing </b>else.\n\nHe then goes on to say the male characters have agency, when a great chunk of the missions are actually them, against their will, being manipulated into doing missions they don't want to do, showing they have no control/agency of their own.\n\nThem being \"redeemed\" is a strange phrasing, as there is<b>  nothing</b> to show them being redeemed, at all, in anyway. Not being caught = / = Being \"redeemed\"\n\nHe actively acknowledges all the characters in the storyline are monsters\nThere are as many moments that actively shame men, including the threatening of rape to JohnnyK, as well as possibly even raping Floyd.\n\nTrevor, himself, turned out to be suppressed by his mother, actually in love twice, & discourages the use of \"bitch\" around him.\nMichael's wife was just as unfaithful to him, as he was to her. Jimmy was as bad off as his sister, Tracey, only different.\nFranklin mourns the loss of his one-time girlfriend, to the point he still has a picture of them together, at his bedside, even though she's moved on/getting married.\n\nThis game is rated mature, & the storyline is very adult. Why should \"girls\" even be playing it? Is he saying he wants \"girls\" in the storyline itself? Children, in a GTA? He can't be serious.\n\n& finally, if he likes the idea of \"video games as art\", he can't hope to control the vision of the \"artist\". The people he knows who say the game isn't \"satire\" have no more a valid opinion than the \"artists\" who find their humor satirical.\n\nDid he really incite violence against people who question the statistics at the end?",

That mold as I've seen since Diablo 2 back in 1999 is literally those who fall back on being a girl to woo guys into giving them items, gear, helping them through things they can't do on their own.\n\nThe ones who are simply gamers, well, it's hard or impossible to tell them apart unless they point it out or you're on a VOIP while playing with them. Most of them I've known won't admit to being female publicly in competitive gaming because of how heavily they're raged at and called liars because a guy's ego can't handle being owned by a female. lol\n\nAnd yeah, there's a lot of <b> sexism </b>in gaming... some has a viable place, but not all. I belong to a large gaming community (over 1000 members) and a lot of those I've met and talked to are female and many of them agree with the two paragraphs I put above. Even had a couple laugh at me on Teamspeak, them admit they're a gamer girl because they'll start prodding their boyfriend/husband/other guys to help them out. On the other foot, there's a couple I talk to regularly that continually school others in BF4 and the WvWvW of Guild Wars 2.",

I was very pleased with the whole video, and <b> sexism </b>is a real issue in the gaming industry.\nThere's a lot of comments on here trying to defend the POV of men in the gaming world. How there's<b>  nothing</b> wrong with their male characters and how it bashes all of the characters. However, that it does not do so equally is the point. When women are harshly verbally abused and their jobs threatened simply for stating tha<b> t sexis</b>m exists in this media? That's when you know something is wrong. It's true women are devalued and dehumanised in some of these games.\nAnd if you don't believe in rape culture then you have never truly talked to<b>  a wom</b>an who has been raped by someone she trusted and thought loved her, put down by her parents and told it is her fault when men assault her, told the way she dresses or talks or the things she likes are wrong.\nMy point is, just because you don't see examples of these things daily, as they happen, doesn't mean they aren't there. These are important issues and addressing them one step at a time is the only way to go. Because our society is too set in its ways to take it down all at once.",

            "commentText": "My humble two cents. Rockstar have repeatedly featured female leads and supporting characters in their games, who show actual personality traits, character growth and aren't just there to make goo-goo eyes at the male leads. The lack of such female characters in GTA V is odd, but not sexist. Including a female character for the sole reason of '<b> gender </b>equality' or pointing out the lack of such is just as sexist.\n\nLastly, the accusation isn't quite accurate. Michael's wife, Amanda, is a reasonably strong character. She does not simply exist to enable Michael; quite the opposite, she actively berates him for his terrible behaviour. She has her own motivations and has redeeming qualities. I don't believe the game is sexist, as nearly EVERY character is portrayed negatively, and the semi-redemption of the male leads is as a result of them being main characters, not because of their<b>  gender</b>. Imagine the backlash if Trevor had been <b> a woma</b>n.",

Having not played GTA4 I can't say anything about that, but no previous GTA game has had any notable female character that comes to mind. Also, I think a female Trevor would have been very welcome. Isn't he strong, and independent, and active? His behaviour is very male coded, so a female doing the same things would be kinda cool. Like, why can only male characters behave like that?",

                    "commentText": "@45calGunslinger\u00a0I think I get your point there, it's one that has always intrigued me about <b> gender </b>equality.\n\nLet's put things like this : in your group of 8 workers, whose work is building cupboards, the law says you have to hire 4 men and 4 women. How cool, this law makes women and men equals, yay!\nBut what if there are 6 men wanting this awesome cupboard-making job, who are all better for this job than the 5 postulating women? It means 2 men won't get the job they deserve for the sake of<b>  gender</b> equality?\nBut then, is this really what you can call equality? Doesn't that even become sexist towards men, since women are priviledged?\n\nIn the same way, I feel like it isn't fair to always urge the use of more female leaders in movies, games, etc.\nDon't get me wrong, there is a part of truth in everything Paul Verhoeven says. But the solution t<b> o sexis</b>m is not as simple as filling quotas of 50/50. And an underrepresentation of women in a game doesn't make me think the developers are sexists, because it must be the case for some of them, but you can't tell with such observations.\u00a0\n\nAlso it's been said that videogames are now more and more labeled as work of art. Hell, to some extent, let the devs create the characters they want, if they feel like having 3 dudes as main protagonists, I don't see why they'd be like \"Hm.. Forget it, we have to include<b>  a wom</b>an here.\". In the same way that painting only male subjects rarely is an issue to anyone.\n\nActually, I think r<b> eal gen</b>der equality would be the complete unawareness of differences between women & men. Like perceiving everybody either as hermaphrodites or asexual beings. Because a character being cool because \"damn, it<b> 's a w</b>oman, it's uncommon\", is also sexist. A character should be awesome because of his being, but regardless o<b> f his g</b>ender.\n\nA female Trevor shouldn't be perceived as better than a male Trevor, or the opposite, because we should just find Trevor's personnality the exact same in both cases.\nWhat makes us think one or the other is better is because of all the thoughts we already have about what it is to be a man and what it is t<b> o be a</b> woman, thoughts we've been raised to think.\nSo I don't think we can reach that complete equality, but we can still try to come closer to it.\n\n(That being said, I'd find the idea of a new GTA with a bad-ass female main character, litterally kickin' balls, awesome.)\n\n(And sorry if I made some mistakes, English isn't my native language.\nAnd I'll feel<b>  pret</b>ty dumb if you tell me I totally missed your point.\nAnyway, it became more a statement of my own vision than one of yours.)",

Most notably the constant undertone that adding women to video games etc will someone how improve the quality, which is only objectively true from the perspective that it promotes equality, where in a creative scenario, the <b> gender </b>of a hero should be chosen based on the personality and story of your hero. Further to that point, there are clearly some heros in EVERY media form that would have been better depicted with the opposite<b>  gender</b>. It's also a terrible idea to use GTA as an example point for video-gam<b> e sexis</b>m, due to the fact that the sole aim for grand theft auto is to be distasteful and confronting in its disregard for racial/sexual equality, and to at times amplify the class gaps in modern times to bizarre extremes. It is not a good game for proving any point except how tasteless humans as a total can be. He also neglects to touch at all on the fact that video ga<b> me sexi</b>sm is a v<b> ery </b>old \"culture\" based on the fact that at one point in time women were the minority in online gaming, and where as that has moved onto balance, the gaming mentality has missed a few beats. Instead of really discussing this with any merit he lots angry gamers into derogatory stereotypes and creates a null pendulum effect to just insult the other body of gamers. In reality, very few of these people are truly harmful people, more often a combination of idiots and elitists who determine that playing games on any platform other than their prefered platform means it is not a \"proper game\" instead of really addressing the mentality behind it, he says \"feel free to hit them\" In reality, platform elitism is an issue totally irrelevan<b> t to se</b>xism, as its normally an opinion impressed on ANYBODY who will listen.\u00a0\n\nRealistically speaking, a lot of debate and butting heads of feminism in gaming is almost null, there is a problem undoubtedly, but I believe people generally redirect the issue<b>  into</b> dumb shit that isn't realistically a problem. IE the girl on the GTA cover. Yes, they sold the game with a pi<b> ece </b>of sex appeal thrown in, of course they do, everyone does, and its no bigger issue than the topless pictures of Taylor Lautner used to promote Twilight. All these things do is steal attention from legitimate concerns like the discrimination against female gamers in online communities, and the disturbingly low number of games being created to fulfil a female fantasy.\n\u00a0(that said in the context of a stereotypical war game fulfilling masculine notions of fighting and heroics and badarsery etc, and as a counter to this there are very few games released with a purpose of creating a world with the intention of drawing in and engaging a female audience.)\n\n\ngetting too long endrant.",

In environments where the game is based off of historical events, WWII genres and the like, it displays policy and the mindset that women are not combat capable, and therefore do not deserve warrior/solider status, and therefore will not be seen as people killed by war, despite women being combat-capable, and also numerous casualties. \n\nIn games where combat is not based after any particular event, devs and players find it far more plausible that women would only fulfill the role of sexy computer-program sidekick than warrior, even with super-space armor. In the cases where there is A single <b> woman </b>who fights, she is usually the exception. It's very rare that you'll find bots, friend or foe, that will be women. Which is stupid, cause we make up over half the population and all that jazz. One of the few surprising examples was the first Bioshock, which actually had enough forethought to realize \"hey, if the plan is to live in rapture for the rest of our lives, we're probably not going to have a 100% sausage fest down here.... What does that look like after everyone gets underwater cabin fever?\"",

            "commentText": "So this guy who hosts a rubbish kids TV show in Australia, who doesn't like the big bang theory :s, the majority of your points about GTAV were invalid. if you know the GTA franchise, you shouldn't play GTAV and be surprised, if you want to play a game with women as lead characters play a different game & story. More females are gaming, and as this population increases to an equal amount, then the game designers will start to craft their games to fit the market. But when Rockstar look at their market research and it says males are 75-80% of their audience they will make it to suit that audience. you end by saying \"to those stupid smelly boys\" as if this is the gaming population, it might be the type of people who still read/comment on gamespot, but if you go to any of the major gaming events, certainly in the EU you clearly don't understand the gaming audience and I'm not sure how being the host of \"steampunk\" qualifies you to comment.",

Every Story about men ever, had a good balance between the 2 sides( usually good and evil). So for every awesome guy there would be a not so awesome guy to balance it out.\u00a0\nYou don't even need a female lead, that's so beyond the point. I play as a dude \u00a0most of the time anyway. But the fact that there is no balance between the characters(female) whatsoever, that's what keeps most(not all) women gamers at bay. So it's only natural that their main audience would be men.\u00a0\n(PS. I find it very pathetic that some guy gamers love their nude, stupid and simple women with big breasts so much, that they would insult anyone who tries to point out that it may be insulting. I would love to enjoy these great games more, but it just takes a bit of the fun out of it.)",

There's a difference between making a joke and trying to marginalising people. I was talking to my friend, CloudCuckooCountry, about this. he is far more eloquent\u00a0then I am and this is what he had to say:\n\n\"\n\nThe difference is in what Derrida called the absent presence.\n\nAn absent presence at its simplest understanding is a part of the text left unsaid, but which the implications of the text led back to. In the case of marginalization, the absent presence is a hierarchical power differential (as in; that one particular group of people is somehow objectively superior or inferior to another group of people).\n\nFor example: if I were to make a joke about women, I would never explicitly say that 'Women are stupider than men, women are inferior to men, women are\u2026 etc' but the contents of my joke may contain a type of wording or a turn of phrase that makes an implication. And the implication turns a statement like 'women are stupider than men' from something which is unsaid to an absent presence; something which is said in subtext, something which is brought into the conversation as a truth, without anyone declaring it to be a truth.\n\nIf I were to make a joke, any joke, the person listening should be able to tell me what grand narrative I've implied without explicitly saying it. As such, I (a man) can make a joke about women (the other, in the context of me) and imply a grand narrative (masculine superiority) and thus make a marginalizing joke. In such a case, even if I never explicitly disrespect women, someone would be justified in calling me out as a sexist.\n\nThat's not to say that all jokes about <b> sex </b>or<b>  gender</b> are sexist. It's possible to make a joke abou<b> t se</b>x <b> or gend</b>er that doesn't contain an absent presence which invokes a hierarchical power differential. But you need to analyze the joke before you can declare whether or not it contains this.\n\nP.S. There's also explicit marginalization, but that's far more blatantly obvious to identify. I'm assuming your concern is when someone justifies marginalization by dismissing it as 'just a joke'.\n\n\"\n\nCloud was talking about making sexist jokes vs making jokes ab<b> out gen</b>der but the argument is the same for any joke that could be offensive. The \"absent presence\" that was left unsaid by this video is that\u00a0Paul Verhoeven is a gamer himself and doesn't believe that the stereotypes he joked about are prevalent.",

I'm not actually offended, as I said the last time, I'm offering a critique to the presenter on how to better get his message across in future presentations.
