There are over 60's today who will almost certainly outlive those under thirty because of the former's healthier lifestyle. \"Leeds...a place of terribly intelligent young people...\" - What - all the <b> old </b>people are of low intelligence, are they? From where did the young people acquire their brains? Are there no thickies among the under 30's, then? Intelligence is fine, but it's a poor substitute for experience and its acquired knowledge.
