Globalists have no morals and no values, all they care about is total global domination for their ideology and the handful of elitist families who push their agenda on humanity. \n\nShame on the international banksters, I hope they fail completely in their attempt to coerce the diverse groups of people into global bondage. Shame on Soros, shame on Rothschilds, shame on Rockefellers, you will not get achieve the global domination you have been working towards. The nations will persevere and the people you indoctrinated will be free once again. Without these globalist elites mankind would be much better off.",

Let's go way out west and see what it means! I think this 'survey' (sarcasm drips here!) really is a divisive attempt at pushing a 'we and they' attitude, whereas most Australians understand the terrible past but think we are better off moving on to an inclusive future without divisively teaching the progeny of our forefathers a debilitating outlook of what a past, they have no physical connection with, could have on our united future if we were all one in a mature <b> nation!</b> Australia may have a grey past, but our future is better than those who forecast doom and gloom on the basis of past generations!",

When I compete against an Aboriginal, I struggle with one hand tied behind my back.

I get put down<b>  and not</b>hing I do can change that because <b> of my ethn</b>icity/skin colour.  That also makes Aboriginals racists.

Think if you were one of them and you have to deal with the fact everyday that someone came over and took over your home land, raped your people and murdered them. Now you are lower class citizen on your own territory and still struggling. Wouldn't it be some what of a nice thing for the people who stole their land to give them some jobs? It is not their fault they are \"less intelligent\" at all maybe some of them didn't have access to good education like the whites did. If you were aboriginal how would you feel about people doing all this to you and then the same people being mad that you can now get special jobs to help you earn some money. I am american and i personally believe this is sad treatment its exactly like they did the native americans over here",

Talking about the percentage of aboriginal blood is really just <b> racist.</b> The fact is that these peoples family and relatives had a horrible past, and they do not want the day their country was invaded and their people killed and relocated to be celebrated. The end.",

In January 1788 the First Fleet landed and there was no conflict until several months later - if the majority of Aboriginals did not want them to settle, they could have easily wiped out the entire British settlement. 2. It is not <b> racist </b>to talk about racial heritage and bloodlines, Aboriginals do it themselves all the time. 3. Both<b>  black</b> and white people were killed - in fact it is estimated that between mid 1788 and 1934 around 20,000 Aboriginals and 2,500 whites died. 4. Hundreds of thousands of Aboriginals died from the unintentional introduction of diseases like smallpox, and not from any war. 5. Less than 30,000 Aboriginal children comprised the \"stolen generation\", but over the same period 250,000 white children were also \"stolen\" by government agencies. But we don't hear about that....because th<b> e racis</b>t Aboriginal biased narrative in this country only allows for Aboriginals to have suffered. No not the end - not by a long chalk, because it won't matter what day we celebrate as Australia day, there will always be 'Aboriginals' named Sven, choosing to ignore their 93.75% Swedish heritage, just so they can whine about \"surviving the invasion\".",

The first settlers were greeted by Aboriginals with raised spears, and had the Aboriginals wanted them dead, they would have easily killed them all. 200 flintlock muskets against many thousands of spears would have been no contest. The real truth is that the vast majority of Aboriginals died from Smallpox and other diseases accidentally introduced in 1788, not by an invasion or battle. There was no invasion, it is just a load of garbage from people trying to re-write history to vilify current day white-skinned Australians.",

The truth is that there is a higher percentage of aboriginal people unemployed and homeless than white australians and we are only now banding together to improve this.

Aboriginal people have a reason they won't to change it, yet you and so many others have no reason not to change it.",

I'm talking about if the Peoples Republic of China colonised Australia. (Which they are doing now using soft power) China has no history of genocide because it never had the technology to explore. Indigenous people in Anglo countries are free and live in some of the greatest countries in the world. Australia would be under the rule of an authoritarian state that oppresses it's own people. The Chinese came to Africa as individuals not as an expedition representing the Chinese government. The Chinese in Africa today are also not well liked. You must be aware that only about a month ago President Xi of China threatened military action and subsequent invasion of the free people of Taiwan.",

No. Could they sail to India? Yes. Could they conquer India? No. Did they avoid conquering India because they're just sooo sweet and nice? No. Did they have the capability of conquering India or Africa? No. Geography plays a role too. The Europeans only had to sail the Atlantic not the pacific. They arrived on a continent that was almost empty. Was India empty? No. If the Chinese were capable of sailing to North America do you think they would have handed out presents? Hitler waltzed through Europe, but was stopped at England. English power? No. England is an island. Geography. Can the Chinese project power globally today? No. Can the U.S.? Yes. You have this incredible belief that White people are evil and non Whites have this goal to pet puppy dogs, and collect butterflies.",

Just because these white \"non-aboriginals\" where not around back then does not mean they weren't affected by the history. Their grandfathers were stripped from their mothers and that gets to them. Their way of life was pushed out by foreigners. Live with the burden of your family's past and then tell me you don't feel a connection with your loved ones and a need to rekindle. By your definition, saying they are not aboriginal is to pretend their family members and their struggles simply never existed. That is simply pitiful and disgraceful.",

My parents came here with $300 and they worked their asses off, built a house, raised 2 kids (me and my bro) and are now retired. We worked and fought hard to have a place to call home, we didn't steal anything from anyone and if anyone says that to me I'm going to tell them to shut the f**k up. Want to see how people are treated differently because of <b> race?</b> Visit a Centrelink and see all their forms. We're all asked if we're of 'Aboriginal / Torres Strait island descent and as long as there are 2 people under 2 flags who want to be treated differently we will never have true reconciliation no matter how many apologies white people make for the past. COUNTRIES have flags, PEOPLE DO NOT. No one is talking about the handouts that the government gives aboriginals, free housing and other things like that. Or the high rates of physical and<b>  sexual</b> abuse or the alcoholism and drug use and other issues. Let's talk about all of that too. While we're at it let's talk about some of the Aboriginal justice system quirks like spearing each other in the leg as a form of punishment. Or payback (a system which is still practiced) Or the tribal warfare and fighting that existed BEFORE British colonization. Let's have a discussion about that eh? And if you honestly believe that Aboriginal society was a land of peace between everyone and all the tribes before Captain Cook got here then I've got a bridge to sell you... It's in Sydney and it's quite nice. Going cheap lol :)",

Based on some of the arguments out there, any day of the year could be considered 'Invasion Day', and no, I'm not talking about the 200 year occupation of England by Rome, or the  viking/norman invasions of England. I'm talking about Australia. This current movement is starting to remind  me a little bit of Christianity, everybody is born in sin and guilt due to actions of their  ancestors, and we must all feel perpetually ashamed, taking as many opportunities as possible to virtue signal our morality.\n\nHowever, I'm not in the business of wanting indigenous Australians' to feel unwelcome on their own lands, that is not right. We need to remove the over-the-top people from both sides, and have a reasonable conversation about a day in which we can all celebrate a great (and trust me, it is by all world measurements) country. What is an 'Indigenous proposed day for a celebration? I emphasize celebration here. If no such day can be found, then why change the date?  Indigenous people to to feel bound to the day, I'm not sure how to achieve this though/",

            "commentText": "If the civilization of Australian Aboriginal people was really that great and magnificent, their technologies should at least be advanced enough to allow them to defend themselves from the British Invasion, or even if they could not stop Europeans from invading their land, their authority should at least find effective strategies to cope with the new situation brought up by foreign invasion, and to initiate domestic reforms, just like what the authorities in Japan and China did when they were facing foreign invasion in 19th century. Yet the reality was the aboriginal community achieved neither of them. It is difficult to believe that they occupied a land for millions of years, yet their societies never became sophisticated enough to develop the concepts of 'country' and 'sovereignty ' as the peoples of almost all other continents did. It was only after all of their land was claimed by the British(since <b> nobody </b>claimed sovereignty on this land before), that the Aboriginal people began to realize that the failure to establish a country of their own was a big mistake. These facts not only indicate that the aboriginal people of Australia are extremely primitive, backward, and stupid when it comes to modern technologies, but also indicate they are extremely backward, primitive, and stupid when it comes to social structure.",

This concept became offical in 1951 called the assimilation policy, where all aboriginal families were forced to give up there children and assimilate them into 'white society,' this was discontinued in 1969 but there were already many biracial children and they were much lighter than their parents or grandparents. Now that you know there's no need to ask why light skinned people are talking about how they're aboriginal or why they aren't fully aboriginal.",

The Indians have no rights to land in the United States , only if they serve in the military can they own land . That's a shame. The Indians only get a percentage of the gambling . Otherwise they live like slaves on a reservation. They have no hope and most just get drunk, at least the ones I have seen and talk to. When the government made treatise and made them give up there guns the were promised Land and told them to become farmers. This is just like Aborigines. I'm by no means saying I'm responsible for what happened in the past. Same as I'm not responsible for what the south did to slaves,  I haven't owned a slave so the past is the past. But the Indians should be able to buy land . Same as the aboriginals. This is why we have a Constitution and a second amendment.",

For the record - I`ll listen to you, I`ll listen to Sven and I`ll listen to full blooded aboriginal people to make up my mind. Unlike some, I won't discriminate against anyone who has a different point of view. From the evidence that I`ve gathered I truly believe that Australia was colonised but also invaded. I also believe that a lot of history books, (but not all)  written by white australians, particularly those written in earlier 1900`s deliberately left out numerous massacres and mistreatment of aboriginal people.                           I think we you and I differ is our definition of \"invasion\". I remember reading one of your previous posts where you commented about numbers, and that the aboriginal people far out numbered the white arrivals back in 1788 and that there wasn't enough numbers to invade.                                          Thats a good point. My view is that there was on invasion and it took place over a number of years, even a number of decades. Unlike other invasions, this invasion wasn't an all out war on the whites arrival back in 1788 but a slow and deliberate invasion that the aboriginal people still haven't fully recovered from today. Again I mention slavery, stolen generations, slaughter and driven from their lands. All actions that occur when peoples lands are invaded. i`m surprised your not getting that!",

Bryce himself concedes this subject remains a \"debate\" because he accepts that history is susceptible to error and exaggeration (as I assert is the case), but he also concludes that oral accounts from centuries past are reliable - when it suits his stance. I question his impartiality because of his obviously duplicity in this regard.\r\n\r\n2. Is just the original article that was reprinted as 1 on your list, - but look at the language used \"unequivocally support the idea\" - That's just an unequivocal collection of non-committal terms designed to create the illusion of evidence and truth, but in actual fact it is just weasel words for \"this is what we want you to think, but we have no real evidence to support it\". \r\n\r\n3. I'm not going to dignify that <b> communist </b>rag with any comment other than - \"Are you seriously citing this<b>  commie</b> buIIshite?\" Come on Ocean Runner, I thought we were having an adult conversation.\r\n\r\n4. ARRRRGH - The Guardian. Oh dear, so you are quoting a renowned buIIshit rag that quotes another article by itself, which concludes that there were some 6000 attacks (massacres) killing some 65,000 aboriginals JUST IN QLD, of which 57% were at the hands of \"Native Police\" i.e. Aboriginals in police uniform. So they were slaughtered by other Aboriginals! Hmmmm....The numbers don't add up either! Even if there were 750,000 aboriginal people in 1788, it's estimated that at least 70% or 525,000 were decimated by diseases like smallpox, TB, measles etc, which leaves only 225,000. A toll of 65,000 just in QLD alone would have represented total annihilation nationally - which we KNOW is not true. This is my point - any logical analysis of these myths and numbers proves them to be exaggerated drivel and lies.\r\n\r\n5. You can't be serious Ocean Runner? According to this cretinous drivel, the settlers polluted the water, and killed off the kangaroo population within months of arrival, resulting in aboriginal people being close to starvation. Hahahaha - I've read some biased idiotic self-serving buIIshite in my time, but this takes the cake.\r If you believe the crap on this website to be true then there is no hope for you.\n\r\nOcean Runner, I'm glad you are looking around for information, but if you can't tell the difference between chocolate cake and a prairie cake, then you're destined to swallow a whole lot of buIIshite in life.\r\n\r\nI'm fortunate to have lived long enough to have visited the Aboriginal Tent Embassy on the lawns at<b>  (ol</b>d) Parliament House, when it was our Parliament House in the 1970's. The change in stories, vernacular, demands and expectations between then and now is dramatic. \"Sven\" is now a machine - a very well educated and highly funded machine. They're not just about representing Aboriginal interests anymore, they are manipulating any opportunity for political and financial advantage. It is now a business...an industry in fact. \"Sven\" have manipulated legions of white self-flagellating \"useful idiot\" naive uni students to do their bidding for them. Read between the lines and do the simple math to expose \"Sven's\" buIIshite. Simple math and a modicum <b> of comm</b>on sense exposes their lies and manipulation.",

Hmmm - proof when it suits, but untruthful when it doesn't. Stinks of double-standards to me.

                    "commentText": "@Peter Hobbs Mate. I said many of the documents written by white settlers refused to admit they invaded Australia but not all. Original journals have been investigated. One in particular was the journal of Governor Lachlan Macquarie. In his own words openly talks about the massacres of aboriginal people in one particular area. It's in the third link I provided you. Read the following extract - \"On 9 April 1816, Macquarie secretly instructed crown troops to hunt down and massacre Aboriginal people. Writing in his journal the following day, Macquarie noted that he had 'ordered three Separate Military Detachments to march into the Interior and remote parts of the Colony, for the purpose of Punishing the Hostile Natives, by clearing the Country of them entirely \u2026'\nHe further recorded that he had 'directed as many Natives as possible be made Prisoners' and that any resisters were to be killed and their bodies hung from trees 'in order to strike the greatest terror in the Survivors'.\n\nDuring Macquarie's war, which continued until November, the bodies of slain warriors were decapitated and their heads sent to museums in Europe. Aboriginal 'prisoners of war' were transported to penal colonies in Tasmania. Aboriginal children were removed from their families for 're-education'. And British settlers were granted permission to shoot and kill Aboriginal people who were deemed to have violated the various proclamations issued by the colonial government. These are all results of an undeniable invasion. it's written in <b> black </b>and white from a white man in a position of power. To deny an invasion is just ridiculous. There are many other instances where similar massacres occurred where white settlers forced aboriginal people off their lands.",

For starters the Native Police you mention as part of your argument weren't formed until the mid 1800`s, some 50 to 60 years after the settlement date. So going by your own argument, (which I personally disagree with) you cannot include this as it was too far after the settlement date. By your own words (not mine) \"You can't have it both ways\"                 \u00a0\n\nAnother point you fail to admit, is that the formation of the native police was also forced upon the aboriginal people. It was really a case of become the attackers or the defenders and be driven off your lands and quite possibly slaughtered (see Governor Lachlan Macquarie journal).                                                               \u00a0\n\nTo this day there is real evidence of over 120 massacres dating back to 1788. Governor\u00a0Arthur Phillip\u00a0wrote in his own journal in 1791 that he granted ex-convicts allotments of land at\u00a0Prospect Hill\u00a0and\u00a0The Ponds. He made entries in his journal that he also gave them authorisation to shoot Aboriginal Australians in the area to drive\u00a0them away from their lands. The very definition of an invasion there. Hello???\u00a0                                                       \u00a0\n\nAnother point I`d like to raise to you is the various definition of the word invasion. Most describe it as the taking over of land by force. No where in any definition is there a time limit. You seem so confused here thinking that if it wasn't quick and immediate it wasn't an invasion. Showing a lack of experience here Hobbsy. Once again, just a little naive on your behalf. Happy to educate you on more when you're ready pal. Just try and be just a little open minded pal.",

I think you're just one of those<b>  old</b<b> > racis</b>t guys, stuck in their ways that can't accept when they're wrong.   Shame. your loss though! \n\nTo be perfectly honest, I was actually once like you. I refused to believe a lot of these things, I`d argue against them just like you do now, but after doing more research I actually changed my opinion and views. Something I doubt you could ever bring yourself to do pal.\u00a0\n\nThe bottom line is that this topic is about changing the date of Australia day which I support. Many see it as invasion day which I also support and agree with. I also believe that one day this date will be changed which I'll also support.\u00a0\n\nIn the end, it doesn't really matter that you refuse to accept these facts.",

It's time to get with the 21st century and accept that Australia is no longer dominated by aboriginals, like native americans..who are finally taking some steps towards making some real income with gaming casinos.

When I learnt abt the aborigines & saw a bit of their culture (very little bit actually) here n there, I was very surprised to learn that just like there r native Americans, there r native Australians too. & I was also sad at the same time to learn how these ppl don't share d same status as d local whites. & How they hv to fight for their rights..on their own soil. & For what..cos they aren't white..? It was sad to see how d only evidence of their present existence were found only in souvenir shops (& those very rare aborigines selling their art on streets). & d only time when I saw them take centre stage was during d 2018<b>  common</b> wealth games events where performers from dif<b> f commo</b>n wealth countries had come to perform (including from India) & ofcourse Australia needed something to show d world too.. seemed  like it was one of those rare platforms for these native ppl to tell d world abt d injustice happening to them & they did not let it go, despite d atmosphere being fun n positive. But are they to blame? It got me thinking. My heart goes out to them.",

Why can't we just all celebrate together, as a whole, instead of going against it and trying to make everyone feel guilty??

Personally, I think Australia Day should be moved to another day because I can understand how these people feel waking up on a day where most of the <b> nation </b>is celebrating the amazing country Australia is, while they're feeling guilty and sad as this day marks the death of so many of their ancestors. The genocide was awful, and I think for the sake of the unfortunate timing, Australia Day should be moved.",

God  built his kingdom and for many many years he tried he created many forms of animals to make it all work for instance he created fish to clean the seas, he created cows and chickens, he created four legged beats of the fields to work in the fields, but after some time he realized gods kingdom just would not work without gods actual spirit within the kingdom itself. So created Adam and eve and breathed life into them and breathed gods own spirit into onto them. He created his own special people known as the Awdawn. Aka Adam. He gave all of this world to his blessed Awdawn people (white people) and in return asked us to live in his image. So he sent us all around gods kingdom to every part of it to civilize and grow fruitful and manage gods kingdom in his own image. This is what we have done we have invented and constructed beyond belief. Infrastructure, space travel, electricity.. etc. This is because God gave us a soul and a spiritual energy that never ends. You on the other hand were created a long time before us back when all of the animals were made. You were made without soul and without the mind power to do the things we have. God gave you the brains to do your job. Work some fields and basically your here to do a job and part of the animal catergory. Some of you are hybrids dating back to when Cain bred to a female beast of the field after drinking alot of alcahol,  slightly more open minded only still without a soul or any kind of spirituality or connection to God apart from what from you were created for.. you don't realize it but the happiest place for you is to be where God originally placed you! Working for Adam and Eve's descendants in our fields. So you need to understand that we did not steal anything from you! God gave us this kingdom! And you will never know the true happiness that God intended for you also until you return to what God made you for. And I'm sorry but you cant blame us gods chosen special people to be like him for what God has made and how God has made it. The problem lies within you! Your trying to be something your not! God made you with 4 legs! Yet you forced your descendants to stand up onto your 2 back legs so as to copy us, God placed you in the field yet you continuously run off from it and try to live among us, you will never be happy trying to be something your not.",

Without a prison, there can't be no delinquents. We had no locks nor keys therefore among us there were no thieves. When someone was so poor that he couldn't afford a horse, a tent or a blanket, he would, in that case, receive it all as a gift. We were too uncivilized to give great importance to private property. We didn't know any kind of money and consequently, the value of a human being was not determined by his wealth. We had no written laws laid down, no lawyers, no politicians, therefore we were not able to cheat and swindle one another. We were really in bad shape before the white man arrived and I don't know how to explain how we were able to manage without these fundamental things that (so they tell us) are so necessary for a civilized society.'",

I celebrate ANZAC Day just like every other Australian, despite my great-grandad being killed in Gallipoli. Do I sit here and say why are we celebrating tragedy? We lost many lives that day why do we call ANZAC Day a celebration? I look at the positives of history, yes people died including my own blood but in the long run the Battle of Gallipoli formed Australia for what it is today. We take pride in our sacrifices in war and we celebrate them. I understand what happened to the Aboriginal people on the 26th and onward but I believe as a country we need to look at the positives. Yes what happened was terrible, yes <b> racist </b>white people came over and did<b>  racist</b> things, but in the long run that formed a country and that country Australia is the greatest country in the world. No matter what date Australia Day is celebrated on, people will always complain, if you want equality than every persons voice is meant to be heard at the same level, no matte<b> r rac</b>e, religion, social position etc. so in reality the minority of people who want the date of Australia Day to be changed should not justify the whole decision for simply being the Indigenous people of this land. We mourn over the sad history of this country and celebrate the future of this beautiful country and the generations to come. This day has always been controversial and unfortunately it always will be as over this subject there is no date that all 24 million people will agree on. Why can't we just come together, put aside our differences and together celebrate this beautiful country on the 26th of January.",

Give all employed aboriginal people a public holiday to burn effigies of Arthur Philip at locations of their choice\n\nNow lets have a reality check. Here in the Territory, easily the largest percentage of ATSI people in Australia, they dont even include First Australians in the official unemployment figures because it would make our beloved Top End look like the welfare state it is. Highest rates of infant mortality, incarceration, domestic violence, <b> alcohol </b>and drug abuse and the list goes on - again, said statistics are only trotted out when the 'blackfella lobby' wants to make a political point and ensure funding. How many billions of white man's guilt money is it going to take to turn this around ? Imagine growing up in a family where no-one (including cousins, uncles and aunts) had an income other than social welfare payments - that's not even remotely sustainable and its at the heart of the problem. If you place no value on schooling your kids, how do you expect them to get jobs ? I cant fix it any more than I can fix the brutality meted out to aboriginal people, particularly here in the Top End of Australia, but the welfare state is doing them no favours whatsoever - when the crunch comes, and it will, aboriginal people will wonder who turned the tap off.",

Once stolen from there families, if they were to speak about there culture, they were punished. The aim was the breed out the culture, the <b> race,</b> the communities.  That's why there are so few \"full\" aboriginal people.

That is a massive issue we face as <b> a natio</b>n. Please, you are obviously little educated about the topic. Be educated, not opinionated.  100%, 50% or 5%, you are aboriginal it does not matter the colour of your skin.

What benefits do you think they get? Do you mean the lower life expectancy, higher mortality rate, higher rates of incarceration, high number of deaths at birth and higher rates of disease? Rightly so they get benefits since they only had the right to vote about 50 years ago which was only a generation ago probably in your or your parents lifetime.

Which makes sence, as it was safe to stay within the tribe. Like all of the ancient world thousands of years ago, conflict and violent barbarism, was everywhere,<b>  ..nothi</b>ng like the safe havens offered to Aborigines to live in today.\n\nOver the thousands of years, there was three big major waves, of \u2018colonisers' who came down from the direction of India, that landed on Australia, with no doubt many smaller ones in between.\nEach time different people came into Australia, they came into conflict where they bumped into people that where already there.\n\nThe same welcome the British had, from the Aborigines, is what thousands of years ago, the oncoming wave of peoples, would have had when they came across the peoples settled before them.\n\nThere was a constant state of war between dominant tribes, and the smaller tribes would submit to the Dominant ones.\n\nThe weaker tribes acquired protection from the stronger tribes, and possibly given areas where they would be allowed to hunt. The dominant tribes enjoyed the privilege of being able to take women from the weaker tribes, as well as water from their wells, and any hunting grounds they chose.\n\nUnder their own laws, which was <b> the com</b>mon laws of nature, ....the weaker tribe submits to the more dominant tribes, so they would have willingly submitted to the British, once it was obvious they were stronger!\n\nNot a bad deal really!\n\nThey were brought up to modern civilisation, which took thousands of years to create, by European white men.\nA unique evolution, through technology, art, inventions, wars and many other struggles to achieve!\n\nAll the free stuff that's thrown at Aborigines now, is not appreciated, especially not by the ungrateful brainwashed, entitled SJW's, who act like they speak for the majority of Aborigines, in this video.\n\nDon't let the lies and half truths, from twisted Marxist, lefty politics, manipulate you.\n\nHowever at anytime, Australian Aborigines can hand in their iPhones, and free accommodation, all the acting roles offered to them on Tv, and movies, give up the priority entitlement they hold In many cases for employment, and all the rest of the free welfare, and go into the bush, and live like they used too.\n\nBe happy, ...go hunt, create fun rock paintings, rub two sticks together, blow the didgeridoo, and good riddance.\n\nThat's probably the best solution for everyone.\n\nOh and the whole 'Stolen generation' is not what you have been lead to believe.\n\nDO YOUR RESEARCH, DON'T BELIEVE POLITICIANS !",

It's a day of mourning for the aboriginals and Torres Strait islanders whose ancestors have lost their lives, and they had things torn from them. It's was a terrifying day in Aussie history for them, and as they came, they had mixed feelings of confusion. It's not fair and it's not an appropriate event to be celebrated, a lot of people don't realise that to the indigenous, it's invasion day, the day everything fell apart. It's a gut dropping event for them, and I fully understand if they don't want to talk about. You can call me an idiot and not an aussie. But doing what I believe is right for the indigenous.",

We all know we aren't truly independent from Britian but in Canada, Canada day signifies the day we were no longer ruled by Britain and could make our own decisions. I was taught in school that Australia day was also to celebrate this independence from British rule. So these people are saying Australia day is about genocide on that exact day, and not freedom from the people who were doing the genocide aka the British?",

But I think it's not an ideal day for the 26th. It was an invasion and we need to remember it as a day that hurt the Traditional owners of this land. Celebrate Australianday any other day. Aussies won't turn down a day to celebrate. Remember that it's a day that reminds us of the many ppl who died and lost their own traditional land and were powerlessly defeated. soo yes change the date for the respect of the traditional ppl who have already lost so much",

                    "commentText": "@Kashina Crabbe I dont think you understand the way gods kingdom works.. God  built his kingdom and for many many years he tried he created many forms of animals to make it all work for instance he created fish to clean the seas, he created cows and chickens, he created four legged beats of the fields to work in the fields, but after some time he realized gods kingdom just would not work without gods actual spirit within the kingdom itself. So created Adam and eve and breathed life into them and breathed gods own spirit into onto them. He created his own special people known as the Awdawn. Aka Adam. He gave all of this world to his blessed Awdawn people (white people) and in return asked us to live in his image. So he sent us all around gods kingdom to every part of it to civilize and grow fruitful and manage gods kingdom in his own image. This is what we have done we have invented and constructed beyond belief. Infrastructure, space travel, electricity.. etc. This is because God gave us a soul and a spiritual energy that never ends. You on the other hand were created a long time before us back when all of the animals were made. You were made without soul and without the mind power to do the things we have. God gave you the brains to do your job. Work some fields and basically your here to do a job and part of the animal catergory. Some of you are hybrids dating back to when Cain bred to a female beast of the field after drinking alot of alcahol,  slightly more open minded only still without a soul or any kind of spirituality or connection to God apart from what from you were created for.. you don't realize it but the happiest place for you is to be where God originally placed you! Working for Adam and Eve's descendants in our fields. So you need to understand that we did not steal anything from you! God gave us this kingdom! And you will never know the true happiness that God intended for you also until you return to what God made you for. And I'm sorry but you cant blame us gods chosen special people to be like him for what God has made and how God has made it. The problem lies within you! Your trying to be something your not! God made you with 4 legs! Yet you forced your descendants to stand up onto your 2 back legs so as to copy us, God placed you in the field yet you continuously run off from it and try to live among us, you will never be happy trying to be something your not.",

Oh, modern Australians will do!Give me the real\u00a0 (post ice <b> age)</b> original Australians any day. They were trusting, respectful, well humoured, proud and intelligent people. They would NOT have been easily manipulated by some university driven<b>  racist</b> claims like some of the modern 'aboriginals' are.And when it comes to Aboriginals being the first Australians, the proof is still certainly missing.

But who were the pre i<b> ce a</b>ge inhabitants who so richly endowed the caves prior to the current Wandjina art of the recent (last 5k years) era aboriginals. The answer is still awaiting discovery, so lets realise we are all, in one way or another, descended from invaders and get on with creating a unified future without all these bitter individuals!",

As has happened in every country on earth that was discovered, colonized, and built up into something great!.\nThat's why we celebrate Australia Day  -  it deserves to be celebrated on that exact day when Arthur Philip gave thanks for completing the greatest feat of seamanship and navigation ever undertaken to bring all those people in all those boats all that way  safely to these shores.  And like it or not, folks, that's what happened.   Isn't it time to accept it?\nI'm more Irish than many aboriginals are aboriginals, and I have aboriginal ancestry, so don't accuse me of being <b> racist.</b>  I look to the future, give thanks for this wonderful country, and I just GET ON WITH IT, for God's sake.

Cook was a truly great explorer, who mapped out new parts of the Earth. He took many years of his life to do this and it assisted all civilised people.\nThe people here are not aboriginals at all. But they are the people who call themselves aboriginal, they do this to benefit from the $34 billion allocation of government money to native Australians.\nHow do they thank the government? They complain of Cooks arrival as if it was some sort of invasion of 'their' land.\nYet all of the complainers have far more genes from the colonists and subsequent immigrants than they have from aborigines. In truth, it was Cook, that led to the existence of these people.",

There are not many people who use Australia Day to celebrate the destruction that white settlement caused. I'm no part Aboriginal but I don't mind if they change the date if it makes them feel better, but they should also remember that the people that invaded Australia were British. The people alive in Australia today are Australians. We're different people to those that invaded so there shouldn't be too much ill-feeling towards people who celebrate Australia Day for diff reasons. Most of it is a celebration of the great weather, cracking open cold ones with the boys, and BBQ's.",

Back than sure I admit there was quite a few atrocities committed and if any of us could of take back all the bad atrocities that did happen we would under standing today what our ancestor did was wrong in the way they went about it. But if we are ever going to achieve something as a <b> nation </b>we cant sob about what happened back then if we do we are going to get no where so lets get over it. Besides if it didn't happen try and think where Australia would be now I'll give you the answer the same place where it is now though the high chance is that you wouldn't be speaking English it would eventually colonised completely as French and trust me your lucky it wasn't french they didn't have the best reputation in the late 1700 time period. Now as for the Dutch ewww damn you would be lucky not to be shot in mass numbers slaughterd like animals with no remorse no mercy but then thats the way of the people as it were. As for British mandate at the time if you representatives of His Majesty king George III it was that if you had ran into the natives it was priority to make contact with them and try to reason with them though trade now if any one was to harm any subjects of the kings they were to be dealt with through talks or force if you present your self as hostile any way it ridicules this video",

Sorry for turning it for what it is now \u2013 rich, multicultural, modern, full of talented artists, one of the top destinations for migrants all over the world because of its tolerance to other beliefs and most importantly, has the most generous government to its native landowners. If anyone disagrees, then name 5 countries in the world who would give more benefits and assistance to anyone with a drop of aboriginal blood than Australia?",

I understand why people feel offended, but people need to realise that there are other sigificant reasons why australia day is on the 26th of jan. to me, australia day represents diversity and it represents the beautiful country we have today. this video suggests that white people like me, sit around on australia day celebrating the fact that we invaded aboriginal land, this is not the case. I spend my australia day getting together with my family, celebrating the wonderful, accepting, and diverse country that we are lucky to live in. so although I 100% understand where aboriginal people are coming from, they need to understand where we are coming from aswell.",

The laws made for indigenous Australian's were insane beyond belief, one law brought in 1959 is completely insane I'm not going to reveal, look up some history stop watching the prime time news get some reel facts before making yourselves look stupid!!!!",

                    "commentText": "@BitzemUp Yubalah  I dont think you understand the way gods kingdom works.. God  built his kingdom and for many many years he tried he created many forms of animals to make it all work for instance he created fish to clean the seas, he created cows and chickens, he created four legged beats of the fields to work in the fields, but after some time he realized gods kingdom just would not work without gods actual spirit within the kingdom itself. So created Adam and eve and breathed life into them and breathed gods own spirit into onto them. He created his own special people known as the Awdawn. Aka Adam. He gave all of this world to his blessed Awdawn people (white people) and in return asked us to live in his image. So he sent us all around gods kingdom to every part of it to civilize and grow fruitful and manage gods kingdom in his own image. This is what we have done we have invented and constructed beyond belief. Infrastructure, space travel, electricity.. etc. This is because God gave us a soul and a spiritual energy that never ends. You on the other hand were created a long time before us back when all of the animals were made. You were made without soul and without the mind power to do the things we have. God gave you the brains to do your job. Work some fields and basically your here to do a job and part of the animal catergory. Some of you are hybrids dating back to when Cain bred to a female beast of the field after drinking alot of alcahol,  slightly more open minded only still without a soul or any kind of spirituality or connection to God apart from what from you were created for.. you don't realize it but the happiest place for you is to be where God originally placed you! Working for Adam and Eve's descendants in our fields. So you need to understand that we did not steal anything from you! God gave us this kingdom! And you will never know the true happiness that God intended for you also until you return to what God made you for. And I'm sorry but you cant blame us gods chosen special people to be like him for what God has made and how God has made it. The problem lies within you! Your trying to be something your not! God made you with 4 legs! Yet you forced your descendants to stand up onto your 2 back legs so as to copy us, God placed you in the field yet you continuously run off from it and try to live among us, you will never be happy trying to be something your not.",

Secondly \"Get over it, it's in the past\"?! Okay... aboriginals will just forget about there ancestors that died, and where saluted and raped, what about Anzac Day? Remembrance Day? That's in the past and people where slaughter and killed but lest we forget haha it's funny isn't it? Just think of it this way, your house mates come home and say their gunna have a party on Saturday , but you ask them can they change the date because that when your father died, good people would say sure well do it next Saturday, it's kinda the same, except your housemates welcomed their selves into your house, doesn't pay rent, and their dad killed your dad. (Not my own words) anyways I'm only young and the only thing I like about Australia Day is fireworks and stalls at festivals. Oh and \"all of these people are either mixed, or white, mmm aboriginal you say, okay, alright, sure\" shut up, its not about the colour on the outside it's all about what's inside, so before you start assumin<b> g rac</b>e how about you go look at the facts, and think before you speak :))",

                    "commentText": "@Kashina Crabbe I dont think you understand the way gods kingdom works.. God  built his kingdom and for many many years he tried he created many forms of animals to make it all work for instance he created fish to clean the seas, he created cows and chickens, he created four legged beats of the fields to work in the fields, but after some time he realized gods kingdom just would not work without gods actual spirit within the kingdom itself. So created Adam and eve and breathed life into them and breathed gods own spirit into onto them. He created his own special people known as the Awdawn. Aka Adam. He gave all of this world to his blessed Awdawn people (white people) and in return asked us to live in his image. So he sent us all around gods kingdom to every part of it to civilize and grow fruitful and manage gods kingdom in his own image. This is what we have done we have invented and constructed beyond belief. Infrastructure, space travel, electricity.. etc. This is because God gave us a soul and a spiritual energy that never ends. You on the other hand were created a long time before us back when all of the animals were made. You were made without soul and without the mind power to do the things we have. God gave you the brains to do your job. Work some fields and basically your here to do a job and part of the animal catergory. Some of you are hybrids dating back to when Cain bred to a female beast of the field after drinking alot of alcahol,  slightly more open minded only still without a soul or any kind of spirituality or connection to God apart from what from you were created for.. you don't realize it but the happiest place for you is to be where God originally placed you! Working for Adam and Eve's descendants in our fields. So you need to understand that we did not steal anything from you! God gave us this kingdom! And you will never know the true happiness that God intended for you also until you return to what God made you for. And I'm sorry but you cant blame us gods chosen special people to be like him for what God has made and how God has made it. The problem lies within you! Your trying to be something your not! God made you with 4 legs! Yet you forced your descendants to stand up onto your 2 back legs so as to copy us, God placed you in the field yet you continuously run off from it and try to live among us, you will never be happy trying to be something your not.",

I often try to put myself in their shoes and know that I would feel so bad at times walking around in a country that used to be mine but now has been taken over. But on the other hand my ancestors did not invade but were brought here as convicts against their will. The invasion came later. And yes heaps of bad stuff came upon the Aboriginals because of us - this is true. But if we as Whiteys cannot celebrate the Australia we love then what? Another way to look at things is that if it wasn't the English it would have been the Chinese, Japanese, Indonesians etc that would have taken Australia. There were simply not enough Aboriginals to defend it. Do you think these other races would have been fairer? Have you seen how Indonesians treat Papuans who protest against Indonesian occupation? So what is the answer - an independent Aboriginal state?",

If you are unwilling to accept that our history has evil to it then you are complicit in that evil history. i.e. if you are saying \"it's not our fault that we celebrate the worst day in your 50 000 years of history\" then you are saying \"i dont think there was anything wrong with what happened to your people\" and you are leaving plenty of room to perpetuat<b> e racis</b>m & for there to be continued violence against these people.

The reason Australia Day is celebrated is becuase it's the national day of Australia. It's not about who did what back then and no one actually celebrates that. The reason Jan 26th was picked was becuase the \"Day\" was invented by Europeans and they just chose the date they came to Australia. Australia Day is more about celebrating the fact that your Australian. It's about getting up with your friends and eating from BBQ drinking beer and watching the cricket.",

God  built his kingdom and for many many years he tried he created many forms of animals to make it all work for instance he created fish to clean the seas, he created cows and chickens, he created four legged beats of the fields to work in the fields, but after some time he realized gods kingdom just would not work without gods actual spirit within the kingdom itself. So created Adam and eve and breathed life into them and breathed gods own spirit into onto them. He created his own special people known as the Awdawn. Aka Adam. He gave all of this world to his blessed Awdawn people (white people) and in return asked us to live in his image. So he sent us all around gods kingdom to every part of it to civilize and grow fruitful and manage gods kingdom in his own image. This is what we have done we have invented and constructed beyond belief. Infrastructure, space travel, electricity.. etc. This is because God gave us a soul and a spiritual energy that never ends. You on the other hand were created a long time before us back when all of the animals were made. You were made without soul and without the mind power to do the things we have. God gave you the brains to do your job. Work some fields and basically your here to do a job and part of the animal catergory. Some of you are hybrids dating back to when Cain bred to a female beast of the field after drinking alot of alcahol,  slightly more open minded only still without a soul or any kind of spirituality or connection to God apart from what from you were created for.. you don't realize it but the happiest place for you is to be where God originally placed you! Working for Adam and Eve's descendants in our fields. So you need to understand that we did not steal anything from you! God gave us this kingdom! And you will never know the true happiness that God intended for you also until you return to what God made you for. And I'm sorry but you cant blame us gods chosen special people to be like him for what God has made and how God has made it. The problem lies within you! Your trying to be something your not! God made you with 4 legs! Yet you forced your descendants to stand up onto your 2 back legs so as to copy us, God placed you in the field yet you continuously run off from it and try to live among us, you will never be happy trying to be something your not.",

Bring a 1min silence like they do for the Anzacs and Remembrance Day which had white and <b> black </b>Australians fighting together. Over 90% of indigenous people got wiped out through murder and slavery. I understand a lot of people come together with friends and family for BBQ to mainly celebrate life. But a simple thing like a 1min silence would make a massive difference as whole.<b>  Racism</b> will never die and clearly it shows in these comments. We might have different skin colour but all of us have the same insides. Change the day don't change the day I don't care but at least look up or read up Australia's past that's been looked over for so many years and really look at indigenous Australians history and cultures you'll be surprised and most likely learn a lot about Australia as a whole. So on the 26th give a 1min silence as a tribute to indigenous aussies before you start you Australia Day. Thank you everyone for reading this all. Sorry for the essay #1minsilence",

Males tend to have less felt empathy than women. \n\n Then, you have the subset of truly nasty people, very low empathy and highly self centered, who are filled with discontent, hatred, and dislike to all things different from themselves (really, deep down they have a severe lack of self love/acceptance), who are too scared to speak openly and publicly about their real beliefs and perceptions in their non I-net lives, and so under the anonymity of the I-net and fake names, their pent up shadow gets spewed out almost uncontrollably. They temporarily become loud and proud, and seeing others like them, only fuels their persistence and loudness. \n\nThis makes them seem bigger and more numerous than they really are.  There are both less of them, and yet more of them, than most really think, if that makes any sense.  \n\n   Personally, I don\u00b4t understand why the date can\u00b4t be changed.  It currently does represent a very hurtful date to a lot of Australians, and especially those connected to the more original inhabitants.  \n    At the same time, its not healthy to dwell on the past too much either.  However, neither is it helpful to forget the past entirely, otherwise if you\u00b4re not cognizant of it, the chances of repeating the mistakes of the past increase. Like so many things in life, balance is key.\n\n    And reason/logic needs to be balanced with empathy, and feeling/empathy needs to be balanced with reason/logic.",

God  built his kingdom and for many many years he tried he created many forms of animals to make it all work for instance he created fish to clean the seas, he created cows and chickens, he created four legged beats of the fields to work in the fields, but after some time he realized gods kingdom just would not work without gods actual spirit within the kingdom itself. So created Adam and eve and breathed life into them and breathed gods own spirit into onto them. He created his own special people known as the Awdawn. Aka Adam. He gave all of this world to his blessed Awdawn people (white people) and in return asked us to live in his image. So he sent us all around gods kingdom to every part of it to civilize and grow fruitful and manage gods kingdom in his own image. This is what we have done we have invented and constructed beyond belief. Infrastructure, space travel, electricity.. etc. This is because God gave us a soul and a spiritual energy that never ends. You on the other hand were created a long time before us back when all of the animals were made. You were made without soul and without the mind power to do the things we have. God gave you the brains to do your job. Work some fields and basically your here to do a job and part of the animal catergory. Some of you are hybrids dating back to when Cain bred to a female beast of the field after drinking alot of alcahol,  slightly more open minded only still without a soul or any kind of spirituality or connection to God apart from what from you were created for.. you don't realize it but the happiest place for you is to be where God originally placed you! Working for Adam and Eve's descendants in our fields. So you need to understand that we did not steal anything from you! God gave us this kingdom! And you will never know the true happiness that God intended for you also until you return to what God made you for. And I'm sorry but you cant blame us gods chosen special people to be like him for what God has made and how God has made it. The problem lies within you! Your trying to be something your not! God made you with 4 legs! Yet you forced your descendants to stand up onto your 2 back legs so as to copy us, God placed you in the field yet you continuously run off from it and try to live among us, you will never be happy trying to be something your not.",

If someone like me wants to learn they will gladly teach you, if you mess up and say something offensive they will pull you up so you can learn as they can tell if you have good intentions but just don't understand. If you have ever come in contact with someone aboriginal who hasn't mean willing to talk maybe it's due to trauma, there are still people alive today who were apart of the stolen generation. If they are distant it's understandable, that's called PTSD. You know the thing us young people like to say we have after mummy yells once.",

Cook was a truly great explorer, who mapped out new parts of the Earth. He took many years of his life to do this and it assisted all civilised people.\nThe people here are not aboriginals at all. But they are the people who call themselves aboriginal, they do this to benefit from the $34 billion allocation of government money to native Australians.\nHow do they thank the government? They complain of Cooks arrival as if it was some sort of invasion of 'their' land. Yet all of the complainers have far more genes from the colonists and subsequent immigrants than they have from aborigines. In truth, it was Cook, that led to the existence of these people.",

                    "commentText": "@Tegan Smith  I dont think you understand the way gods kingdom works.. God  built his kingdom and for many many years he tried he created many forms of animals to make it all work for instance he created fish to clean the seas, he created cows and chickens, he created four legged beats of the fields to work in the fields, but after some time he realized gods kingdom just would not work without gods actual spirit within the kingdom itself. So created Adam and eve and breathed life into them and breathed gods own spirit into onto them. He created his own special people known as the Awdawn. Aka Adam. He gave all of this world to his blessed Awdawn people (white people) and in return asked us to live in his image. So he sent us all around gods kingdom to every part of it to civilize and grow fruitful and manage gods kingdom in his own image. This is what we have done we have invented and constructed beyond belief. Infrastructure, space travel, electricity.. etc. This is because God gave us a soul and a spiritual energy that never ends. You on the other hand were created a long time before us back when all of the animals were made. You were made without soul and without the mind power to do the things we have. God gave you the brains to do your job. Work some fields and basically your here to do a job and part of the animal catergory. Some of you are hybrids dating back to when Cain bred to a female beast of the field after drinking alot of alcahol,  slightly more open minded only still without a soul or any kind of spirituality or connection to God apart from what from you were created for.. you don't realize it but the happiest place for you is to be where God originally placed you! Working for Adam and Eve's descendants in our fields. So you need to understand that we did not steal anything from you! God gave us this kingdom! And you will never know the true happiness that God intended for you also until you return to what God made you for. And I'm sorry but you cant blame us gods chosen special people to be like him for what God has made and how God has made it. The problem lies within you! Your trying to be something your not! God made you with 4 legs! Yet you forced your descendants to stand up onto your 2 back legs so as to copy us, God placed you in the field yet you continuously run off from it and try to live among us, you will never be happy trying to be something your not.",

                    "commentText": "They all have Anglo Celtic names - because their great great  grandma took  an ex convict or settler as a husband. \n\nMost like to say they were raped but the truth is their ancestors were called Fringe Dwellers living off and exchanging goods with whites. They naturally saw benefit with the whites and as women do saw benefit in men who could offer more resources taking them as partners, while the single men took the women for the obvious reason there was a massive lack of single women. ( Logically why would their ancestors take an Anglo name if they were raped .. clearly they weren't )\n\nNow the government and media push the guilt narrative they once again know where to turn to milk more resources, which is the guilt complex while ignoring reality of their own white lineage. \n\nIn 1901 there was an estimated 10 000 full blooded aboriginals. Today there'd be maybe 40000 with the other 650 000 having less than half. \n\nAt a guess Id say 5% are full blood. \n15% are half\n80% are quarter or less. \n\nOf course if you mention they're  mixed they take the high moral ground. None are very honest about how much they interacted and benefited from whites. It's a la mode to be a victim in the 21sr century so they go on the well paved path to self benefit. \n\nThis dialectic of division came about since Rudd apologized in 2008 and has seen the population swell at double the rate of the general population as every person with some melanin clamours over one another to claim their heritage which gives them a plethora of opportunity from academic to employment to social recognition with speaking engagements. \n\nReally the government uses them as a foil to placate debate over mass immigration which has been used to keep the economy afloat. \n\nNewly arrived immigrants can say and do say it's not your land you stole it .. ergo it's everyone's land. \n\nOf course no one asks the full blood Aboriginals if they want more migrants. And then the half castes don't care cause they get sympathy and don't have to worry about who pays the $33 billion a year for their welfare.",

You can be as dark as night but not respect your tribe, which in a lot of people's minds makes you only an aboriginal person by genetics. Before voicing your opinions on a topic please do research or speak to an aboriginal <b> elder.</b>",

We need to learn from the past, we need to acknowledge the wrong doings and how growing through struggles we unite as one people in this country we are proud to call home. Sorry! As an Englishman, I am a product of European and Scandinavian invasions of the Island I am indigenous to. The attempts at Genocide to my people from various other land masses resulted in a colourful and complex history of dominant struggle. This eventuated in the Great British Empire which perpetuated the invasion dominance struggle itself to other shores. The global atrocities that occurred in this evolving empire as well as from other modernising societies and their subjugation of other lands and nations continued as it had from pre-history. Australia in its modern manifestation can choose to unite and celebrate what Australia is today or we can dwell on the clearly lamentable times of past crimes and injustices? It's our choice. If the day offends then change it to celebrate a day of our choosing when we unite. The term Australia day is surely fine as that is. Hottest 100 day it is., now where is my Viking, anglo-Saxon, norman Gaulish costume of the empire!!!",

So there is a very minimum amount of full Aboriginals, since if would have to be a generations and generations of over 60,000 years of full blown Abos having kids. As for them being half-casts, they are still Aboriginal! Just because you don't have full <b> Abo </b>blood, it's still in there and they are still Aboriginal people",

If an aboriginal had wanted to kill someone, they would have done so, with a spear, and much more efficiently than any 1788 firearm.

The suggestion that it should happen illustrates a lack of substance within the aboriginal community: an inability to create, sustain or share their own cultural values. \nInstead, aboriginals are negatively attacking white man's half-hearted celebration of the arrival of white people in Australia.  Most whites want the day to be attached to a weekend, which shows they value the holiday aspect above the concept of any kind a conquest or victory.\nBe honest, or be quiet.",

It is terrible what happened to the full blooded aboriginal people but you want to know something every single country in the world was invaded by conquerors, colonised and prospered. Don't hear the English demanding repatriations from Italy and the Romans raped, pillaged and murdered their way across Europe.",

I'm East European, ancestors came in the 70,s,  I think what the country should of done was recognise the aboriginal culture, one of the oldest people that have lived, your people were peaceful earth people destroyed by the English, me personally I don't celebrate this day, if people truly want to celebrate a day about \"Australia\" the aboriginal culture must be recognised and the people need to understand the genocide towards them by the English! Something small maybe a ceremony on Australia Day commemorating the oldest civilisation, that died under the hands of the white man, remembering the women, men and children that had fallen! Instead though the descendants of the English convicts rather get pissed and tell new comers to go home, lol",

I have two female aboriginal friends. They work. They bought a house. They get on with it. One of them was taken from her mother. She used to have to have a pass to go to the shops when she was a child.  That doesn't happen now and although it hurt her tremendously, she keeps moving forward with the times.  It's time to move forward. <b>  Nothing</b> good can come from continuously looking in the rear view mirror.  These white blooded Aboriginals are no more Aboriginal than I am English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish & German like my ancestors.  You just wait until Sharia Law takes control of Australia.

My brother is born on Australia day and we have the royal spoon from the queen herself. You see, Australia day means a lot to most people. Im not saying that Aboriginals weren't treated badly because they were and at the time, thats when slavery was around (including in America) but the past is the past. 26th of January is not Invasion day! it is Australia day and we all must work together! Stop trying to separate yourself and call it invasion day when there's cries and whining of when Aboriginals are separated from Australian culture. Aboriginals are aussies too. Wanna call it different then leave.",

Go ahead and take a poll. I doubt most aboriginals would prefer that. What do you think?",

Children are required to go to school, while those of working <b> age </b>are expected to work a few hours a week within their communities to earn their government allowances.  That's the extent of the \"Eurocentricity\".  Bear in mind that our population consists of 200 nationalities and not all hail from Europe!",

When someone was so poor that he couldn't afford a horse, a tent or a blanket, he would, in that case, receive it all as a gift. We were too uncivilized to give great importance to private property. We didn't know any kind of money and consequently, the value of a human being was not determined by his wealth. We had no written laws laid down, no lawyers, no politicians, therefore we were not able to cheat and swindle one another. We were really in bad shape before the white man arrived and I don't know how to explain how we were able to manage without these fundamental things that (so they tell us) are so necessary for a civilized society.'",

The Australian <b> Abo,</b> the lowest IQ of any<b>  race</b> on the planet, 65 moron level. Left to their own devices they are incapable of organising or articulating anything,\u00a0so it's left to the bleeding hearts, liberals and Whit<b> e\u00a0Ab</b>o's\u00a0to push the lies on a gullible Australian public. Ever seen a full blood Aboriginal Dr? They are probably out there though,\u00a0because our university's a<b> re nothi</b>ng more than Marxist indoctrination centres that have debased the currency of education to such an extent. Billions of dollars given to them ever since the ruino<b> us, nat</b>ion wrec<b> king co</b>mmie idiot Gough Whitlam, only to be stolen by these half breeds (or less) officials,\u00a0masquerading as genuinely indigenous, or pissed up against the wall.<b> \u00a0 And no</b>thing to show for it but more crime, grime, filth,\u00a0dysfunction and settlements that look like rubbish tips.

Given everything, but when their car runs out of petrol it's abandoned. Floor boards ripped up and used as firewood. Stolen generation, more lies. Those kids were taken from incredibly abusive situations for their own protection. It's still happening now. Some of the things those kids are constantly being subjected too would make your flesh crawl, but the bleeding hearts and money grubbing shyster lawyers maintain the lies and status quo. The emperor has no clothes in regard to the Australian Aboriginal. WAKE UP AUSTRALIA! They\u00a0respond to one thing and one thing only - paternalism.

Aboriginal communities values are not western values. Aboriginal violence is a major concern in NT. Most of Aboriginals in video are not full blood and have conformed to western society. What do they want more land? If Aboriginals want to be part of western society they would conform but they dont. The whole victim economy is big business. It's a sham. If you don't teach it then it won't exist. Instead of victimhood AUS needs to teach mathematics, engineering, kids need more play hours, have a national sport like soccer progress to Brazil levels, create a national dance, create a national festival. Why focus on the past that was obviously unfair to people. Teach kids to be happy not victims.",

It's economics, intelligent way to make money. Asians are not forced into labor. They choose to work for low wages. \n- Don't care about fashion\n- My culture is whenever you leave your home that a white man designed hundreds of years ago and walk into a shop and pay for food or other products that a white man built the train,forged the steel, built the engine of the vehicle which transports it to the market. \n- Most<b>  Racism</b> today is manufactured. Races of people will always choose thei<b> r ethni</b>c group.\n- White slavery as well <b> as Bla</b>ck slavery happened along time ago in the US and the world. Slavery was a choice.\n- I do h<b> ave bl</b>ack and hispanic cousins. \n- I see reality everyday. \n- If you don't want to live in the white man's world then immigrate. \n- Obviously your mother or your father didn't respect your Indegenous traditions because you are <b> half afr</b>ican. If understand correctly that you are<b>  part Af</b>rican and Indegenous. You're sentence structure is poor and you're missing words. \n\nThe key point is you \"hate\" white people but you actually want to be white to see if your life would be better. Your perception is only in your mind.\n\n- Europe and most of US was built physically by Europeans. \n\n Non whites were conquered by whites and adopted the white man's culture of wearing clothes, valuing currency, education, food security, and housing. Non whites did not have to follow European culture. Non whites did because THEY wanted a better standard of living.\n\n Tips: be a respectable person and don't pu<b> ll th</b>e race card and you will be fine.",

Our aboriginal people don't want to cancel Australia Day. They just want to celebrate it on another date. Thats it. There's no doubt that aboriginal people have gradually been treated better over the past few decades.\n\nYes, its true that \"most\" of the mistreatment of our aboriginal people occurred before our time. But lets not forget that aboriginal children were still \"stolen from their families right up to and through the 1960's, also weren't given the right to vote until the 1960`s as well. Up until this time, they were still only considered natives which for that day and <b> age </b>is quite concerning.\u00a0\n\nOn a final point, if you're going to mention \"anti-white sentiments without mentioning anti aboriginal sentiments, then you're clearly only highlighting one side of the argument.\n\nOnce again, this debate is about changing the date of Australia Day because its the date that an invasion started and still involved the mistreatment of aboriginal people up until recent times as stated above. \n\nHave a great day.",

Half a million across the Harbour Bridge. \n\nThat's the biggest march in our history. \n\nThere has always been support. \n\nIt's just the government playing mind games and creating division now to enable mass immigration which is a short term economic solution with negative long term consequences. \n\nMany people who make these points are called <b> racist </b>( about immigration ). \n\nThe Aboriginal issue is a side distraction. A rich mans trick. \n\nThe general population are sick of being told they're racists when for 50 years we've been actively trying to help. \n\nMost young people who cry<b>  racism</b> are too young to know the actual history of this country, and unfortunately too lazy to look beyond the veil as it takes time to read books.

The people I know send their children's to boarding schools in Melbourne and Sydney, so they can have a brighter future and proper education to make us proud..some of Australians always see the bad side of aboriginal people and never the good.

I see it even in my culture, Mexican Americans being loud mouths about how the US stole Mexico's land, and now it's ours, we should take it back. Yet that's only Mexican Americans, my parents and everyone that comes here don't care about all that, they just wanna work and have a better life. It's when they're born privileged that they now feel like they suffered and someone needs to pay. Sadly I see that in this video here as well.",

So even if they didn't believe in owning land it was still their territory and they had that plus their culture and lives taken away, and to this day they're trying to learn about their culture that they have been forced to let go of.

This is incorrect just because you have more then one culture in you does not mean you are any less of that culture. Think of it like having two kids you don't only love each of those kids half just because you have two,you love them both fully. Also just because they have fair or fairer skin does not necessary mean they are mixed <b> race,</b>many Tasmanian Aboriginals have fair skin. Another reason is in the past and today many people of mixed<b>  race</b> are made fun of,being told they don't belong anywhere.Not real aboriginals not real white people (examples).\n\nxx",

During extensive interviews with aboriginal women, their response, when asked if they would turn back time if they could, was that European men taught aboriginals equality between sexes, and their lives improved since 'invasion day'.\n\nSeveral years ago I became aware that aborigines were given homes and cars by the government - things Europeans worked all their lives for.  The result was an Outback littered with the rusty carcasses of their abandoned vehicles, because they couldn't be bothered servicing or fixing them.  They'd simply apply to the government for new ones.  Their homes became bonfires through floorboards being set alight during corroborrees.  Our country is an entire continent, a 4-hour plane ride from east to west; aborigines bemoan that their country was taken over yet most of us have never met face to face due to the distance between us.  If aborigines want to live by their <b> old </b>nomadic traditions, why do they simultaneously  accept homes, cars and welfare money?  I don't mean to denigrate dark skinned races but one thing they have in<b>  common</b> is their willingness to be paid for doin<b> g nothin</b>g, then bemoan the government's existence and make it and all white inhabitants out to <b> be raci</b>st.

I get that it celebrates not so great historical stuff but to me this like if I tried saying Christmas is wrong because it's (mostly) a Christian holiday and I'm an atheist who got plenty of hate from Christians. Yes murder is awful but seriously, they don't intend to offend you! They just want to celebrate the country they call home! If you have a problem with someone being happy in their country than you should probably go meditate on a mountain until a bolt of lightening hits you and you think 'god' sent you to 'spread his word' and god is the flying spaghetti monster.",

I'm italian and my family had <b> nothing </b>to do with the invasion on the indigenous community but yet celebrating the freedom and discovery of my country is<b>  racist</b> or offensive? it just doesn't make sense. our generation is accepting the indigenous culture, community and respect them as equals but they are still playing the victims. i just want our county all to be treated as equals rather than a debate on things that happened when this country came together. why can't we work on creating current change rather than dragging on something that happened before we were even born.",

Given the current politics of Federal Australia and Indigenous Australia, it is painful for me to confirm that the groups are still at war with each other, and the Feds have the upper hand as they were in the Colonial era, and they call such celebration \"pride\" at the expense of others. \ud83d\ude14\n\nOf course, now handful by handful, we are waking up. The best way to win the issue of celebrating Australia Day is not to play it... maybe a vigil service to mourn the people displaced and killed for Empire should be sufficient.\n\nNow to figuring out a peace treaty between the two groups... I pray the two sides will find peace and fully accept the Indigenous as they are... humanity fighting in the face of \"colonial arrogance\" way back when, and the \"arrogance\" we now wish to renounce now.\n\nPS: Really wished New Years Day was the True Australia Day.\n\nPPS: I have no more to say for now, but the issue is already vocal enough as it is already.",

Destruction of a culture and the oppression of a people.  I understand the intentions of those commenting, in not celebrating genocide, but it also speaks to how unwilling people are to understand why Australia's indigenous people hate that day. I mean how the mistreatment of the aboriginals really stopped, and if not what are you doing to make real change so Australia Day really means something? It's one thing to say \"ohhh I won't be blamed or be subdued by white guilt because of what my ancestors did\" but continue to benefit and be okay from the aboriginals demise. How then are you any different from your ancestors at that point?",

When did I say two wrongs make a right, or that what white people have done is worse??? We are focusing on WHITE Australians who, more than likely, would have ancestry that came from England and have nearly decimated an entire indigenous people... where is the confusion? Look, I understand it isn't fair for white people to be lashed at for the wickedness of their previous generation, I just have a problem when white people are oh so comfortable with the blinders of white privilege that are afforded to them based on the society created to conform to them. Indigenous people hate Australia Day because the underlying truth of the matter of how present day Australia even began is evil, and for people to continue to say\" oh well I don't think of it this way, so I will continue doing whatever pleases me at the perpetual, and unending, expense of the the aboriginal people is just not okay smh.",

Yes for years before they weren't a major part of it BUT for at least the past 6 years Aboriginals HAVE been included! They are shown respect through put Australia day but on many other occasions, not only is the Australian flag presented but so is the Aboriginal flag. \n\nDon't miss read what i am saying, i am by NO means saying that this is right and i am trying to make excuses for it. But what i am trying to say is that we as Australians are trying to make them included, for us to become one again.\n\n I also want to say that this is from MY OWN experiences and from what I HAVE SEEN but it may be different for other people.",

Australians don't even celebrate it and when they do they don't think of what has been done but who they are today because they are proud to be one. I guess through time Australia changed the definition of the day, instead of 'finding' or 'invading' the country (however you define it) has been lost. Aboriginals had it hard back then but now in benefit, a lot of Australians think it has been too long for their benefits. If they wanted to be treated as equals they get the same benefits, even teenagers are angry because it is harder to get into education when it is simply easier to get into a course in University. Aboriginals are doing great and yes it does not excuse what happened to their ancestors but today they are like everyone else. Instead of viewing Australia Day as the day when family was lost or hurt, view it now as the day you are proud to be born in the country because everyone in the country is part of it.",

            "commentText": "These people are all clearly mixed <b> race.</b> A few of them seem to be mostly caucasian Does that mean they are partly to blame for what their ancestors did to their ancestors?\nWhat I mean is when they say things like \"They invaded\" and \"They took our culture\" \"We were slaughtered\" Don't they mean \"We invaded and we slaughtered ourselves and took our culture away\"\n\nBecause its really<b>  weird</b> for met as a white person who only just immigrated to Australia to be told that its insensitive for me to have a BBQ on Australia day because of an injustice this persons ancestor committed to their other ancestor. \nAs far as I see it your messed up family history is not my business. \n\nDont get me wrong, I'm not saying that the european settlers didn't commit a huge crime or that moder<b> n racis</b>m doesn't need to be addressed and stamped out. But clearly if you're mix<b> ed ra</b>ce then your ancestors were both the oppressed and the oppressor. You cant just ignore that.\n\nAlmost all of us can look back and find a point where someone once committed an injustice against one of our ancestors, Robbing them of the future they deserved, (but at least creating the conditions necessary for us to have been born.)\nI myself was abandoned as a baby, boo hoo. (ok so its possible my ancestors were australian) So you could argue that I was robbed of a certain future, and of a history or culture I'll never know. But that makes no difference to me now, There<b>  is noth</b>ing I can do about that so why wallow in it.\nThe best we can do is learn from the past moving forward and find ways to make the world better for future generations.\nCurrent injustices committed against aborigines (and anyone else) are the issues that really need to be addressed because they're the only ones we can do anything about.\n\nAnyway there is a simple solution to this, Australians you should just move Australia day a bit. \nAnd the 26th can be a day where you mourn what your ancestors did to each other.",

This would be the birth of a<b>  nation</b> and sadly a death of a culture and the survival of <b> a rac</b>e.  Years and years of oppression these people would face under the hands of the European settlers and their offspring. The europeans tried a strategy to bred out the pure bloods so they couldn't seek claims in the future by tying up the aboriginal women to a bed and raping them. The aboriginal people were shifted off into less fertile lands. These actions left a rippling effect on generations of aboriginal people that would lead them into a deep depression. Through their vulnerababitly they would undergo psychological and environmental problems making them more prone to bad decision making addiction and crime. You cannot undo the actions of the past but you are sure as he'll benifiting from it and no redressing or welfare is going to pay for that.",

Its meant to be a day of celebrating the <b> nation </b>of Australia in the present as one people, whether your indigenous or not. Most people aren't actually celebrating the first fleet. Calling it invasion day and acting all pissed off about it isn't going to heal any wounds or do contribute to reconciliation in any way, but only causes more division. While its important to recognize  the past  so that history doesn't repeat, its also important not to live in the past because that doesn't produce any positive results, but rather its better to move on to a brighter future.",

Good to see and hear it being given voice. \n\nFurther, I am very concerned that statements of \"reconciliation\" are often framed in words of assimilation. I saw one in in my local Centrelink a couple of years ago and was stunned by what it really said. You could almost hear the background chant \"One of us, one of us\".\n\nReconciliation seems to be \"Sorry we took your land and your home and killed any of your people who got in the way and kidnapped your children, but come live like us, it's the best thing ever!! You'll find us very accepting people if you're happy to adopt our culture. We need to become one, modern country. And look, we'll make movies and write books about all your <b> old </b>stuff, so it won't be forgotten. Come to the city and get a degree and a job and a mortgage and an iPhone... One of us, one of us.\"\n\nReconciliation seems to be this condescending and self righteous effort to lift \"them\" up to \"our level\".\n\nReconciliation must be about preserving and protecting as much remaining Indigenous culture as possible (not about recording a memory of it).",

The British colonies in Australia were far more lenient and caring for the locals (I refuse to say indigenous since the only place any human is indigenous to is a part of Africa) than the American colonies were to their locals.\n\nAnd it's not like they had to either. They could have quite easily just come through and wiped them all out, there weren't even that many to begin with (still aren't). But they didn't. What happened in Australia is actually a rather rare occurrence given the track record of Imperialism during the 18 and 19 hundreds.\n\nIf anything you should feel a sense of dignity; in no other country did the colonists try to actually give the locals a better life; albeit against their will, but keep the times in context here; things like universal suffrage and human rights were relatively premature concepts at the time.\n\nGetting angry at people who had never even had contact with the kind of morality and ethics you've been exposed to your entire life is kind of absurd.",

And those sheep that followed him and believed native people ha<b> d nothin</b>g to offer and were just flora and fauna.  What absolute rubbish was that mindset!!!!  That psychological warfare on Aboriginals was designed to cheat them out of landrights and to dissolve their natural laws and beliefs which they had developed over more than 60,000 years.\n\nMany people have been brainwashed by a failed schooling system that didn't teach Truth.  People are waking up to the horrendous lie that is called Australia Day - the worst thing is to wake up to all the lies your school and community told you as a child -  But the people that have been in control of Australia for so long are good at lying they aren't even the real Royals of Britain - Of course Murdoch who owns about 70% of Australia's media won't put that on the news.\n\nWhat is important is that you who are Aboriginals never ever ever give up seeking the truth - keep going keep living your lives how you imagined them to be - keep striving - keep having a voice - keep following your path - you have every right because of course it really is your country your homeland\n\nHow can anyone say Happy Australia Day on a day of mourning that's like saying Happy ANZAC DAY or Happy Remembrance Day (for World War I and II)\n\nSeriously why raise your kids to think it's okay to celebrate on Australia Day.  Killing & separating people & enslaving them for land and gold is not okay.  Killing isn't  wasn't what \"Jesus\" taught whose real name was actually Yahusha(yes they change that history too) who followed God YHVH also known as Yahweh.  That wasn't Christian that wasn't Holy that wasn't fair what the Holy Roman Catholic British Royals did to t<b> he Bla</b>ck Natives of Australia we call Aborigines.  They were NOT following Christ and therefore they were not Christian.\n\nIf you really want to do anything on Australia Day try Laying flowers at Aboriginal memorials instead.",

Over a few thousand years, their fire-farming turned the inland of Australia into an arid, inhospitable wasteland. They were constantly at war with different tribes. They engaged in cannibalism. In all the time that they were here, the aboriginals invented no written language. They didn't build homes or townships. They were the most unproductive and under-evolved strain on the human on the planet. Had they been accepting of the Europeans, they would have fared better. They now have a first world country that offers them everything, and yet they have the gall to hate those that developed this country. Settling countries is how the world was made. Warring of species is what animals do. We humans, as animals, are very fortunate that we have evolved into the semi-peaceful creature that we are today. Just enjoy the day. You're alive, right?",

The first fleet consisted of six convict transports, 3 supply ships and 2 navy escorts; with 582 male, 193 female and 14 child convicts, with 348 others (ships crew, marines and admin). 48 died and 28 were born en-route. The colony came close to starving in its early years. Many of the local aboriginal people died around the same time of smallpox. \nThe history is complex and dark, but not without flashes of hope. It is a different history from, say, South Africa or the USA, and to equate them with each other is to disdain the unique suffering of them all. 26 January 1788 was not a happy day for anyone, but something survived and grew, and it is in that shared survival and growth that there is perhaps some scope for all of us to reflect soberly on our shared past, present state and future improvement.",

The only Australian history we were taught is a brief mention the Aboriginal people and then skip straight to the gold rush in Ballarat. \n\nThoughts anyone? I would love to hear more Aussie's stories of what they learned from school growing up about Australian history and if you think we should be taught the uncut version of what really happened. To this day I still don't fully understand.\n\nP.S. please be nice :) no trolls",

First off, they're not blaming YOU, they're speaking about how it effects them and they very much have a RIGHT to be angry and hurt when the effects of things like the Stolen Generation still bleed into today. There are generations of families still lost to each other. Try to think about how important your culture and traditions are to you, and then imagine someone coming in and trying to take that all away. Even if you were the children & grandchildren of those people who had that culture destroyed you would still feel the effects, feel that loss, because your history and culture is deeply rooted into your identity, especially with how in touch with spirituality and ancestors Aboriginal culture is. So no, they're not trying to \"blame you\", they're grieving the loss of something very integral to their identity and community. The least you can do is listen to them and not make this about yourselves, you selfish, ignorant, compassionless assholes.",

As a country we DO NOT do enough to support aboriginal people. In general, they are born and destined to continue in low social economic environments. \nThe government says SORRY in parliament for what happened, but then what? Recognise the MCG ground on Australia Day?? \nGo to NZ and see how the government are in vesting in cultural programs in schools to keep traditions alive through music and art. Kiwis ( even white Kiwis) are SO proud of the Maori culture and embrace  it  because they learn and RESPECT IT!",

Because you continue to force them to live in poverty and let negative stereotypes and <b> racist </b>assumptions fester. Because you stole their identity and way of life with no payment and no repercussions.",

That is only a stereotype, there is such a thing as discrimination as well. Here in NZ maori also get additional opportunities, their language and culture is taught nationwide in schools (the good and the bad events). Maori is one of New Zealand's national languages. Now compare how they live, in comparison to how the aboriginal are treated in aussie and their culture and language.\n\nPlease watch the documentary though, it reveals some of the dark history of Australia's past and the issues that still exist. John Pilger also did a similar documentary over 10 years beforehand too, so you have a comparison to see the lack of change.\n\nBut yes, I understand it is a tough problem to tackle. (Please note I am also kiwi and Australian)",

The day where we were killed or jailed for speaking or living our culture. It is offensive to Aboriginals because it's like celebrating all the killings of the Aboriginal people and like they're happy that we were killed. Today, the meaning has kind of changed. A lot of Australians will tell you that they celebrate it because they're happy to be in a country like Australia. However, to Aboriginals it's like celebrating that our people were slaughtered. \nI should also mention that Aboriginals would be more than happy to celebrate an Australian day but we do not feel the 26th of January is a good date because that marks the day the British came here.",

I guess the meaning kind of change the last few years to a day where Aussies celebrate it because they're happy to live in a country like Australia and its privileges. However, Aboriginals (first Australians, <b> black </b>Australians, indigenous or Native Australians) see this day as the day they lost all their rights, the day that our people started to get massacred, raped, torchered and stolen.\nWe do find this day offensive and a day not to be celebrated as its disrespectful to our people, culture ancestors and history. It's kind of like a whole country celebrating the death of your family. \nI think that made sense?",

If we go down the route that 'History is offensive' we will never celebrate anything.\n\nThe majority of celebrations of national days, liberations, famous battles etc. Are about one side triumphing over another.\n\nNone of the people in this video were alive to feel the grievances of the arrival of the British, nor were their grandparents.\n\nBut they were all born in modern Australia, which protects the rights of its citizens, outlaws discrimination and actively promotes and celebrates the cultural heritage of all its people.\n\nModern Australia day is as much a celebration of Australians as it is of Australia.\n\nSo, whilst the emotion is understandable, it's illogical. Move forwards - life is better that way.",

By that logic Australia Day is messed up because centre link give welfare to aboriginals because of their <b> ethnicity.</b> Australia Day is a celebration all Australians take part in to celebrate the good things of Australia, a lot of bad things have happened in Australia why bring it into a day that celebrates the good.<b>  Nobody</b> hates Christmas because Jesus was crucified and pretty much tortured, though people enjoy it because it celebrates happiness and joy.

This event happened 200 years ago. You weren't there for it, and neither were your parents. Pretending to be victimised by it is pathetic. Our civilisation bends over backwards to cater to your \"<b> race\"</b>. Benefit after benefit. You get job opportunities without any merit to justify it.  \n\nYou SJWs love to throw this non-argument out a lot, so here, have it back. IT'S 2016, GET OVER IT. \n\nEvery civilisation on Earth has been built on war. That's human nature, deal with it. Are you going to pretend that Aboriginal tribes didn't slaughter each other over territorial disputes? You people don't actually believe that Aboriginal weapons were made exclusively for animal hunting, do you?  \n\nThe simple fact is that two civilisations fought a war and one lost. That's not just human nature, it's nature in general. Deal with it.",

It's about celebrating AUSTRALIA that includes your nations, just because the majority celebrate today's Australia doesn't mean you can't celebrate the past. We acknowledge your past and Australia's past everyday, schools have to acknowledge the traditional owners, government. Meeting have to acknowledge the traditional owners, stop trying to put a bad spin on a day that is in all essence a day for everyone to have a bbq and get a free day off work, in order to celebrate Australia, if you don't like it, go to work, don't have the public holiday. It just annoys me that we give Aborignials so much opportunity and they can't give us one day a year.",

What happened to the Aboriginal people was at the hands of the British people who migrated here and a lot of that happened to the convicts that they brought here too but we have melded into a multicultural society that values everyone for their individuality and thats what we celebrate.",

If it was not Europeans it would have been someone else who invaded. So either way they were not going to advance or get very far no matter who invaded. Because this is what human history indicates what would be the most likely outcome. Second of all being an Australian myself and living in a town with a great mix of races it seems about 15% of aboriginal people are civilized while the other 85% are living off centerlink, hav<b> e alcoho</b>l problems, in jail and ruin the land they live on today.  You should see the way they treat each other and learn about their pay back system they use today, then if that doesn't workout they hide behind what they call white mans law. I'm not trying to <b> be raci</b>st, in fact I know some very nice aboriginal people. What i'm trying to say is people are saying this is very eye opening.... when in fact this is a very biased point of view buzzfeed would have you believe.

They've been here longer than anyone and we just disrespect that and celebrate on that day.

For starters, Captain Cook discovered Australia in 1770 - thats only 246 years ago. Australia became a federation in 1901 - that's 115 years ago. The White Australian Policy (A policy which attempted to literally breed the <b> black </b>out of Indigenous Australians) was created in 1901 and wasn't COMPLETELY dismantled until 1973 - thats only 43 years ago. Majority of these people don't know their grandparents and some wouldn't know their parents. To this day, their are Indigenous Australian's who don't know their culture, who don't know where they came from and are unable to find out because their was no documentation. They are known as the Stolen Generation. They were treated horribly. Imagine yourself in that situation, can you blame them for not liking Australia Day? Can you blame them for the way they feel? \n\nSo the next time you say \"It's ancient history, move on\" get your facts straight. It's modern history and still affects Indigenous Australians today.",

Obviously since these people are speaking Australian English they have been influenced by the culture brought to them by those \"invaders\" from that time. The things that happened back in history may have affected the people then, but I don't see it as affecting people as severely today. If people will move on and celebrate who they are today instead of frowning on the unchangeable events of history that have already happened, the world will be a lot better and there will be less hate all around. Focus on today, not on what has passed and what can't be changed.",

Most of the deaths were caused by disease, something the British could not have possibly have prevented at the time (even if the British didn't colonise Australia, some other European country would have attempted to set up a colony and spread all those same diseases). Most of the other deaths were a result of an inability to communicate and the inevitable conflicts a settler society and a hunter gatherer society will face. To be fair to the British the government in London attempted to exercise what control it could in a colony o would literally take months of sailing time to communicate with (one way) to try an get the colonies administrators to protect Aborigines (attempts at this failed due to having huge areas to police and very few people to do the policing) and to be as even handed as possible in any deputes between Aborigines and settlers.",

How about we celebrate Australia Day on the day Australia stopped \"the only whites can enter this country\" and on this day every one from everywhere can make their traditional foods Japanese foods, Middle eastern foods, Chinese foods, Mexican foods, <b> Indian </b>foods and even just a typical Australian BBQ. If there's one thing that connects people it's the love of food. It's the best way to celebrate Australia's open minded diverse culture we're known for and it's an amazing thing and the reason why I love Australia.",

Humans used to live under natures law, survival of the fittest and whilst under this law we experienced natural selection ..... the weak died and the strong survived. It is well known that there is an aggressive gene and a passive gene in all humans and during this time the individuals \u00a0with the aggressive genes survived, why because they were the strongest and the smartest. Ever since we humans decided that we all should survive together, natural selection has been taken out of the equation \u00a0meaning the weak survive also. In some parts of the world however survival of the fittest still applies and they are coming over to a land where it doesn't.....this spells disaster.\n\nYes I am both conservative and a believer in capitalism. Treat each other the way you want to be treated would work if EVERYONE lived by the same rule but unfortunately most don't.....meaning the ones who live by it often are taken advantage of. I disagree, socialism will never make the powerful and powerless balanced, what it does is gives the government (people in power) ALL THE POWER how much money you earn, what you pay for housing, what schools you are allowed to attend, the type of medical care you receive etc.... Capitalism however does, give everyone the same opportunities so that it is up to the people to choose where they will go in life.",

In the 1890s the M\u0101ori population had fallen to about 40% of its pre-contact size. Decline accelerated after the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840 and settlers began to arrive in greater numbers. This influx of people exposed M\u0101ori to new diseases, leading to severe epidemics.\nNewly introduced illnesses that were <b> common </b>in Europe, such as measles, mumps and whooping cough, took a terrible toll among M\u0101ori, who had no immunity to them. In European populations, such diseases tended to affect mainly children. Among M\u0101ori, however, they affected both adults and children, often with devastating results. Introduced respiratory diseases, particularly bronchitis and tuberculosis, also killed large numbers of M\u0101ori in the 19th century.\n\nSo, what's better about NZ mate?",

                    "commentText": "+Itzz Chino \nBasically, it was when European fleets arrived on the shores of Australia. The Indigenous people would have been ok with sharing* the land, but the Europeans classed the Indigenous people as fauna and it was legal to kill them because of the classification.  \nThey had called Australia 'terra nullius' (Nobody's Land) even though the Indigenous people were already there and had been for roughly 40,000 years.  It was also a criminal offence to mix blood with Indigenous people.  When the mixed <b> race </b>children were born however, they were stolen and forced to learn to live 'white'.\n\nWatching the documentary, many Indigenous films, doing Indigenous studies all through primary and high school, the compulsory course in uni, as well as having an Indigenous house mate really helped me understand what the Indigenous people of Australia went through.\n\n*Uncle (respectful term for Indigenous Elders) Bob Randall says in a \ndocumentary called Kanyini, \"You didn't understand the ours in this.  \nIt could have been ours together.  You started to go 'Mine'.\"  He said that the Indigenous people were willing to show their way of life and share the land, but they weren't treated like humans.  Even worse, it took until 2008 for the Prime Minister at the time called Kevin Rudd to give a live, national apology to the Indigenous people for everything that happened, especially the Stolen Generation.\n\nI can understand why they are extremely unhappy with Australia Day falling on the 26th of January and wouldn't have a problem with the date being changed to be much more respectful.",

The words 'flora and fauna' do not appear anywhere in the Constitution, nor did they prior to 1967. There was no 'Flora and Fauna Act' either. No legislation referred to or classified the Aboriginal people in such terms.\"\n\nSo you win there, but you have to admit, the Indigenous people were treated horrendously after the European fleets arrived. They weren't treated like human beings/equals. That part makes me feel ashamed, and my white ancestry in Australia doesn't even go back that far.\n\nAlso, who cares if they were primitive? That was what they knew. Indigenous tribes still exist all over the planet and live as they always did in the Arctic Circle, the Amazon, many parts of Africa, North America and Australia. Doesn't mean any of them should have been forced to live like people who invaded their land.",

No speaking our languages, living on our homelands, our traditional ways etc. they slaughtered Aboriginal people, torchere them, locked them up for the littlest reason and jailed them. Raped women, killed the men, taken and/or killed the children. I don't know exactly what Columbus Day is but from a lot of these comment I guess it kind of is? But yeah, Australia Day does bring back a lot of mourning because our people are still not recognised in our own country and looked down upon like we're savages and alcoholics who don't know what we're doing with our lives. It's really depressing. We're trying to change it though, videos like this can hopefully try educate people and get them to see from our point of view so we can try move for a change :)",

Thirdly, the Europeans are the immigrants of South Africa, their ancestors didn't specifically live in that are for centuries like the natives now did they?!

Firstly, should one's ties to the land be determined by how long that land has been occupied, and can you only say you are of that land after a certain amount of time? Because hardly any people group can say that the land belongs exclusively to them. Take China as an example, some of the earliest \"Chinese\" inhabitants were <b> black,</b> very different from the norm of today, but I wouldn't question the legitimacy of anyone's sense of belonging despite the fact that they are technically immigrants\n\n\nNow I'm not saying that immigration to South Africa or Australia was handled ideally, and a lot of what happened was atrocious in its undertaking, but regardless of past sins one should be able to feel as sense of belonging to the country that one lives in, and should not be treated like a fraud because your ancestors haven't been there as long.",

            "commentText": "Although I'm not an aboriginal Australian, infact I'm an Australian with a very European background, I believe this \"celebration\" should not exist. I find it to be a very embarrassing and shameful day for non-aboriginal Australians because of the dark history that it is originated from. The things our ancestors did to these people is truly disgusting and unforgiving, and it should not be a day to celebrate. Australia Day sparks a lot of <b> racism </b>and discrimination towards aboriginal Australians and for any non-white Australian citizens, especially Muslims. Seeing these people in this video express their feelings about Australia Day makes me really embarrassed and devastated that our government hasn't changed name or date of this celebration. I'm afraid it will never change.",

But we don't have to keep bringing this stuff up because we learn it in school and it's just depressing. I know some aboriginal people are oppressed in Australia but it's not were calling them derogatory terms and they call us nazis just on the street and stuff it's the fault of some communitys lacking the progression of the rest of Australia and we have apologized and stuff we can't do much more it's not like we can have secret police roaming the streets looking for racists also aboriginal tribes still do exist without technology and stuff so the British didn't completely make <b> a rac</b>e of people extinct and we don't celebrate that aspect of it we celebrate the aspect of bringing family and friends together.",

What I'm saying is, if I was already born in a life I knew even if it means living like a bushman it would be perfectly fine. My first comment was to highlight how your ancestors affected the native population, how much they took from these people, not to glorify your proud civilization, no matter how great it is now. By not even admitting the mistakes and negatives the colonists have done and only stating and glorifying the progress they have done is the most arrogant and self centered thing your people could say.",

I just want to let anyone who reads this to know, that I'm so sorry. Maybe there are other Australians out there like me who doesn't know about all this pain that the refugees are going through, all this pain about what the aboriginals are going through, are all hidden from us, none of us really knows the whole story and almost everyone here in Australia are left in the dark about this. We're not insensitive. We just want to apologise. And say that we are so... Very sorry.",

Aboriginals feel as though they are entitled to everything, and in many ways the Australian government treats them like so, with the handouts they so eagerly provide them that might as well be a livable wage. Aboriginals have the highest rate of crime in Australia, along with drug use and <b> alcohol </b>addiction, and in most cases they act like complete degenerates and are told that their behavior is okay. Many Australian students are taught to feel guilty for taking their land, and are forced to bear the burden of their ancestors from generations past with Aboriginals happily playing the victim. This trend of white guilt that has occurred recently is completely ridiculous, yet so many whites feel ashamed of their<b>  race</b> which is due in part to these biased views presented by Buzz Feed. If you watch Buzz Feed for any reason other then to laugh at the far left, then you have my dearest sympathy.",

If I victimise mistreat the child this child will most likely have behavioural issues and thats the same with how society treats its people. Giving handouts will only make them dependent.

I don't understand how a society can manifest groups that are marginalised and pushed to the fringes and claim that it's completely their fault. Though Native Australians have newfound rights and benefits and opportunities, it doesn't dismiss the fact that these individuals are still looked down upon with preconceived conceptions and prejudice. IT'S A CHAIN REACTION. You don't give jobs because you think they are murderers and druggies, and then to support themselves or their family, they're in turn forced into a life of petty crime to afford a living, and then they caught, and then the system happens again and again. \"Happily playing the victim\", maybe because they are victims of discrimination and societal abuse??",

People don't know about how Aboriginal people were mistreated, or how we tried to remove their culture in one generation. People don't know that mistreatment is still happening. In Canada, where I live, Aboriginal children were taken away from their homes and put in \"schools\" to \"take care of\" their culture in one generation. They were abused mentally, physically and emotionally. People don't know that that happened and that the effects are lasting still today and it's because no one talks about it. Our schools never educated us about it. We like to think Canada is a peaceful, accepting country, and we are in many ways. But we've also done some horrible things that are still being dismissed today.",

Keep in mind that the aboriginals fought back so the white Australians had ancestors who were killed too. This comment is not going against the aboriginals I am just telling the people who have no clue and are commenting with no knowledge of the situation.",

It's so unfair and unjust and the biggest slap in the face to our first people ever. So I'm done with Australia Day in terms of the fireworks and wearing an Aussie flag as a cape.

To only want to remember the good parts of being an Australian does not make you an Australian at all. People need to reflect on the past the good and the bad because it is a result of who we are today. The importance of acknowledging the bad by remembering it is to let our brains know that we should try our best not to let that happen again. It would be like with anzac day if we only celebrated our victory and not show any gratitude to the dead by not mourning their sacrifice. Those soldiers fought against an evil much similar to those the aboriginal people faced  that day and onwards. You most probably understand anzac day and its significance but why not this?",

Australia Day marks the day that the British first claimed Australia as their own.",

They traveled across the entire country, taking what they needed and replacing what they took to ensure that the next community to come along had food and water. The way they lived worked for them and caused no damage to the environment, which is more than I can say for the Europeans.",

                    "commentText": "+chaiTV I'm a direct descendent of Tasmanian Aboriginals. I've just spent the past year of my life doing aboriginal studies and my family has published about three books on the matter. Trust me, I'm plenty educated on the matter. It is quite literally my family history. Having advanced technology and medicine means <b> nothing.</b> It's great for us because it's what we were raised with, we adapted to living in a life filled with technological and medicinal advancements. However, the Aboriginal people adapted to life without those advancements and lived just fine without them. For 40, 000 years to be exact. They were more aware and cautious of the dangers of their environments because they knew that they couldn't combat poisons. They had their own methods of surviving off the land and it worked extremely well for them. And you think they didn't work out how to set a bone? You think they didn't have their own medicines? Not all medicine needs to come from artificial chemicals, you know that right? Sure, they probably had their tough times, just like people today do, but just because you couldn't possibly imagine surviving without technology and advanced medicine, it doesn't mean that they had a tough time managing it (again with the arrogance of thinking you're somehow better or your life is somehow more fulfilled because you had things they didn't). They suffered far more hardship when the ships came in then they ever did before the Europeans came. And all these advancements, whilst they did make improvements and bring to life marvellous things, they also came with their own set of problems. Some of them far more complex and damaging than anything that ever existed before. You're holding onto the belief that the European lifestyle was somehow better or more fulfilling because of their advancements, when really the Aboriginal people led very fulfilling lives. They lived their own way but Europeans were so arrogant to believe that their way was the right way. There is no right way to live. You can live in technological luxury or live off of the land. The only thing that determines which is better than the other is perception. There is more to life than advancing nations. Whilst advanced technology and medicine is fantastic, it isn't required to lived, and it certainly isn't some stamp of superiority.",

When Aboriginal people wandered down to Tas, they couldn't get back once the sea level rose. Stranded in Tasmania during the ice <b> age,</b> and here you are\u00a0 thinking they lived \"just fine\". Just because they survived the ice<b>  age</b> in Tas, doesn't mean they were \"just fine\". Not having sailing boat technology meant they were stuck. Isolated from their mainland families for thousands of years meant they missed out on the few things that mainlanders did invent such as boomerang and other tools.\u00a0 Look, I respect the lengthy survival time of these people, and their general connection with the land and nature. But their small numbers suggests high mortality and limited life.\u00a0 Their \"land management\" is way overhyped in my opinion. They would burn huge areas of bush just to attract roos who would come to feed on the seeds left over etc. It was clunky inefficient and only sustainable because of their low numbers in this huge land. They had no scalable system, not even close. What they did have was a huge piece of Earth all to themselves. Lucky. Okay, so you may put all the good things about their culture\u00a0 into a bottle, but don't hold that up as the complete story. Yes of course there was admirable harmonic qualities, but don't underestimate the fight for survival that took up most of their day. Only a few thousand people in Tas... no wonder their impact on the environment was low. Scale the population up and there's no way on Earth that Indigenous methods would work in terms of feeding and sustaining large numbers. Let's enjoy the stories of pre-technology times, and acknowledge the wrongs and crimes of some settlers such as child abduction and mishandling of land. But you'll never convince me that 40,000 years means they had 40,000 years of peace, harmony and happiness. Aborigines were keen to trade for flour and tobacco and many other things. If they were \"just fine\" they would have said \"no thanks\" when given those new things.",

And secondly, had you actually read any of my responses properly, you would have known that I already discussed this topic. I distinctly noted that I am grateful for what I have now, and that most of todays generations would not be able to successfully live without our advancements as we have adapted to living with them. But that is not at all relevant to this discussion. My argument is about how Aboriginal people lived very successful and very fulfilled lives before the Europeans invaded, and that they deserve far more respect and rememberance than was given to them. I am trying to dispute the very<b>  common</b> assumption that they were no better than savages that were better off when the Europeans arrived. And of course Aboriginal people fought back. They were being invaded and their people were dying of diseases that they'd never encountered before. As I said in one of my previous comments, evidence suggests that long before the Europeans arrived, northern Aboriginal nations had already been trading with fishermen from nearby countries and islands. Not to mention, every community spoke a different language, so don't blame this all on misunderstandings and language barriers. I don't care about what the apparent orders from Europe were, I care about what happened. Sure, language barriers and misunderstandings probably caused some conflict here and there. But entire communities were slaughtered. Diseases were intentionally introduced. Concentration camps were created (some of them so bad that they were inspiration for Hitler). Children were stolen from their homes. None of that happens just because of language barriers and misunderstanding.",

The first half of your comment I've already discussed with you, and I'm about to retype everything just for you. I never said there was frequent communication between communities. But when they did communicate with each other it was through dance and paintings. Which were and still are beautiful forms of communication if you ever get to watch it happen. Different dialects doesn't suggest conflict nor isolation. Each community had several different languages. You keep thinking that they thought of communication the same way Europeans did. If an <b> Elder </b>of the community died than quite often they ceased to use the dialect that the<b>  Elder</b> most commonly used as a sign of respect. Yes the communities lived apart. But that doesn't mean they were isolated. Each community had their own rules and were led by their own Elders. They lived and talked differently. That doesn't mean they never saw each other or that they hated each other. Yes, of course there would be conflict sometimes. Misunderstandings happen. People get angry. But there certainly wasn't conflict to the extent that there is today amongst people. They didn't just go around fighting each other whenever they crossed paths. And of course they had exceptional land management skills! Did you not read anything that I wrote about how they managed the land?? And so what if not all communities managed the land the same way?? There wasn't one right way to do it!! Many of them lived on different types of land. And who cares if they didn't all unite together to create one bi<b> g natio</b>n?! Why does that matter?! They didn't care about creating technology or capitalism. They didn't care about making money. They just cared about their community. They were happy living the way they did. You're so arrogant to believe that living the Europeans way is the only way to be happy. Sure they were evolving a little slower, but so what? Was it hurting anyone? No. And everything in life is trial and error!!! That's how they came to understand the land they were living on!",

But it's the only logical conclusion. Do you have any idea how many disease were introduced? You're telling me that every person on those boats just happened to be sick with every kind of European disease? Sure it may have been an accident in the beginning. But I find it extremely doubtful that it wasn't utilised to their advantage once they realised what had happened. Again, you only have to look at the sheer number of deaths in a short space of time and the number of diseases. And even if it were all unintentional, disease wasn't the only thing that happened to them, as I've said plenty of times before.",

There are people out there who suffered enormously from what happened and I do believe that they should be the ones asked about what they would like included in the commemoration. But perhaps acknowledgments of the Nations that suffered most (especially the Tasmanian nations). Acknowledgements of the stolen genrations. Acknowledgments of the European families who suffered for trying to protect local Aboriginal nations and children. These at least, would be the main points that I would like to hear. But again, it's not entirely up to me obviously. I am a descendent of a Tasmanian Aboriginal community, but I am lucky enough to also be a descendant of a family who put their lives on the line trying to protect and hide Aboriginal children that were being taken away from their homes.",

Haphazard record keeping from those times means individual acknowledgement is virtually impossible. This is not just a unique situation to this matter. Record keeping was poor across all walks of life back then. As I have previously stated the world was a much different place then. Maybe the families of people who were hanged will come out and say how corporal punishment was inhumane and seek compensation as well ? The families of convicts who had loved ones sent to the other side of the world, some of whom died on the journey, for stealing a loaf of bread or a blanket. Maybe they should also seek acknowledgement or some form of compensation as well ? Where does it ever end ?",

I'm aware that acknowledgments and apologies have already been issued. But it happened once. Maybe twoce if we were lucky in some cases, and then money was thrown at it and it was swept under the rug. I'm asking for commemoration every year. Re-issuing apologies and acknowledgments. Perhaps even allowing Aboriginal communities to perform their own dances and ceremonies. Just something to show that what happened isn't some dark dirty secret that we're trying to get rid of. It's part of our history. And it should be treated as such. I don't have an opinion on the convict situation. Though funnily enough that's how part of my family ended up in Australia. But I assume you're just throwing that out their to try and come up with an excuse as to why we shouldn't commemorate the Aboriginal communities. And it's a pathetic excuse at that. I didn't ask for individual commemoration. I'm not stupid. I know you can't possibly track all that down. But it's not to hard to mention  them all as a whole.

Women usually seemed more nice and open than the stuck up cunts in America who get too much attention, and the males seemed more mature.\nHowever just yesterday I met 4 Australian boys and 1 girl. The boys acted more faggish and douchey trying to impress the girl than any case id ever witnessed of Americans. Completely changed my view. Seems they adapted the American persona too well. (However I'll point out the girl was still nice. But the guys unfortunately blew it and lost my respect)",

God  built his kingdom and for many many years he tried he created many forms of animals to make it all work for instance he created fish to clean the seas, he created cows and chickens, he created four legged beats of the fields to work in the fields, but after some time he realized gods kingdom just would not work without gods actual spirit within the kingdom itself. So created Adam and eve and breathed life into them and breathed gods own spirit into onto them. He created his own special people known as the Awdawn. Aka Adam. He gave all of this world to his blessed Awdawn people (white people) and in return asked us to live in his image. So he sent us all around gods kingdom to every part of it to civilize and grow fruitful and manage gods kingdom in his own image. This is what we have done we have invented and constructed beyond belief. Infrastructure, space travel, electricity.. etc. This is because God gave us a soul and a spiritual energy that never ends. You on the other hand were created a long time before us back when all of the animals were made. You were made without soul and without the mind power to do the things we have. God gave you the brains to do your job. Work some fields and basically your here to do a job and part of the animal catergory. Some of you are hybrids dating back to when Cain bred to a female beast of the field after drinking alot of alcahol,  slightly more open minded only still without a soul or any kind of spirituality or connection to God apart from what from you were created for.. you don't realize it but the happiest place for you is to be where God originally placed you! Working for Adam and Eve's descendants in our fields. So you need to understand that we did not steal anything from you! God gave us this kingdom! And you will never know the true happiness that God intended for you also until you return to what God made you for. And I'm sorry but you cant blame us gods chosen special people to be like him for what God has made and how God has made it. The problem lies within you! Your trying to be something your not! God made you with 4 legs! Yet you forced your descendants to stand up onto your 2 back legs so as to copy us, God placed you in the field yet you continuously run off from it and try to live among us, you will never be happy trying to be something your not.",

I know what your trying to get at with these videos, but it seems like more of an attack on people who arent \"true\" natives of Australia. We cant change the past but we can change the future and changing the future for better doesnt start with calling non-Aboriginals invaders. Same goes with Columbus Day, I from the US, born here not by choice but because my parents family have lived here for generations, I dont like Columbus but I think the day means more than celebrating the man and more about discovering the \"New World\". I bet the same goes for Australia Day.",

And this is a new time now, we don't have a choice on what day we celebrate it but we can change the day individuals celebrate it. I feel sick in the stomach that people did that to aboriginals, I'm not proud that my culture did that. But that was many years ago, people in this generation didn't do it. So we aren't to blame cause I don't believe in it at all! \nI understand that because it was your people they did it to that it hurts you! But I don't take blame for doing that cause Australia has changed. And they try to give back for what our generation did, our schools are made to learn about it in history classes. \nI hope soon one day, everyone is Australia can come together and make a change! Where aboriginals don't hate or despise the word australia. \nI think it's wrong that Australia Day is on the 26th of January. That's the truth.",

There's always going to be people who put cultures down because of their beliefs, however, Australia is one of the most multicultural countries on this earth. We make efforts every day to mend our relationship with the Aboriginal population, we have made every effort to apologise for our ancestors mistakes. The majority of white Australians don't see Australia Day as a \"celebration of the massacre of the traditional owners of the land\" we see it as a celebration of the beautiful country we are lucky enough to live in. I feel as if this is a very one-sided representation of Australia and specifically anglo Australians.",

A south asian guy is winning an oscar this year for developing animation that is spectacular. Theres so much more that south asia has contributed to technology and even specifically the internet but thats all that came from the top of my head- i cant remember any more. Just because we dont boost about it doesn&#39;t mean its non-existent. Please stop saying white people were the onyl ones to contribute to the internet system we have now.

Therefore, we have to eliminate any books that reference any event before 1966. Okay now, given that criteria alone, warriors such as ninjas, samurai, knights, pirates, Vikings, assassins, centurions, trojans, Spartans, and even modern soldiers could not exist in a story because <b> nobody </b>would know what they are. We obviously can't believe in any major religion now, as even organized Athiesm is from the 1800's. Let's see. Oh! Scientific research would have to be tossed. Better hope an experiment can be replicated in that time because all former cases have to be discarded because, who cares right? All of those literary masterpieces? Ahh who cares, let's burn them! They aren't modern enough. And obviously white supremacy is still true because there is no history to combat me saying that. History is meaningless right?",

Its similar to the Native Americans and <b> African </b>Americans. This isn't something to just hackle at and complain that they are being too sensitive. Its honestly one of those things where you gotta try to see it from their point of view. The quicker people realize that, the better this world will be off. Let them voice their opinions and try to understand them.

They want to celebrate the positives if you hear at the end of the video, They aren't focusing on the negatives for no reason, they are focusing on it because that's what \"Australia Day\" is about,\u00a0marks the anniversary of the 1788 \"arrival\" of the First Fleet of British Ships at Port Jackson.

We don't go around and look down upon them all day. If the Aboriginals they have here knew what it was really about they would join us in celebrating it. It's about uniting as a <b> nation </b>not invading the first people that lived here. Another point, they weren't even alive when it happened but they all take it out on us. We get blamed for things we weren't involved in. BuzzFeed is only showing one side of Australia Day and it's the sympathetic side for anyone that's not a white Australian.

So I think it's the reason this day was originally created which is what angered them. I am really not going to take sides as I have no idea about \"Australia Day\" as I don't live there so don't know what it's like. All I'm saying is that it's nice they just want to celebrate Australia for being a whole country :)",

Australia day is honestly not a day to celebrate the Australia as a united country as a lot of controversy and turmoil breaks out. In all seriousness, Aboriginals are still oppressed and face a huge of <b> racism </b>in today society. Come on, there's even an app which encourages and rewards players to murder Aboriginals lool.

Many Australians simply dont care about Aboriginal people and want to ignore their struggle. That's what it comes down to. It's such an offensive way to try and celebrate how great the country is when it's done on the very day the first people lost everything. So many Australians dont even know this happened, because Aboriginal history wasnt even taught in schools until recently. \nOn Australia day people just want to have a party, have a BBQ, watch the fireworks and drape the flag on them. It shouldnt be that hard to change the date but here we are hundreds of years later still disrespecting our first people who are still suffering the effects of colonisation.",

I could see them setting up camp in South Africa, but thats about it. The rest of the continent is shoulder deep in political corruption, civil disagreement, and debt to even care about social justice issues (hence why things such as the illegality of homosexuality really can be chalked up to politicians shifting public thought from real issues to arbitrary ones).",

Yes this may seem surprising but Aboriginals didn't have domesticated animals ( kangaroos are absolutely useless for farming) . Since they couldn't domesticate animals for farming , they couldn't advance in farming and boom their population . With the boom of population they would've grown large enough into cities and eventually men and women would've taken control.\n\n\nThe other thing is Europe didn't invent Paper or gunpowder , the Chinese did . They didn't invent writing or the Arabic numerals , Mesopotamians did. Europe was surrounded by other cultures with their very own ideas and technological advancements and coupled with things like the Silk road and a net of trade routes ideas slowly spread to other nations advancing technology very fast.\n\nYou should really read some history books.\n\n(I also don't think there are many if not at all any farm-able crops like wheat and rice in Australia either.)",

Gunpowder is Chinese and so much more is thanks to other places outside of Europe.\n\nI'm not trying to hate on Europe here but Technology and Culture aren't the same but they often affect each other. For example the internet was created as a way to transfer data , look how much that simple invention has changed culture throughout the world.\u00a0\n\nAlso saying ALL of European culture was advanced is a serious mistake , Russia still had slavery like systems ( serfdoms) in place as late as the <b> Communist </b>revolution.. Portugal and Spain wiped out millions of native Americans and forcibly converted them to Christianity.\n\nNow what i'm saying may be a bit confusing but let me clear it up : No culture is superior over another , they're unique but not superior (it's like food , theres' no real better food , it's all opinion. \u00a0\") but when you have communication between cultures ( like the silk road , the ancient one) it brings idea from other cultures back and forth and these idea inspire some to do more research leading to more discoveries and inventions this is how cultures affect Technology . Genghis Khan arguably bought gunpowder from china when he used gunpowder bombs to invade modern day Persia and was witnessed by a European diplomat to the Khan.\n\nThis is why Native Americans and Aboriginals were in the \"stone<b>  age</b>\" because they didn't have much interaction with outsiders and since all of their enemies were animals or people with the exact same weapons as them , they never had to \"upgrade\" their weapons to be superior so technological advancement was slow. Also there was a lack of domesticated animals there so they 1) weren;t immune t<b> o commo</b>n diseases from animals and 2) couldn't do mass farming like the Europeans and Asians and Africans did which lead to 3) a small population and more isolated groups. Because all farming had to be done by hand. ( have you ever tried using a llama or a kangaroo for farming before!??!)\n\nNow back to cultures , waaaaay before the vikings set foot on Vinlan the polynesians colonized thousands of islands in the pacific and even went as far as south America and traded things like Kumara ( Maori word for sweet potato) with the tribes. They were excellent seamen waay advanced for their time , but to you , they seem like savages.",

Although Hitler is gone, Germany is STILL one of the most prejudice European countries. Chinese children, especially little girls, are still aborted as a result of overpopulation. Many Americans, myself  included, are hyper aware of the destruction US intervention in war has caused. We all can't just \"push things in the past\" because if we don't reminds ourselves of the mistakes previous generations have made then history will repeat its self. Also, you have no right to invalidate the feelings of these people.",

I find it rather strange and curious that anyone would ever say \"Oh well the past is the past\" so conveniently when they aren't part of the minority of people that was affected. Seems a bit funny to me, but not in the literal sense of the word. More so in the sens that it's just rather amusing that the same people who lightly brush <b> ethnic </b>and racial issues/history would also be pushed to dirt level within their own<b>  ethnic</b> background.\n\nAs a person of mostly European blood [very mixed in that aspect] born to Mexican parents as a United States citizen, I find it disturbing that no single white person has the guts to acknowledge what their people have done to literally every other group of people around the world. It truly baffles me sometimes how easy some are to remove the guilt feeling simply because it leaves a bitter taste in their mouths. I'm pretty sure minorities have more than just a bitter taste to what's been done to them. Ironically, however, I'd still be classified myself as a minority mostly because of my surname and my heritage [as well as my partial indigenous blood] so it all comes down to labels really. While mostly necessary, there is always going to be stigma attached to every which label being placed on anyone. It's an uphill battle for all minorities and all 1s<b> t natio</b>n people.\u00a0\n\nAs per this thread. I wouldn't worry too much about the opinions some of these youngsters bring to the table mostly because they still are learning and their frontal lobe cortex [like most teens] isn't fully developed so their sense of judgment is truly impaired. Take what these people say with a grain of salt for they know no better and were raised in a poorly structured household with tainted beliefs. Just be aware of that for future reference.",

I put far more care on the people than their culture, if they want to retain a culture that is NOT COMPATIBLE with the dominant culture unfortunately that's only going to work somewhere else. Thousands upon thousands of cultures have been utterly destroyed throughout history...and that's the only reason we are here today.

I think it's much better the way things happened...than the British as a military force considering the Aboriginals to have been a direct competition that LEGALLY had to be removed before colonization was allowed (as happened with the American military and the native Americans..)...because there'd be absolutely no aboriginals left, the hard truth.

                    "commentText": "+brioesque  sorry for taking so long to get back to you, one of your comments appears to be missing. I don't remember ever suggesting there wasn't military confrontation...the aboriginal military started plenty of conflict of it's own. What's more <b> racist,</b> the notion of struggle between two military powers with vastly differing technological capability or that the natives be treated like 'savages who didn't know any better' and should have been physically restrained but not harmed and broken down like wild animals? Both happened, which do you think denotes a greater respect?\n\n\"indigenous ppl did resist, strongly\" < Exactly my point. This was by no means a peaceful meeting, this goes back to my original point, that if the Indigenous peoples were considered true rivals or equals that must have been removed to occupy the land (the British were always going to occupy the land.) it's possible they wouldn't exist today to even talk about.\n\n\"we're taught this idea of \"terra nullius\" \" < I'm starting to wonder where you were educated if you were educated. The 'evils' of the white man and their 'terra nullius' are entrenched in young Australia minds at the start of their secondary education. From my personal experience history was warped to present this idea of 'peaceful' and 'noble savages'....as if the Aboriginals were simpler folk...more comparable to deer than man. Sorry for the strange speech, something about this particular topic seems to draw that out of me.\n\nMy main point is that Aboriginals are no different than any other uncivilized (by literal definition.) culture that come into contact with a civilized culture. They are human and despite their vastly inferior military power are still a violent and proud bunch who were crushed under the wheel. The difference is we don't morn the death of other cultures and peoples because of modern talks of 'white supremacy'.",

Rather than a conflict between both, while it is true that legally what the British did was in the wrong the Indigenious people didn't even have such concepts...Whether the British had chosen they legally were required to depopulate the land before it was their land or not the Indigenous (who were both without this information and found such concepts foreign anyway.) still didn't want them there. The only difference to the aboriginals would have been a much more direct, targeted and straight forward genocide to remove the aboriginal population from the land directly. I don't know how many 'half' aboriginals we would have today without terra nullius.",

God  built his kingdom and for many many years he tried he created many forms of animals to make it all work for instance he created fish to clean the seas, he created cows and chickens, he created four legged beats of the fields to work in the fields, but after some time he realized gods kingdom just would not work without gods actual spirit within the kingdom itself. So created Adam and eve and breathed life into them and breathed gods own spirit into onto them. He created his own special people known as the Awdawn. Aka Adam. He gave all of this world to his blessed Awdawn people (white people) and in return asked us to live in his image. So he sent us all around gods kingdom to every part of it to civilize and grow fruitful and manage gods kingdom in his own image. This is what we have done we have invented and constructed beyond belief. Infrastructure, space travel, electricity.. etc. This is because God gave us a soul and a spiritual energy that never ends. You on the other hand were created a long time before us back when all of the animals were made. You were made without soul and without the mind power to do the things we have. God gave you the brains to do your job. Work some fields and basically your here to do a job and part of the animal catergory. Some of you are hybrids dating back to when Cain bred to a female beast of the field after drinking alot of alcahol,  slightly more open minded only still without a soul or any kind of spirituality or connection to God apart from what from you were created for.. you don't realize it but the happiest place for you is to be where God originally placed you! Working for Adam and Eve's descendants in our fields. So you need to understand that we did not steal anything from you! God gave us this kingdom! And you will never know the true happiness that God intended for you also until you return to what God made you for. And I'm sorry but you cant blame us gods chosen special people to be like him for what God has made and how God has made it. The problem lies within you! Your trying to be something your not! God made you with 4 legs! Yet you forced your descendants to stand up onto your 2 back legs so as to copy us, God placed you in the field yet you continuously run off from it and try to live among us, you will never be happy trying to be something your not.",

The Spanish Conquistadores stopped those CANNIBALS from sacrificing their own children. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European settlers gave VAST LAND AREAS, larger than whole American states, larger than some European countries, to the <b> Ori<b> ent<b> al </b</b</b>>>tribes in America, Canada & t<b> he Afric</b>an tribes in Australia, where they have SURVIVED FOR 300 YEARS on their own land, because they were allowed to BAN ENTRY TO NON-TRIBAL MEMBERS, even allowed to use DNA racial testing to do so.

Or you could refer to Queensland Aboriginals as Murris, New South Wales and Victoria Aboriginals as Koori, for Aboriginals in the southern of South Australia as Nunga, for the Aboriginals in the South West of Western Australia as Noongar, I don't know, there's just so many tribes and so many of us feel different about being called what so I guess saying Aboriginal is playing the safe side. But the bigger known ones are the Koori, Murri and Noongar. You will hear a lot of Aboriginals from those states referring to themselves as that and/or their tribe name. \nI think that made sense.",
