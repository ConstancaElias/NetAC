        "postText": "A mum has said that primary schools should not be allowed to educate pupils about the LGBT community without parental consent.', 'The woman explained she found it astonishing that pupils would be taught what lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender mean before the children had been given general sex education lessons.', 'The mum, who wished to remain anonymous, said Heavers Farm Primary School, on Dinsdale Gardens, in South Norwood, had not asked parents of pupils if they would be happy for their children to be taught lessons on the subject.', 'She said: \u2018My Year 4 son is just far too young to be learning about all of this.', '\u2018He came home the other day talking about lesbians and transgender people and I was so shocked.', '\u2018They haven\u2019t even started sexual education classes yet, but they\u2019re being taught all about LGBT.', '\u2018I\u2019m all for diversity and for children to learn about it, but not in Year 4 when they are incredibly immature.', '\u2018My son has learning difficulties and subjects like this are very hard for him to understand, and I\u2019m sure he isn\u2019t the only one.\u2019', 'Susan Papas, Heavers Farm\u2019s head teacher, said the lessons have been taught as part of a \u2018Pride Month\u2019 celebration which both Heavers Farm and its sister school Selsdon Primary are running.', 'Ms Papas said: \u2018Both of our schools are celebrating Pride Month as part of our continuing work on equalities and challenging stereotypes.', '\u2018The children have been learning about this in many different ways, this includes Black History Month, learning about the Suffragettes to commemorate 100 years since women won the right to vote, and most recently learning to have \u2018pride\u2019 in ourselves and our families, and showing respect for families and people who differ from our own.', '\u2018We have a number of children in LGBT families, and we feel that it is important that they feel valued in our schools.', '\u2018This work forms a key part of our federation\u2019s vision and values.\u2019', 'Ms Papas added the Pride Month celebration is running to promote \u2018fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual, individual liberty, and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs\u2019.', '\u2018We are not teaching this as part of our Sex and Relationship Education (SRE) programme, and as such we do not need to seek consent from the parents,\u2019 she said.', 'The mum said she is particularly distressed about the school holding a \u2018pride parade\u2019 because she believes many families may not agree with this kind of event for religious reasons.', '\u2018I know there will be Muslim families who would find the idea of taking part in such an event a very difficult thing to do,\u2019 she said.', 'Ms Papas said there is absolutely no intention to cause upset or distress to any pupil or parent at the school by organising this event.', '\u2018We are planning a \u2018pride parade\u2019 on June 29, 2018, to which parents have been invited. This is planned to be a celebration of what makes the children proud,\u2019 she said.', '\u2018This can be what makes them proud about themselves and or what makes them and their families special.', '\u2018The children have been making banners to represent this and they will carry these banners on the parade.', '\u2018Children will also have a chance to share their work with their parents on this day. This is an inclusive, celebratory event focused on the what makes the children feel proud about themselves and their families.', '\u2018Our local MP Steve Reed is supporting this event and will be at Heavers Farm on that day.\u2019', 'Despite Ms Papas\u2019 comments, the parent still believes the children are \u2018far too young to be taught\u2019 LGBT lessons, and said she had no intention of taking her son to the parade.",

Now imagine your son or daughter is friends with that child, and they start to wonder why little Jimmy has 2 dads instead of 1 mom and 1 dad. Either you can give them the response of, \"because their parents are sinners and evil and you're not allowed to play with little Jimmy anymore\" and that does not answer ANY questions whatsoever about the situation, or you could say, \"because some families are like that. Sometimes boys love other boys, just like how in other families, a boy loves a girl and they have a family together.\" None of that even hints at <b> sex.</b> Because isn't that what we tell our children a family is  first and foremost? A group of people who love each other? Now imagine (Drew) that you're your child, who has been told the former rather than the latter. You go back to school and tell poor little Jimmy, who's just trying to fit in and be normal even though he knows his family is a little different, that his family is an 'atombombination of God (that's little kid speak for ya)' and that they are going to 'burn in Hell's fire for loving each other,' because that's what they heard from their family. How in the heck is the teacher going to settle this dispute without going against your bigoted beliefs? Should little Jimmy then be told, \"Well I mean Susie here is right, your dads are a sin against God, so I guess you're in trouble for yelling back at her and Susie gets off scott free,\" OR do you say, \"Well see Susie, sometimes families have two daddies instead of a mommy and a daddy, but Jimmy's family loves Jimmy just as much as your family loves you.. and Jesus.\" My guess is the school is sick of these situations and would like to prevent them from happenin2",

That was the same argument over desegregation. \"Why should the minority have the same rights and freedoms as the majority?\" Because human rights are always evolving. Get over it. You say you 'couldn't care less what other people get up to in their private lives,' and that you would tell your daughter, 'there is <b> nothing </b>wrong with two Mummies or Daddies,' then what actually are you upset about? Who tf is criminalizing you? Who is telling you to 'pay the DJ and bar bill?' What have you been made to do differently in your 'normal' life that is any way inconvenienced by the existence of the LGBTQ community gaining any kind of civil rights? Real responses, please. So take out the word 'normal' and what is really the problem with telling school children that sometimes families are made up of two moms or two dads??",
