You bash Corbyn at every opportunity, yet where was the same level of coverage when Boris was getting heckled up in Yorkshire? Also, how come you didn't cover the shocking reports/figures published yesterday about the state of the NHS after 9 years of this government? Virtually every other news outlet made that their top story and yet it wasn't covered here at all yesterday. Shocking bias. The most accurate part of this rag is the horoscopes and they are only correct 2% of the time.",
