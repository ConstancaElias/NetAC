        "postText": " In this clip from his Screen Tests interview, British actor Daniel Kaluuya ('Get Out', 'Black Panther', and 'Black Mirror') gives his thoughts about the systemic and institutional racism in America vs. the racism in Britain. . . . . A lot of people didn't realize I was in that, Daniel Kaluuya says of his first starring role in an American movie, Denis Villeneuve's 2015 thriller Sicario. 'I take that as a compliment to me.' The British actor, who was born and raised in London, completely camouflaged himself in the American southwest fabric of that film, and he is equally convincing as a young American photographer visiting his white girlfriend's parents in the very white suburbs in Jordan Peele's Get Out, which satirized the insidious racism of that setting and garnered four Oscars nominations this morning, including Best Picture and a Best Actor nod for Kaluuya. But offscreen, the actor has never been shy about speaking his own mind. . . . . How did Get Out come to you?. . . . Because I did Black Mirror in 2011. It didn't really have any traction at home, and then Netflix happened. So Black Mirror hit Netflix like three or four years later, and then Jordan [Peele] saw me in Black Mirror, and he said 'I've got this script.' We Skyped, and then during the press for Sicario, I went to L.A.. I read it, and I got the part.. . . . And with Jordan Peele, who is known for comedy, did you notice his comic timing in terms of setting up scenes?. . . . I mean, when I read the script, it was just laugh-out-loud funny. There were some bits that were just laugh out loud, and he leans to comedy, but I feel like there's moments in our lives that are really funny, you know, and actually it makes the poignant moments stand out or resonate even more because of the balance and because it's out of nowhere. I think he tapped into the fact that people use comedy as a defense mechanism, is to help them cope with racism, you know? It's like you have to kind of lighten the situation because if you actually be real and go, 'I just don't like it when you say that,' it completely destroys the mood, especially being from the outside like meeting your girlfriend's family.. . . . Did you always have an easy time with it? People must be very surprised that you're English.. . . . Yeah, people are weirded out. They're like, 'Oh, you're British, man?' And I'm like 'Yeah I am, mate.' It's tough because I just stay in the accent. If I haven't got like family around or my girl around I just stay in the American accent, like going to Walmart and stay in American accent, and then when someone's figured out, they're flipping out. But I think it really helps 'cause I like to improvise on set. Sicario was a lot of improvisation. So it's important to just have it like walking, because we don't think about how we speak, you know, and your character has to not think, 'cause you can see it on the camera.. . . . Do you think racism is different or presented differently in London as opposed to in America?. . . . I feel like racism's more pronounced in America.. . . . You think it is?. . . . The disease is still there. It's the same disease, but it just manifests in a different way, and British culture's way more reserved, so it's more systematic. I think in America you have the systematic and then you have the overt, but also the history of America is the deal of race relations, whilst a lot of the people within London have come from\u2014like, my family's from Uganda. They come from Africa, come from Caribbean. So they're coming from this culture, and they usually come from the Commonwealth, and have been colonized by the West. So we're navigating that, but youth... it's why a lot of black British artists are in America, because it's not seen in England, but it's felt, and it's oppressive, and it stops you from becoming your best you at times.. . . . So you would say the overt is bad, but the hidden is maybe\u2014. . . . Nah, I think racism just sucks, isn't it, across the board. [Laughter.] Like no matter how it comes out, it's kinda f---in' sh*t.. . . . Who is your celebrity crush?. . . . Angela Bassett's pretty. She's in Black Panther. She's one of those women that you just kinda stare at, and then she looks over, and you're like 'Oh, shit.' But my first crush was Ashley Banks from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.. . . . Really?. . . . Yeah, she's cute, you know? [Laughter.] I loved that show. It's an amazing show. It's so hard to make a credible family show.. . . .

I've seen students get in outright verbal jousts with social science college professors, because they didn't like what the professors were saying. In the end, those same students would resort to cheating in order to get a passing grade, because they'd learnt<b>  nothing</b>. Because of the defamation of subject area experts, racists see no value in learning critical thinking at a college level, leading them to fall prey to charlatans and false prophets who tell them to shut up and listen, \"we'll tell you what to say\". Consequently, they've supported woefully under-qualified candidates and mentors, all who go by their gut/instincts, rather than experience and intelligence. It's a sad day in the progress of our social revolution, when the  secretaries of at least half a dozen of our environmental and other government agencies, were opposed to their very existence.",

I think that the commenter DeeperThanMyThoughts explained very well and gave excellent examples of the racism/discrimination that is blatantly apparent; however, I will offer a few more on a personal level.\n\nA few years ago, there was a school shooting a few miles away from where I live. Two young white boys (10 and 12 years <b> old)</b> killed 7 people, teachers and students, and injured many others. They were sent to a juvenile detention center until the<b>  age</b> of 18 when they were released and their records expunged because they committed the mass shooting as minors.  I have a nephew who was an accomplice in a robbery at th<b> e ag</b>e of 16. The store owner or cashier was killed during the robbery.  My nephew was tried as an adult and sentenced to 40 years in prison because he refused to say that he killed the man. He would have gotten a lighter sentence if  he had said he did it. He is still in prison and is now about 37 yea<b> rs o</b>ld.  Now don't get me wrong, he should have been punished for his involvement in the crime and may even deserve the 40 years, but you are telling me that those two boys who killed 7 people should have gotten only 6-8 years.\n\nIf that's not a good enough example for you, how about this true story.  Two years ago, my nephew who was on the high school football team was practicing his drills in his backyard when he was suddenly tasered by the police.  What excuse did the police give? He looked like the suspect, who from my understanding, was actually a white man. Now, my nephew is dark-skinned and is nowhere near white not even in the palm of his hands or his eyes.  Imagine if they had used guns instead of a taser? My nephew would be dead. They messed up his arm, and he was not able to use it for weeks.\n\nOne more for you, I visited a predominantly white school district to give a presentation. On the entire staff, there was only <b> one bl</b>ack person, a man. His job was in-school suspension or security; he was also a probation officer. I don't believe that they could not find a quali<b> fied b</b>lack person who could teach.\n\nIs this demonstration enough?",

I would even venture that most of the racial tensions of today are a result of those last 100 years more than slavery itself.",

Those 100 years cemented racial relations in some ways, creating factions (to put it a bit simple): one faction wanted to protect systematic <b> racism </b>and started making Confederate monuments and statues celebrating those views, while others went increasingly progressive and started working towards ending systematic<b>  racism</b> and creating civil rights. \n\nIn a sense, \"the right to discriminate\" is part of a ideological vein in American society that shows up in other issues, imo. Such as the right to discriminate based on religious beliefs, which is also something many Americans are still fighting for. \n\nCompare this some other Western nations who quite undramatically just made laws against any type of discrimination.",

I don't know what your racial background is or your geographic location, but that statement is purely your opinion based on your perspective, upbringing and geographic location within the States, but that does not make it a national reality. \n\nThe fact is there are numerous studies about the racial discrepancies in prison sentencing for the similar criminal acts, racial discrepancies in hiring for certain positions, regardless of educational background, etc. \n\n I will say ope<b> n racis</b>m is less prevalent in certain parts of America than others. People have a habit of labeling the United States as if every city is the same, but the fact is every city, state, etc. has a different history and different social realities for people who reside in them. Even within the same states, cities have very different cultures. Los Angeles and San Francisco for example are both in California, but are very different cities from each other and have different social realities based on that history.\n\nThere are Americans who move from one region of the United States to another and have as much of a culture shock in the different lifestyles of different places as they would if they had moved to a foreign country. \n\nYou can't say the social realities of a person in a city in the state of Illinois would be the exact same as the realities of someone in a city in Mississippi. While I would agree that media often fans racial flames, racial issues are still a difficult reality in many people's lives.",

In Europe is easy to have <b> black </b>friends, you forget they are<b>  black</b> because they speak like you and have the same culture.\n There is no<b>  \"blac</b>k culture\".

They are the bridge of brotherhood between two worlds).\n\n\nThe contribution of blacks in terms of family decomposition, despising English and replacing it with Ebonics (good luck becoming a neurosurgeon with that lexicon. Language is a tool you need to master in its most sophisticated   form in order to create the most value) \n\n\nand stimulate a tribal separation instead of destroying that absurd apartheid you have that creates that \"victimhood \" so strange and characteristic<b>  of bl</b>ack Americans that at the same time is not seen remotely in other blacks in Europe and for Christ sake not even remotely comparable with blacks from Africa, who do not seen themselves as less.\n\n\n It is sad the narrative in the US is so wrong.

Racis</b>m, as you call it, against whites is no way comparable the other way around. It is largely systemic. Whites not only have a great rap sheet of hating, feeling, or saying hateful things about other races, but they have demonstratively made it clear about how they feel about nonwhites as well on a large scale, historically, and today! They have a history of harming nonwhites, whereas nonwhites history of harming white people is a drop in the bucket, not saying it's right at all, but making such a comparison is a false equivalency. So when nonwhites begin to react from being on the receiving end of historical violence and hate from white people it is understandable of how it came about and what fuels it. I didn't say it was right but understandable. \n\n\nIt should be normal for nonwhites to hold white people in suspicion of anything they do or to have great distrust towards them.",

Stepchildren looking for \"white\" approval or the elusive \"non-racism\".  \nBeing that most human beings are individuals who live, make choices and engage with who they choose, this narrative suggests that people cannot be happy and complete until the supposed attitudes of other people that have<b>  nothing</b> to do with them \"change\". An abstraction which would not change your personal life one way or the other.(nor solve socio-economics!)\n No one would suggest that white segments of the population should feel entrapped b<b> y blac</b>k resentments until every la<b> st bla</b>ck person holds positive views towards them. \n\n(There's a reason why this stuff is primarily pushed by white establishment types!)",

                    "commentText": "Tate, \"a lack of discrete boundaries doesn't negate the fact that there is a clear differentiation between some peoples.\"\n\nThat is the problem with you argument. The difference isn't CLEAR. You can't tell what genes somebody has for temper, intelligence, cooperativeness, creativity etc from just looking at their physical exterior such as skin color or hair style. Two people could have equal mix of <b> black </b>and white and look completely different on the outside. E.g. there are cases of white couples getting a<b>  black</b> kid and blacks getting a white looking kid.<b> \n\nRacis</b>m is about judging people on how they look on the outside, which has little to do with how they are on the inside. \n\n\"a lack of discrete boundaries doesn't negate the environmental conditions that different peoples developed in\"\nYou show you didn't understand what I meant with discrete boundaries. Your problem is that you think that humans split into these separate groups which lived completely independent in a narrow geographical area developing particular traits. That is not how it worked. Sure people DID develop certain traits over time, such as Europeans got white around 10 000 years ago, which is fairly recent. But all along people were shuffled around and mixed all the time. Human migration and mixing happens at a faster pace than genes change. \n\n\"by the way: i'm not trying to \"solv<b> e\" raci</b>sm. i'm saying that there is no point in lying to ourselves and pretending that everyone is equal.\"\nThat isn't my issue w<b> ith rac</b>ism. The problem isn't that people pretend we are all the same. The problem is racists pretending we are far more different than we ACTUALLY are. \n\n\"i don't think that all indigenous europeans are inherently superior to everyone else because they are white; it's a superiority that has been allowed to develop and be learned and passed on for thousands of years because of the environmental conditions of europe.\"\n\nWestern culture of course has had a strong edge over others, and I am not a cultural relativists. I do in fact hold the rather non-PC view that western culture is in sum superior to most other cultures. HOWEVER I don't associate that with whiteness as you seem to do. Culture doesn't get absorbed by genes. Until proven otherwise I would assume that blacks, asians, arabs or whoever who get raised in a western culture by western parents will be the same as white westerners.\n\nOf course we have to a very small degree been able to test that, because most non-whites in the west don't get raised by westerners<b>  and ra</b>cism is still a potent enough force to push people down who look different.\n\nWe do have historical precedence to suggest that they will likely be the same however. In earlier times when Irish, Jews and Italians faced a l<b> ot of r</b>acism in the US, they did poorer than others on most metrics. Irish were known as lazy, quarrelsome drunkards. In fact Irish were in the 1800s considered a <b> lesse</b>r race then blacks by<b>  many.</b> \"Black man preferred, Irish need not apply\" was not an uncommon sign in those days.\n\n\"it's silly to expect people who have been living a co<b> mplete</b>ly alien lifestyle since humanity came about to behave as westerners would in a world created by the white man.\"\n\nWhy, the adopted kids raised by whites I know, have no obvious different behavior from whit<b> es.\n\nYo</b>ur racist thinking is exactly there is a problem for people looking different to live together. You use your own prejudice and the problems it cause as an excuse to advocate fo<b> r your </b>own racism. It is completely circular logic. It is like mistreating your children until they behave badly and they use that as an excuse to treat them even worse. Sorry, it just doesn't compute.",

It's better for everyone to make it big in america because if you made it big in the US you made it big everywhere in the indurstry's eyes. Artists who've only made it in the UK aren't seen as famous or big. I mean look at stormzy, he's huge in the UK and has been for a long time and is getting big in the US too. A lot of people didn't know his talent until seeing him perform with ed sheeran though, but that's usually because that's not their type of music. Ed sheeran even though he techinically raps, it's all just sappy love songs that appeals to that sort of genre. Same goes for Sam Smith and Adele, you won't hear people who like grime or actual rap being into one of those.",

                    "commentText": "+AlphaBlackAce Here are just a few things.  1) <b> Black </b>American men do not promote phenotypically-looking<b>  black</b> women (like Lupita Nyong'o or Danai Gurira).  Whenever you se<b> e blac</b>k men in the media (or even regul<b> ar bla</b>ck guys), they tend to be with white or racially-ambiguous women.  If you do a search on YT for something like \"I l<b> ove bl</b>ack women,\" the majority of videos are by mixed and other<b>  non-b</b>lack men.  There are a small handf<b> ul of </b>black guys that started posting videos, however.  Even they admit they started doing it b<b> ecause</b> black men don't <b> promot</b>e black women, and it makes them look <b> bad.\n\n</b>2) Black men don't build or pr<b> ovide </b>for bla<b> ck wom</b>en.  Black women start and own the majority of the busine<b> sses i</b>n the black community, according to the U.S. Cen<b> sus (6</b>0%+).  Black men also don'<b> t prov</b>ide for black women.  Part<b>  of th</b>e reason black men can't provide is because they are allergic<b>  to ed</b>ucation.  Black men don't seem to realize that we live in a technologically-based society, where degrees have become the standard.  I'm from a small town in the south and live around a bunch of white people.  The only thing they <b> hire u</b>neducated, black people for is fast food -- and those jobs typically go to women.\n\nThis is why<b>  you h</b>ave so many black women going to school and bragging about their degr<b> ees an</b>d what not.  Black American women make up appro<b> ximate</b>ly 70% of the black, educated<b>  popul</b<b> >ation</b>.  If the black woman is poor, she basically knows that she has to go to school and possibly even start her own business to make it big.  Where I live at (smaller town in the sout<b> h), all </b>of the medical doctors a<b> t my l</b>ocal ho<b> spital</b> are black women.  Black women<b>  going </b>into healthcare of mental health is popular wh<b> ere I </b>live.  \n\nBecause the black men are uneducated, they haven't found a space for themselves.  Even when it comes to manual-labor jobs, white men prefer to hire other white men or Indigenous Mexicans (have a reputation for doing really good work, working hard, and working for less).  The last time we hired a plumber (white), he said that his family had been doing it and construction for 3 generations.  He said they keep it \"all in the family.\"  In truth, the Indigenous Mexicans have more opportunities (have their own restaurants in addition to getting hired to do manual labor) and are able to bett<b> er pro</b>vide than the avera<b> ge bla</b>ck man.  It\"s sad.\n\n3) Black men don't value marriage -- even though it's one of the easier ways for blacks to have access to capital).  Other communities value the institution, and white peo<b> ple ar</b>e more likely to lend a black, married couple money and all of tha<b> t stuf</b>f.  Yet, the majority of black American men (about 55%) NEVER marr<b> y.  If</b> yo<b> u thin</b<b> >k thi</b>s is just a black man-black<b>  woman</b> issue, it's not.  Even when black men do get<b>  marr</b>ied and marry outside of their race, their divorce rates are in the 80+ percentile.  The Census also tracks this.  So, there are just a few examples.  What do you have to say about these things?",

Of course, lets also not forget when White farmers take land, legally, and actually make it into something useful, whereas 99% of the land is left to ruin out of neglect, but then Blacks suddenly want that tiny 1% for themselves and end up throwing the entire farm away and begging for whites to come back once they have fallen in famine. When you are standing for something and have thought it out so poorly you are begging the very people you ran out to come back, your <b> race </b>and your political ideals are a joke at that point. If Africa wants to burn himself, they should do so humbly and stop asking for handouts.",

If we are to excuse our actions based on past injustices indefinitely, there will never be peace.  That is why the Yugoslav civil war happened. People could not get over the injustices of the past.\n\nNot to mention that grabbing white farm land in Zimbabwe was momentously stupid. They took farm land from people with long experience in running farms well and gave them to people with<b>  zero</b> experience causing an agricultural collapse in Zimbabwe.\n\nOf course I am totally open to broker some sort of settlement over past injustices. E.g. if too much of the land is held by whites, then negotiate some sort of compromise where they have to give away parts of the land or there is <b> a transitio</b>n period, where they get some compensation and have to train blacks to farm the land.\n\nIt makes no sense to be so preoccupied with \"justice\" that you do things which lead to \"justice\" along with more abject poverty. White Europeans sure colonized and exploited Africa, but they also built up infrastructure and industries which they knew how to manage. It was very stupid to kick out the people who knew well how to manage things effectively. It caused severe economic decline for ma<b> ny Afric</b>an countries.\n\nA better approach would be to try to find some compromise. Tell whites, you can stay, but you need to share and help us build a better future. You don't undo a wrong  with another wrong.",

So to try to pigeon hole me as a apologist fo<b> r racis</b>m is just intellectually lazy. You haven't done anything to try to understand the point I was trying to make.\n\nYou took that sentenced completely out of context. My point what not that you should not care about justice. You should. My point was that you should be smart about it. Don't destroy your own livelihood and future in a mindless pursuit of justice. Be tactical. Be smart. Throwing out all white farmers from one day to the other and put incompetent people in charge was a pret<b> ty du</b>mb thing to do. \n\n\"But you completely miss the point though which was talking about definitions<b>  of rac</b>ism. So GTFOH with your BS.\"\nNo, I didn't because I was specifically not addressing that point. I was specifically addressing the sanity of what was done in Zimbabwe. But if you care about my definitio<b> n of ra</b>cism, I'd say anyone regardless of skin color c<b> an be r</b>acist to one another. Howev<b> er the </b>racism faced by different people is not equal in severity, nature or impact.\n\n\"PS try telling the irish to 'just get over it'...\"\nWhat the hell is that supposed to mean? I am not Irish nor is this a topic I ever hear Irish talk about. It is however something relevant to know about to understand history. Like why did so many Irish go to the US e.g. Why does the Northern Ireland conflict exist. The British let millions of Irish starve to death during the potato famine. The capacity for cruelty by the British was not limited to people of color.",

And don't you dare say something like, \"well they can't help it,\" or, \"it's because of their situation.\" That's true<b>  racism</b> if you think they don't have the will power not to commit a crime.\n\nThere is no \"segregation\" in the housing market. That comes down to wealth, which surprisingly<b> , blac</b>k people can a squire if they don't fall \"victim\" to the above. It's literally illegal to deny someone housing simply because of skin color.\n\nPolice brutality isn't just<b>  a bla</b>ck issue.

                    "commentText": "Pittsburgh Bear ok I'm going to go through and respond to your comments one by one. I would like to first start off by saying as I've thoroughly read your messages I hope you read mine and realize I'm trying to have a discussion based on fact but at the same time I can only speak about my experiences as a <b> black </b<b> >woman</b> in America. \n\nIn general there are more people out of prison than in, but that's jus<b> t commo</b>n fact that not everyone is a criminal or gets caught. With that being said 1 in<b>  5 bla</b>ck people are jail. You know how m<b> any bl</b>ack people have been falsely accused and jailed? You know how many have been released. It is naive to say that<b>  all b</b>lack are in jail for the sole reason of committing a crime. I know it's hard to wrap your head around but I literally just witness<b> ed to </b>black men being arrested in Starbucks for waiting for their friend. Mind you they're two real estate brokers minding their business, but the manager and barista were uncomfortable which is an exact quote and called the cops. The criminal justice system is supposed to convict those who have committed a crime, but it's definitely not always effective. Their are people who get away with crimes, and people who are wrongly imprisoned because they can't afford a decent lawyer or trumped up charges.\n\nI'm not sure if you're aware of what the war on drugs actually is based off your statement but I'll assume you realize it's the American govt way to put an end to illegal drug trade and discourage people from using drugs. It's never been particularly effective except in the way that it's ta<b> rgeted</b> black people. We can go back as far as the Nixon administration to his aides admitting that the war on drugs t<b> argete</b>d black people. The war on drugs is the progenitor for our lopsided criminal justice system. The contra cocaine trafficking during the Raegan administration is another way the war of drugs <b> target</b>ed black communities. Drugs were literally taken by the CIA our if one country and shipped into the Bay Area and introd<b> uced i</b>nto black communi<b> ties. </b>Then black men were arrested and imprisoned at disproportionate rates because of bill Clinton. <b> To say</b> that black people are more likely to do drugs is false. There is literally no scientific evidence supporting you<b> r clai</b>m that black people are more likely to do crack or any other drug. So I would like to see your support for such a statement. Also this is the first of many times that you deem<b>  someth</b>ing as racist that'<b> s not a</b>ctually racist which leads me to believe that you don't understand <b> the def</b>inition. Racism is the belief in the su<b> perio</b>rity of one race over another, which often results in discrimination and prejudice towards peop<b> le ba</b>se<b> d on their</b> race or ethnicity. Although now a days we see it more in an ideological form from views left over from or systematically with policies like war on drugs. Systematically isn't exclusive to laws and policies I've experienced it more at the institutional level. \n\nGentrification exists so their is segregation in the housing market. That is a well known fact. Only 10% of people in the United States leave their socioeconomic status to a higher one. That means 90% of people stay the same or go lower. That's all<b>  Ameri</b>cans not just black folks. If you look at that 10% that leave their socioeconomic status for a better one 8.4% of those numbers are Asians and Cauc<b> asians</b>. Only 1.3% is black. In a population of 326 million people in which 13.3<b> % of t</b>hose people are black (approx 43 million) only 1.3% improve that's only (563 thousand people). That's disproportionate lower than if you do the math for other minorities. Just because the federal housing act exists does not mean everyone observed the law. If people didn't experience discrim<b> inati</b>on based on their race this wouldn't be a law, and it wouldn't be a law that was still in effect today if people still didn't break it. \n\nYou're right police<b>  bruta</b>lity isn't just a bla<b> ck iss</b>ue, but it affects black community at a hi<b> gher p</b>ercentage. A lot of bla<b> ck shoo</b>tings are caused by racism whether you want to believe it or not be<b> cause </b>the assumption that a black man has a gun when o<b> ften he</b> doesn't is a sign of racism. Why is it that cops can disarm and arrest white men who are resistin<b> g arre</b>st but when it comes to black men they're shot. Also please show me the law that says resisting arrest is punishable by death. Resisting arrest does not mean you can take your gun out and kill someone. The man who was killed in his backyard in Sacramento wasn't doing anything, Alton Sterling told the police officer he was reaching for his permit to show he was allowed to have the gun after the officer asked him to and he was still shot. If you can't see how <b> these e</b>xamples are examples of racism within the cop community then I would be willing to find another way <b> to expl</b>ain it to you. Their are racist people embedded with in our justice system, and again it's naive or ignorant probably the latter for you to believe that criminal justice system works 100% of the time because it actually hasn't. This is what peopl<b> e mean </b>when they systemic for of racism. There are people within instit<b> utions </b>holding the power that are rac<b> ist an</b>d use that power against the black community. It is a systematic form of oppression. \n\nNow that we <b> have an</b> understanding of systematic racism you can see how this <b> phrase </b>is applied to the job market. Racism only affects those who have been oppressed. In America, the only white people that have oppressed are poor white people. Other than that white people are <b> not opp</b>ressed and are not affected by racism. I once applied for a job and didn't receive a call back, when a reapplied a month later using my middle name which is French I not only received the call back but the job. My entire application was the same only my name changed. I also didn't accept the job. If I do a phone interview or Skype interview I try to make it so people can't hear my accent and they give me a f<b> air ch</b>ance. I'm not the first nor last black person who has had to do this several of friends have to do this and that's because some emp<b> loyers</b> have pre-conceived notions about black people. \n\nI've already addressed th<b> e group</b>s of people that have experienced racism within America. I can't speak for those outside of America. \n\n Now everyone has had different ex<b> perienc</b>es and if you've never experienced racism then you're lucky and blessed and I hope you never experience it. If you have then I want you to remember where you were, how it impacted you, and who it was. Take that feeling and realize millions of Americans feel that wa<b> y in a</b> daily basis. I don't know if you're black, I don't know if you're American, but we're all human and we will always share that. For you to come here and discount and invalidate their feelings and opinions is not how we grow as a society especially while uplifting your own salacious and false alternative facts. So please if you're going to have discussion about something of this magnitude remember your entitled to an opinion but that doesn't make it a fact. If you have any questions about anything I've said I would be more than willing to have a proper discussion as long as your beliefs are backed by facts and reasoning not just mere emotion. \nplease excuse any grammar or spelling mistakes I've typed this on my phone and I suck at grammar",

You're basically just asserting that there 100% is a<b>  racist</b> boogeyman out there, even if we can't measure his effects, and that I should just trust your intuition. It's exactly this intuition that I'm resisting!\n\nYou're right, I do live in a big city and perhap<b> s racis</b>m is worse outside. It most likely is. How much worse and whether even that is worth discussing is a separate issue however. But here is what I do know: Mo<b> st bla</b>ck people, and the sort of people that complain ab<b> out rac</b>ism like Kaluuya does, grow up in the big cities anyway!\n\nI grew up in a very multicultural area and I can tell you that, sadly, many of the kids that had disciplinary problems or were involved in gang culture <b> were b</b>lack stud<b> ents. </b>Black people all know that one of the biggest issues <b> in the</b> black community is the lack of good male role models for the young men. Unfortunately, without fathers to set an example, they end up admiring and inspiring to be the gangsters they know from the ghetto streets. I've seen it happen numerous times. But this isn't an excl<b> usivel</b>y black issue (although it is a particularly big issue amongst blacks) as we have the same problems with white working class \"chavs\" too. In fact, here in the UK, the worst performing group at educational attainment are white working class boys! What k<b> ind of </b>a racist society is that?\n\nWith regards to the police profiling, I've never been stopped by the police and neither have <b> any of</b> my black friends. I assume that's because I don't look like I'm causing trouble. My point is that, ju<b> st bec</b>ause black people are dis-proportionally stopped by the police, it doesn't mean that the polic<b> e are b</b>eing racist if you take into account the fact that gang culture, which is exactly what police profiling is fighting against, is dis-pr<b> oporti</b>onally black. If you go to the north of England where there are a lot of white working class people and a similar youth gang culture, you will find the same disdain for the police albeit without the racial component. There they talk about it from a class struggle perspective instead. Let me give you another example. Let's say that south east Asian people are dis-proportionally arrested for human trafficking. Does that mean t<b> he poli</b>ce are racist or that south east Asians dominate the human trafficking trade?",

There is no point of talking about something like hate over and over again.

You do the best you can in life with what you have, you try to be as fair as possible and you move on.

It is a terrible place where the more you feel like a victim and especially act like one, the more others will exclude you and you'll keep being miserable. You have to go out there and even with all your limitations and suffering that you experience(and we all experience it in different ways..for example some of us have terrible chronic illnesses that make us question if life is worth living at all) prove what you're worth because no one is going to force others to be nice just because you say they have to(it actually does the opposite). So the whole voice my opinion simply doesn't work(long term anyways).  \n\nFrom what i can tell, even though we've fought for so much, it seems that both Canada and USA are in a time where there's an overwhelming amount of divide and this is not a coincidence(it's been brewing for a long time because of pretending and people just playing along).

It's extremely easy to be an outsider looking in and <b> tell b</b>lack people how to feel, how to move and all that when you don't even understand the FULL scope of the complexities and dynamics of racial issues.

Some of you come and think you are being constructive and adding something to the discussion when in reality you all are just adding more fuel to the fire thinking it's water making everything worse. I am from the hood but I did not allow the environment to condition  me to who I would grow up to become. I don't see myself as a victim, I see myself as a warrior, a spiritual being just navigating through this world learning and observing and just happen to share this planet with some VERY low vibrational beings as seen here. I'd be more than happy to just drop it all and ride the 'equality' train...funny how we speaking on equality and not equity...(that's a conversation I wanna see)but we are clearly not ready for that and it painfully shows I hope we can get to that time where we are all TRULY, AUTHENTICALLY, GENUINELY equal and not some wool over our eyes type of mess because some of you are a little TOO tight....almost like you don't truly care for change, you just don't want to hear about it anymore just because it makes YOU feel uncomfortable which is understandable from a human standpoint but it doesn't make it right<b> . I wo</b>uld say black people should just drop it in exchange that you all drop, forfeit your privileges and advantage that y'all have over everyone else but we would then waste a lot more with some of you trying to convince us that y'all do not have privilege and advantages, the circle of denial that will ultimately keep these issues alive. It won't stop just by us not talking about it, it will only get worse and then we would have to do way more than just talking about it...hopefully y'all get it.",

YES! Men being negatively effected in the ways you listed actually IS a result o<b> f sexis</b>m!

It's the entire reason they don't show emotion as much as women do. Transmen going through hormone therapy have gone on record that they are aware of how less inclined to emotionality they are when they're taking Testosterone. The idea that society makes men be less emotional completely ignores the science of Evolutionary Biology. Furthermore Men also have different biological pleasure receptors than women do. When women are rewarded for being caregivers they receive far more pleasure hormones than if they become breadwinners. For example women entering advanced fields in Law drop out at enormous rates at around <b> age </b>30 because they don't find pleasure in it. It's also why women enter nursing, teaching, and other such fields in far bigger numbers than men. Men are breadwinners because they are more Darwinistically crafted to be the breadwinners.\n\nYou can try to change \"societal standards\" all you want, but you won't defeat 2 million years of EVOLUTION.",

Just because im light skinned but almost 100% completely Hispanic ive been frowned upon for being light skinned and being told how i should be ashamed of myself for something my realitives had<b>  NOTHING</b> to do with, infact they were in Mexico and Italy at the time. So what youre saying is we need to keep pleadin forgiveness and sorrow t<b> o blac</b>k people for what has happened to them in another sad part of human history? The Egyptians have been enslaved, the Irish were enslaved, the list goes on and on. And the more we hold on to these sorrows then the more likely we seperate ourselves as a society. Think about this stuff instead of saying 'we need to acknowledge the pain and suffering white people have caused against blacks we need to trust them with this and that etc...' ofcourse we trust them. And thats why theres a difference between learning history so that way it never repeats itself and just plain simply seperating yourself as a human being to feel sorry for another group. We need to stop saying 'im white and im sorry for what we did' then you just excluded yourself from even being considered as a united human on this earth.",

For me I think the important thing is acknowledging what has occurred. We can't simply \u2018move on' and start fresh without making up for what we have done. When I was in school in Germany, I found out that they had classes where they were taught not to feel guilty about what their predecessors have done, and that those atrocities are not their burden to bear. They've done all they can to make sure their modern society is a more united one. So when you see Germans commenting on how <b> crazy </b>the Trump ordeal is and how those Americans that vote for him can't see how their falling right into the situation the german people found themselves in in the rise of world war 2, that's what I mean. We need to seek forgiveness before we can move on and unite otherwise this is what we see happening. The german civilisation have learned never to allow that again. Many Americans have not.",

Every major fascist regiem has disarmed their citizen... the Russians, China, Germany, Japan, Cuba etc. so theres a difference as a whole what we should be doing as a SOCIETY and things we should do to stop totally dividing eachother up based off of our political opinnions.

I didn't say I disagreed with it either. As far as your question goes... I think you're assuming I'm American. I'm not. Believe it or not, Abraham Lincoln, and other politicians at the time, wanted freed slaves to return home. They believed the two races couldn't really coexist. Not to the fullest at least.\nAs far as native Americans go... The oldest skull found on American soil is of Syberian origin. Which probably means Syberians (Europeans) were there before the Natives as we know them. You see, that's human nature. That's human history.

Unless we all become one big<b>  race</b>, which only proves my point.\nYou didn't get my point about the \"true native American\". Europeans didn't bring them there. The oldest skull that was found is of Syberian origin. So it means, a long time ago, people who probably looked white were there before the today's version of natives. And when the natives came from Asia, they won their land. Fair and square. My point was that the whole \"land was stolen\" argument isn't a good one.

Muslims in general come from a specific part of the world by majority, just like Christians by majority reside in a specific part of the world. Yes, people of different religions live amongst people from all corners of the world but it's a very small percentage of people. And yes, there is a minority population of white muslims, but they do not face the same level of prejudice as muslim people originating from north Africa or the middle east. In general, if a person has physical characteristics of a middle eastern or a north<b>  african</b>, some people will sub-consciously make associations to terrorists and muslims. Yeah, you're technically right, muslims are not <b> a rac</b>e. However, Muslims do experien<b> ce raci</b>sm and so do people of middle eastern decent, thanks to a small minority carrying abhorrent acts upon innocent people.",
