He was so right when he said that greatest problem of lately in our Political/Parliamentary System is Lack of 'Losers Consent' - which leads to Politicians and public! not being able to ACCEPT Voters' Majority Decisions and instead of Implementing Results - they are being ignored, contested, distressed and skewed in every which way - for political gains and popularity. Basically FAR from Democracy we still want to Believe in and Respect. Is there any Point to more of these TV Debates?? I don't know. Wish GE was this week!!\u00a0------------",

Corbyn very much himself too - usual moaning, evasive, trying to put some 'evidence' out of the sleeve to stunt Boris with alleged Tory 'US Deals' concerning Medical Supplies to our NHS..That didn't work either Corbyn's way. All in all - Sam<b> e ol</b>d, sa<b> me o</b>ld.\u00a0------------- I was pretty much impressed thou by a Format of Second Debate conducted by Nina Hossain!And here I have to say - she has shown a different Class and interviewing skills we became so accustom to on practically all News Channels and..grown more and more appalled by behaviour of their regular Presenters!One, by one.. Nina allowed each Guest to answer her Qs without interruption, aggression, pulling faces, annoyance, intimidation, but Most of All - she was refreshingly UN - BIASED!!And indeed each Political Leader had a chance to put their views in very compelling way - without shouting, screeching, foaming at mouth - otherwise in proper and civilized manner!!Bravo that Lady!!-- -- -- -- -- --Never thought I could actually listen to Swinson, Sturgeon and Berry in full that 's a first!: The biggest Impediment of All three women is sadly their stance on Democracy..what Democracy!??",
