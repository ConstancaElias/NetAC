        "postText": "Yesterday saw US President Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s leader, deliver a joint press conference at which the strains were plain to see, with Mr Trump accusing his opposite number of giving \u201cone of the greater non-answers I have ever heard\u201d.', 'Hours later, Mr Johnson\u2019s bizarre embrace with Mrs Merkel likewise indicated the problems bubbling under the surface.', 'Mr Johnson and Mrs Merkel have endured a rocky relationship since he became Prime Minister in July.', 'In October, No 10 source claimed Mrs Merkel\u2019s insistence on Northern Ireland remain in the EU\u2019s customs union made a Brexit deal look \u201cessentially impossible, not just now but ever\u201d.', 'Mr Johnson today played down divisions in Nato amid differences over Turkey\u2019s incursion against the Kurds in northern Syria.', 'Arriving for the 70th anniversary meeting of Nato leaders near Watford, Mr Johnson said Britain\u2019s commitment to the alliance remained \u201crock solid\u201d.', 'He said: \u201cClearly it is very important that the alliance stays together.', '\u201cBut there is far, far more that unites us than divides us.\u201d', 'Mr Johnson said he had a \u201cvery good\u201d bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump on Tuesday evening.', 'He added: \u201dWe discussed the future of Nato, we discussed what is going on in Syria and various other matters.\u201d', 'However, today, NATO leaders appeared to mock Donald Trump at a Buckingham Palace reception.', 'A huddle which included Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Princess Royal was filmed apparently gossiping about the US president\u2019s unorthodox style on Tuesday night, although Mr Trump is not mentioned by name.', 'During the casual chat, as the leaders sipped drinks, Mr Johnson can be heard asking French President Emmanuel Macron: \u201cIs that why you were late?\u201d', 'Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says: \u201cHe was late because he takes a 40-minute press conference off the top.\u201d', 'Later in the conversation Mr Trudeau adds: \u201cYou just watched his team\u2019s jaws drop to the floor.\u201d', 'A video clip of the chat, filmed as world leaders met ahead of a summit to mark Nato\u2019s 70th anniversary, has been viewed almost four million times since it was posted online.', 'The joint Trump/Macron press conference came after Mr Trump branded Mr Macron\u2019s comments that Nato is \u201cbrain dead\u201d as \u201cvery nasty\u201d, before the pair met at the US ambassador\u2019s residence in London.', 'Mr Trump also pressed Mr Trudeau on Canada\u2019s Nato spending at their bilateral meeting.', 'Meanwhile, following an evening reception hosted by Mr Johnson at Number 10, a member of the US Secret Service was pictured leaving with a Christmas bauble gifted to leaders.', 'Each Nato leader was given one of the decorations and invited to hang it from the Downing Street tree.",
