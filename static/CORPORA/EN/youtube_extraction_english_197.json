It is more so with females since the media projects the male image as never getting<b>  old</b> like Donald Trump who can have a wife whos<b> e ag</b>e is equal to that of his daughter, and he still can have the most powerful job as being president too. Globally, it is a male-dominated society, and it gets worse since women are expected to put her children in day-care to earn an income equal to her husband when prejudice in the job-world exits against not only h<b> er a</b>ge but <b> her gen</b>der too.",
