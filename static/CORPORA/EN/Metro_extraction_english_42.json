        "postText": "Aidan Turner has done the shirtless thing again.', 'You know the one, where he\u2019s photographed without a shirt on, the photo apparently makes women start burning their knickers (though I\u2019ve not actually seen any evidence of this) and we all have to talk about the double standard of objectification.', 'Or rather, straight cis men who\u2019ve spent their lives never having to feel worried about being sexually assaulted or being passed over for promotion because their bodies are \u2018too tempting\u2019 throw tantrums about how unfair their lives are.', '\u2018Women are allowed to talk about how attractive that Poldark is\u2019 complains a certain type of man. \u2018But I\u2019d be in big trouble if I was talking that way about a woman.\u2019', 'This is an argument which entirely ignores the fact that one of the UK\u2019s major newspapers presents a topless woman on its third page for perusal over breakfast every day, and also ignores the fact that you are, of course, entirely entitled to find someone attractive. Or say so. No one is getting in trouble for saying \u2018My God, I have got such a thing for Victoria Coren off Only Connect.\u2019', 'In reality, what people do get into trouble for is saying \u2018I\u2019d really like to put my c**k in Sarah from Marketing\u2019s mouth\u2019 to their co-workers. Which, I think we can all agree is unacceptable. And for the record, if a woman was heard to be saying \u2018I\u2019d really like to sit on Lou from market research\u2019s face\u2019 the outcome would be the same. Rules are rules.', 'You can call someone attractive, that\u2019s fine. But it\u2019s less fine to make sexualised comments about someone and it\u2019s illegal (sexual harassment) if you work with that person.', 'What we\u2019re discussing here is why men are considered to be threatening when they provide explicit narrative about how much they fancy specific women, and women aren\u2019t.', 'Now, I\u2019d like to reiterate that I haven\u2019t heard a single woman saying a single thing about Aidan Turner\u2019s body. But let\u2019s accept for the purposes of this discussion that women ogling Aidan Turner is something which actually happens. Let\u2019s accept the theory that all over the country women are looking at pictures of him and having fantasies about Aidan plowing their furrow or whatever it is he does in Poldark (mining their tin?)', 'Yes, a woman doing that would come under less scrutiny than a man doing so. Just like male strippers are considered more socially acceptable than female strippers because male stripping is usually a silly, funny experience whereas female stripping is intended to arouse', 'I\u2019ve had a lap dance from strippers of both genders, I\u2019m speaking from experience here. Men do an amusing, bouncy dance to upbeat music and have everyone in stitches. Women wear outfits designed to arouse and take men into side rooms where they have to sit on their hands.', 'But you know what? There are a metric f**ktonne of double standards that run parallel to that one, and honestly I\u2019d happily lose my right to spaff over a picture of Aidan Turner (again, is ANYONE doing this?) if it meant all the other double standards being wiped away.', 'A woman is statistically less likely to turn that ogle into an unwanted sexual approach, and even less likely to turn it into assault. And if she did? It\u2019s almost certain that the man in question would be physically stronger than her and perfectly able to resist.', 'So if you\u2019re the kind of man who gets angry that women are allowed to call Aidan Turner (or any other man) attractive, I\u2019d implore you to ask yourself a question. And that question is this:', 'How is not being able to have loud, public sexual fantasies about women negatively affecting my life?', 'The vast majority of people who have answered this question have said, \u2018it\u2019s not that it\u2019s negatively affecting my life, but it\u2019s not fair that I\u2019m not allowed to.\u2019', 'To which my answer is this: welcome to the party. Life isn\u2019t fair. It\u2019s not fair that having a child means an orgasm for a man and the potential to die in childbirth for women. It\u2019s not fair that women are infinitely more likely to be sexually assaulted.', 'It\u2019s not fair that becoming a parent boosts a man\u2019s earning power and reduces a woman\u2019s. It\u2019s not fair that women are put on the shelf in their fifties and men just become more sexually attractive.', '65% of women have experienced street harassment, compared to 25% of men.', '1 in 6 women will experience attempt or completed rape in their lifetime, compared to 1 in 33 men.', 'Girls are sent home from school when their bra straps or knees are on show because they are \u2018distracting\u2019. They are told that their bodies are sexual and that their bodies reduce other people\u2019s capacity to learn.', 'Boys are sent home from school for having non regulation haircuts or the wrong shoes. But they\u2019re not distracting. Their bodies are not sexual.', 'So that\u2019s why women \u2018get away\u2019 with fantasising about the office handyman. That\u2019s why Diet Coke can run an advert where women stop to ogle an attractive man (and inexplicably drink a Diet Coke).', 'The consequences of being ogled by a woman are different from the consequences of being ogled by a man.', 'So even if you think it\u2019s unfair, even if you think it\u2019s an enormous injustice, why not try being the bigger person? Take a look at all the ways in which men have a much, much sweeter deal in life, and then let this one teeny, tiny thing go.",
