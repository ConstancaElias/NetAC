        "postText": "Boris Johnson has made a disgusting \u2013 and dangerous gamble \u2013 with his inflammatory comments about Muslim women wearing full face veils.', 'In doing so, he is making his case to be Britain\u2019s Donald Trump. And it\u2019s a cynical ploy, using his national newspaper column to openly mock Muslim women in an unprovoked attack.', 'He has form, though: as a journalist he mocked African children, then during the Brexit referendum he led a race-based attack on Barack Obama.', 'Boris didn\u2019t attack Muslims by accident. He did so because he was aware of how public attitudes are shifting, and he knew it was dog-whistle politics to his supporters and potential supporters.', 'The fact that he\u2019s refused to apologise simply underlines this. But this is who Boris is.', 'When the media say, \u2018it\u2019s Boris being Boris\u2019 they\u2019re playing right into his hands, providing an excuse for his unacceptable actions.', 'While there is now a panel in the Conservative Party looking into his actions, it has been claimed that a majority of Britons do not agree his comments were \u2018racist\u2019.', 'Aside from the old trope that \u2018you can\u2019t be Islamophobic because Islam is not a race\u2019 (funny how most Muslims targeted happen to have brown skin), and that people are actually far more divided when it comes to whether or not he should apologise (young people in particular think he should) \u2013 these comments take place within a context.', 'That context is rising hate crimes, particularly against Muslims.', 'Boris is trying to carve out an English nationalist space for himself, initially inside the Tory Party but then in wider society', 'It\u2019s the intervention of powerful far-right figures such as ex-Breitbart fake news network boss Steve Bannon, and his desire to create a new \u2018movement\u2019 to push far-right politics to the fore of Europe (Boris has met with Bannon, who openly supports convicted criminal Tommy Robinson, several times).', 'And it\u2019s Boris\u2019s own aspirations to become the new Tory leader at a time when the party is hopelessly at war over Brexit and hoping to steal some of the populists\u2019 thunder when support is rapidly edging away from mainstream political parties.', 'Nearly a quarter of the population remain bitterly opposed to liberal views.', 'Our most recent YouGov poll, commissioned this April for the 50th anniversary of Enoch Powell\u2019s Rivers of Blood speech, revealed that 41% of people believed that Britain\u2019s multicultural society wasn\u2019t working and different communities were generally living separate lives.', 'Yet 43% of the poll felt that Britain was a successful multicultural society. Over a third (37%) of all respondents saw Islam as a threat to the British way of life, but a similar proportion (33%) saw the Muslim faith and the British way of life as compatible.', 'Any politician who tries to appeal merely to the lowest common denominator, to the fear that laps within us, is also going to miss out on support from the large numbers of young people who have very different views to the naysayers.', '39% of people who took our Fear & HOPE surveys now represent these more progressive views, nearly 15% more than the negative identity tribes.', 'And such a politician will be turning their back on the very real changes occurring in modern Britain, where mixed-race relationships are becoming more common, where gay relationships and marriage are barely commented on.', 'One positive sign amidst the gloom is that, ironically, anti-immigrant sentiments are falling; according to our YouGov poll, 60% of people can now see and agree with the benefits of immigration.', 'But for all that, in some areas we are still a deeply divided nation.', 'Throw in the very real possibility now of a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit \u2013 the kind of sharp break advocated by strong Leavers like Boris, which will hit the communities that were promised the most hardest \u2013 and you have a tinder box atmosphere where the merest spark could set off a chain of events leading to very real harm in this country.', 'The stakes could not be more real but they are not just political stakes, measured in terms of which faction rules the Conservative Party, they are stakes that will measure how our country speaks to itself after we emerge in the post-Brexit landscape.', 'Do we want a nation that embraces a positive vision of the future, where we all have a voice, or a dark and divided Britain, coaxed on by the language of the Bannons and Tommys, where neighbour is turned on neighbour and a whiff of the 1920s blows over our shores?', 'Boris is trying to carve out an English nationalist space for himself, initially inside the Tory Party but then in wider society.', 'It is a dangerous turn that will only further polarise Britain, generate hate and embolden the true far right.', 'We\u2019ve had enough of his loud-mouthed, unashamed racism, which is why we\u2019ve said it\u2019s time for the Tories to suspend the whip from the former foreign secretary.",

And don't say it is because 'most Muslims are brown'. That's a gross mischaracterization.There are millions of 'brown' people in  who are not Muslims but are instead Yazidis, Christians, Zoroastrians, atheists, Hindus, Skikhs or Buddhists. There are also many 'black' Muslims, and 'white' ones for that matter. Religion is something people can choose- not lik<b> e rac</b>e. We don't say critcizing Judaism, Christianity or any other religion is 'racist' so why should Islam have special status?",

The UK is a true democracy. The EU only has the appearance of a democracy in that they have MEP's that are voted into office by the 27 countries. But, in reality, they have no power at all. The top brass, President etc are all 'appointed'. It is based on the model of the <b> old </b>Soviet Union. The true power of the EU lies fairly and squarely with Germany and the Global elites such as George Soros &amp; Goldman Sachs &amp; etc. The EU is in fact the Fourth Reich. The 27 nations remaining do not understand democracy because they have never had a truly democratic government which is why they have been deceived into believing that the EU is a democracy.WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE.How many times must Great Britain have to rescue the Eurpean nations from their dictators?

A rule still implemented today in many Islamic states. But this is the yardstick by which you claim Christianity alone is comparable to Nazism. Hitler in fact believed that homosexuality was a form of an evolutionary and genetic deviance, which marked out people as 'weaker' and so unworthy of life. Basic <b> Eugenics.</b> Not much to do with religion.Hilter expressed disdain for Chrisitianity on several occasions, usually for its supposed connections to Judaism and 'weakness'. He also expessed praise for Islam on a couple of occasions, because he saw it as a strong militaristic religion: although he disliked people from Asian countries.  [LINK]  some research on how many Chisistians opposed Hilter; and Muslims too, but also on Hajj Amin al Husseni, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. A known Nazi-sympathizer and collaborator. You might want to look up how many people were murdered under<b>  communist</b> regimes too, y'know just for some balance.",

Now you can\u2019t legislate against an irrational fear, take spiders or heights as an example, and then given the well documented atrocities being perpetrated in the name of Islam is it entirely irrational ?Now the idea of wearing a garment that covers a person completely, which the ignorant claim is a religious requirement, it isn\u2019t, in fact in Muslim nations such as Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia it is banned.Women who are forced to wear it by male members of their family liken it to wearing a school skirt from to bottom with horrendously loud noise every time yo move and very restricted vision whilst being unbearably hot.
