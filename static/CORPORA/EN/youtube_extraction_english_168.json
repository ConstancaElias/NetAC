At one point in my life, I was young an<b> d disable</b>d and I will <b> be o</b>ld; thus needing someone's generosity but plan and simple kindness. If you do a good thing then surely it will come back to you. Most importantly, we should have good humanity towards all living creatures. However if it is not in you to give then God will take care of it, one way or another. The references to the brother in a negative way is just not nice nor fair on the basis that he is trying hard to be a beacon of higher self for <b> our r</b>ace of people. If truth be told this is who we are since the beginning of time!!! I agree completely in what he is teaching and showing for all to see. Even if you still disagree, why can't be just try harder to make a positive difference to another human being?",

They make between 300 pesos to 700 pesos A DAY!!!!! in a good store and that's a lot in the Mexican way of life!!!\nHow do I know, I've got<b>  elderly</b> friends who've told me such.\nAND WE ALL TIP THEM AT LEAST 5 PESOS FOR THEIR BAGGING!  Gosh below that amount, we Mexican guys would say, would  think: YOU'RE A SON OF A BITCH!+\nBut again Negrito it all depends on the neighbourhood of the store (location)!",
