I don't mean poor hygiene or bad sweating, just their natural scents.  Ironically the more artificial fragrances they wear the WORSE they smell.  But I have noticed older men smell is usually the most off-putting to me.  What's cruel is that my friends and family treat my hypersensitivity like an 'allergy' to be 'cured' by chronic, repeated exposure to the offensive odors.  They constantly force me into 'incidental' situations where nasty people walk or stand very close to me, forcing me to smell them.  In extreme case I suffer severe symptoms including headaches, sore throat, runny nose and eyes, inflamed skin, etc.  The extreme stress is also debilitating and causes anxiety.  I suffer every day of my life because of this 'therapy' and I am no healthier or happier because of it.  I will never forget or forgive the excessive and unnecessary cruelty.  Asking for a little personal space so I don't gag on your private odors isn't expecting a lot.",

I swear, just the other day I saw someone who has that smell (he's 83) and after he hugged me and I walked away, I had that smell ALL OVER ME.

Even more interracial commercials being shown. \nDude if you have no kids then your money will be yours (if you dont have kids).\nStay away from student loans. Only get them  if you know what you wanna study. or  else thats a lot of debt for no degree. \nSTUDY SOME SOFT SKILLS so you can become self employed if times get tough.

But we all have the Grass is Greener thoughts.\nPersonally  I'd rather sudden death than terminal illness. The slow decay of a person just prolongs the pain. \nCuz I still use present tense when speaking of him. Cuz past tense cues people of his DEATH. And I'm like we all gonna die. Focus on what we can do in life and live in the legacy made. My dad is a smart guy my dad is a caring person. My dad is a planner. \nInstead of saying was. Especially when I  want to talk about him to a stranger. \nCuz all people gonna say is the same stupid stuff. Oh I'm sorry about your loss. Oh what happened. Resetting me to day 1 of PAIN.\nJust understand we all feel pain in a different way. All I know is I just want to grieve by myself. Cuz bad thoughts come. \nSucicide (i have more I'm  living for) \nDepression (try to find positive things to think about)\nloneliness (i had other family memeber to be lonely with) \nDecreased appetite \nReduced energy\nI DONT TAKE PILLS BTW so dont suggest. It just natural emotions so i ride those waves of sadness but I  tell myself not to go in too deep. Time will heal not medicine.",

In fact, they often can be happier than ever.\n\nWishing that they were dead long before you were born will only return to haunt you when they will actually die and your feelings of love will remain, while feelings of frustration and anger will go away.\n\nWhat helps is trying to be aware of yourself and not letting your love towards close ones drive you to negative or hateful thoughts. Just letting go and living the moment are banalities, but they actually do have very important meaning people often forget. \n\nI'm sorry but this doesn't at all seem like what you were talking about...",

I was born in South Africa, and noticed that the <b> African </b>Americans in America have the same scent as the native Africans in my home country.  It's not bad, it's just different.  Sort of musky, I guess?  While it may be partially due to diet, I think the diet of native Africans and<b>  African</b> Americans differs quite significantly, while the scent is the same.  All people have their own smell, and especially when you visit their house, you notice everyone's home has their own unique smells.  It depends on your genes, and the scents are mostly to discourage inbreeding.  Evolutionarily, almost all mammals prefer breeding with another individual with a moderate difference in genetic makeup - not too similar (inbreeding) but not too dissimilar either.  \n\nAs for the change in the smell of <b> a woma</b>n, it's due to hormones - hormones are released in the skin all the time, and bacteria on your skin breaks them down into certain volatile compounds.  Since<b>  a wom</b>an's hormones changes depending on her cycle, her scent will change as well.  Cortisol also changes scent, and menstruation is more stressful than non-menstruation, so extra cortisol is released.  I think all women probably have slightly different scents depending on their cycle, but the degree of the change might just not be high enough for you to notice them with everyone.\n\nAnd for the foods, certain compounds in foods, especially foods high in sulfur like garlic and onions can come out through your sweat glands, where bacteria break them down into volatile compounds that you can smell.  The exception being East Asians, who lack the gene for the large sweat gland variant, so they only have the smaller sweat glands that are too small for most smelly chemicals to be released through.  That's why East Asians don't typically need to wear deodorant, and very rarely smell bad.",

She could also easily sniff out when someone was horny (considering she has very little social tact, and was quick to comment about things, she ended up embarrassing people quite often). I can only smell that smell under certain circumstances, and most of the time not at all.

My nose is unusually keen and I overreact to a few smells. For instance, if someone is sweaty, I can smell it from up to 10m. This hypersensitivity to some smells  can result in sneezing or even vomiting in rare cases. In my case, I had a colleague and she had a very recognisable scent. For some time I couldn't smell her and then she started to smell a bit like those spice spiked oranges some have at home, just a bit more aromatic. First I thought it was just a <b> weird </b>perfume, but then I noticed that it occurred semi regularly and always shifted to a smell reminiscent of moist furr and raw meat getting smoked and for about three days she smelled horribly of smoke. During that time, I would be able to smell her a minute after she walked by. Her office smelt of her for at least 6h after she left. I asked others but they never noticed it, so I thought I was going insane. Still, it was so strong that I would sneeze, if she got too close and I really wondered about how often she washed herself. I developped the creepy habit of greeting her by her name before I could actually see her. I never said it without later seeing her, so it could hardly be only imagination that I was able to smell her around corners and through doors. In one case I was looking for my colleagues on a Christmas market, which was very crowded and full of smells, yet the first thing I noticed was her smell before I could see or hear any of my colleagues, so I actually tried to track her and it worked. I was so close to complain about her hygiene since she really upset my nose in proximity.\nThe funny thing: later a colleague told me that he could tell when another coworker had her period due to her smell, but I could hardly smell it in her case and he could not smell what I could smell either.",

There have been a number of times that I figure out what someone eat, and very accurately too, by just standing next to them.\n\nI too have noticed that<b>  Black</b> and Latino people definitely have their own scents. As a high wrestlers, I can assure you of that. Not having much close contact with Asian people I can't speak on their smell.\n\nIt's strange what you pick up on once you actually pay attention to them.",
