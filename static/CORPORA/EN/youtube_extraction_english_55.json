As a former biologist who has gone 'social' in archaeology, I think I understand your position a bit, but social theory will never make cases as hard as physics, reasons being that perception has a far greater role in these studies. Unlike chemistry and physics it's much easier to drive an axe in social theory, but this does not mean class or <b> gender </b>differences do not exist and should not be fought. And fighting it will always lead to new inequalities or off messages, that's really hard to prevent.  I like your video's on feminism for opening my eyes on just critique, but in the end I do think you are not the expert here. ;-) Of course, feminist make the same mistakes as men do in their propaganda: they're both human.",

Be what you want, I could not give a toss as long as you are smiling but please don't bitch at me for not knowing what mystery fucking label you've stuck on yourself this week. \n\n\nAs for feminism, there are good feminists and bad feminists, the good feminists are mostly older, they fought and got various gains for women over the decades post WW2, then there is this modern lot, who are frankly so bizarre in their thinking that they seem to alienate people like me who would have been more than supportive of traditional feminism.",

HuffPost is pushing female candidates because it knows they stand very little chance of winning. At the same time, HuffPost is not so surreptitiously trying to make Biden look creepy by joining the other trolls and calling him \"Uncle Joe.\" HuffPost broadcasts every negative thing they can find about males but totally disregards feminist women. Lucy Flores is also a troll trying to drum up support for the GOP by weakening our best hope to beat Trump. The GOP and NRA used Leeann Tweeden to oust Al Franken--one person who really stood up for women but also dealt a blow to Republicans. Feminists are falling right into the trap and are being used. They will have no one to blame but themselves when all the rights they have gained are gone.",

To them, it is their God-given right to be perfectly happy at all times no matter how much it may cost others. As a means of defense, these satanic creatures can produce shill noises with their voice boxes. These shrieking sounds are known to desensitize weak-minded or brainwashed men and turn them into their personal boot-lickers. Another interesting defense mechanism these animals have is the ability to scream the words 'racist,' 'sexist,' 'homophobe,' xenophobe,' etc when confronted with logic, science, and other forms of factual evidence that utterly debunk that which they claim to be unfair/oppressive/triggering. Due to our overly politically-correct society and a government with an extreme-leftist agenda, this ability allows feminists to effectively put an end to that which they find non-compliant to their sadistic values. Another defense measure these creatures have is ability to whine, cry, and throw tantrums until the men around them become overwhelmed with their chivalrous tendencies and presents said animal with whatever it wants on a silver platter or until the government forces the stronger, more mentally-stable men to disregard their better judgement and accommodate this demonic animal with money, power, etc. A feminist's prime purpose in society is to destroy it and eradicate the very men that made Western Civilization and gave it the freedom to be a total <b> brat </b>in the first place. \n\nHow can you identify a feminist? It's simple. Feminists are known for being ugly all the way around due to the fact that the government pampers them with taxpayers' money in the form of welfare. As a result of the government's intervention, these creatures have no incentive to attract a man who will take care of them since they are incapable of taking care of themselves. They do not feel the need to keep up their appearance or strive to be even slightly pleasant in any way which has given rise to this hated species of shrieking, blue-haired balls of<b>  fat</b> bouncing around in the inner cities. Needless to say, they are easily identified. Many have short, men-style haircuts which are dyed ridiculous colors as if the faces below them aren't ugly enough. Some othe<b> r commo</b>n animals one can compare them to include walruses, elephants, elephant seals, whales a<b> nd pi</b>gs. Besides multiple towers<b>  of </b>fat rolls terracing the globular physiques jiggling beneath their blue topknots, feminists have an abundance of facial piercings so to make themselves look as ugly as possible. A feminist call varies due to circumstances but when triggered, most randomly scream 'rape,' 'sexism,' 'racism,' etc when a man, especially a white man, attacks them with sound logic. After all, their motto is 'if ya cain't win with reason, go fir volume.' One may usually find feminists wearing the most outrages forms of clothing and makeup both of which work to accentuate their hideousness. Simply find the ugliest life form on any given city street and you can safely bet it's a feminist. Approach with caution.",

It's kind of scary to think ideology with the power of the Internet, leads to people think just because they say it... it's true. Regardless if the facts prove otherwise.\n\nand where is the equality in the world? why does it have to be men against women, women against men. Why can't see see ourselves as people. Same thing with <b> racism </b>I think. I grew up in an<b>  age</b> where I never saw color o<b> r se</b>x as a separation of any reason. It's o my been since my 20s+ that I'm taught I'm an asshole for being a white man... even though personally I feel everyone stands on who they are and what they do, then because of where they came from or skin color <b> or gend</b>er.\n\nThe more I watch these videos, the more I feel I just need to disconnect more from society because society has very drastically different views than I do.\n\nSadly this is not how I want my daughter to grow up. I want her to hold the true American dream to be all that you can be...  or because she is a white / female / American / hetero or whatever. Because she is who she is and she's going to kick ass at whatever she wants to do... EQUAL to the Asi<b> an, Bl</b>ack, British, Male, Fem<b> ale, Ge</b>nder whatever ... that her skills and determination is what grants her the goals she wants to obtain!",

Clooney has a much bigger pull to movies he is in than the other women. That means the movie producers get a lot more money when he is in them and thus he is paid more. If they pay stars who pull less audience equally much then they lose money. I know its over you heads, but there it is.",

But in a channel which discusses and promotes reason itself, yelling \"haha, they set themselves up for non-reasoning people\" seems off-topic, and even childish. Besides, who do they care about, their readers or their critics? Their readers aren't going to yell irony. They're going to say \"yeah! and we're the one outlet that doesn't fall to that standard\". Their critics? Who cares?\n\nAnd again, your analogy doesn't fit. Graphically reminding your customer that there is death and suffering required for their purchase doesn't compare to potential hypocrisy.",

In the area that TF was discussing - how things play with an audience - the intelligent choice is most often based on image and not logic.\n\nFor example, one of the prime software products I used and resold in designing and implementing business process automation was made by a small company, but was by far the best product on the market in it's niche. It was also less than 1/4 the cost of the far inferior Adobe solution in the same market.\n\nLogic would tell you that Adobe should never have been able to beat us head to head - but with large corporations and government agencies, they often did. The solution this software company came up with was to triple their price with the next point release. There were no important upgrades or value adds in that release - the only serious change was the price. Sales more than doubled that year.\n\nThis is because the image put forth by our low price was that this was not truly enterprise level software.\n\nThis is much the same - the image contradicts the narrative, and the image is usually more important.",

Of course white people have to think about<b>  race</b> on a daily basis, because if a white person says practically anything about any other skin color they get it rammed down their throat and called privileged an<b> d racis</b>t. I'm not even joking when I say that I actually had an very extreme experience recently where I said in a conversation, \"I don't really like Mexican food\" and someone literally called <b> me raci</b>st for it, because my skin just so happens to be white. Isn't that in and of its<b> elf rac</b>ist against white people? Just because my ancient ancestors were a bunch of pricks doesn't mean I am too. Honestly, it feels like most of<b>  the ra</b>cism I've been seeing lately is against white people rather than by white people. Obviously, there are plen<b> ty of r</b>acist white people, but there's also ple<b> nty of </b>racist Spanish people, and pl<b> enty of</b> racist Asian people, and p<b> lenty o</b<b> >f racis</b>t African people, and so on and so for<b> th. E</b>very \"race\" of people have some membe<b> rs that</b> are racist. That's simply how humans work, so I honestly don't understand how in the modern day some people still feel it's okay to belittle and demea<b> n and</b> entire race of people because some are a bit foul.",

Following Hitler's rise to power in 1933, the Frankfurt School left Germany for Geneva before moving to New York in 1935, where it became affiliated with  the University in Exile of the New School. The New School had founded the University in Exile in 1933, with financial contributions from the Rockefeller Foundation, to be a haven for scholars dismissed from teaching positions by the Italian fascists or <b> Nazi </b>Germany. The New School has followed a tradition of synthesizing leftist American intellectual thought and critical European philosophy, particularly the teachings of Aristotle, Leibniz, Spinoza, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Arendt, Freud, Benjamin, Wittgenstein, Foucault, and Derrida. The Critical Theory of the Frankfurt School holds an especially strong influence on all divisions of the school. As Frankfurt School historian Martin Jay explains, 'And so the International Institute for Social Research [Frankfurt School], as revolutionary and Marxist as it had appeared in Frankfurt in the twenties, came to settle in the center of the capitalist world, New York City.'<b>  Black</b> Terror White Soldiers, p380",

It's an unfortunate truth that people who care about actual equality get screwed over by the extremists, but this to me feels like the KKK endorsing Donald Trump - when you have people on your side who are insane, it makes you want to distance yourself.",

They are the ones that seek to <b> gender </b>studies and gindergarten teachers, skewing the values as there are much more low paid workers. A contsruction worker deserves to be paid more as the job is somewhat dangerous. Instead of asking for money for their cause and promoting<b>  gender</b> studies, they could encourage young women to study more men-dominant professions. That's what vocational colleges here in finland are doing.

Now, I wanted to go into computational linguistics which is a niche, douchey, and in the grand scheme of things not that useful discipline so I guess I wouldn't have had the most room to talk anyways, but with that at least I had planned to focus very hard on computer science aspects and to attain fluency in a couple languages. What value is \"cultural criticism\" to the world in the slightest bit? A degree program to produce people who are professionally adept at criticizing a culture that has produced virtually all of the wonders of the modern <b> age,</b> including the universities where this garbage is taught. Some of these professors ought to be ashamed of themselves, to fill a young person's head with divisive, anti-social, repurposed Marxist claptrap and unleash them upon the world to just break and shit on everything they see, and in the name of \"progress\" no less.",

With women, it's only mass hysteria going on, and really capable and intelligent women become suddntly 12 years <b> old </b>small girls. That is this kind of social issues that women have to face instead of denying it. Personaly, the worse board in a company that I had to deal with was a board only with women : they were<b>  crazy</b> together, didn't listen to any advice, making only the worse and most expensive choices.

Is there no end to the intersectional rabbit hole? \n\nI'm genuinely surprised how such a self-destructive and untenable ideology can persist for so long. It's probably the complete lack of critical thinking coupled with the \"with us or against us\" black/white mentality that's so ingrained in SJW/PC culture. Or in other words, social horseshoe theory in effect. It'll be interesting to see how things evolve in the next 50 years or so, to say the least.",

By using a female term with a male term also forces the masculine context instead of the neutral.\n\nFor example if I walk into a room of people and say; \"hey guys! how is everyone!\" I clearly mean the crowd and not the males exclusively. However if I say; \"hey guys and gals!\" then I am distinctly addressing both genders.\n\nThere are many examples of this in English. Perhaps the most<b>  common</b> is \"mankind\", which tends to imply humanity as a whole, as opposed to \"womankind\" which means women exclusively.\n\nIn this case, though, it is simply a colloquial expression. So no....I meant \"oh man.\"\n\nIf you prefer I can edit it to \"oh boy....\"",

            "commentText": "I continue to be right about everything. Called this last week. Liberal rags like Huffpost, Jezebel and Gawker are going down in flames due to their Tea-Party-esque blogs and articles and \"reporting\"...No one likes them anymore, readership is plummeting, and Huffpost posts a tweet arrogantly asking \"Notice anything about our editors meeting?\" \n\nThey were snidely bringing attention to their all-female staff.Their ALL WHITE staff, that is. Their own fans chewed them up and spit them out, and their arrogant post was so short sighted, they couldn't even predict the backlash from THEIR OWN READERS. They don't even understand or know their own readers!\n\nAnd the few that there are, you'd think Huffpost would be better prepared, after they contributed to and propagated the anti-male/white narrative. Its all so hilarious, if only this \"liberal elite\" establishment wasn't destroying liberalism and dragging it down with them.\n\nOver 50% of white men are exploited and underpaid in America, and none of these rags even cares to acknowledge this, and instead opts to ridicule and shame poor white males in their quest to fill the holes that is their dried up and barely used vaginas.\n\nThey've created a hate machine full of deficient asswipes who want to blame everyone else for their inadequacies, and ignore every aspect of ACTUAL liberalism. The result will be a Trump presidency. It is no longer Americans faults.The egomaniacal self centered liberal elite christened themselves the leaders of the agenda and voices of anyone not a republican...and they failed. \n\nThey failed miserably.Yes...lets look at Huffposts all female editors staff...a bunch of incompetent idiots in desperate need of a man to fix the shit pile they created. HA!",

If it was in engineering or chemistry, then it's justifiable. But these are degrees that don't offer jobs. Also, it doesn't get much better than this.

If anything, us men should be complaining about how all courts side with the women more than the men automatically simply because of <b> gender.</b> So for example, you cannot win in court in a battle for custody over your children to a bi-polar and mentally<b>  handicapped</b<b> > woma</b>n who cheated on you, even if she's physically and / or mentally abusive and lives in a run-down apartment, even though you're a well respected business man in a nice house with no criminal record. All she needs to do to win in court is make a very easy accusation without any proof at all stating how the man did something wrong. Voila, t<b> he wom</b>an automatically wins in court. How is t<b> hat gen</b>der equality?\n\nFeminists complaining about money is just retarded, I personally would trade my money for their legal advantage any day.",

If research, objectivity and context meant as much as they ideally should, feminism would have died long ago. Sensationalism, appeal to emotion, abuse of neoteny and demonizing dissent through misuse of labels is working pretty damn well for them, enough not only to put food on their tables but to sway public opinion, change laws, and even influence mainstream art.\n\nMuch as I hate to admit it, feelings are a valuable currency in human society.

Because it points out to major issues regarding having authority towards editorial decisions. First of all, it might be an indicator of overpowered laziness. Who needs to double check sources if we all agree, am I right? And secondly, they are probably biased and have a pretty narrowed perspective and by that, insight. So... without being harshly judgmental with this meeting rooms full of ladies... what they are doing isn't simply employing all their friends? I mean, <b> nothing </b>\"intellectual\" about it and<b>  nothing</b> wrong, that's fine (not that much, but whatever). I don't know why they congratulate themselves for being in a position of power where they can offer a job to their friends and have a nice time chillin' at work. That can be described by only one word: privilege. HA!",

You can be for equality, but decide to focus on womens inequalities and that's why your a feminist. There's <b> nothing </b>wrong with having a 'specialty' so to speak. Men's Rights Activists are also for equality, but focus more on fixing mens inequalities.\n\nThe fun comes in along with intersectionality. As the \"White Feminist\" part of the video makes plain, they feel that if you don't actively support something, you must be against it. As such, while feminists could stand behind the \"I'm just focusing on these issues, but that doesn't mean I don't consider other issues important\", they lose the ability to do that when intersectionality contends you must think about all problems at all times. It doesn't allow for specialists or niche-fillers.\n\nSo they collapse under their own hypocrisy.",

Following Hitler's rise to power in 1933, the Frankfurt School left Germany for Geneva before moving to New York in 1935, where it became affiliated with  the University in Exile of the New School. The New School had founded the University in Exile in 1933, with financial contributions from the Rockefeller Foundation, to be a haven for scholars dismissed from teaching positions by the Italian fascists or <b> Nazi </b>Germany. The New School has followed a tradition of synthesizing leftist American intellectual thought and critical European philosophy, particularly the teachings of Aristotle, Leibniz, Spinoza, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Arendt, Freud, Benjamin, Wittgenstein, Foucault, and Derrida. The Critical Theory of the Frankfurt School holds an especially strong influence on all divisions of the school.

I just think that experiments in the 60's of connecting human brains to electronics never stopped, but just got hidden away.  You can see that, now, some schools like USC have experiments again where they're connecting people to machines to control robots, or to have computers watch people learn so they can read their minds in the future (and it works).  Can you imagine how useful it would be to connect people directly to tanks and fighter jets?  But this kind of research is scary and would violate natural rights.  So where would that happen?  It would have to be somewhere very secret, where rulers are desperate for food to control their people.  NK might give the military a secret lab sort of like Stanford's NSA lab, or the ones where the Nazis, and the Soviets used to have, where they experiment on human slaves, take apart living humans (which the Japanese also did to the Chinese before). Twin studies were also popular where they leave one unharmed for a scientific control subject.  Then the head of Google, Schmidt, and his right hand man Cohen (who advised both Hillary as Sec. of State. and Ambassador to China, and Condi Rice in the Bush admin., before which he was detained in Iraq as an American spy) dropped in on NK a few years ago with some excuse like they were monitoring how the people are using computers.  Well, how is that, when the NK is supposed to be a hostile, evil empire?  Also, Google is closely associated with NASA and the Air Force.  They share the base Moffet Field in the Presidio and a bunch of key people, also with Singularity.  That whole area has been a haven of military and mind control operations, the United Nations, the CIA, NSA, and Skull and Bones, as far back as it goes, since it was Spanish naval base.  1970 until 2010, I'm sure all this stuff had to happen somewhere, because they're not just going to leave that on the table.",
