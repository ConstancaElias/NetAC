Even China's name in Chinese Zhonghou which is often translated as \"Middle Kingdom\" means a bit more than that: it means the country at the center of the world.  They believe, even the<b>  \"communis</b>t\" that China is still the center of the world.  And China has a police of Hanism, which Mao Zedong was actually against, that believes Han people and culture are the best.  China is putting into that idea into action against other Chine<b> se ethn</b>ic groups, the Uygur being the best example but it can be seen in other groups as well.  China is also HIGHLY, I had to capitali<b> ze, rac</b>ist against Africans instead of being open to them and other historically maligned groups and refugees.  They even have separate Chinese<b>  and Afr</b>ican bathrooms and Chinese only restaurants IN AFRICA, sorry again for capitalizing.  I could go on and on but look it up yourself and see for yourself.  :)\n\nJust wait though, the replies will be full of Chinese 50cent army(a network of Chinese trolls paid by the government of China the equivalent of 50cents for every pro-China post) saying that US or Euro<b> pe is r</b>acist for what it did in the past.  The key word is past unlike China who is doing it today and who denies it even happens when there is overwhelming evidence unlike the US and Europe who acknowledge it.  :)",

Murica saved them big league from the Japanese who had a fusion of modern and guerrilla training. China is like Iran was; personal freedom but no political freedom. As you know the definition of ill gotten gains; the only way China could further effect the wound from the repeated backstabs is too declare war on the U.S./Britain/Canada decimating themselves instantly without full sickle support. \n\nDon't know much about Thailand, Vietnam etc yet and don't hate anyone have a laugh; its funny too hear a Japanese guy talk shit about a Chinese guy & vise versa.

I tell you, I am just so tired of thi<b> s 'RA</b>CE' stuff.  None of us filled out an application before we came here.  We did not choose <b> our r</b>ace, dad and mom, or what language, culture we would be born in.  Why should anyone apologize for t<b> heir </b>race or made to feel ugly and/or unaccepted due to <b> their</b> race.  Things like being loud, rude, obnoxious, mean, and hateful are the things to apologize for but NOT THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN  ( ...you were born the WRONG color)...SAYS WHO??? GOD made <b> us th</b>e race HE wanted us to be (( HE loves variety)).  Why did not get a chance to pick & cho<b> ose o</b>ur RACE.  As long as SINFUL MANKIND is on thi<b> s earth</b>, RACISM  is something we will have to deal with us JESUS return.

Chinese people Never appreciate anything. They travel overseas not to experience new culture or people or places, they travel overseas so that they can take photos and show off to their friends.If you go china, say you r there to see your gf family, they will say chinese culture this chinese culture that, do this , do that but when they come to overseas they do not even want to respect others or even care about other people's cultures.

The policies and social construction of China is far mo<b> re raci</b>st then that of the U.S.\u00a0even though\u00a0the U.S. is extreme in its own racial issues, take this as a learning situation back home to make changes please let people know its not ok to label people as foreign or Chinese each person has their own culture, language and way of life, skin color should not determine how much a person gets paid ect. ect. you just had a name removed life as a non Asian in China is far more traumatizing then what you went through.",

            "commentText": "For me growing up in a poor <b> black </b>area, internalised<b>  racism</b> i<b> s blac</b>k children enacting gangster culture. The media overwhelmingly pain<b> ts bla</b>ck people in negative ways and these children come to internalise these images, and it becomes part of their identity formation. Studi<b> ous bl</b>ack people?? Hardly ever seen, so these kids become disengaged from education and are more interested in being a gangster because to them that is cool. That is expected. Humans are mostly conformist, just look at conformity experiments here on Youtube, you can have people stand up when a bell rings <b> in a doc</b>tors office just because others are seen doing it repeatedly. I KNOW Of this fo<b> rm of r</b>acism  BECAUSE I LIVED THIS. I went to a ma<b> jority</b> black school and was educated in this rebellious lifestyle. The people around me aspired to be cool, they thought they were rebelling against a system that wasn't for them, but hey were only eleven, so I doubt they had a true understanding of what this meant, only that they should be lawless in order to rebel (they sometimes expressed this vocally). Having a competitive personality I was keen to impress my peers. It did not matter what was to be sought after, had the school culture been to strive for high achievement, I would have strived. That was not the culture, so the school was extremely bad, each of us trying to act as cool as possible. Oh you are going to skip class! Oh My God, you are soooo cool! They looked up to me and I was p<b> opular</b>. Black children who wanted to work hard were absolutely ridiculed and bullied, I was certainly not going to be seem in that light! unfavourably! I realised it was a trap when my sister's year left the school and were still hanging out on the street. I wondered where their life would go? Was shocked and felt set-up. It was like smoke and mirrors that lead to no where. So I woke up and completed five years of work in one year to ensure I could pass school and get into college. I went to college and found the joy of learning - I got all A's. I was sad about all the years I COULD HAVE BEEN LEARNING, I am still sad up to this day! I went to university and now, existing in this world, I no longer feel empowered, I did as a rebellious youth, subscribing to that I felt alive! During this time I believed I lived in a post-racist society. Now I work in spaces where I am judged, looked down on etc. Without anyone having even spoken to me yet. It is one of the most draining and depressing experiences! It is the biggest system of oppressio<b> n faci</b>ng black people right now and it is one that has them killing each other or ended up incarce<b> rated.</b> So black people are not free if they internalise a culture that will have them locked up. They are still lynched if they are being killed, even if it is by someone that looks just like them. it is quite a genius system tbh, ruthless and insidious, but of course the most evil thing that exists to keep a people down!  Studying Psychology and understanding how we come to see ourselves and others come to see us, it fascinates me that this is the case. I have no doubt that this system has been designed intentionally, and you only feel the oppression of it when you do not enact it, when you uphold it you feel empowered, probably how white people feel on a day to day basis carrying out their norms. I feel more respected on gym days in a tracksuit than on work days in a suit. I am being unauthentic, not operating in my position of blackn<b> ess. I</b>t is crazy because I used to a<b> ctuall</b>y see black people in a suit and judged them this way, shouting to them that they are a coconut. It is tr<b> uly sa</b>d that black identity has been shaped as ghetto/gangster identity! I hope we can liberate our young people from this system of oppression.\n\nYou simply don't understand the systems of oppr<b> ession</b> facing black people<b> , incl</b>uding in black countries, where it is so unde<b> rdevel</b>oped that black students leave to come and help <b> build u</b>p another nation. \n\nIntelligence is coding for by 100s of genes unlike phenotypes which is controlled by only a few. Intelligence does vary throughout the population but is not determined by skin colour. I have met and worked with smart and less intelligent people from ALL ethnicities. This is a weak argument<b>  for t</b>he state of black people. Scientist have even said there is no s<b> cient</b>ific basis to race because genes vary widely between people. I am sure you have all encountered people that look like you who have different personalities and levels of intelligence. Sometimes you can meet someone who doesn't even look like you and ye<b> t they </b>have more in common with you personality wise...\n\nSome group claim to be so smart but are subscribing to outdated ideologies and helping to oppression other human-beings. The world disgust me, but I don't care about this, I<b>  care a</b>bout fightin<b> g raci</b>sm that affects black and brown people of colour.",

I have been living in China for 5 years, and everyday I take a moment to relax myself before going outside because I need to prepare to endure a barrage of abuse from people laughing directly into my face, trying to walk into me deliberately, and thats on a good day if im not being extorted. Please see through the face game. If you say even something innocuous they take objection to, there will be all hell to pay, but they will come to your country and start forcing demands on you. Wise up. There is a big difference between indiscriminat<b> e racis</b>m and necessary probabilistic generalizations which are usually true.",

I just dont understand. Guys, this immature, childish behaviour is just adding hate on hate, and we don't need that, especially in today's world. We have to work to build each other up, and NOT tear each other down. Just because some Chinese ar<b> e racis</b>t, don't mean the whole group is that. This type of generalisation is a form <b> of raci</b>sm too, FYI. We all have a right to stand up for ourselves, as I'm doing now, as these Chinese students are doing. As long as its peaceful, harmonious and not being mean or rude. I'm not trying to defend the Chinese, or a particular group of people, I mean to say that for all of us on this earth, whether your Chine<b> se, Afri</b><b> can, In</b>dian or other nations/races. The<b> re is r</b>acism everywhere, not just in China or America, and each of our role is to stand up for what we believe in, in a ethically correct way, and disarming the hate, poverty and bad stuff that goes round, not adding fuel to fire. Think about my paragraph, and I hope you will reflect on it in a positive light. Don't spread hate, spread love and acceptance of each other instead!!",

My chinese name is wen bao xing. wen is my family last name and bao means precious and xing means gentle, warm, and kind. And the fact that growing up, american kids would always ask me what my chinese name was right after they would ask me (all the time) what my <b> ethnicity </b>was so id tell them. Right after, they would instantly ridicule my name and proceed to make horrible and<b>  racist</b> \"chinese accents\" to say my name and say ching chang chong. I felt so insulted, hurt, and completely disregarded and discriminated. Like my own culture an<b> d ethni</b>c background is a complete joke to them. It was like MY O<b> WN RA</b>CE <b> AND ETH</b>NIC CULTURE IS A COMPLETE JOKE OF EXISTENCE. LIKE THE BIRTH OF MY<b>  OWN </b>RACE IS A JOKE AND MEANT TO BE ONE FOR EVERY <b> OTHER</b> RACE TO BASH ON AND MAKE FUN OF. My own heritage is one of the oldest civilizations in the world. We paved way for modern day development, technology, trade, and immersion of food and culture.

We all suffered extremely serious<b>  racist</b> abuse behaviour and even physical violence by Chinese people in China: far more serious than anything described in this video. Serious physical assaults, threats, disapproving stares for those of us that had local girlfriends or boyfriends, refused in housing and house shares, ripped off and getting robbed were daily occurrences for us. Local people often refused to sit next to us on public transport, share elevators or gym equipment with us. Foreign females, particularly those of European descent suffered seriou<b> s sexua</b>l assaults. Any students <b> of bla</b>ck origin received the most appalling abuse on a daily basis. Many mainland Chinese people have an extremely and increasingly ultranationalist and abhorrent world view: this video is a serious distraction from this and does not even explore these themes.",

We all suffered extremely serious <b> racist </b>abuse behaviour and even physical violence by Chinese people in China: far more serious than anything described in this video. Serious physical assaults, threats, disapproving stares for those of us that had local girlfriends or boyfriends, refused in housing and house shares, ripped off and getting robbed were daily occurrences for us. Local people often refused to sit next to us on public transport, share elevators or gym equipment with us. Foreign females, particularly those of European descent suffered serious<b>  sexual</b> assaults. Any students o<b> f blac</b>k origin received the most appalling abuse on a daily basis. Many mainland Chinese people have an extremely and increasingly ultranationalist and abhorrent world view: this video is a serious distraction from this and does not even explore these themes.",

Because as far as I know, most foreign students in China are enjoying preferential treatments such as separated but better dorms than the locals, with less roommates, elevators, air conditioners and their own bathrooms while the locals are squeezed in a tiny room with 4-8 other students. Foreign students also have monthly cash subsidies from the government and lower standards to pass exams. Chinese people heard that some westerners would love to have more personal spaces so they respect you by leaving you larger room on crowded public transportations. I guess you may just have misunderstanding about them.",

I think that is what the OP wants to say. \nForeigners are getting preferential treatment, well they are having to pay way much more for that .... and they have no other options.

Firstly About the dorms. We are not allowed to share dorms with Chinese students. We have no choice. We are 'contained' in a foreign students dormitory where we pay considerably more than local students. Cash subsidies are part of government policy. <b> Nothing </b>to do with anything I described. You seem to think that government policy towards foreign student bursary has some relationship with what I describe. I also don't buy the space thing, they are pushing and shoving us more than local people push and shove, yet won't sit next to us. I think you are trying to 'defend Chinese people', I have no words for how moronic your response is. Mainland Chinese people are deeply<b>  racist</b>.

There are many Chinese local students disagree with this separated policies but there are not much things they can do, do you think they have more choices than you?

Some people are even just straight racists and it often upset me too! Sadly this problem is often ignored in the chinese society and I genuinely hope one day, as more chinese people go outside and see the world, we can tolerate diversity more and see that<b>  race</b> doesn't matter!",

They have been burned alive and hung hourly. No Asian ever came out to protest in their favor. Instead the are proud to discard their native names and revert to themselves as kathy and Michelle. While blacks fought and died to get rid of miscegenation laws they still stood on the sidelines and waited until the dust settled to finally have an opportunity to Maryy Dave and chad only because the <b> black </b>civil rights movement prevailed . Furthermore, chocolate people continue to march in the streets protesting unarmed killings of chocolate people, and no where in those protest do you see Asian people helping. Maybe a few lynchings and live burnings will wake these people up. Sadly, I predict they will still shun their history, their names, and purchase blue contacts because they have a deep desire to be, and be with these same people who do these disgusting acts.

The<b>  black</b> people they have seen are from western media: heavily stereotyped roles where you guys are portrayed as thugs and criminals. Also, keep in mind they have a general distrust of outsiders. And don't forget the classist implications of skin color in china- this is a country where people have just begun to get rich and money is the difference between two worlds. The geographic wealth gap is huge, and the poorer people in the countryside have darker skin. Yes, I know it'<b> s racis</b>t, but it doesn't mean Chinese culture and people are inherently bad. It's human nature to keep to ones 'own' group UNLESS they have been taught otherwise. They are coming from a place of ignorance. Give them time, willing activists, and good policy, they will change for the better like the rest of the world did. People feel compassion for those who lack food and money, so why don't they feel the same for those who lack knowledge?",

But, I have been attacked by some chinese, with ALL DEROGATORY comments without offences, e.g. they deny that i am American by ethnics/ dna, eventhough the DNA test shows it. So they keep insisting to the others like to the USA government and also to the AU government etc etc.. with very very derogatory comments like calling me as Phillipino maids, or they insulted me for having multiple plastic surgeries, until I have fairer skin than them. While I never have those procedures to make me more beautiful than the chinese. They also keep attacking me, like I have to obey them, they said if I indeed have that chinese ancestries, then I have to accept any chinese guys as my spouse, even the bad ones, the unwanted ones by them. Also, they to the Japanese, they lied that I am korean, or phillipinos, etc. But behind the Japanese, they mistreat me somekind like a slave, by calling me deserve to be treated bad due to I am Japanese, or American. On the other occassions, they insult me that because I am American in ethnicities/ origins, then they would send false reports to the USA government to reject me and to deny me. So.. very very severe.. without offences.. I admitted that fewer times, I confronted them politely.. ... then they again twisted the things against me. I try to understand that any people able to do those, then they must have issues in their mind/ brain.",

They would almost all only socialize with their own kind and avoid all us American students. I even had an Asian American friend tell me multiple times about how they would talk shit about Americans and white people in Mandarin right next to us. So if the story in this video even actually occurred then we still shouldn't depict Chinese born students as oppressed because they do a lot more disrespectful things then us",

People kept on saying because a particular thing happened in  your race/country/culture, therefore, you are deprived of the rights to forever defend bad things that happen in your life. Come on, a country/culture is composed of individuals with different point of views. Also a government's decision does not represent the decision of everyone in the country. If people think that these students cannot defend themselves because of something that someone else did, that is just mean. Are you gonna stay quiet if someone comes up to your door and destroys the beautiful picture hanging on there that means a lot to you? I wouldn't think so. If this happened to your kids/family/friends, how would you feel?",

We all suffered extremely serious<b>  racist</b> abuse behaviour and even physical violence by Chinese people in China: far more serious than anything described in this video. Serious physical assaults, threats, disapproving stares for those of us that had local girlfriends or boyfriends, refused in housing and house shares, ripped off and getting robbed were daily occurrences for us. Local people often refused to sit next to us on public transport, share elevators or gym equipment with us. Foreign females, particularly those of European descent suffered seriou<b> s sexua</b>l assaults. Any students <b> of bla</b>ck origin received the most appalling abuse on a daily basis. Many mainland Chinese people have an extremely and increasingly ultranationalist and abhorrent world view: this video is a serious distraction from this and does not even explore these themes.",

But western countries try to <b> sell </b>race concept, and want Asian countries to join, then beat them in their game. this is stupid.   there is no solution , as its not severe enough to start a war  in peaceful era.  But ever if there will be one targeting Asians same as against Jews, that will be the very moment to reshape this sick world . as Asian countries moving up to lead the world in many fields including military, having so much population and with entity and a certain level of solidarity , the ending will be quite more optimistic than the Jews' .",

That way is to teach those  naive white people in their \" little world \" how to be polite, and let them realise they are just normal.\n\nChina is a great thousands years civilisation and a current great power. But our civilian seems are still not yet match up our powerful <b> nation.</b>\n\nYou can't change the view of American of Asian stereotypes, than we must be ourself ! Being a Chinese ! we should keep this honour, but not insult it ! So I suggest everybody go to the GYM after school, play less VIDEO GAMES",

Why this biggots target you and make you feel bad. \n\nThis is white way: they always hate the rise of non-white. Why they hate China and chinese because this country are the first economic power in fact. Chinese are hard worker, brave why they Rise and succed. They have strong Minds.\n\nWhites are scary to be a minority because they know how many evil things do around the world. This obsession of losing power this why white supremacist are so confuse, agressiv and try to destroy non white emerging. \n\nDear white be sure you will be a minority. Nature gonna make you pay all evil you do on this earth. You know if you be minority you gonna have to pay the Bill (your evils things). \n\nYou have whites (western whites) and the rest of world that all !",

I went to study in China at Beijing Language and Culture University (now called\u5317\u4eac\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u5b66) in the 90's. Chinese people would try to cheat western students at every opportunity, even national regulations mandated that we had to pay more simply to visit tourist sites. Some of the swimming pools wouldn't let you in unless you were Chinese, or at least Asian. When walking along a street in Wangfujing with a female Chinese classmate, the local vendors angrily asked her \"why she didn't like Chinese people\".

But it doesn't help to be honest the way the Chiniese government has treated its own people and the west. When people hear that China has stolen from companies from around the world and it's hacked in to companies computers and counterfeited may products that reflects on you all. We all have our own way of dealing with<b>  racism</b>. But a lot of Asians ar<b> e racis</b>t too. They talk down to other groups too. But like I said it's this distrust because of the way China had treated others. The United States is bad but China is worse",

If you lived in a <b> communist </b>country, I don't think you would want to risk the safety of your family to say things against the government right? However, those Chinese students made this video because the people around them in college are doing things to them and their culture in a hurtful way. While it is a huge problem to have our info blocked in China, I am sure that is something that people do not want but we cannot do anything about it. However, you can do something and should def so something if someone kept on tearing down your name that represents your country, yourself, your family, and your culture. And in fact, most people do know about 1989 Tienanmen Massacre. Even though I came to the US when I was 14, I learned about that when I was 12.",

Can we also talk about how mad all you Chinese people were when America invited Dalai Lama to meet America? You Chinese treated Tibetan people badly, and you try to justify your own government? Chinese just aren't compatible to Western society! You're lucky that you get to live in America, now stop complaining about America.",

Let's admit, their history with this world is not pleasant yet still.\n\nAlso, places like Korea, Japan and China will flat put tell to your face they don't rent rooms to non Asians respective to one of the countries I mentioned above.\n\nThere would be bars/restaurants/supermarkets that would say no foreigners. Also, the job factor, they will flat out say if you are too dark we will not hire you even though your are qualified for the job. \n\nYup, there is<b>  racism</b> everywhere, in Africa, Asian, America and Europe.",

There are too few Chinese women in the country side, because many of they were aborted by their parents during 1 child policy and those who were born tend to leave home and go to the cities, and they are often very expensive to marry, so the men have no choice but buy women from poor SEA countries. Those girls from Thailand/Indonesia/Vietnam are sold by their parents and traffickers and are basically slaves to the buyers. I studied human trafficking intensely, and I hope you are aware how ugly the human trafficking industry of SEA is, rather than thinking it's something normal. Those poor SEA girls need help. Some are as young as 12, which is pretty sick. They are still children. They deserve basic human decency.",

They are an existential threat against dark people worldwide. Not to mention self loathing and misandrists that promote feminism by bashing their own men. Lets speak truth an Asian<b>  woman</b> is so insecure and feels so worthless she will poke holes in condoms to have a white baby. Dont buy their confucian pacificistic ways they are quietly fueling white supremacy quietly in America and all over the world the saddest part is that their hearts are pure, kind and clean. They actually deep down in their being believe they are worthless mongoloids who can only take over the world with white innovation and creativity but the fact is whites by in large institutionally have been good at only one thing which is stealing pillaging and appropriating and relabeling other peoples work such as africans indigenous peoples etc i say institutionally not individual white people! Anyway stay far away from the vermin and cancer known as asian females their poisoned conditioned minds cannot change and will require generations at least 2 before they become acceptable to dark folks!",

To answer that question why same Chain hotels have different policy on accepting foreigner guests, here are the possibilities:1. The hotel doesn't want to go through the regulation registration works with local police and foreigner affair department. 2. Local security department has special arrangements for them. 3. At the moment for some reason they don't want to work with foreigners. This happens all over the world. Maybe they had bad experiences with foreigners due to difficulties of communication or customs or whatever.  None of these related with <b> racism.</b> The sarcastic thing is, in China most people are complaining about Chinese are too nice to foreigners, and the visa policy is too easy so the amount of disrespectful behaviors and comments, even criminal activities from foreigners are continually increasing. In the future, I hope we will have more strict regulations like the Japanese do.",

Guess what <b> nothing </b>has changed .... only the process got lengthier and complicated. I am not complaining against the rules. As an expat I am happy to abide by them as a part of responsibility.... \nChina is very friendly to foreigners.... kind of right .... they are friendly to fairer skin and unfriendly and to darker skin and THAT is<b>  racist</b>. Many fairer skin westerners school dropouts who have got teaching jobs in schools all over china, while darker skin foreigners native speakers have been rejected from numerous schools even with a legit teaching degree... And there are number of day to day incidents that are just a google search away   [LINK] \nFinally about hotels.... hotel businesses is an extremely professional business.  no place for personal feelings. Hotels and airlines are trained to have these kind of situations and customers, this is a regular part of their business. And even chinese hotels see a lot of rude chinese customers who they really regret to have....\nguess what many chinese only hotels are regularly raided by civil dressed authorities to check on illegal activities including drugs usage and prostitution.... much less than in hotels that foreigners can stay . Finally check online how rude chinese tourists behave in foreign countries.... throwing noodles on air hostesses face .... pooping in the aircraft.... peeing in elevator ... gorging and wasting food in hotels.... the airlines or hotels did they stop giving chinese people service despite their bad experiences and unwillingness ??? they still continue right?? There is no personal feelings in professional businesses as u stated \"they had bad experience with foreigners\" LOLZ I wish someday the foreign airlines/hotels do the same. \nAnd what is a 2003 rule hanging in without any updates? if its not available its not there ... In most cases your imaginations are not facts and logic\n\nSince all your comments are based on people gossips rather than actual facts. this is going to be my last reply ... there is no point expecting healthy arguments with a person who jumps around claiming to be correct without any logic whatsoever.

All I'm talking about just facts, no matter how many references you are citing if it's not relevant it didn't makes you right. 1. What does Number of the experts in the country to do with the increasing numbers of problems that's experts caused? The only relevant data is the increasing number of the population of the experts.  [LINK]  2. Visa. How many foreigners arrived with tourist visa and get student visa and stays in China for a loooooong period of time making money in all kinds of jobs especially English schools even if they aren't native speakers? How easy for them to go to the best universities it is ridiculous. They can do whatever they want without the resident permit and switch visa types inside the county. As I know not so many courtiers allow that in the world.  3.Hotel. Not gonna say much because what you saying is what hotels should be and in reality in most countries that is not what hotels are really like all over the would. 4. 2003 means your data is from 2003. 5. Chinese tourists? I can write an essay about this issue but Maybe just read this.  [LINK]   6. Don't go down to the color topic. Too many  countries got too much to be discussed. China would come the last. Stop projecting. 7.I'm also tired of this argument, but I kinda have to reply you because for you it's just randomly saying whatever you want to say about others without any consequences but for me it's my duty of citizen to speak up for my <b> nation.</b> I'm a Chinese citizen I studied and lived  in counties in Asia, America and Europe and Africa, worked in tourism industry and married a foreigner who lived in China for yrs. I'm wondering how long have you been to China and how much do you know about China and other countries to say China is the most<b>  racist</b> country? I guess not much because you dislike China so much you won't try to understand more about the it.",

                    "commentText": "I have been in China for nearly a decade and I have been studied/worked all over the world including other asian countries, european countries and the US.... and me myself am with a Chinese , and I do have tons of great chinese friends and definitely one size fits all doesnt work. I do deeply love the country and continuously learning about the history and culture and have respect for that and the many chinese people who do truly follow that . So before you know me I would request STOP judging and making assumptions. But I guess you do not know (or not clear or updated with the facts) \nTalking for your own citizen and speak up for <b> nation </b>??? Surely u r doing it pretty well ...<b>  nothing</b> wrong in it . but u missed the whole point (not surprising) is about being biased/unbiased. I stand up for my own country as well but i would'nt blindly try to cover some of the real life issues it has . And THATs what you are doing .... \nI come from a heavy populated country. And my parents didnt travel so much as I do<b> . nothin</b>g u show on the report gives a justification for pooping and peeing in the airplane or throwing hot noodles at an air hostess's face... this is just that SIMPLE: rude behavior and as far as I know the Chinese culture, politeness is said to be a virtue and a character of the wise.... Guess guys forgot their own culture. Also everyone has a first time .... When young people in our country travel usually we are taught to \"adjust\" and \"not do whatever I like\" and i have seen the similar kind of upbringing in other countries as well. Your report says Chinese people in large numbers got exposed to foreign countries recently so they dont know how to behave.... And you complain foreigners in China doing what they want??? For a record never heard an Expat peeing in the aircraft or throwing noodles at an air hostess face in china.... \nswitching visa in the country.... without leaving? where did u get this wonderful information my friend? or is it another of your walk down imagination lane ? those who come with a tourist visa/business visa/family visa and want to change their visa to a period longer than their intended stay HAS to do that EXITING the country and coming back and doing the FULL formality. Many do that by going back and forth hongkong. As per current rules a Z visa is allowed on arrival ONLY if the person has already been hired by a legal company in China and has all necessary documentation required by the Govt to give him a Z visa .... and Z visa is not a Work permit Those who do part time jobs while being on tourist and student visa are doing that ILLEGALLY those who are overstaying and living without a valid visa are ILLEGAL RESIDENTS.... \nAnd lets not dive into the Illegal immigrants in other countries.... So your country is no \"easier\" than other countries about visa. The process is much complicated than in other countries and yet has way lesser benefits for a legal expat.... also a worse quality of life .... that is what the link i sent u before where China ranked 41... dont understand what u wanna prove by giving back the same link focusing only about China.... The numbers and facts DONT change.... China Ranks 41 way behind other asian countries like japan taiwan singapore and this comparison is done based on parameters of expat life - numbers dont change.\nNext the hotel issue , travelling, cycling and hiking through different countries I can confidently say NO what you are saying hotels are the same every where ... no its not .... and a clear evidence . Are the rude chinese tourist effecting the behavior of how other host countries are providing service? Did the hotel where a bunch of rude chinese tourist shouted and nearly beat up the hotel authorities stop chinese tourists or foreign tourist in the future? did the airlines ban rude tourist? did the pyramid sites blocked chinese tourists? no they didnt .... and if China hotels are so sensitive that \"as per your say\" stopped taking foreigners because of an isolated case of foreigner causing some problem \"which you have no proof of they did\" then this is the problem with chinese hotels.... that doesnt happen around the world \nFinally color issue  and other countries have bigger issue. This is again so typical \"blame it on others\" yes others may have done it in the past . But we are living in the current world not in history... just as u said its 2018. and just this year I have travelled 3 more countries including 1 in asia and still there is the color issue .... blaming others with bigger problems doesnt solve problems in your own backyard. Dont know what you are trying to say about \"non native speakers\"??? whereas my point was how chinese schools and parents have this idea that \"white foreigner\" are true native speaking westerners and are selected to teach, wherea<b> s \"Afric</b>an Americans\" who are true native speakers with a teaching degree, also are consider<b> ed \"Afri</b>can\" and not native speakers and refused for the job. THA<b> T IS RA</b>CIST .... but you try to evade that topic and try to misguide\n\nSo in the conclusion 1) you are purposively misguiding and diverting topics 2) or you are confused and dont understand what the intent of the facts and the arguments were\nAs I said in both the cases there is no point talking to a person who is pretending to sleep or purposively misguiding\n\nTo end it : I love it here , I love this country and the rich culture and true history and tradition. Love my girl and my other very close chinese friends. And no I dont hate chinese people but I hate people who initiate this ki<b> nd of r</b>acist, rude and hate filled behavior and incidents Like any country China has also problems and yes these are some of the valid problems ... Redirecting them or <b> acting</b> blind wont change the facts....or fix them. Thats it! I am done",

When you fill a job application, if you're Korean you have no choice but to tick the \"Chinese\" box\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Asian\nI also disliked the Chinese government for propaganda and that they are corrupted.",

If you know Chinese, just look up the conversations between those economists, pop science authors, journalists, lawyers, etc., on Weibo. They are constantly debating about social issues and stupid policys passed by government in China. Whoever can read should investigate for yourself. Don't be brainwashed by some random guy. I have several friends in China just like you, till this day, they still use all the dirty words to describe CCP on We chat, and blame everything on CCP, including more than five genocides committed by the Indonesian people, which were irrelevant to CCP. But I don't blame them. They were actually persecuted by CCP generations ago, so I think it's natural for them to hold grudges. How about you? What happened to your family or you?",

They have their voice, coming from each individual, which you have either ignored or pretend to be <b> blind </b>to. Your buzz word style comments sound like CCP-style propaganda, only with slightly different content. \n\nAs much as I dislike your propaganda style talking, I'd like to believe you are just naive and kind. If so, you probably should try a different approach. No body is going to listen to you if your sound like a douche bag. Show people respect in your wording, and come up with real solutions. The west? You do know that CIA funded the Indonesian military to massacre<b>  ethnic</b> Chinese, right? While the Chinese were killed in mainland, they were also kill overseas, and the west was not helping. It seems there had been genocides against Chinese all over the place. By Dutch, by Japanese, by Indonesians, by their ow<b> n R<b> e</b</b>>d government. No one is able to help you if you don't help yourself. No one is your savior. If you are sincere in helping people, you should educate people that there is no savior, don't worship any leader, stand up to violations against you, don't be pussies. The Chinese culture stress \"harmony\" too much, and they think being a pushover will solve the conflicts. It can't. That's the real problem.",

You have to understand the Eastern culture to know how much Mian Zi matters to them. Many disasters happened because they want to keep a peaceful appearance, pretending everything is fine. It's not because they don't know the facts, but they don't want to acknowledge the facts. Acknowledging the facts means action and risk, so they chicken out. To communicate with them requires great patience and knowledge in psychology. I don't think you can change much, because they would think that you are brainwashed, which often ends with pointless insult toward each other. To be honest, I think history repeats itself all the time, and there's little hope of redemption. All I can do is protect my family/friend/myself, and other people have to do the same for themselves.

Mian Zi on the bright side is self-discipline, on dark side is refusing to acknowledge problems until it's too late. CCP has destroyed a lot of the good part of the culture, but I can see it's recovering. The TV show Bai Jia Jiang Tian has been paying attention to various Chinese philosophies, but this type of show is still not the mainstream.

Doesn't matter how well you speak and write Chinese (better than these students' English), how much tax you pay or how much time and money you have invested in the country, you will never legally become a part of it.\n\nBut apparently I am mistaken because \"China is not an immigration country\" is the recurring argument they use to justify their own systemic exclusion of non-Chinese. Saying \"China is not an immigration country\" is the same as saying \"We don't want non-Chinese\" but apparently it isn't <b> racist </b>because they are not White.\n\nHow many Chinese have immigrated to the West in the last 20 years? A couple millions probably. How many non-Chinese have been given permanent residency (not even citizenship) in China during the same time? Just about<b>  zero</b>.\n\nWhat are they telling us abou<b> t racis</b>m in America again?",

Serious physical assaults, threats, disapproving stares for those of us that had local girlfriends or boyfriends, refused in housing and house shares, ripped off and getting robbed were daily occurrences for us. Local people often refused to sit next to us on public transport, share elevators or gym equipment with us. Foreign females, particularly those of European descent suffered seriou<b> s sexua</b>l assaults. Any students <b> of bla</b>ck origin received the most appalling abuse on a daily basis.

In China, most of the best schools and colleges are public, owned by the government and the most of their costs are also payed by the government so that the people can send their children to get good education easily. Peking University, for example, is one of the best university in China, a student pays less than $600 annually, which is affordable for most Chinese  families. I'm just wondering how much do a Yale student pay for his or her education per year? For people living in countryside as farmers, the Chinese laws let their children enter elementary schools and middle schools for free. Over 90% citizens of China can read and have ability to write, that's a lot of people. The Chinese government may have their own problems, but for education, they're serious. Before you try again, do some research, please.",

Refugees rush to Europe because it is geographical closer for them to reach and European countries are generally more peaceful  place for them to stay.",

I just think it's freaking hilarious when all these closeted racists and NON-Asians express hate toward Asians in the west yet they are all most likely eating our food, using our shit, using stuff made in China and India etc.,  appropriating our Asian cultures, and exploiting Asian elements and pop culture. I should tell most people I come across to stop using our shit from now on in America.

I hate the <b> black </b>cultural appropriation in Asia as well but i am strictly talking about how there is a lot of anti Asian ness in the west aka in the U.S. especially. Asians in the west are different from mainland Asians. 'We', meaning us Asians in the west/America can receive a lot of hate across the board from other minorities and whites indirectly. so don't spout shit you know<b>  nothing</b> about. Yet non Asian people love appropriating ASIAN cultures and using our Asian pop culture. Don't forget, people also love stuffing their fatasses with Asian food. Many NON-Asians who are ignorant in the west are the most hypocritical of all. Learn to comprehend better",

Prior to all that there we<b> re Afric</b>an students studying over there and the Chinese was constantly harassing them and discriminating against them especially if they saw one of them with a Chinese girl.

There was one incident were the Chinese tried to lock the Africans in their dorms and kill them by setting the dorm on fire cause a lie was spread that a Chin<b> ese wo</b>man got raped by a blackman.  All of these incidences led up to the Nanjing protests that spread to other parts  of China and then what became <b> anti-Afr</b>ican protests turned into Human Rights. Look it up .

The only really horrible thing Britain did in Africa was in 1967 when it opposed the Igbo in Biafra.",

One Chinese guy stole my bicycle from my building when he delivered food to a neighbor. My dad caught him riding on a little girl's bike. The fool didn't even take time to paint over my pink bike and remove the tassels from the handlebars. LOL So based on my PERSONAL experiences, I can say that Chinese people are illegals and THIEVES! And since you conclude that blacks are justly treated badly in China than I can conclude these Chinese students weren't treated half as bad as they should be for their people's behavior in America!!!",

Asian countries are very homogenous, so they are surrounded by people who all speak the same language and who all 'look the same'. No thats not a <b> racist </b>joke. I mean that people have generally the same skin tone (usually pale in places like China and South Korea who idolize very pale skin, and more<b>  tan</b> in Southeast Asia who don't seem to care about being pale as much), same dark hair, same dark eye color. And white<b> , blac</b>k, latino, russian, etc people don't really travel to the lesser known places of Asia (the tourist spots are usually the capitals of the country and such) so in those places they are not as exposed to other types of people. Meanwhile in the US and other places of the West like Canada and the UK, it's much more mixed. There are people of all kinds <b> of ra</b>ce. So more people are exposed to different cultures. Asian countries are homogenous which makes it harder for them to experience different cultures, and that where we come in to educate them. But in places in the West like the US, it's inexcusable t<b> hat rac</b>ism is still prevalent because it's so much more mixed here and there are so many people here. You think we'd learn by now to stop being ignorant fucks and start thinking of all of us as one stupid species: humans.",

It doesn't take much to be pleasant to someone. And the fact that there is PLENTY of<b>  racism</b> toward foreigners in Asian countries while they cry over hear when it's against them makes them a hypocrite, not naively innocent creatures who don't know better. Be the change you want to see, Asia. If you want to talk about illegal things going on in your countries by foreigners, stop violating U.S. immigration laws and doing other crimes while over here (like stealing - my bike was stolen by an Asian delivery guy and from what I heard that my dad told me when he reported it to the police, this is not unusual occurrence). The point is, if I grow up in a household of dark haired people, that doesn't give me the right to treat a blond in a bad way because I simply didn't grow up around blonds. Asians travel enough and have enoug<b> h commo</b>n sense to know how to behave without prejudging and yet they don't. Then they send their kids to America (after being raised <b> by raci</b>st Asian parents) and expect to be treated in a way that they do not treat others in their country. Oh WELL...",

They're not innocent naive creatures, and many Asian countries really need to start changing their ideals to fit into the modern world. But they really just aren't as exposed to much racial diversity. And for something you know little about, things can get twisted. All in all, I just wanted to offer another perspective so people can maybe imagine how different the Western culture is from Asian cultures. I think what we need to keep in mind is they have a different history that affects them in different ways and affects the current generation's opinions on the world, and the US also has a very different history that has led us to where we are now. Also, anyone can be <b> racist </b>so we should not accuse an ENTIRE<b>  race</b> for bein<b> g racis</b>t. To be clear, I'm in no way saying any type <b> of raci</b>sm or just any sort of discrimination (whether it be against Asia<b> ns, Afri</b>can Americans, Latinos, blonde people, or even people with glasses) is okay. The main goal is to stop it all. To stop the hate. And to do that we need to learn to understand each other, empathize with each other, and teach each other the different cultures of the world. So when OP blamed Asians for b<b> eing ra</b>cist to foreigners in their country, that's not okay. Not everyo<b> ne is r</b>acist there. And when the people in the video took down those students' names, that wasn't okay. We can'<b> t beat </b>racism wi<b> th more</b> racism.",

They always complain about everything very insincere, you ask a mainlander about tianinmen square massacre try say it didn't happen because they are brainwashed, to many of them flooding the planet, should stay on their side of the firewall that their government built to censor them from the truth, btw China would be peasants in the dirt if it weren't for USA I guess that's why China hates USA because USA is chinas big daddy and Chinese are never thankful as they have no manners, no honor, no tradition, no decency.",

This is not the american system so no, chinese americans dont usually have these characteristics, but many chinese migrants still think like this and export this thought to other parts of the world so you will find it in america. Not all chinese either i met chinese in China who hated their government and hated the terribel chinese system, but they are they monority as it is dangerous to go against the brainwashing in china, you can lose your life, look up social credit system for information on how china controls its people and makes them robot brains",

At the bottom is the largest pool of people and in the middle is tiers of people organized by their role of overseer over the people underneath them. The group defined the top of the pyramid as \"White\" and the bottom of the pyramid as \"<b> Black\"</b> and in between as stages of light to dark. The people in the middle are protectors of the top as they serve in roles of OVERSEERS over the lower classes. This system was known throughout Asia and Mexico as the Caste System, as was heavily religious based as the White was Pure and Closest to God and the<b>  Black</b> was Wicked and cursed. Today it's the same system that serves as a model for all Corporations including \"States\". The thing is White wasn't referring to skin color, that only came about with the invention o<b> f Rac</b>e in the 1800's.",

Repeatedly challenged by scientists, nevertheless these ideas continue to be advanced. Such discussions distract public and scholarly attention from and diminish support for the collective challenge to ensure equal opportunities for all people, regardless o<b> f ethnicit</b>y or phenotypic variation.\n\nEarlier AAA resolutions again<b> st raci</b>sm (1961, 1969, 1971, 1972) have spoken to this concern. The AAA further resolves:\n\nWHEREAS all human beings are members of one species, Homo sapiens, and\n\nWHEREAS, differentiating species into biologically defined \"races\" has proven meaningless and unscientific as a way of explaining variation (whether in intelligence or other traits),\n\nTHEREFORE, the American Anthropological Association urges the academy, our political leaders and our communities to affirm, without distraction by mistaken claims of racially determined intelligence, <b> the com</b>mon stake in assuring equal opportunity, in respecting diversity and in securing a harmonious quality of life for all people.\n\nAmerican Anthropological Association\nStatement<b>  on \"</b>Race\"\n(May 17, 1998)\n\n [LINK] \n\nFrom its inception, this modern concep<b> t of </b>\"race\" was modeled after an ancient theorem of the Great Chain of Being, which posited natural categories on a hierarchy established by God or nature.<b>  Thus</b> \"race\" was a mode of classification linked specifically to peoples in the colonial situation. It subsumed a growing ideology of inequality devised to rationalize European attitudes and treatment of the conquered and enslaved peoples. Proponents of slavery in particular during the 19th centur<b> y use</b>d \"race\" to justify the retention of slavery. The ideology magnified the differences among Europeans, Africans, and Indians, established a rigid hierarchy of socially exclusive categories underscored and bolstered unequal rank and status differences, and provided the rationalization that the inequality was natural or God-given. The different physical traits of African-Americans and Indians became markers or symbols of their status differences.\n\nAs they were constructing US society, leaders among European-Americans fabricated the cultural/behavioral characteristics associated wi<b> th ea</b>ch \"race,\" linking superior traits with Europeans and negative and inferior ones to blacks and Indians. Numerous arbitrary and fictitious beliefs about the different peoples were institutionalized and deeply embedded in American thought.",
