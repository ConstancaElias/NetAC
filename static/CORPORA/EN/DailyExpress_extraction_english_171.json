Many of those running the party in Cornwall today only joined to take it to the far-Left.', '\u201cMany of them are now actively attacking elected Labour councillors like me. I have been told bluntly that they want to get rid of me.\u201d', 'His departure comes after infighting involving the chair of Truro and Falmouth Momentum, who resigned citing \u201clies, scaremongering and slander\u201d.', 'Tory Plymouth MP Johnny Mercer said: \u201cAcross the country the hard-Left are taking over Labour, hounding out moderates.', '\u201cThe hard-left who have infiltrated Labour support massive council tax hikes and disruptive bin strikes \u2013 and working people would always pay the price with higher taxes and worse services.', '\u201cOnly the Conservatives are working to build a stronger, fairer economy, while Labour are only interested in playing politics, not delivering for people.\u201d', 'This May, some 151 councils across England will hold elections, including all 32 London boroughs.",

Why, they even sacked an MP for daring to bring it up in case they lost the m-uslim vote in their Labour controlled areas. What kind of Labour party is that which kowtows to an alien ideology and dare not criticise it even when it is doing abhorrent things?",
