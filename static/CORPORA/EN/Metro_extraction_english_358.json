Third, fourth? You have to go back.\u2019', 'The propaganda was a haunting reminder of the \u2018No Irish, no blacks, no dogs\u2019 signs seen in some B&B windows in the 1960s.', 'Resident David Kirby was shocked when he found the stickers on his front door and said: \u2018I came home to find these stickers plastered over the door to my flats. This is not good.', '\u2018Racist and divisive hatred spread by cowards. It\u2019s all intended to appeal to the closet racists who have been empowered by the rise of Trump in the US and Brexit here.', '\u2018The people responsible are an underground hate group who seeks a whites-only population.', '\u2018They are also dumb as rocks \u2013 second, third and fourth generation immigrants were born in the UK so not sure where they should go back to?', '\u2018This is not free speech \u2013 it\u2019s an incitement of ethnic and racial hatred.\u2019', 'Stickers were also found on lampposts near a school.', 'A woman claimed to have seen stickers which said: \u2018Say no to Muslim rape gangs\u2019, \u2018Beware of anti-white rape gangs\u2019 and \u2018Beware of what is coming.\u2019', 'Police officers and residents removed the stickers after finding them \u2013 but an investigation will be carried out.', 'A Cambridgeshire Police spokeswoman said: \u2018This morning we received reports of offensive stickers in St Audrey Lane, St Ives. An investigation is ongoing.\u2019', 'Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting crime number 35/11775/19.",

They are now going into a multicultural mode, and Jews will be resented because of our leading role.

Of course, the progressive pansies and left wing Pollyannas will always side with anybody other than the indigenous population becaus ethat fits with their insidious and peverted idea of a multicultural utopia where we all hold hands and wait for the signlas from the Minarets to obey.Cultural Marxists exist and are active at all levels of society. If you dont believe me, check out `Common Purpose`, a far left propaganda organisation which `trains` professional people like police officers, councillors, and politiciansd how to enact the new `progressive` politics, which remove democracy and impose a totalitarian rule like that seen in the USSR from 1917 to 1984. You want that?Well just acrry on with your heads in the sand and watch your country, history and cultural hertitagte destoyed by a 7th Century, Stone <b> Age </b>death cult masquerading as a religion.",
