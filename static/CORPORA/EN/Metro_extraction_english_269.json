        "postText": "An American bishop has been told to \u2018look at your own house\u2019 after telling his flock to not support the LGBTQ community during Pride.', 'Bishop Thomas Tobin said the Pride events \u2018encourage activities\u2019 that are contrary to the Catholic faith.', 'The Roman Catholic bishop was immediately condemned after sharing the homophobic \u2018reminder\u2019 to Catholics online.', 'He tweeted: \u2018A reminder that Catholics should not support or attend LGBTQ \u201cPride Month\u201d events held in June.', '\u2018They promote a culture and encourage activities that are contrary to Catholic faith and morals. They are especially harmful for children.\u2019', 'TV presenter Sue Perkins kicked off the backlash, telling the bishop: \u2018Investigate the paedophiles in your ranks who use their power to predate on the innocent.', '\u2018Send your countless riches, stored in vaults and crypts and offshore accounts, to those who starve and live in penury.', '\u2018Then come and tell me how to live my life.\u2019', 'LGBTQ activist Brian Sims said: \u2018I think you meant to say that Catholic priests have promoted a culture and encouraged activities that are contrary to Catholic faith and morals.', '\u2018One that is especially harmful to minors.\u2019', 'He added: \u2018There\u2019s not one ounce of authenticity of integrity here. Attacking families, attacking people fighting for their rights, attacking people celebrating their community, all the while molesting thousands of kids with self-righteous impunity.\u2019', 'The current bishop of Providence in Rhode Island, Tobin, 71, calls himself a Pittsburgh \u2018native\u2019 and is \u2018proudly pro-life\u2019.', 'He was Pittsburgh\u2019s auciliary bishop from 2992 to 2996 \u2013 a period which has since been rocked by allegations of child sexual abuse.', 'Tobin reportedly said he was \u2018aware\u2019 of the sex abuse incidents but was \u2018not primarily responsible for clergy issues\u2019.', 'Joe Lazzerini, the president of Rhode Island Pride said he was \u2018honestly flabbergasted\u2019 after reading the tweet, the Boston Globe reports.', 'He said: \u2018He is like the Donald Trump of the Catholic Church, he goes on Twitter and spews out hate.\u2019', 'Shocking moment journalist is diagnosed with breast cancer during live, on-air mammogram', 'Around 350 koalas feared burned to death in Australian bushfires', 'Mother frantically stabbed pit bull as it mauled her son, 4, to death', 'He said Tobin\u2019s claim that the LGBTQ community is harmful to children was especially offensive \u2018considering the Catholic Church\u2019s history of covering up clergy sexual abuse of children\u2019.', 'Despite the tweet, Lazzerini said Tobin was still welcome to attend the Pride rally.', 'He added: \u2018There\u2019s so much hate in this world, and Pride is all about love.\u2019",
