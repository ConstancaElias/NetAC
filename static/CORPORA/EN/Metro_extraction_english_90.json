        "postText": "A few days ago, BBC DJ Annie Mac\u2019s played rapper Dave\u2019s new single titled Black. The song is about Black empowerment and aims to remind Black people of our strength and who we are.', 'Though the song has generally received a good response, some people weren\u2019t pleased, with one Twitter user even going as far as calling the song racist.', 'Mac posted on Twitter herself, stating her frustration and adding: \u2018Let me get this straight, if you are genuinely offended by a man talking about the colour of his skin and how it has shaped his identity\u2026\u2019', 'The listeners offering negative comments seemed to be too focused on the title of the song without properly considering the lyrics, such as: \u2018Black is beautiful, Black is excellent, Black is pain, Black is joy, Black is evident.\u2019', 'These are words that champion Black excellence \u2013 they don\u2019t make Black people out to be \u2018better\u2019 than anyone else.', 'Nowhere in the song does Dave mention or insult white people, suggesting that people who claim it\u2019s \u2018racist\u2019 are trying to find an issue with this song that doesn\u2019t exist.', 'If you are white and this song offends you, you have to ask yourself why.', 'Being pro-Black isn\u2019t about Black people thinking we\u2019re superior, it\u2019s a reminder to ourselves that we are equal.', 'As a Black Brit, I have no desire to see myself as above another race \u2013 rather, I just want Black people to be seen as human.', 'My identity is something I\u2019ve wrestled with and that many others continue to wrestle with. We live in a time where we\u2019ve experienced the Windrush generation being deported. I struggle with being from Britain and also originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo. It continuously feels like I\u2019m not good enough to be from either.', 'We live in a society which undermines Blackness and tells Black people that we aren\u2019t worthy. Whiteness is the standard that Black people have to live up to on a daily basis.', 'If the people critiquing Dave\u2019s song actually listened to the lyrics they\u2019d know this isn\u2019t a song about separation, but a song about equality.', 'For instance, European hairstyles are promoted as the \u2018ideal\u2019 standard of beauty and as a Black woman, my hair is constantly judged by this standard.', 'Black women internalise this so we can\u2019t help but subconsciously compare then feel like we don\u2019t match up.', 'This song is a reminder that we are worthy. If you think being pro-Black means being anti-white, you\u2019re probably underestimating the racism that Black people face.', 'In an interview with NME, Mac said: \u2018People are scared of the word black\u2019. I agree with her. Though I think Britain is fairly tolerant compared to other counties, we definitely have an issue when speaking about race and racism.', 'Often when people of colour speak about race, we\u2019re seen as separating ourselves from white people but we are usually highlighting the inequality we face.', 'This is often why people of colour do not speak to white people about race because they can be defensive and, I\u2019ve noticed, unwilling to listen to our experiences.', 'I think white people can be scared of speaking about race too. White fragility is the term used to describe the discomfort or awkwardness some white people feel when speaking about this issue \u2013 many aren\u2019t sure how to approach it.', 'If the people critiquing Dave\u2019s song actually listened to the lyrics they\u2019d know this isn\u2019t a song about separation, but a song about equality.', 'Instead of running away from conversations about race, it\u2019s important that we have these conversations head on and tackle false narratives.",

Can i as a man understand what that<b>  woman</b> is going through. Listen to  the lyrics, if you sincerely disagree then we definitely do have s problem. Its also to help young dissolutioned kids about hope and understanding the culture. The lyrics touched on so many issues that I and millions of others understand, do we all agree, its subjective. Annie Mac should be given credit for playing it. Most of those criticising sound like Tom Robinson.",
