If men were truly oppressed in the west like women are in the East, men would be victims of honor killing, domestic violence and be totally under women's control, by the law. By making the false claim that men are oppressed in the first world, you are making light of the real <b> sexism </b>women face in the third world. It should be obvious to you that men have committed way more evil towards women than women have committed towards men. And they continue to do so as of late 2018. And men on YouTube have the audacity to write disrespectful comments towards women.",
