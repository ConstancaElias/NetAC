        "postText": "A transgender teenager has triumphed in a bodybuilding competition just years after beating a dangerous eating disorder.', 'Alex Tilinca, 18, hit rock bottom in 2016, after developing an eating disorder that saw him consume only one meal every 24 hours and weigh himself up to four times a day.', 'But the Long Islander turned his life around and competed against cisgender bodybuilders at the Victor Martinez\u2019s Legends Bodybuilding Competition in New York on August 24.', 'After clinching first place in \u2018Teen Classic Physique\u2019 and second place in \u2018Novice Classic Physique\u2019 and \u2018Junior Classic Physique\u2019, he wants to use his success to show the world that trans people \u2018are not victims\u2019 and can do anything they set their minds to.', 'Growing up, Alex said he knew something was \u2018really wrong deep down\u2019.', 'He told Metro.co.uk: \u2018I didn\u2019t really understand how I felt but I just didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with being a female.', '\u2018I felt really uncomfortable with the fact that people saw me as a female.', '\u2018It was like living third party to myself. I was just going with the flow because I had to, not because I wanted to. I felt really wrong, deep down.\u2019', 'It was only when Alex \u2013 who now has more than 15,000 Instagram followers \u2013 watched videos about gender dysphoria on YouTube that he finally put a name to the \u2018wrong\u2019.', 'After coming out to his mum at age 11, he was met with love and understanding and began to transition at age 12.', 'But two years later, he became angry and painfully envious of those who were born male around him.', 'After losing the weight that doctors had recommended to ensure minimal scarring for his top surgery, the teenager became consumed by the idea that he had to lose as much weight as possible to look masculine.', 'He became \u2018terrified\u2019 to eat and would sometimes only consume 500 calories a day.', 'Soon enough, he weighed just 100 pounds and was going to bed every night hating himself.', 'He said: \u2018I had dysphoria, so I saw myself as hugely feminine, even though people around me were like \u201cYou\u2019re really skinny, you might want to put some weight on\u201d.', '\u2018I felt very trapped. I felt very helpless, like no matter what I did, it wouldn\u2019t be enough. I always felt like I needed to overcompensate for the fact I was trans.\u2019', 'There are a limited pool of studies on the relationship between transgender people and eating disorders, but it has been reported that they experience these issues at rates significantly higher than any other group.', 'A 2015 study looked at 289,024 students from 223 US universities participating in the American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment II.', 'Researchers found that transgender college students were more than four times more likely than cisgender females to report an eating disorder diagnosis such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia, and two times more likely to report eating disorder symptoms such as purging.', 'A Massachusetts Youth Health Survey in 2013 also claimed that transgender youth had disproportionately self-reported unsafe weight management behaviors and nonprescription steroid use, compared with cisgender youth.', 'In summer 2016, Alex set his mind to beating his troubles and began going to the gym to get fit.', 'His new interest in fitness was pushed further by watching bodybuilding videos online, and soon enough, he had set his mind on becoming a bodybuilder himself.', 'Three years after beginning his journey back to health, Alex has now transformed his body and continues to take his physique to the next level by training at the Bev Francis Powerhouse Gym.', 'He said: \u2018I felt really uncomfortable in the early days of the gym. But that drove me. I was like, \u201cYou know what, screw you guys. I feel really stupid right now, but I\u2019m gonna come back in a year and I\u2019m gonna show you.\u201d', 'The bodybuilder says that, as a trans man, he has found the most acceptance in the bodybuilding world.', 'He said: \u2018You\u2019ve got to be open-minded in bodybuilding. You don\u2019t look normal, you don\u2019t have a normal life, so most bodybuilders are very accepting, because we\u2019re all working on our bodies. They understand where I\u2019m coming from.', '\u2018They understand that I wasn\u2019t happy with my body and how the world saw me, and I just wanted to become who I was.', '\u2018I feel the most support from the bodybuilding world. Honestly, it\u2019s an amazing community.\u2019', 'After his success in the amateur competition, he plans to take three to four years off to build muscle and ultimately aims to become the first transgender male to win the Mr Olympia title.', 'Alex said: \u2018If a transgender male is able to compete against men who are born men, it\u2019s inspiring for everyone, not just transgender people. It shows there\u2019s no excuse.\u2019', '\u2018I want to show that we\u2019re not victims. People always kind of live under the assumption that we need their help and bodybuilding is like a physical embodiment of mental willpower and strength to me.\u2019', 'He added: \u2018Taking part in the competition felt amazing. People were cheering for me and taking videos. It made me feel that my hard work was recognised.', '\u2018A rush of excitement came over me. It felt like the world was telling me that I\u2019m on the right track.\u2019",

                    "commentText": "Becky Samuel over the past 10 months I've completely changed my body shape going from 25 stone to 16, losing a load of body <b> fat </b>as well as gaining an average muscle mass/shape since I paid to see a specialist about low testosterone which was misdiagnosed as depression and anxiety as it is for most men over 35. I've been on test therapy since then and within 2 weeks was off my antidepressants. I'm on a very low dose compared to what someone transitioning will be plus he can just buy blackmarket stuff and even if he's tested it's just put down to transitioning and maintaining a male lifestyle. Yes it takes a lot of training and discipline to get into bodybuilding but it's a hell of a lot easier if you can openly take steroids",

Guarantee every other bodybuilder on those stages with the trans guy would have been juicing but he can get away with it because of the hormone replacement and just pass it off as his hormone therapy. Every single bodybuilder on the planet takes steroids because your body physically can't get to that size naturally.",
