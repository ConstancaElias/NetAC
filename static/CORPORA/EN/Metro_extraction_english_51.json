        "postText": "According to the New York Times, high powered men are avoiding working with young women because post #MeToo, they\u2019re scared.', 'As a feminist, my initial instinct is we should solve this by putting all the rich white men on some kind of an island, like a leper colony for sexism. And according to the reaction online to the NYT article, I\u2019m not alone. But here\u2019s the thing: I am never going to get my leper colony.', 'It might be satisfying to joke about cancelling all white men and how all men are trash, but it doesn\u2019t achieve anything.', 'Rightly or wrongly (it\u2019s the latter) men are frightened of being accused of inappropriate behaviour by women. And while people like me can shout \u2018behave appropriately in the work place and everything will be fine\u2019 until we\u2019re blue in the face, it\u2019s not getting us anywhere.', 'When it came out that Mike Pence never spends time alone with any woman who isn\u2019t his wife, we all rolled on the floor laughing. Post #MeToo, how many men are secretly following the same rules?', 'According to the New York Times, women are being passed over by senior men for formal or informal mentoring because those men are worried about what might happen. Men no longer understand the rules of the game, so they\u2019ve decided not to play. It\u2019s almost like senior men have said that if they\u2019re not allowed to sleep with \u2013 or at least flirt with \u2013 junior women, they don\u2019t want to be involved.', 'The victims of this resolution will be (of course) be women.', 'We know that networking and mentoring are huge parts of making professional progress. If men are afraid to be alone with young women it means that they miss out on drinks, dinners, business trips and meetings.', 'To be fair to these men, the rules do seem to have changed \u2013 fast.', 'It is easy to tell men not to assault women \u2013 easy and vital. What is much harder to convey is the way in which some men make some women feel uncomfortable.', 'Lots of us have had a boss whose gaze lingers too long, who looks down at your chest while you\u2019re talking or makes \u2018flattering\u2019 comments. The kind of boss who tells you that your boyfriend is a \u2018lucky guy\u2019 and brushes his hands over your waist while passing you in a corridor.', 'That\u2019s the stuff that is confusing, the grey area. It\u2019s not assault. It\u2019s not evil. And for some women it would be totally harmless and fine. But for others it\u2019s intimidating, upsetting and uncomfortable.', 'I\u2019ve seen dozens of women on Twitter today saying that men who don\u2019t want to mentor young women because they\u2019re nervous about #MeToo shouldn\u2019t be in the workplace. And I understand that frustration and anger, truly I do. But these men are not going anywhere. They are the bosses. The shareholders. The CFOs. They will not be shifted.', 'We cannot \u2018cancel\u2019 these men, so instead we need to create better working practices.', 'When you put a load of adults in an office there will be shagging, because that\u2019s what humans do. But for instance some US based companies now have a policy where employees of any grade who wish to date need to make a confidential declaration to HR that neither party feels coerced.', 'The internet is teeming with brilliant examples of how consent works \u2013 look at the tea analogy, or The Rock test (if you wouldn\u2019t do it to The Rock, don\u2019t do it to someone you work with.) But the kind of men who are mentors at huge finance companies don\u2019t read #LongReads about consent metaphors.', 'Perhaps it\u2019s naive, but I can\u2019t help thinking that an actual half day training session for senior men about what is and isn\u2019t appropriate, where they are exposed to things like The Rock test, might help clear this problem up.', 'There are those who would argue that men are not confused or scared, they\u2019re just unwilling to mentor women who they can\u2019t fuck or at least objectify. And to that I said, let\u2019s call their bluff.', 'Men are allegedly confused about where the line is, so let\u2019s clarify.', 'If we strip away any confusion about appropriate behaviour, then men can\u2019t use the \u2018I don\u2019t know what I am and am not allowed to do\u2019 excuse anymore.', 'It\u2019s not a sexy answer to the problem, I realise that.', 'Expecting women and companies to teach the finer details of consent to powerful men feels like an unfair burden.', 'These people are educated, rich and powerful. They should already know that \u2018I like your jumper\u2019 is a fine comment, and \u2018I like the way that jumper fits your body\u2019 is not. But if we want to make progress, I can\u2019t help thinking that we\u2019re going to have to do some work.', 'Women have always been expected to do things nicely, to create change through speaking softly and massaging male egos. Is that fair? No. Is it right? Absolutely not. But is it regrettably still the best way to get things done? I\u2019m afraid so.', 'I hope our generation\u2019s daughters won\u2019t need to ask nicely or smile sweetly. We shouldn\u2019t have to. It\u2019s not fair. But it\u2019s an investment in our future.",

Now, I am not saying all metoo charges are unfounded at all, but we have come to the point that apparently some men avoid one on one interaction with women just to get ahead of these things.And then I think to myself, if I were working in some high-up well-paid position and I could lose all that, because I could piss off <b> a woma</b>n and she hits me with a #metoo charge out of spite for it, I'd probably wouldn't mentor women either.And I am sure there are there are rich CEO's who prey on these young women, 100%. As well as I am sure that there are men who had their careers de-railed, their personal lives destroyed by unfound charges.",

I think it's the women who have taken advantage of this \"Metoo\" issue and used it to levy false accusations against ANY man they want to see punished. Feminism has weaponized women with the ability to accuse ANY man with harrasment.....and she is unquestionably believed while the man is guilty in the court of public opinion. Even after the truth sets him free....his life is ruined...and the women faces no recourse for lying. THAT\"S the real problem.",
