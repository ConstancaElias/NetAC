        "postText": "A young teenage girl was allegedly victim to a hate crime which saw older white girls call her the \u2018n-word\u2019 and rip off her acrylic nails at a funfair.', 'The girl, age 13, was in a group of black and dual heritage girls when she was followed and attacked in Bristol on April 13.', 'Police are now investigating and appealing for witnesses to come forward after the girl\u2019s mother, Lindsay Dunn, said her daughter suffered serious injuries.', 'The altercation, which happened at travelling theme park Funderworld, allegedly began when Lindsay\u2019s daughter and friends were singing along to music on one of the attraction\u2019s rides.', 'Lindsay claimed a group of older white girls told them to stop singing.', 'She said: \u2018When they got off the ride, this group followed them off and began calling them the n-word, and giving them racist abuse.', '\u2018The initial part of this incident was racially motivated, and that rings alarm bells with me.', '\u2018My daughter and her friends were upset and angry at this and argued back, and then the group of older girls jumped them, and started attacking them.\u2019', 'She added: \u2018My daughter suffered serious injuries \u2013 basically she was wearing acrylic nails and they were all ripped off in the attack. She was left bleeding badly.\u2019', 'It is believed bystanders intervened and called security, before Lindsay\u2019s daughter was taken to the first aid room, when parents and police were called.', 'Lindsay claimed the aggressors were led off the premises before police arrived.', 'She added: \u2018They didn\u2019t take their names when they\u2019ve witnessed a child bleeding and injured, so they knew it was serious\u2026', '\u2018And my daughter\u2019s friends were also just chucked out onto the road without any concern for their welfare.', '\u2018They were all shaking and distraught, but it was just \u201cget them off-site, brush it under the carpet\u201d.', '\u2018When I went to talk to the Funderworld people, I was offered a complimentary ticket.\u2019', 'A spokesperson for Funderworld said they were aware of the incident but said the alleged aggressors were a mixed group of \u2018BME and white people\u2019.', 'The spokesperson said: \u2018There was an altercation between two groups of young people which the security staff were called to attend.', '\u2018To de-escalate the situation and maintain calm, the two parties were escorted to separate exit points.', '\u2018The incident between the two groups appears likely to have been an altercation rather than a race issue, as the alleged assailants were, in fact, a mixed group who comprised of both BME and white people.\u2019', 'Bristol\u2019s Lord Mayor Cleo Lake said she takes the matter extremely seriously and has requested an investigation.', 'She said: \u2018I deplore any type of racism, bullying or violence. Fairs should be fun places where young people feel safe and should incidents arise we should have confidence that the fair managers and their security address the matter appropriately with urgency.\u2019', 'Avon and Somerset Constabulary have appealed for witnesses to come forward following the incident involving the two girl groups, which saw police called to the scene at 8pm.', 'The spokesperson said: \u2018The incident is being treated as a potential race hate crime. Police enquiries into the incident are continuing.', '\u2018Anyone who saw the incident and has information is asked to contact us quoting 5219080812.\u2019",
