        "postText": "The new leader of the National Union of Students (NUS) has pledged to fight racism on campus and \u2018extortionate\u2019 tuition fees during her presidency.', 'Zamzam Ibrahim, 24, called for a national strike for free education, more maintenance grants for poorer students and the return of a post-study visa before winning the election on April 11.', 'The former president of the Salford University students\u2019 union said in her election statement: \u2018Our national union and our education sector are facing some of the biggest challenges it has had to confront in living memory and is in dire need of transformation.', '\u2018Universities across the UK are facing bankruptcy, college students are unable to afford their journeys to class and racism is running rampant on our campuses.', '\u2018There has never been a greater need to rebuild our national union as the fighting, unwavering force that is primed to brave the challenges that lie ahead.\u2019', 'She continued: \u2018There has been a massive rise in racism, xenophobia, sexism on our campuses and an alarming increase in deportations.', '\u2018Our government is responsible for much of this hate. With the hostile environment and far-right rhetoric from MPs, we must campaign for a fairer world \u2013 on and off campuses.\u2019', 'Ms Ibrahim will become the union\u2019s third female Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic president in a row.', 'She previously sparked controversy in 2017, when historic tweets sent at the age of 16 showed her joking about \u2018oppressing white people\u2019 if she was a leader.', 'Using the hashtag #ifIwasPresident, Ms Ibrahim wrote: \u2018I\u2019d oppress white people just to give them a taste of what they put us through! #LMFAO.\u2019', 'In another message she responded to a question on AskFM about what book everyone should read with: \u2018The Quaraan. We would have an Islamic takeover!\u2019', 'While when asked about the possibility of friendship between a man and a woman, she replied: \u2018I\u2019ve had this debate with many friends! Maybe in some cases but Islamically it\u2019s incorrect for girls to be friends with a guy anyway!', '\u2018So I\u2019m gonna say NO not the kind of friendship they can have with the same gender there is always boundaries.\u2019', 'After the tweets came to light Ms Ibrahim wrote in the Independent that they were the \u2018adolescent comments of a young girl\u2019 and that they did not reflect her views as an adult.', 'She said: \u2018There\u2019s no doubt this collection of social media posts was supposed to make me seem like a fanatical Muslim and a threat to British society.', '\u2018I find it strange that I even have to clarify this, but for the avoidance of doubt I will [again]: the comments clearly do not reflect my views today.\u2019",

Yes they do organise social events involving drinking but they do so much more.",

I wish her well in her new position and hope she learns more about the world and what it is to be open minded and critical about her own subjective views as much as anyone elses. At times we actively search for oppression where there is actually discussion. It is important to be balanced and fair rather than engage in a selective agenda, particular when you are representing a whole community of people rather than the few.",
