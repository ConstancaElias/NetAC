The Home Affairs Select Committee said that this failure had allowed a 'safe space' within the party for those with 'vile attitudes' towards Jewish people.. .

What exactly is the Labour party being accused of?\n\nIm not an atheist but criticism of any religion or cultural practice should be welcomed. No exceptions. And <b> racism </b>exists - of course it does. Humans would find any reason to hate one another, projecting all of their fears and insecurities because its less hassle than having to overcome them. To be completely unbiased, be good to see a report on hate crimes against Muslims, women, homosexuals...because discrimination doesnt just stop at the Jews!\n\nNonetheless, there's some definite anti-jew comments here on YouTube. Other than the fact that a lot of business owners and successful decision makers across different industries are Jewish, what else have you got against the Jews?\n\nOh and FYI, this \"...Jews killed Jesus\" stuff. Jesus considered himself a Jew. He loved the Jewish people. He titled himself \"...King of the Jews\", mate. Read your bible.",

You are not a descendant of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. I'm sorry that bad things are happening to you. But you have no ancestral tie to the Land of Israel since the bible doesn't identify you as the Children of Israel (Jacob).

It's ironic how the Holocaust gets shoved down our throats but you'll never hear about the HOLODOMORS, three of them, and who was behind the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. They starved, murdered and tortured far more white Christians then the inflated six million in the Holocaust. In the HOLODOMORS alone there were at least 15 to 20 million innocent people murdered by the most heinous ways imaginable and that doesn't include the millions that were killed in the revolution. The so called main stream media will never report the truth. Why do you think they're cracking down on YouTube and their so called fake news?

Also if they acquired it through talent fine but why not open them up to the same criticism that other white elites get.. This needs to be openly discussed and maybe tax or something to correct it. Maybe that will help people to understand.",

Most importantly through ownership and control of banking and finance.  Not to mention the corrupting of governmental and political officials.      Look at the last names of the people who own/control the major corporations, Wall Street, political parties, governmental advisors  etc.  In short, he who has the gold rules.  I suspect you're faking ignorance about all of this however.",

They may be the smartest <b> race </b>on Earth, but their narcissism, their disgusting behavior, their<b>  racist</b> attitudes of wanting a Jewis<b> h natio</b>n, yet the same time, attacking Europeans for wanting a country for their own, and they support mass immigration of third worlders and far left wing politics. They desire that the<b> ir ra</b>ce is never attacked or criticized, but they are more happy to attack other races. They act badly because of their genes. \n\n\n\nDisgusting people. Don't forget how many Jews were behind communism, and don't forget that their ideas led to the death of 100 million people, and they think you should be put into jail for criticizing them for this.",

            "commentText": "When anyone talks about antisemitism rising there are some thoughts which must be considered and also some education, some knowledge is requisite. 1st who says antisemitism is on the rise, who is antisemitic and why. I need here say that I have spent many years and have done exhaustive study on the matter. Also I have gone through a number of phases, or some evolution on the subject. Being a 58 year <b> old </b>white Christian man who was raised in the Buckle of the Bible Belt in SW Georgia I used to listen to pro-zionist preachers, precurssors to today's John Hagees, although Hagee was around when I was a young man as well who taught that Jews were God's \" Chosen People\". There were also pro-Zionists politicians, precurssors to John Mc Cain. From buying into these being God's chosen, and thinking that they were damned near immaculate I got so disgusted that I went to the other extreme, i.e., I became a Christian Identist, who not only believed that people of European descent were the \" Lost Tribes of Israel\" but that Jews, all Jews, were the literal, flesh and blood children of the devil through Satan's seduction of Eve. These iare the conclusions that I've arrived at, rightly or wrongly; I no longer believe Jews, at least 95% of them, are the children of the devil. Even more, I don't believe the same 95% are even evil. On the other hand, I don't think they are any more chosen of God than any other people.( I must confess that I have come to question many of the Christian beliefs I once had, but I still believe in the love of Jesus Christ). I do know this from much study, including Jewish scholars like Henry Mackow and Israel Shahak, that the primary cause of antisemitism is caused by zionists( not all Jews are zionists and, surprisingly, perhaps, not all zionists are Jews). Before the beginning of WWII most Jews were against zionism. Many Jews, even in Germany, had assimilated and 75% of the time when a pracicing Jew married someone of another faith the children were raised in the other person's faith. What few people know, or will even bother trying to learn is that antisemotism is necessary to zionists, Jew or otherwise. How many people know that there were numerous opportunities to protect or rescue Jews from the horrors of the Holocaust? For example at one point the<b>  Nazi</b> government was willing to allow hundreds of thousands of Jews to leave occupied Europe, but FDR and Churchill ( whose mother, Jenny Jerome, was an American Jew) at the behest of their zionists masters like Baruch and Chaim Wiseman nixed the opportunity, only so the world's Jews would feel the need of a Jewish homeland. When the Jews moved into Palestine in 1948 immediately they went after more territory than the Balfour Declaration had outlined (Balfour and his cronies had no legal right to give away a foot of Palestine to stsrt with) and committed atrocities like those in Jordan at Dair Yadin where they slaughtered an entire village of men, women and children. Then again the Jews drove 700,000 Palestines from homes, farms and orchards they had lived in for 2,000.  All these things were done, not by your Jewish family dentist or the judge who hears you in traffic court, but by zionist, Talmudic, Kabbalist Jews, like the Rothschilds, Warburgs, the Jacob Schiffs, etc.who only want one thing, i.e., complete control of the world. Already they control all of the world, except for a few Islamic states, like Iran, who the zionist hitman, my so beloved America, has assigned to go the way of Iraq. They've gained control of the world through controlling the economies of the world( like the Federal Reserve, not a government institution, but a privately-owned Rothschild bank) with all this money they've bought all media and all politicians( save for a few who had nuts to stand up to them, like JFK, RFK their father, Joseph, and Trafficant, what happened to these?). While 95% of Jews are not in on this what is conspicuous is that so, so very, very seldomly do you hear an everyday Jew criticize these satanists. Jews are the most intelligent people in the world, so they know all is not right. At the same time since the Talmud contains 10-12 volumes of books, so it's very doubtful that 5% of Jews know of the satanism in this, the most evil book, with the Kabbala, ever composed. So, yes, there is antisemitism. Yes it's wrong to victimize the average Jew. However, Jews should also be sensitive and perceptive enough to understand that when people see themselves soon to become slaves in a Zionist Utopia ( for the Zionists) they become very angry and strike out. True, they strike out at innocent Jews, but then if Jews don't want to be victims of anti semites then THEY MUST RISE AND ATTACK THE VERY DEVILS who cause them to be victims.",

We were playing football with the boys until they tried to pinch the ball and we had to forcibly take it back. The next thing we knew, a police car arrived at the playing field. The boys ran over to it and pointed at us. The police came over and said there had been a report that a Jewish boy had been slashed with a knife!! One of the boys held up his hand to the copper which had a large cut that was maybe a week <b> old </b>and well on the way to healing in his palm. The police took one look at it and got back in their car and left. I have had 2 other experiences involving Jewish people and neither of them were as laughable or dishonourable as that but they were both regrettable and very telling imo to the nature of these people.",

Yes, Jews are people too and so there are some of them that do bad things, and yes, some of those jews (people) that do bad things have a lot of power and have a huge impact. These things happen.

Yet today, especially on the Left there must be something, someone to blame for these feelings the Brits know are wrong. Not fair play in themselves etc.. So you know who they blame.

Well it has <b> nothing </b>to do with that and more to do with what Jews have been unapologetically doing in other people's countries for thousands of years. The Jews have built for themselves a poor reputation as a people. Now that doesn't mean every individual Jew is a problem.<b>  Nothing</b> is ever absolute. However, to deny the Jewish Problem is as bad as denying the flaws of capitalism, denying tha<b> t racis</b>m exists, or denying that Muslim rape culture exists. Problems are never solved by ignoring them.",

Of course this trivia never makes it into the controlled history books.who control's the history books?.WHO EDITS the info?.never a word about the balfour declaration unless its a one sided conversation.or the Versailles treaty over a 100 jews involved in that creation why so many? Murdered germans samething happened in nearly every country they entered to save the germans and others of those nations from the <b> communist </b>jews who's method of torture and murder. Would make most of you throw up.the<b>  re<b> d</b</b>> menace and the history told today is rewritten down to 20million dead.when the real figures used to be between 80 and 140 million..100million were christians..real research about 911 and the country's invaded by jewmerika since then will find that 80 to 90percent of christians are being murdered by a misconception on a war on terrorism.people you're being deceived by this synagogue of satan...here is some help research this stuff....dr.Tony Martin...hellstorm....dark secrets of the talmud...europa the last battle...Robert welch if you want it straight....the greatest story never told....coudenhove kalergi plan.....Morganthall plan..which if you do some serious research about the plan against Germany and its people started before 1900 was to wipe out all germans. Genocide.because the jews new that germany being the leader and the largest country in Europe were 99percent christians.and were far advanced technologically in nearly everything that the germans did..hitlers greatest crime was getting rid of this jewish usery money.and the germans creating there own dept free money system.unlike America were now in our 2nd century of using Jewish dept money by the federal reserve since 1913.as an American if you're family has lived in America since 1913 your family generation s are owed 20million dollars thats been stolen from us.over the past 106 years.the gold and silver coinage replaced with worthless jewish pieces of green paper.gold for paper.not a bad scam.Jesus turned over there tables in Jerusalem 3thousand years ago and was murdered for it.he new a sin when he saw one..American Christian's today worshipping there slave masters.stupidity for education indoctrination for education..the.tavistock institute look them up and find out why every body's a Moran",

It relies on a semantic bait and switch in which people are expected to believe that it means hostility or prejudice against Jews. Indeed a major propaganda effort has been made to get people to think of Antisemitism as a disreputable indefensible irrational frothing-at-the-mouth hatred of Jews for what? ... the shape of their noses? I don't know. But the way the term is actually used is to label Gentiles who resist Jewish power, influence, privilege or political agendas. It is an Orwellian smear, a libel, a canard. And when the lachrymose memory of Jewish historical suffering is evoked with all its \"pogroms\" and now especially the Sacred Six Million then it becomes a blood libel.

Second, the parts of the Koran that are comprehensible are often times filled with hate and aggression because, once again, these are merely the thoughts of a seventh century man.

Makes perfect sense,\r\nhttps://jewsforjesus.org/publications/issues/issues-v22-n09/how-do-you-respond-when-people-say-that-the-jews-killed-jesus/ (this link comes from a Christian movement trying to covert Jews)\r\n\r\nSecond Bolshevism, I can agree that is an atrocity but to blame Jews is just sick. The only 'evidence' I have herd is that they have Jewish names. Having a Jewish name doesn't make you Jewish. Also the few leaders who were Jewish did not consider themselves Jewish. Although they apparently acknowledged the existence of a Yiddish minority group in their borders, they also banned religion, they executed rabbis, priests and who ever else was involved.\r\nhttps://mosaicmagazine.com/picks/history-ideas/2019/01/the-myth-of-judeo-bolshevism-and-the-realities-of-jewish-bolsheviks/\r\n\r\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Bolshevism\r\n\r\nThird banking deception, I have never seen evidence that Jews in mass have committed banking deception, although a Jew may have done this some time in history it doesn't mean all Jews have done this. To my knowledge and research this whole money grabber stereotype rose from two things. One) in the religion itself you as a Jew are obligated to help other Jews in financial issues( I've come across people who think this is selfish but your not entitled to someone else's money)\r\nTwo) it stems from when the British forced them to work that royal bank in England (don't know the time periodhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_antisemitism\r\n\r\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypes_of_Jews\r\n\r\n\r\nThird media lies. The idea that Jews control the media. Despite all the anti Zionist traction on the internet. Dispute the lefts anti Israeli movements, despite the lefts censorship and cherry picking of the Palestine-Israeli conflict. Despite sources manipulating historical instances such as the all famous 'USS Liberty' despite the media's cling the the king David hotel attack (which I do not condone)\r\n\r\nForth all Middle East conflicts, this same Middle East which created the three NOs. so Jews caused the Kuwait war?, Jews created isis?, Jews caused the Armenian genocide? The Jews caused the Taliban? Really? \r\n\r\nFinally Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The same Israel that offered Palestine peace and land 5 times, the same Israel that gave 50% of its land to Egypt and gave Palestine the Gaza Strip in the name of peace. The same Israel that warned Palestine citizens ahead of time that they would bomb. The same Palestine that forced its population to endure the bombing, the same Palestine that just recently launched like 200 to 450 to 700 rockets randomly into Israel https://youtu.be/1Fieioxcm-I (a link to emphasize what I said about the rockets)\r\nThe same Palestine (Hamas) that openly suggests the killing of all Jews, not just Israel (https://www.adl.org/news/article/hamas-in-their-own-words). The same Palestine that uses its population as meat shields. \r\nHOW COULD YOU JUSTIFY YOUR HATRED? (by the way i rereplied this)",

I am not fully Jewish, I am a Jewtile, and I put Yeshua HaMashiach (Jesus) before my heritage. But I love my Jewish brothers and sisters as if they were my own.\n\nThe Gentiles hate the Jews because they blame the Jews for Zionism. In some aspects, they would be correct. The political Zionists are Jews - but not Jews as you are, rather they are Jews who believe in themselves and their own pocket, you know, the bankers. The same bankers who sacrificed our people for generations, funding Jewish persecution. They are like Jesuits (corrupted Catholics). \n\nMa'am, I advise you look at what the New Covenant has to offer, for it has explained so much. Take pity unto the Gentiles, love them and forgive them, for how can we expect Adonai to forgive us, if we don't show forgiveness to others. \n\nThere is a Satanic plot to overthrow the world's governments, I have studied this for years, I understand what is to be. Political Zionism is a newfound Satanism, funded by the wealthy elites - the Jews are just as much targets of them as the Gentile. These Gentiles seem to believe th<b> e commo</b>n Jew is here to overthrow the White man in the West - no, they have it wrong. Now I advise the Goyims to check the Georgia Guidestones, it was built by a Zionist Freemason and it states \"keep the earth's population at 500 million.\" They want complete Genocide on the entire world (including the Jews) where only the celebrities, the bankers, the philanthropists and the politicians survive. I have all the proof.",

The false plan that was purposely released to turn the little people against one another? You fell for a lie. \n\nBy falling for that lie, you are affirming the plans of the Zionists and the Jesuits. My King is Jesus - Yeshua HaMashiach - I know what is to come. And when Yeshua comes back, every knee will bow and every tongue will confess His divinity. \n\nYour biggest mistake is blaming the <b> common </b>Jew for the actions of Zionists. You don't seem to blame Catholics for the actions of Jesuits. Why is that? Simply, because you hate Jews. You know, there are no differences between Jews and Gentiles  - both as sinful as one another, both as prideful as one another and both as stupid as one another. I say this as a Jewtile - a distant descendant of the Jewish<b>  race</b>, and an almost full blooded Gentile.\n\nIf you think that the Zionists are the only ones doing wrong - then you are more stupid than I thought. Your camp is doing it too chief. \n\nBut if you concern yourself with the plan of the hegalian dialectic Kalergi Plan, a predetermined problem, to create a reaction (you) and to make a solution (complete population control) then you are sadly mistaken. \n\nDon't forget, Zionists sold out th<b> e commo</b>n Jew long before they sold out you. Perhaps you should worry about the Noahide law instead of a fake issue. \n\nOh and by the way, repent to Yeshua HaMashiach, the One, True Son of the Living God; Adonai Elohim - the King of Kings, the Rock of The Earth and The Heavens, The Redeemer of Man and the Lamb That Was Slain.",

You have elites and lobbyists that push for mass immigration all over Europe  while insisting that Israel remains a Jewish state. You call any group of people that expresses Nationalist ideals Nazi's while many of your own people hold exactly the same ideals for their people. You have intellectuals in the Universities that have created terms such as 'Toxic masculinity' and 'White Privlidge.' You can be summarized as a predatory group that cries out as you strike people.",

Now when it comes to money, back in the day land was the main currency, agriculture and farming, Jews weren't allowed land for they were never considered equal, so they formed loaning systems that turned into banks, so yes, nowadays some Jews are descendants from them and they are very wealthy since money is considered the main currency today. However not all Jews are wealthy, the vast majority are not. All I'm saying is people who hate on Israel and Jews because of their stance their at the moment, calling us inhuman and what not have got to have a better look at their own, for I don't see people picking Europeans (English, French, Dutch Spanish etc..) and slandering them for their occupation on others land. So for those who decide to just point a finger at me and my people, their is no logical reason other than pure hate and/or fear.",

And in terms of Palestinians killed, only in retaliation to rockets and other attacks. What about thousand in Syria that have been killed and 100s of thousands in Lebanon? Don't see anyone making.

I think we are just ambitious, not all but we have an innate drive to not only survive but to really do our best? I mean, we aren't conquerers, in the sense that we try and dominate Everyone, look into history and it shows that although most muslims and christians had that pursuit to conquer and convert their ideologies, Jews are the opposite. Once again, I don't condone those in power that are Jews to do what they are doing with their power plays, they are my enemies because they are fighting against peace and work on keeping the power. But that's not a cultural thing, that's them abusing their power for the sake of control and to the detriment of society. But there are many within governments, banking and what not that do that in all nationalities and culture. It's the human disease... corruption",

So hergo they made Jews a scape goat for the true reason of Jesus's death making exuses why to forgive the roman empire, there are quite hard pieces of evidences supporring it.\nDo you have A CONCREATE information and hard EVIDENCES rhat the Jews are to blame?\nand don't answer with a steryotype about Jews.... I want concreate evidence not opinions about a group of people...\nBasically you have <b> nothing </b>to hate about Jewd you just seaeching for a scape goat for problems YOU have created in your life, It's so much easier to blame others for your mistakes, TAKE RESPONSIBILTIES ON YOUR ACTIONS YOU FILTHY WRECH!",

The word \"conspiracy\" or the phrase \"conspiracy theory\" do not inherently make such a notion false or fallacious.  What did you mean when you said \"just another conspiracy?\"\n\n\nRegardless, I abhor Christianity for its deep roots in Judaism, the notion of insoluble and undying obsequiousness to a cruel and dominating Lord, and the passive layers of impotence that are rife throughout the text.\n\n\nRome may very well have taken the mantle of Christianity with Constantine, but Rome culturally died after that, when they gave up their pagan religions and became monotheistic.",

Are you kidding me right now?\n\n\nBy the way, Jew, your mastery of Hegelian dialectics is fascinating. Furthermore, I agree with you that it's not only the wealthy Jews or the rootless international clique who are our enemies.  Plenty of our countrymen and indeed men in every <b> nation </b>join forces with the clique in order to assert power over their own countrymen.  We call those people Freemasons, and they are in league with the Jews.\n\n\nBut make no mistake, the Jews certainly are clearly the enemies of every<b>  race</b> on earth, and they have made it their goal to exert power over all of us.  I'm sure you're familiar with the Talmud and with the Kalergi plan, correct?\n\n\nThe Protocols might be \"a hoax,\" but it's strange how everything in them is coming to fruition.",

Why did we do it?  Well, Christianity played a large role.  This is why I say that Christianity is essentially Judaism for white people, because evangelicals have always had a soft spot for Jews.  Geopolitics played a big part, but the region wasn't as much of a concern then.  Now, much more.\n\n\nThe reason they hate you is because you took their land.  Should everyone have a land?  Arguably, yes, but you lost yours.  Had you wanted it back, you only had to but walk in and take it.  Instead, your people got us to do it for you.  Now, Israel is more of a money sink than anything.  We pour billions into a state that essentially gets our best weapons and resources and gives us little but geopolitical clout in return.  How much is one miniscule stable state worth when the securing of said state created conflict to begin with?\n\n\nI don't think I even need to elaborate on the fact that Israel is able to have the ethnostate that Europe isn't permitted anymore.  Why? Because ethnostates are strong, and we aren't allowed to be strong.  Our Jewish overlords want us gone, and for the most part, we're acquiescing to their dictatums.\n\n\nI find it rather dry that you complain about Israelis being killed and Palestinians being upset when you got us to take that land back for you.  Or are they not allowed to attempt to take it back?\n\n\nRemember the scores of innocents that Mossad and Netanyahu have killed in the \"defense\" of your land.  Perhaps now the whites can be allowed a little leeway when it comes to the displacement of native peoples from their land.",

But some facts merit mention:\n\n* In the US, Steven Miller has been actively promoting the racialization of Central American asylum seekers, which is a head scratcher given  all  that's outlined in this article.  AIPAC has been  mute.  \n\n* David Frum just published an article in the Atlantic magazine arguing for the freezing of all US immigration.  Sounds like he's trying to confuse the public with the argument that will be used against the Palestinians' right of return. 'A country has the right to say no to immigration.'\n\n* US Neocons forced the Iraqi invasion/destruction, and in the process destabilizing the Middle Esast. Millions were displaced and millions have entered the Europe, while its economies have yet to recover from the 2008 US-driven economic recession\n\n* Netanyahu, US casino owner Sheldon Adelson et al engineered  Jerusalem's and most recently the Golan Heights land grab.    Concurrently, some media headlines have been arguing there has been no reaction to the announcement to legitimize it .  Really? \n\n* The Likud Party issued a manifesto announcing the unilateral appropriation of the occupied territories.  \n\n* Bob Rubin & friends eliminated the Glass-Steagall Act, which allowed 'Sandy Weill' to create a financial supermarket meant to stimulate market competitiveness.   The ensuing looting caused the 2008 Great Recession & destruction of  American families.",

            "commentText": "I'm a Canadian and as a child in 1970s Alberta I was very curious about WW1 and WW2. I wanted to know why it happened! So I'd ask my Uncles, who all fought over there during WW2 and they'd either say it was 'bad business' and that was the end of that conversation, or they'd flat out refuse to talk to me about it. Sadly all my Uncles were drunks and suffered severe PTSD in a time when there was no help for our loved and respected war Veterans. So they'd 'self medicate' with lots of hard booze just so they could pretend they were okay.\nAnyways, one Uncle did tell me something, that the bad business he spoke of was indeed bad business, he told me the jews were hard on people with their money lending and the high interest rates they charged, <b> nothing </b>was regulated. He told me hard working German folks lost their homes and/or businesses to jews because the fine print on a signed contract was as binding as the proverbial handshake. He told me that shaking someone's hand to seal a deal at one time was as serious as it got, it meant something even in a court of law, not like today where it means pretty much<b>  nothing</b>. I remember those talks with my Uncle and I miss all my Uncles, they are all dead. As an adult I never once thought of researching the why of those wars till just a few years ago... WOW, the wool's been craftily put over our eyes, my Uncle did NOT lie to me, he just didn't... or couldn't tell me enough.",

Yet, will cite the Bible to manipulate others into accommodating or respecting their position.  You refer to Christians as stupid, which is quite offensive because clearly they are mostly stupid for assuming good faith on the part of so-called faithful Jews. Which they are not by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nThe truth is, the Jewish activity people object to is  carried out by outright villains who hide behind claims of biblical promise, are protected by a community of nepotism and <b> racist </b>ideology .  Meanwhile calling everyone else<b>  racist</b> and sowing racial conflict everywhere.\n\nAnd, also, Mossad did 9/11.  It's the truth. I'm not anti-Semitic. More and more people are waking up to this and other mischief carried out by SO-CALLED Jews.  SO-CALLED.  \n\nThe constant aggressive victim act is only going to further aggravate people, too.  But instead of heeding warnings to stop silencing and harassing every critic (see legislation around the world) the response is generally hutzpah to just double down and continue attacking regular society.  \n\nI'm assuming your answer to my question is no.",

There are laws against that. And the law of God forbids murder. But you neither believe in God nor his laws or words. Nor do you have any interest in truth.  \n\n A few reasons why the so-called Jews get all the Jews into trouble.\n\n1. Usury\n2. Weaponizing Moral degeneracy via entertainment, music, politics.\n3. Subversive Political mischief in general (communism, for example) which has brought death and destruction to many. \n\nThe Talmud itself just demonstrates the outright rejection of God in favor of new traditions. It's not the evidence of 9:11.  \n\nMossad did 9/11 because it brought the USA into endless military engagement with the 'enemies of Israel'. And there is plenty of evidence to demonstrate the point.  The strongest argument so-called Jews have, to keep people away from the truth, is the aggressively instilled fear of being labeled anti-Semitic or a <b> Nazi </b>sympathizer (which often carries legal, professional, and social consequences). But there's really no going back once you see what's been happening.  \n\nJust like there was no going back after seeing the truth about leftist ideologies, idols, atheism, etc.  the truth about Zionist crimes and villains among so-called Jews is just another thing to get clear on.  \n\nThere are many areas that have been and need to be cleared up. \nThis is just another area.",

And often that lie is harder to question so therefore becomes accepted as Truth. Probably find it in Statecraft and propaganda 101.\n\nJews who want to protect themselves against  anti semitism should stop supporting the horrendous terror state of Israel and political Zionism in general.\n\nLord Rothschild was rad of the Zionist council when he received the Balfour Declaration. And to claim Zionism and Rothschild with all their war profiteering go hand in hand is now deemed anti semitic hate speech - as defined by our Zionist controlled media. Inverting of the truth again. \n\nPalestine didn't exist is now the Israeli trope peddled by Hasbara. Palestinians weren't a people. This is now the line they push: inverting the truth once again...\n\nThe day that Jewish leaders start condemning this behaviour instead of supporting or turning a <b> blind </b>eye is the day that antisemitism will decrease and perhaps eventually disappear. \n\nNow watch the Zionists claim I'm anti Semitic for saying this.\n\nOf course those poor kids don't deserve that treatment it's disgusting. All minorities will experience something like this at some point. We don't need special laws and words (antisemitism) for when it is directed at Jews though.\n\nIn America they are redefined anti semitism to include such broad issues it is dangerous and demonstrates Zionist power. \n\nPerhaps Jews are as indoctrinated as the rest of us if not even more? They appear to be being used by Israel and the political Zionist movement to further the agenda of the Zionist elites who appear to be the cause of so many issues and problems. If only more would work with us instead of against us.",

He calls EVERYTHING that way, if it pleases him.\nHis blackmail is well known. Also, don't forget, if there appear any swastika symbols on a synagogue, it usually done by a Zionist vandal, to blame an Arab person. Especially in Israel\nIf there is ANY anti-semitism around, the reason is simple: I blame the Zionists in Israel, because of their murderous genocide of the Palestinians. If they keep murdering the Palestinians by the thousands yearly, anti-semitism will prevail. \nThe British Jews have only themselves to blame, after all it was the 1917 Balfour Agreement, which sent British Zionist into Palestine.",

The UK Muslims are brazen and offensive and what is going on here is this:  ANTISEMITISM TO HURT OR SCARE THE JEWISH PEOPLE AWAY AND REPLACE THEM WITH SHARIA MUSLIMS.\n* Note:  As Judeo Christians, Messianic believers we are to support our Jewish brothers and sisters and love them, it is a commandment of God Almighty to pray for Jerusalem and to be keepers of the peope of our holy books. Judaism is a beautiful thing, I love my Bible and it is much bigger than me or you or Europe or the whole world, and in that Bible we are to realize that the Bible is inherently Jewish and it is what our beloved Christianity is born out of.  BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO LOVE ISRAEL AND CURSED ARE THOSE WHO HATE ISRAEL (not just the land but the people).  If you succumb to antisemitism and permit this to happen in the UK, God will give the UK over to the idolators as a curse upon the UK and France and you will end up serving Muslims and antisemites!!!!\n\nMay God Almighty bless and protect my Jewish brothers and sisters and many in the United States stand in Solidarity with Judaism and Israel \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\u2665\ufe0f\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\n\nShalom Y'Israel shalom ani \n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1",

Judea was not a country in 1933. historical Judea was just a part of the Palestinian territory which was under occupation of Britain, however in 1933 Jews (mostly in the US) boycotted German trade after Hitler took power which makes sense because Hitler had already made it clear that he did not want Jews in Germany.",

If as a society you operate a lot in the background and you use Cabalistic manipulation methods then when those things get exposed the backlash is extra sever and I think we're seeing people waking up to an influence that appears to be predominantly Jewish. The question if this is truly Jewish or representative for all Jews is another thing but Talmud texts and overrepresentation of Jews in media, banking, tech etc. isn't helping to soften that imagine of jews having an unhealthy influence that could be perceived as intrusive and dangerous against the interest of the non Jewish communities Jews live amongst. People simply don't care about people being smart or situations being fair when the SHTF economically. There are just to many Jews being to openly arrogant about their influence and it's not helping Jews in general, and looking at the globalist mystery religion Luciferian cults and their agenda it seems they wanna end all religions including Judaism? Who knows time will tell. All I k ow that they use up all people including Jews when they mention globalism and a one world government.",

When I was a small child I heard my mother say to my father, \"Did you know that the family across the road are Jews?\". It always made me wonder what it is about Jewish people that gets them disliked all around the world. Strange but if you can't tell that someone is Jewish, you find yourself not having that prejudgement kind of attitude, but when they stand out as Jews, there's so much that sets them apart from society; their busy-body air, the out-of-place clothing, their nonchalance and superiority complex, but most of all, their religion. Muslims despise them most...Yet in Britain, only white, non Muslims are being encouraged to pretend they like Jews...  My first job was delivering food for a Jewish family. They were lovely people and often invited me over for dinner. Yet their was <b> nothing </b>about them that made them stand out as Jewish, and that's my point. It's people that stand out in this manner that alienate themselves from the rest of society...",

We as a species must learn as an extra intelligent species, capable of many great things, both good and bad, that we must wise up, there are more powerful forces at play.

I dont 'follow' the religion (pray or anything) however I find it is much more affective to better myself as a human being through the betterment of myself. In all religions the vast majority are just following rules, not understanding the meaning of it, it's set up to keep people moral but it's called <b> blind </b>faith if not understood correctly and it is very destructive. But the same goes for any system in a country governed by laws, people lose the concept of morality as they just keep within the white lines, they are much more liable to be destructive if those rules are no longer enforced. That's the problem with guide lines, there comes a point where letting go of the \u2018crutch' is a healthy thing to do. As for your hatred, it's very delusional, have you ever interacted with a religious person (had a reasonable conversation or shared a meal?). Hatred is not healthy for you. In all societies there are good and bad people, but in general, historically, Jews have not been about enforcing their opinions on others as opposed to the christians or Muslims, who killed anyone in opposition who wouldn't convert to their ideologies. So where is the TRUTH in what you are saying?",

And whoever saves a life, it is as though he had saved all mankind.' (Qur'an, 5:32)\r\nHadit: Abu Huraira reported: The Prophet & Messenger of God Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, said, 'A prostitute had once been forgiven. She passed by a dog panting near a well. Thirst had nearly killed the dog, so she took off her sock, tied it to her veil, and drew up some water. Allah forgave her for that.'\r\nONE SHOULD BE GOOD TO ALL HUMANS AND THE CREATION OF GOD TOO: ... Most of you don't condemn the Jews when they illegally kill and demolish Muslims homes in Israel...? Every thing has a time decreed...\r\n\r\nCare of Nature: Abdullah ibn Amr reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, passed by Sa'd while he was performing ablution (washing hands and feet for prayer). The Prophet said, 'What is this extravagance?' Sa'd said, 'Is there extravagance with water in ablution?' The Prophet said, 'Yes, even if you were on the banks of a flowing river.'\r\nMore:  [LINK] ",

I had anti Irish hate speech directed at me as well. I had many uncles and friends of the family who had abandoned Judaism and had become Christians. I have met many since who have become Muslim or their ancesters had in large numbers. 20% of Spanish people have Jewish descent.

The numbers of the latter <b> dwarf </b>the former.

Anyways, I'm not justifying the Arab slave trade, but what I'm saying is that it was far better than the Atlantic. \nCastration was done in the church in Sinai by the way, not by Arabs themselves; and actually, Jews were the ones who controlled the trade, not Arabs.",

And whoever shall save an innocent life it shall be as if they have saved all of mankind\"\n\nBut here's the thing, people don't quote the entire verse. They only quote a part of it.\n\nThat verse on the Qu'ran is referring to the children of Israel- the Jews.\n\nThe reason why is because the verse is paraphrasing a verse from the Talmud. \n\nThere's a passage in the Talmud that says pretty much the same thing. \n\nApparently that passage from the Talmud was very popular among the Jews during Muhammad's time.\n\nSo that verse in the Qu'ran that people quote to try prove Islam is peaceful is actually quoting a verse from the Talmud and therefore is a Jewish teaching",

Antisemitism,\n\n2. Holocaust,\n\nand \n\n3. Conspiracy Theory.\n\nreplace it by the words Justice wit<b> h zer</b>o tolerance, if you allow justice for all,  Semite jew will be protected, but if we try to protect the weaPon of mass destruction, the Semitism, than you are protecting these thugs and victimizing the real Semite Jew,are u welling to go to next WW to protect and strengthen these thugs and make Jew victims, if u know you will not, now u know.\n\nFor this dude, don't go to QURAAN to get protection, stay with your own holly book, the Torah which is a scare book and Talmud which is a satanic book, here people discussing the satanic anti human Talmudic book, stick with it, and u can't defend it because you have no leg to stand on, don't try sir, you are exposed.\n\nworld is not ready to buy your lies, 2 worlds wars and over 100 millions is more than enough, I recommend all to see on u tube a documentary called, the rise of Putin and the fall of the oligarchs, Putin learned the lesson from WWII germany, the same scenario, same thugs, same victims, just watch it, it will shock you. \n\nMy last advice, don't be close freind to the Zionist Antisemite, learn from 1946 and 1967, the blowing up of the British officer In Jerusalem, and the blowing up of USSN Liberty, these are a drop of crimes committed by these heinous criminals against their best friends, guess from where they gets their political, financial and weaponry to continue occupation of Palestine, you guessed it right, so do u want to be friends of your killer?.\n\nWatch this documentary:\nThe Rise of Putin and The Fall of The Russian-Jewish Oligarchs (1/2)\n [LINK] \n\nThe Rise of Putin and The Fall of The Russian-Jewish Oligarchs (2/2\n [LINK] \n\nThese thugs believe in : \n\n'Never to attempt to win by force what can be won by deception'\nMachiavellian quote.\nAnd who is Machiavelli, is the same Antisemite criminal.",

Now saying that... muslims do this in name and not in practice and have been shown to kill the poor animals brutally almost cutting off the head.. and then call it \"HALAL\". \nIts like sticking a pig (if they were Kosher) and letting it bleed out... basically until it got tired and sleepy and then kill it. That has been done for ages and its similar for animals killed under Kosher laws. But you're not supposed to tie it to a stake and cut the fucking head off - that I agree is animal cruelty.",

Jews own and run all media platforms! They own and run Hollywood. They're the ones pushing <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>an<b> d transgende</b>r and o<b> ne gend</b>er agendas. \n\nThey're the ones that put out rap music and other trash. They run the court system. They financed the slave trade and they finance the wars of the world. They sit here acting like they're oppressed but how are they oppressed when they run the world? Banks, finance, insurance companies, education, court system etc. They point the camera at everyone else besides themselves. \n\nThey're devils i tell you! Pushing the opposite of love, compassion, family values and the natural law of the land. Everyone knows they bullied and killed Palestinians and pushed them out the land. Which is still going on, but somehow they get a free pass. They bring up the holocaust and still get paid reparations from America while the American government taxes American citizens to pay them<b> . \n\nNob</b>ody talks about the American holocaust where millions and million<b> s of b</b>lack and native Americans were raped, murdered and enslaved. But everyone talks about the holocaust and what happened to them. They're snakes! Calling themselves 'Gods chosen people'. If 'god' is the devil then it suits them, because they are the opposite of any and everything that's holy.",

They are the one's that made this happen which makes them the enemy. I'm neither left or right i simply have a mind of my own and do my own research and if someone like me can figure this out why haven't any of you who are far more intelligent than me? I can only come to one conclusion you are one of them, if im wrong feel free to respond, i'd love to hear your thoughts on why no one cares or says anything when an IDF soldier kills an unarmed child at a protest, film's it and says this is going to make a great movie then gets away with it!! Imagine if that was your child, how would you feel then? Also why doesn't Israel have to sign the nuclear treaty when every other country has to? All we hear on the news is Iran this Iran that, there's never any mention of Dimona in Israel, sound's a bit one sided to me",

So long as Jews were submitting to Islamic rule - they had \"peace\".\nThe reason the Islam hates Jews = because all of Islam claims all Jewish prophets in the <b> old </b>testament as their own (and even Jesus as muslim). \nFor Israel to exist (and even just Jews existing) negates all of Islam and is finger in their eye because it proves Islam is fake and built off another's religion.",

There are a whole handful of reliegons that very closely share the same story with the names changed slightly.  I'm quite sure if we had access to real history we would find that most religeons, the ones that share the same stories at least, were all created by the same group. It's impossible that all these different religeons could share the same basic storyline. It's more likely that a single group created these stories to help enslave us all, which they did.",

This new situation transformed Jewish existence. Their fortunes changed in legal, demographic, social, religious, political, geographical, economic, linguistic and cultural terms - all for the better.\"\n\nWhile in Europe and lands previously held by the crusades Jews were tortured. This is because they believed the Jews had killed Jesus. Interestingly, after the fall of Spain from the Muslim Jews were forced to convert to Christianity for many reasons. This is evident from historical sources. \n\nThe positive light of Islam often hidden and obstructed by rebellious groups such as Isis and the like.",

China ruling Tibet, Eastern Turkistan and the China Sea are the same as Zionism. Even worse is Crimea being in Russia that was never Russia it was Tatarstan. See all the stupidity caused by Zionism. We know from DNA that Palestinians are the Jews and Samarian Hebrews who did not run away from the Romans and they have a longer tenure than Zionists. Indeed Palestinians often still use Jewish symbols above doors, follow Jewish Customs and on their graves. About 20% of peninsula Arabs have Jewish descent especially in Yemenis. In to the Desert was the obvious place to flee when the Romans came. Farmers did not as David Ben Gurion said. We know that probably out of the 100 million people of Jewish descent most are either today Christian, Muslim or Atheists. \n\nIf you stop<b>  ethnic</b> cleansing in Syria,n Afghanistan, Iraq and Israel there would be no Muslim Migrants. That is the opposite to what Putin wants. He would like to displace the Muslims in the Middle East to Europe hoping it will cause disorder.",

Jewish people are just like other people, the only difference is their religion. The fact that difference in religion can make people be so hostile towards one another is disgusting. Jewish people shouldn't be discriminated against just like any other group shouldn't be discriminated against. To say that the only Jewish people that have feelings are those surrounded by white people is also ridiculous. A Jewish person can be white, <b> black,</b> Asian, it doesn't make sense and that is a<b>  racist</b> comment. I'm just shocked that people can be this close minded and ignorant. Maybe it's time to expose yourself to other people, so you can understand that most people are good genuine people.",

Sad that Orthodox Jews are dragged and hosed down in the streets of Israel. Of course, mainstream media censored 10,000 Orthodox Jews protesting against Netanyahu's Unholy Visit in NY City a few years ago. I wonder, do people even know what the reasons why Quebec wants to separate from the rest of Canada, because when I was living in New Brunswick, most people were saying things like, \"The French just don't like The English.\" Of course, I had to learn a little more why they want to separate from the rest of Canada. Do any of you know the reasons why Quebec wants to separate?",

This is a key issue.\nNot all Jews are Zionist who support Israel, turning a <b> blind </b>eye to the evil the state  represents in terms of its behaviour since its inception and the World Zionist organisation's behaviours before then.\n\nBut the problem is most Jews do seem to support Israel unconditionally.

Understandable with the holocaust being told as it is told...  repeatedly in everyone's faces, with no mention of all the other genocides and mass\nMurders that have taken place. We assume the holocaust narrative is to indoctrinate us gentiles but perhaps it's more about cementing the unconditional support for Israel and Zionism\nIn the Jews worldwide? \n\nHow do we get more Jews in the west to condemn Israel and Zionism?\n\nHow do we get them to stop embracing Jewish exceptionalism and supremacy?",

You act like its coming from nowhere...but when I realised that some prejudiced against Jews ( as a whole not as individuals)were actually true it made me really uneasy, like the fact that American international policy is highjacked by Zionist neocons and aipac and very few Jews rise against it publicly. I mean if we do, we are labeled as fascist or anti semitism it is pure mind control. So the prejudice of \" Jew plot\" and \" Jew drags people to war\" applies here. \nOr like the fact that banking system is indeed a Jewish invention ( not necessarily a critic here), jews can say it we can t.\n\nSo I know most of the Jew want to live their life peacefully as all of us, but it is like you don t realise anti-Semitism comes from the actions of your elite. \n\nI am really genuine here. I just want to know what you feel about this.",

Yes Zionists (*Secular* Jews who lobby for Israel) play a very prominent role in American foreign policy, and are quite deceitful  (which as a religious Jew it makes my blood boil) But as far as I have read American Soldiers have never fought along Israeli troops in any of it's conflicts. \n\n2. And the fact that Jews don't speak out the problem is twofold the first is that the Atheistic liberal Jews (who are a minority)have most of the jewish community in a strangle hold and will use any means to silence any opposition inside the community so Jewish conservatives cannot challenge them without being put back in line, second is that ideologically it's split down the middle and we do not want a sectarian schism. In regards to banking it's not a Jewish invention, it was an industry we were allowed to take over since Christians viewed it as sinful and since we legally weren't allowed to own land it was better than abject poverty.\n\n3. In regards to the Jewish elites, if you would specify that we wouldn't feel as attacked as we do. We hate people like the Rothschild's (may their lineage be damned) \n\n4. My personal opinion is that Jews shouldn't exist outside Israel's boarders, we should stop taking aid from the US, become Isolationist and  leave everyone alone and expect to be left alone. In regards to banking and media we have no business controlling it (except in Israel). But if we are attacked we should not expect your help, but since we are isolated in said region we should operate on the non aggression principle (we will not strike first, but if you attack us we will make you regret it dearly) with our Arab neighbors. And with the rest of the world, we stay out of their business, and trade with them.",

No, that's bullshit and many antisemites or hate groups are very good at cloaking their agendas or beliefs around legitimate issues like Israel/Palestine issue or Gaza. This isn't the 1930s, they have to be a bit more creative and appear more genuine, less threatening to moderates or even left-wing anti-globalization activists and they dupe a lot of people into believing their \"hate\" is really legitimate criticisms. For every Jeremy Cornyn, there's a David Duke or a Richard Spencer, or some other Christian Identity leader or some alt-right idealogue. Trump may be going to jail or get impeached eventually, but they'll still be around and unfortunately even if a moderate candidate takes power(Republican or Democrat) and international politics becomes more normal, it's going to be difficult to keep far-right activists or candidates from regaining momentum at some point. Spencer, Duke, __ Christian Identity alt righters will still be around and feel that their message might be accepted again if they polished or refined the rhetorical slogans, got a more savvy, politically keen leader who won't make such a fool of himself on Twitter like Trump has. That's the scenario most moderate Americans like me are terrified of after Trump is gone and someone much worse but more intelligent, and better political instincts, charisma, and the right image to push to Americans who won't necessarily see him as such a imminent threat at first.",

Do you think it was always the tavern/bars fault for booting the drunk? Well the same goes for the jews. Hmmm!?!?!? One tribe booted from 109 different countries! Over 500 times amongst the 109!

In fact actually Poland is the only country in Europe that during WW2 created a special organistion to help Jews which was called \"\u017begota\". Also during German occupation Poland created underground courts which prosecuted traitors, collaborators and informators. Those polish courts were punishing to death polish traitors who acted against Jews so you can't say that Poland participated in Holocaust. There were only traitors who did participate in it and <b> nobody </b>is denying that but only less that 0,1% of polish population collaborated with Germans at that time so saying that Poland participated in the Holocaust as you did is just wrong and very inaccurate. The law that you mentioned was created to prevent false and inaccurate statements that could be misunderstood - mainly it was about the Polish death camps statement which suggests that death camps where polish but they were not.

Jews historically make great victims. They compensate for your mother's failure to convince you that there really is no boogyman. If kept under control, anti-Semitism is also good for the Jews. They would disappear without it. In the US, for example, almost 70% of Jews marry outside of the faith. This is why the current president has three Jewish grandchildren. It's also good for Israel.

You won't find any of this nonsense in a standard history such as \"Peter Kenez's \"A History of the Soviet Union from Beginning to End\" which is very popular and easily obtainable on amazon.com. However, for this one (rather unimportant) question, why don't you simply Google \"Jews in the Bolshevik Revolution\" or \"Jews in the Soviet Government\"?  You'll find that the proportion was about 5%. Most Jews  Russia in the early 20th century were religious fanatics living in scrubby ghetto villages in eastern Russia and western Poland, the so-called \"Pale of Settlement.\" Few of them spoke Russian, and they didn't identify as Russians. The more educated Jews who lived in metropolitan areas were largely excluded from the armed forces, government work, or big business and had little political power.\n      Nevertheless, if I were a Jew in Russia at that time, I would have most certainly empathized with the Bolsheviks and the early Communists. I can't imagine that Jews would have supported the Czar. Communism was an Utopian ideology and promised liberation and equality. It was only in the Stalinist regime that the <b> Communist </b>Party also turned anti-Semitic.",

If Jews, who are fewer than 2% of the US population, control the news and entertainment industry, the banks, the Federal Reserve, the medical and dental professions, the universities, the NBA and the NFL., you have to wonder what is wrong with the other 98% of the American people. Are they stupid and ignorant, as most Europeans believe, or just shiftless and lazy?",

They are the one's that made this happen which makes them the enemy. I'm neither left or right or religious i simply have a mind of my own and do my own research and if someone like me can figure this out why haven't any of you who are probably far more intelligent than me? I can only come to one conclusion you are one of them, if im wrong feel free to respond, i'd love to hear your thoughts on why no one cares or says anything when an IDF soldier kills an unarmed child at a protest, film's it and says this is going to make a great movie then gets away with it!! Imagine if that was your child, how would you feel then? Also why doesn't Israel have to sign the nuclear treaty when every other country has to? All we hear on the news is Iran this Iran that, there's never any mention of Dimona in Israel, sound's a bit one sided to me! And as for Muslims why is it they keep coming to Christian countries and then start demanding to ban thing's like Christmas, a St George's Flag, Father's day and anything else that offends them? There's many thing's that offends us about you so if you don't like what you see and can't cope with it then you know where the door is, simple",

There is truth and integrity to what I, yet it certainly was worded in an unsophisticated manner. I read it  and saw the error in the language. You have been severely mislead and it's not your fault. Hopefully there are some points there to show you a different perspective.\n You might be aware pride or hubris for a Christian is not a good thing, and the darker forces that Christians (vessels for light in this world) call the Devil can easily deceive good Christians, which is what has happened to you and many others. \nYour bible says My people die from a lack of knowledge. That here for many Christian Zionists is what has happened. There was no such thing as a Christian Zionist until the Devil with his money swindled created such a thing. They are not Israel.  The Hex symbol should have you mildly alarmed if your not already.\nMy Roman Catholic Irishman returning to Rome analogy is the swindle here, but the Judaizing Turks for that is what they are have conned you, which again is not being your fault The devil is intricate, subtle and rather clever and sophisticated. Hoodwinked alot of people not just yourself.\nHave a wonderful day and God bless you and your family and friends",

I am sure people have paid for boats etc. But in Europe for the most they don't need boats, they can just walk through. We all know why people can be anti-semitic, the point is who is doing it. I have a feeling it could be muslims responsible in the UK. Thats what I want to know.\n\nThe US & UK hold the same values and principles, but I think we are in a slightly different political environment at the moment. We still have a regressive left government in power. I know Tories are meant to be right leaning, but with us I would say left and right politics has been non-existent for a long time.\n\nAs priority, I see how easily the islamic scripture can be used to corrupt peoples moral code.\nJudaism would be a lot lower on my list, but to be honest thats because of my ignorance to that faith - I could be completely wrong.",

In the USA politicians obey the commands of AIPAC. I am very suspicious of every move Israel makes. No more \u2018Onward Christian Soldiers'! Israel is a world ranking military power. How come it never gets to fighting its own battles requiring the deaths of Israelis?",

Rupert Murdoch - part Jewish and a Jewish/Israel supporter - has admitted that he uses his media empire to push HIS agenda.\n   It could, also,  be argued that the US support for \"rebels\" in Syria ( prompted - many would say - by Jewish pressure ) has lead to a humanitarian disaster for the region AND destabilised Western Europe.\nIndeed, a case could be put forward for the fact than the <b> refugee </b>camps in Calais were a winning factor in the UK voting to leave the E.U.",

I'm not there all the time so not saying it doesn't exist but on this scale?\n\nSpeaking to many Jewish people and athiest-jewish friends, the isolation is from within as with the muslim communities in Britain. I've only ever had one bad encounter with a Jewish person when I asked him for directions and he said 'you're not worthy of my time' and walked off. What an asshole that guy was.\n\nOn the other hand I've been attacked and accosted many times while in predominantly muslim areas where I've been chased by a group of 6 or 7 20-25 year <b> old </b>muslim lads on my way home from work shouting 'no whites in this area after dark' they had sticks and throwing pieces of brick, I was bricking myself while running.\n\nSaying all that with Christianity on the decline, the disconnect between people is near complete. People are happy in their own self-indulged bubble, constant consumer lifestyle; buying a lot of stuff they really do not need. \n\nSad times for Britain.\n\nOnce an empire falls, it eats itself from the inside out.",

Not just to Jewish people but also to many groups, all of which is an outlet and are very rarely only attacking one group. \n\nBut on your point on one in twenty could be low, I would have to totally disagreed. Agreed most people with these opinions won't act, however that's still too outlandish.\n\nIn 2016 there was a reported 1,200 hate crimes against Jewish people in Britain. Lets say another 1,200 didn't report what happened to them, making a total of around 2,400 hate crimes against Jewish people. \n\nNow let's say out of the supposed three million people with anti-semetic views in England, only one percent would commit hate crimes against Jewish people, that's 30,000 hate crimes a year. Not even close to real stats. Let's say one percent of that one percent would physically harm a Jewish person because of their anti-semetic views. That would be around 3,000 violent attacks against Jewish people a year. That's still higher than the number of reported and my assumed unreported cases. \n\nLook at statistics and not conjecture. It will give you a better view of the world and country we live in.\n\nSo surely you can't still agree with this?",

Wouldnt the bus have obscured most of them anyway?",

People think Jews rule because they own banks and money, are you retarded?, that would be at most 1 or 2 families which happen to be Jewish, not an entire 25 million group of people, I saw poor jews living on the streets when I was in Israel, also most of the Jews in Israel and in the world are not even rich they are middle class. Also most bank owners in the world are no\u0442 jews, for example the Rockefellers are not jews, Morgan is not jew,  Murdock is not jew..etc  Often ppl calling \"jewish\" those they hate, for example Kalergi was NOT jewish.. Some Jewish families happen to own some big banks, big deal, just like some Arab families happen to own the whole petroleum business, difference is that jews got on the top on their own, this arabs families were just born to kings.",

Does that remind you of any other religious group that are told the same..? A semite according to the english dictionary is a person or group of people who speak a Semitic  language.. these can be called jews or arabs.. (palestinian arabs).\n\nMY POINT: I condemn the actions israel have and continue to impose on the palestinians.. does that mean i hate jews... NO!.. because it sounds as absubd as a person condeming the actions of the soviet union.. does that mean they hate all russians.?\n\nHow could i stand for the liberation of one set of semites.  And then be called an anti-Semitic.. lol.. NICE TRY!.. the term anti-semitism is being thrown around very quickly by jews.. i got to give it to them.. its a very smart and calculated use of the term, for the reason to simply silence your voice, shutdown the dialogue of bringing attention to a matter..! Anti-semitism does exist!  of course!.. and to those ignorant people who attack on others because of a different religious ideaolgy.. i say <b> nothing.</b> you have to help yourself to eradicate your hate. Peace,love  and light.. shalom..",

It's Israel which is a fascist state that is conducting a genocide against the Palestinians, it's aim no different than Hitler's the eradication of a people. The only difference is the time span and the means. The criticism of Israel's genocidal policies as well as it's fascist nature is in no way the same as hatred for Jewish people in the same way Anti-Nazism isn't hatred to German people. That being said actual antisemitism must be combated and it disturbs long progress in the assimilation of Jews in the general population.",

I'm going to go out on even more of a limb - I think Channel 4 News is 100% aware of this but has decided to pretend that it's not the case.  I think TRUTH is vital in addressing any issue.  The problem with liberals is that they are more concerned about whether something is offensive than whether it is true.  In order to deal with this issue, the government needs to talk to Muslim community leaders.  Because the Muslim community is where most of this antisemitism is to be found.",

The reality is likely they are no different than anyone else if you follow history. Yet, their recent memory is strong after the holocaust. It has been a great way for the leaders of Judaism to control and keep in line Jews. Otherwise they would be like the Jews/ Hebrews who did not go into exile and stayed in the Roman Province of Palestine. They may have started as Nazarenes and Samaritans but Constantine forced them to become Christians at the pain of death. When the Crusaders became, 85% of them converted to Islam. https://youtu.be/wMCmUz7Z-9E",

I just wish that you would also be as honest about the fact that Christianity is behind much of the Jew hatred in the world today. The fact that the Christian bible calls Jews the 'synagogue of satan' and says that we are responsible for killing your man god, are a few of the main reasons Jews have been so heavily persecuted over the last 2 millennium. Thank goodness Christianity no longer has the power in the world it once did, one less thing for Jews to worry about.",

If you are claiming to be my intellectual superior, LOL thanks for the joke. I am not obligated to inform lackwits like you who are stupid enough to make personal (and angry insulting) claims about me when you only know that I dont believe the 6 million bs. That just makes you look very stupid and too lazy to do your own research. You know what they say when your opponent uses insults at you in an argument, like the petty ones you just used? Oh you dont, well go research it. The other phrase that comes to mind while responding to you is, ignorance is bliss. You are probably not even irish by the true meaning of the word. No true Irishman would shill for jews.",

In addition to this, whilst the Germans were fighting on the Western front after Russia pulled out of the war, politicians in Berlin were suing for peace because of the blockade of food for the country leading to famine across Germany, this in addition to a mutiny by the german navy, and with the Americans joining into the war and adding more and more men to the front, led to Germany's surrender.  Hitler was in hospital at the time of the surrender, and it infuriated him that the politicians sued for peace whilst so many German men died willingly for their Country, and because the blame was directed on the Jews, this is amongst the main reason why Hitler hated the Jews, because he blamed them for Germany becoming a powerless country and losing its empire\nIf you have netflix watch the documentary 'Armistice', it will give you a small background to the end of WW1 and say about the Jews being blamed, this is useful to remember then whilst seeing how the Nazis came to power and led to the persecution of Jews\nThe documentary is also on Youtube if you don't have netflix, but netflix has a better quality version, here's the Youtube version:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0H6EaIK2o&t=937s",

In case you didn't know they're not in the EU.\n\nThe UK has been multicultural for decades, even before the EU in 1993 and EEC in 1973.

The EU had<b>  nothing</b> to do with that<b> , nothin</b>g about closing borders or keeping people out. We just want fair immigration and a level playing field for all.\n\nanti-Semitism is just a tool used to shame and silence a valid concern over EU immigration and it h<b> as nothi</b>ng to do with the Jews or any ot<b> her r</b>ace, creed, colour or religion. Its just press and media manipulation.\n\nEvery country has a minority that is unhappy with difference. A true xenophobe (if you look up the definition). In the UK a Jew is not really considered a problem and never has been, but as with any large collective there is always a small minority that can't understand, handle or accept difference. That's not hate, it's intolerance and ignorance.\n\nHate is a very powerful emotion and one that is attributed way to rapidly to others simply to demonise them. How about teaching instead of punishing... Maybe then bit by bit this problem can be addressed properly.",

White Caucasians are the True Semites. \nOUR ANCESTORS FORGOT WHO WE ARE!!!!!!!\n\nHere are the \u2018Lost' Tribes or The Twelve Tribes of Israel:\n\nThese are Jacob/Israel's Twelve Sons who were or became The Twelve Patriarchs and progenitors of twelve clans that became 12 modern western nations.\n\nJoseph, whom Jacob loved, reperesented by Joseph's two sons Ephraim and Manasseh - the inheritors, Benajamin the youngest son, Simeon, Levi - The Priesthood, Judah - The Sceptre and Royalty, Reuben - the eldest son, Issacah, Zebulon, Gad, Asher, Dan, Naphtali.   \n\nJoseph Ephraim = Anglo-Saxon England (The Saacae or Saaka \u2013 Isaac's sons = Saxons) and Her Anglo-Saxon Commonwealth \u2013 Australia, Canada, NZ and S Africa (Now stolen).\n\n(Joseph) Manasseh = Anglo-Saxon USA (The Saacae \u2013 Isaac's sons)\n\nSimeon = Scotland (The Scythians) and Scottish descendants everywhere.\n\nLevi = Wales, (The Druids = descendants of The Levitical Priesthood with many butchered by the Romans in 46 AD) Cornwall and The Walloons of Belgium and Welsh descendants everywhere.\n\nJudah (The Jutes) = Northern Ireland (The <b> Red<b>  </b</b>>Hand Flag of Zarah), Scotland and some dispersed in England with some also still dispersed in Western Europe including Germany (Assyria). \n\nBenjamin = Norway, Iceland and Denmark.\n\nDan = (The Tuatha de Danaan) Southern Ireland and Irish descendants everywhere.\n\nReuben = Northern Gallic France = Paris, Brittany and Normandy and Gallic French descendants everywhere.\n\nZebulon pronounced Zeebulon \u2013 a haven for ships = Holland (the Zuider Zee) and Dutch descendants everywhere.\n \nGad = Flanders (modern Belgium) including The Walloons.\n\nIssachar = Switzerland.\n\nNaphtali = Finland.\n\nAsher = Sweden and Swedish descendants everywhere.\n\n13 tribes listed in all due to Joseph's two sons Ephraim & Manasseh both inheriting.\n\nFrom the Declaration of Arbroath to the Pope 1320 AD:\n\n'Most Holy Father and Lord, we know and from the chronicles and books of the ancients we find that among other famous nations our own, the Scots, has been graced with widespread renown. They journeyed from Greater Scythia by way of the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Pillars of Hercules, and dwelt for a long course of time in Spain among the most savage tribes, but nowhere could they be subdued by an<b> y rac</b>e, however barbarous. Thence they came, twelve hundred years after the people of Israel crossed t<b> he <b> R</b</b>>ed Sea, to their home in the west where they still live today.'\n\nDaniel 9:7 (KJV) O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee. \n\nBritain consists of five of the Twelve Tribes of Israel - Ephraim = England; Simeon = Scotland; Wales and Cornwall = Levi; Judah = Northern Ireland and Scotland; Dan = Southern Ireland.\n\nThe British Gaelic<b>  and</b> Old English tongues are Hebrew in origin, this has been proven by linguistic scholars.\n\n\"The English tongue agreeth with the Hebrew a thousand times more than with the Latin.\"  \n\n- William Tyndale \u2013 multi-linguist and early translator of the English Bible.\n\nThe Saaca or Saacea (Isaac's sons = saxons) came from the lands of the Medes and Parthians where the Assyrians (Germans) placed them after taking the Northern Kingdom of Israel captive in 725 BC.\n\nThe Scythians (The tribe of Simeon - The Scots) came from the same area between the Caspian Se<b> a and </b>Black Sea and north <b> of the</b> Black Sea.\n\nSir Francis Drake and Elizabeth I both knew England was Israel - privately QE II also knows.\n\nJoshua 1:3 (KJV) Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses. \n\nThe Mayflower American founding fathers (the Puritans) all knew that England was Israel and planted Israel in the promised land of the New World - New England.\n\nThe word British is from the Hebrew words 'Berith' and 'Ish'. Hebrew Berith = Covenant and Hebrew Ish = man so British means Covenant Man.\n\nEngl-land again is from the Hebrew word 'igl' which means bullock. England = Bullock-land. Ephraim was known as God's young bullock, the firstlings, and his fair child. \n\nDeuteronomy 33:17 (KJV) His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh. \n\nIreland was originally known as Ebernia from Abraham's forefather Eber from whence comes the Hebrew tongue <b> and t</b>he race collectively known as the Hebrews - Eber's descendants. \n\nThe Iberian peninsular also gets its name from Eber. These places were named by Zarah in his migrations who was the twin brother of Pharez who were Judah's two sons by Tamar - Saragossa in Spain takes its name from Zarah who<b>  ha<b> d</b</b>> the red thread tied to his wrist at the time of his birth -<b>  th<b> e</b</b>> Zarah Red Hand of Northern Ireland and on its flag to this day.\n\nThe Hebrides off the west of Scotland are really the Hebrew-des. \n\nThe Scots and Irish both play the bagpipes which are known to have Middle Eastern origins. \n\nThe first Christian churches planted outside of Jerusalem were in Britain in 35 AD and there is archaeological evidence to prove it. These churches were planted by Joseph of Arimathea and his small band of saints. This proves the Israelites were in Britain. British churches pre-date Antioch.\n\nCaucasians = White Israelites.\n\n [LINK] \n\n [LINK] ",

Is someone a <b> racist </b>for criticising the actions of the British government? Of course not, so let's stop this nonsense. We already know Corbyn has made enemies in Israel for criticising the Israeli government, this is merely a smear campaign.

The Arabs are a Semitic people, so why is it that Jews have a monopoly on this \"antisemitism\"?\nI think you will comfortably find that what people are REALLY sick and tired of is the constant moaning and whining about \"antisemitism\" especially when the phenomenon is not hatred of Jews per se but rather hatred of <b> racist,</b> nationalist apartheid policies pursued by the government of the entity currently known as Israel. With all this bleating, it's as if the Jews are forever the most persecuted people in the world! THEY ARE NOT.  What about the Muslims in the UK who endure verbal and physical attacks? What about the Christians who endure similar? Yes, report attacks to the proper authorities. The problem is that the \"antisemitism\" propaganda machine has got people so afraid of being labelled as anti Jewish that they bend over backwards to appease and prove the contrary! ENOUGH!",

They push for disarmament, mass third world immigration, globalist policies, but do the opposite in their country. In every western country they overwhelmingly lobby the other way. \n\nThey control the banks, they control the media, they control Hollywood and the entertainment industry, and they denigrate and blame as much as they possibly can on the native populations, particularly Europeans (White Privilege is a Jewish concept pushed by Jews claiming to be white) using all of the above. At the central bank, they print money and loan it on interest. It's the active enslavement of everyone else. They're double dealing connivers. In their holy book it says that the gentile are cattle. They teach this to their children at a young <b> age.</b> They have a long history of attaching themselves to a host<b>  nation</b>, robbing them of their wealth, eventually pissing off the host people enough for them to get kicked out (anudda shoah) and then they go on to the next country as woefully oppressed minority. They've been kicked out of hundreds of other communities throughout history, look it up. \n\nI could go for a while... Short answer is that they're smart, evil(immoral, inconsiderate, manipulative, selfish) people, and yes, everyone fucking hates them once exposed to them for long enough, and that has been the case for all of human history. Sure, there are a lot of Jews who don't fit this description, but it is true relative to other groups.",

They journeyed from Greater Scythia by way of the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Pillars of Hercules, and dwelt for a long course of time in Spain among the most savage tribes, but nowhere could they be subdued by a<b> ny ra</b>ce, however barbarous. Thence they came, twelve hundred years after the people of Israel crossed <b> the<b>  </b</b>>Red Sea, to their home in the west where they still live today.'\n\nDaniel 9:7 (KJV) O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee. \n\nBritain consists of five of the Twelve Tribes of Israel - Ephraim = England; Simeon = Scotland; Wales and Cornwall = Levi; Judah = Northern Ireland and Scotland; Dan = Southern Ireland.\n\nThe British Gaeli<b> c an</b>d Old English tongues are Hebrew in origin, this has been proven by linguistic scholars.\n\n\"The English tongue agreeth with the Hebrew a thousand times more than with the Latin.\"  \n\n- William Tyndale \u2013 multi-linguist and early translator of the English Bible.\n\nThe Saaca or Saacea (Isaac's sons = saxons) came from the lands of the Medes and Parthians where the Assyrians (Germans) placed them after taking the Northern Kingdom of Israel captive in 725 BC.\n\nThe Scythians (The tribe of Simeon - The Scots) came from the same area between the Caspian S<b> ea and</b> Black Sea and north<b>  of th</b>e Black Sea.\n\nSir Francis Drake and Elizabeth I both knew England was Israel - privately QE II also knows.\n\nJoshua 1:3 (KJV) Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses. \n\nThe Mayflower American founding fathers (the Puritans) all knew that England was Israel and planted Israel in the promised land of the New World - New England.\n\nThe word British is from the Hebrew words 'Berith' and 'Ish'. Hebrew Berith = Covenant and Hebrew Ish = man so British means Covenant Man.\n\nEngl-land again is from the Hebrew word 'igl' which means bullock. England = Bullock-land. Ephraim was known as God's young bullock, the firstlings, and his fair child. \n\nDeuteronomy 33:17 (KJV) His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh. \n\nIreland was originally known as Ebernia from Abraham's forefather Eber from whence comes the Hebrew tongue<b>  and </b>the race collectively known as the Hebrews - Eber's descendants. \n\nThe Iberian peninsular also gets its name from Eber. These places were named by Zarah in his migrations who was the twin brother of Pharez who were Judah's two sons by Tamar - Saragossa in Spain takes its name from Zarah wh<b> o h<b> a</b</b>>d the red thread tied to his wrist at the time of his birth <b> - t<b> h</b</b>>e Zarah Red Hand of Northern Ireland and on its flag to this day.\n\nThe Hebrides off the west of Scotland are really the Hebrew-des. \n\nThe Scots and Irish both play the bagpipes which are known to have Middle Eastern origins. \n\nThe first Christian churches planted outside of Jerusalem were in Britain in 35 AD and there is archaeological evidence to prove it. These churches were planted by Joseph of Arimathea and his small band of saints. This proves the Israelites were in Britain. British churches pre-date Antioch.\n\nCaucasians = White Israelites.\n\n [LINK] \n\n [LINK] ",

            "commentText": "Pre-Israel the accusations of Zionist conspiracies were paranoid and totally unfounded; whereas post-Israel - the accusations of Zionist plots have a kernel of truth to them. Jews are actively involved in a plot to annex the occupied territories, moreover they actively support the Christian Right in the US, and use the Anti Defamation League to intimidate critics of Israel into silence.\n\nThese are not conspiracy theories - they are facts. So to equate the present \nMuslim anti-Semitism with that of the anti-Semitism of the 1930s is a non-sequitur. \n\nThe latter being totally unwarranted, whereas the former surge in anti-Semitism has been self inflicted to a large extent by Zionists themselves.\n\nBut still it's wrong of Muslims - particularly young Muslims - in the Labour Party to verbally attack Jews, they should remember that not all Jews support Netanyarhu. However, such anti-Semitism is of a different order to traditional anti-Semitism. It is an anti-Semitism borne of genuine grievance. \n\nOnce the Jews gained their own state and became colonizers - it was a considerable game-changer.  The Left does not love Jews unconditionally. When the Jews act as colonizers - the Left cannot look the other way on account of the  long history of persecution against Jews\n\nThat would be akin to supporting the Boers in S Africa because Lord Kitchener once put them in concentration camps. You can't grant a country a pass for suffering past injustices.",

I'm lost for words that hating on JEWS in this country is almost \"acceptable\" whereas the oppositions to anything remotely Islamic is a taboo so massive that people hardly dare to utter the word \"Muslim.\" As a baptised Christian (though not a practising one) I believe the Jews to be the most persecuted religion in history, and as a humanitarian, I welcome them and support their success and progression. For all those left wing pro-immigration types reading, explain why Jews shouldn't be in Israel, you England SHOULD be flooded with Muslims? The bottom line is, are Jews putting home made bombs on tube trains? And Jews driving vehicles into people in packed public places? And Jews blowing up our children in music venues? Are Jews beheading our soldiers outside of the military bases??? No!!!!!!!!!!! They're simply another religion going about their faith in a peaceful manner. Respect to Jews!!",

Only last week, a French politician appeared on a news feature about the exponential rise of anti-semitism across Europe - \"We are trying to understand this\" he said, with a profound look of puzzlement. Let me enlighten them - the steep rise in anti-semitism correlates directly with the steep rise in muslims coming into Europe. And the establishment that invited islam into our lives uses mainstream media to imply that the culprits are indigenous Brits and Europeans.",

My experiences of life to date seem to point to the fact if there is some value in something then it is worth subverting the truths to hide the real agendas....and jews are no exception ....and all religions are equally guilty for this.

In colleges and universities in London, Jewish students have said they been intimidated, verbally abused and some even been spat at. I know a Rabbi who was walking down a street and a group Muslim children spit on him. The situation with the increase in the male Muslim population is getting very bad.",

I never even mentioned the name of the religion in my comment but you placed it together yourself.  You are the one who is admitting that there is a problem between Muslims and Jewish people by simply saying this.  It is important to face the problem with truth.  FYI, the Nazi's were responsible for the holocaust.  You are right that they were Germans.  Did you know that a great deal of Europeans died fighting the Nazi's to save the Jewish people?",

The kids of the 'enemy' that are being gang raped by Muslims and brutally killed during the war of Israel and Palestine? War is war if you think there is going to be happy endings and flowers for the population you are wrong. At least Israelis act in the war, they don't infiltrate kill a family and then rape the women and the child like Muslims do. You guys love to blame Israelis by acting in the war, when they are only defending themselves against a <b> race </b>and a religion that is trying to STEAL their lands. Just like Muslim are starting to do in the U.K., in Sweden, in France, in Poland ect. Have you even looked at the Muslims campaigns of them proposing themselves to take the lands of others in the name of their allah because they believe those lands are theirs by right? Gosh! Do some damn research. Israelis are not the real enemy here.",

Zionism is what people don't like and want to see abolished for one main reason, they are and always will be Israel first, not Britian, not Europe or anywhere else for that matter and that includes America hence the huge influx of refugees. They are the one's that made this happen which makes them the enemy. I'm neither left or right i simply have a mind of my own and do my own research and if someone like me can figure this out why haven't any of you who are far more intelligent than me? I can only come to one conclusion you are one of them, if im wrong feel free to respond, i'd love to hear your thoughts on why no one cares or says anything when an IDF soldier kills an unarmed child at a protest, film's it and says this is going to make a great movie then gets away with it!! Imagine if that was your child, how would you feel then? Also why doesn't Israel have to sign the nuclear treaty when every other country has to? All we hear on the news is Iran this Iran that, there's never any mention of Dimona in Israel, sound's a bit one sided to me",

People had even called News casters through CPAN\nscrutinizing them over The 5 Dancing Israels. Carl Cameron from FOX News in December of 2001 mentioned The Israeli Art Students. Supposedly, those Israeli Art Students\nthat were working in The WTC on a project called, 'The Gelatin B Thing\" were from Vienna according to The NY Times. Rebekkah Roth wrote a book about them called, Methodical Deceptions. I never read her book, but I do remember the pictures that they took of themselves while they were in The WTC. BB-18 was stamped on the side of their boxes. Mrs. Roth pointed out that BB018 comes from a company called 'Littelfuse.' Basically, they were fuse holders according to Littelfuse's website. Dr. Alan Sabrosky, a U.S. Veteran who taught at The U.S. Army War College, spoke out about those Israeli Art Students as well. Their project was supposed to be secret. Funny that The NY Times reported on their secret project.\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/18/nyregion/balcony-scene-unseen-atop-world-episode-trade-center-assumes-mythic-qualities.html\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOiCMMMeXE8\nhttps://archive.org/stream/DancingIsraelisFBIReport/fbi%20report%20section%201_djvu.txt",

The Illuminati were a dark communistic secret society bent on taking over the world from within. They were also highly known for infiltrating top levels of The Freemasons and The Vatican long ago after their founding in May of 1776, the same year our U.S. Constitution was written here in The United States. The Illuminati also had sub-objectives. One was to rob children of their poor mothers. Of course, CPS does that often. Another sub- objective was to rob people of their property. Of course, bankers do that slowly with Interest that they charge. Of course, eventually widespread famine follows Hyperinflation as taught through Economics Class through college. Ever look at The National Debt Clock Online? Would you like for my to share my \"Principles of Economics\" book from college? I can share a link to that college book. Hyperinflation is caused when a <b> nation </b>can no longer pay down the principle on The National Debt and all that a<b>  nation</b> can do is pay down partial interest on the National Debt. Prices on items increase faster and faster as money deflates in value to the point where inflation itself spirals out of control which is known as Hyperinflation. Money can become worth less than the paper it is printed on like what happened to Zimbabwe (recently), Yugoslavia (1992), Germany (1923), and is still happening in Venezuela today. Of course, another sub-objective by The Illuminati was to take control of the media in order to control the populous. Proofs of a Conspiracy was first written in 1798 but rewritten by The Americanist Classics (publisher) in 1967.",

I am well aware of this fact even though I am not an expert on this matter (nor are you). What I was asking for was a reliable source to  bolster the claim that Jews have been kicked out of 140 countries. Considering that  in Medieval Europe there was nowhere near 140 countries in existence,  I really doubt that anyone can prove that this outrageous figure is <b> nothing </b>more than a complete lie. The purpose of this lie, of course, is to make it appear that somehow the Jews were at fault for the behavior of Gentile Europe. Pathetic line of reasoning but one that many Jew haters try to hang their hat on to justify their sick hatred.",

The expulsions have happened in different time periods not just medieval Europe there were expulsions in eras before and after, and the amount of countries and kingdoms that arose in medieval Europe are FAR more than 140 of them lol. They won't be all on one map because many have fallen or risen at that point before Charlemagne even France itself was split into numerous parts. there is a similar story for Germany, Britain, Iberia, Italy, and the Nordic peninsula. Your comment is complete nonsense",

Unless you are talking only about cities and towns then I think your figure is complete nonsense.  You are correct in that Germany and Italy were not unified countries in Medieval Europe or even thereafter for a while. Even so, the figure of 140 is far too large. Unless you can cite a reliable source (not from the internet which often times is anything but reliable). Rather from a serious piece of historical scholarship by a respected historian.  Regardless, it is obvious that you are intelligent which is a rare thing to find  on you tube. Have you read any serious scholarship on the expulsion of Jews during the time period of the destruction of the second temple to the Enlightenment period (which effectively ended these expulsions). I doubt it. And ultimately what is your point? Let me guess. We Jews are somehow to blame for everything bad that has happened to us. Is that it, Boomer?",

You certainly have not proven that there were ever 140 countries in Europe (today or in the past). You might have shown, based on mere internet research, that there could have been 140 countries in the entire world during the Middle Ages (I doubt even that). But your reliance on the internet shows that you have not done any real research on this subject and that you are hardly an authority in this matter. Neither am I. But I don't pretend to be otherwise. The bottom line for me is that this is not important. Some Jew haters pretend that the expulsions (however many) were the fault of the my ancestors entirely based on the assertion that the sheer number of kingdoms/countries that Jews were expelled from proves that it must be our fault. That being said, the higher the number of kingdoms/countries claimed, the more they feel that their idiotic assertion has some basis. So they are motivated to exaggerate or even make up numbers to justify their hatred. And that is what I was trying to point out when I asserted that the 140 country claim has no serious historical basis and you have not proven otherwise.",

Either way, you are behind the curve, Israel by International Agreement have been back on their land 70 years on May 14. I will be celebrating their birthday.\nPalestinians are NOT an<b>  ethnic</b> group .The name Palestine was given by the Romans in 135 ce, but the fact that you give a land another name in an attempt to make it disappear , changes nothing",

In doing so rehashing <b> old </b>AS tropes when referencing that 5 of the 20 Tory ministers were in fact Jews. Remember that left wing group aptly called 'The Right' whose entire raison detre was to spread AS hate? A group which ultimately went on to become that well known left wing institution, The National Front. Remember Kevin Myers, a journalist for that well known left wing publication, the Sunday Times, owned by the massively left wing Rupert Murdoch, where he wrote an article expressing, \"I note that two of the best-paid women presenters in the BBC \u2013 Claudia Winkleman and Vanessa Feltz, with whose, no doubt, sterling work I am tragically unacquainted \u2013 are Jews\". Yup, that would be the same Kevin Myers who holds the exact same opinions as another massively left wing man, David Irving. I could go on and on and on. It's clearly a problem exclusive to the left, right?",

Almost all of the civil wars in Africa are a direct result of the European empires that ruled these areas, and these empires were ruled by Christians. Christians control almost every country in the world. The only time a nuclear weapon was used to harm, it was used by Christians. These aren't even the worst things that were done by Christians. So what? Just because bad things were done by Christians doesn't mean that they should be hated and expelled. With your logic, how can you blame the Muslim Brotherhood for constantly executing terror attacks against Christians? Just because people from a certain group do something doesn't mean that it's in the name of the entire (or even the majority) of the group.

If we could pull ourselves up then we would.\nAnd see, the difference is that Christians (only the Western European ones as they experienced division upon division, the Eastern Orthodox have done absolutely<b>  nothing</b> on that level and have suffered far more under the likes of the Ottomans and the Bolshevik Jews) actually acknowledge their wrongdoings, which is a huge part of how the Jews are manipulating them into destroying themselves meanwhile the Jews have no regard for the 'goyim' or for their actions towards us.\nAnd another thing, all of humankind has conquered and fought one another since time immemorial, it's no use trying to guilt-trip people over that. The Jews on the other hand like to guilt-trip whites in particular.\n\nIt's not about conspiracies. It comes naturally to them to subvert gentile societies, any conspiracies come afterwards.",

You've all been moving from <b> nation </b>to<b>  nation</b> for many years and getting kicked out each time (with only the Muslims taking you in BTW).\n\nI don't know how many of you are raised under this extremist ideology or not, however the most powerful of you are the most dangerous, and that is probably an indicator i<b> f nothin</b>g else. They censor anything that even remotely paints Jews in a negative light (wherever they can) or target those who speak out against them or the tribe, or even whites who try to make a case for the survival of their people. Heck they were quick to screech loudly about how Trump (who basically works for you people) used 'America First' as his slogan, and tried to make it out to be anti-semitic (which I now understand why). Back to my point about the danger your elites pose, moderates such as you are a shield to them, excusing their actions for no other reason than that you belong to the same tribe.\n\nDifference being that the Bible is mostly followed in terms of the New Testament, and the OT is pretty much the Torah. It's also not kept secret from anyone or watered down to conceal anything.\n\nAs I've said before, there are many reasons I never wanted the JQ to be real or to have the answer that it does. But tell me, how then can I speak in defense of your tribe when those who are rebelling against you (and those Jews who are betraying or telling the truth about you) have many facts on their side? I could bring up the good things your people have done, things that have a lot of value to me in particular, but they'd be smacked away as irrelevant in comparison to the bad. And they would be right to do so.\n\nLook, I can't say I hate Jews, nor that I like them. But whichever one of these is ultimately irrelevant in the face of what's truly going on with you all, and it's on this way that I must stay. To see what the real truth is in the end. All I know now is that you lot don't have the real truth on your side, with all the censorship, subterfuge, silencing, distortion of reality, and more. Not saying those who oppose you do either, but you all serve as an obstacle in the path to finding out what's really going on, more so than any other people on Earth. It's truly sad that you have to be the single most enigmatic group on the planet.",

The American government, Saudi Royals and Deepstate, Pakistani Deepstate and Israeli Deepstate, along with the UK deepstate planned and executed the attack on the WTC on 9/11/01; Israel is a fiefdom or a puppet state of the international elite, despite the overhwhelming power of the Israel lobby, Israeli military does not do something unless the US approves. On numerous occasions US deepstate operatives have gone against Israel, in fact Obama and his lib elit prog cognoscenti made the Iran deal and concessions to PA, this is something Zionists do not approve of, would you say that George Soros is anti-Establishment? No? then why did he attack Israel financially? why does he disapprove of the settlements and pays little to no attention to zionist causes? why is he hated by Likud and others? Im only explaining what the situation is. \n\nThe Israelis are not in charge, no one is, the US and their attack dog/ward, Israel, are aligned with NATO which is a bulwark against th Eastern powers. There is <b> nothing </b>else. \n\nNormative statements are meaningless, the material conditions, and the Elite, determine geostrategic and geopolitical outcomes always. This is an iron law. All grass roots movements are rooted in elite backing or elite squabbles. Right now Russian and Chinese are at war with the West, we're in the middle of a cold war. Trump can pretend to friendship all he wants, the interests of his friends are not Putin and Xi's interests.\n\nSelf interest rules always",

            "commentText": "The actions of Israel and powerful Zionists is not a reason to abuse Jews on the street. Right wing people have been abusing Jews forever. Left wing people need to cut it out and we need to get back on the side of love for the Jews. Most Jews don't want war in Palestine and most want a peaceful solution. It's the fault of Zionists, Islamic terrorists and the Americans that we can't have peace. Condemn violence on all sides (as Corbyn does) and work for a peaceful solution, as Corbyn did in Northern Ireland. He's the only major politician who has made efforts to stop this.\n\nAs for Zionist bankers. We don't only want to stop them but all of the powerful bankers and rich people fucking over the world. Don't simply target the Zionists and don't compliment them by calling them Jewish. Zionists are anti-Jewish in their attitudes, just as Islamic terrorists are anti-Muslim in their's.\n\nMedia need to stop using this to attack Labour too. I've got Jewish friends who are really offended by it because if you're not a moron you're aware that Labour did far more for Jews around the time of the holocaust (during and after) and it was Clement Attlee and Russia who delivered victory over the Nazis (whilst idiots credit Churchill and the USA who played a small role compared). Ever since Labour have done more. And to this day, antisemitism comes much more from Tories and antisemitism consistently rises under Tory rule. A couple of Labour MPs say bad things? They were democratically elected and until there's public pressure, it's simply undemocratic to expel them. If they're bad, then people shouldn't vote for them as MPs. I would say the same for the countless <b> racist,</b> classist,<b>  homophobic</b>, sexist, antisemitic and/or Islamophobic things Tory MPs have done. Forget a few passing comments, Zac Goldsmith ran a whole fucking campaign for the Tories on Islamophobic rhetoric. A campaign more filled with hatred than Donald Trump's or Nigel Farage's. Needless to say, in London, he lost.\n\nAll hate is hate. And the media focusing on Labour's small antisemitic problem and ignoring the mass hatred on many fronts in the Tory party is in itself, antisemitic. The Tories who stood by and di<b> d nothin</b>g and actually encouraged the holocaust all the way until now. My Jewish friends are very offended by the media using antisemitism as a political toy. And that, more than a few passing comments about Israel's Islamophob<b> ic ethn</b>ic cleansing, is more antisemitic.",

WHo would question the Africans right to get rid of the plunderer, even though we're all well aware that most Brits in Rhodesia etc were not wealthy or plundering but their leaders were, so they paid the price for what the powerful got up to, and there's not many people on earth who would defend them, even though the vast majority were innocent. See your judged always by the actions of your most powerful when born in a foreign country as the Brits and other Euros found out.",

            "commentText": "Conclusion We have seen that there are no reasons, either anthropological or historical, for considering the Jews as other than a definite, highly specialized type of humanity. From their Bedouin ancestors they have inherited certain characteristics, of which some have been retained to a notable extent unaltered to this day. Their retention of these ancestral traits has been favoured partly by the circumstances of their history as a people and partly by the original momentum possessed by the traits themselves. Among the more salient of these traits we may name:\u2014\n        (a) The non-territorial sense of <b> nationality </b>and<b>  ethnic</b> unity, which makes the Jews prone to disperse by choice and prone to suffer compulsory dispersion kindly. This trait, which has a nomad origin, also makes it difficult, if not impossible, for them ever to feel rooted in an ancestral soil as the territorial national feels.\n        (b) The inability to grasp or accept an institution of property, in which mutual obligation is implicit, in which privilege is proportionate to responsibility, and in which the contribution of the community, either present or past, has made it impossible to isolate property as a possession to be enjoyed individually, or divorced from all ties or limitations. The nomad may know of a family contribution, but not of a communal contribution, to his property, and when he packs up his tent and his household goods, and drives his flock before him to a new pasture or a fresh oasis, he can recognize obligations to no man.\n        (c) A distaste for those forms of gaining a livelihood, or of sustaining themselves and families, which involve manual or generally physical labour. The Bedouin is at bottom the antithesis of the horny-handed son of the soil, and his tastes differ accordingly.\n        (d) A capacity for hardness both to themselves and others. An individualistic existence like that of the nomad necessarily involves periods of privation, hardship and lonely struggle often against equally individualistic rivals (e) A latent tendency to a democratic and Liberal outlook, which becomes active and militant when Jews are faced with the problem of establishing themselves among a Conservative people. This democratic and Liberal tendency has two possible roots \u2014 the habit of individual freedom and of owing obedience to no man in a nomad state; and the recognition by the Jews, when they find themselves faced by a Conservative people or a people organized on aristocratic lines, of the usefulness of siding with and supporting all those elements in the land which are undermining the Conservative and aristocratic traditions, and\n        (f) A seniority over all those types of mankind which have had a relatively much shorter connexion with civilized and urban life. This has endowed the Jews with a superior shrewdness regarding all the circumstances and problems that are likely to arise in closely herded urban communities. (The psychological insight and the intelligence of the Jews may be merely other aspects of this seniority.) This trait, as we have seen, springs from the Jew's millennial association not only with civilization but also a civilization of trading and urban centres.\n        Further traits which manifest themselves as the result of the above innate tendencies, when Jews find themselves among a people more recently civilized than themselves or organized on an aristocratic, feudal, and mutualistic institution of property, are:\u2014\n        (1) A general intolerance of all the restrictions imposed on a free use of property, on a free use of business shrewdness. For instance, an intolerance of any laws or regulations which may exist against regrating, forward buying, cornering markets, concentrating large fortunes in single hands, etc., all of which practices our Tudor and Stuart sovereigns did their utmost to suppress.\n        (2) A general intolerance towards all purely hereditary titles, honours or privileges which have their root in custom, ancient usage, above all in the soil, and which cannot be bought. Hence Jewish Radicalism.\n        (3) A tendency to convert a society based on a mutualistic conception of property, and on a system of graded service with protection of the subordinate in return for his obedience, into a society in which the population is atomized, in which each man's interests and hand are against his neighbour's, and which is characterized by a bellum omnium contra omnes \u2014 in fact, modern Capitalism. (4) A general feeling of inferiority towards territorial nationals which, as the result of the phenomenon known as over-compensation, forces their natural will to ascendancy to inordinate levels when they are among territorial nationals.\n        (5) A late and ultimate tendency to meet the general break-up of Capitalism and the society built upon it \u2014 a society which necessarily proves incapable of enduring owing to the faulty foundations on which it rests \u2014 by siding with those elements which desire to hasten and consummate its break-up. The tendency of the Jew in decadent Europe may be due to his recognition of the fact that the system he has created, Capitalism, is inevitably doomed, and to his desire to secure himself a modicum of control, if not of leadership, in the new system which is Socialism or Communism. For it must be remembered that the Jew is congenitally incapable of visualizing or framing a system of gregarious life based on th<b> e ol</b>d ideas of limited property with responsibility and mutuality, and, therefore, when Capitalism fails, he can see no other alternative than Socialism or Communism.\n        Now, every one of these characteristics, far from having been modified or eradicated, have been rather confirmed and intensified by the events in the Jews' long history, and as throughout this history the Jews have been subjected to a constant process of rigorous selection by which only those who were most true to type have been able to survive, they now represent a highly specialized group of human beings, with all the limitations and all the highly developed gifts imparted to them by their unique destiny.\n        We have seen that it is not historically correct to regard any of the characteristics by which they are generally recognized as created in them by circumstances comparatively so recent as the treatment they received at the hands of the medi\u00e6val European peoples, among whom they sojourned after the Roman Dispersion.\n        We have seen, moreover, that this applies even to their indomitable desire for ascendancy, which is making them strive everywhere for the strategic positions from which modern civilized states may be directed or controlled, and to their notorious predilection in favour of trade, finance and all those occupations which, while being what is known as \"clean\", secure those who pursue them a share in the productive labour of others.\n        Having, moreover, recognized these facts and established them on what appears to be irrefutable data, the question is, what should be the attitude of the territorial nationals in any modern state to the Jews sojourning among them?\n\n\n        From the purely anthropological standpoint, it may be concluded right away that anything in the nature of mixed marriages with the Jews, particularly on the part of English people, cannot fail to introduce into pure English stocks ma<b> ny ethn</b>ic elements which are not merely foreign to the English as a people, but the absence of which from English strains constitutes one of the principal claims to the specific character of the English as a particular people in north-western Europe.\n        Mixture with the Jews through marriage must, therefore, seriously modify the English strain. And all those who any longer wish those specific elements in civilization which are commonly regarded as English, and which are but the external expression of the English type, to be retained as an essential part of the Engl<b> ish nat</b>ion will, therefore, naturally avoid mixed marriages with the Jew.\n        As a colonizing people, which has come into contact with all sorts and varieties of races and types, and kept singularly free from intermarriage with them, this, to the English, should not be a difficult form of abstention, and apart from the English peerage, there is little evidence that mixed English and Jew marriages are much in favour.\n        With regard to the attitude of the English to the Jews in social and political life, however, the position is not so simple.\n        There can be no doubt that, from the standpoint of a strictly Conservative attitude, the Jew should be precluded from too much control over our institutions and customs, because as they are not an external expression of his type, his intervention as a power over them cannot fail to modify them in an un-English way.\n        Prudence would, therefore, seem to dictate a policy of exclusion both of the Jew and his influence from all those departments of English life in which his influence may so alter the character of<b>  the na</b>tion as to make it lose all its specific qualities.",

                    "commentText": "Prudence would, therefore, seem to dictate a policy of exclusion both of the Jew and his influence from all those departments of English life in which his influence may so alter the character of the <b> nation </b>as to make it lose all its specific qualities.\n        Thus it would seem hardly needful to state, if we desire to preserve that character and those qualities, that the Jew should be excluded from all those positions in which the chance or opportunity occurs of fundamentally modifying the character and customs of the<b>  nation</b>. For, whether intentionally or not, it would seem as if the Jew could not help modifying these national features in a non-Occidental direction.\n        On the other hand, there are grave logical objections to these apparently obvious policies. (a) For instance, our data above have shown that ever since 1655 English life has undoubtedly become more and more Judaized \u2014 that is to say, that the people of this country and the life they lead have tended to approach more and more to Jewish standards or to standards under which the Jewish character flourishes.\n        Would there be any sense in now excluding th<b> e ethni</b>c Jew, when his Gentile counterpart, his Gentile pupil and slavish imitator is everywhere enthroned by his side, and in greater numbers than the Jews themselves?\n        Is there any sense in excluding the creator of a culture if you retain his values?\n        Modern English life is bristling with evidence of the victory of the Judaized Englishman and of Jewish values. What sense, then, would there be in so empty a gesture as excluding t<b> he ethn</b>ic Jew and retaining his Gentile understudy? What purpose would be served in excluding the Jew and in continuing to worship at the shrine of his idols?\n        No exclusion of the Jews from the administrative or cultural life of England, therefore, could be more than a piece of shallow, hysterical patriotism, if it did not contemplate and include the far more fundamental but infinitely more difficult task of freeing the country of its wrong values. And all bodies of Englishmen who seriously wish to recover English civilization at this stage cannot be regarded as any more than emotional and hysterical flag wavers if they do not see the compelling need of that infinitely difficult task \u2014 the task of accompanying any gesture of organized reform by a frontal attack upon the Judaized elements in their kith and kin and their own Judaized values.\n        (b) In addition to this necessary warning \u2014 the burden of which has been to some extent, though not wholly, overlooked in Germany \u2014 there is a further difficulty that requires stating, and it is a great difficulty which is peculiar to England as the head of a great empire.\n        The difficulty arises from the complicated problem of administering even by proxy a vast area such as the British Empire, in which scores of different races have to be treated as legitimate British subjects. And it is very questionable whether, at this stage, we can revert to a policy which even the Romans considered injudicious, of withholding full civic rights from <b> any eth</b>nic unit within the length and breadth of the Empire. To differentiate our policy in this matter according to what kind of people we are dealing with, and to make one adverse exception in the case of the Jews, would hardly be practicable, more particularly as we know from history that the Jews received equal rights in the colonies long before they did in England.\n        The policy of excluding the Jews from administrative influence and power, therefore, could only prove practicable if it were consistently pursued with regard to all other races and types. But whereas this might have been possible two centuries ago, it is hardly possible now.\n        The only alternative to the radical exclusion o<b> f an et</b>hnic type in an empire like ours, therefore, is a demonetization of all the current values which can definitely be classed as disruptive, decadent and destructive of what is regarded as the essential culture of England. For, just as the Jews have, by the support of values favourable to their existence ever since the seventeenth century (though really much earlier owing to influences coming from the Continent throughout the centuries following the banishment) helped to modify England and English life and made them both much more adapted to their needs and tastes, at the cost of transforming England, so it is possible by a wholesale demonetization of these values to make English life and England, and possibly even the Empire, adopt a culture and an outlook as different as chalk from cheese from those which we now see about us.\n        But such a transformation and wholesale demonetization of established values is a stupendous undertaking, and although none other offers any hope, it may be questioned whether at this stage in our history we still possess the energy, the fire and the will which alone could be adequate to carry through such a fundamental and far-reaching change.\n        If we do not, and if we ourselves cannot move towards a sounder, healthier and saner condition which will restore our ancient institutions and ancient stamina, health and self-esteem, there can be no practical solution of the problem at all. It is essential to set out with a transmutation of existing unsound and corrupt values, especially those which have Bedouinized not only our society but also our pure type. And if we wish to be practical, it is to this task that we of this generation will address ourselves with all the energy and resolution at our command.",

Although he preached new things and was not accepted by the community, Jesus was a Jew. (you will disagree with me on that but most Christians and all Jews probably would not.) Please be aware of the fact that the actions of people living in a society thousands of years ago do not reflect the mainstream opinion of Jewish people today. \nIf you are going to criticise Judaism based off quotations from religious books, you have to quote the Talmud, as it was written by Rabbis as an interpretation and is a largely accepted source of religious authority. Much of what was written in the Torah was contributed by ordinary men who do not hold religious significance who's outlook was reflective of the current culture therefore their opinions aren't really significant. \nI will also mention that there are morally questionable things in ALL of the religious books so if you are going to attack a religion based on quotes you found on a website, I hope you are holding other religions to the same standard. You also shouldn't hold everything in the Torah or the actions of Jewish people centuries ago against modern Jewish people. People interpret religion in different ways. Many Orthodox Jewish people, for example, are misogynistic and as a Jewish person I think it's gross but it's arguably part of that religion.Same with every major world religion except Sikhism.  There are  many conservative Christians who are <b> homophobic </b>and I think it's sad. I could find violence encouraged in every religious book but I will not use these things as an excuse to hate that religion as a whole or everyone who practices.",

But when real life people try to push real life narratives and agendas that could legitimately bring about real life suffering on innocent Jewish people, that I cannot morally accept and be okay with. A line needs to be drawn between normal trolls and people camouflaging under the guise of trolls but who actually want to cause harm of an<b>  ethnic</b> community or on entire races. It's easy to see what motives are behind people when they do or say things. I am in favor of exposing real antisemitism and shinning a light on thes<b> e racis</b>t scumbags. I'm against the suppression of free speech. Quite on the contrary, I think people who express openly antisemitic or maliciously implicit antisemitism should have their voices heard and shown to the public for what they are to be publicly humiliated and exposed.",

The thread asked: \"Why is Labour Anti-Semitic...?\" to which I responded (paraphrasing): that the \"Jewish Lobby\" had decided that they didn't like Jeremy Corbyn or his style of politics.  I was then attacked by a \"Hasbara Troll\" who immediately accused me of being an Anti-Semite, and must have then reported my comments - resulting in the block.  I'm 1/8 Sephardic Jew on my Mother's side.  I am no Anti-Semite.  I study online with Bnei Baruch (based in Israel) on a weekly basis at www.kabbalah.info - the issue seems to be around criticism of the \"Jewish Lobby\" (aka \"Israel Lobby\").  Either Israel is a Secular Multi-Ethnic Democratic State, or it is the Homeland of the Jews (Zionism) - and can be both, but then why am I automatically an \"Anti-Semite\" if I criticize the Human Rights abuses of the Israeli Secular State (for example)...?  My comments were in no way hateful towards Jews.  On the contrary, the hate is directed at Jeremy Corbyn by the \"Jewish Lobby\" in its continual false accusations of Anti-Semitism against the Labour Party and how Jeremy Corbyn has dealt with the issue.  Ken Livingstone simply revealed an uncomfortable truth, and he was immediately suspended.  This is a witch-hunt and attempt to curtail Freedom of Speech.  These Anti-Semitic slurs are hate crimes in themselves.  It has to stop.  People can see through it.  It doesn't do the \"Jewish Lobby\" any favours to act in this way.  I am well within my rights to criticize whomever I like in a non-threatening, reasonable and fair way.\nWhy is the Jewish Lobby Anti-Jeremy Corbyn...?",

People are so quick to vilify Isreal, is it because it's the only Jewish state that exists? They're constantly threatened by their Muslim neighbors (who are the majority!-how is that a fair fight?) with the threat of total annihilation (basically genocide). Europe and the rest of the world not only condones this behavior, but vilifies the country and the people who are being threatened. \n\nIt never fails to amaze me how quick people are to sympathize with the Palestinians (who have a track record and history of murdering and committing genocide against Jews) over the Israelis who have tried time and time again to keep the peace.",

They throw rocks ALL the time, call you a traitor, physically try to attack..If you are arab, its worse sadly for them..As for the term anti-semitic.?.Semites are both Jew and Arab <b> race.</b>..so if you are hating on arabs too, you are anti semitic!!  Go to Israel, you find young jews and arabs just want to live a normal life without interference from their respective fascist regimes.!! Thats why Netenyahu has the media focus on Jerusalem where the nutcase orthodox resides because the young jews and arabs in Tel Aviv, Haifa etc are popping pills, partying it up and generally having a great time...The Palestinian govt refuses to accept liberal arabs who join with their jewish brothers and sisters to party..hang out together...  This is because the young know religion is the culprit on all sides spreading hateful beliefs found in outdated books ...Sadly, the extreme views come from<b>  old</b> arabs and jews who live outside of Israel and Palestinian territories. As for my fellow jews in britain...harden the fuck up!!!",

They should've killed ever last greedy<b>  Yid</b>. Wasted opportunity. It's so sad!\" The only other comments\u00a0I heard were worse. I was sitting in that class suddenly in a state of shock. I never imagined such a reaction to the holocaust,\u00a0but as I looked around the class I saw every last kid was in agreement with that horrific anti-Jewish sentiment. They all hated the Jews completely and absolutely, every last one of them, it was terrifying! They were\u00a0nearly all Scottish protestants, from white and very middle-class privileged backgrounds, so the\u00a0fact that they\u00a0despised the Jews like that was\u00a0really quite a surprise. I was just so glad I wasn't Jewish!",

But everywhere the jew goes, he will be watched, he will at times be systematically stopped by becoming successful either by social pressure or other subtle forms of stopping the jew from succeeding either by the society disallowing the jew from being 'right' and always being 'wrong' even when he's right. Despite the Jew fairly and wholeheartedly trying to progress in the society. There will always be those groups of people who will try to stop the jews from gaining influence. The gentiles know about this, but now we do as well. So you better respect jews and show some sympathy instead of being so hateful and all so rejectful of jews. You can't keep on claiming the jews are there to stop you when in fact they have always been there to help, progress and contribute to YOUR society! Much respect for that. And there should be no respect for those who hates Jews and loves Hitler and the <b> old </b>days of Europe when a European<b>  Nazi</b> was shaping their countries into extremist-fascism and extremist-nazism and Anti-Immigrationism and Anti-Multiculturalism. This exact reason is why Liberals have won the peace prize throughout time. The Alt-Rights were always the violen<b> t racis</b>t, Anti-semitic feces of Europe. The Liberals were the saviours and beauties and Moral Heroes of Europe. And they will always be. No matter how you look at it, history shows the truth and the truth is as I just told you. Good day.",

He is not Jewish and he has no ties to Israel/Palestine.  Not necessarily anti Jewish, but it makes you wonder why he has a special interest in Israel, but not in say South Sudan, Tibet, the Sahara region, Turkey/Cyprus, Turkey/Kurdistan etc. Why has he devoted a huge amount of time to Israel, which the UK does not even share a border with? He has also resisted a lot of pressure to not recant his position lol\n\nIt's actually christians who think jews are magically \"better\" than they are (read Freud) and this is the heart of much of the antisemitism from the middle ages till now.  Ironically, studies into IQ proved that out of all the ethnicities, Jews actually WERE the smartest<b>  race</b>, proving that all the white supremacis<b> t eugenic</b>s was BS (this also explains why Jews were generally more successful on average).  Whites actually came third.  It was Jews, East Asians (e.g. Chinese, Koreans, Japanese etc.) and then whites lol  I think the mean difference was something like 14 IQ points, which is a gigantic difference in IQ.  This is one of the reasons why Jews have won something like a third of all the Nobel prizes despite being 0.5% of the world population and much of it won during severe descrimination in the early 20th centur.",

People such as George Soros who appear to use their wealth to manipulate world events for the benefit of the elite (e.g. Their push to get Hillary Clinton elected).\n\nWith that being said, anti-semitism is unacceptable most of the time and I know Jews who are perfectly decent people.
