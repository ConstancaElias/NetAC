Indians in America can say whatever they like because they have no sway in America.  No one cares what they say or think because they are inconsequential in terms of American culture.  Indians are not trend-setters in America and there are very few Indians leading in any major industry of the US, other than in IT and some areas of science and/or medicine.\nAdditionally, Americans do not see Indians as the \"in the middle\"<b>  race</b> in the US.  Most Americans see Latinos as the \"in the middle<b> \" rac</b>e of America.  Indians have designated themselves as \"brown people\", but Americans refer to Indians <b> as Indi</b>an.  When Americans use the term \"brown people\", they are referring to ALL people of color <b> . . Bl</b>ack, Hispa<b> nic, In</b>dian, Middle-Eastern, etc. - this term is typically used by Americans in conversations about diversity, to cover all people of color.\nI felt the need to clarify these points, but the bottom line is that vi<b> ewing r</b>acism as funny is IGNORANT!

They pool their money to buy properties where in Canada we are individualists we don't share money it takes a long time to purchase which sucks because they end up buying one selling for more then buying 2 selling 2 buying 4 selling 4 buying 8 selling 8 buying 16 and on and on.

Caste system was basically made to make people take certain responsibilities in development of the <b> nation </b>which means a man born in warrior caste will learn to become warrior since he was born, and leader caste guy will practise how to become leader since he was born. This was very effective and built the<b>  nation</b> good but on the other side they felt the lower caste was being cheated here and also not all warrior caste men wanted to become warriors and not all leaders wanted to become leaders. So basically caste system affected one's career dreams, is tha<b> t racis</b>m?? But in 1950 they banned it all. Now anyone can become anything, what they dream of. If caste system still existed in India PM Modi wouldn't have become leader in the first place because he comes from lower caste, which according to caste system he should be doing labour and not leader. But it's all gone now.",

That's what 'whites' see all of the time because their melanocytes aren't working as nature intended.\nIt's lighter than the rest of your body because of tissue damage. Your body is replacing the damaged tissue with new tissue and attempting to add color to the site. The site is new. Naturally, it will be lighter. Over time as you expose it to the elements it will darken.\nNature intended everyone's real color to be clayish or some variant. Because of the various degree of malfunctioning melanocytes or gene mutations, we have a diversity of perceived skin colors. \n\nI suggest the following:\n1)Doing research is empirical. \n2)User names promoting junk belongs to junks. \n3)Ignorance and Trolls are like husband and wife. \nGod bless you.",

That's why pale/pink people must cover their skin from the Sun. Melanoma?\nZeus, Vishnu, Quetzalcotl, Odin, Yah, God, or any other type of being is imaginary.

We can censor all we like on mass media, but only education changes opinion. To hear everyone's opinion and level of reasoning without ignorance. Without that, hate goes underground, logic goes out the window and divisions remain. Worse still, everything becomes much harder to monitor when it's out of sight and a potential ticking timebomb. Once upon a time we would encourage all reasoning, but today everyone is just yelling over each other to claim only their opinion can be right and to shut up ;)",

I never said all so that is you trying to put words in my mouth. Actually you should learn to read properly and not make false accusations. I didn't know that calling out discrimination is discrimination itself. You are so full of crap seriously. Also you mentioned that there are many mixed<b>  Indian</b> an<b> d blac</b>k relationships, well that is just a li<b> e (Indi</b>an people prefer to marry within there own communi<b> ty) noth</b>ing wrong with that but even if they did I think that marryi<b> ng a b</b>lack person would be their last option as they would be disowned by their parents and be ostracized in their commu<b> nity.

Anybody can be racists. As far as I'm concerned the only difference in the appearance between Indians and blacks is hair texture. I guess they bleach their skin too, they appear to hate their skin color. Self hate? Pathetic. Blacks come in all different shades just like the Indians. I believe both groups bleach their skin. Dear Indians, You are NOT white and you never will be. Example: my sister liked an<b>  Indian</b> guy and my parents did not approve. Dad said he did not wan<b> t blac</b>k grandkids, They sent her away to boarding school to break up their relationship, it worked. Didn't know they were obsessed with being or wanting to be white.

In other words, I'm 110% American. 2nd of all, I never said they can't communicate well in English. What I was saying that they don't know how to approach women properly and respectfully, like us Westerners. 3rd of all, now that you mention it, they don't have the best English in the world either, yet they pride themselves on being able to speak it with 100% fluency. Sure, I guess \"bobs and vagene\" is 100% fluency.",

Hence , the birth of bob vagene memes.\nWhat makes you think all Indians are unable to approach women properly ? Just by seeing some internet texts that too written by uneducated people , you think all the population goes around saying bob and vagene ? Boy , talk about stereotyping.\nAnd now the thing about fluency , by this time you should have understood that I can speak fluent English without any funny accent ( Yeah , the accent goes off If you are taught English from a young<b>  age</b> , like 4 or 5). Plus , many Indians have accent because , unlike you guys they are fluent in many languages not just English , I am myself fluent in Hindi , Marathi , English and Korean .\nThere you go :)",

That is why it is India that is created to all the Avatars Yeshua/Yeshiva, Buddha etc.. .Religions is created by man for power/greed the avatars created only knowledge of the mind,body and  soul and they never never wanted women to be treated like slaves.

The<b>  Indian</b> Queen was the first blessed virgin birth .. so shame! shame! where are the blessed statues to honor her, like God honored her. Instead of the military statue it should be her because her womb has colonized Asia and under Buddhism there was no Pakistan, Afghanistan was under India and it was a time of Peace which also paved the way for Yeshua/Yeshiva(Jesus' birth) and this is  planet Earth.",

Capitalism has largely uprooted the <b> old </b>caste system in urban India, and most<b>  Indian</b> immigrants come from these metro areas. BUT and this is a big but, caste does play a role fo<b> r India</b>n marriages in the US. My personal theory is not so much that it's caste at play perse, but the fear is that the elders in the family will not disapprove of intercaste marriage, and if you know anything abo<b> ut Indi</b>an families, elders basically dictate everything. But this is also changing. Intercaste marriages are taking place like never before in India, so its all just a matter of time.",

The only people who beleive this outrageous claim are low information voters, and the crooked politicians pandering to them for votes.\nYou're now claiming that these \"civil rights\" quacks have helped Asians? They have done <b> nothing </b>even for the<b>  black</b> community, much less Asians rofl.\nI chuckled a bit when you called them \"civil rights leaders\" in a serious tone. That label is reserved for them nowadays only in a joking/pejorative manner, you have just shown how utterly clueless you are on this topic rofl.\nMaybe you should ask actua<b> l blac</b>k Americans on how they feel about these quacks. Please do some actual research this topic, instead of copy pasting out-of-context information, probably from the first page of Google search.\nYes, comedians joke and laugh about serious issues. That's their job. I grew up watching Def Comedy Jam, which looking back now had some of the mo<b> st raci</b<b> >st bl</b>ack comedians I'd ever seen. Dave Chapelle's done many skits on the backwardness in <b> poor b</b>lack communities, eg. the \"3am In the Ghetto\" skit.\nRemember when Chris Rock, while denigrating the Oscars for lack of diversity and complaining about slavery, made racial stereotypes about east Asians being nerdy, and consumers of child labor?\nNo outrage over any of that??\n<b> Sorr</b>y hun, but no one here is gonna apologize to you or give you preferential treatment due t<b> o you</b>r race.. so feel free to take your faux outrage elsewhere :)",

It was basically the <b> Indian </b>version of feudal system of power and control through oppression and exploitation. What British merely did was wrested the top of that chain to get most of the goodies. Under the British hegemony, the former<b>  Indian</b> feudal overlords served and helped the British in this process. In other words, feudal Indians were complicit in looting other Indians and they had no moral qualms about it because they had been doing it for ages. So Indians must shut up and before demonizing British must have a good look in the mirror.\n\nBut the British presence was not bad for India. I think most of the Indians must thank the British because it was because of their presence, they got educated. While India was still lingering in middle ages, it is through the British they learned some lessons on civility and modernism. It is through the British the feudal minds of India became familiar with the modern concepts like democracy.  \n\nBritish were not in India to civilize the natives. They had their own business interests but it was with the British presence they learned a lot of things their feudal minds could not have dreamed. Gandhi and some of contemporaries got educated from London to lead India's struggle of independence. Without this education and resultin<b> g menta</b>l refinement, the Indians would have remained as rustic country bumpkins. Though British taught Indians English to make them useful as clerks, yet had they not done so, India would have remained in da<b> rk a</b>ge.\n\nTo recapitulate, the British were not worse than <b> the Ind</b>ian feudal lords, second, the Indians were hand-in-glove with British to plunder India, and third some really good things also happened to India because of British. So be grateful and thankful.",

Indians, no matter their color, are viewed with disdain and as enemies of white hegemony. You are considered in the same vein as blacks.\nAlso they would laugh at your aristocratic talk in regards to Indians, Turks, Persians, and Arabs. They view how countries have looked in the past 100 yrs, not what happened 1000 years ago. \nYou Indians should be proud not because of any connection to the the barbaric migrants who invaded Indus land ~3500 yrs ago - the so called \"aryans\" - but rather due to being derived from one of the vanguard ancient civilizations known and the Harappan civilization. This Indus Valley civilization was pre-Aryan, and used a totally different undeciphered script. They had great city planning and the world's first sewer systems. It's pretty fascinating. It was likely proto-Dravidian in nature.",

None of those is Brahmin either.

But even less educated Indians tend to prosper as motel, gas station, restaurant, or convenience store owners.\nSo yes, the Hindu migration to the US is selective. This is true, but the Hindu and Sikh migrants to the UK are not that selective. Sikh migration is especially non-selective, as many of the Sikhs came from rural villages and about 1/4th of UK Sikhs are even untouchables. Yet, if you take a look at the stats, both Hindus and SIkhs are doing really well. Sikhs are almost as socioeconomically successful as whites and the Hindus, mainly Gujaratis, are even more successful<b> . Today</b> Indian kids in the UK, mainly Sikhs and Hindus, are outperforming the whites economically and very much so academically.",

The Census gives you the option to pick between white/<b> black/</b>hispanic/Asian. Do<b>  Indian</b> Americans choose white<b> , blac</b>k or hispanic?\nClearly you're not from the US, as you have never filled one of these forms. So not only are Indians part of the \"Asian\" category, but surveys show that Indians outearn all other Asian groups, and that's why if you were to remove Indians ($100k income) from the Asian group ($72k income), the median income of Asians decreases considerably.",

Even though these people are living peacefully and rightfully together, but there is always some kind of cultural hostility among everyone. And second reason being, Indians have like literally every person of every colours. In North we have white people, whiter than the Irish itself, On east have squint eyes people, On west we have a freaking desert nomadic area,and In south we have<b>  black</b> majority. I am not making any of this, but being among so much different people and humans, Indians can't draw a line, like where i<b> s racis</b>m and where is not.",

Such wealth I have seen in this country, such high moral values, people of such calibre, that I do not think we would ever conquer this country, unless we break the very backbone of this<b>  nation</b>, which is her spiritual and cultural heritage, and, therefore, I propose that we replace he<b> r ol</b>d and ancient education system, her culture, for if the Indians think that all that is foreign and English is good and greater than their own, they will lose their self-esteem, their native self-culture and they will become what we want them, a truly dominat<b> ed nati</b>on.\" - LORD MACAULAY\n\nPLEASE RESEARCH BEFORE CRITICISING!",

And people don't discriminate on the basis of skin color. (BUT THEY DO DISCRIMINATE ON MANY OTHER THINGS LIKE<b>  ETHNICITY</b>). I'm a little dark skinned person from south asia but no one has made fun of me over that. But people do make fun of others who are VERY dark skinned than them in here. and of course if a south asian made fun of my skin color I would just laugh at it. But I don't know how I would react if a white person make fun of my color.",

Caste system is not based on <b> race,</b> as you have ponted out, MOST higher caste individuals are fair-skinned, not ALL. Maybe the oopsite is true. The lower caste families turned dark only to adapt to sunny conditions they worked in, and the higher caste was under the shade, so they kept their white skin. Stop saying \"Indians HAVE caste system\", like it's a cup of tea. Neither caste nor<b>  race</b> determines one's economic success in India, but there are a few exceptions to this rule. If you are a politician, caste has a major role to play. And as you said, yes, Bollywood does not boast of a great number of dark-skinned people. But down South, dark-skinned male actors are in great numbers.",

Your observaions about Carribean Indians may be correct, but in my experience they act very differently from real Indians, so you can't use them in your argument about real Indians anyway. \nSystemic <b> racism </b>does exist, but that doesn't help explain blacks' preference to remain subservient to white Europeans. Many blacks here will grab welfare as a way to stick it to the white man, and uses slavery to justify this. Slavery was absolutely horrible, but there is no excuse for blacks to act this way in a first world country with so much opportunity. We even have a<b>  black</b> president LOL.",

The whole village members had it. Also many australian aborignees and south east asian islanders are in this gene pool. Its called the australoid <b> race.</b> Original indians were forces to the south by invaders from persia. The M130 ancient marker proves we have this blood. North indians and Brahmins have mostly indo european genes.",

I am from the south and have blue eyes and pale skin, so much so people in the west also cannot make out that I'm not white. Yet, when I got my genes tested, it came back as completely associated with the <b> Indian </b>subcontinent with NO mixing with people from other countries whatsoever, for the past thousands of years. In spite of no mixing, my whole family is pale-skinned with blue, hazel, green and honey<b>  coloured</b> eyes. Also, one of the earliest discoveries of the genetic mutation for blue eyes was found in present day Afghanistan(which was a part o<b> f India</b>n territory in ancient times, even before Ashoka). So, some Indians having pale-skin and light eyes is not due to mixing with outsiders, it is due to a genetic mutation which occurred in Afghanistan(which was part of our Indus Valley civilization) thousands of years ago.",

Some people simply choose to close their eyes to facts.\n\nI have spoken to some liberal and educated <b> African </b>Americans.. They spoke about institutional<b>  racism</b> and lack of opportunity in US and some other countries.. Their frustration come from Indians being accepted easily in society and in business. You are more likely to see a<b> n India</b>n CEO, doctor, engineer, banker and scientist in US than<b>  a bla</b>ck one.\n\nThey try to downplay success of Indians by claiming they 'pretend to be white' and become successful.

Indians are genetically related to aborginal australians and caucasian people (Europeans, caucasus & middle eastern). Genetic studies have showed that ALL indians are a combination of these 2 groups which are called ancestral south<b>  indian</b> and ancestral nort<b> h india</b>n, respectively. Neither exist in their purest form but they have been mixed for thousands of years.   You can find this information right here  [LINK] \n\nThe idea that Indians are purely caucasian was debunked decades ago as a new classification for australian aboriginals and pacific islanders was introduced (Australoid). Indians look too different and unique to be Caucasian, it's visually clear that they are somewhere inbetween caucasian Middle easterns and Aboriginal Australians",

SUPPOSE YOU ARE BEST AS AN ARCHER AT THE <b> AGE </b>OF 20, YOU BECOME A KSHATRIYA, IF AT STUDIES, YOU BECOME BRAHMIN. NOW THE PORTUGESE CAME AND MADE THIS A FIXED SYSTEM. THIS DIDNT WORK ENTIRELY BUT WHEN THE BRITISHERS CAME THEY HAD TO BURN DOWN ALL GURUKALS, SHAKHAS, TEMPLES, AND BRIBE BRAHMINS TO NOT PREACH TO ANYONE BUT THEIR CHILDREN MAKING THEIR CHILDREN THE ONLY BRAHMINS, NO MATTER THEIR OFFSPRINGS POTENTIAL. BRITISHERS ALSO BRIBED KSHATRIYAS WHO WERE ALSO KINGS TO BECOME THEIR SUBJECTS AND FIGHT FOR THEM. ULTIMATELY, CASTE SYSTEM IS A CREATION OF PORTUGESE AND SPREAD BY THEM + OTHER WESTERN FORCES.\n\n\nTHEY DESTROYED INDIA!\n\nA QUOTE TO END WITH: \"I have traveled across the length and breadth of India and I have not seen one person who is a beggar, who is a thief.

Lets look at the caste system and general colourism in India and how the darker skinned you are and how it affects your prospects of marriage and how there is an intense dislike of people with dark skin. Mahatma Gandhi one of the patron saints of India was one of the biggest racists ever. I don't know why Matin Luther King looked up to him <b> say bl</b>ack people as inferior even though he himself lived in South Africa. Look at the <b> many In</b>dian and South Asian in general celebrities that have made all kinds of derogatory statements ag<b> ainst </b>black people Esha Gupta or Sarfraz Ahmad.

They need to stop this I mean there are brown people from other countries as well. If I ever go to USA I would never change my accent. I think I am handsome enough to be with white girls so no need to change myself. But I think people make issue of <b> race </b>too much.<b>  Race</b> means skin color. However it is a proof that religion is more sensitive tha<b> n rac</b>e. The reason we Indians don't assimilate that much into your cultures is because of o<b> ur indi</b>an religions, it <b> has noth</b>ing to do with<b>  our </b>race or skin color. Our religions are more conservative. There are many Christians in India who are completely different from the rest of the Indians despite being the<b>  same</b> race.",

They are often describes as Caucasians (the light skinned ones) bec they have the same skeletal structure. I can't believe you believe Indians are white! Mixing of whites and aboriginal ancient Indians created the light skinned Indians. They were initially dark skinned. The only thing Indians share with whites are that they have Neanderthal ancestry! \nIt's the same principle with blacks and whites. But when the child is born it's a<b>  black</b> child.
