        "postText": " Canadian workplaces are now multi-generational, with many workers trying to remain in their jobs past the age of 65. But are older workers welcome in the workplace? Is their experience still valued or are they being marginalized? Further, are they perceived to be squeezing out younger colleagues and thus breeding contempt? The Agenda examines ageism in the workplace and what management can do to foster the ongoing careers of older workers. ",
