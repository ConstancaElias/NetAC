        "postText": "The first time I saw what was claimed to be the \u2018real\u2019 world map, I almost didn\u2019t believe it was true.', 'Currently, British schools use and teach the Mercator projection map, made by Flemish cartographer Geradus Mercator in 1569.', 'This 400-year-old map was created at a time when Europe was seeking to establish dominance and Mercator\u2019s intention was navigational accuracy \u2013 with an imperialist agenda.', 'His map was literally drawn along the colonial trade routes and as a result of this bias, European countries were depicted significantly larger than they physically are.', 'For instance, Mercator exaggerated the size of Greenland, when it is in fact 14 times smaller than Africa. Indonesia has the fourth largest population in the world, yet it appears minuscule. And of course, Britain is aptly placed as the centre of the world, to appear more intimidating.', 'So, why should we care?', 'These inaccuracies have shaped a historical and geographical narrative that the northern hemisphere is superior. This has been taught to generation after generation and has ingrained what psychologists call an \u2018implicit racial attitude\u2019 \u2013 an automatic, arguably unconscious, racist response.', 'A study conducted by Harvard University, called Project Implicit, proved people\u2019s tendency to associate white faces with positive words and black faces with negative. You can take the test here for yourself.', 'We have to acknowledge the aftermath of imperialism and its subsequent xenophobia and I believe that continuing to see the world through a pro-Imperialist lens is deeply problematic.', 'We need to change the way the map is taught from a young age and promote an objective geography that is free from any bias.', 'Education has a huge impact on our world views. Kai Krause, the designer of The True Size of Africa model, refers to a survey in which American school children estimated their country to be the largest, with a population of 1-2 billion. This is clear evidence of how the education system has misled children using the Mercator map.', 'Recently, 600 schools in Boston instituted change. Instead of the Mercator map, all the schools switched to the Gall-Peters projection, which was produced in 1970. It is an \u2018equal-area\u2019 map that gives areas an accurate amount of surface area so that they are relative to each other.', 'Keele University has also pledged to de-colonise their curriculum, agreeing that the current system remains \u2018rooted in colonial and Western-centric world views.\u2019', 'Meanwhile, the map accepted by the National Geographic is the Robinson projection, which maintains the size to shape ratio of each country. To supplement the new map they suggest a classroom activity where students peel oranges and attempt to flatten it into a 2D surface, effectively illustrating how the map can be distorted.', 'There is much debate on which \u2018new\u2019 map should be used as none are without controversy, and producing a 2D image of our 3D world is always going to be inherently problematic.', 'But there is no excuse for modern classrooms not to embrace change, and I believe that the best way to do this is to reject the Mercator projection as the primary map immediately.', 'There are online resources that can be used to compare the various modern projections, encouraging students to be inquisitive, and this should be a compulsory part of the curriculum.', 'I have started a petition to bring more awareness to the issue and with enough attention, I hope we can appeal to Parliament.', 'The Mercator map was made for navigation, not classroom walls \u2013 we have to tackle the institutional racism that has been lurking in British schools for centuries.', 'Failing to combat the consequences of using this map for 400 years is ignorance at best. Why would we continue to teach something that has been wrong our whole lives?', 'To sign the petition, visit change.org.",

Considering the negativity from the comment section, it would appear that you have personally offended some people. Please don't let their insecurities and biasedness discourage you as this was a very well written and well explored article on a topic rarely considered in today's society. Hopefully soon you will get more opportunities to inform and maybe attract the attention of a more... encouraging audience!",

I don\u2019t think people who read this are truly understanding of what the article states. It\u2019s not an opinion it\u2019s a fact. The world map was created to make dominant countries look larger so they would be more intimidating. This was during a time when <b> racism </b>existed as the norm and white people had more status and privileges in society. The map was created making predominantly white countries seem larger and predominantly<b>  black</b> countries seem smaller. America is incredibly disproportionate to its actual size; America is a lot smaller in actuality. Similarly Africa is also disproportionate as it\u2019s a lot larger than depicted on th<b> e commo</b>n world map. A lot of the critism directed towards this article is very illiterate and narrow minded. If you have any form of critique on a young woman\u2019s work, how about you structure your viewpoint in a way of a debate instead of verbally attacking someone who was contacted by journalists who were impressed with her integrity and awareness of things that are more important and complex than mainstream media portrays to us. Really strong article Bex. The negative comments are just unintelligent, narrow minded, nonsensical keyboard warriors. Accept and appreciate that the generation of today are trying to make a better world for the generation of tomorrow. Also Damian Ryan please have the sincerity to just shut up. I\u2019m bored of your intimidating comments. If anything it\u2019s just absolutely embarrassing. Anyways, real good job Bex. Xx",
