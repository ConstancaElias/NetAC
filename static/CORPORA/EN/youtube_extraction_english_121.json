I have found that whenever I was constantly insecure about something, people reflected that back to me one way or another. This is why there are so many older individuals, men and women, who prosper even more at later stages in life; while others buy into feeling invisible- which is in their mind and they have confirmation bias for it as they are looking for ways that they are a victim instead of looking for solutions and the bright sides of things.",
