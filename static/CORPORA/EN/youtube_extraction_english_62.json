Other than that <b> racist </b>bullshit they put out there about Serena Williams.\n\nFeminism IS about hatred of men and women RULING,<b>  nothing</b> about equal treatment, because any real man WANTS to see women succeed. We WANT to see women get ahead. We DO wanna see women treated equally at the work place. But NO man is gonna see women as our equals, because, news flash, WE'RE NOT EQUALS!! No real man is gonna allow <b> a woma</b>n to rule over or run him. Never has been that way, and it never will be.\n\nThat stuff they said about young boys being around other boys being mandatory and having a girl there throws things off IS FUCKING TRUE!!! And every one of you know that shit is true. You white people have now made it so that being masculine is a damn BAD thing. There are so many young boys out here putting on skirts at very young ages and the<b> se du</b>mb fucks telling them that shit is okay. So many young boys out here are confused about themselves because these damn morons calling themselves parents, and dip shits like whoever the hell made this media matters video, are trying to push t<b> his<b>  </b</b>>gay agenda and spreading this \"toxic masculinity\" bullshit. Masculinity is SUPPOSED TO BE put on display. It';s something you're SUPPOSED TO BE proud of. It's something you're SUPPOSED to flaunt. And it's THE MAIN THING you are supposed to guide a boy through to become  a damn man.\n\nAnd yes, women DO love MEN...REAL MEN...That's how it's always been. But these days, white people are trying to promote these damn girly boys out here wearing their pants off their asses, arching their eyebrows, wearing women's clothing, accessories, hairdos, etc, as if THAT'S the new \"man\". And I say WHITE PEOPLE because preventing a boy's masculinity goes directly against ALL OTHER RACES ETHNICITIES' CULTURES.\n\nI'm getting some se<b> rio<b> u</b</b>>s gay agenda vibes from media matters after this video.",

There's a reason anecdotal evidence is borderline useless in data: a single person's experiences may not reflect the broader trends and movements within, say, an institution. I'm sorry you had shitty experiences with people purporting to be feminists, but those shitty people are not representative of feminism itself, which has centuries of history, involves countless thousands of people, and has historically been much more beneficial to society than detrimental, especially for women (obviously). A couple of shitheads who posse as feminists saying mean things to you on the internet is really <b> lame,</b> but those few losers don't represent the movement towards<b>  gender</b> parity, no matter how much they may claim to do so. \n\n\"Even in my industry many Ashley\\Gloria thumpers\"? What is \"your industry\"? I'm sorry, but I have no idea what an \"Ashley\\Gloria thumper\" is, unless you're referring to Ashley Crossman and Gloria Steinem? In which case I'd remind you that both of them took CIA money, some from the Dulles brothers, and some from COINTELPRO programs (although, so did Jackso<b> n Polloc</b>k, Andy Warhol, and many other prominent artists, as well as film directors, musicians, architects, writers, and pretty much anybody in a creative field) and that Steinem herself is the one we have to thank for the Bernie Bro stereotype, once infamously stating that the only reason women volunteered for his campaign was to look cool \"for their boyfriends\". Does she sound very feminist to you?\n\nLook my dude, I understand the hell of being surrounded by lib \"feminists\" who basically just want more poc women dictators and CEOs, and give not a fuck at all about the actual, urgent necessity f<b> or gend</b>er equality (which means making improvements in the material conditions of the lives of men, too) while they're simultaneously exuding embarrassing levels of smug self-righteousness. It's not fun. You're basically letting th<b> ese l</b>ame-ass normie feminist try-hards poison the entire well of feminism for you, when in reality feminism is so much older, complex, beneficial, and non-elitist than they can possibly imagine. \n\nThink about it this way: if I worked with a couple of gamers, right, who are really obnoxious, elitist, and preachy about video games, and if I don't really know all that much about video games to begin with, I'd probably be pretty inclined to think that not only are ga<b> mers </b>lame, but video games as a cultural institution is full of self-righteous gamers who are exactly like the shitty gamers I do know. Do you see how you're kind of falling into this trap?\n\nLook man, I'm not really interesting in arguing with or shitting on other people on the internet anymore, so if your goal is to actually have a good-faith discussion about your perception of feminism, and are open to hearing perspectives that don't come exclusively from the center or right wing, I'm happy to talk this over with you. Unfortunately, many people, especially on YouTube comment threads, have no interest in this and just want to call the other person an \"NPC\" or talk about racial differences in IQ tests, because phrenology is making a comeback I guess.",

                    "commentText": "@Leo's Universe I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to say. \"<b> Sex </b>Work\" actually refers to a pretty narrow set of economic occupations. If it involves<b>  sex</b>, and there is money exchanged, it'<b> s se</b>x work. Besides, how many jobs a term covers is not a point against it's legitimacy at all in any way. Think of how many jobs fall under the category of \"manual labor\" for crying out loud! The whole point of having an umbrella term lik<b> e \"s</b>ex work\" in the first place is precisely so  many different jobs and professions can fit under that umbrella term ! \n\nWhat do you mean by \"the women in the category of it think they are less whorish than another\"? Because no matter their \"degree\" of \" whorish\"-ness, all of them <b> are </b>sex workers as long as their jobs inv<b> olve</b> sex or prov<b> iding s</b>exual services in some way. As for the hypothetical prospect o<b> f so</b>me sex workers looking down o<b> n ot</b>her sex workers, this is an extremely flimsy and frankly total bullshit reason to not improve the live<b> s of</b> all sex workers. Have you considered that, perha<b> ps i</b>f all sex workers were better take<b> n ca</b>re of, sex workers wouldn't be able to look down on each other as much as they do now? You're rejecting the solution by using the problem itself as the reason why, and honestly my dude it's not making any sense to me at all. \n\nYour statement of \"Because of all that we will never move forward\" is nonsense to me, sorry. I'm not saying you're stupid or even trying to insult you at all, but this argument is just stupid, my dude. We will never move forward because some <b> mino</b>rity of sex workers is going to be arrogant t<b> owar</b>ds other sex workers ? So it's not the structural impediments of the system itself, the ghosts of Christian religious morality baked into that system from it's inception, or the fanatic Christian fundamentalists who control (more than) half of our politicians (particularly the right wing ones) who have a very vested interest (from either owning shares of, or receiving campaign\\Super PAC contributions from, private corrections industries, Bail bonds lobbies, and law enforcement groups\\unions\\lobbie<b> s) i</b>n keeping sex work criminalized, and the punishments increasingly brutal and severe, the actual problem is just snide shade being thrown?\n\nCome on, that's ridiculous and we both know it. Trying to blame the horrific condi<b> tion</b>s of labor sex workers fa<b> ce e</b>very day on sex workers isn't just the weakest conservative argument I've heard on the issue, it's so unnecessarily cruel and dismissive I honestly don't know how you could be unashamed of such a brazen display of an utter lack of compassion, humility, and basic human decency towards one another. I really hope this isn't emblematic of the rest of your beliefs, because we are all only human, and we all deserve help and a better life no matter who we are. \n\nWhat were you talking about when you said \"Along with women wanting to dictate what others do an [sic] calling everyone a victim\"? Can you provide some examples, or data, or even just some context to this statement? Because without any of that, it just looks like the tired talking points that incel\\mgtow\\pua types fall back on after their arguments about how awful women are (mostly because they won't sleep with them, but also because they want equality and their internet friendos\\daddies have been telling them how bad they and \"SJWs\" are for the last three years nonstop) get shown to be nonsense with no grounding in data, facts, or reality. Hopefully this is just stuff you've heard from bad actors taking advantage of your (probably entirely justified) feelings of alienation, disconnection, rejection, and loneliness, who have used them to try to weaponize you as their right wing (or anti-SJW, or anti-feminist, it's all the same by any other name) foot solider in the culture wars. In reality, they've taught you to cheer your own oppression by the status quo, even though it's the status quo itself which is responsible for the vast majority of your suffering. The only people actively trying to get past these failures of the status quo and free you from the ideological chains of your oppression, are the left wing, and feminists.",
