        "postText": "The pair were sat next to one another during the BBC\u2019s Local Election 2018 coverage.', 'And they squared off in spectacular style after Ms Perry demanded Mr McDonnell apologise to Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey for an anecdote told at a public meeting earlier this year which mentioned her being \u201clynched.\u201d', 'With host Huw Edwards struggling to interject, the two continued to talk over one another until Devizes MP Ms Perry eventually said: Look at this hand gesture: get back in your box, woman.', 'Visibly stung by her remarks, MP for Hayes and Harlington Mr McDonnell hit back, saying: That is completely unacceptable in a programme like this.', 'Stressing that the campaign was over, he suggested that usually on a programme like this contributor would discuss the events of the last few weeks a bit more objectively.', 'The pair were at each other\u2019s throats right from the start of the coverage, with Ms Perry accusing Mr McDonnell of rowing back on remarks suggesting his party was poised to take control of Westminster and Wandsworth.', 'She said: There is so much rowing back from John and Sadiq tonight you should enter a crew into the boat race next year.You\u2019d do brilliantly.', 'She also snapped at him when he attempted to respond to her remarks, saying: Would you like to carry on or would you like me to continue?', 'Mr McDonnell insisted: We never said it would be a wipe - out.', 'We said we wanted steady gains. I think that\u2019s what we are getting.', 'The exchanges prompted a mixed response on social media.The Labour man was not without his critics, with one contributor saying: McDonnell is completely inept and delusional, just like Jez, Abbott and Thornberry. Does anyone really think think this bunch could run the country effectively and keep us safe?', 'Another added: Well the people's chancellor just got served!', 'Well done to that minister for finally shutting him up!','However, not everybody was impressed by Ms Perry\u2019 s behaviour either.', 'One tweeted: She\u2019s a vile individual who tried to play the sexism card and failed miserably.', ' Another wrote: I'm no fan of John McDonnell but that odious harpie Claire Perry was vile and obnoxious.', 'Huw should have told her to shut up.'",
