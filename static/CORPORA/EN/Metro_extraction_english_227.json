        "postText": "\u2018God, you\u2019re so middle class,\u2019 my friend laughs when I refuse to go into Primark.', '\u2018They employed kids,\u2019 I reply. \u2018Plus there\u2019s so much synthetic fabric it\u2019s a wonder the shops don\u2019t regularly combust just from people running their hands through the rails.', '\u2018Don\u2019t get me started on the lighting or the layout either.\u2019', 'For better or worse I\u2019ve been branded middle class most of my life and it\u2019s true.', 'Both my parents come from working class backgrounds but were united in their ambition to advance socially and materially.', 'Dad left the rough part of London he grew up in at an early age to join the RAF and eventually fly planes for British Airways, at one point at the helm of Concorde.', 'Mum left her family\u2019s council house in a quiet rural village to study at Oxford and become an accomplished musician and French teacher.', 'My parents have made themselves middle class but I was born into it \u2013 the expectations, the angst, the ambition and the occasional snobbery.', 'My sister and I were sent to an all-girls private school to get on in life as much as we could, even though I could tell, from an early age, I didn\u2019t fit in with the upper class kids I was surrounded by.', 'Girls with ponies (which I was scared of despite the riding lessons my parents sent me to), trust funds and titles (neither of which I had).', 'I wasn\u2019t bullied but we all knew I wasn\u2019t one of them. I remember one school assignment that still makes me cringe \u2013 we had to talk about our family trees.', 'Almost everyone in my class was related to aristocrats, politicians, or someone famous or important.', 'Meanwhile my great grandmother, who I adored, had worked in the kitchens of the same stately homes my classmates\u2019 relatives had lived in.', 'I\u2019m not sure when I was first labelled middle class but I knew I belonged to a certain social group from around the age of eight, I think.', 'Secondary school was odd too. I asked to be sent to a state school for a change but everyone there thought I was posh. Boys mistook my shyness and confusion about them for snobbery. Girls wanted to be my friend, but many because they assumed I was rich.', 'That\u2019s the thing about being middle class \u2013 you\u2019re stuck in between.', 'You can\u2019t relax in the pub because you\u2019re waiting for someone to make fun of your accent or your drink, but you also can\u2019t relax at Henley because you might not know the right people.', 'Everyone thinks being middle class is about shopping at Waitrose, buying vintage clothes and decking your home out in Farrow & Ball, William Morris and unique objects d\u2019art from your travels.', 'And, although those things ring true for many of my middle class friends, and I\u2019d never say no to taramasalata on sourdough at the John Lewis cafe, I think it\u2019s more about other stuff.', 'To me it\u2019s about a persistent, low-level fear of never being good enough, never being enough of a success, always wanting more.', 'When you\u2019ve been raised to improve your lot \u2013 and your family\u2019s status \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of pressure.', 'You can\u2019t just get Bs, you need As. You can\u2019t just have fun in PE, you need to be captain of the netball team.', 'You can\u2019t pick just any career \u2013 it needs to be something that will impress all the distant relatives in the annual newsletter and the friends at the Christmas drinks parties.', 'When it comes to boyfriends, in the past I think my family slightly disapproved of those they saw as too working class or from the wrong part of town but now I\u2019m 36 I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019d be happy for me to marry any man at all (despite the fact I have no interest in marriage and never have).', 'As I\u2019ve grown older I\u2019ve found I care less about being labelled middle class. Having said that, I still have the ingrained anxieties about social standing synonymous with the label.', 'There\u2019s little I can do about it \u2013 because of my background, education and accent I\u2019ll never be working class and, as I have no interest in marrying a Lord or going into politics, it\u2019s unlikely I\u2019ll ever be upper class either.', 'I wish there was no class system in Britain \u2013 I believe there should be equal educational and employment opportunities for all \u2013 but I think only an idiot would deny its existence.', 'How many working class MPs are there, or upper class kids doing shifts at McDonald\u2019s?', 'I suspect my class is a strong part of my identity, probably more than I\u2019d like to admit or am conscious of day to day.', 'It not only affects where I shop, what I eat and watch but also who I socialise with, where I travel and where I work.', 'When someone\u2019s called middle class there\u2019s often a sneer about it \u2013 the term implies there\u2019s a touch of the Hyacinth Bucket about them.', 'I feel a bit embarrassed when I\u2019m called it \u2013 I assume people mean I\u2019m being stuck up, stuffy or prudish. Plus there\u2019s also the implication I\u2019m trying, but failing, to be upper class.', 'Despite this, I don\u2019t feel bad for being middle class.', 'If anything, as the years go on, I appreciate my parents\u2019 efforts more, and I take pride in trying to emulate their work ethic and ambitions.', 'That\u2019s not to say people of other classes aren\u2019t hard-working or don\u2019t want to reach the top, just that I\u2019m not ashamed to keep striving, like the true grasping, self-improvement-obsessed middle class social climber I suppose I am.",

            "commentText": "I totally relate to this. Being middle class has little to <b> nothing </b>to do with status, it's more the enviroment and culture that you are raised in. I was raised middle class and I now live in a very working class area and I stick out like a sore thumb. I am not posh or snobby, but the differences between how I was raised and how others were raised is very clear when people meet me. It's just about a different life experience. If you put a working class person in a very middle class area, they often feel out of place. The same is true the other way around. Again,<b>  nothing</b> to do with status, wealth or priviledge, nowadays, class is all about how you've been conditioned and cultured and what you are familiar with, especially in general living and leisure/social situations, sense of humour, interests etc. I am friends with people of all classes, but I still get laughed at for some of my interests as it's a world away from what some of my other friends would consider a \"normal\" weekend or interesting thing to do in their social/leisure circles, but for me, it's normal and exciting.",

Someone else I know was brought up on a council estate, left the local comprehensive aged 16 and is now a landowner.The reason that this <b> woman </b>is confusing herself is that few people fit these definitions which were defined by idiots like Karl Marx in the 19th century.",
