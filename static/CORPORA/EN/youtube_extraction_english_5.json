How many good men died fixing our fucked up world in that war. A world created by men I might add.....who built cities, roads, cars, airplanes, boats, ships, cooking utensils, ovens, weapons to hunt and kill with, agriculture, medicine, HVAC(heating and air for those who don't know)  who discovered new continents? Different languages? Stop trying to downplay men with bringing up our biological faults. Because those same traits can also be our greatest strengths. Please. Please show me a list of women's major accomplishments that have bettered mankind in the likes that compare to these things I've listed. This video is enough evidence. They get dropped off an an island and decide to have a big pow wow hug party upon arrival not even realizing how serious this shit is. Than end up getting mad at each other over anything because none of them know what they are doing. Bawling, and crying over starting a damn fire. They wig out and cry over everything Watch the men's episode now. Much different, cooler heads prevail.",
