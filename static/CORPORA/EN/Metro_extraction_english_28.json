        "postText": "Great news, women!', 'In the battle for who\u2019s doing the most housework, women are definitely winning\u2026 at the expense of having any time to themselves.', 'Women do more housework than men in 93% of British households, a study has revealed.', 'That\u2019s still the case if both partners work full-time. Working women are five times more likely than men to spend 20 or more hours a week doing housework.', 'Men, in comparison, averaged fewer than five hours per week. So women are doing around four times as much work at home than men are. Cool.', 'In the 7% of households where women don\u2019t outdo men on the cooking and cleaning front, this is because the woman earns more money.', 'But to repeat, in the majority of cases, even when the woman earns more money or has a more demanding job, she\u2019s still more likely to pick up the bulk of the household chores.', 'The team from University College London analysed data from more than 8,500 different sex couples who were interviewed as part of the UK Household Longitudinal Study.', 'They only found two small groups where men\u2019s contribution to housework was equal of more than that of their female partner\u2019s \u2013 in 6% of all couples women were the clear breadwinners, and in 1% of all couples the man didn\u2019t work and took on more than 20 hours of domestic labour.', 'Almost half of those surveyed were dual-earners, indicating that even when women work full days at the office, they begin a second shift when they reach home.', 'Professor Anne McMunn, who led the University College London study, said: \u2018These results matter because this is extra work which women are doing for free \u2013 as housework is unpaid. We don\u2019t think this is an active choice on the part of men to try to keep women down.', '\u2018But even these days it still tends to be the case that if there is something which needs doing in the home, women just do it.', '\u2018This has been described as a \u2018second shift\u2019 for women, who come home from work and start doing more in the form of household chores.\u2019', '\u2018Men still earn more than women, on average, and that gives them a little more leverage in terms of negotiating housework.', '\u2018Things are not changing as fast in the domestic sphere as we might have thought, so we need to raise awareness and think a bit more about it.\u2019', 'Time to make things a bit more equal, we reckon. But please don\u2019t make a chore chart with stickers.",
