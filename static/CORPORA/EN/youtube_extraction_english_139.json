This excerpt comes from the documentary Aging Matters by Nashville Public Television, exploring the changing face of aging and what our community faces as the baby boomer generation grows the over 65 population to unprecedented numbers.

From an early <b> age,</b> females are socialized into weak and passive roles. When they are adults, the majority are invisible to power jobs or governmental participation although a few become tokens, most often, if they inherit wealth.<b>  Ageism</b> is practiced more severely against women because men are more prepared financially in thei<b> r senio</b>r years. Also, the media and social norms generate the notion that males maintain the<b> ir s</b>ex appeal and virility in that they can produce sperm to produce offspring with younger females while women of the s<b> ame </b>age are unproductive. US President Trump married and conceived a son wi<b> th a w</b>oman that was 24 years younger than he was and maintains the most important job in government even though he is 71 <b> year</b>s old. Through history and presently, wars and crimes are commonly committed by males, who unyielding do<b> minant</b> woman and the world,<b>  at </b>any age. It's ironic that the females, who are restrained and devalued, outlive the males.",

They are naive and easy to manipulate why do you think they are being promoted so heavily they don't spare a thought for the future. You act on your emotions look around you we live in a world where feelings are more important than fact!",
