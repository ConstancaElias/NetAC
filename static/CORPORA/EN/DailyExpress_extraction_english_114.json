        "postText": "It takes a few minutes for them to settle down but when they do it is all business.', 'The trio have been gracing our screens collectively for more than 140 years as reporters, presenters and news anchors \u2013 at a time when women didn\u2019t routinely fill those roles \u2013 and between them they have two OBEs and a CBE.', 'Since 2009 they have been working together on Rip Off Britain, a BBC One show that takes pride in exposing scam artists and saving viewers money.', 'It draws audiences of almost four million in spite of its daytime slot.', 'The secret of the show\u2019s success is clearly down to its presenters, who bring an air of authority with their extensive CVs.', '\u201cWhen you have been in the business as long as we collectively have you become part of people\u2019s family structure,\u201d says Gloria, 78, who has been in broadcasting since the 1960s and anchored Good Evening Ulster throughout the 1970s and 1980s.', '\u201cI know this sounds a bit daft but in a lot of cases you become the wife they don\u2019t have or the daughter they don\u2019t have or the friends they don\u2019t have and people feel as if they can really open up because we have been there, on their screens, for a long time.\u201d', 'Having started in BBC Radio in 1972, Julia went on to present the Nine O\u2019Clock News throughout the 1980s, before moving to ITN.', 'She and Gloria met when they were both covering the Troubles in Northern Ireland at the height of the fighting. Now 70, she nods enthusiastically in agreement with Gloria, adding: \u201cThat longevity means we give confidence in our authority.', 'Viewers know that because we have all been round the block and interviewed everyone from prime ministers and princes to paupers, that actually no one is going to pull the wool over our eyes.\u201d', 'Rip Off Britain, which will turn 10 next year, still regularly tops the ratings \u2013 defying the idea that women over a certain age don\u2019t appeal to viewers.', 'In 1975 Angela became the first female to permanently anchor the national news on the BBC but aged just 50 \u2013 the same age as Davina McCall and Kylie Minogue are today \u2013 she was famously told by then director-general John Birt: \u201cYou\u2019ve had your day, you have to make way for the younger women behind you.\u201d', 'She laughs: \u201cI was sitting there thinking, \u2018Would you have said that to Michael Parkinson, or Terry Wogan?\u2019 But I\u2019m now 73 and I\u2019m still working in television \u2013 and I\u2019m not sure what John Birt is doing.\u201d', 'Ageism at the BBC hit the headlines when former Countryfile presenter Miriam O\u2019Reilly sued the corporation after she claimed she had been dropped because of her age in 2009.', 'This debate still rages but for the Rip Off team, their age is their USP \u2013 although the trio don\u2019t always agree on how important it is.', '\u201cOur age has nothing to do with what we do professionally or what we do on air,\u201d Angela insists, authoritatively.', '\u201cIt is totally irrelevant. I\u2019ve been in broadcasting for 52 years. We have all been around for ever, it is absolutely immaterial as far as the audience is concerned. They don\u2019t give a toss what it says on our birth certificates.\u201d Julia doesn\u2019t look so sure.', '\u201cI would say if we were aged 31, 32, and 33 the programme would not have the same impact, so actually we have to say that age does come into it. It creates something of the authority.', '\u201cI rather think it is one of the virtues of the programme, actually. There is a quality about it that is to do with age. It is not that it is irrelevant.\u201d', 'Gloria adds: \u201cWe have to speak as we find. We have never been out of work.', '\u201cI\u2019ve never had to look for a job in my life, therefore ageism doesn\u2019t come into it.', '\u201cYou don\u2019t think about it. You have to make certain tweaks. I mean, you know you won\u2019t be prime-time every Saturday at 8pm but you branch out and do different things.\u201d', 'Gloria has been working for more than seven decades, having started earning money as a performer at seven years old.', '\u201cI was brought up with a strong work ethic,\u201d she explains.', '\u201cI expect to work, I like work and I want to work.', '\u201cYou could call me a workaholic because I don\u2019t want to be home all the time. I love being with my husband but if I had to be there every day it would drive me nuts, honestly it would.', '\u201cWork has been an escape for me on many occasions, like when I lost Caron [her daughter, presenter Caron Keating who died of breast cancer, aged 41, in 2004]. Eventually it becomes my safe area.', '\u201cWhen everything else was like shifting sand, work was the only stable thing I could recognise. I am a bit of a workaholic and I think you are too, Angela, if I\u2019m being honest... Julia likes her holidays.\u201d', 'Julia admits: \u201cI think I\u2019m someone who needs a kick up the backside. I enjoy it but if I was to try and paint myself as a workaholic, anyone who knows me would be laughing.\u201d', 'I love being with my husband but if I had to be there every day it would drive me nuts', 'Gloria Hunniford', 'Her illustrious career would suggest otherwise.', 'Nothing has slowed her down, not even a brain tumour in the early 1990s.', 'A print, radio and television journalist, she has taken on diverse subjects from the industrial sector to the art world.', 'Yet the thing she, and her co-presenters, seem to love most is live television, which they still get to experience during the Rip Off Britain: Live spin-off.', 'So do they ever still get nervous?', '\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it nerves,\u201d Julia says.', '\u201cI think anyone who does live TV gets that adrenaline burst. For instance I have uncontrollable sneezing \u2013 I did it in bed last night, about 30 in a row.', 'It has never happened to me on air, thankfully. Something about adrenaline must stop that happening.\u201d', 'Gloria agrees: \u201cI think because we have all done live for 35 or 40 years you get so used to it. I like it, warts and all. Something is bound to go wrong but I love that.\u201d', 'With dozens of Rip Off Britain episodes each year, as well as their own projects, it\u2019s unlikely they will be off our screens any time soon, despite all being well over retirement age.', '\u201cYou\u2019re a long time dead, a long time the phone not ringing,\u201d says Angela.', '\u201cYou see so many who are isolated and lonely. I have never been either and I would not want to be.', '\u201cYou\u2019re learning something new all the time \u2013 it is keeping you alive.', '\u201cWe are an ageing population but we are also a population of people over 65 who don\u2019t want to retire. We three epitomise that now.\u201d",
