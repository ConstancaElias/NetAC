        "postText": "A Muslim filmmaker has said calls to \u2018withdraw\u2019 and \u2018ban\u2019 his hard-hitting film on Islamophobia, designed to tackle hate crime, are \u2018ironic\u2019 and \u2018bizarre\u2019.', 'The Martyrs, a four-minute film shot in west London in the wake of the Christchurch shootings, is based on three real-life Islamophobic crimes: a stabbing, an acid attack and the kicking in the stomach of a pregnant woman, leading to the death of her unborn twins.', 'The film has been made by Rizwan Wadan, who aims to use filmmaking as a medium through which to \u2018open dialogue\u2019 and show the impact of hate crimes by \u2018taking people on a journey\u2019 to highlight \u2018violence doesn\u2019t achieve anything\u2019.', 'It is set against the backdrop of the \u2018punish a Muslim day\u2019 last year, in which letters were sent to homes and businesses around the country, suggesting that people could win \u2018points\u2019 for attacking Muslims.', 'He hit out at claims that his graphic film was \u2018sensationalist\u2019 or \u2018promoting fear\u2019 after receiving criticisms from groups including Tell MAMA, a charity that records anti-Muslim hate crimes.', 'Rizwan said: \u2018The cases depicted in the film are real life incidents, if anything we\u2019ve toned down the filming by not showing the full extent of the violent attack on a Muslim lady who miscarried her twins\u2019.', 'The fimaker said the aim of hard-hitting films like the one he has made is to \u2018turn confrontations into conversations\u2019 and to get people \u2018thinking about these topics\u2019.', 'Addressing the claim that the film promotes fear he said: \u2018People are worried and scared regardless, take the attacks on mosques in New Zealand, people have been sharing the video on their phones, that\u2019s caused fear.', '\u2018Tell MAMA\u2019s statistics about a 593% increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes, some could argue that promotes fear.\u2019', 'He said his film was about \u2018telling Muslim stories from a Muslim perspective\u2019 and that film was a \u2018national treasure\u2019 through which to tell those stories and \u2018show other people our world\u2019.', 'Rizwan added that the entire message of the film was to teach \u2018against violence and hatred\u2019 and that it has received support from a broad demographic including both Muslims and non-Muslims.', 'Commenting on the idea that the film should be withdrawn or banned, he said he found it \u2018shocking and bizarre\u2019, especially since countries \u2018like Saudi Arabia lifted a ban on films last year, and now in 2019, people are asking for my film to be banned\u2019.', 'Mr Wadan said film was a key medium that he felt Muslim communities had \u2018neglected\u2019 in the fight against Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hatred, and while one of the aims of the film was to show the impact of anti-Muslim hatred from a Muslim perspective, the other was to show that film can be utilised by Muslims as a means through which to tell their own stories.', 'He added that if Muslims were \u2018annoyed and angry\u2019 at the way they are represented, then the solution is to get engaged with that medium and work with others to \u2018challenge those perceptions\u2019.', 'He also said he had made many personal sacrifices on the journey to becoming a film maker, including selling his own camera equipment worth \u00a332,500, in order to fulfil his ambition of tackling hatred and extremism through the films.', 'A spokesperson for Tell MAMA said: \u2018You can develop a film that informs, educates and puts forward the notion of how anti-Muslim hate takes place. Yet, this film has 3 aggressive plots, one of which shows a man dying and being stabbed.', '\u2018Whilst we know of 3 cases where Muslims have been killed by far-right extremists, aggressive cases do not make up the vast majority of hate crimes.', 'They added: \u2018We are also duty bound to work to ensures that fears are not exponentially increased at this time when there are divisions taking place.\u2019",
