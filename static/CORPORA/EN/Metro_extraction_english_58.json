        "postText": "A few weeks ago, after seeing yet another insanely bigoted tweet pop up on my timeline, I had the idea to create a Twitter account dedicated solely to telling misogynistic men to shut their mouths.', 'I was hesitant \u2013 concerned that by replying to them I would be, though not endorsing, amplifying their voices.', 'Plus, I was worried that telling them to shut up was not the best way to counter their ideas. Would they not just dismiss me as an overly emotional woman?', 'Research from Amnesty International found that \u2018Twitter [is] a place where violence and abuse against women is widespread and where inadequate remedies exist for those who experience such abuse\u2019.', 'And at a time when female MPs and journalists are receiving abuse every 30 seconds on Twitter, I felt like I had to do something.', 'The account was an outlet to express the frustration I felt after consistently seeing incredibly demeaning and outright offensive tweets. After all, if you can\u2019t tell an incredibly sexist man to shut the f*** up, who can you tell?', 'So I made the account, settling on the handle @bequietasswipe after I\u2019d found @shutupasshole to be taken. I quoted three tweets in quick succession, eloquently telling each of the men to \u2018shut the f*** up.\u2019', 'Immediately after the third tweet I got a notice that my account had been suspended for 12 hours for a violation of Twitter\u2019s rules. Due to the speed of the suspension, it was probably due to my account getting flagged for spam or foul language.', 'Twitter has previously admitted it does not do enough to protect people from the abuse they receive on the platform. In 2015, the then CEO Dick Costolo said: \u2018We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform\u2026 I\u2019m frankly ashamed at how poorly we\u2019ve dealt with this issue.\u2019', 'While current CEO Jack Dorsey has said this is more of a priority now, there is no doubt in my mind that more must be done.', 'For example, while my account was temporarily suspended, all the sexist ones I quoted still stand.', 'Of the tweets I replied to, one called for the restoration of the patriarchy and women having the vote stripped from them, one was ageist and sexist and another explained how the author\u2019s daughter would never be sexually assaulted because he taught her not to be a victim.', 'As shown in my case, it seems Twitter is more concerned with the strong language people are using to respond to racism, homophobia, or sexism than the actual racism, sexism, or homophobia.', 'With women fearing for their physical safety from online trolling the need to protect them cannot be overstated.', 'My account is back now but I would not be surprised if it got suspended again while these men are allowed to continue spreading their harmful ideologies.', 'I recognise that they have a right to free speech. I also recognise that this means I have the right to tell them to f*** right off.', 'I\u2019ve seen these hateful tweets since the day I joined Twitter. Before that, I saw it on Instagram or heard it from classmates at school.', 'More than a quarter of women have received abuse or harassment online at least once, and of these women, nearly half said this abuse made them fear for their safety. Over 40 per cent of them said this abuse was misogynistic and nearly 60 per cent said it came from strangers.', 'With women fearing for their physical safety from online trolling the need to protect them cannot be overstated.', 'If Twitter allows this hateful content it has no right to censor my reaction.', 'I am not threatening violence, nor am I repeatedly harassing these men. I am simply telling them, albeit with strong language, that I do not welcome their opinions. If their content is left up, I see no reason why mine should not be.', 'I posted some screenshots of the ordeal on my main account and received positive reception from my followers. It was nice to know I had support, but this feeling was almost outweighed by the disgust I felt towards the content I was seeing on these men\u2019s accounts.', 'The blatant sexism, other Twitter users agreeing in the replies, the insinuation that any man who does not fit the stereotypical picture of masculinity is a \u2018gamma male,\u2019 and any woman who disagreed with this was a \u2018feminist harpy.\u2019', 'At a time when even the President of the US, Donald Trump shows no respect for women and where women are shot and killed for rejecting men, this behaviour seems especially dangerous.', 'It comes as no surprise that the men who send these hateful messages online have been emboldened by the increasing acceptability of real-world misogyny by high profile figures.', 'It turns my stomach that anyone thinks this way, but it\u2019s worse knowing most of these men are fathers, passing down their hateful rhetoric to another generation.', 'I know I am not going to be able to change their minds. These are men that believe they could beat Serena Williams in a tennis match.', 'Knowing this, no argument of mine could convince them they are fundamentally wrong. So I simply suggest to them the one thing they could do that would be beneficial: shutting the f*** up.', 'While I don\u2019t think I\u2019m realistically going to achieve that, what I am hoping is that these men will realise that women \u2013 especially my generation \u2013 will not adhere to their ideas about what a woman should or should be.', 'Women deserve to exist in online spaces without having to worry about feeling unsafe.', 'It is time for Twitter \u2013 as well as other social media sites \u2013 to make preventing online abuse towards women a priority.",
