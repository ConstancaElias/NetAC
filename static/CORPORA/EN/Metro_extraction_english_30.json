        "postText": "Manspreading is deeply annoying.', 'But for all us irritated women on public transport, it\u2019s felt like the only way to tackle this maddening act is through deep sighs and passive-aggressive leg nudges.', 'No more \u2013 a student has come up with a proper solution to put an end to manspreading forever.', 'Laila Laurel, 23, is a student at the University of Brighton. She\u2019s just won the Belmond Award at New Designs in London for her creation: a chair that trains men to stop manspreading.', 'Laila\u2019s also made a chair to encourage women to take up more space.', 'Here\u2019s how the chairs work. The anti-manspreading chair has legs that narrow in width, forcing the sitter\u2019s legs to press into each other. The women\u2019s chair does the opposite, forcing their legs to be spread widely.', 'Each chair is made from sycamore and cherry wood, and genuinely looks visually pleasing \u2013 so it\u2019s great design for the aesthetics as well as the purpose.', 'Laila tells Metro.co.uk she was inspired by her own encounters with manspreading and other women\u2019s experiences.', '\u2018I was also hugely inspired by Laura Bates\u2019 Everyday Sexism Project where I read about the struggles and frustrations of women around the world pertaining to men infringing on their space,\u2019 Laila tells us.', '\u2018I think encouraging women to consider the way in which they move through the world or the space they take up in relation to men is powerful because it is such an intrinsic and huge issue, and yet one that perhaps is not always considered.', '\u2018I think men have a tendency to command space and require women to move for them far more than vice versa.', '\u2018In order to achieve gender equality it is imperative to consider many different aspects of sexism, and so that is why I thought it would interesting it try to explore political gendered issues around seating.\u2019', 'As with any woman speaking publicly about women\u2019s experiences in the world, Laila has been blasted with horrible messages from strangers who are angry about her designs.', '\u2018The reaction of the people that I spoke to at the show and those that sat in the chair has been brilliant and interesting, and people seem to have found them funny and engaging which is all I could have hoped for,\u2019 Laila explains. \u2018The online backlash however has been quite unpleasant.', '\u2018I have received a lot of explicit messages nearly entirely from men who seem to be under the impression I am trying to castrate them and that I hate all men \u2013 which couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u2019', 'Manspreaders of the world really don\u2019t need to worry, as there are currently no plans to roll the chairs out to all public spaces and force men to sit in them.', 'The chairs are more of a concept design, created to get a conversation going about how men and women take up space in the world.', 'Although wouldn\u2019t it be nice if every manspreader did have a go in the chair, just so they could get used to sitting in a considerate way?', 'Thankfully Laila isn\u2019t taking the backlash too seriously, and has no plans to stop sparking conversation.', '\u2018I don\u2019t take myself too seriously, because for my work I really want it to be both important and thought provoking, whilst also being engaging and funny,\u2019 Laila says. \u2018I think humour is a really interesting tool in order to tackle social issues.', '\u2018I hope the message my current and future works send is that of a young woman that is using her design practice in order to create fun, powerful and interesting work surrounding equality and feminism.\u2019",

            "commentText": "To think that women (and i don't mean all women as there is respectable behavior for each and every one of you) like this would seek for equality and still do petty acts to solidify their argument such as this one where one simply tries to do something that is biologically speaking uncomfortable for men and would generally be useless. like i get the point of it, it is supposed to represent a mark of equality but at the same time it rises women and lowers men and in general as a man i find a bit offensive but curently that isn't my point so moving on. As seen there are two types of chairs seen on the picture one that forces men to keep their legs shut together and one that forces women to do what is called \"man spreading\" (which i do not know why it is named that way as it could as easly be done by a women but men wouldn't mind as it is in their sole nature to do the same action) which i find stupid beacause there is no chair design or word in this world that will make me go out of my comfort zone and yes i repeat mine as i previously mentioned its only natural for a man to do such a thing so in no further regard i shall conclude my comment and end it on a note saying \"if you try to find equality in diffrences and not the similarities of genders then you shall not find it as it is not something that distributes specific role to a <b> gender </b>but something that is supposed to stand as a beacon of knowing your soul and body are equal to a specific person<b> /gender</b>, you are only activly worsenig society as it is with your behavior and ideology.\"",

They have been met with massive mockery online, because people with <b> common </b>sense and working brains see straight through this absolute nonsense.Even better, the internet has already found a way to bypass the chairs. Just say you identify as<b>  woman</b>. Boom! What are you going to do now?\"The designs are meant to start a conversation around women\u2019s rights to take up space in the world.\"Oh stop with the \"women's rights\" whine in 21st century Europe. Women have the exact same rights in the UK, the European mainland, the US, etc, as men. And in places where women are actually oppressed (like in Iran), these chairs won't change anything because they're just chairs and the creator is a certified moron.Oh, and as for \"manspreading\"? What about women who hug more space than is normal on public transport with all the crap they carry around? Can we do something about that?PS: it's not \"manspreading\" that is deeply annoying, it's stupid ideas like this getting rewarded and even given attention by the media that is actually annoying. It's almost as if modern \"journalists\" don't know how to do journalism anymore, and colleges have forgotten that they're places of education, not indoctrination.",
