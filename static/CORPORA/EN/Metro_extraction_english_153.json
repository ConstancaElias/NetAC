        "postText": "A piece like this usually starts with how shocked the writer is about a racist incident but I think it\u2019s time to be honest with readers and say, as a black woman, I am no longer shocked by the extent and dare I say it, the unimaginative nature of racism across the world.', 'The most recent racist nonsense stars Danny Baker who, until this morning, was a BBC Radio 5 Live DJ.', 'While some of us \u2013 especially as an expectant mother myself \u2013 were feeling elated for the royal couple on the birth of Archie (albeit ignoring a faint sense of worry for Meghan due to the harsh treatment she\u2019s received), Baker thought it would be a perfect time to tweet a picture of a monkey in a suit holding the hands of two well-dressed people.', 'Danny captioned this picture with \u2018royal baby leaves hospital\u2019 and we are all aware of which baby this picture made reference to.', 'Danny Baker insists that his tweet isn\u2019t racist because his mind isn\u2019t \u2018diseased\u2019 and I think that statement actually annoyed me more than his horrendous tweet.', 'I am bored of hearing people defending their racist actions with statements like: \u2018I\u2019m not racist because I\u2019m not a bad person\u2019.', 'Perpetuating racism doesn\u2019t require you to be a \u2018bad\u2019 person. It merely requires that your views of the world are informed by the myth you\u2019ve been socialised into from birth \u2013 that you are superior to another group of people based on race.', 'I am not shocked by Danny Baker\u2019s tweet but I am saddened by it for the same reason I was saddened by Alan Sugar\u2019s tweet about the Senegalese world cup team.', 'Both of these men are old enough (but not too old) to be able to identify the error in their ways yet they refuse to. Even in their \u2018apologies\u2019 there\u2019s a staunch refusal to acknowledge how deeply hurtful their \u2018banter\u2019 might be to those who are the subjects of it.', 'There are so many books and resources out there to explain racism in factual and humorous ways. Reni Eddo-Lodge wrote Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking To White People About Race and I created a satirical animated character called Sally in HR.', 'For those who are perplexed as to why the tweet by Danny is so offensive, it is important to address the fact that Meghan\u2019s mother is a black woman.', 'It is Archie\u2019s proximity to blackness that inspired Danny\u2019s tweet of a monkey, whether he chooses to acknowledge this or not.', 'For centuries black people have been likened to monkeys. This is why I say racism is unimaginative at times, the same tropes are used against black people time and time again.', 'Then again the dehumanising imagery must be reinforced consistently for it to have any power. Archie has been likened to a monkey because of the black ancestry he possesses. Michelle Obama was referred to as an \u2018ape in heels\u2019 while she was still first lady. For the royal baby and the former first lady to have been likened to primates just goes to show that racism doesn\u2019t disappear depending on the class you find yourself in within society.', 'What kind of racism should my child expect as an everyday person? Probably something much worse and I hate to even think about it. I am aware though, that I must be prepared for it.', 'Danny Baker\u2019s tweet supports archaic race biology whether he knows enough history to be aware of this or not. It is a stance that claims black people are biologically inferior to white people and was very popular in the 1600s. It also became the basis of many theories that other \u2018intellectuals\u2019 published, like Karl Vogt who believed black people were related to apes and thus not fully human.', 'These nonsensical \u2018scientific findings\u2019 only served to temporarily legitimise atrocities like the transatlantic slave trade, colonisation and segregation/apartheid.', 'I am glad Danny Baker has been relieved of his role as a DJ at the BBC because men like him say incredibly racist things frequently and it is explained away.', 'I think this happens because the average Brit isn\u2019t taught about the extent of atrocities the empire committed based on racism and therefore see no harm in their myopic and antiquated views.', 'To the best of my knowledge pictures of monkeys weren\u2019t posted online to welcome the births of Archie\u2019s royal cousins, George, Charlotte and Louis, so there is really no excuse for this type of behaviour.', 'The BBC made the right decision on this occasion and hopefully it will inspire people to educate themselves on why such a post is incredibly offensive.', 'Better education regarding history is necessary for us all if we are to move past disgusting behaviour such as the one exhibited by Danny Baker.', 'A baby who hasn\u2019t even had a chance to really experience the world is already stripped of his humanity because of his blackness. I want better for Archie, for my unborn child and for all our children.",

He should have put more thought into it. It's offensive in the end. Yes, the media took it and ran. Yes, they are blowing it up, but it is wrong. Wrong picture, wrong family, wrong person to post it. A joke should be obvious to everyone. If it's not then it wasn't well thought out or funny. The<b>  monkey</b>/Black people thing flows too deep. A circus isn't, so he should have used clowns or something. Anything other than a monkey",
