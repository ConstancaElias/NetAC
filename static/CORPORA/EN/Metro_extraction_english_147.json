        "postText": "Something rather interesting arose during the early days of the Conservative Party leadership contest.', 'It emerged that Michael Gove took cocaine \u2013 more than a few times, while Andrea Leadsom, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey favoured smoking pot. Ever the maverick, Rory Stewart dabbled in opium. Boris Johnson \u2013 our probable next Prime Minister \u2013 took cocaine.', 'What was largely ignored was that the only two people with no narcotic skeletons in the closets were the two people most likely to be stopped and searched for them: the two ethnic minority candidates (Sam Gyimah and Sajid Javid).', 'Sam Gyimah and Sajid Javid had to be functioning angels their entire lives to get to where they are. And it shows in their rather unexciting personalities today.', 'The societal privilege, indeed racial privilege, that permitted everyone else to dabble in drugs (and perhaps other things) and move on with their lives unscathed was out of the question for Gyimah and Javid. If they had become involved in drugs there is a much higher chance they would have ended up in prison rather than in Parliament.', 'More to the point: of everyone in the contest the most interesting test case of societal and racial privilege is Boris Johnson.', 'As we watch Boris Johnson cruise to Number 10 brushing off a drug record here and numerous other controversies there I cannot help but wonder \u2013 in light of his extensive track record of troubles \u2013 would this be imaginable if he was black?', 'Jumping straight to the conclusion: of course not. If Boris Johnson was black he would be used as conclusive proof of the validity of many vicious racist tropes.', 'Admitted drug offender Boris Johnson \u2018officially\u2019 has four children with Marina Wheeler, his second ex-wife (of 25 years) whom he recently left for a woman over two decades younger than him. A court ruling also unveiled that Johnson had an affair with a woman who gave birth to a daughter while he was married. In the same court case, it emerged that he has another child outside of his marriage.', 'I couldn\u2019t care less about Johnson\u2019s personal life but I\u2019m certain that if he was black, the mothers of his children (including his wife) would be shamed into silence and irrelevance. They would lose any form of individuality or personal achievement and would be tagged as his \u2018baby mamas\u2019 \u2013 a deeply stigmatising, delegitimising and limiting term.', 'As an example, if any black politician in the land had two children outside of his marriage, the mothers of his children would be used as tools to drag said person down. The first course of attack would be the \u2018baby mama\u2019 tag, which naturally leads to the issue of sex.', 'Black men with unconventional family arrangements \u2013 such as the American rapper Eric \u2018Eazy-E\u2019 Wright or any number of the brothers on North Sentinel Island \u2013 are freely described as \u2018sex-crazed\u2019.', 'The driving belief underlying this trope is that black men are predatory and unable to control themselves when it comes to sex, especially sex with white women. Unlike prominent black people with a similar discernible \u2018bedroom sweet tooth\u2019, Boris Johnson will never be tarred a \u2018sex-crazed buffoon\u2019. At worst he\u2019ll be seen and smiled at as a loveable rogue, a playboy.', 'Given his prominence, a black Boris Johnson would be the poster child for the absent or in-denial black father. Even though all parents struggle with parenting and fall short in one area or the other, his struggles and shortcomings would be highlighted as the blight of society and typical of black society.', 'Racist writers would write racist articles about him as a father and about his family, and when called out for their racism would simply go and find one of their professional black mates to write an article that backs up their racism, and further solidifies the trope.', 'Ironically, it\u2019s likely these articles would be for magazines and papers Boris Johnson either writes for or has edited. Papers where he was fired for making up quotes (a journalism sin the likes of Jayson Blair would never be forgiven for) and referred to gay men as \u2018tank-topped bumboys\u2019, a phrase that would have earned him Buju Banton levels of homophobic infamy if he was a black politician. He has also used his newspaper columns to champion European colonisation of parts of Africa \u2013 which, ironically, would probably have won him friends in the right circles if he was a black politician. Nothing boosts a black political career like collaborating with your own communal subjugation.', 'Success in black communities in western societies tends to be individualised, whereas failure is collectivised. For example: knife crime is often highlighted as a black issue, whereas England\u2019s black-driven recent sporting success (black people make up three per cent of the population but over half of the England men\u2019s football team starting 11) or any number of the ceiling smashers on the Black Powerlist is swiftly disassociated with black people (which helps explains the existence of a Black Powerlist).', 'Hence a black Boris Johnson\u2019s shortcomings \u2013 unfaithful husband, unconfirmed numbers of children, quack journalist, admitted drug offender, racist, homophobe, Islamophobe, Liverpoolphobe, and much more \u2013 would cast a shadow over the entire black community.', 'And the likelihood of him getting to No.10? Zero.', 'Sans omnipresent power and privilege of whiteness and wealth Boris Johnson would never be where he is right now.', 'At best, he\u2019d be seen as Lil Boosie, but with an expensive education. But as he is a white upper middle-class man: the chances are he\u2019ll soon be our own Donald Trump.', 'Nels Abbey is a media executive, writer and satirist based in London. His first book \u2018Think Like a White Man\u2019 is in all good book shops and sites now.",
