But any form of Brexit will damage our jobs, our economy and our public services, starving them of vital cash as the economy struggles along.', '\u2018The Liberal Democrats will stop Brexit and then use the \u00a350 billion Remain bonus to invest in our public services.', '\u2018Every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Brexit, build a brighter future and invest the \u00a350 billion Remain bonus in our vital public services.\u2019', 'The Lib Dems will launch their General Election campaign later today.', 'The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the Liberal Democrats forecast is reasonable.', 'However, the independent forecaster says it could not predict the overall growth rate and total money saved from remaining in the EU with any certainty.",
