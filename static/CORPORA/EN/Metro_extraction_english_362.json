        "postText": "I\u2019m going to put aside for a minute that a sitting MP made an intolerant and Islamaphobic comment, which goes against his own party\u2019s definition of British values taught in school \u2013 values that demand mutual respect for, and tolerance of, those with different faiths and beliefs and for those without faith.', 'And I\u2019ll put aside that this sitting MP made this comment in a newspaper article.', 'What I want to talk about is people, like Rowan Atkinson, defending Boris Johnson\u2019s comment as a joke.', '\u2018It\u2019s just a joke,\u2019 is something I hear a lot at the moment.', 'A joke is made at the expense of a race, or a religion, or a gender, or any identity, and when push back comes, we hear the defence, \u2018it\u2019s just a joke.\u2019', 'The right to make offensive jokes about people is now a free speech issue, with people on the right and the left of the joke, debating endlessly the right to tell jokes that might upset someone.', 'A joke is not universal. There is no rule for what we find funny. And more importantly, the joke-teller might learn more about the world by working out why someone isn\u2019t laughing instead of doubling down and defending their right to tell a joke at someone else\u2019s expense.', 'I remember watching an interview with Jerry Seinfeld, where the lack of diverse guests on his Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee show was criticised.', 'He said he had no interest in a person\u2019s race or gender, because funny\u2019s funny. I get that. It\u2019s a nice sentiment. For a perfect world.', 'In this world, though, is funny funny? What is funny? Do we all have the same sense of humour? Is there a universality to jokes? Who\u2019s laughing? More importantly, who isn\u2019t. And why?', 'I remember, a few months ago, my three year old daughter was trying to tell me what she had had for lunch that day.', 'She called a cucumber a \u2018hicumbumber\u2019, which made me laugh. I started referring to the vegetable exclusively as a hicumbumber in front of her. I thought it was wonderfully cute and hilarious.', 'I understand that humour involves power and laughing at something can sometimes strip away its power, but it can also give you a power you should not possess. It\u2019s not always just a joke, and funny is not always funny.', 'The more I said it, the more she shrank in front of me; first with her cheek tucked into her neck, then with her middle and ring fingers in her mouth, then with a twist of her knee and a whiny squeal, before running off into the corner of the room, shouting, \u2018Stop laughing at me, I don\u2019t like it.\u2019', 'I stopped referring to it as a hicumbumber immediately because in that moment, I had to interrogate why she wasn\u2019t laughing and why I was.', 'I was laughing because she had mispronounced something everyday even though she knows the word cucumber.', 'And she didn\u2019t find it funny because she\u2019s still learning to communicate and any moment of not being able to articulate what she is thinking or feeling is frustrating to her.', 'What\u2019s this got to do with Rowan Atkinson\u2019s defence of Boris\u2019 egregious comments, or when I ignore people who say \u2018it\u2019s just a joke mate, what\u2019s your problem?\u2019', 'I understand that humour involves power and laughing at something can sometimes strip away its power, but it can also give you a power you should not possess. It\u2019s not always just a joke, and funny is not always funny.', 'In Hannah Gadsby\u2019s excellent Netflix special, Nanette, she talks about roles and responsibilities when it comes to telling jokes rooted in her own life and pain.', 'Obviously, the Steve Allen adage that time plus tragedy equals comedy rings true. But Gadsby says: \u2018I have built a career out of self-deprecating humor and I don\u2019t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It\u2019s not humility, it\u2019s humiliation\u2026\u2019', 'This applies, I think, to jokes being made about people in the margins. Good humour should punch upwards, never downwards, nor sideways, further pushing people into the margins.', 'Whether Boris Johnson considers his comment a joke or not, the fact that it is being defended as such sets a dangerous precedent.', 'It makes the comment itself beyond criticism and beyond reproach, because the context around humour is still that if you don\u2019t get the joke, it\u2019s your fault, it\u2019s my free speech to say whatever I want.', 'And that is not what good humour should do. Funny is not always funny. You can tell the same joke again and again and it will get a different reaction each night.', 'Comedians doing Edinburgh Festival will know this at the moment, saying the same thing 28 nights in a row. Each time is different.', 'If comedy is universal, and funny is funny, a joke should bang every time to everyone. But funny is not always funny. And rather than looking at who\u2019s laughing, look at who isn\u2019t, and why. You might learn something.",

Why are you linking people who criticise this display of extreme conservative Islam with <b> racism?</b> An absolutely pathetic attempt at muddying the waters and scaring people away from having a perfectly valid discussion about our society. \"Sets a dangerous precedent\" lol \ud83d\ude02 Will you be pushing for blasphemy laws next?Also, by your \"Islamaphobic\" logic, should we also have the term \"scientologyphobic\" so that we can't criticise the idiology of Scientology? Propsterous and laugh-out-loud funny. I'm personally on the left, but this regressive left politics you're peddling is dishonest and shameful.",
