        "postText": "'Jeremy Corbyn said anti-Semitism  in any form  is vile and wrong  during his speech in North London on Tuesday. The Labour leader said: I just want to make this very clear. Anti - Semitism in any form is vile and wrong.It is an evil within our society.It is an evil that grew within Europe in the 1970 s and onwards, and ultimately led to the Holocaust.', 'There is no place for anti-Semitism in any shape or form or in any place whatsoever in modern Britain, and under a Labour Government it will not be tolerated in any form whatsoever.', 'I want to make that clear.And where the cases have been reported to us, in the Labour Party, we have a rapid and effective system of dealing with them.', 'And that process is constantly under review to make sure it is rapid and it is effective, and also that there is an education programme within our Party so that people can understand what happened when the Holocaust finally came about, what was the lead up to it, what were the levels of racism that led to that in the first place.', 'How was it the far - right were able to rise ? ', 'So under us we will protect places of worship, we will protect cemeteries that are under any form of abuse or attack whatsoever.', 'The comments follow Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis warning the very soul of our nation would be placed at stake if Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party wins the general election.', 'He said: During the past few years, on my travels through the UK and further afield, one concern has been expressed to me more than any other. Of course, the threats of the far right and violent jihadism never go away, but the question I am now most frequently asked is: What will become of Jews and Judaism in Britain if the Labour Party forms the next Government?', 'He said that the Jewish community has watched with incredulity as supporters of the Labour leadership have hounded parliamentarians, members and even staff out of the party for challenging anti-Jewish racism.', 'He added: The way in which the leadership has dealt with anti-Jewish racism is incompatible with the British values of which we are so proud - of dignity and respect for all people. It has left many decent Labour members both Jewish and non-Jewish, ashamed of what has transpired.', 'He concluded: It is not my place to tell any person how they should vote. I regret being in this situation at all. I simply pose the question: What will the result of this election say about the moral compass of our country? When December 12 arrives, I ask every person to vote with their conscience. Be in no doubt, the very soul of our nation is at stake.', 'Despite the Labour leader addressing anti-Semitism in his speech, Sky News political editor Beth Rigby said Mr Corbyn did not take on the Chief Rabbi\u2019s remarks directly.', 'She tweeted: Corbyn: Not taking on chief rabbi remarks directly. But says this: Anti-Semitism in any form is wrong. Under a labour govt it will not be tolerated in anyway whatsoever.', 'One Twitter user commented: Joke.', 'Another said: No one believes him.', 'A third wrote: No one trusts Corbyn.', 'On the Chief Rabbi\u2019s remarks, a Labour spokesman previously said: Jeremy Corbyn is a lifelong campaigner against anti-Semitism and has made absolutely clear it has no place in our party and society and that no one who engages in it does so in his name.', 'A Labour Government will guarantee the security of the Jewish community, defend and support the Jewish way of life, and combat rising anti-Semitism in our country and across Europe.'",
