If you<b>  nation</b> has interests that are not in the interest of others you can still support you<b> r natio</b>n.  The Poles have thier o<b> wn nati</b>on and it is thier choice if they want any other people in thier state.  You are wrong here.   People do not come before the interests of a sovere<b> ign nat</b>ion.  You want a patriotism with out a bite.  If a people threatens the stability and happiness of another then they will have to suffer not being a part of the body politic.  This is final.  If a foreigner brings thier children with them into another country then they are risking those children themselves.  Every person is not sacred.    If we were to only use your kind of patriotism then we would lay ourselves open to the interests of others to our own detrimen<b> t.   Ra</b>cism is ugly<b> , but nation</b>alism does not<b>  equal </b>racism unless some group of others threatens your state.  G<b> et it. </b> Racism is a reaction.   And the idea that the needs of the left are indelibly correct is not ture.  There are Hitler's in the world and there are Stalin's as well.  Both are equally dangerous.   Everyone the best thing is to keep to the middle and love your country fist.  The duty of a people is <b> to thie</b>r nation and the <b> duty of</b> a nation is to it's people.  That is  primary.

According to britanicca until 2008 it meant  to support industrial modernization in a <b> nation </b>and 0romote the national interest,  meaning better jobs, less crime, etc. The crime went up in 2016 before trump was elected and it barely dropped in 2015 when Obama inspired BLM and blacks were attacking whites. According to the FBI crime dropped among whites but<b>  black</b> o<b> n blac</b>k crime and suicides increased.  Maxine waters called for violence in 2017 and most of all hate cromes were directed at whites, especially Jewish people.  So Democrats have become more violent and are marginalizing the right, exactly as Hitler did to the Jews.",

Rather than recognizing their own failures and abuses, including censorship, political suppression and political violence, leftists choose to mischaracterize their opposition as extremists, when most of their opposition merely seeks to preserve the cohesiveness and classical liberal values of post-WW2 Western Civilization.  When the left points with alarm at the marginalized fringe far right, they only lose more credibility.",

Whereas patriotism and<b> \u00a0nationalism</b>\u00a0may represent temperate\u00a0pride, chauvinism is\u00a0intemperate.

            "commentText": "I was with you until you used Poland as an example of the evils of <b> nationalism.</b>  Wanting to protect your country and national identity from hostile invaders does NOT make you a far-right nationalist.  Poles have the same right as Palestinians, Japanese, or Kenyans to protect themselves from external threats.  Poland, like most of Eastern Europe, has endured<b>  imperialist</b> aggression from various Islamic powers over the course of the last millennium, especially the Ottomans.  The regressive, post-leftist worldview wrongly assumes that all Europeans are eternal oppressors, and all non-Europeans, especially Muslims, are eternal victims.  In reality, Europe has more often been on the defence against the totalitarian, expansionist ambitions of Muslim nations.  The Crusades only began after centuries of unchecked Islamic conquest that swallowed up the majority of Roman ('Byzantine', if you're historically illiterate) land, including the entirety of the Iberian Peninsula.   While Western Europe has been free of serious Islamist threats since 1492, it has been a perpetual danger to the continent's Eastern region, with people alive today who were born when the Ottoman flag flew over Greek, Armenian, Magyar, and Slavic nations.",

With Polish growth at 4% per annum, a 20% increase in the oil market would take over 20 years!!!! In normal western countries, politicians who let this happen would be destroyed, in poland, a politician who allowed this was elected president of the European Union(with the support of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel-in Poland, everyone knows that he is a German puppet , his party was built for German money transferred by their secret services(under the sanction of court sentences, one of the founders of this party testified about these facts :)\nSHOW ME  ONE WEST TELEVISION WHICH BY INFORMING ABOUT THIS !!!!???? WHERE IS THE WESTERN FREEDOM OF SPEECH ????\nHowever, the most important thing is Polish coal. Polish ground contains 80% of all European Union carbon .With coal gasification technique Poland can supply the EU for gas for the next 200 - 300 years!!!!\nAND THIS IS THE MAIN REASON FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF POLISH REPUTATION ON THE INTERNATIONAL  POLITICS ARENA .\n\nmotto : you want to explain, follow the money, not your feelings.......",

            "commentText": "American <b> Nationalism </b>cloaks the issue: the preponderance of under-educated White men living in the Rust Belt who have a bleak economic outlook. And who can blame them? This is not going away. These White men end up cozying up to Nativism as a cure-all for their economic insecurities, blaming minorities and immigrants for the loss of manufacturing jobs. These White men do not recognize that the corporate playbook of outsourcing quality manufacturing jobs is the culprit. Corporate profits have conspired to eliminate these cushy jobs. And the government has had its hand in this as well, with trade agreements, such as NAFTA, that make outsourcing a boon for outsourced labor. What is also being ignored is that high paying careers that require a degree are also being outsourced. \n\nNow the question is, where will this lead? War, as we saw in WWII? Not likely. The only time we'll have war is if it more profitable to wage war than to maintain economic stability. Corporations run the western world. And only war that can occur while maintaining economic stability can occur. \n\nWar with China? No, they are the cheap labor force of the West. War with NK? Yes, it could happen because this would not destabilize the West. War with China over Taiwan? No, because Taiwan is part of the economic system War in the Middle East? Yes, because as long as oil is still flowing (through whatever hands) the economies of the world's economic leaders will continue to prosper. \n\nProblems for Poland? Yes, because corporate and banking interests are no strangers to Jewish leaders. Anti-Muslim sentiment? This will not hurt the<b>  Nationalism</b> because Muslims are marginalized people. \n\nThe real harm to a society comes in the form of failing to recognize the true cause of economic insecurity.",

They should be embarrassed for their public display of stupidity.\n\nMen can first attest the use of the word <b> nationalism </b>to 1844 meaning 'devotion to one's country.' By 1892, men began using the word to mean 'doctrine advocating nationalization of a country's industry.' In short, the word became a synonym for socialism in industrial countries, hence the expression 'nationalized industry.'\n\nThe word the dopey makers of this video should use is chauvinism. Chauvinism means \n'exaggerated,<b>  blind</b<b> > nationalis</b>m; patriotism degenerated into a vice.' The word came into use in 1840.",

As a land which was occupied by both National Socialists and Marxists, it is quite understandable that they would actively seek to assert their own sovereignty and to ensure that outside influences do not occupy their land again the way it once was.\n\nThe ruling class is pissed that people across the planet seek to secede from the global empire and assert their own autonomous independent communities which is exactly why videos like this were created in the first place.",

Not bring your culture that you left because into our country to change our culture to fit your ways. That's not how it works. But politicians try to force it to work anyways.\n\nIn basic from my point of view; If your country cant help its own people, then why bring more people in that your going to give more money to that you don't have.  Your country should have no right to help anyone if they cant help the people that already live in their own borders.",

The average man today obtains his sense of identity from his belonging to a<b>  nation</b>, rather than from his being a \"Son of Man.\" His objectivity, that is, his reason, is warped by this fixation. He judges the \"stranger\" with different criteria than the members of his own clan. His feelings toward the stranger are equally warped. Those who are not \"familiar\" by bonds of blood and soil (expressed <b> a commo</b>n language, customs, food, song, etc.) are looked upon with suspicion, and paranoid delusions about them can spring up at the slightest provocation. This incestuous fixation not only poisons the relationship of the individual to the stranger, but to the members of his own clan and to himself. The person who has not freed himself from the ties to blood and soil is not yet fully born as a human being; his capacity for love and reason are crippled; he does not experience himself nor his fellow man in their-and his own-human reality<b> .\n\nNationali</b>sm is our form of incest, is our idolatry, is our insanity.

Nazism is NOT \"right wing\" at all in America, and here is how.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is the American scale, which is a measurement of government power, more left, less right.\r\n\r\nThe Second one was used by the French, during their sick revolution; but it's measured by culture rather than by power. It places \"original culture\" (the monarchy) on the right, and the \"deviant culture\", (the attempt at a republic), on the left. All of Europe uses this scale.\r\n\r\nBy the former scale, ALL forms of socialism; Communism, (Russia), National Socialism, (Germany), and Fascism, (Italy and Spain), as well as any other oligarchy/monarchy that can possibly exist, is considered Left-wing. The Republic we were founded as, would be considered right-wing.\r\n\r\nOn the latter scale, the French one, Communism and Nazism are opposites because of what happens to the host-country's culture; Communism tends to destroy the native culture, and Nazism aims to both preserve it and strengthen it.\r\n\r\nCommunism can't work in America, because it's policies are unconstitutional. Whereas Nazism simply can't exist at all in America, because it's a PARADOX. \r\nNazism, like Communism, places us under the power of an oligarchy, but unfortunately for it, America's culture is based on the concept of FREEDOM, so how can Nazism fulfill it's policy of preserving-and-strengthening America's culture?",

If you'd go by dictionary obvisuly even synonyms have something to differ from each other the problem is not a language one here. This entire<b>  Nationalism</b> vs Anti<b> - Nationalis</b>m debate is political and every party/side has it's own definition of the terms which they manipulate easily for their own benefits.\nI belong to India and here I am seeing how leftists liberal communists parties are using this debate that nationalists are not only rightwingers. Though it's clear that leftists and liberal communists are never fond <b> of nationali</b>sm and pro - government/state/ democratic establishment, they want a totalirian government which controls everything. However in India they blame the current government to be the same and argue <b> the national</b>ism of  rightwingers by twisting the debate of Patriotism as per their convenience.\nP.S. I know i haven't elaborated very well maybe because my writing skills aren't that good. I have lot to say in this regard but time falls short for me.\nthanks.",

And when they leave, the natives are often too savage to maintain any of the stuff the white man gave them.\nThis is objectively true.

They don't even deserve the recognition they get.  Please present me with evidence of these attacks on Muslims by Poles is happening.  Polish news is not something we get over here.  I take it from your name, that you are from Germany?\nI can imagine letting people into my country that have been through war as a civilian or fighter, considering the vast majority of these migrants are military aged males.  Some with ISIS sympathetic views.  I can also imagine my empathy being a selfish characteristic and how I want to view myself in a mad world and proclaiming myself the moral victor while at the expense of my countrymens' lives.  I can imagine the murder and rape rates going up and my own country having more no-go zones.  A country that my ancestors fought and died for and I'm no longer able to be in certain places.  I can see the abolition of freedom of expression in favor for these migrants that break the laws of the land and live on our tax dollars to appease politicians and become a voting body for a political party and anyone opposing them will be labele<b> d racis</b><b> t, Na</b>zi, xenophobe, etc.\nI can sympathize for people's situations, but not when they force themselves onto me.  It is not my duty to do anything to mitigate human suffering in destabilized parts of the world.  I would if it actually helped but humanitarian aid does very little as it proposes to do.  We have donated billions to each, Sierre Leone, Sudan, Somalia, Gome, and what was the end goal been from the likes<b>  of<b>  </b</b>>Red Cross?  To lessen human suffering by anyway they can.  Billions in aid to famine victims to feed them, house them, give them prosthetics.  But what does it matter when they starve to death anyways, are shot and killed, or sold into prostitution?  The reality us aid prolongs the issues because most of humanitarian aid goes to the assailants.  Warlords, generals, presidents, even humanitarian workers.
