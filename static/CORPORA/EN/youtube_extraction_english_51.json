            "commentText": "This is an accurate portrayal of men. You should look at media from the 1950's, they all mock womanhood and motherhood with subordination and inferiority. It was <b> common </b>to portray a woman's housework as easy and useless compared to a man's office job. And wives were depicted as being stupid and mindless in comparison to their husbands. Women's place in the family was portrayed as being in servitude to their husbands, they were given all of the manual labor in the home and work caring for kids while the husband came home to reap the rewards and perks of his wife's labor. For some reason, it was only his castle and it was only his kids and husbands were entitled the right to make all of the family decisions in a way that benefitted his whims. A woman's mind was never valued, she was just the maid in the family. \n\n\nIt looks like men whin and complain when they see it done to them in media, but they had no problem when it was done to women. I see many men act in the ways this video describes. This is especially true in fundamentalist Christian homes where a wife is to eat up and worship even her husband's farts.",

What's strange about you mentioning that is you're the one complaining about how bad men have it because of ads whilst complaining that people are mentioning ads instead of oppressed females in the Middle East.\n\nAlso, why should I mention Justin Bieber? As a feminist, I mainly focus on women's issues. I'm not OK with the fact that Justin B's nudes were leaked but I'm not really sure what you're getting at.

Advertisements make huge implications, assumptions, generalizations- and are perpetuating many modern stereotypes. Advertising, especial on television is psychological manipulation. One reason why I have never in my adult life owned a television is not because I myself feel affected by the pull to buy products I don't want or need- I am insightful enough to know that a majority of products being sold are harmful to those that use them, the environment, and the people that produced them -but because it makes me nauseous to watch this garbage that millions of other people are digesting on a daily basis. ...And for everyone who thinks \"Oh how the tables have turned, we USED to demean women and NOW we're demeaning men!\" I found this video after finding a Top 10 Most Sexist Commercials, this title included \"Of all time\" but was instantly introduced as the the Top 10 of the 50s and 60s. So I tried to find a modern comparison, but other than this video, when you search sexist commercials it almost instantly becomes \"Sexiest Commercials\" ...I am thoroughly disgusted by how many sexy commercial compilations have been made and shared through this website... May humanity realize that we are more than our appearance, what we buy, and there is a universe of depth to life when you create time for more than shallow, lustful entertainments. Peace.",

The comparison you made about the civil rights movement and feminism is true. However I'd compare you more to the radical movements, I think the <b> black </b>panther was one, rather than the movement as a whole.\nAs for the inferiority vs superiority argument. I think you have misunderstood something about human biology. Simply put, evolution has selected the stronger males and the more passive females because it promotes survival better when there is specialization. Hence why men were superior to women long ago, hence why social norms exist. While I agree that social norms need to be understood. I don't think disbelieving in the biological difference is a good thing. While men are superior in biology, women have more power in social standards and pull in government. Simple proof is that even though men can be victims of domestic abuse, women simply can say that it is sexist to let them have a domestic abuse shelter and<b>  poof</b>, there goes their chances.\nThe societal norms have them men are supposed to protect women and never harm them, however women are not held to that norm. In fact men are ridiculed for following the norms and not protecting himself against an abusive girlfriend or wife.\nFeminists say they are for equality, but when they will deny male victims some sense of security, you're either left wonder how the hell that is equality or you're a bigot. Now I'd respectfully like to pass the microphone to anyone who'd either like to defend my statement or criticize it because unlike feminists, my pain and suffering doesn't hold me back and actually makes me stronger and more independent.\nas a last note, feminists saying that everything is against women is making them feel weaker than they are and, in fact, making them inferior to men just so some can make profits off of these women's dependency.",

You always hear about breast cancer and spreading awareness but prostate which effects similar numbers but instead of females it effects males and compared to breast cancer to coverage is a very very small amount. Also I see these so called feminists wanting equality mentioning the pay gap which is only becaus<b> e woma</b>n and men go into different fields and like 93% of on site deaths are by men cause women tend to not wanna work dangerous jobs. Also the male suicide rate is much higher than females and I think its because there is more pressure on men that is overlooked. The whole grow up and be a man and not cry where as its OK for women to do it which is a big reason why the rates are so different. I want real equality both sides and although I only mentioned the male negatives its because it severely overshadowed by female negatives and lot of times females that believe they are so oprressed just because they have a few problems and wanna censor everything. In equality you either have it all or its not equality. Also domestic violence ignored for males compared to females and there is victim blaming on both sides but I can bet on average males abused would be treated poorly by society more commonly than females and not given support live females would be given and also in rape. I think a lot of women in USA actually are so convinced they have it worse its considered factual now without mentioning negative sides of being a man how divorce courts favors women suicide men way more likely to get killed also to kill. Maybe since men have to go through more shit and put up with more and if they cry or try to say the have had enough a lot of times will be told \"grow up and be a man\" and could have negative effects on a lot of peopl<b> e. Nobo</b>dy would take mans problems as seriously as females based on the past. How often do you see or hear about male rights groups compared to female ones on TV or discussing female problems as much as males? Violence on men is brushed aside where as female violence harbors hate towards the violator in a lot of people.",

                    "commentText": "@G4nst4Ch33se\u00a0Men do face prejudice and a lack of resources for rape and abuse, that's true and it desperately needs to be addressed. I understand why men typically aren't allowed into women's shelter, however because many abusers will pretend to be victims so they can harm their partners all over again.\u00a0\n\nAs for accusations of rape not believed (either victim, abuser, or innocent) that happens to women, too, and more often. It's a statistical fact that women are raped more often than men and that most don't report it because they know they either won't be believed or will be told they brought it on themselves. Trust me, I know this first hand from my own experience that women are rarely believed about <b> sexual </b>assault. That fact doesn't lessen the suffering of men, however. Rather than pointing fingers why don't you organize a shelter or support network for abused/assaulted men?\n\nMy statement still stands that women are more persecuted, though. 1 in every 6 women are sexually assaulted and they occur literally every 2 minutes. Women are paid only 78 cents for every dollar a man makes. If, that is, they are hired in the first place since men of equal education and experience are twice has likely to be hired.\u00a0\n\nWomen are also treated more as<b>  sexual</b> objects and taught that our entire self worth is tied up in how attractive we are to others. Advertisements, media, and society bombard us about how ugly we are, how we are getting older, and that we need to struggle to match ourselves to models of beauty that are unattainable. Women in comics and video games for example are either an object stolen from their owner, an object to be used, or an object of decoration. Ditto in movies.\u00a0\n\nNeed I go on? I have <b> a frea</b>k ton more evidence. But that still shouldn't be the point. Feminism is about equality for EVERYONE. Women are on the shorter end of the stick but that doesn't mean men shouldn't get help too. How about you help us rather than demonizing women? I don't blame men as a whole for wrongs I've suffered, so why do you blame women?",

The reason he did not want to have a daughter was that a daughter can actually destroy a family. If every family only had a daughter and she gets married, it's the end of that family's journey. She will lose the family's name and possibly not even care about what she's done. Its not sexist. It's also why some families have only children, as sons. If they are lucky enough to get a son, he will be able to carry on the family's name.\n\nNow about the whole rape conversation in the reply section.\nIt's true. Sometimes when a man gets raped the people always say,\"SHE'S A <b> WOMAN!</b> SHE CANNOT RAPE MEN, AND WHY?\" One little word of a<b>  woman</b> and he's off to court, and probably to end up in prison to his death of one of the other inmates.The thing is that society treats them as \"precious\" things. The war, for instance. Sending off innocent men to their end, while th<b> e woma</b>n has a cup of tea. Bill Cosby incident, he was famous, he gets away with it sometimes. But if she was lying,they do that in two seconds. \"OFF TO JAIL, COSBY!\" \u00a0Sometimes it happens.\n\nDivorce situations:\nT<b> he wom</b>an breaks up with the man over HER result. Going out with another man is unreasonable.\n<b> The wo</b>man then takes the money of the man - that's why some of my friends are incredibly rich -<b>  the w</b>oman just marries - starts getting dodgy with someone else - Off with the man's money it goes!

Would you want the data to be equal meaning somebody with 2 years experience a female in an office job make $2 more an hour than a male with 4 years experience in the same position just to even the stats? The stats will never be equal because people on average expect the man to pay the bigger bills. Men and women prefer different job types and that leads to the pay gap.

If she interferes in a fight to the death between two men by trying to save her husband she is to have her hand cut off, if her husband dies and he has unmarried brothers she has no choice but to marry one and let him impregnate her, If a man rapes her he is to either marry her or pay a dowry, daughters can be sold into marriage or forced to marry the men they work for, if you conquer a people in battle it's okay to rape the women and slaughter the children so long as you do it in the name of god. She is also not allowed to speak in church, teach, or argue with her husband or he has the right to put her in her place. A few times in the bible women are raped to death (sometimes also dismembered) to send a message.\n\nAs for children, if God asks you're supposed to knife your kid to death on an alter, daughters can be sold or won through conquest or reward, daughters are given up to be raped to death to save the hides of men several times. God himself killed thousands of male children in Exodus, He also killed all of Job's children in a debt with the devil that Job would still remain faithful.",

And I feel like obviously the people making these adverts are trying to make women in general feel like they have some power but they are going about it the wrong way. In turn it's both misogynistic and misandric; stating that the <b> woman'</b>s job is to cook, clean and serve, whilst the mans is to order and recieve. I mean why do you think most chefs happen to be male even though people always tell women to 'get back to the kitchen'. It's because people think a<b>  woman</b>'s role in life is to be submissive and serve. Standard fucked u<b> p gende</b>r roles really. It's kinda funny though how people don't care that the world is run on male, white and straight bias ect, and they pick out these few ads that are most likely scripted and directed and approved by men in the\nFirst place, considering the majority of the worlds media businesses and any others are made up from and run by men. If you look deeper into why these ads were thought of in ther first place, and if you literally put<b>  a wom</b>an in any scenario be it working in a business or being a government official, <b> the wo</b>man will be treated am seen differently. People don't even realise that they do it either, and sometimes even I don't until I think to myself 'if this person were male, would I be judging them the same way?'. I mean If you just look at how Hillary Clinton is being portrayed and attacked... She may not be a good president, an that's okay to say that, but most of the arguments I've heard about her are based on the fact that she has a vagina, and not a penis...",

A lot of prominent feminists and large modern feminist movements that i have seen are ridiculous. They seem to often have an agenda that seems more like submission to women than equal rights. I can give you examples if you want. you will say \"well that's not the definition\" your're right. What i and clashy are talking about are people who call themselves feminists and think maybe they're doing it for equality",
