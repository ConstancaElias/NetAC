        "postText": "The government said it has sent the EU a \u2018series of confidential technical non-papers\u2019 outlining its ideas for Brexit.', 'It comes after Boris Johnson was accused by EU leaders of \u2018pretending\u2019 to negotiate a new Brexit deal while not actually producing anything to negotiate with.', 'A spokeswoman for the government said it will submit formal written solutions \u2018when we are ready\u2019 rather than meeting an \u2018artificial deadline\u2019.', 'She added: \u2018We have been having detailed discussions with the commission\u2019s taskforce 50 in recent weeks.', '\u2018We have now shared in written form a series of confidential technical non-papers which reflect the ideas the UK has been putting forward.', '\u2018We will table formal written solutions when we are ready, not according to an artificial deadline, and when the EU is clear that it will engage constructively on them as a replacement for the backstop.\u2019', 'Yesterday, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michele Barnier told the PM to stop \u2018pretending\u2019 to negotiate a deal and actually do it.', 'He told EU lawmakers that it is \u2018not enough\u2019 for Mr Johnson to keep repeating that he does not like the backstop without producing any proposals to replace it.', 'And European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker warned that no progress could be made until the UK submitted \u2018formal written proposals\u2019.', 'Today the commission confirmed it had received \u2018documents\u2019 from the UK government and will be having \u2018discussions\u2019 as a result.', 'A spokeswoman said: \u2018With regards to written proposals, I can confirm that we have received documents from the UK and, on this basis,', '\u2018We will have technical discussions today and tomorrow on some aspects of customs, manufactured goods and sanitary and phytosanitary rules.\u2019', 'The discussions will take place at a \u2018political level\u2019 tomorrow when Mr Barnier meets with Brexit secretary Steve Barclay, the spokeswoman added.', 'Giving a speech in Madrid, Mr Barclay today said the government needs a year to come up with a replacement to the Irish backstop idea \u2013 but it still wants to leave on 31 October.', 'The cabinet minister said the EU has set Britain a test it \u2018cannot meet\u2019 with its demands for a backstop replacement.', 'Mr Barclay said: \u2018We are told the UK must provide legally operative text by the 31 October, yet the alternative to the backstop is not necessary until the end of the Implementation Period in December 2020.', '\u2018And this will be shaped by the future relationship \u2013 which is still to be determined.', '\u2018In short, why risk crystallising an undesirable result this November, when both sides can work together until December 2020.\u2019', 'He added: \u2018The EU risks continuing to insist on a test that the UK cannot meet and that the UK Parliament has rejected three times.\u2019",
