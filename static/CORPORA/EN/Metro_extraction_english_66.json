        "postText": "Jamelia has provoked anger after suggesting that people over the age of 75 shouldn\u2019t have a vote.', 'In the wake of the Brexit chaos, the singer said those who won\u2019t be around to see the consequences of their ballot should not have a say.', 'Her words were met with widespread condemnation, including fellow Remainers who said democracy should be open to all.', 'Speaking on the Jeremy Vine show to a pensioner, named only as Pat, Jamelia began by telling the caller not to get offended.', 'She then added: \u2018I think that you\u2019re completely capable of being of sound mind. I think you are capable of making a vote.', '\u2018I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that you have a vote when you\u2019re not going to experience the consequences of that vote.', '\u2018And you\u2019ve had 50-60 years old voting.\u2019', 'Pat was less than impressed and replied: \u2018Why can I not, with my own conscience, vote for what I believe in?\u2019', 'After the show, viewers and Twitter uses rounded on Jamelia, pointing out that being young was no guarantee of surviving to see the consequences of the vote.', 'They said people who have worked and paid taxes should continue to have a say while many politicians voting in Westminster were over this arbitrary age limit.', 'PMason74 said: \u2018People of 75 have lived through various types of governments and a few recessions. Why not stop under 21s or people that have never worked or students that have never paid tax?\u2019', 'Spectrumsarebeautiful added: \u2018Jamelia\u2019s view seems to be \u201cif you don\u2019t agree with what I think, you should lose your vote.\u2019', 'Poppet said: \u2018This segment left me feeling cold and slightly nauseous. To speak of elders as second class citizens and state \u201cdon\u2019t be offended\u201d your opinion doesn\u2019t count anymore is discriminatory.\u2019', 'While Alan S added: \u2018So, youthful ignorance beats the wisdom of age and experience? You think people with limited life left are thinking about themselves and not their families who will be living on. You are at the very best, delusional.\u2019', 'Rebecca Green said: \u2018So, with that theory, should anyone with a terminal or prolonged illness be denied the vote Jamelia even if they are in their 20s?\u2019', 'Official figures for the Brexit vote put the number of Leave votes at 17,410,742 \u2013 51.89%. This is compared to 16,141,241 to stay \u2013 48.11%.', 'However, there was a clear generational split and \u2013 if Jamelia\u2019s ban on older voters was ever implemented \u2013 it could well have been a different result.', 'The under 25s were twice as likely to vote Remain (71%) compared to the over 65s (36%).', 'The 25-49 year old group narrowly voted Remain (54%) compared to 40% of the 50-64 year old category.', 'By the time the UK leaves the EU on March 29, there will be another 2,000,000 more young people eligible to vote.', 'Based on the demographic change, the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) recently estimated a 52%-48% vote for Remain in 2021 and 54%-46% by 2026.', 'However, even anti-Brexit youth pressure group Our Future, Our Choice disagreed with Jamelia.', 'Co-founder Lara Spirit told Metro.co.uk: \u2018We\u2019re strong believers in democracy. We think everyone should have a vote, including over 75s.', '\u2018While there is a generational divide, particularly on Brexit, it\u2019s not the case that anyone\u2019s vote or voice should matter less than anyone else\u2019s.\u2019",

Plenty of people over 75 still work, or pay taxes on pensions.3. Students, those who have always been on benefits do not pay taxes, but get a vote?4. Anyone can die, while more and more love well beyond 75.Crawl back under your bridge, or maybe do something more interesting to claw back your fame.",

One discriminates against people who have contributed all their life - one discriminates against those who have contributed little or<b>  nothing</b>.Bet I can guess which one the PC brigade claim is \"free speech\" and which one is xenophobic/racist etc etc.On a different tack, perhaps the votin<b> g ag</b>e should be raised to at least 25 - so that there is at least a remote chance that young people have had to time to forget the biased indoctrination from their teachers and tutors - and have at least had a chance to learn the BASICS of politics.",
