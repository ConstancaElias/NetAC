            "commentText": "Black hybrids like aliens police don't care!\n\nLatest answer\n\n<b> Black,</b><b>  black</b> second generation<b> , blac</b>k bastard must all get out of China!  With the reform and opening up, the overall progress of the countr<b> y, bla</b>ck people who want to make money and have a place of stability come to our country. Th<b> ese bl</b>ack people have never returned to their hometown to serve their hometown, build their own country, and build the concept of Africa. They only know that they go to places that are easy to live in, seek personal interests in stable places, reside in o<b> ther et</b>hnic groups. China has the fastest development, China is open, China and Africa are friendly, Chinese women are beautiful and free, etc. Let <b> these </b>black people stay away from their hometown and try every means to seek to settle in China!  In Guangzhou alone, the num<b> ber of A</b>frican blacks, whether legally or illegally, is at least 300,000, of which more than 20,000 are legal immigrants and the rest are all illegal immigrants or visa e<b> xpired</b>. Black males account for more than 90% and are increasing at a rate of 30%-40% every year like viruses. Even now they are living in China.  One in ten Guangzhou p<b> eople </b>is black. This is a tragic phenomenon. It is a certa<b> inty t</b>hat black people will becom<b> e the 5</b>7th ethnic group of <b> the Chi</b><b> nese n</b>ation. Black people flock to bars and karaoke bars at night and harass women indiscriminately on the campus streets. Unmarried or married, basically, at least 60% of Guangzhou's women have bee<b> n hara</b>ssed by black people. Gua<b> ngzho</b>u's mixed-race population has increased significantly. There have been many co<b> nfl<b> ict<b> s</b</b</b>>> <b> betwee</b>n yel<b> low a</b>nd black mixed-race blacks on campus.  T<b> he pa</b>rasitic surname race is a current liability of any country. Former US President Nixon also used words similar to<b>  Despa</b>irs to describe <b> black pe</b>ople. They are African-Americans, have no great civilization, have no great scientists, and the crime rate is 7-8 times higher than that of white people. They will only use their super-strong ability to mix with local women to obtain the <b> right of abo</b>de or their nationalit<b> y to pa</b>rasitic with this nation. Maybe they can play basketball, sing and rap and then play with your women at ease. Eating your family's food is not the same for our<b>  famil</b>y. Especially those black people who are active in our media need to be banned!  However, in China, there should <b> never </b>be a large num<b> ber of </b>black people. If the ethnic origin of the Han people is really polluted by chimpanzees, the Qin and Han masters cry to death, the Tang and Song gifted scholars cry to death, the three great generals cry to death, the four great beauties cry to death, Zhuge Liang cry to death, the Pan An Song Yu cry to death, the Tang and Song eight people cry to death, the Qin Huai eight Yan cry to death, the Ran Min cry to d<b> eath, </b>the low quality of the black<b>  peop</b>le. Look at the national race * * in France and England, it is because some countries in Western Europe ignored the restrictions on foreign immigration and the punishment for smuggling, and are now quickly occup<b> ied by</b> the rapidly reproducing black people and Arabs. Now Britain and France regret it too late!  A<b> nd bl</b>acks are recognized as the race with the worst quality. In m<b> any co</b>untries, the crime rate in black communities is the highest and most chaotic. Half of the pris<b> ons in</b> <b> Guangz</b>hou and Dongguan are black.  Black people occupied France, and former<b>  roman</b>tic city is now banlieue 13!  Black people occupied Haiti and the richest region in the western hemisphere became the poores<b> t regi</b>on in the western hemisphere.  Black people have occupied South Africa. In the past, bright pearl was praised as rainbow country and b<b> ecame </b>the AIDS capital of the world.  Black people have occupied Detroit, and the once beautiful automobile city has become th<b> e crim</b>e capital of the United States.  Black people have occupied Rhodesia, which is now the region with the highest inflation in the world!  From the perspective of the civilization process, backward civilizations are always eliminated. Civilized countries in Asia and Europe always survive through constant wars and competitions to <b> create</b> a prosperous world civilization. Black people rely on civilization parasitism instead of changing their own progress.  The most important thing is the irreversi<b> bility</b> of low IQ after mixing blood with black people!  Tens of thousands of years of evolutionary history have been comp<b> lete</b>ly retrograded to<b>  the </b>barbaric animal age only by the mixed race of blacks. This is really an unprecedented retrogression of civilization and even brings disaster of extinction to civilization itself.",

It just takes loads of paperwork if you are \"born in a former French colony\" or born to a parent born in a former French colony, to get your \"papers\" of Fren<b> ch nationali</b>ty. It takes like 8 months (even though it's automatic) and everything backlogs in Nantes. These so called \"unwanted immigrants\" are not, NOT-FRENCH. Now if you're talking about the ones from, I don't know, Mars, or the former ENGLISH colonies, then that's different....I mean, people are all up in arms about France getting full of, say, Syrian immigrants - well Syria was part of the French Empire until about 1941. There'd still be loads of people born in Syria since then who had a parent born there when it was still \"French.\" That's not an \"ille<b> gal immigr</b>ant,\" it's a French person, if they had all their papers sorted in the aforementioned manner either before coming or soon after.",

But there's a lot a lot of <b> racism </b>is France and it's very institutionalized. And there's an omerta about talking about<b>  racism</b>. When you talked about it 5 years ago you were considered paranoid. Now it's changing because of documentaries, and police brutality. You have to consider that in France racial statistics are illegal. It's historical they don't want you to stir the pot of one of the biggest colonizer country in the world. I was born and raised in Paris, I've been with people of all races all social status and I can say that french elite people have an aversion fo<b> r blac</b>k people.

What is wrong with seeing if other countries are dealing with the same issues or have found a better way to deal with those issues. There are not a lot of images in the American media of lives of blacks in European countries. So people are curious about access to jobs, housing, education and if it is better in Europe.\n\nMany<b>  African</b> Americans have great jobs, education, and nice homes in America but that is not the image that is put out in the media.  Sometimes when someone ask abou<b> t racis</b>m, they just want to know if they will be treated in a hostile way before investing in a plane ticket. If someone asked me a leading question about America I would answer them and suggest they not project their biases without facts.",

I just want to add that a white person who has<b>  only </b>one black friend doesn't mean that this person is using this friend as an alibi. <b> Yes yo</b>u're black, yes I'm white, yes he/she is Asian, yes he/she is Arabian, yes we speak different languages, yes we are from different countries with different histories and cultures, so what ?! We are humans right ?! And yes, humanity is infiltrated by the stupidity of the fear and the hate of the unknown and the difference, but it can be defeated and that starts when we identify ourselfs not just as an origin but beyond that.",

It was so confusing to me living in Congo being around Congolese people that considered themselves french it is even more ridiculous as they try to imitate the french in everything they do which is one of the primary reason a lot of these french colonies in Africa are far behind east Africa.

In France, we assume that al<b> l blac</b>k french are africans and n<b> ot afric</b>an descents. It creates that feeling t<b> hat bl</b>ack=foreigners, allowing them to ignore the political issue <b> that </b>race is. There has<b>  been </b>black people on the French territory for 300 years (eventhough that territory greatly diminished). You would conceed that after 300 hundread years, we're not really foreigners.\n\nIn France, talking<b>  abou</b>t race i<b> s being</b> racist; irony: we can't ta<b> lk ab</b>out race issues. It has become taboo. Instead of that, we talk about \"immigrants\" and \"the ghetto youth\". Ignoring at the same time that the poorest part of the popu<b> lation</b> is black and arabe, that most of our con<b> victed</b> are black and arabe, th<b> at by </b>being black or arabe you will be less pay, have a harder time finding a job and etc and etc.\n\nAnd because we are a less violent country than the USA (certainly because of gun control and our police control), our cops are just not as violent as yours. That doesn't stop them fr<b> om har</b>assing black mens(ID controls is all that they can do, thank god!).\n\nFinally, the way we're dealing <b> with Is</b>lam is racist. But this point is just too long and complex. Some french feminist are talking about it, you should check them out; by being muslim women, they are more entitled to it.",

Really? Why are Africans and Arabs making so much effort to get into Europe? Why are Africans stuffing themselves into leaky boats and risking their lives to cross the sea just for a chance to live in France? Does anyone see Europeans going in the other direction?\n\nThey do it because Europe is a better place to live.

If you knew a little about world cultures then my name might have been a clue. \n\nBut those people fleeing Africa in those leaky boats are doing so because other Africans are running around with machetes and guns killing people for being of other <b> ethnic </b>groups or other religions. They are not running away from the French. They are running to France for protection and security; because it is the French and other Europeans who are willing to help them, not other<b>  African</b> countries.\n\nThere are many Africans who want to go to France or other European countries because they want their kids to grow up in civilised countries where they do not have to be afraid all the time. They want their kids to have a stable home and a good education. They know they can find that in France. \n\nThat is why Africans migrate to France and French people do not migrate to Africa. And if the cult of Islamic savages you seem to admire were to prevail over Europe, then Africans would no longer have any safe harbour to seek refuge. But it won't. Because it is already reaching a tipping point white European countries beginning to close their borders. And when they do that, your cult of semi-literate stone-age, inbreds will be powerless. If ISIS does manage to begin the all out holy war it says it wants with Europe. Then that war will end with the Middle East in flames, Muslims being deported en-masse from Europe and Africa once again isolated. \n\nISIS are not a military force in any way comparable to France or Britain or Germany. They are good at terrorising and murdering innocent people. But they already fell apart within days when confronted with Russian forces. Putin has already proved what a paper tiger ISIS is. He just doesn't care that much because Islamic murder squads are not active in Russia right now. Hollande or Merkel or May could likewise wipe out ISIS with one signature. None of them will do it because they don't have the political will; but Merkel will be gone next year and Hollande the following one. And the mood in France and Germany is hardening rapidly.",

We will never abandon it.\"\n\nThe French colonised nearly all of his empire anyway. They brought the rule of law, modern technologies of all kinds, and principles of French enlightenment and they banned slavery outright. A little further North, the British were doing the same. That is why so many smaller tribes along the so called slave coasts of west Africa supported the Europeans when they arrived.\n\nAnd yes the Moors made great advances in some areas, particularly mathematics. So too did the Egyptians. They were great empires in their own times. \n\nThe Moors conquered much of Southern Europe at one point, stealing that which did not belong to them. The Zulus of Southern Africa also built an empire on the bones of their own people and slaughtered and enslaved all around them.\n\nBut you see conquest by definition the business of empire. It has <b> nothing </b>to do with<b>  race</b>. \n\nIn the end the Europeans were just better at it.\n\nMaybe you should actually read some history.\n\nDo you even know when the mass conquest of Africa began? Here is a clue. Long after Europeans has already abolished slavery. Do you know which people were the first to abolish slavery? Another clue. It wasn't Africans. Do you know which people were the last to abolish slavery? ...... Africans; and they only did it because the Europeans forced them to. \n\nBut lets get back you your planet: Yes the French Impressionist masterpieces were all stolen from Africans. The Moors invented the auto-mobile. Michelangelo was from Mali, who'd have thought!!!  and the Xhosa put the first man in space.\n\nDid you know that the use of entire sentences in all-caps is a sign o<b> f menta</b>l instability?",

                    "commentText": "@kingofpendragon \n\nMost of your post is incoherent and historically inaccurate gibberish. But I will clear up some of the bizarre claims you made anyway just in case anyone else in the thread is interested.\n\nThe Haiti revolt was much more complicated than your simplistic white versus <b> black </b>analysis. Whites and blacks fought on both sides. The war was a combination of various conflicts. On the side of the slaves, there were huge numbers of Spanish imperialists and French Royalists. Against them there were slave owners and traders, both<b>  black</b> and white; along with French Republicans and Spanish troops. The British later also got involved supporting the independence movement. The war also contained several sub-conflicts including a brief civil war between blacks and mullatos. To cast this mess as a simple slave versus owner, o<b> r blac</b>k versus white struggle says more about how your mind works than it does about the Haiti war. You simply see only what you want to see. \n\nYou then claim that the main beneficiaries of the Mali slave trade were the French! Really? If that were true do you really think the French would have abolished it? Actually the main beneficiaries of the Mali slave empire were the Mali elites. The French by that time did not own slaves and did not trade in slaves. They did not benefit from t<b> he Afric</b>an slave trade in any way. \n\n<b> The Afri</b>can slave trade had been booming long before any Europeans arrived in Africa and long before the Industrial Revolution. Most of<b>  the Afr</b>ican Kingdoms sold slaves to <b> other Af</b>rican kingdoms or to Arab traders further north. Europeans did not own slaves. Rich Europeans had paid servants instead and those servants were usually other Europeans. It was not British slave traders who first hooked into this trade and took it across the Atlantic as you claimed; it was Portuguese traders followed by Dutch. The British came much later. Just so you know. \n\nEven at the height of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, there were fa<b> r more A</b>frican slaves owned by other Africans and even more owned by Arabs, than there ever were in the Americas. \n\nBy the early 1800s, slavery, though never really a feature of European societies anyway, had been abolished by every European country. The United States followed in 1865. From 1865, no European or American power allowed slavery in any of its possessions. But slavery still boomed across Africa and millions of people were still being sold into sla<b> very by </b>African slave kingdoms. The so called 'scramble for Africa' began in 1881, long after slavery had already been abolished across the white world, and as European powers quickly divided up the continent they began to abolish slavery and slave trading wherever they found i<b> t. \n\nThe</b> African Kingdoms fought hard against this but they were no match for superior European military force. In Mali for example, millions of slaves were freed as the French colonies expanded inland and the slave centres all along the Niger River were shut down. The British did the same in what is now Nigeria and on the Gold coast. The vast majority of North-West Africa, where most American slaves had come from, had been cleared of slavery by the turn of the twentieth century, by the French. \n\nOf course the Europeans were not in Africa to help. They were there with the same aims of any empire in history, incl<b> uding th</b>e African ones, to plunder resources. They brought their own injustices. But only in Belgian held territory were people no better off under Eur<b> opean th</b>an African rule. The atrocities committed by the Belgians were legendary; just as savage as those committed by the Kinlaza and Kimpanzu Kingdoms which had previously ruled the area. In the Congo the arrival of the Belgians was a case of \u2013 'Meet the new boss \u2013 <b> same</b> as the old one.'\n\nBut across most of the rest of Africa the new boss, though exploitative and unjust, was far less so than the barbaric kingdoms which had preceded him: Which<b>  is why </b>most African people were quite happy<b>  to </b>see those old kingdoms wiped out. \n\nBut wh<b> at about</b> those African territories which retained some form of nominal independence? Well the people there were not so lucky. \n\nThe Ethiopian Empire was forced to abolish slavery by Italy in 1902, although the practise remained widespread throughout large parts of it where Italian influence was not strong. Niger gained its independence from France in 1958 and slavery immediately became legal again. Niger did not finally abolish slavery until 2003. Mauritania also reintroduced slavery when the French moved out. Slavery was abolished there again after UN sanctions in 2007. \n\nSo yes: Europeans engaged in slavery, just not on anything like the same scale as the Africans did. And in the end it was Europeans, not Africans that ended slavery, not Africans. And various forms of slavery still exist in some places, mostly in Africa and the Muslim world even though it is illegal; but it is certainly not tolerated in Europe or North America.",

They go to France because they know they will have more opportunities to build a better life. It's really not complicated.\n\nThere is not one country in Africa which is as open, tolerant and prosperous as France. There are however many countries in Africa where<b>  ethnic</b> tension, tribalism<b> , racis</b>m, and religious bigotry are happening on an epic scale. France - not so much.\n\n\"How disrespectful an ignorant.\"\n\nFacts are not disrespectful or ignorant. They are just facts. Denying the truth because it makes you feel uncomfortable does require ignorance though. \n\n\"Do you know how they constantly try to use stereotypes against us\"\n\nThe video is stereotyping bo<b> th bla</b>ck and white French people. The usual virtue signalling messag<b> e. \"Bl</b>ack people are all perpetual victims and white people are all nasty racists.\" So who do you mean \"they?\" You mean white French people of course. Isn't that you stereotyping them?\n\nIf you are \"choked and sad\" because of someone disagreeing with you on the internet, then you probably need professional help.",

There is also far less<b>  ethnic</b> trouble and religious bigotry in France than there is in many parts of Africa.\n\n'And yes some countries are behind according to western countries' standards'\n\nYes most are behind by French standards and millions of Africans see it that way too. \n\n'But that isnt in any case making them worse to live in.'\n\nYes it is. It is the very definition of making them worse to live in \u2013 obviously.\n\n'And I said that it was ignorant because there are so many more facts explaining why Africans risk everything to go to France, the majority is being told lies, that life in France is always wonderful and as soon as you walk in the country you'll become rich'\n\nNonsense: Which 'lies' specifically<b> ? Nobod</b>y in Africa believes that France is perfect or that you will become automatically rich when you arrive in France. I do not believe Africans are stupid enough to believe that. Many just know that they will have a better opportunity to build a better life in France if they set their minds to it and struggle to make it. That is not a lie.\n\n'France is also to many a passage way to another country or just a momentary home because many ppl come to study. So before saying anything you could also check your facts.'\n\nYes I know people also go to France temporarily. But many more go to remain. I also know that for some it is part of a journey to Britain or elsewhere, but never to Africa. So I am not quite sure what your point is there. \n\n'Where minorities are \"acclaimed\" are the ones where we are depicted with the same stereotypes and traits, like we are all the same, like we all behave like drug selling delinquents beasts.'\n\nN<b> o: Nobo</b>dy thinks that Africans all talk the same or that they all sell drugs. Everybody knows that Africa contains a vast array of different languages and cultures just like Europe. It is not ab<b> out r</b>ace. I have far mor<b> e in co</b>mmon culturally w<b> ith a </b>black European than with a white<b>  South A</b>frican. I have <b> more in</b> commo<b> n with</b> a black Russian than with a white Irish person. I hav<b> e severa</b>l African colleagues who all have different accents and come from completely different culture<b> s. And </b>no: Nobody thinks they sell drugs. They came to Ireland and made good lives for themselves. It wasn't easy and they are not rich. But they did it. Probably because they were not <b> exp<b> e</b</b>>cting a red carpet and they were not demanding that Irish people understand their culture and adapt to accommodate it. They understood that you do not turn up in someone else's house and demand the right to re-arrange the furniture. I understood that too. \n\n'Nothing that tries to be out of that box is ever recognised by the high instances of artistry.'\n\nHmm: A quick Google search will bring you up end<b> less l</b>ists of black French artists, musicians, sports people, designers and developers, scientists and leaders in every field. All highly acclaimed and recognised in France. \n\n'Its exactly what is happening in the US except minorities actually do something serious about it and created their own institutions which is still a work in progress here.'\n\nIf you are<b>  talki</b>ng about Black Lives Matter and their affiliate organisations; then you are way off the mark. BLM have done<b>  more </b>damage to black communities than the KKK could ever have dreamed. They are now by far<b>  the mo</b>st openly racist group in America and they are already bein<b> g shun</b>ned by many black people there. If you really think that spewing hatred at white people and<b>  calli</b>ng for young black men to kill police officers will hur<b> t anyo</b>ne other than black communities then you are deluded. Martin Luther King must be rolling in his grave. \n\nSo yes it is a work in progress in America. So far the progress has all been backwards. BLM have ta<b> rnishe</b>d the image of black people across the USA by living up to exactly the kinds of negative stereotypes you describe. Americans are treated nightly<b>  to sc</b>enes of mobs of <b> black </b>youths thrashing black <b> neighb</b>ourhoods, looting black businesses and beating any white people they can find.\n\nSure: That<b>  is re</b>ally going to help<b>  blac</b>k people in America. Race relations are at their worst in America since the 1960s and it is all thanks to BLM. \n\n'Im not sad and chocked that you are disagreeing with me, I'm sad that you think you can talk about my country like that and especially on an experience that you will never understand which is being a visible minority as we say here. Don't talk so boldly about things that you don't get. Yes to me that is being ignorant.'\n\nWord of advice: When you simply call someone ignorant because they don't agree with you, that usually means you have no point to make \u2013 Just \u2013 'if you don't agree with me you're ignorant.' No<b> t very con</b>vincing: I am an immigrant in the country where I live and part of probably the smallest minority in the country. I know all about stereotypes. Most of them are harmless jokes. But the Irish people have no obligation to me. They have no duty to make me feel at home. They have no duty to learn about my culture. It is up to me to integrate and adapt to their culture.",

There is not less <b> ethnic </b>trouble in france, the only difference is that ppl, here are not delivered with an incredible amount of weapons from other western countries to kill each other. And no, not every<b>  african</b> country is living a civil war, living there can be even better than living in France because the mentalities are different, a sense of fraternity that make these countries better to live in. Western countries' standards are said to be the reference but they are not a insurance of a better life. What you say really shows you've nerver been in an<b> y africa</b>n country.\n\nThey might not be stupid but you might be surprised by their beliefs on France, try to speak with some africans and you'll see, what I said is a true fact.\n\nMy point was exactly what I said, yes some are leaving France for GB but a lot go back to their countries right after graduating. One of the reasons why many dont go back is because they often cant afford the trip back so yes they build a life in the country.\n\nIm not saying everyone thinks like that I was clearly talking about the society that keeps on perpetuating these stereotype<b> s. Bla</b>ck ppl are rarely seen in the media or movies if not in the constant role of poor ghetto ppl, I dont know about your country but Im telling about what is true in mine. The problem is that we are already part of the room but we are never looked at .Ok give me names. Because ind<b> eed bl</b>ack ppl in the french artistry are everywhere but I never really see them, they are rarely promoted, odd.\n\nI wasnt talking about BLM, but on that I think you are wrong, maybe some ppl have been violent and agressive but the intention behind that was<b>  for b</b>lack ppl to not be treated like less than from the american society. BLM has never been about hating on white ppl but on bringi<b> ng up </b>black ppl. They never called to kill police officers, deranged people did that by themselves, young people rioting is not caused by BLM but by the police k<b> illing</b> black people so there your point is invalid. Comparing BLM to KKK is outrageous and quite offensive honestly.\nWhen I said they created instittutions I was refering<b>  to th</b>e black movies industry or BET.\n\nYou just made my point once again! You disagreeing with does not make you ignorant but you saying false facts does! I get that you are a minority but re read what I said, being white can trully help you blend in, here in France so many ppl come from immigration, spanish, german, italian,portuguese etc and Im not saying they are not targeted as minorities but they blend in, ppl dont pay that much attention because they are white, but again as I said, as visible minority, which means, ppl \"of colour\"  we have a completely different experience! One you obviously cant understand. I never said that we dont adapt to french culture, we have , it's been generations now, yet somehow all the things I said above are still going on. \n\nI get th<b> at as an i</b>mmigrant yourself you sort of relate but Im just telling you, our experiences are really different and Im no<b> t even an </b>immigrant myself although my parents were Im just a born <b> and ra</b>ised black french girl.",

It is very difficult to find any culture that was not a coloniser. \n\nI do not know which country your people came from before they lived in France; but if they came from Africa then they probably lived under slave empires that had <b> nothing </b>to do with France. \n\nThe point is simple. Yes France did bad things. So did everybody else.

They might have been able to preserve their culture of festivals of mass human sacrifice and their blood sports if the Spanish had not arrived.\n\nAs for the East. You correctly condemn French actions in Indochina; but you do not seem to have a problem with Pol Pot for example; or any of the other monsters that came out of East Asia. Of course France committed crimes as did everybody else. But you seem to have an obsessive need to hate the country that you live in. \n\nSo why do you live there?

The development and modernisation in places like Senegal for example, are mostly paid for by France.\n\nIt was the French after all who abolished slavery across West Africa, as the<b>  African</b> Kingdoms fought to preserve it. It was the French who also abolished the caste system and the traditions of human sacrifice. It was the French who brought the rule of law, the principles of enlightenment and the concept of human rights; none of which had previously existed in the horrifically bruta<b> l Africa</b>n kingdoms. \n\nThe French were not there as an act of charity. Like any other empire, they were there for conquest and resources; just like the even more brutal and exploitati<b> ve Afric</b>an empires before them. But the French left most of those territories in far better shape than they found them, and they still support them with massive amounts of funding, industry and jobs.\n\nOf course all empires are exploitative and the French one was no exception. It is often air-brushed from history that Africans had always been colonised, just like Europeans. Before the rapid colonisation of Africa by Europeans in the late 1800s; Africans had been colonised by other Africans and Europeans by other Europeans. \n\nThe fact remains though; that the average W<b> est Afri</b>can was probably better off under a French governor than they had been under a Mali king. \n\nMaybe you should educate yourself a little on the history behind the subjects you want to talk about instead of just cherry picking the bad things that one county did and ignoring everything else. \n\nThe reality is that if it were not for the French; West Africans would probably still be living in mud huts and enslaving each other in the millions.",

                    "commentText": "@Bela T.T \n'You and millions of ignorant whites think Africa survive with the mercy and aid of westerns aid'\n\nI never said that. I said that many former colonial powers spend massive amounts on foreign aid. The European ones at least: I never said that any country depended on French aid; just that it helps a lot of them.\n\nYou projected your own narrow prejudice onto what you believe I think, and you make it clear that you make that judgement based on the colour of my skin. And while you talk about 'ignorant white people,' you have the <b> blind </b>arrogance to imply that I am some kind of<b>  racist</b>. I was not talking about an<b> y rac</b>e like that. I was not stereotyping a<b> ny ra</b>ce at all. You were. \n\nI suggest you read your own words, look in the mirror and ask yourself which of us is <b> the rac</b>ist.\n\n'The aid distribution is not fair the money goes back in double to their own banks you can read how the so called aid benefits the countries who give for other countries. There are books and videos which provide with some good evidences you can take look how it works.'\n\nI do know how it works. I also know about corrupt banks and corrupt companies and corrupt politicians: These are not exclusively the preserve of white people you know. Are you really suggesting that governments in Africa are not corrupt? \n\nThe message from you is very clear: That white people did bad things in the past and now they owe a debt to their former colonies. I outlined some of the complicated history behind your naieve claim in order to point out <b> that b</b>lack people were just as guilty of doing bad things. You do not seem to believe<b>  that </b>black people have the same responsibility to accept responsibility: Better by far to just blame an <b> entir</b>e race. \n\nMy point was very clear: That colonialism, slavery, corruption and exploitation are human issues: They are perpetrated by people of all colours and people of all colours have also been the victims of them at different times. \n\nYou just want to blame white people for everything. But you'r<b> e not a</b> racist???\n\nYou then start banging on about NATO and its attack on Libya: I am not sure why. I despise NATO and I would not support any attack on Libya. Once again you make assumptions about what I believe because of my skin colour \u2013 because you'<b> re not </b>a racist \u2026\u2026 or something. \n\nYou demand that I not bring up the crimes of the Mali empire to cover 'my ancestors barbaric deeds.' Once again you miss the point. My ancestors had no colonies in Africa. But that doesn't seem to matter to you. All that matters to you is the colour of someone's skin. Because you<b> 're not</b> a racist\u2026\u2026\u2026. Or something. \n\n'Then you can tell me why i need to educate my self instead of yourself\u270c.Africans did NOT ask european envas<b> ion.'\n\n</b>No: Nobody ever asks for an invasion. But then millions of Africans also did not ask to be conquered and sold into slavery by the Mali kingdoms either. It is very simple really. Colonialism and slavery etc are about power and wealth and greed. They are not, and have never been about skin colour. \n\nSecondly if my ancestors did colonise Africa; which they did not; then would that make me somehow guilty by association? My country was also invaded and millions of people killed and enslaved. Should a modern day German kid who was not even born then feel guilty about that? Of course not: Stop b<b> eing si</b>lly: Nobody is responsible for things that happened before they were even born.\n\n\n'They were all fine with their Arts,Culture,Religione and Civilization.So dont bring Mali civilazation to cover up your ancestors barbaric deeds.'\n\nNo they were not fine. Maybe the ruling elites were f<b> ine. But</b> the African kingdoms also built the continent into the world centre of slavery. They were tyrannical, brutal and oppressive in the extreme and most of their victims were Africans. \n\nAnd guess what. You don't have any way to blame that on white people, so you just pretend it never happened. Because<b>  you're</b> not a racist??? But i<b> t is </b>all about race to you. You make that clear all through your posts. \n\n'The Malians never asked Britishes or french to raped them,killed them or enslaved them'\n\nSlavery had been abolished across Europe before the Mali territories were colonised by the British and French. The British and French both forced the abolition of slavery in west Africa wherever they controlled. \n\nOnce again when you claim that the British and French enslaved the Malians you display a shocking ignorance of history. The Malians were enslaved by other Malians and sold all over Africa, the Middle East and shipped to India and the Americas too, right up to the late 1800s when the French and British began colonising Africa and stamping out slavery. \n\n'All their kings gold which estimated in billions taken to England still person'\n\nWhat? The French took all the Mali King's gold and gave it to the British? \n\nNow you're just babbling. That makes no sense at all.\n\n\n'like you here try to defend what the colonial countries shame history.'\n\nI do not defend colonialism. You do. I simply say that everybody did it.

You are looking at <b> African </b>cultures through rose tinted glasses and ignoring any fact that do not fit your <b> 'black</b> man good \u2013 white man bad' narrative. That is not how to do history. \n\n\"What i have said abt mali gold or wes<b> t Africa</b>n cilization and the consequence of civilzation is all recorded.\"\n\nRecorded where? Citation please! I have been studying and lecturing about this period of history for 15 years. I know of no instance where the French took a Mali King's gold and gave it to the British. The French and British were rivals in Africa. You do know that don't you? \n\nI am well aware that European conquerors stole any valuables they could find anywhere they conquered. I also know th<b> at Afric</b>an conquerors did the same, so I am not sure what your point is. \n\n\n'You are trying to play smart by putting abolishment of slavery to justify of colonization.'\n\nI am writing this as clearly as possible because you insist once again in misreading what I said. I did not make any attempt to justify colonisation. Colonisation was a crime. I simply pointed out that it was not something that was the preserve of any <b> one r</b>ace: Africans did it too. \n\nI added that while Europeans did indeed to bad things they also did some very good things. I used the abolition of slavery as one example. Don't you agree that that was a European campaign that brought freedom and hope to millions of people, most of them Africans, and do you not agree that it is something that Europeans have the right to be proud of? \n\nYou do realise that Frenchmen fought against slavery w<b> hile Afr</b>ican kingdoms fought for it. And large numbers of Africans supported those Frenchmen too. \n\n'If that country were left without your countries colonization they would have do the same as Ethiopia did without the help of white man'\n\nWell I already told you; my country did not colonise anywhere in Africa; but Really? So now you've got a historical crystal ball. Sorry but it is a fact that when the French arrived in West Africa; the barbaric Mali kingdoms ruled over most of it. Those kingdoms were built on slavery and exploitation of their subject peoples and had been for centuries.\n\nThe French stole much in the way of resources; but they also abolished slavery, human sacrifice and the caste system. They overthre<b> w the Af</b>rican kings who subjugat<b> ed the A</b>frican people. Yet you glorify those<b>  brutal </b>African kings and don't seem to care a<b> bout the</b> African people who were tortured and enslaved by them. It is impossible to say how those territories would have developed had the French not colonised them. But we do know what they were like in 1880, just before the French expansion. They were backward, barbaric and ruled over by bloodthirsty tyrants <b> who care</b>d nothing about the humanity of their own people.\n\nYou favour the oppressor over the oppressed; except of course when the oppressor happens to be white. \n\n'White man inited themselves their to take what did not belong to them'\n\nY<b> es. So</b> did black men. Everybody did it. That was precisely my point. But you only have a problem with it when white men do it. \n\nYou make every<b> thing</b> about race and that makes you a bigot. \n\n\n'What would jew person feel if <b> you t</b>ell him nazi germany was so great for them?'\n\nWell I cannot imagine anyone saying that to a Jew and if someone did say that then that Jewish person would probably think that the person who said that was obviously an idiot and ignorant of history. \n\nKind of like suggesting that the Mali Kingdoms were great for Africans: \n\nI think that Jewish man would take the same view as me on the Nazis a<b> s well a</b>s the African Kingdoms as well as atrocities committed by Europeans. He would probably see murder and torture and slavery as evil; no matter who does it. It is not OK when Africans do it. \n\nHis<b> tory i</b>s not so black and white. There have been more Europeans killed or enslaved by other Europeans than by Africans. There have been far more Africans killed and enslaved by other Africans than by Europeans.\n\nThe large<b> st genoc</b>ides in African history were carried out by Africans; the most recent attempted genocide being in Rwanda. There were no white people involved and when the massacres were eventually stopped; it was by the intervention of Europeans. \n\nShould they not have tried to stop it because they were white or because they were not invited or whatever you are trying to say? The Tanzanians also tried to stop it but they lacked the military power. But should they have stayed away because they too<b>  are </b>a different race? \n\nYou are not only chroni<b> cally ig</b>norant of African history, but you also red<b> uce t</b>he<b>  concept</b> of race to noth<b> ing bu</b>t skin colour. Black people come <b> from a </b>large range of ethnic groups and cult<b> ures.</b> They are not one race.<b>  Like</b>wise Europeans: My race is Slavic. We are w<b> hite.</b> We are a different race from the French, just the same as a person of Ban<b> tu or</b>igin is not the same race as someone of Swahili origin. \n\nIt<b>  is o</b>nly racists who think race is all about skin colour. It is only racists who convince themselves that the people of their racial group are blameless and the people with some other skin colour must be blamed for everything. It is only racists who believe that the<b>  curr</b>ent generation of some race or other, must atone for the sins of their ancestors, not because they are guilty of anything, but because they have the same skin colour. It is only racists who stereotype entire groups of people based on such superficial things as skin colour; and then demonise them for crimes that happened a century before they were even born. \n\nSo take a look in the <b> mirror </b>Bella. You will see a racist looking back at you.",

Much of Spain, Italy and the Balkans had already been conquered by Islam before the first crusade was even a twinkle in Pope Urban's eye. \n\nIt was a case of European kings finally deciding to put aside their differences and tackle a dangerous enemy that was a threat to all of their kingdoms. Taking the Holy Land back from the Moors was a good motive to appeal to European Christians, but the real purpose was to drive Islam out of Europe, smash the power of Islam in the near east and secure Europe for the building of western civilisation. \n\nEuropeans have been successfully keeping Islam at bay ever since. Attempts by centuries of Moors, Saracens and Turks have tried to conquer Europe. They all failed. \n\nBut now Europe is being betrayed by its own quisling classes, personified by traitors like Ankela Merkel and Francois Hollonde. Their predecessors have for generations spilled their own blood to protect Europe from Islam and to preserve the European way of life. Now these traitors throw open the gates and invite Islam in. \n\nBut the wind of change is bowing through Europe again and it is refreshing. Merkel is the most unpopular German leader of the last forty years. Hollonde is also facing a massive backlash in France with Marine Le Pen topping the polls. They will both be gone next year. The Brits have already made their feelings clear. Poland and Hungary have closed their borders and told the EU to butt out. The Russian president has openly declared that 'Russia is not a 'multicultural society, Russia is a Russian society.' So that <b> old </b>European tradition of protecting the borders and their way of life is being re-born. Despite all the<b>  limp</b> wristed 'progressivists' we see on our TV screens, there seems to be plenty of Europeans left who still have a little of the blood of those medieval knights running in their veins. \n\nIn America too things are looking up. The American people, also the heirs of those medieval knights, have said 'NO' to Hillary Clinton's multicultural, gender-bending, hedonistic, anything goes mindset. They have sent a clear message. 'No we don't hate other people, but this is America. We also have our history and or way of life and we are tired of our own so called leaders telling us we should be ashamed of it. \n\nSo go ahead and build that wall Mr Trump. Protect your borders. You are not <b> a racis</b>t. You are just doing your job, putting your own people first. That is what you are elected to do. Maybe if you get a chance you could visit Europe and point that out to Merkel and co. \n\nEurope and North America have built the most successful and most advanced civilisations in human history. They share a rich tradition that reaches back 2500 years. They have given the world Greek Philosophy, French enlightenment, the concept of democracy and human rights, the rule of law, modern medicine, the most magnificent art, literature and architecture; and far too many inventions, discoveries and innovations to mention.\n\n\nIf that is not a culture superior to the backward barbaric alternative that Islam offers then I don't know what is.",

How will the departure of those European companies impact on employment rates and revenue in South Africa? Of course the best thing for South Africans would be to develop their own mining companies and replace the European ones little by little; but like I said; if they don't want to do that, then blaming Europeans is a bit pointless. \n\nLarge corporations do not operate to make anyone's life better anyway. They operate to make profit. It doesn't matter whether they are European or<b>  African</b>. Gazprom is a major Russian company. I am a Russian citizen. Do you think Gazprom cares about me or acts in my interests? \n\nI do acknowledge the faults of Europe and they are many. The difference is that I blame them on Europeans, not on other people who have no control over them. \n\nIf you have a problem with what happens in South Africa; then you need to take it up with the Sout<b> h Africa</b>n government. \n\nWhining about other people on a different continent is just silly.",

France is called France because it was home to the Franks, a specific group of people that came in and established themselves here.

If anybody can began anything and replace the natives without a single care in the world, then there is absolutely no reason to have different countries or languages at all.\n\nI won't let you steal my heritage and my people'<b> s natio</b>n. You should learn to love your own people a<b> nd nati</b>on instead of running away. If you were born in France, then go back to your ancestral lands and fight to make it better. Mass immigration and people moving with a \"fuck white people\" attitude is helping create more racists like myself who are defending our identity and diversity in humanity.

Something ive found being an adult is when Im talking to someone and am attempting to describe a<b>  black</b> person i would try hard not to mention by skin but literally its the best descriptor and without it noone knows who the heck your talking about or it takes too long. How do we describe others? but hair skin and height. She is really pale or sometimes really white.  Dont take it personally, and also you dont need to mention you<b> r rac</b>e when applying for a job... they ask but you can usually select other or just straight up chose a different one if you'd like(tbh its probably in your benefit to cho<b> se bla</b>ck<b>  or afri</b>can american which doesn't make sense anymore). While choosing white is a disadvantage these days depending how competitive the position is.\n\n\nNext if you are speaking of tulsa... hell if there is anyone alive who ordered that or experienced it id be suprised. Just because my irish/scottish ancestors where slaves i dont hate other people who may have had ancestors that had them for it, im just trying to live the one life i was given, and love as much as I can.  \n\n\nAll that a<b> side </b>race is a fucking joke... We're all humans last I checked and this made up<b>  word</b> race is bullshit.  The sooner we stop wearing someone elses past as a badge of our identity.

In 1990, the U.S. government funded Planned Parenthood went to<b>  black</b> schools and told girls they wanted to give them birth control and they sterilized these tee<b> n blac</b>k girls. You know in 1991, the gov. offerered low income housing <b> to bla</b>ck families that had high levels of lead in order to study the effects of high lead levels in the body? Did you also know t<b> hat bl</b>ack communities in the U.S. are more likely to be poisoined. They switched over a good water supply to dirty water <b> with</b> old pipes with high lead levels without treating the water and tons of people got sick. The  children in Flint are now mentally retarded because  lead is a brain toxin and causes violent behavior. You know the 13th Amendment in the U.S. says slavery is abolished except as punishment for a crime? So after 1865, the prison population went from 90% white t<b> o 90% </b>black. The government c<b> reated</b> Black Codes that were o<b> nly fo</b>r black people where they would arrest blacks for not having a job, being homeless, leaving their wife or husband, spitting, not being skilled for a job or not having an id card. Railroad companies and coal companies paid prisons to get them workers so prisons had a need to keep them full in order for them to get paid. Although, convict leasing slowed down in 1931 due to the need for soldiers for World War II it still exist today. Big companies pay industrial prisons to keep prisons full,\n Whole Foods is one <b> of the</b>m. Black people on crack were given the harshes sentences but whites on cocaine were given more lenient sentences and treatment. Crack is cheaper so more blacks could afford it and crack w<b> as put</b> in black communities by our very gov. to fund the War in Nicaragua. It's funny how you can tell a people who are constantly targeted <b> due t</b>o o<b> ur race an</b>d ethnicit<b> y not</b> t<b> o see r</b>ace or racism, when we are the most affected by it. Blacks whose families have been in the U.S. for 300 years have experience<b> d never</b> ending racism but somehow we should ignore it? We are harassed by the police at random remember the Stop and Frisk law which said that the police could just pa<b> t down</b> a random black male on the street? The 3 Strikes law whi<b> ch als</b>o affected black men heavily. Now there is a law where they can search your car and house if they want without a warrant and if you protest you go to<b>  jail. A</b>mer<b> ica is </b>nothing but racism. You know the U.S. news oversatu<b> rates </b>the news with black crime so that white citizens believe that they are justified to abuse our rights because they believe all blacks are criminals? Everyday white Americans go around c<b> alling</b> the police on black people for just being in their neighborhood, taking pics in a park, selling lemonade, being in their own coll<b> ege libr</b<b> >ary. </b>This one African woman had the police called on her for going into her own gated community.",

BTW can we have the North of Africa back, I think it's about time now for it to be returned to Europe... \n\nAs for South Korea Europeans had a heavy hand in that as did Japan which also modernized thanks to the help of Europeans. South Korea also received the second largest amount of donation aid in the 1960 and it was the USA that purchased most of the products. Europeans gave them technology, lent and gave them money and then also purchased their products so It's not really what you thought it was. \n\nIf it wasn't for the Europeans Africans would have extremely low technology right now, many Africans wouldn't have been born and even more would be dead, due to disease, war, famine etc. Africans should be thankful over colonization which helped uplift their people, especially in America, where some of the most Privileged Africans live.",

I get that ur American but its so clear that Americans think that the racial issues that face America are relevant throughout the whole world... \nIn Europe there are no \"original <b> black </b>people\" , so if a person is<b>  black</b> or darker complected its illogical to call them<b>  \"blac</b>k\". We usually go <b> by nationali</b>ty. Either a person is Nigerian, Colombian, Kenyan, Somali, Iraqi etc.. and if a person is obviously mi<b> xed r</b>ace the person is simply labeled \"mixed\", and then maybe further explains their heritage. \nIm Norwegian and Kenyan, born and raised in Norway. Not once in my life have I ever looked at mysel<b> f as b</b>lack or even been c<b> alled </b>black. Once I moved to America I was suddenly la<b> beled </b>\"black\" and \"light skinned\".. It really is quite strange, because s<b> o ofte</b>n black Americans get offended if a biracial person says they<b> 're no</b>t \"black\", but mixed.. which is absolute rubbish.. U cant have one white paren<b> t and </b>one black parent and simply pretend to o<b> nly b</b>e one race..AND YES, YOU'RE COMPLEXION IS IRRELEVANT.",

Actually the south of France is very \"latin\". There are a lot of people who came from Italian and Spanish descent. And they are considered as white people. I'm myself French and Italian. The north is more German because of Franks invasion etc. \n\nIn the south, maybe that people have not necessarily blue eyes or blond hair, but their color skin is white for the majority of them. Italy and Spain used to be great Europeans countries in the past and they took part in the occidental history. They are occidental and caucasian countries . \n\nIn fact, as a French, i think that you, Americans, have a strange way to etablish skin colors. In France, for example, Obama is considered as a \"m\u00e9tis\" or a \"mul\u00e2tre\", but not as a <b> black </b>guy. His mother is white, so for me and for a lot of French, it doesn't make any sense to consider him as a 100%<b>  black</b> guy. He is bot<b> h blac</b>k and white. \n\nPS: sorry for the grammatical errors.",

This title of being<b>  black</b> despite only having on<b> e blac</b>k parent, stems from the current situation in America as well as a history. To an extent like Europe you are more tolerated when you are mix, but in America - there are two version of it and it is and America for white (regardless of being affluent or not, and bei<b> ng bla</b>ck - or<b>  of Afri</b>can descent ) We find this same similarity in the video above. In America, I even notice more of a tolerance for blacks who are immigrants. Its not a matter of just social behavior, but laws, education and life. Also there is a down fall in dismis<b> sing Afr</b>ican descent i<b> n mix</b> race people - see the history of Haiti. My mom who is mix receives the same treatment as me here in America. \n\nWhile Europeans like to pride themselves as bein<b> g less </b>racist. I've heard the sentiments of pan-Africans experiences, in compar<b> ison of </b>African American or the Blacks from the Antilles (West Indies, Spanish or smaller islands) are life-altering different. I was startled when a European friend spoke with such disdain towards (pan) Africans and looked at me for confirmation. However, he said that he liked the mixed because they were much more attractive. I replied to him, well thank god for the Congolese, for without them, their would be no diamonds, chocolate, or amputees  - your neighbors in Belgium would only have waffles and the rest of Europe to depend on.  He seemed uncomfortable!\n\nIn regards to mixed, with migration - even though the Irish<b>  or<b>  </b</b>>more red head and the Italian and Greeks are more brunettes - you are all European or White. Unless in Europe wher<b> e their is n</b>ationality, you can travel the world and you are not sub-categorized like blacks. - but please keep the conversation going, I like this.",

I'll type that again for you<b> .  \"rac</b>ism doesn't mean wh<b> en a b</b>lack person is the victim\".  \n3) Look how you can name parts of London<b>  that e</b>thnic people can't walk through without getting into some kind of altercation.  Why didn't you mention the areas - and there are plenty of them - where white people can't walk through without some kind of altercation?\n4) You even use the phrase \"our people\".  Wh<b> ich is </b>racism personified.  And you don't even see the irony.\nYou have to stop loo<b> king at</b> racism through one eye.

I find it funny because if you're <b> black </b>in America, you're an American; especially since half of us run around talking about our baby hairs come from our Native American ancestry, saying your hair is wavy because of<b>  Indian</b> blood, or you have high cheek bones because of a<b> n India</b>n ancestor when in reality, those high cheek bones could have come from Africa as well. So if we have Native American blood mixed, born in this country, that make us part American right? Don't give me a bull shit side answer, be fucking direct. On average most of us in the states are part European, most<b> ly Afric</b>an, if I'm correct, <b> our Afri</b>can blood falls between 60%-90%, those on the 60% side, usually are the people who come out with different features<b> , or Afr</b>ican features but lighter skin,  different eye, or hair color. I know my history, I wish slavery didn't happen but it did. I can't deny that. I'm not going to deny most of us have mixed ancestry because of rape or some of it might've been because of love; I also wonder if white Americans acknowledge they might be<b>  part </b>black? All<b>  these</b> black people in America running around with green/hazel/grey/blue eyes (Not contacts) or different shades of hair (not dyed) obviously have a heavy European back ground, however I see white people sometimes who everything about the<b> m look</b>s black except there hair and skin tone but, \"oh, the features in Europe have a wide range\" yeah okay, I can get with that, because there <b> are some</b> African tr<b> ibe<b> s</b</b>> with red hair or very rare some with blue eyes but lets be honest, if you're family has been here for some time and your white, those hips or tight soft hair you got, I'm sure it co<b> mes from</b> an African ancestor.

            "commentText": "I don't think we're <b> racist </b>in France (might be a few, but what can we do ?). We believe in integration, meaning that the people coming to live here will be French and slowly merge into our culture and society (while if they want remaining aware of where they're from, and proud if they want to).\n\nThere is maybe a limit to that : French don't like people that are French on paper, live in France, are born in France but don't feel French. That's the signal that integration didn't work. It's not<b>  racism</b>... It's us seeing that integration didn't work.\nThat's also why some Muslims cause issues : they don't want to share our culture and our ideas. A society can only survive if its people share the same interests and ideas (guess why the Roman Empire fell?).\n\nFrance is not like the USA  : we don't want to have minorities all over the place, living among themselves. Sadly it happens, because we underestimate the difficulties it is for people to integrate. Turns out education in school is not enough, and especially in banlieues people don't see a lot of French (feeling French) so they can't integrate. The more the reject French cultures and ideas and the more they'll have a hard time with French I guess. It's a complicated issue here, because we want people to feel French while they don't want to integrate (some even start to hate France). Like I said : complex, different from the USA : welcome to Europe.\n(and now you understand why Germany will have difficulties if they bring 1M Syrians in their country).\nI'll even say this : far right in France is no<b> t racis</b>t. They just want the French culture not to take anything from other cultures, and they want all the people in France to be as French as possible. There is <b> no raci</b>sm. But they are too stringent on their definition of French, and are home to a lot of racists.\n\n\nIf you think about culture and n<b> ot \"r</b>ace\" (fuck I don't like to use this word because it make no sense, THERE I<b> S NO </b>RACE, WAKE UP AMERICA) you'll understand why did you <b> see a </b<b> >black</b> woman from the USA that does not share the Afro-American culture. I think the word we use (cul<b> ture </b>VS race) tells us a lot about our countries ;)\n\nAnd gosh we're bad in English x_x",

            "commentText": "That girl at Trocadero pretty much sumed it up. France is strongly attached to its history and culture, perhaps a bit too much sometimes, whereas the US promotes diversity. People of extremist parties are more often than not people that are a little too attached to their historic culture to understand that a culture necessarly evolves & changes. They only see immigrants as a threat whereas others also see them as a chance. My personal opinion is that massive unqualified immigration in a country that is loosing its industries to services (like most of the modern world, thanks to China) won't lead to anything good, underqualified people are having a hard time getting jobs already (10% without a job in France). We can have controlled immigration but the number we are seeing in Europe that past year are starting to get a bit scary given our economic situation.",

Also this type of drawing is called a \"caricature\" so just go and search what it means. I have been to America, my dad actually is from there but I live in France. America is rea<b> lly rac</b>ist compared to France or any other European country. Of course some people<b>  are ra</b>cist in France but every country has idiots. Whereas in the US. You have a whole lot more of racists than we do. (like look at half the people who wanna run for president now...) \nyeah..

It's not a fair attitude for others you judge too quickly (and believe me, you can't deeply understand a country in a few days asking people on the capital). Your attitude toward this simple picture is very representative of your obsession (because this is what it seems to be : an obsession). You can do more than <b> \"being</b> a black man\". You can just be a man, travel and enjoy the meetings and the culture. Here, the color of your skin is as important and interesting as the color of your eyes, your hair and your shoes. It would be ridiculous to define yourself\u00a0by the color of your hair or your shoes, right ? As a french, when I see a man, whatever is color is, obsessed by it and asking about it people on the street, the only thing I think is : how ridiculous.

Of course there is racisme in France, <b> but rac</b>ist people living in France are not French people, no matter they have offician Fr<b> ench nationa</b>lity or they are in France since a lot of generati<b> on, a r</b>acist is not a French people for me, i refuse it!\nYou have to fight for your right my frend ! no<b> t as a</b> Black or Chines or Withe, but as a Human Being ! I hope Sincerly a good evolution of the condi<b> tion o</b>f Black people in USA !",

It is easy to do this because most of blacks are ashamed of their ancestral identity and they would rather a white man's identity a white man's name etc. By accepting those however doesn't make them any more acceptable to a white community. They still remain outcast and excluded. Do you know other races who call themsel<b> ves Afri</b>can when they immigrate to Africa? None. The Indians, Arabs, Europeans etc who live in Africa retain their ancestral identities and their names and even their language. They never get deprived of their identities even if they stay for for thousands of years. Have you asked why the Boers speak Afrikaans(a dutch version) instead of Xhosa, Zulu or whatever native language? Have you heard their names? They dont call themselves\u00a0Bhekithemba,Butholezwe or Bambanani. And by the way they dont call themse<b> lves Afr</b>ican, even if they dont call themselves British or Dutch but they have their own identit<b> y not Af</b>rican. And they are just proud of it. Find any latino guy anywhere and check their last name you will always read Ramirez, Garcia, etc whether they are in France or Brazil. Bu<b> t only</b> black people are the ones lacking identity because they always like to pick up their slave master's identity rather than their ancestors'",

His parents are from Nigeria. But he was born and raised in the UK and all he ever knew was the UK. So he decided to represent the UK. So because he is a really good boxer. The white British people call him English and argue against any Nigerian that tries to say their Nigerian. The same with Giannis Antetokounmpo. Parents are from Nigeria and migrated to Greece. He was born in Greece and raised there. All he ever knew was Greece. So because of that he represented Greece. Greek people in general are<b>  racist</b> towards blacks. But because he is an amazing athlete the Greeks argue against any Nigerian that tries to claim the he is not Greek. Whereas if it was an unknow<b> n blac</b>k person claiming they were from Greece or the Uk. They would most likely say no. Your parents immigrated here so you're still Nigerian. To all of you idiots. If we moved Anthony Joshua and Antetokounmpo back to Nigeria. Would they know the culture, or the type of society or the law. NO! Because they were not brought up there. (And before you try and say I'm just anoth<b> er bla</b>ck person looking to disown Africa and claim Europe as mine) IM WHITE BITCH! Selfish motherfuckers. Always trying to claim the popu<b> lar bl</b>ack people but disown the the normal working c<b> lass b</b>lack person. We need to sort ourselves out cause.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs not healthy",

As far as Africa and Haiti, you again have to realize that a lot of what you see represented in media is very one sided. Many countries in Africa are still suffering recovering from the effects of colonization. Several of the governments have only recently been controlled by native africans and the European run governments were just as cruel and corrupt if not more. Other places in Africa are very modern and wealthy, but that's the part people don't want you to see.",

I know there are bad cops out there, but most of them really just want to help and do their job right. THese videos on social media are really just small examples, but the mainstream media blows it up and makes it sound like half of the cops in the country behave this way its ridiculous.

Until the 1960's the South voted for Democrats and were traditionally pro-slavery and Anti-Voting Rights Act. This is where terms like Dixiecrat, Solid South, Southern Democrats come from. Also, you could simply just ask Strom Thurmond.Alslo, You are basically saying that cops weren't killing unarmed people until the media and liberals started blowing it out of proportion or that it simply didn't matter.",

I am from Turkey and I wanted to study in France as an exchange student for a limited time... Even though the Embassy was provided with all the necessary files, I wasn't given the visa, so I had to go to Istanbul once again, to see what was wrong. Obviously, there were some missing files which WERE NOT MENTIONED on their website. Oh and as I was going to study at a French university for a while as a person coming from a non-European country, I had to pay 150 lira (around 50 euro) to CampusFrance, just to get my \"files validated\"! And I had to go to Istanbul for that again! Oh but no it's not over, they said that for healthcheck I had to go to Istanbul again, that goddamn OFII thingie. Then after all that hassle finally I got my visa and came to France, but no, the ordeal was not over yet. As I'm from Turkey, they do not accept any health insurance brought from Turkey, so they made me pay 213 euro for so-called health insurance. And 58 euro for my residence permit.\u00a0\nFrance is not<b>  racist</b> my ass. It is the mos<b> t racis</b>t country I have ever seen. On memorial day of so-called Armenian genocide, they pulled up a French flag in front of the dormitory I was staying in.",

Historically speaking, Europeans thought of tribal Africans as savages, lesser humans, and treated them as children. That's probably why they decided to use a man who is dressed like that. Maybe there's this idea that Obama isn't suited for the task. There seems to be a fear hidden throughout everything that has happened. It's the same with the natives and Canada, and Australia, USA, etc. Just thinking about that reminds me of a few things. \n\nThis image says a lot, and I'm glad it was brought to our attention.",

They were more conservative about over voicing any concerns. The US, it's so divided that we feel it more and it's more in your face. People are angry and to a point deserve to be. People in Europe can discuss these issues without feeling as though they are attacking anyone. I have European friends and American friends. There is<b>  racism</b> everywhere. Some advertisements like what we saw in the video are shocking and I will never understand them. But, France has always been an open and accepting country. My friends who ask how I could have lived in Italy, they are racists. I remind them that in the beginning of the Katrina hurricane in New Orleans, Italy was one of the if not the first country to send help. USA was not even close to sending help by the time Italy help arrived. During the 20's and 30's when all hell was breaking out racially in the US, Paris was a safe haven for blacks.

The whites told them this story to leave their homes? Stop this BS told by some radical Afrocentric liar. Do my research? I say it is you that needs to do the research fool. Only 3% went to the USA and the rest to the Caribbean and most to Brazil. Slavery of blacks? Maybe research the Arabs which took more but smart enough to castrate them. It was blacks taking whites from their homes as slaves to a far worse death but forgotten. Whites had guns? Are you telling me the so advanced blacks could not come up with the bow and arrow? In the days of slavery the bow was actually superior in many ways but so much for blacks lack of creativity. Outnumbered whites 3 to 1 and defending their own terf! Only 3% owned slaves in the USA and some were blacks and interesting most refused to return to Africa after the Civil War and those that did started slave plantations.

Are you seriously trying to sit here and tell me that slavery did not happen to<b>  black</b> people  and that it wa<b> s blac</b>k people that took whites from their home? lol wow.. Many Africans were misled and deceived\u00a0into thinking they were going to go to a better place. What about the ones that we're not sold into slavery by other africans? are you just forgetting about them, or are you just not mentioning them because it makes your argument sound better? while true, SOME africans sold themselves into slavery, the africans that were sold by other africans were the prisoners of the tribes. They only sold the people that they had captured from other tribes from wars they fought amongst themselves. And the criminals. That would clearly not have been enough for millions of the slaves that were transported, so you know what happened? The Europeans came back and stole people and killed whomever got in their way. Once you think about it, if you were the chief of a tribe, and someone wanted to take your people away from their home, would you send yourself, and the rest of the good tribal members, or the prisoners that no one wanted to associate with? Because as I said before, it wasn't like white people nicely asked them to get into slavery, they had guns.\u00a0Where did you get \"only 3% owned slaves in the USA\"? That's not true, also of white Americans back then own<b> ed bla</b>ck people. There were a lot  of slaves <b> and bl</b>ack people had no rights. But it's funny how you say \"Only 3% went to the USA\" and \"Only 3% owned slaves in the USA \" caught you in a lie! If only 3% then where did all of t<b> hese Afr</b>ican Americans come from? The families of<b>  most Af</b>rican Americans today have been living in the U.S for years and do you see how they don't know where they descend from in Africa? They can't tell you any of that because it was stripped away from them. Here is an article that can help you out\u00a0 [LINK] \nPlease read and do your research before you speak foolishness.",

I wonder why I was asked by several <b> black </b>teens to help them with their stuck truck in the woods yesterday. Why they tried to drive their truck there is a wonder but<b>  crazy</b> teens. No blacks are good and many are my good friends. Lol you say about slavery? are you so ignorant? I never said slavery did not happen; it was in ever<b> y rac</b>e. Wait let me re read. Nope I never said that so I guess comprehension is your problem to twist things to fit your agenda. \u00a0Many mis lead to go to a better place? By blacks if any. I suppose after some 200 years and seeing blacks raid the villages and chaining people and raping others to the ports to be sold just never occurred that it was not a nice place. Are you serious? Not hardly could they had been so ignorant. Wow, lol? you truly are selective in your research but then a very creative people but logic and reasoning not. I suppose you have knowledge that only blacks were enslaved and NEVER whites. Slavery only in the America's right? Slavery continues today and legally in parts of Africa child. I fought on the dark continent freeing blacks oppressed by blacks in ways your small mind could not dream. Yes, we freed them in Angola. Why do you skip in your replies? Only criminals and they whites with guns who never left the ports took them to they were deceived to thinking they were going to a better place? Get your story straight as you sound so wishy washy. No whites left to find free blacks from the ports. Blacks brought plenty to\u00a0SELL. Slavery was the way of the times. Was it good? Of course not\u00a0but you were blessed by it. The whites, or Moors delt in slvery. A slave in the USA was worth more than a new car today. Yes only 3% to inclu<b> de bla</b>ck owners had slaves in the USA and slavery was outlawed within 80 years. 97% did not own them . You said for me to do my research before speaking? Hey you should try as it is an easy look up. America for the most treated them well as far as slaves were treated. Did horrible things happen? Yes they did but to burn a new car was not the normal. After the Civil War was the horrible and it certainly was I agree. Blacks did have their choice to return to Africa and few did as most saw it a death sentence. Those that did to Liberia started plantations and slaves to work their farms. Whites had guns again ? They did not need guns fool as the slaves were brought to them chained and bound by other blacks! Whites did not go into the jungles for free blacks. Blacks did it for profit. I guess you <b> are bl</b>ind to the truth that your ancestors were sold by their own. I would be bothered by it as well.. Caught me in a lie about the 3% to the USA? No, caught you in ignorance you are too proud to research.\u00a095% went to the Caribbean and most to Brazil. Must I repeat myself another time. I did not make it up fool. You lol? Only makes you the joke. The USA went to war to free slaves and that is a fact which many whites died. NO slaves would had escaped without white help. Try ancestry.com if your lost. It is sad about the past but no tears for the many whites enslaved by blacks? Blacks raided the European coast for some hundreds of years ensl<b> aved w</b>oman and boy<b> s fo</b>r sex and men to the galley or certain death. Please read the facts and research as you truly sound so ignorant. They were criminals! No they were fooled to believe! No, white man went into the jungles to capture them! No! Research you say? I have done more research in my life that you , your children and your parents combined have done. I have also traveled six continents as a soldier, mercenary, tourist. Get educated to facts and not your Afrocentric mi<b> ssion. N</b>othing against blacks child except the ones that teach stupidity and hate as you do.",

Blacks in Africa or whites in Europe made wars for gain to which they so profit. The <b> black </b>tribes preyed on others to profit for their sale and material gains. Yes your<b>  black</b> brothers sold blacks as th<b> e blac</b>k pimps se<b> ll wom</b>an on the streets to made profit. Most are not so horrible but it does not take a majority to make a horror. Slavery was a huge profit all the way to where they were going. I noticed the writer is from Ghana. Do your research and type in where does slavery exist. Slaves was not new to Africa and it still thrives. Of the 3 races it has be outlawed only in whites which were also the last to embrace it. Blacks had used\u00a0slavery power and pleasure from the start and to the present. Sometimes they cover it with the term \"indentured service\"\u00a0, Sudan and several west co<b> ast Afri</b>can nations still embrace it. The USA was the\u00a0second to outlaw it in the west after Canada which my Family is from and where many blacks sought haven. My heritage<b>  had not</b>hing to do with slavery at any time but so what as it happened. Try with your efforts to blame whites\u00a0for the suffering of which you never suffered and neither did your generations six times before you yet you cry as if you did!! Maybe put your BS to blame whites for something that ended 150 years by a 3% which counts the first slave owner in the USA who <b> was a </b>black man!! Try looking at the slavery in the home of your ancestors that continues today. When did you go to a Civil War Memorial to thank the thousands of whites that sacrificed their lives for the freedom of men? If you look around do you see anyone that can claim a slave owners heritage? Certainly not me! My family first<b>  saw a</b> black in the 1930's. Let me help you; look in the mirror and scream!! \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your article is totally subjective as is obvious to any reader except you! Never would be allowed if referenced as a proper source.

You know you are the one in denial and you should  stop being in denial about it. Your people first started slavery with the natives and when they saw that they were  dying because they were not strong enough, they decided to go kidnap Africans in Africa to enslaved them. The Natives and Africans nations were fonctionning very well, they had a gouverment, their society was well structured and everything, but you came and destroyed all of it because you think that you are the ones who should rule the world. This is how white people are. Couch potatoes and lazy asses who are always taking advantange of other people to do their dirty job and then have the nerve to claim out loud that they own and build everything.They caused all the pain, the suffering,  the trouble and  damages in this world and then blame the victims for a situation they put them in. The whole world is upside down because of you. You have to learn to hear these things more often so you can internize it to finally blame yourself for it. You have ripped us of everthing that we once were in Africa; our languanges, or<b>  african</b> names, our culture, our heritage.  You have distroyed our identity in order to control us better because when you don't know who you are, you are not in position to revendicate. You have raped us (men, women and children), sell us to other slave owners which lead to the separation of families living on the plantations, whiped us and then put salt or hot pepper (carribean) in our wounds, tie slaves women to  trees and wipped them and then put salt or hot pepper in their wounds, cut our foot when we tried to escape, beat us naked flat on the floor, almost starve us to death and then expect us to be strong enough to go pick up cotton or sugar canes in the fields, give us food in a animal feeder because you considered us as animals but treated them better than us, .....the list is very long I swear,  but I am going to stop there. And then, when the slavery has been abolished, you have started to han<b> g blac</b>k men who are the head of the family to trees, you created segregation, preve<b> nt bla</b>ck people to have rights that any white citizen would have, make laws that are not in our favor as subventionning schools that are in the suburbs, wrongly arresting, killing and emprison<b> ing bl</b>ack people and so on..the list is very long. In short, you hate<b>  the b</b>lack free ma<b> n and </b>woman and since the slavery has been abolished you have done everything that was in your power in order to opress them and preventing them to evolve as as society. You did everything to keep us at the hacker social ladder. It is a war of power, because if yo<b> u give</b> black people too much power, they might be in control of a white dominant society and this you don't want it to happen. Now that we are free, we  have became a threat for you.  If <b> one da</b>y black people find themselves as the ones in control of your society, you know that the US might become like another South Africa. And educated person like you should understand that and this is making you sweating bullets. The truth shall set us free and that is the reason why you are becoming so aggresive , outraged and enraged when you see that we are educating oursleves about our history . When you know your history you know who you are and when you know who you are you are aware of your identity and this awarness lead us to be in position where we can revendicate our rights. It is okay to remember the shoa, but it is not to remember the 400 years of slavery that your people have put us through. All the great revolutions in the world were made with weapons....and one day this revolution will be made in the suburbs..<b> ..by t</b>he black people of America. Have a great rape night.",

Blacks had it from the beginning of time and still practice it. Whites never kidnapped any blacks fool. Blacks captured blacks and sold them to the whites at the ports. Blacks hundreds of years prior captured free whites from Europe and made <b> sex </b>slaves out of the<b>  woman</b> and boys and to the galley for the men which was a short lived term. Whites lazy!! OMG!! I was an inner city teacher fool and try that on one that does not know and I live in an al<b> l blac</b>k are<b> a. Bla</b>ck as all over sitting and getting high. When I was t<b> hat </b>age I was always working. Your sadness gives me tears as you suffered so much. Your a pathetic lazy fool. You likely never had a real job. There are 196 nations in the world, 54 are in Africa, name which are technologically in the top 150 without any white support. Answer it or shut up. That should be easy to do.You are listening to trash and false thoughts.\u00a0 Africa has more slaves than the world combined today. Slavery was less than 80 years in the USA and less than 2% owned slaves. The average slave in the US was valued more than a new car today and you think they were hanging them? Free blacks in the USA; 1 in 4 owned a slave. the first slaves in the Americas were whites and the f<b> irst b</b>lack slave owners were blacks. The freed blacks that returned to Africa started slave worked farms. Most whites did not want slavery and the war to free them cost some 800,000 white lives. It reversed and blacks were the owners do you thing they would had do the same? NO!! 400 years of slavery my people put you through/ Are you so stupid . First again slavery lasted 77 years in the USA and not 400! Hell not so smart as you are the USA is only231 <b> year</b>s old now so how did we have slavery 400 years? My people? My people actually saw their<b>  first</b> black in the 1930's and slavery was long over. I think you will be a lonely person if you think they will attack and rape the white suburbs. Most blacks just do not agree with you child. White dominate society? Blacks are 13% of the population and we<b>  have </b>a black pr<b> esiden</b>t, black attorney general <b> and ha</b<b> >d a b</b>lack woman sec of state. Major<b>  citie</b>s are black mayors. I agree they are fucking everything up but still they did not <b> get th</b>ere on black votes fool. Hey educate yourselves if you wish to be stupid and the such and it makes you happy then go for it. Try researching where slaves are today. Disease and oppression of people. Do some studies about slavery and that should tell you how wrong you are.",

Acadian or Quebec French is the 17 th century French before the slang and butchery of the language but then you being <b> African </b>immigration would not know that. To be honest I was not aware google did a translation; interesting. I already told you (Of course your comprehension is weak so I understand) , my family did not see their first<b>  black</b> till the 30's. They are from Northern New Brunswick and East Quebec. No blacks there! The Duguay came to Canada in 1590 and Le Blanc in 1618 as explorers of France. I would not expect you would had heard of Rene Duguay from St Milo and one of France's great Admirals. My other side is to Field Marshal Rene Ney as in the \"Bravest of the Brave\", \u00a0to Napoleon. No I am not French American but first born USA. I see facts upset you. I understand as\u00a0if my roots were from Africa I would had left as well. As said reguardless I seriously doubt your blood is French except by transport<b> . Blac</b>k jealousy and so sad . It would be good if blacks would stop blaming whites for their social problems and start taking responsibility for their own actions. I noticed you still cannot answer the questions; it is okay as to do so would admit fault as so I understand. A population that outnumbers whites 4 to 1 and still brought blacks of their own to sell.<b>  A ra</b>ce that ruled the world<b> ! A r</b>ace without ships and ports but ruled the world and still could not rescue the blacks they sold. Too funny. I am older than you for sure child and I still remember the Boko Harem killing their own and raping them and even ate some. When they saw us moving in they ran as we killed many and the saved people loved us for it. Wonderful folks the Boko Harem were!! I cannot laugh at it as it was a horror beyond dreams the way they slaughtered children and innocent people. I suppose you should had moved to the Congo or Angola or maybe Uganda to speak to them!! Enough child as I have more urgent things to be doing and must plan my trip to SE Asia, I travel child and your safe where you are where ever that maybe.",

Yes you need an apostrophe when you're indicating missing letters. You clearly can't spell well, you use a comma when you're breaking up sections of a long sentence. It'd is short for it would. You're clearly lying because if you talk as you type you wouldn't be allowed to give a talk to nursery children let alone a learned audience.

                    "commentText": "+znieszka Unfortunately, America still has institutionalized <b> racism,</b> especially against Blacks. Being born, growing up & living in that atmosphere rubs off on you. You can't escape the overt/covert<b>  racism</b> because it's an everyday thing, so one becomes super sensitized to it! It's like being on guard all the time, wherever you go, even in your own community! In their own communities, many times if a group of youn<b> g blac</b>k men are just standing on the corner, they could just be laughing over a joke, they can still be profiled & harassed by police! Going into a store to purchase something can't even be an carefree experience, & I've experienced that many times! Mind you, I'm n<b> ot Afric</b>an American, but <b> I'm bl</b>ack & that's all some see, even those themselves whom aren't white! I've shopped at places where they were keeping an eye on me as if I were going to steal, I didn't let that intimidate me. I chose to spend my money, so I'll take however long I need to, idc, that's how I shop! Anyway, it's hard for anyone to live in those conditions, blacks have to do it everyday in the US! The media doesn't help either, in how blacks are portrayed to the world.",

A number of<b>  Black</b> Americans (including an older relative of mine who fought at Normandy) have testified to this over many decades. I try to point out to fello<b> w Blac</b>k Americans\u00a0that the situation might be different if they were North Africans, or even francophone Blacks from Mali or the Antilles.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once on my return from France in the lat 1980s I tried to publish an article on the situation of peoples of color in France with<b>  a Bla</b>ck American women's magazine known as ESSENCE. They rejected that article and (I later learned) a similar article b<b> y a Bl</b>ack American. But then they published another article talking about how grand life in France was<b>  for B</b>lack people. But I noticed that all those prosp<b> erous </b>Black people interviewed who found life so rewarding in Franc<b> e were</b> Black Americans. This prompted me and another brother I'd met over there to pen now angry letters to ESSENCE to set the record straight (as best we could considering we weren't French people of color), and to criticize the magazine for failing in its responsibilities.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I had been reading up on SOS, the National Front, the situation of North Africans and blacks beforehand. And while in France I took some time to talk to Francophone Blacks and North Africans, as well as talking to SOS people, and at least one philosopher connected at that time with LES TEMPS MODERNES. I also visited and spoke with persons connected with PRESENCE AFRICAINES.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So while I was not (and am not) an expert on these matters, I took some effort to try to inform myself rather than simply drawing conclusions based on my personal\u00a0\"experience\" as some naively do.\n\u00a0 One thing that stuck in my memory was that Francophone Blacks and Arabs seems to react to French police (and police to them) which was eerily like what I've seen here in the USA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But as for my own experiences in France they were quite benign. Hell, I enjoyed myself! I did feel like the we<b> ight </b>of race was off my shoulders in ways unimaginable in the USA.\u00a0I could see why an older relative who had fought at Normandy said he was tempted to stay in France and never r<b> eturn t<b> o </b</b>>Jim Crow America. Except for Frenchmen who dislike Americans, they were generally friendly. I can<b>  see h</b>ow a Black American can get an overly benign picture of France.\n\u00a0 No, France does have its pr<b> oblems </b>with racism.\u00a0 And from what I hear about the popularity of the National Front it could be worse than many imagine. But I've no evidence that France is WORST than others. In both France and the USA, the question is whether the democratic ideals of our two\u00a0societies will <b> prevail</b> over racism, or whether we shall enter into an era of fascistic oppression, barbarism and misery.",

She didn't specify anything about living in the past. What I seem to notice in Europe is that there is more of an historical consciousness over there than here--probably\u00a0 because they have more history. In America we tend to be historical amnesiacs, and in the words of Henry Ford to assume that \"history is bunk.\"",

But I wonder where you are from if you didn't know that there were middle clas<b> s Blac</b>k Americans. Even as\u00a0<b>  a bla</b>ck American schoolboy\u00a0I knew there were middle class blacks in the West Indies and Africa. I sometimes read W<b> est Ind</b>ian<b>  and Afr</b>ican thinkers like CLR James, George Padmore, Eric Williams, Kwame Nkrumah, Amilcar Cabral, Camara Laye, Frantz Fanon, Chinua Achebe, Nelson Mandela and others. In short, I\u00a0wanted to KNOW and to understand. Hence I inquired, and developed numerous friends among Africans and Caribbean people living in the USA. I can only be curious as to why you're not familiar with\u00a0some of our thinkers and writers; persons like W.E.B. Du Bois, Anna Julia Cooper,\u00a0Alain Locke, Richard Wright, Joy\u00a0James, James Baldwin, Paul Robeson, Langston Hughes, Angela Y.\u00a0Davis, Michelle Alexander, Manning Marable,\u00a0 bell hooks, Cornel\u00a0West and others I could suggest. For if you were so informed it would have been hard for you to have been unaware of the existence of an Ame<b> rican </b>Black middle class. And you'd probably also know how racial caste\u00a0in\u00a0America works such that \"whiteness\" is hegemonic; so much so that in the USA whiteness is taken (prereflectively) as being virtually\u00a0the norm of all that is right, good, beautiful and even human. Those who are identified with the norm often don't speak it,but rather simply assume it without even thinking about it. Those not identified with the norm, or even deemed the opposite of the norm\u00a0do not have\u00a0that privilege.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most Am<b> erican</b> black people know (or at least sense) that\u00a0they are the anti-thesis of the norm (even though some of us try\u00a0even today to assimilate to it).\u00a0 This is largely why the strug<b> gle fo</b>r black empowerment and liberation in America has been for more than just certain economic improvements, but rather has been from the very beginning a struggle for our humanity.\u00a0 I don't expect you to understand\u00a0this from day one.\u00a0 But if you choose to speak on it, it would be well if you took some time and effort to inquire and seek to understand.",

That's why when a<b>  black</b>/ gypsy/ maghrebian/ etc. became educated in the culture of their host culture, they are not discriminated anymore. In Europe, the blacks do not have this violent and this frustration against the dominant culture, so they are accepted with ease.\n.\nI can give you many examples of successfu<b> l blac</b>k people who are not discriminated anywhere.

Let me just do this as simple as possible.......\n\n1. Why dont <b> black </b>people live in africa anyway?\n\nMost of the<b>  black</b> population live in africa but there are many factors why some are in europe, here are a few\n\n-They were FORCED out of their country many years ago againts their will and they have finally settled in europe.\n\n-Because now everybody has the right to migrate for whatever reason they want to wherever.\n\n2. Why should they be all over the whites countries in the world?\n\n-Look at the answer in question one coz it basically answers it too.\n\n-whites were the one who forced them out and brought them to their own countries.\n\n-And dont flatter yourself they not only go to white countries but to any country they want to be because as i have said everybody has the right to migrate.\n\n(When you replied to my first comment you asked)\n\n3. tell me the reason why blacks have to mix into white countries and act like they are historically one of them calling themselves german, english, french?\n\n-Once again the answer in question one pretty much answers this.\n\nExtra explanation:\n\nThe original \"mixing\" happened when they were forced out of their country brought to yours and married to the whites, now their children are biracial. what determines wha<b> t rac</b>e they will be in \n\n1. Where they are born\n2. Where they live for the rest of their life.\n\nIf their child lives in france and adopts everything french plus the fact that he is half french then he is a frenchma<b> n, nothi</b>ng in him<b>  is bl</b>ack except his physical appearance, this applies even to those who are not biracial but was born and raised in france.\n\nI hope i have answered it now. Im sorry if i insulted you, i should have used nicer words. I reread what i wrote and i know i was rude. Your not ignorant, you are just asking, i get it.",

George Lopez (two shows), Modern Family, Jane the Virgin, plus even more in the media and music like Jessica Alba and Jennifer Lopez. The same with Asians, both\u00a0Daniel Dae Kim and\u00a0Yunjin Kim for television plus\u00a0Sung Kang and\u00a0Ming-Na Wen are big names in our films.\n\nThe US actually does represent al<b> l ethni</b>c groups not just blacks and not just whites no matter how little the demographic. We even have people from India and Polynesia making it successfully on tv programs.\n\nFace it, France has completely white washed their media. Other than Omar Sky and maybe Shy'm who do you have in the media that isn't white? Forget about entertainment, in France you don't even the basic representations for minorities like a tv reporter or journalist for the news. Si triste.",

Not only that but Blacks are expected to surpass Whites by 2050, so get used to it.\n\nMost of Europe is just afraid of change. Ethnocentrism seems to run wild, especially in France, and they try to hang on to what remains of their cultures even if that means keeping it Eurocentric at any costs.

Our cities are better than your cities, there is no real need for someone to go from Boston to New York on a daily basis so why would we make trains for it? Each city in the US can largely sustain themselves unlike 3 horse towns in Europe. In Europe you only have a handful of \"major\" cities and half of them have collapsed already anyway due to the economy. Without American tourism Europe would be in shambles. Half of Europe ARE tourists. To add insult to injury, Americans go for a country's past not their miserable current state. As far as trash I think it is London that has public toilets with hobos living in them and piss everywhere and Paris with dog shit all over the city ahaha. American cities are clean and uprising. Yes we do have a great army, and due to that we don't have fucking terrorists beheading people in our streets or in our offices lol.",

Fun fact, Anglophone <b> African </b>countries (Nigeria,Kenya,Ghana etc.) are doing much better than francophone countries (Mali, Senegal, Congo etc.). I don't want to write a paragraph to tell you why, but it has to do with the English educatiing the Africans during colonialism while the French kind of just swooped in for resources. I am not saying that the English were not wrong to colonize, but they did better things than the French that's for sure. I know this because I am Congolese myself and the French/Belgians fucked our country so bad. At the end of colonialism only like 10 people had University education of the 10s of million Congolese. Compare that to Ghana and Nigeria where the British actually sent thousands of them to study at British universities during colonialism. I am not trying to be mean but it seems like<b>  African</b> Americans are always commenting on vids they kno<b> w nothin</b>g about. Whenever I watch a video on American slave trade I ty<b> pe nothi</b>ng in comments because I am <b> not Afri</b>can American (i probably don't know that much to type a comment). This way I may not say something that is not true (this avoids offending people).",

You are right a dog is not part of the equidae(horse) family, so it is not a horse BUT unlike animals humanity is a part of only ONE family, the Human family and it does not matter where you are born or what color your skin is you're still human.\n\nI have never in my life heard of a more idiotic comparison and I'm only 14. French, Americans, Africans and all other races are all humans, we have these labels because we have different ways of living, so if an <b> African </b>is born in France and he lives as a french person he is<b>  African</b> french.

Sure in France there is <b> racism </b>but as everywhere and in particular because of the crisis. There are poeple who are<b>  racist</b> here I will not deny.\nI think the problem comes from both sides. I'm Tunisian and French and each year I come back to Tunisia (like a lot of Maghrebian) I really like my country but I can't live their because to find a job, gain money it's very difficult. There are black/arabs French who were born in France and have parents born in Africa, and say bad things about France, but they don't realize how lucky they are to live in a country like ours and I want to see them live there so they can see how life is more difficult than in France. But it's no their fault, they face an identity crisis.\nI'm verry Happy to live in France because there is real multiculturalism, There ar<b> e dum</b>b people who want to break it, says that it's a faibless but we have to go over and try to do our best for the coming years.\nSorry for my English I'm still learning.",

My ancesters from Egypt were not really nice people lol , they were invaders . they would invade a country , kill the men,\u00a0impregnate the women , and then less than a century later , the country was theirs .

Mario Datzit don't try saying Africa is the best place in the world because it's the last continent I would go visit.\nIt's true that Africa is the continent with most deaths due to diseases simply because they can't afford medicine, soap, good foods or water which cause them to have bad hygiene and bad overall health which make them prone to diseases. Not all<b>  African</b> people are poor but many are. It is well known for a fact that Africa is the poorest continent of the world. Actually, most diseases in Africa are those that can be prevented for less than $5 vaccine or with drugs that sell for less than $10.\nSexually Transmitted Diseases are a very big cause of death in Africa. With no prope<b> r sexua</b>l education of responsib<b> le sexu</b>al behavior and general access to condoms <b> the Afri</b>can are plagued by them. Sub-Saharan Africa bears the largest percentage of people being infected by STD's (like syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, hepatitis B, HIV) with a staggering 35+ million people infected.\u00a0\nAs for civil wars, like the south Sudan conflict, they cause tens of thousands deaths and even more homeless every year. They are also a very important cause of poverty. \ufeff\nThis is happening now, not in 1350 sorry to teach you that",

Lastly you should read history or simply do a Google search on who founded the continent of North America who built the cities that its people inhabit as well as the rule of law that is under said land, Then google search any and all <b> black </b>majority areas on this earth, Ill help! that is Africa, Haiti, Oakland California, New Orleans, part of Miami and lets not forget Washing DC to name a few. Now. Google \"crime rates\" as well as standard of living in these areas, Ya I wouldn't want to believe them either but sadly they are true... Good luck with that!",

Majority of Nigerians live lives as comfortable as any westerner but every negativity seems to be magnified by the international media so a lot of non-africans have it in mind that we live in this constant state of terror, and suffering! yes some of us are suffering, and that's awful, but to use that to define an entire country( CONTINENT even) is ridiculous!\n\nanyway, in relation to your statement, majority of Africans stay in Africa (and it's insane to think otherwise), yes there are those who live to seek better lives, but that is definitely true of all countries in the world; people constantly leave to seek better lives elsewhere, it's what humans do",

If you read up on history you'll find that the native Americans were very welcoming to the whites and offered to show them their ways to help them survive in the new land, and how did the white man repay them? By killing them, bringing their diseases and trying to assimilate the ones that remained and put them in little reserves (read up on residential schools in Canada) .

But though I am a citizen of the USA,\u00a0I don't decide who gets a passport and who does not. Unlike Jee, I don't wish that most of my compatriots be shot. I do wish that America was more given to honest self-examination. But as Afro-American writer James Baldwin once observed, most American will resort to almost anything to avoid self-examination. I wish that America would develop more of an historical consciousness, an historicist sensibility, and outgrow the immature condition of being what one American writer calls \"The United States of Amnesia.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0 But since Jee regrets that his countrymen (presumably whites) didn't pick their own cotton rather than importing my <b> African </b>ancestors,\u00a0perhaps he should also express regrets that they nearly exterminated the aboriginal people (misnamed \"Indians\") in order to seize the land on upon which the Africans would then be compelled to labor.

En anglais, free signifie gratuit et libre. La force de travail des esclaves \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre gratuite mais n'avait rien de libre. Et encore, loger et nourrir les travailleurs s'est av\u00e9r\u00e9, au XIXe si\u00e8cle, plus cher que de leur payer un salaire de mis\u00e8re, comme c'\u00e9tait le cas dans le secteur industriel. Ce facteur pris en compte, la force de travail des esclaves n'a rien de gratuit\u2026 Sinon historiquement ce que tu dis est vrai, m\u00eame si \u00e7a ne veut pas dire que les Wasps n'ont pas de dette envers les Noirs Am\u00e9ricains descendants d'esclaves)\u2026\n\nMy comment was just highlighting the double meaning of the English word \"free\", which made your sentence particularly awkward, not to say awful. In English, free means \"obtainable without any payment\" but also \"not imprisoned or enslaved.\" This workforce may have been free, but slaves could be everything but free. Also note that providing slaves with dwelling and food eventually became more expensive than just paying them a ridiculous salary, like industrial employers did at the time. Given this, the workforce was not economically free\u2026\u00a0\nOtherwise what you say is historically accurate, even if it does not mean that Wasp American have no debt to <b> African </b>American slave descendants\u2026",

It's very complicated explaining you what is going on in France if you don't know its background and culture but I will try to be succinct.\n\nThose attitudes you are talking about, the pro-nazism, is not growing. They are nonetheless very week and are not even tolerated on the public place. It is simply reemerging to the surface in period of deep political crisis.\n\nThe two stronger french political parties are lost in internal turmoils and confused in regards to the rapid changes provoked by globalization and new technologies, the country needs to change and <b> nobody </b>likes it.\nIt is very hard to predict a country's future in the actual international atmopshere, people lifestyle has changed a lot and will change a lot too. From this you can understand the political challenge our leader are confronted to.\n\nThere is one party in France which has been created several decades ago for pure political manipulation game. The party was used to fraction the right wing electorate, and it worked, the left won the election during this time. This party had a clear<b>  racist</b> ideology and used to be a mere political business for a family and its acolytes to sell pants and hatcheries to a ver<b> y dum</b>b crowd (less than 0.5% of vote for a very long time).\n\nTheir speech always ran on demagogic ideas like anti-immigration. Now that our fourth republic is weaken, and that the European project is making angry people (change always make people angry) they adapt their speech with anti-european, anti-globalization speech. they try to hide the<b> ir raci</b>st roots <b> but nob</b>ody gets fool.\nA lot of people voted for them during the last election not because they<b>  are ra</b>cist but in sign of protestation against the main right wings and left wing parties.\nAt the core they are not Nazis, but you can find some Nazis i<b> n it. N</b>obody in France could walk 1 meter sho<b> wing </b>a nazi cross, those people are very few but we cannot ignore them. If you<b>  have</b> 1 nazi for 100.000 people our society will focus on those roaches. It doesn't mean they are growing.",

The light skin/dark skin divide was actually created by the white\u00a0slaveholders, and continued for at least a century after slavery by certain practices of discrimination. My mother, a light\u00a0skinned <b> woman </b>from the<b>  Jim Cr<b> ow</b</b>> South, noted even\u00a0after moving North that often the few\u00a0\"better\" jobs available to Blacks were often advertised specifically for LIGHT SKINNE<b> D \"color</b>ed\" perso<b> n (\"colo</b>red\" <b> and \"N</b>egro\" being<b>  more c</b>ommon\u00a0names for American blacks in the 1950s & early 60s). In\u00a0a book called the COLOR COMPLEX, it was noticed that given the small privileges afforded to lighter skinned American Blacks it was generally\u00a0the case that most better educated and we<b> ll off</b> Black were light skinned. That is less true today than decades\u00a0ago,\u00a0but has not completely\u00a0 disappeared. What's harmful to Blacks is the extent to which Blacks--light , dark and in-between--have internalized the psychology of this \"colorism\" (as\u00a0it's sometimes called in the USA). It is emotionally harmful even if it doesn't divide politically the A<b> merica</b>n Black population as it has t<b> he South</b> African Blacks from the\u00a0\"coloreds\". Basically, the light skin/dark skinned divide--whereby value and beauty are increased the closer one is to white, and diminished the further one is from whiteness\u00a0(or closer to blackness)--is really an internalization w<b> ithin </b>the Black psych<b> e of wh</b>ite racism and Eurocentric aesthetics and values. This sickness was diminished but not e<b> nded b</b>y the Black consciousness movement during the 1960s in the USA.",

Mais je ne suis pas d'accord avec toi quand tu dis que le racisme entre noir est plus fort dans la communaut\u00e9 francophone africaine. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 plusieurs fois en afrique francophone, et j'ai jamais entendu des phrases racistes comme aux Etats-Unis. Je pense que c'est tellement un probl\u00e8me chez vous, que vous avez m\u00eame des mots comme \"colorisme\" qui existe et que nous n'avons pas dans notre langue.\nEn plus, certes, il y a du racisme en France, mais il n'est pas aussi fort, violent, et d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 que dans votre pays . Je suis n\u00e9e ici, et je n'ai jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9e ouvertement au racisme. Ni les gens de ma famille. Nous avons beaucoup de couples multiraciaux en France.\u00a0\nC'est vrai que beaucoup de jeunes noirs pensent que les Etats-Unis sont un pays beaucoup moins raciste que la France, mais c'est faux. L'actualit\u00e9 nous le prouve actuellement avec ce jeune noir qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 assassin\u00e9 par la police. Ce genre de faits-divers n'arrive que tr\u00e8s rarement en France.\nMais je te remercie de ta r\u00e9ponse qui m'aide a comprendre le racisme entre noirs aux etats-unis.",

                    "commentText": "@Peacewithchildren What I'm talking about may be more <b> common </b>among Francophone Blacks from the West Indies. The experience of Blacks from Martinique, to take one example, is in a sense similar to that of\u00a0Blacks of the USA. They, like we, are descendants of Africans deported during the slave trade. And what we sometimes call \"colorism\" in the USA, began in the French\u00a0Caribbean (like in the USA) during slavery. That divide was imposed by the whites. However, while the French (at least after slavery) offered the carrot of assimilation, in\u00a0the USA segregation was the standard policy--and remains a FACT (no longer the law) even today in the USA. Colorism may have been intensified in the French territories because the ideology of assimilation promised you could gain equality, escape racial inferiority by assimilating French values, language, etc. In short, by becoming white. The mentally colonized<b>  Black</b> American often also wanted to be assimilated, to become white, but was made to\u00a0know in no uncertain terms that he was not welcome--not even with a Harvard U Ph.D. and mastery of the King's English and a\u00a0dozen other\u00a0European languages.\u00a0 Largely for this reason <b> a Blac</b>k person as \"color struck\" as martiniique's Mayotte Capecia (as is evident in her work \"Je suis Martiniquaise) would be unusual in the USA. The very bluntness of Americ<b> an raci</b>sm compared to a more nuanced and subtle Fre<b> nch rac</b>ism would likely jolt an Amer<b> ican B</b>lack back into consciousness. Perhaps that's why our Harlem Renaissance preceded\u00a0 Francophone Negritude.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Africa, I'm not as sure. French colonialism did seduce Africans with the policy and ideology of assimilationism, But unlike both the Martiniquais and Les Americains Noires<b> , the Af</b>rican is not uprooted from his/her land and cu<b> lture. </b>Mental colonialism (of which colorism is one feature) may not be as deeply rooted in as many people as in the French Caribbean. But I'm pretty sure that it existed because I'<b> ve read </b>African writers who talk about it. But it may have affected ma<b> inly the</b> African elites, and less so the masses. And the condition may not run as deep.",

Even the way you presented Assimilationism is kind of the Caribbean caricatural/simplified version. In France we don't really have this light skin VS dark skin thing you have in English countries, only Caribbean think like this in my own experience. Some Congolese and Senegalese do light skinning tho but they generally grew up in Africa and are uneducated.\u00a0\nI also think your vision of France is too politicized and too clich\u00e9, like the fact to see<b>  racism</b> everywhere. Don't forget that the late 80's were very unique and kind of shitty for immigrants because of the political context (Mass immigration and massive regularization of illegals, one of the first to happen in Europe). You<b> r Blac</b>k French friends don't represent a<b> ll Bla</b>ck French, and don't forget also that culturally we complain much more in France than in other Western countries.

                    "commentText": "Hi there blackmaxpayne. Yeah, it seems the \"journalist\" was trying very hard to make it look like a flagrant statement of typical French <b> racism.</b> Now that painting on the pub window was merely depicting both the French and American presidents putting aside their countries' mistrust towards each other (ref. to Gulf Wars and stuff) and joining forces for a better world, unknowing of the fact that the world was supposed to come to its end on 12/21/2012 (the little devil getting ready to explode the world is supposed to represent a Mayan devil). It's not so<b>  common</b> today as it used to be, but many pub/caf\u00e9s/restaurant/brasseries owners like to decor their windows on special occasions, like Xmas/NYEve, summer holidays, intn'l foot/rugby competitions, even Halloween and Paddy's Day; and usually do it with a comic or merely \"merrying\" rendering. That was clearly the case with that particular restaurant; and it pisses me off when someone takes it as an excuse to yell<b>  \"Racis</b>m!\" when there's none. He was t<b> he raci</b>st here (ex., his racists comments about a graffiti depicting Maurice Chevalier [a white French singer from WW2 era, clearly unknown to the journalist] and pretending it was an insult towa<b> rds bl</b>ack people).",

Especially America and some European countries. Africa, which is a CONTINENT NOT A COUNTRY, is always seen as the poorest \"country\" in the world. Yes, they some very poor places in Africa, just like there are very poor places in every country/continent in the world. They are also middle class and rich places in Africa. Aside from that, In the olden daysAmerica and many European countries enslave<b> d Africa</b>n countries and basically destroyed those countries foundation. Thats why Africa is seen as \"behind\" in their development as a continent. Fast forward to present day, those Europeans and Americans look down on Africans and their descendents resulting <b> in raci</b>sm. I h<b> ate rac</b>ism no matter if its directed to Africans, Asians, Caucasians, or whatever. It's wrong. Keep in mind though that I'm not saying EVERY American or Europea<b> n is ra</b>cist or that America and Europe are terrible places.That would be rude and incorrect. I'm just saying that that's most likely one of the reason why the<b> re is r</b>acism in those countries. Sorry for such a long comment. :)",

En france, les deux notions sont tr\u00e8s li\u00e9es, vu les amalgames que les gens font tout le temps.\n\nPersonnellement, je suis d'orgine camerounaise et j'ai v\u00e9cu en France toute ma vie. De ce que je constate dans les m\u00e9dias et la vie au quotidien, les personnes non-blanches doivent soit \u00eatre quasiment invisble (ou loin dans leurs quartiers sp\u00e9ciaux), soit si elles sont visibles, ne pas s'identifier en tant que noire ou autre en mode \"on ne voit pas la couleur\" etc. Le racisme en France est non seulement subtile mais syst\u00e9matique. On a plus de chance de se faire arr\u00eater par la police quand on est arabe ou noir, plus de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 l'embauche, les boites de nuit, les contr\u00f4les dans les transports etc.. Plus les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s et les id\u00e9es re\u00e7ues qui sont bien ancr\u00e9es dans les esprits.\n\nEt oui, il n'y a qu'\u00e0 lire un journal ou voir une \u00e9mission de t\u00e9l\u00e9 ou m\u00eame parler avec les gens pour voir que c'est souvent consid\u00e9r\u00e9 (en dehors des cercles o\u00f9 les gens savent appr\u00e9cier) comme un sous-genre de musique, seulement pour les jeunes et avec peu ou pas d'int\u00e9r\u00eat musical. La condescendance avec laquelle les gens traitent le rap en France frise le ridicule parfois. Et nous savons tous que c'est une musique particuli\u00e8rement associ\u00e9e aux miniorit\u00e9s ethniques donc on voit o\u00f9 les gens veulent en venir.",

But I was concerned when I heard Blacks and North Africans complaining about <b> racism.</b> In the\u00a01980s when I was a student, Blacks here in the States had become aroused by the fight against apartheid in\u00a0South Africa, and then word had gotten back to some of us about the National Front. Some<b>  Black</b> American newspapers and magazines asked me to inquire to see what I might find. I must admit that I felt the burden o<b> f rac</b>e far less in France than in the USA.\u00a0 And I h<b> ad eld</b>er relatives who fought in WWII, one at Normandy, and who thought that France was almost paradise compared to our KKK-ridden and segregation bound society. (Richard Wright once said that there was more freedom in one block of Paris than in the whole of the USA).\u00a0\u00a0But talking to Tunisians, Malians, Martiniquais and others gave me a different and more sobering picture. I couldn't help noticing that many white French who were friendly to me were quite unfriendly and even hostile to francophone Blacks. Yet I didn't see the marks of segregation so commonplace in the USA that we Americans have\u00a0ceased noticing it here. I also saw a degree of social mingling between Blacks and whites in Paris that exceeded even what one would find at that time in the largest and most liberal of American cities. And then there was the anti-racist group called SOS and their inscriptions \"touche pas mon copain.\" That, at least, was encouraging.\u00a0 As I was telling a friend recently visiting from Paris \"At least your country doesn't have an INGRAINED tradition of racial caste and segregation that we have in the USA, and which even the Movements of the 1960s couldn't fully dislodge. If you are determined to <b> end rac</b>ism in France you may find it much easier than we will in the USA.\"",

He doesn't seem to accept that he's dealing with a different culture quite different from his American experiences. While there is some <b> racism,</b> it's not as extreme and rigid as it is in the States. People are actually more open.And his comment,\"Oh I have<b>  Black</b> friends\" was totally unnecessary. Sorry dude, trying to apply American stereotypes",

So you're going to have to decide which is more important; being Politically Correct or alive?",

Asians complaining about Asians outnumbering them is ridiculous. When White people complain about being outnumbered they're not Italians who are referring to being outnumbered by Germans or Pols. But DIFFERENT races of people entirely. In some places in the U.S. ala New Orleans, El Pasa, non-White people literally outnumber the Whites.",
