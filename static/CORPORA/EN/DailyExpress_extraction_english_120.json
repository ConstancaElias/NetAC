        "postText": "The corporation sparked a backlash for upholding a complaint against the Breakfast presenter for criticising remarks made by President Donald Trump. An executive then seemed to blame co-host Dan Walker, 42, for leading her into talking about her own experience of racism. Mr Phillips said: \u201cThe minute they have to deal with the question of race, they go into a mental paralysis.\u201d', 'The BBC found Ms Munchetty, 44, of Indian and Mauritian heritage, had breached guidelines after attacking the US president\u2019s remarks that four female opposition politicians of colour should \u201cgo back\u201d to the \u201ctotally broken and crime-infested places from which they came\u201d.', 'Black media figures including Sir Lenny Henry and Adrian Lester wrote a joint letter protesting against the decision.', 'Some BBC colleagues defied bosses by publicly voicing support for Ms Munchetty.', 'The BBC found she was wrong to give her opinion on Mr Trump\u2019s motive. She is not facing any disciplinary action or a reprimand.', 'Yesterday Mr Phillips said that director general Lord Tony Hall should rescind the judgment and stop managers warning staff discussing the issue or signing petitions was a breach of its code of conduct.', 'The former Equality and Human Rights Commission chairman said Ms Munchetty had simply been carrying out her journalistic duties.', '\u201cThe corporation above everything else needs to apologise to this journalist.', '\u201cThey followed the process absolutely precisely and did the bureaucratic thing to the tee and came out with a decision that was so completely mad and wrong and undermined the BBC\u2019s own journalistic values.\u201d', 'He said that Westminster correspondents often gave an opinion on politicians\u2019 motives.', 'Sir Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote said: \u201cShe has not done anything wrong. The BBC has got itself in a right mess.', '\u201cThe BBC needs to be big enough and say we don\u2019t always get it right and on reflection when someone like Trump makes repeated remarks, it is fair to suggest they are racist or their motive may be racist.\u201d', 'Yesterday BBC colleague Andrew Marr tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m a massive admirer of Naga, and I think she\u2019s behaved with great courage, grace and calmness.\u201d', 'Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis said the BBC risked looking \u201cmassively out of touch with the real world\u201d for saying it was right to call out racism but wrong to say Trump was a racist.', 'Dark Materials novelist Sir Philip Pullman said: \u201cShe\u2019s right and they\u2019re wrong.\u201d', 'As the row raged after the initial findings, with the BBC finding itself accused of racism and sexism, senior bosses including Tony Hall wrote a letter to staff claiming Ms Munchetty was \u201cjustified\u201d in speaking out.', 'Then BBC editorial policy director David Jordan brought co-host Walker into the row, saying it could be said that he led Munchetty to the conclusion she eventually made.",

You don't need to be a 'university graduate' since you're interested to see that there is a problem in telling people to go back to the places from which they came, when for three of them, the place from which they came is the US. They have the same status as Trump himself, i.e American citizens born and bred, of overseas ancestry. Picking up on Trump  when he makes a fool of himself like that has nothing to do with a 'hate agenda'.",

Do you expect Democrats to say. 'Yes, Mr Trump, your policies are right'? Not how politics work, is it. Trump and the Republicans would attack a Democrat government in similar fashion, but it would be absurd for him to be told to go back to Scotland or Germany, where his ancestors came from.  You seem to have a problem with 'countries of origin'. The women are just like Trump - born and bred in the US, of overseas ancestry.",

Of course, if she'd said 'I think Trump was right and justified in what he said', you would be praising her and saying she should get promotion.",

As for your experience as a teacher, well then the system failed you.I am sure you should have fought harder for justice, or maybe you have unconscious bias and what you would have accepted from a white kid you won 't with a  Muslim kid.  All of this is perfectly acceptable to talk about, I don' t know where you get the idea it isn 't!  what you can't do is say all blacks, all Muslims, all white are...\u2026Now if you are intelligent, that isn 't difficult to do!",

Three of them are just like Trump himself: American citizens born and bred, of overseas ancestry, so it clearly makes no sense to tell them to 'go back from where they come', does it? Even the fourth one got American citizenship as a child. Trump was absolutely wrong, and made an idiot of himself again. You really mustn't let your extreme prejudices conceal recognition of the facts.",
