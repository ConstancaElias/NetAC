        "postText": " SUBSCRIBE for more videos Toolkit Sexism Questions: What are examples of everyday sexism, both of the major and micro-aggression variety, you see in your life? What about in the media? Who do you think of when you think of heroes? Role models? What impact do superheroes have on your life? Do you see superheroes as role models? Do you feel like there are superheroes that you can relate to/you can see yourself in/reflect your identity? Is it important to see characters that reflect your identity? Who is your favorite female MCU character? What female characters (in the MCU or outside of it) do you consider to be heroes? Role models? What about outside of fiction? Do you see any of the personal or professional issues these characters face as women reflected in your own life? What issues do you think most affect women in your community, whether personally or professionally? Do you feel that you can contribute something to help alleviate these problems? What would you need in order to be able to? Many people use the Bechdel Test as a standard for measuring the representation of women in a film. Which Marvel films or shows pass the Bechdel Test? Which do not? Does the Bechdel Test accurately show the representation of women in that piece of media? Explore some other standards for measuring representation of women in media. Do you feel these are more useful? What does the simplicity of the Bechdel Test (and the inability of so many films to pass it) say about poor representation of women in media? The MCU has been criticized for only having one female-led project (Agent Carter) in comparison to its many male dominated films. Why do you think female-led projects are important? Agent Carter has also been critiqued for its lack of inclusion of people of color. How does this represent the importance of intersectionality? How do Agent Carter's shortcomings reflect the shortcomings of mainstream feminism in regards to the support of and inclusion of women of color? What female characters in comics do you think should be added to the MCU? Do the comics do a better/worse/about the same job on representation as the MCU? Why? What do you think the MCU does right in its treatment of female characters? What does it do wrong? Sometimes female fans are excluded from certain nerdy things due to the myth of the fake geek girl. What are some examples of this? Is it important for fandom to be open to everyone? What can be done to help alleviate this problem?

            "commentText": "7:03 the transformative side of fandom is seen as mainly for girls because historically it's mainly been women who were contributing with writing and art etc in fandom. Most fanfic writers are women, a lot of the most popular fan artists are women, most Shippers in my experience are women, etc. That's why it's seen as a female things cuz it's a female dominated side of fandom. It's really cool to see women be the majority in some areas, hoeveee I do agree it's not the best that we see transformative works as female only as there are a lot of male and non binary fans who do the same who get misgendered either accidentally or who don't get the same visibility. With transformative works, it's all about the message or the storytelling skills etc and that's what really needs to shine through. As a male artist in fandom, I feel almost like I connect more with female fans than with male fans specifically because of the amount of transformative works produced.",

On one hand, out of the 14 MCU movies released so far, 12 had a straight white man as the lead character, and 2 were ensemble movies about a group of heroes consisting of 5 males and just 1 <b> woman.</b> MCU has been going on for 9 years, and they are only now going to have a movie with a<b>  black</b> lead and another one with a female lead.\nOn the other hand, out of 2 MCU network shows and 3 Netflix shows so far, 2 have had a female lead, 1 has <b> a blac</b>k male lead, 1 has a white male lead whose character <b> is disabl</b>ed, and 1 is an ensemble show where half of the main characters are women (just like in the actual human population) and that focuses equally on men and women, and that has one of the most ethnicalky/racially diverse casts on TV.\n\nThat's one of the reasons I prefer MCU TV shows to movies. The other is that MCU TV is generally less formulaic and less predictable and takes more risks, and all the shows have been very distinct and different from each other.",

I've seen criticism towards Agent Carter that says there are few women and people of color (I agree on this, however we must remember the actress who plays the protagonist is half Native American). I have to say that Marvel TV representation is better than Marvel movies (I'm dying for a bisexual Capitan America). Keep doing your awesome work <3",

Representation helps so many people come to terms with their sexuality and feel like they're not alone - if I was exposed to more representation as a kid I would've spent so much less time hating myself for ny sexuality and coming out to myself. Until I was 11, because of a lack of representation, I had only heard the word 'lesbian' or 'gay' used as an insult and thought it was a dirty word. In pretty much every movie there is a straight couple, and that is how it should be for us in the LGBTQ+ community too. No hate intended, you are entitled to your opinions, just trying to show the other side :)",

I'm surprised that people find it okay, because if the idea of the X-men is to point out unjust discrimination against a non-threatening demographic, you can't really use a group of people with incredible powers who do pose a legitimate threat to humans as an allegory for that. \n\nAlong those same lines, people seem to think that it's appropriate to use supernatural creatures as allegories for <b> racism,</b> and that also doesn't work because again when it boils down to it, vampires and werewolves (two supernatural monsters that are linked to animals) and other paranormal entities do pose a threat to humans and they can and do harm humans because it is an inherent part of their nature. If the purpose of a work is to prove a point that<b>  racism</b> and oppression and discrimination are wrong and being lopsidedly utilized against a minority, the message is sort undercut when you use aggressive, hypersexual, animalistic MONSTERS or a group of superpowered beings whom parts of their identity are derived from a GENETIC MUTATION as a substitute for the LGBTQ+ and/or POC communities.\n\nIt also doesn't help the fact that many of the most well known and most often portrayed characters are white or at least white passing.",

The comics do have <b> que<b> er </b</b>>characters, major female characters, people of color, and other marginalized characters that don't make it into the films (or are sidelined/diminished when they do). I also liked your discussion on \"male vs female\" ways of expressing fandom - I'd never thought of that before, but you're right - it seems like men dominate the collecting, trivia, game night side of fandom while females dominate fan-fiction, fan-art, etc.",

Maybe it's harder for people who are constantly represented to understand, but it means a lot to have a more diverse set of characters, includes more people's ideas, and opens up many more stories and perspectives so that (I for one) feel a lot more a part of the stories. They are putting themselves in a box with the cis, straight males being the only thing they tell stories about. It's enriching not limiting. :) I think you just need to stop thinking of it as bad thing or a chore. It's just making the world more realistic/improving the story and including more fans in it on a more personal level :)",

            "commentText": "As a female I honestly don't feel like I'm able to even wear anything themed otherwise I could be regarded as being fake and would have to defend why I'm wearing that particular item. I didn't grow up with access to comics. It is insanely hard to know where to start when it comes to comics if you know no one who has any to lend you. I LOVE X-men. Have I read all the comics? No. I have the first 2 omnibuses, I have seen all the films, I own all of them - DVD and bluray ((The exception being days of future past). I love the 90's X-men cartoons, X-men Evolution, Wolverine and the Xmen. I know more about Xmen than anyone else I actually know. So why do I feel uncomfortable identifying as an X-geek when I so clearly want to? In fact, the only two Fan Tees I could ever wear were my pink Storm one - the only pink thing I have ever loved wearing, BUT I always coupled it with a waistcoat so obscure the image a little (Also waistcoats are awesome) and my Hufflepuff Tshirt - because I actually grew up with Harry Potter and I like to defend Hufflepuff. I feel Solidarity with Hufflepuff. (Also I did a lot of Text based RPGs that were HP themes from the ages of 12- ~16. Although I was into Ravenclaw back then).\n\nI own SO MANY Fan Tees. I even had one made for my friend and I saying \"Get the Cheese to Sickbay\", a relatively obscure Voyager reference. I can't even find them anymore. They are probably in storage despite me loving them. Everything online has basically told me that if I can't recite all the facts about something then I'm not a true fan. That I haven't earned the privilege of wearing those clothes. This is, of course, ridiculous. I can go out without makeup, looking like a complete scruff and I don't care. As soon as I wear a tshirt showing something I love I become super aware of it and super shy. I know this is a minor point, but it links in to the \"fake Geek/ gamer girl\" image. I don't feel like I can call myself a gamer, just like I don't feel like I can call myself a geek because I feel that as a female I suddenly have to represent all females and if I fail a test of knowledge/skill I have let all females down.\n\nOf course, this isn't true, and it is SUPER insulting to everyone around me. But this is a huge voice yelling at me from the internet telling me that I'm not geeky enough or good enough at games to identify as anything.\n\nI Love the Marvel Films. Have I seen every film? No. I didn't see The Hulk for example. I haven't read any of the comics. This is another thing I see a lot online: If you've only seen the films then you're not a true fan. I want to tell people to shut up - if you enjoy something you're a fan. These attitudes exclude people, even if you know how silly those standpoints are.\n\nI suppose you could say that because things like Marvel, X-men and DC are decades <b> old,</b> back when comics were stereotypically a male thing, it feels as though \u00a0you have to have Hard fandom evidence to support yourself and know all the facts to be considered a \"true fan\". This is lesser (though still exists) in more modernly created fandoms like Harry Potter. Seen the films? Liked them? You're a fan! Read the books? bonus! Not read Magical Beasts and where to find them? No problem! \u00a0Perhaps that this is because there were more females around who could enjoy them in a way seen as socially acceptable in those fandoms to help shape them, whereas \u00a0stereotypes back in the 70's (eg when the Thor comics began) it was seen as a less acceptable pass time for females?\n\nI don't even know what I am trying to say anymore. I suppose just that even though fandoms ARE changing, including the older ones like DC and Marvel, just the idea of \"Fake\" (especially female) fans are massively damaging to confidence and growth of that community as a whole.",

                    "commentText": "@Lexi B\u00a0I grew up with games in my house. My mum played Tomb Raider. I didn't always actually get to play, and I had a few years of depression where I don't think I really played at all.  But in my 23 years of life I have mostly been surrounded by games which I have enjoyed, yet because I haven't played X Game or because I don't play Y hours a week or have Z skill level I don't acall myself a gamer. There are no rules so it feel ridiculous. Again, I feel like I have to represent all females for some reason and I don't want to do that (I actually made a video on this June 2014).\n\nAlso, there were 2 reasons that I know of why the publishers wanted Max to be female: 1) Her name is based on a Male Character from Catcher in the Rye (Yet Thor as a female seems to be working out pretty well so why is this a problem?) 2) They seem to think that Female protagonists don't sell well (I am more likely to buy a game if I think that there is a decent female protagonist. Also At least BloodRayne was deemed good enough to make a series. Oh. Who am I forgetting? Lara Croft? Nah, it's not like she is super successful or anything.\n\nWhat I like about Don'tNodEntertainment (Who also made Remember me and got a load of Crap about Nilin being female) is that they don't make characters female to make a point. Their protagonists are female because that was their \"vision\". To me this signifies reduced <b> sexism </b>more than adding females to make games more representative. Games reflect society - or at least gaming society. So I do believe that as a whole, games are becoming less sexist. Also, Chloe and Max being so different both physically and in personality - YAY! WE HAVE VARIETY PEOPLE. (Although I can't recall much<b>  ethnic</b> variety).\n\n\nWhat I HATE is when guys say \"So, I'm a Dude and I don't mind playing as girls. There are loads of games you can play as a girl!\" I think this is because when you are adequately represented then you don't feel the need to be represented. When you're not, you want to be. Only 15% of playable characters are female. 15%. Yeah, there is a BUTT load of games out there, so 15%= a buy load of games is a lot of games you COULD play. But 15% representation isn't great, especially when females are at least (but I think more) 50% of the world's population.\n\n\n\n\nOne excuse is that \"We can't work out how female's walk and display it well\". This is a weak excuse. For one thing you've had more practice with guys. More female characters would result in more practice and you'd work it out! Girls don't walk THAT differently to guys. Oh, look, Sony figured it out ages ago with LARA CROFT. Hmmm, the Resident Evil series do seem to be doing well (although these games seem to have breast wobble/ size... indicators as to the developer's preferences, so I suppose females are seen a<b> s sexua</b>l objects still).\n\nDon't people consider it a problem that off the top of my head I can only think of a few female protagonists, and I had to recycle my examples?",

                    "commentText": "@Lexi B\u00a0I have been super lucky in life knowing all the people that I know.\n\nThe Resident Evil series has generally been really good at having a good male:female ratio (Usually each person has a partner of the opposite <b> sex)</b>, but they also have diversity within their women. Jessica is flirty, for example, Jill is a bit more business like (but can still have fun). I'm a little torn on whether they still seem to indicate that women are<b>  sex</b> objects. Jessica's personality is flirtatious, but SOME WOMEN ARE, so that's fune. Jill has big boobs, Moira, Claire and Jessica have smaller breasts. YAY DIVERSITY! it makes sense that they are wearing wetsuits which are form fitting. But their costumes don't make sense. The BSAA CAN AFFORD TO GIVE THE UNIFORM AND FITTED WETSUITS! There is no reason why Jill wouldn't be able to do hers up over her cleavage. But then, wetsuits are probably annoying to have all they way done up. She could have undone it a little for comfort. Jessica has an entire leg out. I don't know how that thing didn't freeze off! BUT she was trying to seduce Chris and she IS flirty and both of those probably had an impact on her choice. Rachael though. Rachael. In what world would anyone on a mission to fight bioterrorists undo their wetsuit to below their bellybutton? Now, she was ill, so it is possible that she undid it to cool off, to make herself feel better, but it's still undone when you can play as her in Raid mode. They did treat Sheva awfully. Always zooming in on her boobs or breasts with some excuse such as her gun or she is \"infront of the imaginary camera\". Do they do this to Chris? No. But they DID super beef up his arms to alarming levels. So, guys are sexualised alittle too, but NOT as much as females, which is why I regard Chris and Jessica as sexualised, which means it is at an acceptable level, but Rachael is oversexualised, It's too much. Although she is great in Raid mode. Now, I know a lot of this only makes sense to people who have played Resident Evil, and I do seem to bee focusing on revelations 1 here, and that's because I don't think the previous games were TOO bad. Ada was sexy, but not overly so. Jill has big boobs, Claire does't - variety is good. But I do have another point here: Christ gets a sailor outfit with short shorts. On a female this would be considered as  sexy. On a guy, it has a comedic effect. Why? Because society has conditioned this. And that is NOT RE's fault. But it does make me wonder if they put Rachael in specifically to show the contract of what they could have done with female characters (though I doubt it).\n\n\n\nIf you're looking for a good Free to Play game, Neverwinter is excellent. You seriously do NOT have to pay to win. The best armor and weapons you EARN. The only better things that you get that you pay for are FASTER mounts (You can still get mounts) and some companions - although you can save up for some of the best companions with in game currency. The Cat is my favourite. And the Dragon. I had to be SUPER stingy with my astral diamonds to get them! It has to make in game sales so it can afford to run, but it still does it's best to keep things fair and balanced. Also it is a super accepting community. It's no big deal if you're female. If you make a mistake no one says that you're entir<b> e se</b>x is a failure. You know why? 1) plenty of females play. YAY! 2) I have a theory that the more female characters there are (whether NPc or PC) the less they stand out. If they don't stand out then no one makes a big deal over them and no one overly sexualises them. I've noticed that if there is only one female character then people will nitpick like \"Wow, look at her boobs\" or \"Don't you think her ass <b> is wei</b>rd?\". If there are women characters everywhere you tend to ignore them and go about your mission.\n\n\nLike, 50% of gamers are female. There have been so many studies showing this. If you look at steam stats, like, 50% of accounts are from people who identify as female. (If you have a steam account you should totally add me: Railuki)\n\n\nI know what you mean. I have ALWAYS had a bias to play as female characters, even when I was little. Fighting games? I played Nina in Tekken (Till my brotehr banned fe from her because First thing in a fight I would always panda claw him to the ground and keep kicking him so he remained stun locked) or Talim in Soul Calibre. Also they are speed characters and I prefer speed characters. In Resident Evil Revelations 2, there are 3 main female characters to 1 male. YAY. In raid mode you unlock characters from other games, or minor characters from that game. Slightly smaller proportion of females, but suddenly I don't mind playing males so much!\n\n\nFor all I'm complaining, I DO think that things are starting to change\n\n\n\nAs for the walls of text, I am doing the same thing XD",

I'm not against storylines like this but I also like to see characters who don't just struggle with this.\u00a0\n(And what I often hear (from white cis-guys) is \"But I think it really sucks to add a <b> black </b>guy just for the purpose of being PC.\" Ugh.)\nLoved the video!

I think similarly to other underrepresented groups, it's that line between acknowledging negative experiences and creating a picture of something more complex... I suppose Agent Carter would be walking the line between totally ignoring the place of PoC in America at the time to give side characters a better arc than that, and being true to their experiences, if that makes sense.  Because I think the Cap films mainly ignored the Howling Commandos ethnicities, but it sort of ignored most oppression so that wasn't out of place... but AC is so focused on it, it would almost seem like a flashing light to include PoC and not mention it, if that makes sense?",
