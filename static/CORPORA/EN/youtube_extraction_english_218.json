Not just online white people<b>  face r</b>acism and also any other types of people throughout world however they look.\n\nBefore civilised society most tribal groups from all over the world attacked other tribes and took slaves this continued up until the modern era's until it was out-lawed in agreement by all \"civilized\" countries across the world. Now we have c<b> ertain</b> black people us<b> ing t</b>he race card as a weapon/tool for political influence and certain white people agreeing with them out of some unfounded guilt and are being used and manipulated. They themselves haven't committed a crime but bare the sentence charged of slavery.\n\nEspecially in my country the UK the poorer white working class natives of the Island are being blamed for slavery even though it was the Royal Families and people with money who had industry throughout the world who were to blame for these practices but they are held up with high respect because they have money, fancy clothes, fancy cars, mansions etc and the same types of people today are using immigration for cheap labour and they are praised.\n\nT<b> he hu</b>man race talking about morality is just a political game and the ones at the moment who look the most clean are the most dirty.\n\nCertain people want to be around other certain people, let everyone have what they what without conflict, it's possible, stop forcing a decision to choose to be either this party or this party.\n\nStop beating around the bush and accept people want to be around different people and have different beliefs, we aren't all the same and never will be, we all deserve the right to live our lives in peace.",

If you actually look at statistics, the most <b> common </b>hair color for whites is brown, not<b>  black</b>. Very few white people actually have naturall<b> y blac</b>k hair(besides Southern Europeans, who generally have some admixture from the Middle East and North Africa). Second, Central Asians don't have the highest concentration of redheads in the world. Scotland does, with Ireland being a close second, and the United States being third. Also, green eyes is most prevalent in Northern Europe. The Afghan girl on the National Geographic cover is the rare exception, not the rule. The main reason she's on the cover is because it's not ve<b> ry comm</b>on for her people to have light eyes.",

Is that a south Asian trait? Judged for beauty by westerners, a south East Asian beauty might get lower marks for not showing  as much brazen confidence.  Just some ideas.",

It's sad that even in India, beauty contest winners always seem to be the whitest. There may be social economic factors at play here.

Most times you get slammed the door into your face in online dating. \nIt's like the video says they don't take even a closer look and swipe away instantly because you don't fullfill their idea.\nAnd even in real life you may get in touch with a lot of <b> woman </b>but you won't get over a certain line. I wouldn't ever consider the vast majority as even remotely<b>  racist</b> but it something deeply ingrained in the subconciousness.\nThis beauty ideal for whiteness isn't just in white people but every othe<b> r rac</b>e seems to be infected too with it.

There are reasons for this:\n\n1. Most white men are not very attracted to<b>  black</b> women. In fact, even mos<b> t blac</b>k men find white & asian women to be more attractive th<b> an bla</b>ck women.\n\n2. M<b> ost bl</b>ack women are not very attracted to white or asian men.\n\n3. SJW white chicks in<b> vite b</b>lack guys to use of their vaginas & rectums as a method of \"reparations\" for slavery & atone for their unearned \"white privilege\". \n\n4. Masochistic white girls have figured out that there are a l<b> ot of </b>black guys out there who hate white people, but will happily fuck white girls while treating them like shi<b> t.\n\n5.</b> Black men, on average, have very slightly larger penises than white men. That said, white guys on average have very slightly larger penises than asians, & there are still very large numbers of white guys in Europe & North America who have dicks larger than the <b> averag</b>e black guy simply because whites are temporarily still in the majority (for the time being).",

The quality of your society has been made possible due to the colonisation of massive amounts of resource rich nations outside of Europe, Europe is the smallest continent on Earth, it cannot sustain itself with just it's own natural resources. Trade is one thing. But centuries of free labour is a big headstart (which happened to all races, more individuals of some races than others) and then an industrial revolution that needed to be fuelled by the raw materials of the international colonies, that's bound to boost your wallet even more. \nAnd on up to now you have the West sucking these resources from poorer countries at extortionate rates, (extortionate to those that believe all human beings should have equal rights) where hundreds of millions of families are living on less than $2 a day. You really want to deny a handful of those people the right to come here and enjoy a quality of life that their people helped us to build? How audacious of you\"",

The same way that yelling at your kid doesn't mean you hate them. The same way that getting into an argument with your best friend doesn't mean you hate them. Don't feel as though this is anti-white just because it criticises white people.\nIn a World where so many right wingers are convinced that Women and minorities are too sensitive, it's very ironic that you seem so sensitive to criticism.\n\n\n2) It's only okay to have racial preferences when you're a minority\n\nNO: It is okay only if your preference doesn't stem from subconscious <b> racism\n</b>I think that what this tries to do is to examine how for White people, however, racial preferences for Whites are rampant; and to study why they are so rampant, and whether or not the root is subconscious<b>  racism</b>. \n\n 3) If this where a study o<b> f Blac</b>k people, they would've only chosen oth<b> er Bla</b>ck people\n\nNO: In fact, if you were to l<b> ine Bl</b>ack people up and not white people, they'd happily choose to date white people. I, in fact, have never m<b> et a B</b>lack person who said they didn't have any racial preferences, and ending up being in a long term relationship with an<b> other </b>Black person. Why? B<b> ecause</b> Black people live in a World where Whites dominate economically, hold most of the political power, have beauty standards which are seen as universally superior . Most famous cities are win white majority countries, and history has been washed of any<b>  of its c</b>oloured presence (Jesus, the Egyptians), etc...; and White people make up most Nobel Prizes. Finally, the only instances <b> in whi</b>ch Black people disco<b> ver ot</b>her Black people is through the shallow worlds of sports and music, or through the insecurity complex inducing exclusive re<b> portin</b>g of Blac<b> k crim</b>e and Black poverty; not<b>  any s</b>ign of Black excellence. Naturally, blaming all of this on 18th century White people is oversimplifying. But the reality is that this current<b>  world</b> drowns Black people in the idea that they're inferior.  This translate<b> s into</b> so many Black women wea<b> ring w</b>eaves, or Black africans bleachin<b> g their </b>skin, or African American males' obsession with White women, for instance. Which is why this video would be completely different if<b>  it ex</b>amined only Black people's biases. Subconscious insecurity and complexes are incredib<b> ly pre</b>valent among Black people.",

You can't help who you feel attracted to.\nNow, let's be honest: the white guy was the most prefered one because he stood out as one of the most attractive ones. The asian guy really wasn't very good looking. There are plenty of hot asian guys (example: that guy Evan from Buzzfeed ) but this was just not one of them. Now we're racists for being honest? lmao Seriously\nAbout the girls, I thought they were both gorgeous but this comes from the perspective of a straight girl so..\nAnyway this shit is stupid as fuck",

It's the rulers that don't have much outbreeding going on for them the royal family like many royal families of Europe are a species to themselves and many Europeans looked down on their incestuous marriages (mainly found in mainland Europe) the traits many British have are due to them traits being attractive decades and centuries ago like <b> thin </b>lips,<b>  scrawny</b<b> > skinn</b>y with no curves, paper white skin, blue eyes and blon<b> de <b> r</b</b>>ed hair so many married though's with them traits.

Symmetrical faces are usually pretty but as far as meaning beautiful I'd doubt it, the most scientifically 'beautiful' <b> woman </b>in Britain is pretty but she is no great beauty.

Both are VERY homogeneous societies, one simply is able to keep the lights on while the other nation's people starve. \n\nBrazil has one of the highest rates of depression and tremendous violence, both are factors associated with diversity according to modern research. I think you are looking at economic indices as your sole metric and that's fine if your fundamental telos is that of an anarcho-capitalist but as far as metrics that are not concerned with quantitative nominal indices it's hardly a convincing argument.\n\nAlso why bring up Brazil, it's in an economic depression and has TREMENDOUS racial segregation?\n\nIf you want to look at diversity the<b>  ethnic</b> fractionalization index demonstrates the most diverse places, usually in Africa, also have severe economic depression and are fundamentally aid based economies.\n\n There is more to human existence than being a fungible cog in the engine of capitalism needless to say indices are subject to being throttled by centralized financial instruments for the purposes of accelerating growth but this is simply artificial way to look at social harmony.",

If you think it's legitimate to see nature as a source of moral authority then you must be fine with rape.\n\nPlus almost all racists would have a racial preference. It's a stupid ad hoc fallacy that bigoted people use. Kind of like the most rapists are men so most men are rapists crap. The same fallacy used to construct the idea that cannabis is a gateway to heroin.\n\nMany people have a preference to a certain body type and certain races are more prone to certain body types. Though feminists have the prescriptive ideology that says that all groups should be equal across all other groups or oppression is at play. They view the fact that men go for lighter complexions and women for darker (cis hetero) complexions a result of social conditioning as men and women are of course identical. All differences are inequalities caused by the big bad patricary. It's absolutely absurd and yet they wonder why people reject feminism.",

The double standard is so blatant.\n\nThe blatant disregard of science from the left is so clear to see. The idea that people choose who they are attracted to and who they don't and biology plays no part is complete bullshit. You can't make yourself attracted to someone, everyone fucking knows shit.\n\nTrying to guilt trip white people into dating non white people is emotional manipulation. \n\nUsing the same argument of 'because A is not attracted to B A must hate must change A's mind'\n\nAre men who are attracted to wom<b> en homophob</b>ic?",

You're literally not making any sense and refusing to even consider other points of view.\n\nIt's just like I have no idea how it is for you to move through the world as a white man because I haven't lived it. I don't know what it is to be male OR white. \n\nIt's just as how those born into rich and privileged families often don't understand the struggle or refuse to acknowledge the struggle of the working class because they just don't get it. Being rich is all they know. Just as you don't understand how it is to be a female in a male-run world.\n\nAs a person of colour, I see, hear and experience<b>  racism</b> in the UK all the time and people like you (willingl<b> y blin</b>d to the issues) are a huge part of the problem. What mak<b> es raci</b>sm in the UK insidious is that it is ingrained in our culture, deeply embedded in our societal and institutional structures that people don't even realise it is there anymore. That is how it differs from places like the USA where they are ope<b> nly rac</b>ist to your face. \n\nIt is not extremely rare otherwise it wouldn't be an issue and I wouldn't be spending my time trying to educate you over the damn internet. Programmes like this wouldn't exist. \n\nYou need to sit down and talk to more non-white people and try and see where we are coming from then you may begin to have some kind of understanding.",

School chastises you if you get the answer \"wrong\". Your parents chastise you for doing something the \"wrong way\", your friends emotionally hurt you if you do things \"wrong\". This builds\u00a0the idea that their is a right way to do things and a wrong way to do things, in\u00a0EVERYTHING,\u00a0and doing it wrong is emotionally charged with negative feelings. Therefore we avoid the \"wrong\" like the plague, even at the behest of learning something new. The irrefutable process of learning is paved with mistakes. We have to make them in order to gain the desired outcome that we are after. However school instils in us or conditions us to think that in EVERTHING their is a perfect answer surrounded by wrong ones. I could go deeper with things like all reality is an imperfect reflection of the idea, as it lives in perfect form, in the world of ideas, but that's too much for this! Suffice to say, not everything has a right and wrong answer.\n\nWhen I say that ethnical preference degrades the individual, the very notion of grading something as part of a group of things, even slightly, restricts its individuality, does it not? It can no longer be seen as separate from something, it is part of the group. All I am doing is asking about what you think about it, how it is framed in your mind. If you feel that you do not wish to divulge or its personal or whatever, that's cool. I was just after understanding your view point.\nI think sometimes people are taken aback by me, because it seems that the norm is that people don't give two s**ts about the ideas of others, just their own, whereas I like to explore what other people think about things and see if it makes sense to me. It helps me clarify my own thinking. However, if I have evidence that something which has been expressed is incorrect factually, I present it. But I am under no illusions that I am right, I am always open to the possibility that I have it completely incorrect, or that another way of thinking is superior to my own, and the only way to find that out is through debate. It's helpful in my goal to be the most knowledgeable version of myself that I can be. This then helps me to able to discern fact from fiction, which then in turn helps me to make the best possible choices. It also helps me with debating and exercising my brain.

For once, a little bit of debate with a slice of differing opinions without name calling and mud slinging. :)\nI think we all do have biases, even ones we are not aware of. I think this is what really contributes to us preferring a skin colour over another, or just completely dismissing a skin tone as potential dating material, rather than the innocuous \"I like what I like answer\". I think that answer tends to shy away from the idea that we have any choice and therefore no responsibility about who we are attracted to. However I assert that we have more control over such a thing than we admit, and that a lot of the time its other peoples influence over us that dictate our attraction, or who we are willing to admit to ourselves who we are attracted to. Take for example the man (or <b> woman)</b> who is of the mind that they are hetrosexual. Their minds will filter out the members of the same<b>  sex</b> that they are attracted to, to maintain the idea that they are hetrosexual. This will continue until they have gained an awareness of self and realise that those same feelings of attraction that they feel for the opposit<b> e se</b>x, they also feel for the sa<b> me s</b>ex. I use myself as example, it has taken me twenty one years to realise I find men attractive. However I will not sleep with a man, due to my own fears of w<b> hat </b>sex would be like. I also find women incredibly attractive also and because\u00a0of this\u00a0you could accuse m<b> e of se</b>xism which I think would be true, but I wont hide behind double talk and denial, I will hold my hand up to it. In that same way, I think that people are naturally attracted to people, rather<b>  than ethn</b>icity (which makes more sense to me than being attracted to a sp<b> ecific eth</b>nicity, since we have no gene for that) but we apply our own filter to decide that we don't want to find that person attractive, so we ignore the feelings. But even then, at some point, this will change. This is because our list of attraction changes over time and our awareness deepens. When you look back at the people you dated when younger and you think to yourself, whatever did I see in that person<b> . As</b> we age, our attraction widens. Why?",

Back then You're either part of an empire or part of someone else.\nWesterners have also spread the ideas of Liberty, law and order, free markets, Innovation. Then ended slavery globally as much as they could. Gave the world an enlightenment.\nStop judging western societies only by their lowest moments, it's easy to do I know, much harder to be balanced",
