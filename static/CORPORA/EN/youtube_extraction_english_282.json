If she knows much & learn alot from america, she can as well go help, clean her country, make it great again & still return to the US. After all, no place on earth is like home. Instead of getting so angry, trying hard to control, manipulate & detect to a country that took her in when she was in trouble & in need. I hope Nancy will be bold enough to rise up, shut this down immediate, stop playing & dancing around the squad! This is very sad, shameful & a failure on your part!",

Mrs. Omar - let us remind you that she is a US citizen, and in the free elections she was elected to the Chamber - she asks in public very simple and very honest questions . She noticed, because every American sees it, that in the USA one can examine - with surgical precision - lobbying in Congress for pharmaceutical, oil and armaments concerns. Rep. Mrs. Omar also noticed, because every American sees it, for unknown reasons it is forbidden to study lobbying in Congress for a foreign state - Israel. Rep. Mrs. Omar asks why? If pro-Israel organizations in the US lobby in favor of Israel in Congress, and if it is lawful, why can not speak publicly about it and study the scale of this phenomenon? And why the attempt to expect a fair and honest answer to the questions posed immediately is stigmatized by the accusation of anti-Semitism? I would like to remind you that the German Nuremberg Act of 1935 was called - rightly - anti-Semitism. Almost all the actions of the Third Reich on <b> nationality </b>issues were anti-Semitic and anti-Slavic. Whether pro-Israeli environments in the US do not see the difference between what the Rep is asking for. Mrs. Omar and anti-Semitism phenomenon sensu stricto?",

The only thing they agree on is the overwhelming hate they have for our president and how much of our taxpayers time and money they can waste to make his life miserable while he works to make our lives better.  Anyway, the Democrats are broke off into so many different sections that none of them know what the others are thinking in means of policy, reform or security and none of them care about the safety of Americans by securing our border. They should all be charged with domestic terrorism by neglecting the border emergency! Put them all in tents at the worst sections of the border and make them stay there a week! Let's see what their vote will be then!",

However, the 2 biggest Jewish 'tropes' people say Omar pushed were about the politicians she targeted being controlled by lobbying interests, and them having 'undue loyalties' perhaps to foreign countries or lobbies. First, regardless of party people are sick of special interests running the show as well as money in politics--irrespective of whether the money is from Jewish donors, Evangelical donors, Big oil, etc. Second, without even mentioning the Russian controversy--Hillary and Trump in 2016 endlessly criticized each other for accepting vast sums of $$ from Saudi Arabia via Trump Organization and Trump business vs. Clinton Foundation and how they're beholden to Saudi Arabian interests. What the hell is the difference?",

Is that why we have 89 dual Isreali nationals in the Congress and Senate ? Do we have any dual Muslims in the US Senate and Congress ?,  I'll bet not. Only the Isrealis can have dual citizenship and serve in the US government.  These traitors are loyal to Isreal, not the U.S.. Why do we as americans allow Isrealis to rule us. WTF are we idiots? Do a little research and you will see who controls the federal reserve,  Hollywood,  the media , the banks, etc. An educator here in Texas was fired for not singing an oath to Isreal in here employment contract.

She cannot handle the responsibilities as a leader and needs to be replaced Immediately by someone else in her party that can handle the job! The people have had enough of Pelosi letting these radical democrats get away with their behaviors! First, the swearing, then the bigotry, and then stripping the people jobs from Amazon! Not to mention that it seems irresponsible of Pelosi to put Omar in charge of Foreign Affairs and needs to immediately find someone else to take over that responsibility!!! I believe the people need to petition to have Pelosi and the radicals removed from congress!",

Seems to me that they're the same, so if Illhan is antisemitic then why isn't it<b>  racist</b> for Trump to be against illegal immigration from Mexico? Seems to me like Mexico and Israel are countries, not races, so how is i<b> t racis</b>t or antisemitic to be against either one's government? Oh wait it isn't. Plus, I thought Conservatives were against identity politics? Isn't this identity politics? Let me answer that for you, yes, yes it is - which would make anyone saying they were against IDPol but calling Illhan antisemitic a hypocrite.",

It's just another part of  orchestrated chaos which is the real story behind modern history. The forced importation and elevation of Islam has a very specific goal for elites and it is entirely prophetic. The Jewish support of the Rothchilds presumption over almost all economic processes when and where it has occurred may make of them the biggest fools ever to have lived",

But then Again you can't have a living animal with out there being a egg of some type . Now in the bible it sided the lord make man and <b> woman </b>and make animals for Adam and Eve . So this sounds like the Lord make then Animals first then the eggs came later ... Now doesn't that sound like the work of God to you ????

Mexican Americans(40 million ) will flip Texas and Arizona blue, just like they flipped California , Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado. When Trump disrespected Mexicans, he never gave us an apology . What this congress women did, will not make congress more republican because Mexicans don't care about what's going on between the USA and Israel. Want more votes ? Fix American problems like the millions of anchor babies who want their parents to have a peaceful life in the USA and give us a great, fair education to make this country richer.",

Try reading books and doing unbiased research dude.\n\nYou literally have no idea what you are talking about.\n\nBtw Denmark taxes their poor and middle class at the same percentage as their rich. While people who are degenerate evil lazy welfare bums don't have to pay income tax they still have to pay taxes on purchases.\n\nHow would you like 50% of your income taken in taxes even if you make minimum wage. On top of that a 25% tax on most purchases, a 180% tax on cars.\n\nHey need another vehicle. Go to Craigslist and find a used one for $1000 and you have to pay $1800 to the government in Denmark. 2800 for a $1000 used car if you can find one that cheap. What do you think that does to the poor?\n\nImagine paying over $50,000 for a $20,000 car because of the 180% tax. \n\nIn general things cost more in Denmark as well. A beer will cost 70% more then in the US. Coffee a third more, a dozen eggs 40% more. The companies that produce, import, transport, and store products all have to pay high taxes so they pass that on to the consumers. Oh and you will have to pay a 25% tax on most purchases on top of the higher prices.\n\nHousing is more expensive as well.\n\nImagine trying to live as a clerk or security guard or something when you have to pay the government more money in taxes (almost double) to buy a car then you give the owner.......and then half your pay gets taken in taxes.",

As they built a police state, with class system based on party, and in the case of Venezuela the state only controls some strategic industry (i.e. Energy/Defense). Private industry also existed in the Soviet Union since 1965, opposed to the Cold War narrative.\n\nI'm not a Socialist, although people don't even know the basics of it's philosophy. They just repeat what they were told, without researching the subject. At the same time Capitalism does seize personal property, through eminent domain sutures. With private business using the government as a proxy. A government owned by private business itself is not ideal and is a flaw of unregulated Capitalism.",

The poor israel\u00ed guy that was arrested and got deported was said to have been high fiving with the tower burning in the back ground. Declassified fbi photos and files.  He said they came to \"document the event\". And 3 hours after on live tv...the ex Israeli pm said it was Bin Laden. He named him right away. So smart. Maybe thats why the state department said \"there is no way they(mossad) couldn't know\" that we were gonna be attacked on 9/11. We need more Mossad to protect us",

What this congress women did, will not make congress more republican because Mexicans don't care about what's going on between the USA and Israel. Want more votes ?
