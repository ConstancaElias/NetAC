They do exist. What about the fact Labour's taxation and spending plans bring the UK in line which much of a developed world ? No - instead the media lie about the plan being radical. 5 When were the workers the best off ? when did the workers have most rights ? The best pay relative to cost of living ? When was social mobilitiy at its strongest ? The answer to all of these is the 1970 s.Yes - the hated 1970 s.Hated by the rich and powerful who never remind us of these things, but harp on about what they want us to see as negative. 5 So yesm, the MSM without question has an agenda to keep the richer getting richer and making the rest of us pay for it.The AS thing is just a weapon to them.

So it is not just Labour, we are not allowed to discuss reasons why without fear of label, that is another problem. It has dovetailed well with all previous socialist regimes of countries it has taken over, those thinking they are voting socialist, seem to have fallen for it every time, when it comes to socialism vs religion. So why do countries not stay socialist or even liberal for long with a large religious voting base ? Any ideas gratefully received. Or is it just simply ignorance on my part ? ",

They have a history of doing so: they came from the same struggle to see all people have a vote, to have union recognition, and to put into place policies for workers. They have been transported, hung, shot, jailed for their efforts. After WW2 the public voted out Churchill and replaced him with Atlee.The Labour government brought in the NHS, social housing to replace slums, social security, and much more. The result was a huge improvement to the lives of ordinary people.Inequality went down, early deaths went down, people could buy their own homes, they had more liesure time.etc. The ecomomic model was Kensyian - meaning money could not simply flow out of the country, so governments had control of things like tax. Since the 1980 's the establishment have rolled back the rights of working people. They took on a Friedman economic model, allowing money to flow out unchecked. Companies thus invested\" in low wage economies, which exported hundreds of thousands of jobs, and allowed them to set up tax havens they now exploit. They destroyed the unions, sold off everything publicly owned. So now you and I own next to <b> nothing.</b>We 're back to a 1930's style system of inequality.Slum housing has returned, precarious work is very<b>  common</b>.Health is an issue and the establishment have underfunded the NHS - and passed laws to privatise it in all but name.",

According to Sir Richard Dearlove, former Chief of the Secret Service, Jeremy Corbyn is a security risk who should not be entrusted with the keys of Number 10. According to Paul Johnson, Head of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, Labour's economic plans in their manifesto are \"not credible\". Yet 30 % of my fellow citizens still support Corbyn 's Labour Party. The same 30% who believe that Father Christmas will deliver a forest of magic money trees. The same 30% who don't care about our state secrets being divulged to our potential enemies.But frankly I do not believe that they share the same moral compass as the leadership of the Labour Party.Many will desert Labour now.",

The MSM don 't mention, for example, the Jewish people who do support Corbyn. Nor do they so how Corbyn is a \"security risk\", as if that's even possible from a PM.I recall Wilson being accused of being a soviet spy - nonesense promoted by the MSM, revealed as nonsense by the book Spycatcher.Nor do they report the many economists that say Corbyn is right.Nor do they report the fact the plans bring the UK in line with most developed countries.

Corbyn didn\u2019 t care enough to deal with antisemitism, which is running through the Labour Party, like a cancer through a sick animal, when he came to office in 2017, he didn\u2019 t care enough to sort out the cancer as it spread, with over 600 cases, most pending, no, Corbyn waits until just two weeks before a general election and dare to preach anything to those unfortunate to watch him. Ask the Jewish Communities, the chief rabbi, the Jewish Organisation how they feel about Corbyn\u2019 s antisemitic Party, that\u2019 s who we will take our guidance from, not from Jeromy Corbyn. ",

The MPAC will only bother with Khorbeen until they can field their own candidates in areas where immigration and fast breeding have made them the majority population group plenty of areas where they are on the verge. Then they will move to a Caliphate and the suppression of Christians and Jews will become the norm, as it is in Muslim countries the world over.",

After the GE they will suffer the same fate as the Libdems at the last GE when they only managed to get 12 mp 's elected. They will become a small extreme left wing fringe group. This is not a good outcome for the UK. For democracy to work political parties must be credible and offer a credible alternative, neither Libdems nor Labour fit that bill now. Just as, for the past three year parliament ran roughshod over the Conservative government who were powerless to do anything about it, we may well now get five years of Conservative government with no credible opposition to keep them in check. As for Boris, just like the rest I wouldn 't trust him as far as I could throw him.",

You probably know all about Labour\u2019s problems because the right wing media make sure it\u2019s at the forefront of your mind, while ignoring the same but worse problems in the tory party. Before the EU elections in June, 40 new tory members including 2 actual candidates were found to have made Isla mophobic comments on social media.In March, 15 tory councillors were suspended for making rac cist comments but later had the suspensions lifted.And then of course there was Johnson himself comparing devout Mus lim women to bank robbers and letterboxes.Can you imagine if Corbyn had said anything like that about devout Je ws ?? Which of course he would not. Cabinet minister Baroness Warsi has compared being a member of the tory party to being in an abusive relationship. And it\u2019 s not just Isla mophobia, tory party supporters were found by the normally pro tory Campaign Against AntiSemitism to be more anti Semitic than Labour supporters.",

What happened to the good <b> old </b>days when an editor Piers Morgan could be sacked for publishing photoshopped images? This is supposedly a screenshot of messages received, but they are in sender bubbles, not received bubbles. Also, visible cursor in the image shows it's on a computer, not phone. Sky News are tweeting this out also. Probably from Dominic Cummings lair of fakery. That doesn 't change the fact that the interview was a car crash. But then all interviews with Andrew Neil end up that way!",
