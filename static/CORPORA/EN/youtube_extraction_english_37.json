But if we want a future for our planet with us humans still ON it, we have to stare down our so-called enemies and not start killing folks unnecessarily.\nI'm backing Bernie right now. He's been consistent for decades. \"Unyielding\"... But he listened when he was asked about the need for <b> African </b>American participation and full citizenship (BLM).

Step back and ask yourself how and why that is possible. Then unsub this shite channel so your mind can start to heal.",

We do all have our own personalities and for lack of better terms \"quirks\" hahaha. Genetalia is not the sole determining factor of a leader, but it is important for many reasons that may not necessarily be fair. A leader is a distinct postion and it is not a role even most men can handle when it comes to leading large groups. But the thing is a leader does have to possess the ability to assert dominance in the proper situations or else a stronger group will just basically roll that said group over and conquer them. <b> Sexism </b>is just basically a neccessary evil, but a feminine man or a masculine<b>  woman</b> is not a subhuman and still deserves respect.

The \"at the right moment\" part is important. A leader also needs emotional intelligence and empathy. The ability to put the interests of the group in front of their own interests at times. Someone who isn't just trying to excel for the sole sake of improving their own career and salary, which some men are rather focused on. If you understand you're responsible for other people, you know you have to fight for their interests at times. And trust me I've seen women in leadership positions that can seriously kick some ass and fight for their team when it comes down to it. Maybe it's just a matter of different personal experiences between us two and that's why we have different opinions on that. In any case, best of luck to you too.",

Number 3: it is irresponsible for a<b>  woman</b> to allow men to hav<b> e se</b>x with a man outside of marrige, also it is irresponsible to enter into a marriage and then leave.  \nLook a lot of these modern day women are a huge problem and rather than accenting responsibility they would rather slander men. I see this happen to almost every man i know, also i know many single dads (my self included). Very few of us run out and find a new \"mom\" for our kids unlike a lot of these women that feel it is some other mans responsibility to be the dad. Of course all men are not good, and all women are not bad and blah blah, but all the real life statistics and facts point to the fact that women make horrible leaders,  and anything led by<b>  a wom</b>an is prone to destruction.",

I think in your mind that my opinions are based out of bitterness,  but the fact is most real men will not allow a <b> woman </b>to be their leader. But who cares being a leader is over rated, and just because someone is a leader, does not mean they are more important than a non-leader.

Most Women feel complete by being attractive and  or bearing children.  Men feel complete by screwing or screwing over.  This has kept the world going forever.   We have blindsided natural selection  by using outside resources and technologies.  We now live in a world where the most liked or connected gets the promotion instead of the most qualified.  This practice over centuries has unraveled everything we created to bring us where we are worldwide.   \nI think women have a conflicted time, now.  They  want to be equal, not equivalent.   And they don't react well to these inner conflicts. Just look how often Ana gets so overheated compared to Cenk. Though I thoroughly respect Ana, like many women their inner heat gets the best of them . They have a hare der time channeling it effectively. They don't value their powers. This affects their attitudes toward themselves and causes them to turn away from their primal nature.  They want respect instead of family.  All the while, willing to find <b> sexual </b>partners who are strong( willing to screw over).  And passing n men who would help them fulfill their primal needs. Yes  women have<b>  sexual</b> needs too.  But the need to be attractive is mitigated by  the looks of the men they sleep with, not the ethical merits.   Any wonder all the men accused in the 'me too' movement were unattractive.  If TomBrady was running Weinstein,  the story may have played out a bit differently.  I have two pretty sisters & they knew since day one, to be extra careful not to put themselves in those situations, no matter their desire to get the job, position, vanity movie project. \n   Men are tired of women pretending thei<b> r se</b>x is a commodity to be traded. That ship sailed in the seventies.  They have internet porn and. We live in a world of instant gratification.   Most Men don't want  to jump through hoops now that  good women are not a prize to win or earn.  Women have destroyed their enigma.   Everybody wants to be king.  Does Warren really think she needs to be president over Bernie, when she could just support him & make sure he gets elected!  But only women can have children so that's is the most important function for humanity, and they don't value it at all.",

None of that matters anymore. She has the increadible power to contradict herself twice in a single sentence and everyone just nods along or just talk for an hour without saying anything.\n\r\nMerkel swings wherever the wind blows at the moment and wont hesitate to throw out whatever principle she proclaimed she had yesterday if it is favorable - the only constant being lobbyism and corruption.\n\n\nGermany is slowly but surely going down the same road of corruption as the US and that has a very detrimental influence not only on German politics, but the entire EU and Merkel is doing her part in that.",

I of course told him this was complete an utter nonsense but he was convinced (as were those on the website comments) this was going to happen. Then when the military did training in Texas some years back, (something they always did), he and others believed that that training was part of the beginning of one, taking over Texas (which made no sense cause Texas is part of America), two, them taking the guns and putting them in F.E.M.A. camp.

LOL \n\nYou say I assume but I only did it once but you want to feel I did multiple times because it makes you feel you are right, Or maybe you don't realize that when you place certain words together they imply and mean things and that maybe if you don't mean such things you should learn to articulate better what it is you mean but instead of doing that. You just say I am assuming LOL. \n\n\n\nAnd again you ignored the part about me pointing out the nutty conspiracy because it doesn't fit even though you ask for \"facts\" about BS made up stories. \n\n\n\nLOL you can take it as a compliment if you want, you have created your own interpretation of everything else I have said why not this too. LOL. The deep end. LOL. Now who is assuming, no wait you're not assuming, you are just making stuff up. Does that made up deep end make you feel better? Does it allow you to ignore the conspiracy stuff. LOL.  For a guy who claims he wants a rational discussion you sure do a great deal of avoiding, making up standards, just making up \"deep ends\" with no explanation or reasoning. Maybe just maybe it's not the \"<b> lunatic </b>lefty\" fault that you can't get this \"rational discussion\" you say you seek. Maybe just maybe they aren't the problem. Maybe just maybe it's you.",

But if it happens in the country, only the attacker should be killed. But if you are not betrothed, then your attacker can pay the dowry and marry you. \n\nIf that isn't enough to make an<b> y woma</b>n say, WTF I'm not going along with this, what can!!!",

If you dont believe me, go to her own site and read it yourself.

If you are as well-informed as your reply seems to claim, you'll know that's telling half the story on all those items, which is just as bad as lying. Secondly, none of those things even applies to your original comment about her being Hillary 2.0 and a corporate shill. So you essentially couldn't find a way to support your original argument and just up and changed it to put her down for something else, as if that did support your premise. Either way, you seem incredibly disingenuous and pretty similar to the whole point of the video, being overly harsh on women, even when they work harder, have the most in-depth policies personally written (normally considered a campaign death sentence - instead it has been her boon), and supports better versions of the same progressive policies than the very man you tout and support whole-heartedly. Seems like you are actually a great example of how severely <b> sexism </b>is ingrained in our society.",

By being incapable of understanding outside of their own scope what systematic problems effect these other groups, they are far too rigid to believe open minded women are too naive to understand the conservatives' need for material economic gain as a bottom line is the only thing worth considering for policy, and if other categories of people being (Native Americans, immigrants, LBGTQ, etc) a victim to their process, it is an obstacle and interferes with their demographics ownership of the American system. They are adamant seperatists who believe nonconformists and unconventional thinkers belong beneath or outside the government's established priorities and any contributions simply benefit themselves and not back into their own hands.",

More importantly, of course the military uses resources from the Earth, where do the metals come from for guns, kevlar, and bullets? Where does the hemp from the parachutes come from? Where do you think American owned foreign bases get rerouted clean water irrigation from? Where does the oil for all the aircraft, watercraft and tanks come from? Whether domestic or international sources for those materials, that's where the majority of our taxes go towards.\n\nThe exorbitant military budget for taking over countries to bogart their resources is transparent even among Conservative leaders such as Ron Paul who openly admits these things, it doesn't take a liberal to know this is true\n\nWelfare (which is what I believe you're accusing as a hit to the economy) is hardly even a contender for for how much federal spending is used by comparison. The gains versus what the military spends is mostly on deaths of American citizens who didn't have to die just to supplant a foothold on a country that doesn't want a 3rd party overseer, and then opportunisticay install factories and refineries from private multinational corporations to have tax-free havens for opperation",

In fact, I know more women who have prejudices against other women. Separately, there are may women in politics who I find morally despicable.\n\nAnd by that same token, do you vote for a man because he is a man? Though I suppose the question here is changed, in that you always have many men to choose from. Isn't it odd that women don't have that same variety, and that,  when women support a female candidate, people assume it's only because of that candidate's womanhood?",

We seen it in France with many women voting for Macron because of his love story with an older lady and how 'progressive' he was Lol. Lets be honest here and fair...\nI have never voted and never will as there is a name for people who do the same things but expect different results. Yeah it's been mostly men to choose from as it's been mostly men who have built society and all you enjoy and take for granted. Refer to Nobel prize winners for citations. Don't let 20 years of sjw womens supremacy nonsense fool ya that's all just 'everyone gets a prize' inclusive modern society for people to attain things they couldn't earn on their own merits",

I won't label women I admire feminist out of respect, I prefer to call the 2 women I mentioned capable. you see I won't belittle their accomplishments by implying it is because of their <b> sex </b>or ideology related to<b>  gender</b>. They are compassionate, courageous, and dedicated, qualities anyone should aspire to possess. As to the dictionary, lol, feminism suffers from an unfortunate phenomenon of language and culture. It's usage caught on because of the association with women, with the struggle of women. Thus it accidentally tells the truth. It is for and about women, to the exclusion and submission of men. The only place you find the word equal in the rhetoric is in the dictionary and in the equal pay myth. Leave that aside for the moment, consider the ideological propaganda war waged for 40+ years to demonize men. The problem for both sides is that we are currently a binary species, slowly abandoning the appreciation and art of working and living together. Whatever form we choose it to take it should grow from mutual respect and appreciation. Militant feminists reject this simple ethic. I recommend the language of humanism instead, inclusiveness and mutual responsibility. The problems facing women are human, thus important to men. men's problems affect women, thus aught to be important to them also. Our problems, rights and responsibilities belong to us all.",

            "commentText": "Hillary in her early political years, was amazing. She was progressive, she was breaking through that glass ceiling, she was young and progressive. She watched MLK speak and she was inspired by that experience. Then she failed her bar exam in DC and met bill who wasn't really that smart or accomplished other than having passed his bar and being \"charismatic\" and she got involved in the investigation of the Watergate scandal. That's where she learned how to operate in absolute secrecy and that's what makes her so threatening. Bill consistently broke her down and eventually she gave up. \n\nI can understand why people dont like Hillary, but I just like to point out that she could have been this amazing progressive first <b> woman </b>president long ago. She took some wrong turns and made lots of mistakes, but her potential was there. It really breaks my heart.",

I doubt if the stories are made up. I do think it is a small minority that wouldn't vote for a<b>  woman</b>.  There are all sorts of reasons why people voted for Trump.  I was watching Professor Richard Wolf.  He is probably not the first to say this, but he believes a lot of democratic voters felt betrayed by the Democratic party because they were not working for them.  A lot of them were Obama voters.  There may not be enough to turn the tide for the presidential election but many Trump voters no feel they did the wrong thing by voting for him.  Wolff said this is the same reason people voted fo<b> r Brexi</b>t.  It was a big eff you to the labor party.  As I said there are other reasons Trump was elected.  Voter suppression. It is debatable as to how much Russia interfered.  I believe some one screwed around with voter machines.  Even 15 ye<b> ar o</b>ld can hack them. No doubt people distrusted Hillary, either because of the emails or they just disliked her in general.",

                    "commentText": "Beverely may I say something, hopefully without offending you? But first I understand what you are saying and I can see why you are frustrated. It is obvious overall that both sides seek to exploit <b> African </b>Americans for their votes, and once the elections are over they get thrown under the bus, time and again. Many non<b> -African</b> Americans think they can stereotype them and speak for them, and this has to be irritating. I acknowledge that sad fact, and I wish it were not true. \n\nAs a biracial Hawaiian-white kid who looked very white, I had to deal wit<b> h racis</b>m a lot from my fellow Polynesians, growing up in Hawaii. At many points I was the only Caucasian looking kid in rough schools and had to deal with almost daily assaults, and the constant insults. So at an ear<b> ly a</b>ge I truly hated bigotry in all forms. Bigotry is perpetrated by miserable cowards who hate themselves and turn that self- hatred and low self esteem on innocent people. They are cowards and bullies. They secretly fear that the people they hate are better than them. They are social cancer. \n\nWhen I joined the military, it was my first opportunity to h<b> ave Afri</b>can American friends, and I discovered that overall, they also hated bigotry and bullying. And <b> that Afr</b>ican Americans tend to be fiercely loyal friends who would have my back no matter what. Perhaps because o<b> f the r</b>acism in our count<b> ry, my A</b>frican American friends were often the ones to stand up to oppression and not back down. My friends defended people who were picked on. \n\nYes, I know we have good people like this from all races and backgrounds, but these traits if loyalty and courage against oppressors, is much stronger in any oppressed people. \n\nSo, I believe m<b> any non-</b>African Americans are confused when people whom President Trump has maligned and mistreated, support him. One example are the \"Muslims for Trump,\" group, despite that Trump stated \"They hate us,\" in and interview, and he made up a big lie about them, saying thousands of Muslims were dancing in the streets during 911.  Trump also put a defective Muslim ban in place, blocking Muslims nations who never attacked us, yet allowing Saudi open access, when they funded terrorism and 9 of the 10 who hijacked our planes were from Saudi Arabia. \n\nIt's the s<b> ame with</b> African Americans. Trump lost a lawsuit in New York for discriminatin<b> g agains</b>t African Americans and he r<b> eferred </b>to African countries as \"Shit holes,\" while saying he wished we had more people from Norway. Several of his former employees are in record stating Trump oft<b> en insul</b>ted African Americans intelligence and trustworthyness. In one of Trump's rallys, he pointed<b>  to the </b>lone African American and s<b> aid \"H</b>e is my black.\"\n\nIt's the same with poor whites. Why, many liberals ask, do they support and vote for someone who is only helping his fellow wealthy friends, and making things worse for them. Trump mocked them and said he likes \"uneducated people\" but will be appointing \"smart educated folks.\" More simply, he told them to their faces he would only hire the Good W<b> hit<b> es, and n</b</b>>ot white trash like them...and they cheered him on. \n\nTherefore, with the positi<b> ve stere</b>otype of African Americans being civil rights champions and the defenders of any oppressed group...many wonder w<b> hy peopl</b>e such as African Americans, poor whites, Latinos and Muslims would support and vote for a man who despises them, mocks them,  <b> and in t</b>he case of African Americans, Trump lost a lawsuit for illegal business actions from racial discrimination. Trump's response in court? \"Everyone else was discriminating against the blacks so I did it too.\"\n\nBut of co<b> urse you</b> are right. African Americans are sick of being used as a media and political prop. I just don't think he had bad intentions, but you are right.",

You think racists will vote for Biden over Trump? Why? If given the option between a republican and a republican...people will choose the republican every time. Bernie is the only candidate that appeals to the 99% regardless of their party affiliation. He is the ONLY ONE who can beat Drumpf. Also....as an aside. How exactly is the democracy at risk with Trump? I am no Trump fan, he is gross...but I fail to see how his policies or presidency is anymore harmful than Reagan, the Bushes or even Clinton for that matter (NAFTA, bankrupcy bill, mass incarcerations) or even Obama (deporter in chief, drone kill list, 8 wars)....I mean if Trump is anyworse than those characters it is a matter of degrees not existential.",

Turns out the 20 mio dollar deal they signed, was with Jeffrey Katzenberg, a DNC insider who donated 3 mio dollars to Hillary. apparantly he got editorial power, and can decide who they cover and how they cover them. This is also why they're anti-Tulsi. TYT sold out and are now DNC propaganda. Don't take my word for it, just research it yourself, type in Jeffrey Katzenberg and TYT in google. Then spread the word, and vote for Bernie or Tulsi.",

Tell that to TYT, who after getting backlash for this decided to call her supporters cultists.

How are any problems with Tulsi Gabbard worth dividing the progressive movement we've worked so hard to build? It makes no sense.

            "commentText": "Obliviously, there are going to be men who wont vote for a women just like there are 100% many women who will vote for a female candidate regardless if there is a better male option. I would love to have a first female president but Warren seems compromised. Tulsi Gabbard would be amazing and is the only women running that could get my vote in the primary. Trying to claim that Bernie and Warren are basically the same is very disingenuous. Warren is weak and will bend to the establishment as she has many times in the past and did recently with her vote to increase military spending. You literally made a 10 min video a couple years back about how she was acting different and siding with the establishment. Also, Andrew Yang comes off as more trust-able and has built a lot of traction and to claim he polls better because of his <b> gender </b>is  stupid and irresponsible. Maybe it is because she is a weaker watered down version of someone else in the<b>  race</b>. Ye<b> s sexis</b>m exists but you have literally no evidence for your claims. To counter your point a women won the popular vote in the last election despite being the worst candidate of all time.",

Biden of course is the bigger obstacle. Trump is literally the candidate built for Biden. Despite all his gaffes it'll never match Trump, people still think of Biden in fun meme terms, and of course a good amount of \u2018super moderate centrist Republicans/independents will happily vote for him as a safe anti-Trump vote. I've seen a good amount of Republicans I know saying they'd vote for Tulsi or Biden over Trump but no one else cause socialism \u2018slaps forehead'.",

In .my book either pay Taxes serve or served in Millary or police force . Or pass judgement social  and Ecomic test.\n women never has living fear of Draft. And Woodrow Wilson got America involed in world War1 under Political pressure from of course mostly women. Who would be drafted or fight. They only vote in many states but not federal. But ironically the Electoral Colleges are gave women power.  Blaming men for all the wars only holds water before women could vote. Women are by default the majority vote .to vote male deaths or Persecutions .make women by default the majority of Vote. It's visius sycle. . I. Unrestricted Democracy  tge people least Affected by the vote are majority vote. \nIn unrestricted Democracy tge Minor comforts of the many out vote  more basic needs and Rights of the Few.  Reason for water crise. And how Mysandrist justify the actual consqence's of false accusations much then just Emotional.    But they don't matter because they are extremely minority of voters. And convicted felons <b> sex </b>offenders can't vote. And lot got resistered and convicted  because the Majority voters demanded who we believe.  Again the visus sycle.\n\nAnd in Democracy the media has power then the federal government. Why press should compelled for speech . Cosby Scandal his accussers and actual deposition  are Examples for that.\n   And if think when Muslims become the majority vote don't think the construction will Protect you from Seria law.\n see how many constipation violations  WHEN women are majority vote.\n Feminism isn't the future. Rome did the same things  no fault Divorces Alimonia say it was called.  Listening women's demands on not rationing Jewelry  .when military needed that metal to fight hanibler",

Black men got the right to vote 50 years before white wome<b> n did </b>and black women got the right to <b> vote l</b>ast. Black men aren't seen as property, while women are, of course not everyone sees women as objects but just go and open up any porn site and you'll see the objectification. It's still a tradition that when <b> a man </b>and a wo<b> man ma</b>rry, a woman takes the last name.

At no point during the decades trend of rock n roll from the 60s all the way up to the 90s did you ever hear of rock stars busses getting shot at, but that's something you can find on a regular basis for rappers. Watch a modern rap video, all they do is dance around with uzis and machine guns rapping about killing opps etc. that behavior is NOT because of systemic<b>  racism</b>. Why is it blacks in the 60s had much worse circumstances, yet seemed like respectable educated and responsible people? The democrats forced the father's from the homes o<b> f blac</b>k people aft<b> er Jim <b> Cr</b</b>>ow in order for mothers to get welfare thereby negating the presence of any male role model, and kept them dependent on government for the folllowing 60 years.

If as a <b> woman </b>you cannot appear strong to people they will subconciously or conciously shy away from wanting you in a leadership role.\n\nWarrens inability to appear strong is her problem because society right now makes it a problem as it has a preconcieved notion that women are weak as a general rule.  It isnt fair, but that is a hurdle she will have to jump over higher than her male counterparts.  Harris' ability to not appear genuine is her problem because society wants genuine and this comes less from her being a<b>  woman</b> and more from her being a politician and people dont trust politicians as much.  So she has less of a hurdle to overcome than warren.\n\nThe democratic poles showing off how favored warren is to harris just goes to show how much better warren has done connecting with people kn the primary. \n\nThe general wont have the same handicap for genuine players unfortunately.",

Can't we call ou<b> t sexis</b>m at the same time that female candidates are out there trying to break the stereotype?\n\n\"Electability\" is a mantra that deserves questioning. It's just like the swing-voter paradox. Let's say 100 people are voting on candidates X, Y, and Z. One person really likes Z but doesn't think they will win, so they vote for their second choice, candidate Y. But what if the other 99 people were split evenly... 33 for each candidate. All of a sudden, the swing voter's logic fails because whoever they voted for would have been the winner. So they elected Y, but they should have voted Z.\n\nIn the same way, voters can potentially convince themselves that Warren will lose, while in reality their full support could secure a win. But, by pulling their vote, they fulfill their own prophecy. Hillary lost by a very slim margin, and yet people continue chanting \"electability\" as soon <b> as sexi</b>sm is brought up.

Whether its in reference to being called Pocahontas or being challenged about her foriegn policy.  Why do you really think she avoids interviews with networks that would not \"play nice\" with her?\n\nShe does not handle mud slinging challenges well... not even as well as hillary.   Hillary has a million more problems than warren or course but we are trying to be objective here and one of her greatest weaknesses is being unable to take the nasty bullshit of the plebian mudspeak well.\n\nThere is <b> nothing </b>wrong with calling out the bullshit as you see it.  The problem is that a lot of people dont care if it is mean spirited or sexist.  In their minds a Leader, (or someone who they are giving control of their life) needs to appear like a larger than life human.  Warren does not pull this mantle off.  Which i would bet is a majority of why her biggest support comes from well educated people that arent looking for a larger than life leader and just looking for someone to legislate.",

A country only has one firs<b> t woma</b>n president, and I want ours to be one that people can look up to, one that's respected for her honesty, etc. Last election, it was so obvious that Hillary didn't fit the bill. This time, there's a few women that could. Tulsi Gabbard, on paper, would make an excellent fir<b> st wom</b>an president, but the party establishment and media are too corporate for that to happen. Elizabeth Warren, if she would extend her no corporate money promise into the general election, has a great chance of being the fi<b> rst wo</b>man president.",

It's more likely a bias against her because they're close to Massachusetts and see her policies in their media markets and don't like them.

Every man did it and women who complained were seen as whiners. To this day and for years to com<b> e doctor</b>s will take women's complaints way less serious than men's. Ignored illnesses kill thousands of women because they were not taken seriously. That is not going to change any time soon. It is the way it is. We WILL keep fighting but I'm not deluding myself in thinking it's going to improve overnight. We can fight in wars with you, work in construction like you, do all the things you do but still we are seen as weaker, less intelligent, hysterical and living incubators by the ruling class. The sad thing is that all the women in the world can't change this alone. It unfortunately takes a man to do that. That is also why America is not yet ready for a female president. Everything that isn't to the liking of the ruling class men will be blamed on the fact that the president is<b>  a wom</b>an and that will undo any progress we have made si far! Americans need to learn to think more strategic but unfortunately they tend to run to far ahead of themselves and that is why Europe has evolved but America is still stuck rock solid in the 1950s. Observe and adjust, don't go out guns blazing and try to force change on th<b> ese </b>old fashioned people because it will terrify them and make them even more extreme.4 years of Bernie Sanders will change everything in a positive way, 4 years of Warren will undo everything. It's the sad truth. Greetings from Europe.",

Don't worry I don't get a move when this game is played. My point is she and I communicate diffrently. She also has a much diffrent approach to problems, dealing with new issues. Adapting to diffrent situations. Not saying all people of one<b>  gender</b> are exactly the same there not. What I am saying is that the hard wiring is diffrent, and we cone with a little diffrent software. So to end the long of it. I look forward to the first female being president. It will still be our goverment, constitution ect... But how it is employed will be diffrent. I'm not saying mandatory attendance consernin<b> g chic</b>k flicks will be legislated. I don't see federal government building show your emotions booths everywhere. ( my family makes these comments thier still living in 50s. I will say that how our system works will be the same with<b>  a wom</b>an. It will just be less messy not as sweaty. It will show less outward aggression, and will dress with a bit more taste.

Okay, that is 1 poll and there is probably a trillion factors to take into account. You state that Warren and Bernie have similar positions so it doesn't make sense. When, for a really long time.. Warren' voters #2 choice was Kamala Harris, and Bernie's #2 were Joe Biden. So, sometimes voters don't make sense.\r\n\r\nI'll also cite you another poll to demonstrate this. Late August, there was a poll that had Warren beating Trump by +6 in Michigan whilst Sanders beat him +4 tieing with Kamala.\r\n\r\nNow, This makes 0 sense because we all know Sanders is the guy who opposes all the trade deals, yes Warren does as well but no where near as vocal or has a track record of it like Sanders. Also, this is the same state that Sanders beat Hillary in 2016 even though he was down like 15-20% in the polls. Also, why is he tied with Kamala when going against trump? She hasn't been that vocal against the trade deals at all or any major policy that would affect a state like Michigan. \n\n\n\n\nThere are just way too many factors to simply say majority of the reason is sexism",

While all the things you mentioned may have an effect, there is no way for example that people there are fully aware of Andrew Yang's policies. Kamla harris is drowning in corporate money and refuses to stand against very problem you have mentioned about Elizabeth not voicing very loud as Bernie. \nNow personally, I believe sometimes people don't want to believe that a problem exists so that they can breath somehow and continue their life because the truth heart and it hearts very bad. The bias you have is not intentional but is there. Dude this is 2019 and we are yet to have a women as a president and you still want to argue that sexisms is not a factor?? Are you serious?!! The probability of people voting for a criminal in US as a president is higher that a <b> Woman </b>dude. It is<b>  crazy</b> to think that we don't a face a huge problem regarding trusting <b> a woma</b>n. It <b> is cra</b>zy, painful and sad but it very much EXIST. What we SHOULDN'T do is Bury our head in to sand man. This is very true and we need to deal with it. We really need to educate people specially women. I always say that Mothers are the key here. They should teach this to their children at first then of course we have to work on the dogma men are facing in their lives.",

Also, this is 1 poll and it is emerson (same polling company that says Warren and Biden are at 21 and 23%, whilst Bernie is at 13%, which is 100% bs compared to most polls so I wouldn't trust their polling too much).\n\n\n\n\nAlso, the argument that \"Well, we don't have a female president yet so how can you s<b> ay sexi</b>sm doesn't exist\" is like someone saying \"Well, Obama<b>  is bl</b>ack and he got voted into offic<b> e so ra</b>cism doesn't exist anymore\"<b> .\n\n\n\n\nS</b>exism does exist, it is a massive problem and needs to be resolved. My issue with the video isn't the conclusion but the way he got there. If he argued \"Hey, theres still a massive pay gap, theres no paid maternal leave yet\" etc... I'd be on broad with it.\n\n\nHowever, saying \"Well, I talked to some cab drivers and I saw one poll so now it made me realise h<b> ow big </b>sexism is\" is just insane to me.\n\n\n\n\nIf you dive even a little bit deep into the data, you realise that voters legit make no sense at all with this kind of stuff. I wish it was something as clear as \"They think women make bad leaders so they wont vote for Warren\" or \"They value progressive ideas so they vote for Bernie\" but it never is. Some will say they want corruption gone, but they'll vote for Biden. Others will say they want moderate ideas, but still vote for Warren or Sanders.",

Women are underrepresented in positions of power, be it economical or political, 3 to 1.  <b> Gender </b>economic inequality is very real. There is a 20% pay gap, women make 27% of the top 10%, less than 17% of the top 1% and 11% of the top 0.1%. Women make up 63 percent of workers earning the federal minimum wage and represent only 5 percent of CEOs at Fortune 500 firms. They also hold only around 1/4 of the seats on congress (senate and the house) and thats a record from 20% before 2018 elections. In many other ways women are not receiving the same consideration as men. In healthcare, women are more likely to receive misdiagnosis or have their symptoms dismissed, have to wait more for painkillers and are less likely to receive them.<b>  Sexism</b> is very much widespread.",

And those inequalities need to be addressed, but women are by far the worse off when you take society as a whole into consideration. Wages, job opportunities, physical autonomy, political representation and imposed conformities of body image and beauty.\n\nLook at your own example. You state matter-of-factly '...the poor bastard that worked to buy them.' Why do you assume that the man did the work and the <b> woman </b>did not? It's because that's the likely situation, as men earn more for the same work and get better opportunities for advancement. You stated there are kids in this scenario and it's just presumed that the<b>  woman</b> is the one staying home, raising the kids.",

Looking at the comment section (and the section of a large % of videos and comments posted by women) made the severity of the situation clear. I posted a response to the effect that the purpose of mainstream feminism is equality, not advantage. The very first response I got said, basically, that you can't help women because \"with feminists, you give them an inch, they'll take a mile.\" My wife posted once from my account when we were having issues with hers. She said she didn't think it was working. Why? Because there weren't already dozens of hateful messages using the b word, c word, t word, etc. We later posted the same comment from her account and realized the difference was a female name and picture. Some people, mostly men, don't seem to be able to separate the source from the substance.",

When people get so sick of the side effects of machismo leadership, the primal instinct to seek out a maternal, nurturing leader to fix the problem becomes a force for change. Subconsciously. Whether we realize it or not. The good news is that the women leaders in this position tend to be so much better, in hindsight, than any other man. \n\nSo, think about how messed up Trump has made things. Then vote for a <b> woman!</b> It's the best way to fix the damage done by Trump to undermine US internal agencies and international relationships. \n\nIt will be especially helpful if the candidate has experience building pro-consumer government agencies from scratch. \n\nJust sayin'.",

Their are plenty of women in politics that would not get my vote for running a public restroom, but there are also many in there recently that show a real fire for fighting for the taxpayers, and calling out the corruption that is destroying our democracy",

            "commentText": "Cenk, this is aimed directly at you as one of the best known non--politician leaders of the progressive movement.  I have had a problem with you ever since I started watching TYT, although I watched you on MSNBC for a long time without ever seeing this problem.  I am sure it existed them, I simply didn't notice it.  \n\n\nWe are all human, and as such, are imperfect and in one way or another, all problems that can exist in humans exists in every one of us.  <b> Racism,</b><b>  sexism</b> and every other \"ism\" that exists can be found in every one of us to some extent.  Around the time  that I quit watching MSNBC (before you left that network) I was beginning to teach using this \"mantra\" as a guiding principle: \"If you cannot be honest with yourself you cannot be honest with anyone else.\"\n\n\nThat kind of self-honesty is largely lacking from both you and Ana, and as a result from the entire organization and its followers.  I find it very grating when you or Ana say, \"But we are progressives so we don't do that.\"  All to often that statement either follows or is followed by some act or statement of blindness where you do just that, but not quite so openly.  Unfortunately, because of the claim made that we do not do that, the act or statement is considerably MORE egregious than what the Repelicans do and say so openly.\n\n\nYes<b> , Sexis</b>m, along wi<b> th raci</b>sm <b> and age</b>ism (something well demonstrated among the Young Turks this past week by Emma and John) are much worse that any of us realize, but it is because we refuse to recognize and acknowledge those traits in ourselves.  Emma is very defini<b> tely ag</b>eist.  Don't bother denying it.  The comment she made is true, but she made it only <b> abou</b>t OLD right-wingers and not right-wingers in general, including many who are younger than her.  J<b> ohn is </b>ageist too.  He did not notice Emma's remark and how offensive it was, and allowed it to go without comment.  You lost some listeners over that if the comments are to be believed.  Y<b> et such</b> ageism is not the defining characteristic of either Emma or John, and it is unfortunate that this gaffe has diminished your organization agai<b> nst </b>this age group.\n\n\n\"Unless we can be honest with ourselves,\" means that we much ALWAYS look at ourselves, both individually and as a group (tribe) and say, \"What am I doing or saying that shows this is a problem in me,\" and, \"What is the group to which I belong doing or saying that proves it is a problem in us.\"  Until we do this and address the problem within rather than deny it, hide it, bury it deep within, we neither have the moral right to address it in anyone else, nor will we ever have any understanding as to just how serious the problem really is.\n\n\nMaybe you don't have a pro<b> blem wi</b>th<b>  sexism</b> o<b> r racis</b>m or ageism or any other ism because of good education<b>  at </b>an early age or having learned otherwise from honest observations later in life.  After all, you are a repentant repelican, as I am.  But just because you have overcome these sins does not mean they are totally eradicated from your life and does not mean the rest of your group had had that epiphany.  BECAUSE you have not been honest with yourself about any of those \"buts\" you have not been really honest about anything else or with anyone else.\n\n\nYou are on the right track with this new understanding.  Keep on keeping on.  That is what really makes us \"progressive\"\n\n\nMyron",

Everyone believes they are perfect and everyone else is the the problem, and because Putin insist he didn't do it you believe him too, even though the evidence of your own investigators appears to prove otherwise.  \n\n\nI don't need to prove Emma is <b> Ageist.</b>  Her own words proved it in a moment when she was unguarded in her speech.  She doesn't only stand for Warren; she much prefers Sanders who is older still.  I said it is not her defining characteristic.  Her rationality overrides the faults.  But like you, Trump, she is not admitting them, she lets them show and she offended a lot of people (some of whom NEEDED to be offended) as a result.\n\n\nI know you don't care.  Most people don't because it is easier to claim you are perfect than to admit your shortcomings and deal with them and their aftermath. You can be as dishonest with yourself as you wish and not care at all how inherently dishonest you are, but don't expect me to sit back and not call you on that dishonesty.  My comment was public, but is addressed to Cenk, who is mostly honest and is publishing this video dealing with a matter of his own lack of self-candor and the lack of honesty among the rest of the progressives and other democrats.",

Looking at it without th<b> e gende</b>r lens risks missing important aspects <b> of gend</b>er.\n\nSecond, it is necessary not to erase the existence of women who are homeless. Even though men are more likely to be homeless, homelessness is a lot m<b> ore gen</b>der equal than a lot of people present it. The primary causes of homelessness\u2013 poverty, lack of affordable housing, unemployment\u2013 affect everyone, regardles<b> s of ge</b>nder. A large percentage of the increase in homeless families is probably caused by the recession: unemployment and lack of affordable housing were the two most commonly cited causes of the increase in homeless families.\n\nThird, it is important to note that there may be reasons why women are more likely to be housed than men that still don't mean the women are in a particularly good situation. For instance, women are more likely to participate in sur<b> viva</b>l sex in exchange for housing. 'Su<b> rviv</b>al sex or homelessness,' however, is one of those dilemmas that really leaves no one in a particularly good situation.\"",

Mostly on policy, some on trustworthiness. It's hard to compare any other candidate to Bernie cuz heads and tails above in terms of character, trustworthiness, being able to count on what he says, honesty, integrity, not getting wishy washy about things like healthcare -Warren-, and most importantly he's got the best policy positions and I have to say, I don't believe she can stand up to 45. In the street brawl that's coming she will be run over. Not because she's a<b>  woman</b>, but because she, the person, can't play at that level. Also, she's got the Hillary scent all over her, who, yes I believe she would have been an ok president, but most of the issues we face would still be the issues we'd be facing even if she had been pres. I don't believe Warren will go to the wall for many of the issues, she'll accept half measures and I don't think we can change much even if she won. For me, its not about women, I think women rock everything they touch, but it is about each person and their suitability for the job.",

Bernie is feared. That is a good thing. I think Trump will make her look flustered and like she's going to cry, as she does during some of the debates already. I think she's sincere, although her meetings with Hillary give me pause for sure. Will I vote for her if she's the nominee? yes, but not with a lot of faith in our future.",

No pack wants to be lead by a weak leader. In the animal kingdom its always been a male challenging another male. In mother nature there's no discrimination and only the strong survive. Another reason is women haven't paid their dues. Women want the top powerful jobs without no representation on the dirty undesirable jobs at the bottom. How many women do you see working for waste management that pick up trash, road kill, clean out and rehab sanit<b> ary sep</b>tic tanks, clean out livestock pens, any jobs that deals with thick sludge build up of poops, blood, pee, foul odors, and work in the hot sun.

People are allowed to criticize.  And along those lines, one of the reasons why I am hesitant to support Tulsi is I think that her views toward India in general, and Modi in particular, is a really really bad dark stain on her Progressive credentials.",

If she does happen to will the primary, I will fully support her. Her tip-toeing around Modi just makes me nervous, especially considering what has happened recently with Kashmir.

It's been like that for centuries in this country and millennia around the world. For the longest time, men didn't listen to women about the subject of <b> sexism.</b> A lot of the time, a lot of guys still don't listen, or even consider the idea of listening to women about anything. I think the times are changing though, because some men have been becoming more woke in the subject of sexist discrimination towards women. It's these woke men that can talk to other men about these issues, and get them to actually listen. I think the more woke men talk to other men, those men that wouldn't listen before become woke themselves. The more woke men we have, the more they can enact real change. I know it's a bit late to see this real problem, but the fact that Cenk can be open on the issue, and can see how bad things are, gives me hope because I think he can make a big influence, and is the type of ally that we need. I also thank Cenk for this video, because it's helpful to the cause",

Original post: So we are supposed to believe that warren is lagging \"because <b> sexism\"</b>? Sounds a lot like the Hillary 2016 crowd making excuses for their candidate. If you can't accept or acknowledge the real reasons Warren is lagging then you are useless.  The real reason Cenk hesitated in making this is because he was afraid of losing access if it came across the wrong way, so he tried to spin it into a \"Warren as the victim\" narrative. Cenk is a blatant careerist capitalizing off of well-meaning podunk Americans & college kids who don't know how to recognize bullshit when they see it.  Anybody who donates to these people is either stupid or ignorant.",

They both\nhave been in Washington too long, they are both too <b> old,</b>\nand they both have failed in previous attempts at becoming\nPresident. Any one of these traits is bad enough. \nBoth Biden and Sanders have all three !!\n\nThere is definitely prejudice against Warren for being a strong\nwomen. That is why proven failures like Biden and Sanders are \nconsidered \"competitive\".  If Warren's performance were as bad\nas Biden's, she would be polling in the single digits.\n\nThere is no way that Biden has been performing better than\nWarren on the campaign trail. In reality, Warren has been\noutperforming Biden! When it comes to strong female leadership,\nProgressives are just as uptight as right wing Conservatives.\nProgressives like to talk \"inclusion\". However, they are just as\nresistant to a strong female President as the rabid right wing.\n\nImposters like Hilary Clinton have a chance of getting the\nnomination. Clinton was never strong or independent.\nBut, a truly strong and independent women like Warren will\nhave a harder time. She can still do it. But, it will not be easy !",

Tulsi DOES have plans that address those subjects and more... and her plans will become more defined over the next several months. With the election more than a year away there is still plenty of time to develop those plans. Furthermore, what candidate already has finished detailed plans for all of their platform this early in the <b> race?</b> That is rediculous and unnecessary! Many things could happen between now and the election that may change what is most important to focus on and again Tulsi DOES have plans for her entire platform and will continue to define them over the next several months. Most importantly.... Elizabeth Warren is BORING... She is NOT an interesting candidate and is NOT ELECTABLE. She is NOT inspiring and would be destroyed by Trump in a face to face debate or in a national election! Tulsi will CRUSH Trump in a face to face debate AND in a national election. Just go and read the comments in ANY of her posts. She is LOVED LOVED LOVED!!! I have NEVER SEEN the kind of LOVE and STRONG LOYAL SUPPORT for ANY OTHER candidate except MAYBE Bernie.",

But this comes across as a campaign endorsement of Elizabeth Warren along the lines of, 'She being prejudiced against and that's so wrong! Let's put <b> a woma</b>n in the WH to prove we as a country are over that stuff'.\nNewflash, it's not going to get people over it. And in fact, throw shade at me all you want, but this underlying prejudice is one of the reasons why, unfortunately, I don't think Elizabeth Warren should be the nominee at this time, because it WILL weaken her.\nWe are long past the point where we can afford to play games in pushing social justice reforms. We're in a fight for our lives right now whereby if we do not get the money out of politics and dismantle the establishment we're all done for. And as such we should want the strongest possible candidate in there. And yeah, that candidate happens to be <b> an o</b>ld white dude who's got no skeletons in his closet that can be used against him.\nI love what you do Cenk and I know your heart's in the right place, but this sort of video really does not help the Progressive cause right now.",

The election is a YEAR away and you think Elizabeth Warren is going to inspire the masses of disgruntled Americans who are UTTERLY SICK of Corporatist Candidates who PANDER to the public while they play a FAKE \"progressive\" candidate role? Warren would be destroyed by Trump in a face to face debate or national election. Tulsi Gabbard is THE ONLY<b>  WOMAN</b> running for president that can and will CRUSH Trump in a face to face debate and national election. Just watch and WEEP you poor SHILLS at TYT!

That being said political strategy would dictate that female candidates are disadvantaged by this societal<b>  sexism</b>. What matters first and foremost is getting Progressive policies implemented and having someone who we know for sure will do it I office. Thei<b> r gende</b>r is only a factor when trying to appeal to voters at a surface level, and is only in truth strategic concern. The fact is Warren has a strategic disadvantage when pitted against male candidates of similar positions and that needs to be accounted for when calculating her chances of winning the primary. That being said it also matters how awful her opponent is on policy and personality. Warren is way more likely to beat Trump than any of the other female candidates and that's something she has earned with her record and her presence as a Senator known for reprimanding Bank CEOs on National TV. She's strong and playing into that is the best thing she can do to mitiga<b> te gend</b>er stereotyping done by people with sexist tendencies. In fact, playing into strength and being bold is the best thing any candidate can do at this time in politics, provided they have policies that are broadly appealing to the vast majority as shown in polling, and most Progressives candidates do.",

I know we don't matter but let's see who is next because Harris is another none starter for us. But our demographic is ignored as usual! We just sit back and wait for the organized criminals and the prosperity preachers posing as politicians to tell us what we need?",

If Tulsi was more famous, I think she would also be doing worse. The whole idea is male candidates do terrible stuff all the time, and people forget quickly, but somehow a<b>  woman</b> does something similar and you never forget it! Really, I feel like what are we going to do to AOC or other Justice democrats (in the future) that will get in the way from them being able to pass legislation on issues we all say we want! (That is my core concern I guess, how will we progressives self-sabotage as we gain power)\n\nI mean, you got some \"progressive\" people jumping through hoops to forgive Trump, but Warren is the devil? She didn't endorse Bernie last time? Who cares!? She might be more of a War Hawk than Bernie, better answer, but why are you forgiving Trump? He was one note away from getting us in war with North Korea, he is getting us into a war with Iran! For No reason! That was not John Bolton, it was all him! Trump seems like he will get us in a war with Canada if we aren't careful!\n\nThen you got the other people where they are stanche Biden supporters but Bernie is their second choice... Why?? HOW? That makes no sense other than name recognition! I would assume they would be more likely to be Harris or Klobuchar supporters, I guess not! (That could be more name recognition because you also would think they'd at least be Buttigieg supporters)\n\nI just think, clearly it isn't everyone, but there is a significant percent. It's a close<b> t sexis</b>m, and you can smell it out and be suspicious of it (just like clos<b> et raci</b>sm). I guess I'd be a fool to think that it would be less among general low information voters, it's probably much worse... but I won't let that influence my political decisions because that is how we've held back so many minorities and minority issues in the democratic party (in addition to obviously women's issues), and yet we still were able to elect Obama. It just is frustrating because this kind of stuff is on us for not correcting or debating family members that have these beliefs.",

In that case, I really don't care who disregards you. I sure as hell do. Classic demanding of respect by their \"inferiors\", but will never give it and gloat about how much you don't respect them, even if they grovel at your feet. Oh no, you get to decide when you will respect them... which will never, but they had better be loyal, respect and kiss your ass...cuz male. Nope, that not what we need to be teaching our daughters. \n\n\n\n\"no is entitled to respect..or teach they are entitled to respect.\" \"ever think.maybe it's that don't deserve respect because they themselves do having any.\" \n\n\"disrergurding.\" Wtf does that word garbage salad even mean? Are you a six year <b> old </b>with brain damage? I'm not \"regarding\" or \"respecting\" that. You're a joke. Terms were not meant for women? Well, when you learn how to spell and properly voice your own demands and \"terms\", you get back to me, you hear? =.=",

On the Dem side, real progressive will prefer Sanders, because he is more progressive. More conservative Dems will prefer Bidden, because he is more conservative. On the Republican side she was trashed so much by the right wing media that you will never get a Republican to vote for her.

I'm pretty sure a cartoon of jesus wouldn't result in millions of Christians WORLWIDE rioting in the streets and committing murders. Like the Danish cartoons did. The worst thing is the people who stick their heads up their arse and try to pretend it's not a problem , it's a culture thing and you CAN'T critise a culture or your <b> racist </b>or \"islamophobic\" we were sold this crap in Birmingham in the 80s and now we are overrun. This year Birmingham school's were forced to removes same<b>  sex</b> characters from books cos Muslim parents were rioting outside schools. Suddenly th<b> e g<b> a</b</b>>y community that spent years standing up for the poor Muslims have realised Muslims HATE them and now the numbers are so high iys too late...in 10 years time the LGTQ community in European countries are in for a HUUUGE shock as Muslim numbers grow and they find out  the EXACT DIFFERENCES in Islam to other religion's",

No one literally no one could ever have a post birth abortion , that's called murder and no doctor ever has or ever will do that. \nIn the very very few cases where women under extremely difficult situations have to have a late term, ie after 24 weeks abortion then that is always a very difficult choice. \n\n\nThe law allows the doctor not to rush a child  to hospital via ambulance if it is born after 35 weeks with life threatening problems incompatible with life, eg born with its abdominal organs outside its abdomen, born with a minuscule brain, awful problems like that. Imagine giving birth to a baby in those dreadful circumstances, would you rather your  very much loved baby stay warm and safe cuddled and your partner  with or rush off in an ambulance for its last few moments of life in a futile attempt to keep it alive. Get off your high horse, do proper research and stop spouting right wing propaganda. Have some compassion for those poor unfortunate families involved in a heart breaking situation like that.",

Growing up Elizabeth Warren did not grow up with computers and internet, DNA tests, or even a push button phone. You got all your news from news papers and if you weren't poverty stricken (which Warren was) you might have been lucky enough to watch the local news at six (in <b> black </b>and white).Kids used books called encyclopedias to look up information at a library. In other words, info was very difficult to come by. In those days we passed on family information by word of mouth (a habit formed by thousands of years of practice) over coffee at the kitchen table, or shelling beans on the porch. If your parents or grandparents said it, then it was true. That was the only way TO do it. You learn something young and it becomes ingrained in you. It may never have occurred to her to doubt it. What kind of proof did the colleges even ask for? To assume that when someone is wrong about something, they are liars, is harsh and unrealistic. You wouldn't want to live that way. No one should have to.",

I never pretended to be a Native, and and I sure didn't put it on a professional certificate in a time and place when token diversity hires with as little diversity as possible was fashionable and lucrative. But you want to contend that she's ok because she \"didn't know,\" right? Well she hadn't a damned thing to say of any value on any Native issue from the day she claimed she was practicing law as a Native in the 70s til she avoided the hell out of Standing Rock (but found plenty of time to kiss Hillary's ass). I'm pretty sure we had over 20 years of internet by 2016, and she was still listed as \"Native\" professionally. Your next dodge will have to be something along the line of \"interested in other issues, like the CPB,\" right? But she spent the last campaign season backstabbing progressives and conspiring with 3rd Way princess Hillary. She is consulting with Hillary this season. The problem I have with Warren is that she'll take a career move over a moral one far more often than not, and it looks very like she is making the same kinds of deals Obama did. That might get her a super delegate nomination despite being a less popular candidate (remember 2016??). But what happens after? She'll be beholden-- more insufficient measures on helathcare, education and the environment to protec rapacious corporations and their billionaire overlords seem to be the pattern.\nYou are talking about a candidtate who gave Trump military increases beyond what was asked for and who gave a standing ovation to Trump in a pushback against Bernie over  \"socialism.\" There would be no Trump without Obama's tepid half measures and abandonment of his proposed platform. We don't need to repeat this cycle, and I really have m,y doubts about Warren even being electable.",

Sexist men act directly towards<b>  sexual</b> encounters with women they like. For men, it is a \"numbers game\". Women'<b> s sexis</b>m manifests as the inability to treat men regardless of their physical attractiveness under any circumstances, with the goal to remove unattractive men from the society, and maintain only attractive men in their social circles, so that only those men have a chance to approach them. In other words, in case of women it is a \"control game\". Both of those modes <b> of sexi</b>sm are purely biologically driven, a part of the basic reproductive strategy. Men are simply predisposed to approach as many women as possible. Women are simply predisposed to remove insufficiently attractive men from their surroundings. I hear and see women harass unattractive male colleagues, or flirt unsolicitedly with attractive colleagues especially superiors, many times a day (and no, most men do not like that, especially if dealing with subordinates). That<b>  is sex</b>ism too, and it is never punished, even though the rules are supposed to apply no matter<b>  the ge</b>nder. If the rules were applied equally, all several hundreds of my female colleagues unde<b> r th</b>e age of 40 would be fired in a week.",

It's obvious that people liking pizza over the murder of their fellow human beings is nowhere in the same galaxy...but then again... that's something you just can't read between the lines of or something that attributes to your loaded questions. (Which is a pretty weak sauce way to try and draw out a response, because since the question is loaded, no matter how someone answers it, it's still going to delve into another loaded question. As you are doing now). Certain personality types are attracted to certain parties and affiliations. That includes being completely confused between the difference of pizza and murder as a personal preference. \n\n\u00a0Aware or unaware of your projections, it's still unbearable. Pick your poison. I'd rather pick none, because I want<b>  nothing</b> to do with the self aware or the ignorant on the right. But since you have shown evidence that you indeed know you are projecting, that little \"I may or may not be aware\" trick falls flat on it's face. If you were ignorant, that would imply that you just don't know any better, but the manner in which you replied to my OP, you do know better. \n\nIf I have a paradigm of<b>  \"sexis</b<b> >m/raci</b>sm/homophobia/greed\" is that qualitatively no different than if I have a paradigm of \"equality/multi cultural understanding / social justice / sustainability and deep self reflection\"?\n\nNo, because the former tears people down while the latter benefits everyone. If you want to be a proud, horrid slab of a human being fine, but don't expect others to take it or stand for it or be quiet about it. You can cry about how they might \"thinkyourbettern'me\" all day long, but then again, there's that projection again, and you just admitted. Oof. =.=\nYes, a paradigm is but a set of ideas or a way of thinking, and though the two sides have their own ideas, the idea aspect is where the similarities end. Pizza over murder or not.\n\nExactly what triggered you about me being agai<b> nst rac</b><b> ism, se</b>xism, greed and no compassion? Then that says a lot about your character. I get it, going by tons on online posts and other people from the right who talk to me on a daily basis, it doesn't make you exactly popular with society at large, and you may have suffered from isolation or loss of job or something because you did/said something you really shouldn't have and could have totally been avoided. Posse<b> ssing r</b>acist, sexist or discriminatory, divisive blowhard traits doesn't generally make you a likable person, and people have all right to get the heck out of dodge. Not because they think they're \"superior\", it's because people deserve to live in peace and without a hateful, chaotic little spud ruining everything, and making everything awkward and sowing seeds of division just because they can. If you are a terrible person, relish in your isolation and people avoiding you. Gather up the like-minded friends you may have found and stick with them. It's the path you chose, and trying to guilt and shame people with false pretenses of projected \"superiority\" and pizza=murder is beyond sad.",

It's not \"ignorant\" to point out that fact. It's like you have a thing against people pointing out the obvious. If me saying how many people on the right wing obviously operate triggers you, then I can't help you there. \n\n\"Yes, obviously I'm ignorant, look at that.\" No, as I said earlier, pointing out the problem, and pointing out that you are indeed self aware to the problem, then doing it anyway doesn't take away from the situation or even make it a trump card, a revelation or \"deep.\" It's still bad. \n\nMe being against those horrid traits doesn't make me \"ignorant in similar ways.\" So pulling the whole \"we are alike\" thing just doesn't fly. I didn't miss anything here. You were just being facetious and littering bated questions everywhere and it didn't exactly go according to plan. \n\nIf you are indeed more \"left wing\" than I am, and are trying so much to prove that to make me \"feel bad\" or something because a person who views racist/sexist/homophobic/empathy-lacking traits as a-ok, and so happens to be in the left-wing party. If that's your goal, then it's futile, because not everyone in the left wing party is clean from those negative viewpoints, but the people on the right wing certainly got that in spades. No party is perfect, but I am very much for the Dems/left wing. Those are my people. If you are \"more left\",  that's your business, just because you may have tried to pull a surprise \"reveal\" (not really) doesn't mean we are alike or have to agree on the same things. It doesn't mean we have to go linking arms and feeling \"superior\" to those on the right, which you have so graciously dubbed as \"them\". We all know what you meant by \"them.\" The antithesis of the left. please don't play <b> dumb,</b> it's not becoming of you, and it's insulting. But don't think it's of any real shock or revelation to me. So I'll advise you to find another tactic outside of the<b>  old</b>  \"we're not so different, you and I, even if I am ignorant, we're all ignorant here.\" Your response alone was a reaction to me being against negative attributes that negatively affect everyone. If you are indeed against them as well, great, if not, and you're just here to try and play Topsy Turvy, Backwards Opposite day, then I don't got anything for you. I get it, the right wing/libertarians needs to pull a few tricks to make it seem like they are not \"so bad\" in order to appeal to the left wing... even telling Dems and left wingers that they \"really aren't left wing\" in order to make a point. I will admit the new school is making vast strides and cover ups to appeal palatable to those on the left who might be swayed easily. But it's not going to work on me. It's too bad they failed to check their negative traits they revere so much at the door.\n\nIt's not about feeling superior to the right, or the \"supposed\" fellow people on the left. If you feel you are indeed more left wing than I am on some things, just how does that add or take away from my original post? It doesn't.",

It was a primary focus in the order of my first statement,while it's clear that the \"Must be hard trying so hard to hide their nature while denying it at the same time\" was not even the secondary focus. It was more a closing. Because people with unfavorable intentions are finding it harder to fit into polite society, or dealing with most people out there wanting anything to do with them. They have to hide, minimize, However, it's obvious that stuck out for you, it's just That's further made evident by the fact that the first thing you responded to me with was a facetious, \"not like those \"other\" unenlightened, inferior losers, amirite \"fellow\" leftie?\" It was a baited question designed from the ground up to get me to agree with your \"hopefully\" unified claims of superiority with another \"like minded\" person. And as soon as I did, you'd go \"a-ha\", and pull a whole \"we're not so different, and feeling superior to others isn't so bad, now is it?\"\n\n\n*When (at least from my memory), this was the part I was responding to:\n\"Must be hard trying so hard to hide their nature while denying it at the same time.\"*\nYou don't have to remember anything. You pressing the issue of superiority over and over again is right there all over the thread. Which leads to something else that explains it later. \n\n\nIt was me saying \"Yeah, I really resonate with the idea that I am self aware to my own nature and don't deny it. However, since it bugs me when other people believe things which seem self evidently incoherent to me, it very likely means that I am just projecting onto others my own disowned lack of coherence and uncomfortably with my own shadow.\"\n\nBeing self aware, acknowledging the issue, yet continuing to do and support the issue or questionable nature anyways with no intent to do something about it isn't a solid endpoint. It excuses <b> nothing,</b> and it doesn't soften the root issue any less. It doesn't really matter too much if it bugs you that people point out harmful views and actions, or they point out the \"poor, misunderstood\" people who see the most basic modern human decency as \"incoherent. \" Not only that, you set your first answer up to have some kind of faux comradery in being superior to the \"others\", which is clearly what you have been all along by the things you say. Oh, and you honestly don't think I've seen what you had to say to others in the comments, and the nature of your other statements before and after you replied to me? Because I've read just about everybody's comments in this fairly new and low comment video. Really now. I wasn't going to say anything about them, but you continue to literally claim and feign ignorance. We are not on the same side, so drop the act of pretend, drop the act of not understanding the \"paradoxes\" of basic \"fundamental things such as fair behaviours and confusing equality\", and I'll ask you for the last time to stop insulting my intelligence. We aren't on the same side, and trying your best to make sense of your disbelief in equality or non sexist<b> /racist</b<b> >/homophobi</b>c people\n\nThis is beyond just simple self depreciation in a vague attempt to pull an \"oopsie daisy.\" Something in the passage about horrid people having to downplay, hide, suppress or justify their incompetencies to be decent human beings stirred something. Why? Though it's rather silly of me to ask, because you make that answer clear many times. You know how you and people like you are pretty much social pariahs, which is why your knee jerk reaction was to go all, \"You think yer better n me? So you admit it?\" But then you want to flip and pull the self depreciation shtick. \nSelf depreciation isn't substantial or cute and doesn't add to anything. \n\n*You said \"not everyone in the left wing party is clean from those negative viewpoints\".\nI think it is not possible for a human to exist in 2019 and be literally \"clean\" of those viewpoints (sexism/racism/homophobia etc).\nJust like it isn't possible for a human to literally be \"clean\" of things that religion describes as \"sin\", or to literally be \"clean\" of things which modernity describes as \"irrational\".*\nBelieve it or not, there are human beings out there who hold no ill will of the sexis<b> t, raci</b>st<b>  or homopho</b>bic variety towards their fellow man. They're practically everywhere. We live with them, work with them, and meet them in the streets, in our families and online and I am doubly sure to make certain that they are the primary people in my circle of friends, because we are just the most compatible. We're out there, it's just some people want to deny or try doubly hard to draw out something that's just not there. I think it's sad there's people who don't believe people can be free of baseless and useless animosity towards people they don't know, and over something they cannot change or didn't ask to be. \nI don't care what religions have to say about sin. Used as an analogy or not, you don't need religion to goad you to become a decent human being and maintain your decency, taking it one day at a time. For some, being decent comes natural, some others it takes a little more work, and others just say \"screw this decent human being shit.\" We're all different with different goals, affiliations and aspirations. You made you path in life and I made mine, and I can tell you there's no way in the world that I will ever be open to yours, nor am I looking to change people like you. We are just too incompatible.\n\n\n*People with traditional values are trying to jam reality into a relatively simplistic set of values that are not sufficient for modern life, let alone a networked global society. The tools are not up to the job though.\nLikewise with modern capitalistic/scientific values. They are more sophisticated and nuanced, but insufficient.\nLikewise with postmodern/progressive/equality/compassion/multicultural based values. They are another step up in complexity and nuance and degree of love and acceptance. However, they too are insufficient for the challenge of solving the global scale problems that humanity now faces.*\n\"Traditionalist\" values are just not my thing. I'm not tied down by the dead who are still telling me what to do with my life because x, y, z. If you want to live that way fine, but I generally don't seek out traditionalists for companionship. I don't hate them or think I'm better, there's <b> just not</b>hi<b> ng in c</b>ommon,and then there's the fact most try to worm their way into your life and \"enlighten \" you on their boorish traditional values,even disguise them as something palatable for who they view as \"liberals. \" Pass.  I stand firmly behind scientific values, but if someone wants to run off faith, that's their business. But keep it away from me, schools,daycare, and law. It's of 0% interest to me. Global scale problems? Unless you are trying to get to multi CULT uralism, immigration, scary brown folks, mixed babies, women outside of the kitchen, bids of hippie global warming and animal cruelty, oil shortages, planned parenthood, people accepting evilution, and not blindly accepting the Jebus, I don't exactly see the sky falling like you may do. If you see those as \"problems\", I say good. Those \"sickly\" multicultural/equality/compassion/progressive values that keep you up at night are what caused your own version of a \"global crisis \", and I'll be honest, I don't care one tiny bit. Either catch up, or go into isolation with the rest who think like you. But I'm sure you are beyond self aware that no one's going to shed a tear because you're scared shitless of other people and cultures and treat them accordingly cuz \"paradoxes, maaan.\" You're not a misunderstood victim, and lashing out at people who don't feel that way and claiming they think they are superior to you doesn't make it better.",

If you want to extend that to how you treat others, fine. I'm not the one in your company, and most people aren't going to settle for that. No one who isn't an<b>  alien</b> or jus<b> t weir</b>d wakes up and says to themselves, \"hum\u2026 how can I be better in character than another specific target person?\" They strive to be good people for themselves and for the benefit of others, and true goodness and kindness does so without thoughts of reward, attention, rubbing it in people's faces or to brag about it. I'm not a believer in religion, but I am a business owner and I am very competitive. Capitalism may not be perfect, but to date, it's the only system that has worked better than all the others, and my living is made from the needs of others who have no time or knowledge to make the goods they seek for themselves. Yes, I am 100% for capitalism, I grew up in a rich family, but I'm not greedy. I use what I need and give to others frequently. I have all the money I'll ever need, and because of that, being greedy at this point makes no sense to me. But you have people richer than me who just want more, more and more. I'm all about making money, but I'm also all about sharing. \n\n\n*To me, it is self evident that this paradox is at the core of the postmodern framework, including concepts like equality.\nIn a very real sense, only a relatively small percentage of the world's population can comprehend what \"equality\" means.

The contradiction, is that such people have traveled quite high on the hierarchy on what it means to be a full human being.*\n\nIf you don't dig equality, or you think most people don't know what equality is, then whatever, you chose your path in life. If all people of all sexes, races and creeds having an equal shot at the slice of the pie, and being treated fairly and with respect, and are held to the same standards, even if they chose to break from the traditional mold is troubling to, then it's clear to see what side of the fence you're on. I'm not that way. I want everyone out there to be treated fairly, justly, given a sporting chance, and handled with the same level of respect, kindness, recognition, decency and human rights all innocent and peaceful, non chaotic, non destructive and divisive human beings on this planet deserves. I will never settle for anything halfway, disguised as something else, or less. If you think that's \"rare\", then I truly am sorry. \n\n\n*This is what I was responding to with my first comment. What I consider to be an inherent contradiction where people need to deny and reject any concept of \"superiority\", in order to grow more compassionate and loving and move society forward.\nAll the while, hopefully developing a human society which is authentically better than what it is replacing.*\nI don't feel superior to people with different views than mine, because I didn't accomplish anything by doing so. If so, that would be the easiest and most undeserving \"superiority\" trophy ever. No one shares 100% my views, so do I feel superior to them? Everyone else? Of course not. That's not how I am. My views or what party I'm in is not a competition, and I think it's kind of pathetic that anyone would even have the slightest notion that different views equals automatic superiority complex, and legit confusion at those who don't feel that way. There's superior quality fabric, superior tasting food, superior music. I just don't extend that to my fellow human beings. I don't rate humans on some superiority scale like they are some item on EBay. And I know you are also using superiority in another light, and though I knew this was coming, no, I have no interest in forwarding or sponsoring any one of \"those\" kinds of supremacist groups. They all are disgusting and leave a dreadful taste in my mouth due to the upcoming puke. No thanks. No, they're not cuddly and misunderstood, and no, people don't got them all wrong. I wa<b> nt nothi</b>ng to do with such people. Yes, turning a cold shoulder to such groups and their way of thinking has been proven to foster more compassion and love in society. If that thought is like water to the Wic<b> ked Wi</b>tch of the West, then good. \n\"All the while, hopefully developing a human society which is authentically better than what it is replacing.\"\nSorry, the \"you will not replace us\" and tiki torch video is thataway. \u27a1\n\nThat paradox needs to be denied and hidden, otherwise the \"whole party would fall apart\".

T<b> here's n</b>othing wrong wit<b> h b<b> e</b</b>>ing gay, they is something wrong holding something someone can't hope to control against them. Being a shitty human being is a choice, who you are attracted to is a whole other field. What I mean by \"the whole party would fall apart\" is that if the Right just up and abandoned the \"virtues\" they deny, but are well known for, they would be virtually unrecognizable. That is what fall apart in that setting means.<b>  That ha</b>s nothing to do with someone struck with cognitive dissonance, cuz they are in a party famously known for not trusting a demonic/unnatural virus c<b> all<b> e</b</b>>d \"the gay\".\n\n\n*I am under the illusion, that it is possible to have a coherent and non contradictory worldview.\nHowever, it also seems apparent that humans are not coherent creatures.*\n\nIf you are illusioned, then... Bravo? Yes, it's possible to have both a coherent and non contradictory worldview, it's just your idea of contractions are way off. Humans can be coherent. You see examples of that everyday. If we were not, we'd be mush brained vegetables with no tastes, opinions, feelings, problem solving, or desire or motor skills, or any sense of our surroundings or the people around us. Geeze, real emo level shot of one who not only self depreciates, but also wants all of humanity to join in on the little sad side show. \n\nSo my first message to you, included me mocking myself for being under the illusion that it is literally possible to be coherent and aware of your own true nature as a human.\nAgain, self depreciation doesn't get you a pass.",

It's also bs. \u00a0\nRight now, in this election, it has more to do with quirky - very quirky timing. \nTens of millions of us would welcome a female pres. Without a thought as to her <b> sex.</b> Unfortunately, the creepy people and history we've all been subjected to in recent decades (everything from WMD...I did not have<b>  sexual</b> relations...\"Yes We Can\" [fraud of all frauds...]...to the Chump of all chumps...) has left all of us...ALL OF US vomiting over anyone who's feckless nature shows; whether from 'under their skirt' or from behind invitation only ridiculous neoliberal/neocon money/donor whoring.\nTherefore, many of us have become - not \"purists,\" but \"...you are either 100% legit - and you have the receipts - or you ain't get'n shit from me - and in fact you're fair game for complete political annihilation by any means it comes about: whether man o<b> r woma</b>n...\nThere are the extremists on both sides to be sure. But in general, it's not \"hate\" of a candidate because of their genitalia. It's just raw - carpet bombing hate of everything we've come to expect of 99.9% of these massively flawed persons(have had proven to us). \u00a0\nAnd if you could see inside peoples' central nervous systems, it is why Bernie Sanders has the remarkably deep-seated embrace by so many. And it's super easy to prove that such embrace is unique to that of others:\nBecause unlike virtually any leader since the likes of Mandela and his ilk, Sanders's loyalist stay with him year after year after year. They grown in number. And they grow in clarity of their understanding of \"the times,\" and quickly see how Sanders stands out because he stands firm...resolute...transparent.\nIn other words, it is precisely because of these very \"quirky\" times that we are all living through right now that (ironically) also \"exposes\" Sanders's \"true colors\" where virtually every other \"leader\" eventually has their fatal blemishes show from under their \"make-up\" or their \"plastic surgery or false teeth\" and their simplistic ideas around handing out money, etc.\nSo while there are clowns in cabs you catch rides with that obviously have some OBVIOUS unmet needs - and thus some OBVIOUS perverse ideologies, the greater truth is simple:\u00a0\n<b> No wom</b>an Mandela is among us at this moment. No female Gandhi is proving transcendent.\n<b> \nNo wo</b>man is saying: \"I will lose to bring a true victory, before I will win to deliver a false one.\"\n\nToday, the only \"leader\" among us who even deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence as the aforementioned icons, is Bernie Sanders. And thank God for that. Because absent him, it'd be a shit-show on a scale that would leave an entire country suffering from PTSD.",

Tulsi Gabbard definitely does represent the political nobility of present female candidates with prominent merits to be considered a female iconoclast.  I understand your disclosure is subjective towards your own beliefs and perception but that does not mandate an affirmative recognition from \"among us\" on behalf of \"the only\" array. Taking the narrow-minded steps to procure the connotation that there are no \"<b> woman </b>Mandela\"s or \"Ghandi\"s, doesn't warrant a \"greater truth\" because that is a biased narrative constructed upon an individual's values as they relate to those prestigious figures; much more the fact that there are no male icons to fill those roles currently today either; so by that comparison, there aren't any exclusions to pick leaders by<b>  sex</b> affiliated world renowned models. Bernie Sanders certainly doesn't do it.  Though it may not be known by the majority or maybe just not acknowledged, Bernie Sanders has played his card in undermining what some perceive to be the most important subject of their voting, reparations. He's not only diverted his rhetoric away from the subject but he has taken so much of an aggressive stance to remove people who bring up the subject. Between the two(Tulsi & Bernie), it is objectively pronounced that Tulsi represents a more surreal case of loosing to bring a true victory, as her experience with life and death for the sake of protecting others' freedoms and lives proves this; a caliber that Bernie Sanders has never experienced and cannot represent. In addition to the fact that she is currently being hushed by whatever exploitative forces currently acting to keep her from her victory, yet she pushed on; and through her pursuit of victory, she has yet to falter to dismissing subjects that are paramount to a considerable amount of people yearning to be uplifted by the next national leader.  Tulsi Gabbard, nearly by her own oratory, has projected the concept of \"I will lose to bring a true victory, before I will win to deliver a false one.\"; she may the candidate who has done it the most.",

A loss in debate is expected and critically reviewed for improvement but an action that publicly has someone removed from an event for asking political question warrants suspicion upon those who permit such activities.  I guess at most, Tulsi has pejorative debating circumstances but never has she had security remove civilians from public occasions for requesting answers.

Even if that were true, and you want to go full blown sexist and want to exclude the oh so infallible men from that possibl<b> e gende</b>r based voting (which they can totally do,  a trip to stormfront and reddit will show that),<b>  a wom</b>an would be even more retarded voting for Trump on his character alone, never mind his blaring incompetence. But the real disappointment are the women who were behind the men saying \"trump that bitch. \" Women self haters are useless, and their right wing men only find the women's vote useful if the women are voting for the exact candidate they tell them to vote for obediently and with a smile. If the women don't be good little girls and comply, these same type of men will be more than gleeful if they ever get a chance to take the right of women to vote away...followed by minorities...followed by liberals...followed by gays... followed by non xtians, you get the idea. It would be North Korea if they had their way. They have a ballot vote only comprised of the \"right\" people, and one runner up, but surprise, surprise...guess who totally wins again? \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44",

Even Emma who asked Elizabeth how her vote for Trump's military budget squared with her supposed progressivism, later commented \"just address them(these inconsistencies), it would be so much clearer for all of us, and then we can move forward\". Emma with that statement, made the fact that she voted that way and then dodged the question not that big of a deal. I think this all happening because of two things: access and who they perceive has a better chance at winning.",

It's like men are afraid to find out women were better than them all along, and that women will start treating them the way women have been treated for thousands of years. We all bring different strengths and weaknesses to the table, we need to work together to be at our best. Men tend to divide themselves, but women tend to draw us together. They are often the glue that binds the family together. I think we need a female president, one that will unite and not divide us. One that will bring new insight to the problems at hand.

Those who practice it you don't want in any office. I don't care what your faith is<b>  nobody</b> has a right to tell you what to do with your body but you and you alone has to deal with the consequences of that choice! But remember that choice you made if you have a baby plan and be sure you can afford to take care of it a long time,  a lot of deadbeats out there!

Not one person I have ever met has even eluded to the idea that men can't be good leaders and that women should run everything. \n\nWould I encounter someone like that, I would probably have the same reaction though, as I am aware of many women who have abused their power for personal and political gain or just failed outright to do a decent job regardless of how competent they initially seemed.  More so the former than the latter, as more often than not women don't get the chance to lead if they could even be perceived as incompetent when compared with their male counterparts.\n\nA good leader isn't defined by <b> gender.</b>  They aren't good leaders in spite of it either. A good leader is someone who can do the job well, full stop.",

I would say that it's you forming a hypothesis, but I'm guessing you don't plan to actually conduct the study under reasonable scientific conditions.\nThird, by leaving out any ambiguity through asking how the people FEEL the world would be in your scenario, you're asking them to attempt to factually answer a question that there is no reasonable data to infer from; as that situation has never actually been even close to a reality.\nIt's all just bad science aimed at showing a perceived bias that may or may not exist based on an extremely limited data set.\n\n\nIgnoring all that, I doubt the majority would answer \"better.\"  More likely the majority would answer \"same\" but you would ignore that set and only focus on the people who answered \"worse\" or \"better\" to fit your narrative.

She is also said she is going to take the big donor money in the general which will be a total, because she will not be able to take the positions she will need to take to win because those donors are going to limit the positions she can take. He ground game is weak as can be compared to Bernie and she will not be able to compete without that limiting big donor cash. She is the establishment's last chance to avoid Bernie at this point \nI could go on and on with reasons why Warren is a huge loser for 2020, but I'm  just going to tell TYT to stop trying to shove Warren on us.

Many stories throughout history depict women who strive to achieve power as somehow evil or only interested in their own goals, rather than helping those who they would come to lead.  The problem is compounded by a learned culture which sees women demonize each other for being perceived as more successful or attractive.  The fact that you haven't already picked up on this in your day to day life shows that you probably don't actually care about the reasons behind it and explaining it is pointless, but I thought I'd try to give it a go anyway.",

Bernie ran in 2016 and Warren didn't, so name recognition is a mute point to many young voters. However, I would be lying if I said the gamer community (the base of Yang's support) is full of respectable young men who never discriminate against women. Lol. So I'm definitely not dismissing <b> sexism </b>as a factor in Yang's case. But I think Bernie's base is too diverse to try to make that claim.",

Is menopause a myth in America, even among women?\nBesides, testosterone is every bit as 'dangerous' as any female hormone could be. For every case of PMS-induced violence there are many, many more cases of violence by men against women.  Just look at the rage monster Trump was and still is... and so many other male politicians... and non-politicians.\nHeck, while we're at it you can point to the Y-chromosome as a potential disqualifier for political candidacy given t<b> he gend</b>er differences in crime rates, especially violent crimes, large-scale crimes and repeat offenders.  Sorry men, the fact that I'm a man won't stop me from speaking that statistical truth.\nI get why men can cling to discriminatory and incorrect beliefs about women, but why other women?  Why do American women have such archaic and just plain false attitudes towards other women?  Is it just a case of politics overriding sense?  Is it projection by women who have those issues themselves so assume all women do?  Or is it deeper than that?",

He has a sweeping generalization for every occasion--provided he's making fun of certain groups & giving others a pass, of course.\n* Here's one thing that Warren can do to improve her polling:  stop her frenetic arm gestures.

They respond to a deeper voice, a louder voice and your physical size.   Many different statistics reflect these facts.   Tall people do better in negotiations and earn more on average.   The taller presidential candidate normally wins.   This offends me as a rational person, but I have to accept it is true.   It is not sexist to recognize that Elizabeth Warren with her small stature and weak voice simply won't do as well as Bernie Sanders in a debate against a bully like Trump.  Too many people will have an instinctive, gut reaction that Warren is weak and not a leader no matter how derange Trump's words may be.  Life is not fair.",

Companies like Facebook, Google, and Yahoo have women in executive positions. Someone not being given the opportunity to lead does not mean that they are incapable of leading. Just like having a position of power doesn't mean that you should or that you're good at it.",

                    "commentText": "@Andrew Cash so that goes to my point about those titles and positions having as much \"power\" as you're willing to give it....I don't respect \"world leaders\" or politicians for the very fact they believe they have a legitimate authority to rule over you and can tell you what you need or what's best for your life. It takes a special type of narcissist and sycophant to want to take a position like that and I refuse to respect them.......Theresa May has held up <b> Brexit </b>because she didn't like the outcome of the \"vote\", Merkel Opened the borders which led to the K\u00f6ln disaster and a growing issue with immigrants there, the new Zealand PM literally not too long ago told her people \"owning guns is privilege not a right, and it's the job of a \"responsible government\" to restrict access to certain things and change \"problems\" with more legislation\"......now regardless of how you lean on those issues this is no better or \"caring\" than what any male would've done. They're just as tyrannical and dangerous in my book.....Facebook, Google, yahoo, cool they're \"inclusive\" by hiring females to certain high positions but these companies STILL contribute to certain nefarious activities can we agree? So the<b>  gender</b> has had no \"better effect\" when it comes to leading people into a better future.......and the biggest issue I have (and I told this to a feminist in a convo I had considering equality and wage gaps) why do we ONLY see this fight in Air conditioned jobs? If they're \"just as capable\" then show us, and apply for some of the most dangerous jobs. Logging, roofing, even underwater welding and sanitation....NONE of these fields where the danger level is higher (which also pay damn good money) and contains real physical labor do we see the same energy when it comes to \"inclusion\" and wanting to be represented. Only the positions where there's an authoritative title that \"gets respect\".......this is one thing that typically goes unaddressed. So many people (men and women) want the \"respect\" and \"accolades\" but don't want to EARN it. I'm sure you'd take issue with a male believing he should be \"owed\" a certain position or level of respect because of genitals or title, I'm just applying that across the board, if you want the respect then you have to earn it, don't claim victim and \"shame\" people into getting what you want....those female \"leaders\" you named all earned their spots and they're JUST as shitty as any other politician so if more women want that then more power to them but remember those 3 women you also don't hear \"because I'm <b> a woma</b>n\" coming from them either. There's a level of entitlement here that they don't have in Europe that turns many people off and claimin<b> g \"sexi</b>sm\" is a way of avoiding the truth",
