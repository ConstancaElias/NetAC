        "postText": "Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have both refused to condemn Donald Trump\u2019s offensive remarks about four US congresswomen as \u2018racist\u2019.', 'The former and current foreign secretaries went head-to-head in their final debate before the Conservative Party decides who will be next in Number 10.', 'On Sunday, Trump tweeted that he thought four US congresswomen should \u2018go back\u2019 to the \u2018broken and crime infested places from which they came\u2019.', 'The Tory leadership rivals both said they agreed with Theresa May\u2019s condemnation of the remarks made by the US president on Twitter as \u2018completely unacceptable\u2019.', 'While Mr Trump did not name the four, he is believed to have been referring to congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib.', 'All were born in the United States, except Ms Omar who was born in Somalia and came to the US as a refugee.', 'Asked about the comments Mr Johnson said: \u2018If you are the leader of a great multiracial, multicultural society you simply cannot use that kind of language about sending people back to where they came from.', '\u2018That went out decades and decades ago and thank heavens for that so it\u2019s totally unacceptable and I agree with the Prime Minister.\u2019', 'Pressed on whether the comments were racist, he said: \u2018I simply can\u2019t understand how a leader of that country can come to say it.\u2019', 'Pressed again, he replied: \u2018You can take from what I said what I think about President Trump\u2019s words.\u2019', 'Mr Hunt said the remarks were \u2018totally offensive\u2019, but challenged on whether the remarks are racist, he said it would not be helpful to use such language about the US president.', 'Mr Hunt said: \u2018I have three half-Chinese children, and they are British citizens born on the NHS, and if anyone ever said to them \u201cgo back to China\u201d, I would be utterly appalled.\u2019', 'He added: \u2018I think that, look I\u2019m Foreign Secretary, this is a president of a country which happens to be our closest ally and so it is not going to help the situation to use that kind of language about the president of the United States.', '\u2018I can understand how many people in this country would want politicians like me to use those words and would feel that sentiment but I will make absolutely clear how totally offensive it is to me that people are still saying that kind of thing.\u2019', 'Trump had hit out at the congresswomen \u2018who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world\u2019.', 'He then suggested: \u2018why don\u2019t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came\u2019.', 'His comments led to attacks from senior Democrats, with presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren condemning the \u2018racist and xenophobic attack\u2019.', 'Despite the widespread outrage provoked by his tweets, the president seemed unbothered.', 'Speaking at the White House on Monday he said: \u2018If you\u2019re not happy in the US, if you\u2019re complaining all the time, you can leave, you can leave right now.\u2019', 'He then defended tweet, saying the anger it prompted \u2018doesn\u2019t concern me, because many people agree with me.\u2019",

If he was foaming at the mouth every day during Obama\u2019s presidency and calling him out on everything he did then you might have a point. Granted he slammed him on his run to the whitehouse but what aspiring president has ever been nice to his potential predecessor? Maybe they stopped short at calling him <b> racist </b>because it wasn\u2019t actually<b>  racist</b>? If those words were directed to a congress person of Irish decent would that have bee<b> n racis</b>t?",
