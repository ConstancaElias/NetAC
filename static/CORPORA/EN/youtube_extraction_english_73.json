It is important to remember where we come from and come back to nature and <b> 'old</b> style' if we feel lost. Teamwork is the key to me. We don't need to create a war to see who's better if men or women. We have high intuition as a female and they get better oriented. There are many activities that should be done by each one. Our bodies are designed differently. It's like being ring and shoe size 7 and trying to fit 6 or 8. As <b> a woma</b>n we can go to school, work outside the house, pay our bills, maintain our kids, everything alone and because of that men are not gentlemen anymore. I don't understand how looking for freedom we just lost commitment and kindness. I'm<b>  a wom</b>an, independent, bilingual, with some college and I just would do anything to be treated with respect and kindness<b>  as </b>old women from the past were treated. Women that without going to school, with no liberty, with no knowledge about home activities, I mean doing homework themselves, they got a position in society and lived their lives as it supposed to be at that time. It's so sad to see our future. Maybe we won't speak in future, just push keys on a screen to get what we want. It's depressing. I hope things change and even though money it's very important and keeps order there's still value out there. Nature doesn't cost a cent. It exists to be appreciated, to be lived, and to make us understand the real meaning of life.",

But is there an over-awareness? We are still nowhere near equality. And what shall we (women) do? It affects our lives so much, we face it practically every day! \"She's not cut out to do this and that, she is too gentle\", \"Such a career! She must be a bitch\" etc.\n\n\nI wrote my master thesis in linguistics about the perceived power in male and female speech of characters in a Star Wars animated series. Although all my characters had high positions of power in the Star Wars universe, the perceived power (of us human watchers) was very different. Still a long way to go to reach eye-level.",

I've seen him in many, and his acting immerses me in the film even more. He is definitely one of my favorite actors and I need to see him in more films!!!!",

            "commentText": "Agree with all those super impressed with Salma.  She had great points and she expressed them passionately.  Matthias seemed to have thought a lot less about these issues.  His comments around 19:00 about seeing the human being before identities such as black/white/Asian/Latino or male/female, etc. is tone-deaf.  Criticizing identity politics is something people in positions of privilege often do.  It's easy to be white and male and say \"I just see people, not <b> race,</b><b>  gender</b> etc.\"  Try living wit<b> h racis</b><b> m, sexi</b>sm, transphobia etc on a daily basis.  You don't get a choice about \"just being human\".  Many people put you in a box; THAT is your reality.  As a minority you have to navigate those waters.  For minorities, identity politics is the path to pursue justice and equality.  In short, minorities don't have the privilege to ignore identity politics.  Matthias should question his own privilege and the space he is afforded that others are not to \"see people as humans first.\"  Just my humble opinion, though I think he means well.",

You should watch the ng under another perspective: Matthias can be empathic but of course he will never understand at 100% what it means being a minority, because as you sad he will never be putted in that position, BUT if all people that now are in a \"strong\" position would think as Matthias think, automatically no minorities will never exist, cause in mind there will be only the concept of HUMANITY. I hope it was enough clear, and I think this is what Matthias probably wanted to express, if we first think that we are human and then in a second level we see our diversoty, we will be capable of accept and embrace it.",

In Belgium Tyson was the only boxer we - Matthias' generation - were exposed to. Remember there was no internet so we had what the weekly magazines were offering us, and Tyson and his beautiful wife Robin Givens were darlings of the Belgian press (this changed after the accusations of spousal abuse and rape). I don't like boxing, and I consider myself a feminist, but growing up in Belgium in the 1980s and early 90s Mike Tyson was (what I conceived then as) one of the most glamorous and almost superhuman stars I was exposed to, and I would read about him whenever I had a chance. So when you ask me about people who made an impression on me as a kid I might mention him, as he was how my childhood self imagined America to be: larger than life. This is of course very separate from how I view Tyson now (and I'm shocked to read there will be a film about his life). Just wondering if this could be what Matthias meant...",

                    "commentText": "I think about Matthias as a very sensitive person, at least this was the message that all his interview gaves to me, and all the movie roles he tooks. I saw that interview too, and I can say that at the beginning I remained pretty disappointed when I heard him mentioning Tyson, BUT we should think about it in a more intelligent perspective. We should see Matthias throught his real choices, when he was mature, then when he was a young little boy. Tyson was a role model for a lot of young kids as a BOXER for sure not for his life choices. For concluding I simply think that the choice that he made when he was a kid, doesn't affect who he is as a man, and doesn'gt affect the fact that he always showed up as a very sensible human being with a big curiosity for human types. Don't accuse him of someone he is not, don-t confuse him with someone he looked up when he was a little kid. Judge him based on what he says and which are his real opinion who he spoke about openly.",

But lets face it, it was a pretty sweet career. She even got to make an arty film in Frida. It's the audiences that decide who the successful actors are, not the INDUSTRY. Hayek doesn't draw audiences anymore, and part of it, I think, is her HORRID ACCENT! Start your own studio with other women, or other hispanics, and STOP WHINING! My God, you've had such an easy life, and you still need to fucking whine!",

THis feeling is simply stemming from the fact that most likely you are not used to that accent at all and so are uncomfortable with it, while the same is untrue of American accents. As an <b> Indian,</b> I find American accents incredibly annoying simply because I'm not used to them. That does not mean its fair to say that they must have my accent in my country or I must get their accent in their country. USA accents are seen as less annoying only because of the fact that Hollywood is huge all over the world, and people can get used to American accents by watching films. But<b>  nobody</b> except one of that sam<b> e nationalit</b>y watch films of their own country. I don't think there's anything known as a normal accent. Suggesting that people better get used to talking \"American\" in America only creates one bland accent for all instead of the great cultural tapestry of various accents. Diversity is best promoted by identifying these accents and keeping them. They are a part of that country's culture. Kudos to Salma for holding onto her accent. If she wants to keep it, its fine. If people want to change their accent, that's cool too. Just don't suggest that all must try to have one accent.",

Salma knows what the producers in Hollywood want from her and she freely gives it to them because it brings her money - simple as that. That's why I call her a hypocrite, she's living her life by double standards. Then you have women like Meryl Streep or Diane Keaton who are incredibly talented and that's why they still keep getting roles despite their high <b> age.</b> And good roles for aged women in Hollywood are rare because this industry has been running ever since by a bunch of powerful guys with big influence that are thinking with their penis.

            "commentText": "Dear Salma Hayek, I listened to all of your remarks and your observations are surely true and relevant but let's remember the many actresses who made a name on their own no matter how briljant their male counterparts were, they are remembered and not just as a sex-symbol. I'll start the list in the '50: Anna Magnani, Sophia Loren, Gina Lolobridgida,Claudia Cardinale, Giulietta Massini ...( the Italian ones)...Simonne Signoret, Jeanne Moreau, Brigitte Bardot, Danielle Darieux, Catherine Deneuve, Juliette Binoche ...(French)...Romy Schneider...and many others that NO male actor ever had any problem to act with. If I would list the American or British actresses the list would be very large. I think that a lot of male actors - in an eventual leading role or even second role- just always like to work with actresses that meet-up with their notion of what their role in a film asks for. It is not about who they want to kiss or not. If the talent is there they'll jump. Of course I am aware that a lot of talent remains underestimated...that is the same traject for male and female actresses. A real Light can never be kept under the carpet. The female directors are only a few, I agree. But women are not inclined as much as men to go all the way through the difficulties that every moviemaker encounters when presenting their project to (eventual) producers. There are women willing to go all the way. You are one of them. There are briljant female script writers...but are you aware of the amount of briljant male writers who are dismissed just the same way? Male directors that are sent home just the same way female directors are sent home? And yes Matthias Schoenaerts, as a person with <b> common </b>sense and sensitivity, is not making a difference between men or women when reading a script, not making any difference between men and women when the director is pointed out, not making any question about who is gonna be his female costar, because IT IS ALL ABOUT: WHAT IS THE STORY WE wanna tell, HOW WE GONNA tell that story, WILL WE BE ABLE to tell that story HOW IT NEEDS TO BE TOLD.",

                    "commentText": "@Silent Mama I completely agree with you, not as many women are interested in the rigorous work that is FILMMAKING, just as there are less than 5% of women working as garbage collectors. Different professions attract different people, and men face the same problems that women face when trying to become a filmmaker. While there is some discrimination against women in film, it doesn't mean that we should forcefully give women more jobs in filmmaking just for the sake of diversity, because that wouldn't be fair to the countless more men who may be more qualified for the job. I think the job of director, producer, writer, etc. should go to the person who can do the job the best, regardless of whether it's a <b> woman </b>or a man. Since more men are interested in fimmaking in general, it makes sense that in turn, more men are working as filmmakers. The low number of women may in part be because of<b>  sexism</b>, but I don't think it's as big of a setback as people claim it to be; there are simply less women interested in the profession.",

There's no problem with a <b> woman </b>being a<b>  sexual</b> object just like there's no problem with a man being that.\n\nThe problem arise when that's the predominant image and roles regarding women. Salma has taken her clothes off,true but most of that was done when she was young and not as cultivated as she is now. And that's not what she's tried to make her entire career about either so I don't think calling her a hypocrite holds weight. All she did was tell the truth.",
