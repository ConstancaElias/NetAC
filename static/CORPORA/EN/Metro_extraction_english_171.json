        "postText": "Bias is unfair prejudice or discrimination against someone based on an external factor like their skin colour, race, gender or religion.', 'But one type of prejudice that is rarely spoken about is unconscious name bias. It happens all the time and the negative impact can be enormous.', 'Picture the scene. A white, male manager receives a CV with a name at the top. Rather than looking at the reams of experience and qualifications on the CV he gets stuck on the fact that he doesn\u2019t know how to pronounce the applicant\u2019s name. He picks up the next CV. John Smith. You can make an educated guess about who is more likely to get an interview.', 'This scenario is all too common. Minority applicants have to send, on average, 60% more job applications to get a positive response from employers compared to their white counterparts.', 'It\u2019s so common in fact that in 2016 the CBI called for the removal of candidates\u2019 names from job applications to create a more dynamic and diverse workforce.', 'The \u2018unconscious\u2019 part means that this bias is happening unintentionally. Someone will hear a name and if that name doesn\u2019t register as something they recognise or are comfortable with, they may treat them differently without even knowing that they are doing it.', 'It is often related to race. If a name sounds African, Indian or anything non-Western, people may make assumptions about that person or rule them out of opportunities.', 'It manifests as not being considered for interviews despite having all the right experience or being denied on rental applications for no apparent reason.', 'People can make snap judgements about names for other reasons too \u2013 like assuming that someone with a double-barreled surname is privileged or \u2018posh\u2019 \u2013 but it is the racial element that makes this kind of bias so damaging.', 'Julia Bernard-Thompson is a business consultant and is passionate about addressing unconscious bias in the workplace. She is also a Trinidadian immigrant \u2013 something that frequently shocks people after hearing her name.', '\u2018They will say, \u201cYou don\u2019t look like a Julia Bernard-Thompson\u201d, and I\u2019ll say \u201cOh, what does a Julia Bernard-Thompson look like?\u201d And they will flush red because they will realise what they have just said out loud.', '\u2018I want to say \u201cWhat were you expecting? A white woman?\u201d', '\u2018Often, the person who acts out the bias is completely oblivious to the fact that they have just completely discounted that person\u2019s culture, history and upbringing.', '\u2018A person\u2019s name is the first thing you ask anybody, anywhere, in any circumstances. It is even the first thing that you learn when you\u2019re learning a new language \u2013 hello, my name is\u2026', '\u2018So if we can\u2019t address and acknowledge people\u2019s humanism on such a basic, basic level, then what hope do we have?\u2019', 'Your name is something that, usually, you have no say in choosing. It is something that is given to you by your parents. It is usually imbibed with meaning that is unique to you and your family, so to have that used against you can be incredibly hurtful.', 'Unconscious bias \u2013 in any form \u2013 is particularly insidious. It perpetuates racial discrimination and is really difficult for victims to call out because the perpetrators don\u2019t even know they are doing it. But ignorance is not an excuse.', 'Julia thinks it\u2019s vital that employers and people in all forms of power make an effort to check their unconscious behaviour.', '\u2018You have to call it out,\u2019 she says. \u2018In yourself and in others where you can. With any kind of bias, you have to be willing to look at your own behaviour.', '\u2018If someone introduces themselves and they have an unusual name \u2013 do not shorten the person\u2019s name to something more English or easier for you to say. That\u2019s not how they introduced themselves.', '\u2018Own up to the fact that you will probably mispronounce their name. Ask them how to pronounce and tell them that you want to get it right. Ask them how their mother pronounces their name. People really appreciate that attempt and the acknowledgement that your name is important to you.', '\u2018Like anything, if you admit that it is a problem, and you show willing to address the problem, then people are usually willing to help you to address the problem and that\u2019s how it gets solved.\u2019', '\u2018It\u2019s such a simple thing to take the extra time, to have someone spell out their name for you. It really isn\u2019t that difficult and it could really make a world of difference too people feeling seen and valued.\u2019', 'The financial impact of unconscious name bias is real. As well as missing out on potential professional opportunities, a report in The Sun last year found that a car insurance applicant named Mohammed was quoted hundreds of pounds more than one called John. In fact, five insurance companies quoted Mohammed between \u00a3205 and \u00a3919 more.', 'Ifeoluwa Victoria Oladele, who now goes by Victoria, says name bias is something that she\u2019s experienced at various levels of employment.', '\u2018The higher up I go, the more I expect it to be the norm,\u2019 she explains. \u2018I have completely given up on providing my full name, so I just say the shorthand.', '\u2018It started in primary school. My whole name was on the register but I never got called by it. I was just called Vicky, because it\u2019s what they could pronounce out of the list.', '\u2018It\u2019s funny because being African, you can have several names and the family pick and choose what they want but they respect all of them. At work, they don\u2019t attempt to know the meaning and they pick what\u2019s convenient for them.\u2019', 'Victoria feels so strongly about this issue that she co-authored a children\u2019s book empowering children to get to know the meaning of their own name.', 'She says: \u2018It stems from stigma and a lack of willingness to learn or pronounce your name correctly.', '\u2018Unless you\u2019re famous, your \u201cforeign sounding name\u201d gets no respect.\u2019', 'Antonina Mamzenko\u2019s name is Russian and Ukranian. She says she has always suspected that her name played in part in the lack of responses she got from job applications after graduating.', '\u2018I remember applying for jobs after finishing my Master\u2019s degree here in the UK and even though I was definitely more than qualified and my CV was in top shape, I almost never heard back or got invited for interviews.', '\u2018I could only assume it was my name and was half-considering applying for jobs under an alias to see if it was the case (I never did do that \u2013 but it would have been a great experiment!).', '\u2018It was very frustrating to say the least and really undermined my confidence. It was the first time I had experienced bias like that.\u2019', 'Antonina started up her own photography business nine years ago and those fears about unconscious bias came back to her as she thought about attracting new customers.', '\u2018I considered creating a more \u201cBritish\u201d sounding alias or a \u201cneutral\u201d company name,\u2019 she explains.', '\u2018Luckily, I never found anything that felt more \u201cme\u201d than my own name, so I stuck with it. And even though it was tricky in the beginning while I was still finding my feet and confidence, I\u2019m really happy that I stuck with it.', '\u2018It allowed me to build a strong personal brand and attract a very open-minded and international client base.\u2019', 'Headteacher struck off for swindling school funds to pay for staff parties', 'Tackling unconscious bias \u2013 in all its forms \u2013 is critical if we are to destabilise the hierarchies of power that continue to limit the progression and advancements of minorities.', 'Julia says that an acknowledgement of the issue is the first step and removing the \u2018unconscious\u2019 element of this ind of bias is the only way to dismantle it.', '\u2018In a utopian world, in a future reimagined, bias, discrimination or prejudice including \u201cnamism\u201d wouldn\u2019t exist. But it does and admitting it exists means examining our reaction to different, to other,\u2019 says Julia.', '\u2018It means being honest with ourselves and with the conclusions we come to when we see a name that is unusual to us.\u2019', 'You can here more of Julia\u2019s thoughts about unconscious name bias in her Ted Talk.",
