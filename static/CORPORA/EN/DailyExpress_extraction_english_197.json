        "postText": "'Following Mr Farage\u2019s shock announcement that he was stepping down 317 candidates in constituencies won by the Conservative Party in 2017, Express.co.uk conducted a poll asking readers who they would vote for in light of the development. While nearly three quarters of respondents said they would give Boris Johnson\u2019s party their vote, many expressed their disappointment at Mr Farage\u2019s decision and vowed not to vote on December 12 because there would be no Brexit Party candidate to back.', 'When this point was put to Mr Farage, he quickly turned on the Conservatives, saying they would be to blame if cheesed off Brexit supporting Britons staged a no-show at the election.', 'Mr Farage told Express.co.uk: Well that is very interesting and this is something that I thought about.', 'So, had the Conservatives given a degree of reciprocity and it had been seen to be, albeit informal, a bit of an alliance - Leave alliance - then I think Brexit Party voters in those 317 constituencies would have thought \u2018that\u2019s great, it works\u2019.', 'But I think, very interesting at the moment, what I am seeing this morning, is a lot of Brexit Party voters considering whether they are going to vote at all and I wonder whether the Conservatives will question their attitude towards me over the last few days.', 'The Brexit Party leader was speaking at a rally in Ilford, east London, on Wednesday where he railed against Mr Johnson\u2019s refusal to withdraw candidates from 300 opposition-held constituencies where he is campaigning.', 'He said the Conservatives\u2019 stance had convinced him they are afraid of what his party could do if its members were elected to Parliament.', 'It\u2019s they who refuse to work with us and I think one of the reasons is they genuinely fear us, he told reporters.', 'When asked if the Tories were risking Brexit by their unwillingness to budge on his demands, Mr Farage replied: Yes, they are. In a sense they are.', 'Mr Farage rejected the Tories suggestion he would be held responsible if a Leave majority was not delivered, and accused Mr Johnson of splitting the Brexit vote.', 'The former UKIP leader said he had given his life\u2019 s work to getting Brexit and said it was madness the Tories would rather risk a hung Parliament than guarantee a Leave - supporting majority.', ' He added: I made a massive gesture this week, big gesture, which actually didn\u2019 t delight all Brexit Party supporters, I have to say, because they can\u2019 t all vote for us and they\u2019 re a bit cheesed off.And I get that. ', ' Mr Farage urged the prime minister to give up on his hope of winning in constituencies where the Tories have not enjoyed a victory in years, saying the main challenger to Labour would be his own party. ', ' Suzanne Watson was among those who turned up at the rally to cheer Mr Farage on because she believes Boris cannot be trusted.', ' The 66 - year - oLd from Bishop\u2019 s Stortford is a former UKIP supporter and praised Mr Farage\u2019 s motivation and brains.', ' She told Express.co.uk: I don\u2019 t think we should be joined to Europe.I think we should be looking after our own. ', ' I was in UKIP previously.I didn\u2019 t like it when the right - wing guys, the heavy handed guys, came in ;I was in it purely for Brexit. ', 'With immigration, I think our country is too small, we cannot take in too many people.It\u2019 s nothing to do with racism, we just don\u2019 t have enough doctors and schools. ', 'I think stopping it with Brexit will be good but it\u2019 s almost like shutting the gate after the horse has bolted.'",
