We're literally just a bunch of people, scattered over some places of the world.\nDo you have something against me for being a jew? You don't even know me.\nTo be honest I don't care whether you're jewish, muslim, buddhist, or whatever. We're all humans. We all need to get over the hate and spread some love instead. That's how wars will eventually stop too, when the hate will turn into love. \nAnyway sorry for that long comment lol and have a great day wherever u are <3",

Arabs are Semitic(people from Middle East) people and Arabic is a semitic language like Hebrew. In facts most Jews are European jews(not ethnically semitic) but are considered semitic because they speak a semitic language(Hebrew) by that logic all Muslims are semitics (even if they aren't from the Middle East). So let's count the islamphopia as anti-semitism  and see how bad anti-semitism is in America's.",

                    "commentText": "George Let's start at the beginning. In 722 BCE, the Northern Kingdom of Israel fell to the Assyrians and the majority of its population was apparently expelled. These are the \"Ten Lost Tribes\". This sort of forced migration seems to be part of standard part of Assyrian management of newly conquered territories. In about 586 BCE, the Southern Kingdom of Judah (remember, that Israel had been divided into two distinct kingdoms) was conquered by Babylon, and only the notables led off (the \"Babylonian exile\"). In neither of these cases do the Hebrew/Jews seems to be particularly singled out.\n\nLets skip to the Roman Era. Here, the Jews are unique. Roman policy granted wide religious freedom--however, there were two exceptions. 1) secret \"mystery cults\" were widely suspected, 2) groups that refused to sacrifice to the emperor (first Jews, later also Christians) were treated as suspect. The Jews led a series of wars against the Empire called the \"Jewish Wars\" that ended up with the destruction of the Temple after the First Jewish\u2013Roman War (67-70 CE) and ultimately the majority of the Jewish population of Roman Province of Judea being killed, exiled, or sold into slavery in the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132 \u2013 136 CE). These are exemplary of the unique relationship Jews have within the Roman Empire, but is likely not what you're asking about.\n\nMost of what people think of are the Medieval and Early Modern expulsions from states in Christian Europe. One thing to note is that Jews existed in these places at all. No other religion besides Christianity existed in these states at all. Judaism had a special status that, say, Roman Paganism did not, and therefore they (often) were the only religious minority allowed to exist. So, it's important to note, they were the only religious minority that could be expelled from Europe (besides various Christian \"heretics\"). It's worth noting that the vast majority of expulsions of Jews were done by Christians, with a few isolated (and generally late) cases of expulsion by Muslim rulers.\n\nKaren Barkey and Ira Katznelson have an interesting article, whose name I forgot, that argues that the expulsion of the Jews by England in 1290 and France around the same time were the result of \"state formation\"/\"state making\". Remember, for most of post-Roman history the centralized state as we imagine didn't exist. It was an overlapping series of domains where rulers claimed varying levels of sovereignty. Katznelson and Barkey argue that the Jews were expelled in England as a compromise between the royalty and the nobility in the process of state formation (primarily, the nobility owned Jewish bankers a tremendous amount of money, as Jews often formed the only source of credit). In France, they argue that they were expelled for a different reason (I believe because the King owed them money, but I can't be sure). But in both cases, though the exact reasons were different, the expulsion of the Jews was part of the same process of state formation, a result of negotiations around the clashing interests of royalty and nobility. This pattern, they argue, is repeated in other states (Western and Northern Europe is generally seen at the vanguard of modern state formation in Europe--see Charles Tilly's epic Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990-1992).\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that Jews were often the only available scapegoats. Many of the expulsions took place during plagues, especially in Germany, where Jews were often accused of poisoning wells. They were also often occurred after an accusation of blood libel. Historically, it's worth noting that blood libel accusation (which date back to at least the 12th century in Christian Europe) never occurred in the Islamic World until the 19th century, and even there, not coincidentally, the first several cases accusation were brought by Christians living under Ottoman Rule at the same there was expanding European influence in the Ottoman. But in general, the relationship with minority communities was different in the Ottoman World (much is made of \"dhimmi\" status, but there's a reason for that--especially in the Ottoman Empire, the \"millet system\" in both formal and informal forms was an important strategy for rule). In the Muslim World, Jews and Christians were often included alongside Muslims as (unequal) subjects in a way that they were not in Europe. Granted, even these limited rights were frequently violated, but this legal framework of (unequal) belonging provided the Jews (and minority Christians) with much more stability than they had in most of Europe of the same period. This situation remains essentially until <b> nationalism </b>arrives in the 19th century century.\n<b> \nNationalism</b>, the idea that the legitimacy of the state comes from its relationship with a titular<b>  \"natio</b>n\" (France is for the French, Germany for the Germans), generally dates only back to the French Revolution (this is the traditional starting date). There were of course other forms identity underlying the legitimacy of states before this--especially religion, as John Armstrong argues in Nations Befo<b> re Nationali</b>sm, but this wasn't rea<b> lly national</b>ism in the sense that we see (a political demand for a Christian state for all the Christian, etc.). A few scholars--Philip Gorski, Liah Greenfeld, Anthony Marx--have argued, convincingly I think, that we should<b>  see nationa</b>lism as an Early Modern phenomenon, rather than entirely a Modern one (remembering that \"the Modern Era\" for political history is conventionally dated to around the French Revolution). Among these, Marx argues most convincingly<b>  that nation</b>alism comes not just from union--gathering all the Rutherians into the Rutherian state--but from exclusion. He engages with three main examples (England, Spain, and France). In Spain, we see this process of expulsion--this Proto-S<b> panish natio</b>nalism--in the form of the expulsion of Muslims and Jews from Spain in 1492 (and from Portugal in 1496). This sets the ground for the later <b> Spanish</b> nation state. Similarly, in France we see expulsions, but not of Jews. Rather, we see France kill and expel Protestants to create a purely Catholic realm (cf. St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572). These sorts of expulsi<b> ons wer</b>e common during the European \"Wars of Reli<b> gion\". So na</b>tionalism, and the drive to create in theory culturally homogenous states, wasn't merely a process that affected the Jews, though it was a process that often affected the Jews. It's also worth noting that \"Jewish emancipation\"--Jew being able function as equal citizens--doesn't emerge until the French Revolution, and the question of whether Jews can really be memb<b> ers of </b>the nation-state isn't settled until the 19th and 20th centuries (cf. the Dreyfus Affair in Fra<b> nce, </b>or the Nazi stripping of the rights of German Jews). Many of the expulsions of Jews (and Catholics and Protestants, etc.) that occur during the early Modern Period, Anthony Marx argues, should be seen as examples<b>  of emerging</b> nationalism where cultural identity becomes tied to the polity (compare this to earlier empires which were inherently diverse).\n\nSo, therefore, recent social science works argues that 1) since Jews <b> were th</b>e most common religious minority in Christian Europe, they were the ones most commonly persecuted against, 2) that a lot of the Medieval st<b> ruggles arou</b>nd nationalism have to do with negotiations of elites around the beginnings of modern state formation/centralization, 3) I forgot to mention also the traditional answer of the late Medieval religious revival, including the Crusades, that ultimately led to the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation, which mattered in some places (especially when tied to Blood Libel), just not the French and English cases I mentioned, 4) eventually the goal of religious homogeneity presaged the overall goal of cultural<b>  homogeneity</b> of nationalism. Again, this is all primarily in Europe until the 19th century, though there were large populations of Jews in Anatolia, North Africa, Mesopotamia, Arabia, and Persia who were mostly unmolested. This, I think, is evidence that the repeated expulsion of the Jews is not necessarily something inherent in the Jews, but something (or several things) that characterized the relationship between Jewish minorities and Christian rulers during this period.\n\nEdit: One final note. In the video, they often repeat the names of territories in a relatively short period. The reason for this is Jews were expelled, here for either reasons related to Christian religious revival or debts due to state formation, and then were at times often quickly let back in for economic reasons (i.e. the state needed lines of credit that only the Jews could provide in this period), and then quickly expelled either for economic reasons again (rulers had quickly racked up debt) or because of a deal with religious revivalists. But the reasons they were let back in hints at one of the reasons they were expelled.",

You'll only hear those words whenever your talking and stating true facts why Jewish people are hated. I'm going to state real true facts so please don't question me after. Jewish control banks from around the world meaning they control governments and their future, they are the real reason why we wonder why there's poverty and deseases that kill people daily, they have the power and control of a grea<b> t natio</b>n which is the U.S, they make the US fight their wars they lie about the real truth making it seem like they are the victims. The holocaust happpened but not as exaggerating how they tell it. Always been prosecuted group of people but I wonder why?? They've been around longer than you think.

            "commentText": "WHOA!!!! 99% of the comments seem to be so patently and blatently anti-Jewish, or just plain false representations of the way the world works, that it's scary.  \"The Jews\" have and continue to be the scapegoats for evil people for thousands of years. because they stick together, refuse to be subjugated and have an inconquerable spirit that others envy and hate them for. Also, there are some nasty anti-Jewish things in the Bible which people have taken to heart and run with.... and the founders of Protestantism, most particularly Luther, often had a VISCIOUS anti-Jewish streak in them.  As a group, they are indeed over-represented in terms of business, science, warfare strategists, and other intellectual pursuits.    This, however, is a far cry from them trying to control world affairs for some nafarious and poorly-defined purpose!! GIVE UP THE HATRED, people..... it hurts YOU far more than it hurts the ones you hate.... and it hurts society as a whole.  Every drop of suspicion, fear and hatred, makes this world a nastier, more dangerous and harsh place to live in. Just let it go and do the best you can with your lives.",

This world was a different planet 2000 years ago and even just 55 years ago during World War II. \nNo one's religion is more true than the next one and no one human like figure is or was God. Surely anyone with intelligence has to agree on a more communal definition of God, as  a divine  and very intelligent source to be able to lead the planet's creatures through evolution over millions of years.\nThe amount of people killed in religious wars over the true  and only God and *HIS commandments* is astounding and simply does not affect the 21st century any longer. \nI believe that because of the CLAN like  brotherhood of the Jews, their desire to be educated and hold high offices with good pay to be able to rise positively and quickly to power after being dispelled from so many  cultures in the past, may be just jealousy. They figured out that family groups  and learned skills were necessary to establish themselves to their liking in a new country.To have 8 jewish lawyers, 5 <b> doctors </b>and a few bank owners in your family is definitely more advantageous in our capitalistic society, than a farmer and electrician, not to demean this valuable trait. \nDo all as well as you can and you too will hold a better self esteem, devoid of destructive emotions.",

It all comes from the fact that the traditional Jewish way has a somewhat closed and isolated societal structure to help each other and keep each other protected and stronger.. when they migrate to an area (into a country with it's own non-Jewish culture) the Jewish cloistering and self assistance within that community is seen as secretive, separate and distrusting .. that is often viewed  as a threat by the indigenous culture especially when members of the indigenous culture are struggling and they see the Jewish community doing well... remember people feel that if you're not sharing you are taking. simple as that.",

They were probably always afraid because they were a defenseless minority living on the good will and charity of others. That insured that they were very well behaved.  I believe that the primary reason why Jews were kicked out of these countries and city state from the Middle Ages up to the <b> Age </b>of Reason was due to the bigotry and intolerance of Gentile Europe. It was really, in part, the times. Even Christians (Catholics and Protestants) were very intolerant to each other after Luther broke with the Catholic Church.",

Justify your Jew hatred by blaming us for your sick need to hate. Sometimes it is actually funny listening to you Jew haters puke out your garbage. And as for Israel, it is not possible to steal something that was always ours. And Israel was ours long before  the Romans, Turks, Muslims and British stole it. It is ours again and  that won't change. So hate me to your little heart's content. I don't care. We have our country and we are ready. If I say anything more, You Tube won't print it.

Have they ever done anything wrong? Or is it just a huge, global conspiracy orchestrated by literally hundreds of billions of people through history who in many cases don't even know each other? Typically, when a group or individual is complained about and hated by literally every other group and individual that has dealt with it in any capacity, we look at the behavior of the group or individual everyone has the gripe with. If the Jew continues to behave the way it has through history, it's going to continue to face overwhelming hatred and violence toward it. If it changes it's behavior, obviously people will change their views toward the Jew.",

            "commentText": "As the world turns there's a reason why so much energy has to go into worrying about why this is even a thing. There's very cool, lovable Jews among us and that's why it's not Jew, or Christian or Muslim person that deserves hate it is the levers of control that are exploiting true believers, like mom used to say hate the sin not the person bc sinning had to be taught and it's not the poor persons fault. Religions have been trying to control people since we speared woolly mammoths in one form or another and became magnitudes more powerful due to the invention of writing, scribes and priestly class mingled together into royalty and the law became what they said going so far as to deify themselves ,sound like lil bit like anyone yet? By controlling the flow of information and veiling much of it under instuttutions who hid meaning within mysterious deceptions astrology, numerology, riddles etc kept this cabal able to exert vast influence with relatively few members in essence having others do their bidding enthusiastically. Like mom said many times -theres <b> nothing </b>new under the sun. Whether these religions are at their shenanigans under the sun or hidden in shadows it's interesting to see who is active exerting influence to what ends these days and to discern to what ends. You cannot convince me that any man will write something only for the glory of God's spirit inside of us without giving way to temptation to glorify himself with ultimate hubris, oh wait, it's been done who's God's so called chosen according to the person writing it, is it the week, the pious the righteous? This tipped me off although to be fair every tribe and extended family ,<b>  nation</b> and loose organization of similiar ppl considered themselves better than everyone else, it's practically the name of every tribe ,they say that We are the people, not you or anyone else. That's all good except that we are living in a exceedingly small world where knowledge is leveliing the mountains of ignorance so that the human family that lost iit's roots are meeting each other again and becoming aquainted and do not like being lied to, toyed with scammed, cheated or kept out of the loop in any way the men of one country feel as worthy as any other and especially when people start claiming to be part of a sacred bloodline that considers others inferior or different in some way it is either wrong and must be denied any place in modern discourse or if it's going to be used to prove a point then will be taken as what it is , a bigotted position that invites fierce competition to prove it and that's dangerous as we have seen. Religions are due for a cleanup, Christianity has tried and succeeded sometimes and missed the mark at other times , Islam and Judaism need more than ever to answer this call and especially Judaism in many ways is long overdue for a deep cleaning if it's to lead minds into the future, theres a problem when the very books that  Faith's claim to receive moral authority are smeared with lies and unable to admit where wrong and change. I mean religion has a amazing way of bringing ppl together , it needs to find out where it's going after that like maybe some worthwhile goals that help the guman condition soul equality and rights for all men, but  if it's going to keep out the other 99% of the human beings on the planetthen maybe it's prejudice<b> , racis</b>t evil or just worthless and should go the way of Gobekli Tepe and bury itself in dirt.",

            "commentText": "Probably one of the reasons of that video is to show Anti-Semitism is existent and alive. One can see that just by looking at many comments shown here.So if ever one says to himself that Anti-Semitism is a myth , same one should ask himself how come there had been Pogroms against Jews all throughout History in last 20 centuries (needless to mention Holocaust), One should ask himself how come Israel is criticized more than all other countries put together when victims in Israeli -Arab conflict are not even 1/100 of victims in conflicts of middle east from 1948 (when modern Israel was created). Some other ideas are commented here such as \"If everyone hates Jews ,something is wrong with them\" or \"if they are hated by all their neighbors it means something\" - that at least is typically an Anti-Semitic sentence usually commented by people who do not even know they are Anti-Semites. Others (mainly Jews ) say that they\u00a0live in the USA (or\u00a0Europe) and <b> nothing </b>happened to them or were never offended\u00a0, well\u00a0try wearing for one week Just a Kippa (or Yarmulke) and check that again.Anti-Semitism is not a Jewish problem but a world's\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0problem , it's about hate in general and is the basis for all other forms of hate (including color based ones) so if one finally agrees that he hates Jews should asks himself if he is a hateful person.",

                    "commentText": "RatherA   System is the problem \ud83c\udfe1 Our Life should be around these Great Qualities.....\r\n\r\n1, Show all living creatures; all the love and kindness as much as you can.\r\n\r\n2, Only try to be honest with yourself. If you try to be honest with others, you will get into big trouble soon or later.\r\n\r\n3, Aim only one target at a time; otherwise you are chasing two rabbits and you will miss both. So, the reason behind it. Have one powerful reason and never ever give up the one you want the most.\r\n\r\n4, Don't try to be good person only but be the powerful person. We will grow to be the one or we will die. There is no other choice. \r\n\r\n5, Always learn and look for to improve something your life. \r\n\r\n6, You are not alone. Love and faith the high power reduces unnecessary stress in life. But never completely rely on it. \r\n\r\n7,  Success and happiness are the byproducts of our usefulness. So, always increase the possibility of success.\r\n\r\n8, Life is not going to be easy. Because of our unnecessary things. Eliminate all the unnecessary things as much as you can by organising yourself well with the environments. \r\n\r\n9, Never believe anything without the proper evidences. \r\n\r\n10, Always try to give more than you take. \r\nBecause it is dignity/ character of the divinity within you.\n\n\r\n\ud83c\udf0e As long as people continue to see themselves as separate from everything else, they lend themselves to being completely enslaved. Success depends on how well we relate to everything around us. Joy comes from that bliss of connectedness. I believe that unarmed truth and love will have the final word in reality. To love; you should have good heart. I am a good person until I see a person better than my standard of goodness. Being good is the progress towards a worthy cause. Love is God. Whoever lives in love, lives forever. How selfish it is to try to keep something forever? Love is all about nourishing, nurturing, sharing and expanding the love within you for all. The principle to which we adhere to is that we have kindness of love at heart for the whole of mankind. \u00a0As long as there is the unnecessary differences within us; we can not live peacefully so we have to eliminate all the unnecessary differences among us so we can love all. People abilities may vary but not there true love. If we love a person/ God for a reason then we love the reason but not the person. No reason is the reason to love the person because true love never fails. So do not compare or measure the true love as first or the last but love all truly. If you love people truly then you can understand people. If you don't love then you don't understand people at all.\n\nPeople are controlled by system why?\nThe Cyclical Consumption is the current economy all over the World. It is making the scarcity problems of the earth finite resources to deteriorate day by day. Current Monetary System is legalised theft. Real money is Gold and Silver. Scarcity gives the money more value. Real money won't lose it's value. When Governments stay away from Gold & Silver then very easy to transfer the wealth / resources to upper class the Rich (Corporatocracy) Elite. When the Governments are printing out more new fiat currency with reserve banks, our <b> old </b>currency is losing its purchasing power everyday. They are printing millions of currency everyday. All governments and laws are existing right now to transfer wealth to upper class the rich elite. The USA Government & other Governments are in many countries, bailed the investment banks & financial institutions in 2008 against the majority of the people. There is no democracy in any countries. Because of the Money System based on profits motive only above all else even humans lives and well-being. So, we do not have freedom to protect our values with the money so on. The violence, bankruptcy & all the negativities are build into the Monetary System of our society. All are owned (including ourselves) by Reserve Bank. Which is private cartel the corporation. So, in legal system, we are legally considered as chattel the properties. They make money in the capital markets with our birth certificates. They do not consider us as Humans. That's the truth. We are at the invisible war with the Elites (Corporatocracies). We have to fight for our Freedom. Resource Based Economy is the Solution. We have to declare the earth resources as the heritage of all the people of this world. So everyone has access to it. Please have your research about zeitgeist movement then you know the truth more.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Truth About Health/Drugs Industry Because Of It Your Life At High Risk The drug industry is a 1/2 trillion dollars a year worldwide conglomerate. Almost 300 billions dollars just in North America. That is really big business. What would happen if everyone were well? There is no money in health. You see, good health makes a lot of sense but it doesn't make a lot of dollars. Because everything they do is toxic. Every drug they use, prescription drugs, all drugs are liver toxic, bar none. If you've had amalgam fillings put in your mouth by dentists. It is highly toxic. There's cancer because most of the chemos are themselves carcinogens. To view the tumor as the cancer and we know the tumor is not the cancer. The cancer industry is 200 billions dollars a year. The more work they get, the more profit there is. You have to dismantle; If the truth ever came out about what we would need to do. 30% of people of females in America are at risk of getting, will get cancer of the breast. The ones that are already dead have been grossly mistreated by the medical profession and by the government that supposedly is supposed to encourage free research and development of all possibilities. Why would medical<b>  doctors</b> who studied medicine and practice medicine and are heavily funded by pharmaceutical companies why would they go and look into vitamins? That they never had the answer orthomolecular. And as more and more of our population start taking their health into their own hands, there's going to be even more and more of changes. It can't go on the way it is. The system is failing apart. We must make nutrition the primary prevention strategy for the population. You are what you eat. You are everything that you have ever done to yourself. The choices you make directly affect the outcome of your life. - (Food Matters Documentary in Netflix)\n\n\ud83d\ude0a Well, I truly love God. I am not religious but very spiritual person. So, I believe 1) Religion is the beliefs in someone experiences But spirituality is having my own experiences. The mainstream religions people promote religious ideology by giving guidelines and guide but In my spiritual life; I do not want anyone or anything between God and me to restrict my freedom to worship God. 2) We do not need any authorities to do good work. The god work is the good work always. In contrast; organised mainstream religions are claiming that they have the authorities to do God works as leaders so on. 3) God is not capable of doing wrong thing, change the past for us and create anything out o<b> f nothin</b>g for u<b> s. Nothi</b>ng means not anything. So, even God is limited. The mainstream religious people believe that God is unlimited. 4) God wants us to take responsibilities for our righteousness life but not for all the consequences of our actions because they are continued to exist among us. So, How can god punish us for all our consequences? The mainstream religious people believe we are full of sins because of all our actions. 5) Freewill \u00a0is an illusion. People always choose the perceived path of greatest pleasure. \u00a0So, we do not have choices all the time. In contrast teachings of the mainstream religions are promoting people to do god's will always because we all have choices of freewill always. 6) We can not separate everything into groups. So, everything for good and evil and there's no success and failure for everything. If everything is real then real things can not be threatened. Once you come to understand that God/The Holy Spirit is in each of us, You will no longer need a Book to tell you how to live. Then why we need religious scriptures? The Virtue is the expression of the basic goodness in our actions. The Basic goodness is the fundamental worthiness of every individuals. We are worthy to God always in everything. 7) Beliefs in a cruel God makes a cruel man. No matter what; every living creatures has the right to live and What makes their life cheap? Everything depends on everythi<b> ng. Noth</b>ing too big or too small in value. We can not love and hate at the same time; Being a vegetarian means love without cruelty happily. The mainstream religious people are killing people and sacrificing animals in the name of God. They promote God's cruel punishments. The Punishment is endless for Sinners/Devil according to religious scriptures. But God is love always. Overcome hate with love. If all religions for peace, unity? No way. Because they are not for peace. 8) Well, The God gave us everything to go from moment to moment in our lives as we do our part \u00a0and pray only to thank god then the Love is in progress. The Love is always for everyone. We are always worthy of the God's love. Our greatest fear is; not to be loved by anyone but we are all loved by someone. When we eliminate all our unnecessary differences among us then true peaceful life is possible with the true love. If we can't find the peace within ourselves then we will never find it anywhere else. 9) This is the Fight for independence and freedom of humanity to worship God freely without religious guide and guidelines to restrict us. Unnecessarily, We do not want third party controls over us in anything ; especially in spirituality. 10) Revive Survive Thrive. Sincerely, \u00a0The Real Peacemaker against religious oppression.\n\n  [LINK] \n\n [LINK] ",

The bearing of false witness is their predominant trait; passed down to them throughout the ages. As their antecedents were willing to bear false witness - so they have adopted the practice. This flouting of the Ninth Commandment is what their existence is based upon.\nTheir hatred of the Jews is based on jealousy, the jealousy of success through hard work and ingenuity and a creed of helping each other, an eagerness to learn and to pass on that learning. The most famous Jew was Jesus Christ; who according to history was born with these traits. \nThe Irony of the Ante-Semites is that many of them would not exist today without the contribution that Jews have made to Medicine. If they themselves had not been saved by one of these medical breakthroughs; you can be sure that their antecedents would have been. Of course had their antecedents perished they would not exist.

            "commentText": "I am called \"anti-Semitic.\" I only have a problem with Jewish Supremacists, Semitic or not, who hate me because I'm not one of them. If you're not a Jewish Supremacist, and don't auto-hate based on skin color, I don't have a problem with you. I try to do unto others as I would have them do unto me. If I'm wrong, let me know. I do the same for you. \n\nBefore being labeled \"anti-Semitic,\" I was a total Jew sympathizer. It was \"Jews\" who changed my attitude toward them. Beginning with the <b> woman </b>down the street in the late 80's who wanted to pay me $1.00/hr when the rest of the neighbors were paying $2.00/hr. for me to babysit. I was taken aback but nonetheless still a sympathizer. You know... \"the holocaust and all.\"\n\nIt was the rabbi who taught the university course on Antisemitism in the early 2000's who rocked my world most directly and dramatically. Was I the only non-jew in the class? It was such a traumatic experience for me that I cannot remember how I even got out of it. I know I didn't complete the course. Perhaps I barely escaped their trauma-based mind control in time with a withdrawal.\n\nI have a bachelors and a masters so I must have left the class somewhat peacefully. Can you imagine 16 weeks of hearing about how wonderful the Jews are and how evil and murderous everyone else is? When you're a \"white\" person, already well indoctrinated into the whole white-guilt perspective through public schooling; eventually the camel's back breaks and all is lost. A person can only handle so much false \"guilt.\"\n\nThe evil of these Satanists is unhinging. So, no, I'm not anti-Semitic. I AM TOTALLY Anti-Satanic though. Someone who is truly of the Almighty CREATOR of All Things is not a liar, one who corrupts good for evil, a thief, a murderer, a pornographer, a pedophile, a rapist, a monopolist, or a supremacist with hatred for everyone who is not like them.",

They use America to fund their defense and con us into fighting their wars. They turn around and use our money to buy our politicians,  who in turn, put Isreali interests ahead of American interests. Is that antisemitic? I see it as criticism of a foreign state reliant on American tax dollars to survive, not hate speech.",

The more people are figuring it out even though they are pumping billions of dollars into their propaganda machine to look like the victim people are figuring it out. All Jewish people who don't agree with a lot of those teachings who generally do care about other human beings and do not consider themselves Superior all those Jewish people should absolutely deny ounce their leaders especially the religious leaders and denounce all those writings and pretend they never were Jewish because if there was ever a cursed <b> race </b>on this planet who has been doing evil longer than everybody else but blaming it on everyone else it would be them. At least the Romans were honest about their tyranny. But the Jews didn't have a hundred million people or Army so they have to do their tyranny through religion and through banks and business which has been well documented by thousands of people who have been cheated by them yet they turn around and call those people haters because they didn't like being robbed.  Eventually Islam is going to overrun them like a flood.  The Frankenstein they created is actually going to come back to bite them.",

                    "commentText": "@Joe SoapThis is a misconception amongst non Jews and ironically around Jews who don't know their religion or traditions, or heritage very well. Being chosen simply means Jews were chosen for a certain task e.g. Deuteronomy 26:18. In Jewish tradition the gentile is just as important as the Jew God has special tasks for them as well. In some cases very special tasks. Some of the greatest heroes in the Jewish Bible were gentiles not Jews.  Noah had a task of saving the world but he was not Jewish, Job was a perfect man and lived an exemplary life but he was not Jewish, Caleb helped Israel conquer the promised land but he was not Jewish these are all none Jewish heroes within the Jewish bible and Jews are taught to revere them.  Rachel from Jericho, Cyrus King of Persia who the Jewish bible calls Messiah, Ruth the Moabites who later becomes Jewish though marriage became the great,great, etc..grandmother of Jesus.  In Judaism Righteous gentiles 'have a place in the world to come' You don't have to be Jewish  or become Jewish to be righteous. In a very real way Judaism is the most tolerant of all the three monotheistic religions.\u00a0\n\nIn Christianity you cannot be righteous unless you become a Christian in Islam its the same.\n\nMaimonides the Jewish sage in  Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Teshuvah 3:4 based on Tosefta Sanhedrin 13:1; Talmud Sanhedrin 105a states \n\"Righteous gentiles have a place in the world to come.\"",

The Catholic Church did the same thing during The Inquisition and The Spanish Inquisition; where Christianity was used as a weapon to not allow converso Jews to practice their ancestral religion not even in private. The Church tortured and killed thousands of Jews in the process, enriching themselves by confiscating properties of Jews illegally  and all but whipped out their identity with fear, terror and torture.

                    "commentText": "\u200b@Joe Soap There are anomalies and paradoxes and obscure passages in every religion... For example why do Christians insist that Jesus is God when the Jewish scriptures tell us  'God is Not a man Nor the Son of Man' Numbers 23:19, or  Why did Jesus call the Caananite <b> woman </b>and her people dogs Matthew 16:26....\u00a0 Lastly and Most importantly  don't confuse local factional religious interpretations, customs, and  practices,  and traditions (which are non-binding by  Jewish law) with what is considered Halakhah (Jewish law) which is binding.\u00a0\n\nI will go the extra mile for you and explain in a little more detail in what that last sentence means. Circumcision on a  male child on the 8th day is Halachically binding it is Jewish law called Halakhah but thanking God for not making you a<b>  woman</b>, gentile, or anything else for that matter is not, its actually called 'aggada' (non-binding) an optional local and sometimes sectarian tradition or interpretation  and in reality  most of the time shunned in  prayer in most synagogue liturgy within the broad spectrum of Judaism.\n\n       I hope that answers your questions and if I could offer you one last piece of practical advice  that might help you along this journey that we call life its not wise to paint with large strokes, lines get blurred and many of the important distinguishing details get lost in the process.\n\n\"In line with the accepted tendency to define aggadah as \"that which is not halakhah,\" one could say that the relation between aggadah and halakhah is similar to the relation between theory and practice, between idea and application, and, in the area of ethics, between character and behavior.\" Jewish virtual library",

However Republican administrations have been more favorable to Israel than Democrats. Obama pretty much fucked Israel. So if the Jews own all this power wouldn't they more than likely use thier control of media and Hollywood to push for a conservative government that would be more favorable to the Jewish state. Does anyone else see the flaw here.",

Just thought I'd try to follow the line of logic, and see if it passed the test. As a free thinking person, I'd say that so far it does; but that at this stage it is only a theory, and not yet proven. Caution must be taken, more information is needed. Truth is more easily found by those willing to love and forgive, since those who do wrong tend to hide for fear of judgement and never do better.",

If you try to be honest with others, you will get into big trouble soon or later.\r\n\r\n3, Aim only one target at a time; otherwise you are chasing two rabbits and you will miss both. So, the reason behind it. Have one powerful reason and never ever give up the one you want the most.\r\n\r\n4, Don't try to be good person only but be the powerful person. We will grow to be the one or we will die. There is no other choice. \r\n\r\n5, Always learn and look for to improve something your life. \r\n\r\n6, You are not alone. Love and faith the high power reduces unnecessary stress in life. But never completely rely on it. \r\n\r\n7,  Success and happiness are the byproducts of our usefulness. So, always increase the possibility of success.\r\n\r\n8, Life is not going to be easy. Because of our unnecessary things. Eliminate all the unnecessary things as much as you can by organising yourself well with the environments. \r\n\r\n9, Never believe anything without the proper evidences. \r\n\r\n10, Always try to give more than you take. \r\nBecause it is dignity/ character of the divinity within you.\n\n\r\n\ud83c\udf0e As long as people continue to see themselves as separate from everything else, they lend themselves to being completely enslaved. Success depends on how well we relate to everything around us. Joy comes from that bliss of connectedness. I believe that unarmed truth and love will have the final word in reality. To love; you should have good heart. I am a good person until I see a person better than my standard of goodness. Being good is the progress towards a worthy cause. Love is God. Whoever lives in love, lives forever. How selfish it is to try to keep something forever? Love is all about nourishing, nurturing, sharing and expanding the love within you for all. The principle to which we adhere to is that we have kindness of love at heart for the whole of mankind. \u00a0As long as there is the unnecessary differences within us; we can not live peacefully so we have to eliminate all the unnecessary differences among us so we can love all. People abilities may vary but not there true love. If we love a person/ God for a reason then we love the reason but not the person. No reason is the reason to love the person because true love never fails. So do not compare or measure the true love as first or the last but love all truly. If you love people truly then you can understand people. If you don't love then you don't understand people at all.\n\nPeople are controlled by system why?\nThe Cyclical Consumption is the current economy all over the World. It is making the scarcity problems of the earth finite resources to deteriorate day by day. Current Monetary System is legalised theft. Real money is Gold and Silver. Scarcity gives the money more value. Real money won't lose it's value. When Governments stay away from Gold & Silver then very easy to transfer the wealth / resources to upper class the Rich (Corporatocracy) Elite. When the Governments are printing out more new fiat currency with reserve banks, our <b> old </b>currency is losing its purchasing power everyday. They are printing millions of currency everyday. All governments and laws are existing right now to transfer wealth to upper class the rich elite. The USA Government & other Governments are in many countries, bailed the investment banks & financial institutions in 2008 against the majority of the people. There is no democracy in any countries. Because of the Money System based on profits motive only above all else even humans lives and well-being. So, we do not have freedom to protect our values with the money so on. The violence, bankruptcy & all the negativities are build into the Monetary System of our society. All are owned (including ourselves) by Reserve Bank. Which is private cartel the corporation. So, in legal system, we are legally considered as chattel the properties. They make money in the capital markets with our birth certificates. They do not consider us as Humans. That's the truth. We are at the invisible war with the Elites (Corporatocracies). We have to fight for our Freedom. Resource Based Economy is the Solution. We have to declare the earth resources as the heritage of all the people of this world. So everyone has access to it. Please have your research about zeitgeist movement then you know the truth more.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Truth About Health/Drugs Industry Because Of It Your Life At High Risk The drug industry is a 1/2 trillion dollars a year worldwide conglomerate. Almost 300 billions dollars just in North America. That is really big business. What would happen if everyone were well? There is no money in health. You see, good health makes a lot of sense but it doesn't make a lot of dollars. Because everything they do is toxic. Every drug they use, prescription drugs, all drugs are liver toxic, bar none. If you've had amalgam fillings put in your mouth by dentists. It is highly toxic. There's cancer because most of the chemos are themselves carcinogens. To view the tumor as the cancer and we know the tumor is not the cancer. The cancer industry is 200 billions dollars a year. The more work they get, the more profit there is. You have to dismantle; If the truth ever came out about what we would need to do. 30% of people of females in America are at risk of getting, will get cancer of the breast. The ones that are already dead have been grossly mistreated by the medical profession and by the government that supposedly is supposed to encourage free research and development of all possibilities. Why would medical<b>  doctors</b> who studied medicine and practice medicine and are heavily funded by pharmaceutical companies why would they go and look into vitamins? That they never had the answer orthomolecular. And as more and more of our population start taking their health into their own hands, there's going to be even more and more of changes. It can't go on the way it is. The system is failing apart. We must make nutrition the primary prevention strategy for the population. You are what you eat. You are everything that you have ever done to yourself. The choices you make directly affect the outcome of your life. - (Food Matters Documentary in Netflix)\n\n\ud83d\ude0a Well, I truly love God. I am not religious but very spiritual person. So, I believe 1) Religion is the beliefs in someone experiences But spirituality is having my own experiences. The mainstream religions people promote religious ideology by giving guidelines and guide but In my spiritual life; I do not want anyone or anything between God and me to restrict my freedom to worship God. 2) We do not need any authorities to do good work. The god work is the good work always. In contrast; organised mainstream religions are claiming that they have the authorities to do God works as leaders so on. 3) God is not capable of doing wrong thing, change the past for us and create anything out o<b> f nothin</b>g for u<b> s. Nothi</b>ng means not anything. So, even God is limited. The mainstream religious people believe that God is unlimited. 4) God wants us to take responsibilities for our righteousness life but not for all the consequences of our actions because they are continued to exist among us. So, How can god punish us for all our consequences? The mainstream religious people believe we are full of sins because of all our actions. 5) Freewill \u00a0is an illusion. People always choose the perceived path of greatest pleasure. \u00a0So, we do not have choices all the time. In contrast teachings of the mainstream religions are promoting people to do god's will always because we all have choices of freewill always. 6) We can not separate everything into groups. So, everything for good and evil and there's no success and failure for everything. If everything is real then real things can not be threatened. Once you come to understand that God/The Holy Spirit is in each of us, You will no longer need a Book to tell you how to live. Then why we need religious scriptures? The Virtue is the expression of the basic goodness in our actions. The Basic goodness is the fundamental worthiness of every individuals. We are worthy to God always in everything. 7) Beliefs in a cruel God makes a cruel man. No matter what; every living creatures has the right to live and What makes their life cheap? Everything depends on everythi<b> ng. Noth</b>ing too big or too small in value. We can not love and hate at the same time; Being a vegetarian means love without cruelty happily. The mainstream religious people are killing people and sacrificing animals in the name of God. They promote God's cruel punishments. The Punishment is endless for Sinners/Devil according to religious scriptures. But God is love always. Overcome hate with love. If all religions for peace, unity? No way. Because they are not for peace. 8) Well, The God gave us everything to go from moment to moment in our lives as we do our part \u00a0and pray only to thank god then the Love is in progress. The Love is always for everyone. We are always worthy of the God's love. Our greatest fear is; not to be loved by anyone but we are all loved by someone. When we eliminate all our unnecessary differences among us then true peaceful life is possible with the true love. If we can't find the peace within ourselves then we will never find it anywhere else. 9) This is the Fight for independence and freedom of humanity to worship God freely without religious guide and guidelines to restrict us. Unnecessarily, We do not want third party controls over us in anything ; especially in spirituality. 10) Revive Survive Thrive. Sincerely, \u00a0The Real Peacemaker against religious oppression.\n\n  [LINK] \n\n [LINK] ",

This kind of back stabbing has gone on for more than a thousand years. Christians were forbidden to loan money at interest. So Jews were always the usury loan sharks. If a farmer needed a loan to buy seed for his farm the Jews would loan it to them at 30% interest. Then, if anything went wrong, the Christians would end up being the debt slave of the Jews. Jewish bankers financed both Hitler and Churchill because they wanted a war. Jewish bankers financed the Russian Bolsheviks who destroyed the <b> nation.</b> Jews were the owners of the slave ships that brought slaves from Africa to North America.

Sadly, the vast majority - about 80% - align themselves w/Collectivism, which is an ideology based on fomenting ENVY & engaging in THEFT, thus, the vast majority of Jews align w/a PURELY EVIL Ideology and I've never been able to figure out why???\nEspecially since that very same ideology HATES Jews w/a passion (see 1930s & 40s Germany) and if they gain the kind of power they achieved in the '30s & '40s - Jews will again be \"put to the sword...\"",

The time is drawing near when any expression of opposition to Leftist agendas will be defined as hate speech, and that will justify denying them Internet access to express their opinions.\"   -G. Edward Griffin\n\nPastor Baldwin had the courage to call the ADL bigots in MAINSTREAM?

You have to make sure that you're getting your information from places that aren't trying to tell a story.\n\nFor instance, are the facts you have merely numbers? Historically written with primary source certification? Do they have an unbiased approach, with <b> nothing </b>to tell other than numbers or history or the like?\n\nOr are your facts written next to a headline? A subtitle? Some text that clearly indicates the end goal? Are the headlines often specifically against a certain group, regardless of if the author or speaker themselves is in said group?\n\nSo, the first two sources I've seen are two youtube videos (with varying reliability considering one of the videos has likes and comments<b>  disabled</b>, which silences dissenting opinions, and that same video has <b> a woma</b>n who acts like a spokesperson for her entire community )\n\nThe second video over emphasizes mere aesthetic differences (as if a majority of jews are 100% pure blood or something), and still cites no evidence in the description or comments.\n\nThe alternet article is a whole other story. I understand very little of overseas politics so I'll leave that be for the moment and analyze the websites as valuable information sources. The website definitely has a story to sell, and a LOT of \"he said - she said\" going on, with a few sources scattered between. I'd be ok with it as a source, but approach with caution of the news site's need to tell a tale conflicting with it's necessity to tell facts as well.\n\nSimce youtube videos are considered valid in this discussion:  [LINK] \n\nThe video explains that while main reasons were originally for stopping the spread of communism a <b> la <b> R</b</b>>ed Scare style, Isreal is now creating a metaphorical wall and quarantining the Middle East thanks to Muslim extremism like ISIS.\n\nBut, it still stands that lobbying is very much an issue, and one of the main reasons I dislike capitalism as it's being applied today.\n\nEven so, Isrealites should not be treated like garbage because of their views, much like how Palestinians shouldn't be treated like garbage because of their views.\n\nDisagreements should only go so far. Disliking someone because you disagree is too far, in my opinion.\n\nAny further thoughts or opinions?",

Sarajli\u0107   System is the problem \ud83c\udfe1 Our Life should be around these Great Qualities.....\r\n\r\n1, Show all living creatures; all the love and kindness as much as you can.\r\n\r\n2, Only try to be honest with yourself. If you try to be honest with others, you will get into big trouble soon or later.\r\n\r\n3, Aim only one target at a time; otherwise you are chasing two rabbits and you will miss both. So, the reason behind it. Have one powerful reason and never ever give up the one you want the most.\r\n\r\n4, Don't try to be good person only but be the powerful person. We will grow to be the one or we will die. There is no other choice. \r\n\r\n5, Always learn and look for to improve something your life. \r\n\r\n6, You are not alone. Love and faith the high power reduces unnecessary stress in life. But never completely rely on it. \r\n\r\n7,  Success and happiness are the byproducts of our usefulness. So, always increase the possibility of success.\r\n\r\n8, Life is not going to be easy. Because of our unnecessary things. Eliminate all the unnecessary things as much as you can by organising yourself well with the environments. \r\n\r\n9, Never believe anything without the proper evidences. \r\n\r\n10, Always try to give more than you take. \r\nBecause it is dignity/ character of the divinity within you.\n\n\r\n\ud83c\udf0e As long as people continue to see themselves as separate from everything else, they lend themselves to being completely enslaved. Success depends on how well we relate to everything around us. Joy comes from that bliss of connectedness. I believe that unarmed truth and love will have the final word in reality. To love; you should have good heart. I am a good person until I see a person better than my standard of goodness. Being good is the progress towards a worthy cause. Love is God. Whoever lives in love, lives forever. How selfish it is to try to keep something forever? Love is all about nourishing, nurturing, sharing and expanding the love within you for all. The principle to which we adhere to is that we have kindness of love at heart for the whole of mankind. \u00a0As long as there is the unnecessary differences within us; we can not live peacefully so we have to eliminate all the unnecessary differences among us so we can love all. People abilities may vary but not there true love. If we love a person/ God for a reason then we love the reason but not the person. No reason is the reason to love the person because true love never fails. So do not compare or measure the true love as first or the last but love all truly. If you love people truly then you can understand people. If you don't love then you don't understand people at all.\n\nPeople are controlled by system why?\nThe Cyclical Consumption is the current economy all over the World. It is making the scarcity problems of the earth finite resources to deteriorate day by day. Current Monetary System is legalised theft. Real money is Gold and Silver. Scarcity gives the money more value. Real money won't lose it's value. When Governments stay away from Gold & Silver then very easy to transfer the wealth / resources to upper class the Rich (Corporatocracy) Elite. When the Governments are printing out more new fiat currency with reserve banks, our <b> old </b>currency is losing its purchasing power everyday. They are printing millions of currency everyday. All governments and laws are existing right now to transfer wealth to upper class the rich elite. The USA Government & other Governments are in many countries, bailed the investment banks & financial institutions in 2008 against the majority of the people. There is no democracy in any countries. Because of the Money System based on profits motive only above all else even humans lives and well-being. So, we do not have freedom to protect our values with the money so on. The violence, bankruptcy & all the negativities are build into the Monetary System of our society. All are owned (including ourselves) by Reserve Bank. Which is private cartel the corporation. So, in legal system, we are legally considered as chattel the properties. They make money in the capital markets with our birth certificates. They do not consider us as Humans. That's the truth. We are at the invisible war with the Elites (Corporatocracies). We have to fight for our Freedom. Resource Based Economy is the Solution. We have to declare the earth resources as the heritage of all the people of this world. So everyone has access to it. Please have your research about zeitgeist movement then you know the truth more.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Truth About Health/Drugs Industry Because Of It Your Life At High Risk The drug industry is a 1/2 trillion dollars a year worldwide conglomerate. Almost 300 billions dollars just in North America. That is really big business. What would happen if everyone were well? There is no money in health. You see, good health makes a lot of sense but it doesn't make a lot of dollars. Because everything they do is toxic. Every drug they use, prescription drugs, all drugs are liver toxic, bar none. If you've had amalgam fillings put in your mouth by dentists. It is highly toxic. There's cancer because most of the chemos are themselves carcinogens. To view the tumor as the cancer and we know the tumor is not the cancer. The cancer industry is 200 billions dollars a year. The more work they get, the more profit there is. You have to dismantle; If the truth ever came out about what we would need to do. 30% of people of females in America are at risk of getting, will get cancer of the breast. The ones that are already dead have been grossly mistreated by the medical profession and by the government that supposedly is supposed to encourage free research and development of all possibilities. Why would medical<b>  doctors</b> who studied medicine and practice medicine and are heavily funded by pharmaceutical companies why would they go and look into vitamins? That they never had the answer orthomolecular. And as more and more of our population start taking their health into their own hands, there's going to be even more and more of changes. It can't go on the way it is. The system is failing apart. We must make nutrition the primary prevention strategy for the population. You are what you eat. You are everything that you have ever done to yourself. The choices you make directly affect the outcome of your life. - (Food Matters Documentary in Netflix)\n\n\ud83d\ude0a Well, I truly love God. I am not religious but very spiritual person. So, I believe 1) Religion is the beliefs in someone experiences But spirituality is having my own experiences. The mainstream religions people promote religious ideology by giving guidelines and guide but In my spiritual life; I do not want anyone or anything between God and me to restrict my freedom to worship God. 2) We do not need any authorities to do good work. The god work is the good work always. In contrast; organised mainstream religions are claiming that they have the authorities to do God works as leaders so on. 3) God is not capable of doing wrong thing, change the past for us and create anything out o<b> f nothin</b>g for u<b> s. Nothi</b>ng means not anything. So, even God is limited. The mainstream religious people believe that God is unlimited. 4) God wants us to take responsibilities for our righteousness life but not for all the consequences of our actions because they are continued to exist among us. So, How can god punish us for all our consequences? The mainstream religious people believe we are full of sins because of all our actions. 5) Freewill \u00a0is an illusion. People always choose the perceived path of greatest pleasure. \u00a0So, we do not have choices all the time. In contrast teachings of the mainstream religions are promoting people to do god's will always because we all have choices of freewill always. 6) We can not separate everything into groups. So, everything for good and evil and there's no success and failure for everything. If everything is real then real things can not be threatened. Once you come to understand that God/The Holy Spirit is in each of us, You will no longer need a Book to tell you how to live. Then why we need religious scriptures? The Virtue is the expression of the basic goodness in our actions. The Basic goodness is the fundamental worthiness of every individuals. We are worthy to God always in everything. 7) Beliefs in a cruel God makes a cruel man. No matter what; every living creatures has the right to live and What makes their life cheap? Everything depends on everythi<b> ng. Noth</b>ing too big or too small in value. We can not love and hate at the same time; Being a vegetarian means love without cruelty happily. The mainstream religious people are killing people and sacrificing animals in the name of God. They promote God's cruel punishments. The Punishment is endless for Sinners/Devil according to religious scriptures. But God is love always. Overcome hate with love. If all religions for peace, unity? No way. Because they are not for peace. 8) Well, The God gave us everything to go from moment to moment in our lives as we do our part \u00a0and pray only to thank god then the Love is in progress. The Love is always for everyone. We are always worthy of the God's love. Our greatest fear is; not to be loved by anyone but we are all loved by someone. When we eliminate all our unnecessary differences among us then true peaceful life is possible with the true love. If we can't find the peace within ourselves then we will never find it anywhere else. 9) This is the Fight for independence and freedom of humanity to worship God freely without religious guide and guidelines to restrict us. Unnecessarily, We do not want third party controls over us in anything ; especially in spirituality. 10) Revive Survive Thrive. Sincerely, \u00a0The Real Peacemaker against religious oppression.\n\n  [LINK] \n\n [LINK] ",

So are you saying you wouldn't be friend with a Jew even if they were clueless about this whole Israel thing. I hate it when people like you say that all Jews are bad. How can their whole <b> race </b>be bad? I'm not saying they're all good but their whole<b>  race</b> is not terrible. I live in a community full of them and I have friends like them. Is it wrong to be friends with a Jew because you think they're all evil. I bet you some Jews don't even practice religion or don't even know about the whole situation in Israel. Just think about it will you?",

Why would you say something like that? Why do you people always judge a <b> race </b>based on your experience. I just told you that I live in a community with a few Jews and I've been friends with them. They've never done anything wrong. So stop judging a book by its cover. It just saddens me why you would believe that. That's ridiculous. You've probably only met one and now you think you're whole community is full of crooks. You need to start having a positive attitude and stop being such a hate monger because that will get you nowhere. All this<b>  racism</b> will help no one.",

There are some who refer to being anti-semitic as a form of stupidity or a social abomination, much like any other form of nonsensical hatred, but I wouldn't go that far. It comes from a lack of education, a lack of proper knowledge and world experience. It is not a coincidence that majority of the people who do hold anti-semitic views have never met a Jew, which isn't that surprising since there are so few Jews in the world. \nEducation is the only way to combat, not just anti-semitism but all sorts of extreme biased hatred. Unfortunately it is a very long process of enlightenment that will take many generations to implement and there is not enough will to introduce any such measures. It is far easier to remain ignorant and full of hate than to educate oneself or allow oneself to be educated and grasp a better understanding of the world and all its inhabitants",

So it is curious why the overwhelming majority of Jews, the world over, vote Far Left. In USA Jews vote about 80% for Far Left candidates. Indeed, with the exception of Blacks, Jews were the most reliable Obama voters and Obama was probably the most Far Left AND most anti-Semitic candidate. So when it comes to politics, Jews show an incredible self-Hatred/self-loathing/Self-destructiveness in who they vote for because the Far Left, deep down, is virulently anti-Semitic!",

Firstly, there are way too many Jewish men that hold office in the US, too many,  same as in Germany.  <b> Abe </b>Foxman head of the ADL stated that they have 20 offices in the south combating anti semitism.  No they are not they are there to create racial tension not eradicate antisemitism.  Antisemitism is everywhere and in most people.  Your backwards country Israel has done more damage to the Jews than anyone else could do.  Killing innocent Palestinians.  Taking up more land that what was given to them.  They sent those migrants to Europe, the worst of the worst I might add.\nBARBARA LERNER SPECTRE   WE WILL FLOOD EUROPE WITH MIGRANTS\nThis was their way to get more Jews to move to Israel because their aging population is dying off.'\nAgain so sick and tired of these Holocaust survivors popping up.

Here is some quick information on them: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Israel> If you don't like Wikipedia, just use a different website. They will say the same thing. One out of four Israelis are not Jewish. That's much more diverse than any other country in the Middle east. In fact, if you recorded the diversity of each country other than Israel in the Middle East and combine their degree of diversity, it wouldn't come close to that of Israel.",
