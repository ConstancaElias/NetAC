        "postText": "Harsh new laws have come into force in Brunei punishing gay sex and adultery by stoning people to death.', 'The laws, which prompted outcry when they were announced, were implemented today.', 'Under the new laws \u2013 which apply to children and foreigners, even if they are not Muslim \u2013 those found guilty of gay sex could be stoned to death or whipped.', 'Adulterers risk death by stoning too, while thieves face amputation of a right hand on their first offense and a left foot on their second.', 'The penalties were introduced under new sections of Brunei\u2019s Shariah Penal Code.', 'Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah instituted the code in 2014 to bolster the influence of Islam in the oil-rich monarchy of around 430,000 people, two-thirds of whom are Muslim.', 'Even before 2014, homosexuality was already punishable in Brunei by a jail term of up to 10 years.', 'The first stage of the Shariah Penal Code included fines or jail for offenses such as pregnancy out of wedlock or failing to pray on Fridays.', '\u2018Living in Brunei, we already knew that our sexual identity is taboo and should not be expressed. We already felt belittled before the law came to place,\u2019 said a 23-year-old member of the LGBTQ community who wanted to be identified only as Kun out of fear of reprisal from the authorities.', '\u2018Now with it, we feel even smaller and the ones who could potentially oppress us have more opportunity to harass us to say and do what they want,\u2019 he said.', 'Celebrities including George Clooney, Elton John and Ellen DeGeneres have voiced opposition to the new laws, and have rallied a boycott of nine hotels in the US and Europe with ties to Hassanal, who is still sultan.', '\u2018Are we really going to help fund the murder of innocent citizens?\u2019 Clooney wrote Thursday on Deadline Hollywood.', 'Clooney said that while you can\u2019t shame \u2018murderous regimes,\u2019 you can shame \u2018the banks, the financiers and the institutions that do business with them.\u2019', 'There has been no vocal opposition to the new penalties in Brunei, where the sultan rules as head of state with full executive authority. Public criticism of his policies is extremely rare in the country.', 'Hassanal, who has reigned since 1967, has previously said the Penal Code should be regarded as a form of \u2018special guidance\u2019 from God and would be \u2018part of the great history\u2019 of Brunei.', 'The United Kingdom, United States, Germany and France have all urged Brunei to halt its plans.', 'Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, called on the sultan to \u2018immediately suspend amputations, stoning, and all other rights-abusing provisions and punishments.\u2019', '\u2018Brunei\u2019s new penal code is barbaric to the core, imposing archaic punishments for acts that shouldn\u2019t even be crimes,\u2019 Robertson said in a statement on Wednesday.",
