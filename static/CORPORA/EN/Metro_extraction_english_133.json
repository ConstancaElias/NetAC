        "postText": "A patient who demanded to be seen by a \u2018white doctor\u2019 has been branded \u2018appalling\u2019.', 'Hospital boss Andrew Foster, and CEO of Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust, described the incident as \u2018deeply upsetting\u2019 for all of the staff.', 'Sharing the details on Twitter, he said: \u2018Would you believe a patient coming to A&E and asking to see a white doctor?', '\u2018When politely told that a white doctor was not available, the patient walked out and has formally complained about this. This was hugely upsetting for the staff involved. Appalling.\u2019', 'Speaking to Manchester Evening News, Mr Foster said that it wasn\u2019t \u2018unusual\u2019 to report something like that: \u2018Sadly we\u2019ve spoken to consultants in A&E and they agree. It happens from time to time, usually when somebody has been drinking too much.', '\u2018What is most unusual in this case, is that the patient has issued a complaint against us. That, to my knowledge, is unique.\u2019', 'It is understood that the patient was in the A&E department, when a young doctor went to do an initial assessment.', 'The patient told the doctor at the outset that he did not want to see him, but wanted to \u2018see a white doctor\u2019.', 'The medical professional left the cubicle and contacted his consultant who was also non-white.', 'Mr Foster said: \u2018The consultant calmly explained that that isn\u2019t the way it works \u2013 you have to see the next available doctor. The patients said \u2018well I\u2019m off\u2019, and then left. There was no violence or shouting, it was a simple request.\u2019', 'It\u2019s said that the junior doctor had not received such overt racism before, and was left \u2018very, very upset\u2019 following the altercation.', 'The patient has not been publicly identified, but Mr Foster confirmed that they had been banned from Wigan Infirmary, and it had been passed on to Greater Manchester Police.",

I fail to see why it would need to be reported to the police on that merit alone, regardless of a formal complaint being made. It seems strange we would treat a person as a criminal for asking a question as deluded as that question might be, if he doesn't want to be treated then he is the one missing out on what otherwise would be a professional and competent service provided by the NHS. It's his own loss.A person is entitled to be<b>  racist</b> and hold views contrary to what the rest of us think, so long as they don't behave in a way which is either violent or abusive to another. I don't see why there would be any need to publicly shame anyone either, akin to a point of organised outrage based on presumptions as bad as the racists own views, such a person would make a rod their own back and be quite plainly exposed by their daily activities without the metaphorical tar and feathering.If people are to change their views it needs to be done in ways which doesn't entrench them deeper in hatred.. especially when they ask a question.Whatever complaint the person made however needs to be met appropriately regardless of the bigot making it. We don't or shouldn't have tiers of justice depending on attitude. But certainly, throw out that which is vexatious.",
