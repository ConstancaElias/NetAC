Many of my cousins, family, and elders suffer from drug abuse and alcoholism; it's quite easy to point the finger at us, but please understand the gray area to why many of us suffer from this. Many of my elders were ripped away from their mothers and fathers, beaten to not speak their language and forced to believe in a religion not accustomed to our own faith. The PTSD they suffer, just like any man, makes them irrational and immoral. So please, recognize the gray area.\n\nN\u00fck N\u00fcw\u00fc, tantuvaitsin.",
