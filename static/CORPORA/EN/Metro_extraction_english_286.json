        "postText": "An American man convicted of murder has been given the death sentence after the jury decided he would enjoy prison because he is gay.', 'Charles Rhines was convicted in the stabbing death of a doughnut shop worker.', 'Three jurors have since come forward to admit there was a lot of prejudice on the panel with one saying: \u2018If he\u2019s gay, we\u2019d be sending him where he wants to go.\u2019', 'Yesterday the Supreme Court rejected an appeal against the death penalty meaning Rhines still faces execution.', 'The decision was greeted with horror by LGBT+ campaigners.', 'Lawyer Ria Tobacco Mar said: \u2018The court\u2019s silence sent a deeply troubling message about the value placed on the lives of LGBT people.\u2019', 'Rhines bound and stabbed Donnivan Schaeffer while robbing the doughnut shop in South Dakota in 1992.', 'The following year, he was convicted of murder and the court heard the jury were fully aware he was gay.', 'During remarks that were made public during the recent appeal, his sexuality was frequently discussed during the deliberations.', 'The Supreme Court paper notes: \u2018During penalty phase deliberations, the jurors sent out a note asking whether he would be allowed to \u2018mix with the general inmate population,\u2019 \u2018create a group of followers or admirers,\u2019 \u2018brag about his crime to other inmates, especially new and[/]or young men . . . ,\u2019 \u2018marry or have conjugal visits,\u2019 or \u2018have a cellmate.\u2019', 'It added: \u2018One juror stated that jurors \u2018knew that [Mr. Rhines] was a homosexual and thought that he shouldn\u2019t be able to spend his life with men in prison.\u2019', '\u2018A second recalled hearing an unidentified juror comment of Mr. Rhines \u2018that if he\u2019s gay we\u2019d be sending him where he wants to go if we voted for [life imprisonment without the possibility of parole].\u2019', '\u2018A third confirmed that \u2018there was lots of discussion of homosexuality. There was a lot of disgust. This is a farming community.\u2019', 'Rhines appealed against his sentence, citing a ruling last year that said evidence of racial bias in the jury room allows a judge to consider setting aside a verdict.', 'However, the Supreme Court has ruled that it will not stop the execution despite concerns about the role his sexuality played in the sentence.', 'It did not give a reason why it had rejected Rhines\u2019 appeal.', 'Ms Tobacco Mar wrote in the New York Times: \u2018Some members of the jury thought life in prison without parole would be fun for Mr Rhines.', '\u2018So they decided to sentence him to death.\u2019', 'Tabacco Mar went on to compare the sentence to another case where the jury was racially biased in their decision.', '\u2018The same rule should apply when anti-LGBT prejudice taints jurors decision-making,\u2019 she added.', '\u2018To be sure, the history of racism in America is unique and demands unique safeguards. But that does not make anti-LGBT discrimination any less objectionable, particularly when it may have made the difference between life and death.', '\u201c[The court] should take the next opportunity to correct this mistake and recognise that prejudice against people who are LGBT should play no role in America\u2019s criminal justice system.', '\u2018However, that will probably come too late for Mr Rhines.\u2019",

It could be a child ,an adult he didn't care.Are we meant to just allow him to do with  a mere prison sentence..He acts worse than most animals  but you don't agree with the death penalty!
