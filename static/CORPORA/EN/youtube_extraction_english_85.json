It requires you to please other people, particularly men, and to put your body on display. These girls are working six hours a night weekly. I get paid more than they do and I am way younger than them, plus I work four hours each day, its so sad. Stripping can have such a phycological impact on the dancers, they need more support, especially if there is a lack of acceptance within their families. These girls need to be more looked after, its as simple as that",

You are taking their hard earned money and putting it into your pocket like the snake you are. \n\nI say pay a stage fee that provides basic shit and let the girls work and keep their earnings. If you need a baby sitter (house mom) as an adult you dont deserve to be a dancer! This industry completely exploits dancers. For example when the season is good at the club most of the time the stage fee goes up and rarely does it go down even when the season slows down. Its insane!",

I don't like the stigma that is attached to strippers either, like yes some girls who strip are just naturally gross that do it for<b>  sex</b> and drugs, but then you have girls like these girls at Diamond Dolls who are literally good girls that don't do drugs or prostitute themselves and shit, they just do it as a job and go home and even though I would never be able to do that kind of job and it's not for everyone, I respect these kind of girls who are decent, good and hard working  women that just see it as a job and that's it!

Prize for pathetic goes to Colin, using his cancer as an excuse to go to strip clubs and cover up he is really just a pervert.  Many times people have negative judgemental stereotypes about strippers I think short films was good in showing strippers are often lovely girls and human beings and do not have these glamourous luxurious lifestypes that people think. I wish them all a better and happier life.",

It helps them be numb. And what about prostitution, aka having \"dates\" with customers? That is where the real money is made and where the danger becomes very real for the women. And the Boss Lady does not disclose these parts of the danger and the ugly underbelly of stripping. She probably lies to herself about these things too to convince herself she is doing something \"good\". AND the wages are the worst I have ever heard of.

Oh well i Wish she could make so much money and even have an extra job which she could do other than Stripping. I honestly wont mind Strippers as long as no one touches them for me is that Okay to be a strippers but Only if they dont get touched  or  Leave with other guys. Just strip and go home that would be okay. Yeah Kim is gorgeous. I like her. Im from Canada.",

He has gone the opposite route  to satisfying his manly fantasy before he dies or if he dies from cancer.  Life passes by so quickly,  you can never regain time lost with anyone....particularly for selfish reasons or \u2018 glut' such as this Colin.\nNot a great legacy to leave your children...

I dated a stripper in my younger days, man; and her story were a lot like a lot of these girls, I mean she were an ex-college basketball player but were super beautiful and had a degree in teaching and what; but could not save enough money teaching and what. So she took to stripping for awhile and were as what able to buy her own her house and what have a nice nest egg for herself, and had enough to also buy a nice there car, in like a few years. It paid off for her. She were pulling down on average probably 400 a night; and this as was like 20 years ago or so, some nights making up to almost a thousand. It were like <b> crazy </b>money; and this was oh her as being someone that were not a total slut about it. What you got in Scotland or the UK is totally like oh slavery man. Girls in the USA would never let that be. It has been probably twenty years since I were last in a strip club and what. \nSo I agree; freaking robbery what UK girls get paid. They obviously have not known any better money than that. In the USA you are making a 100 pounds worth of cash in the first 2 hours on a decent night in an decent enough busy area.  And you can barter your own hourly individual rate. So if you think that you are worth oh 20 pounds a dance then there is your price. The owner establishes<b>  nothing</b> of what how much girls get to charge. The girls just as lease the club space and use it like their own independent work space, with of course following certain law guidelines and what. \nThe USA is so much better if you especially are <b> a woma</b>n willing and beautiful enough, for the stripping biz. In the USA as I mean a girl easily could make it her actual lucrative career for as long as she keeps herself fit basically, as older.",

                    "commentText": "@Lara Lexus New Zealand probably has a much smaller population and more resources per person. In the UK it's pretty bleak for many people. Scotland probably has one of the highest proportion of people in poverty, so I imagine the women could be undercut by more desperate women if they started raising their prices. Also, the men don't have the free capital to be spending it in strip clubs. Those at the apex of the socio-economic pyramid probably have second homes in London, or even in the US or Singapore... So the strip clubs in places like Scotland are most likely full of relatively poor people. I didn't even know they had strip clubs in Scotland, not the kind of place you would imagine strip clubs to exist really. It's cold, wet, <b> nobody </b>has any money, high unemployment, high drug addiction and alcoholism.... I can imagine New Zealand being much more conducive to having high quality venues in comparison to Scotland.",

I think the reason other women call these girls sluts, whores.....etc...is out of their own insecurities about themselves. You know? I'm sure their are some strippers that are dirty hoes but their are some women lawyers that are too. I am confident enough in myself that these women don't offend me or make me say OMG how gross, she's a stripper that's so disgusting. Most of these girls are just trying to get by in this world just like the rest of us. Don't judge unless you've been in their heels \ud83d\ude00",

So the economy must be pretty wrecked out there. But still strip clubs are operated as totally different the USA. In the USA the girls pay a daily lease fee; so they pay for their use of the club so as they're on their own, and are of no obligation to the owner beyond that. They set their own price; for what here they charge per dance; at least 20 years ago in the part of Washington State of the USA, where I live. Which as makes sense. In Scotland it is more like socialism stripping; like a <b> communist </b>version of a strip club. Share and share alike. Where in the USA it is like everyone is an independent worker and every girl for herself. No one here shares with the boss in like a divvying scenario. If so? the girls would revolt, start up their own strip site on the net, and make a ton.",
