            "commentText": "This is a very accurate video. Older people are definitely pushed out of and not even considered for most jobs. Some of that is valid, as an older person you generally are not as up to the demands of a hard physical job. Also as an older person many of us are not as fast mentally as we used to be and can lose some memory ability. Having admitted older people have some downsides, it is my experience that most of the job bias is just pure predjudice. You only need to read the comments on this video to see how bad it is and how acceptable it is to demonize anyone who is in the 50 and older class. It is truly amazing to me how little the next generation understands the past and how much they seem to blame and hate their parents <b> age </b>group for things that are occuring now. Take today's young and put them where we were 35 years ago and very little would change but in those younger minds it's all about how selfish and stupid we boomers were and how we left<b>  nothing</b> for them.  It will be truly interesting if as the<b> y ag</b>e they grow out of this distorted view of their parents history. I suspect that they will as we the now aged boomers did  with our parents.",

I may be young today but I'm pretty accepting of the fact that I will be<b>  old</b>, as long as I do not die before I do. Yes we should sympathize with their issues but you can't sympathize and be understanding yet get told that you are being offensive. This is somewhat true wit<b> h gende</b>r issues as well. \nThe facts ar<b> e, o</b>ld ppl are weaker and lack motor skills in gene<b> ral\n</b>Old do not look the same as when they are young.

Contributing to a 401k instead of counting on social security is a responsible thing to do. Selling things and living within your means. Youths won't get social security even though we pay for it and you want to tax more to make it more luxurious? I'm making sacrifices while I'm young so that I'm not a burden on others. Maybe they should have to. We all pay for are short sightedness and the <b> elderly </b>seem to push there burden on young people. 14 trillion in debt unsustainable social programs set up like a pyramid scheme.

Why are you even driving when your on 15 meds of which 3 say don't drive and your completely checked out. So you can go to the golf course? While I just my balls at work but I'm just here to cater to you like I'm tired help because your a new Yorker and you deserve everything right? Dealt with this all my life here. That's boomers and I'm sry but things don't work like they used to. You need 2 jobs now to survive.you can't just go get a factory job, work 30 yrs and retire with a pension. That's gone and buying a house? Lol not an option when home prices go up and salaries have stayed the same",

Perception is a relative thing, I think, so the more 'essential' one is PERCEIVED to be, the more stellar and consistent the level of performance will be expected of them from that point on. My theory is that THIS is what leads to many suicides among public figures with declining popularity, or productivity... If not, simply creating higher stress levels and the health concerns that go with that stress.

I've always found that being centered on my spiritual beliefs has kept me up, not focusing so much on my outward self, but my inner kid, haha. Other people often think i'm younger than i am. One lady friend is in casting at Fox said that I have some 'neoteny,' or have kept some of the characteristics of youth a little longer than some folks, that i'm 'in the middle range' and that they're always looking for that trait because youth 'n good looks have been responsible for having sold about 90% of movie tickets since 1915, but that it's usually accompanied by a well maintained good attitude. \nI think of Peter Pan and Tinkerbelle almost every day because and keep a couple of their yt videos handy, even though i'm a big, straight guy. No apologies, I love to watch them fly, love them for what they 'are' and for teaching me about life when <b> age </b>4-5.  A sense of humor doesn't take much maintenance, so remember, at 24, your'e still young enough to have a considerable 'Huggies' budget and I've got a bottle warming up for ya right now ;) \nA light but 'genuine' smile lets a person watch the little things that happen at the fountain of youth, it's something you wear.",

But then they turn around and vote for politicians that lower taxes on the top 1% thus running huge deficits, they oppose social programs like medicare for all or even a homeless shelter in their community, they don't have any plan to stem student loan debt, etc. etc. Then they write articles blaming Millenials for struggling to succeed in the wasteland they've left behind after burning the ladders they used to reach relative stability.",

But real wages have gone way, way down.\nIt's not because women work, but because women and men work.  Two incomes creates more buying power, which causes higher prices in a competitive bidding market (i.e. real estate).  The home I was born in now lists for four times what my parents sold it for, that's an insane rate of inflation.  Single-earner families, which used to be the norm for the middle class, are now the purview of the elite (top earners) and the impoverished (regular and low earners).

A result of exactly 1.1 means population stability.  A result of less than 1.1 means population decline. \n\nThe result of Very Conservative American Women was 1.01, which reveals slow population decline that can be offset by limited, merit-based immigration.  Not surprisingly, this immigration policy is what Very Conservative American Women prefer. \n\nThe result for Very Liberal American Women was 0.6, which reveals massive population decline.  (I think the decline is so steep that it predicts extinction in three generations.)  Naturally, this means that Liberalism is, literally, a political dead end.  But Liberals use predatory policy practices to prevent themselves from admitting this, such as open borders immigration. \n\nLiterally every Liberal political policy, both foreign and domestic, is designed to minimize Liberals' relative inability to give birth and raise children.  It is the ultimate defining characteristic of every Liberal, and everything else is just a ruse.",
