        "postText": "A man who posed topless with a shotgun then posted photos online with racist captions has been jailed.', 'Jay Davison, 38, made the deranged posts on his private Instagram, urging people to \u2018Stand up\u2019.', 'Other posts and comments read: \u2018F**k you racist Allah c***s\u2019, \u2018Ever seen a white man cut a head off?\u2019 and \u2018Heil, heil, heil, f*** Allah c***\u2019.', 'His Instagram account \u2013 called Rudebina \u2013 was flagged up to police when a screenshot of his posts were sent to a community WhatsApp group.', 'He has now been jailed for four years.', 'Jennifer Josephs, prosecuting, said: \u2018These posts were extremely offensive.', '\u2018The images showed him bare chested holding a shotgun. He then left comments below those images.', '\u2018In his comments he talked about beheading and was using language that you normally associate with white supremacists.\u2019', 'He was arrested at his home in Rhiwbina, Cardiff, and told officers he had posted them after a heavy night of drinking.', 'Giving evidence during his trial Davison said: \u2018It was terrible judgement on my behalf and I should not have posted it. It was drunken stupidity. When I am sober I am a completely different person.\u2019', 'Davison denied posting material with the intention of stirring up racial and religious hatred.', 'But a jury took just over an hour to find him guilty of of one count of inciting religious hatred and two counts of inciting racial hatred.', 'He was found not guilty of two counts of inciting religious hatred.', 'Hashim Salman, defending, said: \u2018Although not immediately removed, the time it took for Davison himself to reach for the sense and for those senses to prevail and remove the material was short.', '\u2018Though not the strongest mitigation, his account was locked and private.', '\u2018He is disgusted and embarrassed with himself.\u2019', 'Sentencing Davison today to four years behind bars, Judge Tracey-Lloyd Clarke described his posts as \u2018extremely offensive\u2019.', 'She said: \u2018You posed with a fire arm stripped to the waist. Having done that you posted it on Instagram with extremely offensive messages intended to stir up racist and religious hatred.', '\u2018The manner and way you behaved reveals something of your inner thoughts and for you then to take a photo of yourself holding a firearm makes this a matter so serious only an immediate custodial sentence is appropriate.\u2019",
