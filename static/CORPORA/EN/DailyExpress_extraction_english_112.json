Years back, remember chatting to a sole trader heating engineer who was chokka with work and asking why not employ an apprentice.His reply was, he used to employ a dozen guys and took an appprentice every year except the constant changes in regs and paperwork meant he worked 7 days a week with he and his wife spending their Sundays solely on paperwork. Now, there 's just him - and he's now able to go on holiday - like everyone else ",

I am 61 and have been building a patio this last few weeks; I am totally incapable of digging and mixing concrete as I did in my 30's. My productivity is at least half. As regarding crawling around in peoples lofts etc, it would kill me. I can understand why in physically demanding jobs younger higher productivity staff are best and advisable. Now paper pushing or sales that's different. Heaven help those in the building trades when they are now expected to retire at 66 going on 67!!",
