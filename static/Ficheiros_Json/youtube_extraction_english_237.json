Obviously the opinions expressed in this video are those of individual interviewees alone and do not reflect the views of ASIAN BOSS or the general Chinese population, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they should get judged or ridiculed for speaking their mind. We want to cultivate an environment where people can have civilized discussions to bridge cultural gaps. As such, any personal name calling towards our interviewees will be deleted. What does having fair skin mean in your culture? Discuss",

Maybe I just have bad eyes but I can't see any difference between East Asia and European skin tones. The differences are facial features, not skin tone. I think in Spain we don't care so much about skin tone as in Northern Europe and East Asia, but if you are too pale people may say you look sickly.",

Also it is very well known that white people after the age of 25 and 30, especially the women, they go and appear to look like they are 45 or something, their skin quality turn real bad fast, it is also known that white people have bad odor problems, asians genetically have lesser sweat glands producing less body smell. so the stereotype that white people possesses all the good qualities are all false. Also in Japan there was or still is a trend of women going for a sun tan darker skin, so the stereotype that all asian women want fairer white toned skin is false aswell. Asian Boss is pathetically steering the conversation into a racial thing for clickbaits and is building up stereotypes instead of breaking them down....",

Colorism is mostly brought up by first generations immigrants like my parents. I grew up with an understanding the lighter the better. My dad is a dark skin man, but he's someone that will make remarks about darker skin, especially women. Me and my siblings we learnt the beauty of all skin tones and bleaching products are not allowed in my household, but I think our strength come from the fact that we live in the diaspora.  Grazie",

Blacks and Indian try to get closer with Pakistani.  Blacks, Bengali, and Indian men and women try to date, marry, and take advantage of Pakistani girls and boys plus they behave very dishonestly with Pakistani people.  Pakistani are very open minded towards Indian, Bengali, Whites, Chinese, Arabs, Afghan, Irani, Jews, Blacks, and Hispanics, but Pakistani don't get the same treatment from them but Pakistani are treated very dishonestly from them.

When in reality, white people should recognize how exotic they are to the rest of the world. White people don't realize that they're the minorities at 6% of the global population. So don't feel ashamed or made to feel guilty by others when you want to preserve your beauty and uniqueness <3 .\r Its okay for Asians to love and support each other.

Really wish Asians would stop with the skin lightening and those leg extending surgeries (ouch)... dark skin is beautiful.  It stays younger looking much longer, has nice glow.  Yeah its crazy that Asians dont see how beautiful they are, just as they are.\n\nAs for all the other that was surprising too.  I think Asians are better disciplined, persistent, determined, humble.  Respectful...\n\nIm sorry but Americans are arrogant, rude, self righteous, callous to poor and racist.  Im American...yes there some good things but sadly our culture been dumb down, greed run amok, self-degrading or the other extreme religion gone nuts and well The worst behaviors.  \n\nNo Asians take a relook, you have a lot to be Proud of.\n\nAmerica-West had good things, but greed and bigotry and Classism destroyed what was good.

It seems you have a close-minded world view. Many of us are appreciative of other cultures and want to do business. To benefit all- the whites and Chinese people! Stop giving us a bad image. Westerners are already \"fat and rich\" in the world's eyes. This is not true so we should stop perpetuating it. \n\nWhy not show them a better example of white people? Telling them to hate me for the color of my skin just creates more division. I want to do good for the world, to benefit and to help Chinese children. Am I really bad because I am white? When you learn to love the qualities of your own race, then you can appreciate Asian people for their qualities. You have very negative thoughts about white people also. That are more of a reflection of your personality than other white people. You are what you think.",

In my local area, my Spar has Russian and African staff. Kids don't see a difference between the staff and neither do the younger generation. However, I have seen some cases where the older generation would get agitated by slow service and blame it on the worker's race. I would generally step in and call it out. Typically speaking, having friends from different countries isn't a big deal. We don't see them differently or treat them differently, generally speaking. The only time when we would treat them differently is asking them questions about how life was in their country or just wanting to know more about their culture. Irish people  generally respect immigrants and will call out racist people.",

    "commentText": "Very handsome and beautiful Chinese Men and Women in this video, many in Europe also think you are attractive, with smooth skin and healthy long black hair, looking 20 years younger than your real age. Opposites attract and difference is exciting. Nothing wrong with that. When it comes down to it, attraction is not something you can control by political correctness. That's for you Asian Boss, you are seem unhappy with the fact that real Chinese are not affected by US style radical identitarian viewpoints. They are honest with themselves, we can learn from that. I respect these real Chinese people. Jamaicans and Africans and Asians want to bleach their skin, Europeans try to tan their skin, we all want to be different. Let us do as we wish without your judgement.",

    "commentText": "Let me tell you guys a few important and over-looked points (didn't even bother watching the end of the video tbh)\n1. Chinese people do not 'prefer' white people, people fall in love with people for many different reasons and the key actually is compatibility. I in-fact am a white person who grew up here in china, although I do get interests from girls from time to time but the MAJORITY would be too scared because of language barriers/culture differences. Once the language barrier goes, then goes the culture differences for me as I've grown up here too. HOWEVER it's a long haul because it gets explained every single time and Chinese people (girls) will get a lot of stigma from traditional people for dating a foreigner no matter who it is. On the other side of this, are the kind of girls that really are obsessed, have to speak english with you no matter how much it interferes with day to day life and are completely obsessed with the west and let me tell you they are the WORST kind of girlfriend a foreigner can actually have, they are full of prejudice and usually are having an identity crisis.\n2. This interview was done in a part of china that has the most foreigner influence of all cities... try doing this again in somewhere like Jiangxi or Fujian... LOL\n3. Someone mentioned below that Foreigners have a bad name in China due to the way they act, unfortunately this is true, Foreigners are on the whole, arrogant, unwilling to integrate and generally complain and look down upon the local people and have a lot of social drama. It's the few spoiling it for the many but if you are looking to come to China to work, teach, visit, whatever... remember you are the ambassador of where you are from no matter how tempting it is to slip up or just use being foreign as an excuse. Try find a decent job, and if you settle for a more undesirable job, do it to the best of your ability.",

    "commentText": "Its a weird thing to talk about, racial preferences and how foreigners are treated in their respective countries. For example, in Canada asians broadly are treated very well in reference to getting jobs. Its interesting to see that the reverse might be true in China, as for the racial partner preference its also weird, because alot of White guys (from the perspective of a white guy) prefer asian girls, where as Asian guys prefer asian girls mostly. At the higher echelons of every race there are undoubtable beauties. Also regarding the academic question, in Canada asians are pretty well known to to better at math and science, where white people tend to lean on philosophy, psychology, and history. I think in general asian people are more reserved, passive and quiet, and white people are more outspoken and brash, but in the end these are just stereotypes mixed with anecdotal evidence of my own, so take it for what its worth.",

People everywhere speaking their native language, and it's really cool. Probably part of the reason I'm so interested in languages now. Learning Korean, French, Spanish, and I want to learn Thai, German, Russian, and Chinese, and Japanese. I also want to teach other people the English language. I think that better communication does mean more acceptance and open-mindedness towards other cultures and races.\n\n(edit: last 5 words)",

It is was truly impossible to find any job without Chinese knowledge, regardless of how hard I have tried.  \nWhite skin: I really don't agree with the Chinese traditional consideration of white skin is more beautiful. My GF, and also other Chinese girls, are definitely more beautiful when they have dark(er) skin.  For me! However, protecting the skin from the sun is healthy as the ozone layer is already quite thin.\nChinese girls like a white man: I haven't noticed that. Maybe sometimes I have seen 1-1 girl,  but there is no significant difference than in other parts of the world.  Cheers,",

Even old french culture has similar perceptions. It's not about just looking \"white\", but more like fair-tone, subtle looking skin. Well, nowadays it's the opposite. A tanned and fit looking skin usually means one has the time to actually enjoy the sun instead of working indoor all the time.",

    "commentText": "The problem is how things are presented to students. For example its one thing to expose them to Western culture so that they may have some understanding of the outside world since Chinese society tends to be homogeneous (most people do not encounter other races or ethnic minorities on a daily basis), but its another thing to present these things in a way that paints other cultures as being better or something to aspire to. For example the girl who said having a white person represent a company is accepted by many as improving a company's image because this is a traditional mindset. What? Lol a traditional mindset would be something like respect for the family ancestral line or the honoring of ancestors through food offerings and prayer. She even used the word ÂÇ≥Áµ± to describe it. How can worshipping white people be traditional when white people barely got on the scene? Either that girl has no idea what ÂÇ≥Áµ± means or she doesnt know traditions because the traditional culture has been lost. If you interviewed real Chinese people meaning ones that know the actual culture and dont just look Chinese on the outside, this video would be a LOT different. Also Chinese can have skin lighter than white people and darker than white people. The preference for light skin stems from farm workers being outside traditionally and thus tanning and having darker skin, whereas lighter skinned people did not do manual labor and could be inside. It has nothing to do with so-called white people such as Europeans but many of them like to think that way to make themselves feel better. Another way in which white people bend the truth to make themselves feel superior. I guess they have to do that because fantasy is all they have. But whats new",

In ancient China, people thought that lighter skin colour shows a higher social class, cuz they wouldn't work as farmers or be working-class people. And most Chinese people around me tend to think that lighter skin is just prettier, regardless of social classes or status. And also when it comes to thoughts that white people are more good looking, it really depends on the individual experiences. Most people haven't actually met or seen many ordinary people from outside the country, and therefore they are easily influenced by celebrity images. It can also be interpreted as people want what they don't have. To be frank, I, as an asian Chinese, don't really think that white people are prettier, and I really don't understand the way they understand 'white', cuz people from different area do look differently, even they are all called white people.",

When most of us aren't born with naturally massive eyes, V-shaped faces (which looks unnatural to me if it's surgically achieved) and high bridges. It makes me sad that young girls have these ideals imposed on them instead of being allowed to develop their own opinion and identity. If we spent as much time on our character and just being a decent human being, the world would be a MUCH better place.",

I get that \"oh my god, anything i say is going to sound completely stupid\" feeling,  like im just gonna stand here and stare at the floor and hope no one asks me anything. It seems to me that most people being interviewed in videos like these on youtube, are rather nice and polite, id love to interact with people like that, if i can get past the \"i feel so dumb\" stage.  I love the culture because its very traditional yet extremely modern, so its very interesting to me to see the balance as well as it appears to be.  Love the videos my friends.",

Currently, the african population in Europe is at 2.5%. But by your logic, this lowers the overall iq from 103 down to 99. Bear in mind, there are also a sizeable population of east asians residing in Europe (iq between 105 - 108) which would be increasing the iq. A good example of a European country which is predominantly 'caucasian' is Iceland, which has an average iq of 101, still considerably less than East asian countries. As for the inventions, well done. I take my hat off, but that doesn't take away the fact that caucasians are still about 5+ iq points lower east asians.",

Im a white man from Sweden and i,ve always prefered Asian women but to be honest most people are not interested in mixing races but i,ve got a few friends who rather look for an Asian women to start a family with. Its not easy to find them even though we have plenty here since Asian people usually hang in their own circles. Everyone is beautiful to someone but most importantly you gotta love yourself first and thats not an easy task. And if any Asian guy reads this, there are plenty of white girls who like Asian guys all you have to do is to get some confidence cause from my experience asian guys seem to believe white chicks dont want them but there is plenty of white women who would love a confident Azn dude, i,ve known plenty of beautiful Swedish girls who would SMASH ;) <3",

We all use our own preferences when judging others.  Since I have (relatively) sharp facial features, when I was in college I thought Indian females with sharper facial features were better looking that ones with rounder facial features.  In life you have to just be happy with who you are.  Females who liked tall Asian guys with sharp facial features liked me, people who didn't like my look, didn't like me.  So be it.  You can't please everyone.  In the end it doesn't matter because you only need your last significant other to like you.  Also, you are forgetting that \"looks\" are only one aspect.

I have almond-shaped eyes just like most Asians, and even though I'm quite tall, often have 5 o'clock shadow, and have a large Adam's Apple, I've had cases where Caucasian males chase after me across the room only to have me give them a look of \"why the heck are you chasing me\" then they realize I'm a man.  I don't have any other aspect that is feminine except my almond-shaped eyes and \"fair\" skin and perhaps thin build.  Btw, I have nothing against the individuals who get turned on by almond-shaped \"feminine\" eyes.  It's not their fault.  They've been taught by media that almond-shaped eyes = feminine.",

Plus Asians born in Asia have a different priority system and usually care more about intelligence, loyalty, devotion, compatibility, family, etc than physical appearance when choosing partners.  People from western society tend to place a higher importance to physical appearance when choosing partners.  This is why it's very conflicting for Asians who are born in western society.  Basically, ABCs, ABJs, ABKs, CBCs, CBJs, CBKs, etc. have to strike a balance.

But you don‚Äôt need colonization to get colonial mindset and automatically assume that white people are from a superior race. It‚Äôs just a mindset, set by British, Europeans colonies from centuries for Asians, Africans, etc. and it is the dirtiest mind game they have played for the longest time in history, to make the Africans or Asians feel that they are less than them due to their color. And Americans play that card too, especially with their Native americans even today. Mindset never seems to change.",

    "commentText": "The desire to be white or to have fair color of face happens not only in China but in all Asian countries. This is a serious identity problem throughout Asia.  I hardly see any dark skinned actors or actress on TV in India, the Philippines or Malaysia where most people have dark skin.  Thailand too.  Korea is the leader in cosmetic surgery operations and skin whitening products.  It is too bad, people are brainwashed by the white-trash mentality.  That is the reason Asians still cannot form its own alliance or free trade agreement among Asian countries like the North America's Free trade or the organization like NATO.  Asians are not working together but they often working against each other among themselves for the West leading by the US to take advantage of.  Asians rather have the control by the control freak US than work together with China for common goals to make Asia a more peaceful, more stable, and more prosper place for all Asians to enjoy.  Rising China has made positive contribution to all of Asia.  But other Asian countries see that as threat to them.  How come they never complain about the control over them by the US who is the most powerful and control freak in the world?  How can China control them more than the US?  How much the US has benefited Asian countries economically and politically?  You don't have to look further,.  Just look countries that are allies to the US, have their countries do better or worse?  The Philippines is a good example that it has been the ally of US for long time, but it is still one of the poorest and most corrupted country in Asia if not in the world.  By the way, Philippine has been doing well for a country after having good term with China.  Singapore is a good example of country that don't listen or controlled by the US blindly and doing exceptionally well.  In fact, Singapore is the best in Asia in many aspect.  Again, Singapore has a balanced relationship between China and the US.",

I found the Chinese to be open and friendly and expressed a desire to be friends and live in peace with westerners. Even strangers on the street were often eager to say \"Hello!\" and speak with me.  (I was also told by a Beijing physician's wife who sat next to me on the flight over that \"The Chinese people do not like the Japanese people!\" (with a tight smile on her face) when I asked if she had ever toured Japan.  I spent time in Beijing, Chongqing & Chengdu, but since I worked for Simon Legree at that time, I could stay for only two weeks and missed out on Hong Kong and Shanghai.",

I was born and raised in Kenya and now live in the U.S, my friends from Kenya don't get white standards of beauty. Prior to being exposed to what the western world found beautiful, many holly wood actresses were honestly very unattractive to me, I just didn't get why they were found beautiful. On that note, I notice white women in Kenya often go for Maasai and Samburu men and I realized it's because they fit the western standard of beauty. Slim, tall, high cheek bones, etc. I notice though East Asia and the West seem to heavily focus on features and the form of the body in a way we don't. Heck, the Belgians literally enforced a hierarchy in Rwanda based on the tribe that was more \"caucasian\" looking... I also find that what East Asians find to be beautiful among their own might not even get a glance from the average person in the West. I for instance do not get the appeal of many Asian idols but there are millions of women screaming about how attractive they are. From all the colonial literature, white people are just described as sick looking.",

    "commentText": "I'm sorry but, I'll have to disagree with most of the comments on here. Yes everybody's entitled to their own opinion, including myself. But, even though the history says that, pale equals rich and dark equals poor. Asian people still have a color complex and superiority complex. This doesn't count for the entire race but, most of them do feel this way. People can say what they want, if I and my family went to China right now, my husband who is white and my kids because they have fair skin and white hair, would automatically be considered as Superior. But me, because I'm black with dark beige skin or tan, whatever you want to call it. I would be considered unattractive, dangerous and, possibly poor because I'm darker than my family. Asian people have worshipped and put white people on a pedal stool for decades and centuries now. Like I said before, not the entire race feels this way, but most of them have and still do. And the reason why they do this is because, most of them learn what they see on television and a base people off what they see on mainstream and not to mention, most jobs and companies are owned and ran by white people. So, they'll assume that \"white is right\" and they don't even like themselves so which means, they don't like anybody else. I think most of these people have a mental issue and self-hate for themselves and others and, it needs to be corrected with communication, education and self-help. Because, it will never get better and it will never change, if they don't. To look at yourself and others and feel that, you're inferior and someone else is Superior; is a mental problem. I think Asian people and anyone else including black people, can be beautiful and good and, I don't think you have to be white to be polite and kind. You can just be yourself and be all those things, no matter what color you are.",

But some may feel sad because they was born to look a certain way and would rather want the features that others have. It's not a bad thing but it's also not a good thing either. When choosing a love partner though having a preference for particular features is a good thing though but just as long as your not being a jerk towards or bashing anyone else just because their preferences are different or whatever else. However you yourself are born into this world with your appearance choosing you and not you choosing your appearance but this could change in the future with technology getting more and more sophisticated and because of genetic engineering. I am definitely against plastic surgery and all that fake rubbish aswell anyway.",

I think they came to this conclusion because most whites in China are probably educated enough to value its culture, and any English speaker who decides to learn Mandarin is likely to be \"ambitious\" in many ways because it is a VERY difficult language to learn as an English speaker. Basically, only the the ambitious and/or educated ones will actually make it out to China. I see plenty of uneducated slobs here in the US. Here, it is the opposite: it is generally though that Chinese are much more industrious. I haven't visited China so I can't say if that's true or not.",

    "commentText": "As a white guy who often goes to the PRC (with a really weird situation, I am an ROC, ie Taiwan passport holder but not of Chinese origin) I would say a few things. 1) This was done in Shanghai. Probably the most open city and most receptive to foreigners in mainland China (only HK or ShenZhen can compare). 2) I found a strange situation that even though I am a Taiwan passport holder and lived here longer than anywhere else, I found as a white guy in Taiwan I face some idiotic ideas (you can't survive in your \"own country\"...). In PRC I found the workers and customers were more OK with respecting the knowledge I had about technical aspects of work than in Taiwan. The Chinese Taiwanese I met there were really friendly to me as soon as they heard me talk, because they noticed my accent etc and straight away knew from my talking what accent that was but if you are a non-Chinese immigrant (some of who were already here several generations because of those who came in 1949 from mainland China but were not Han Chinese...) or Aboriginal Taiwan citizen here in Taiwan you will face some bad attitudes here in Taiwan. On the other hand it it is really frustrating in PRC when we (the 5% or so of ROC, ie Taiwan people) who are not ethnically Chinese people can't believe we exist, say some BS like \"this can't be real, you are not Chinese and all Taiwanese are Chinese\". I often went to ShenZhen and DongGuan. For me one thing great about there is so many people are not from there so they easily understand what it is like to be an outsider. I know many people who go to BeiJing and some other places have a more negative view.",

    "commentText": "Don't sell yourselves short, good cheekbones and beautiful smiles are universally attractive and many find almond shaped eyes to be so as well. The funny thing about a pale skin preference as a sign of class (not working under the sun) is that in the West being super pale is seen as being 'low class' because you're perceived as either a basement dweller or chained to a cubicle to the point where you don't have access to the sun. Though I think in the West a better known indicator of class is how rough a person's hands are, indicating manual labour. \n\nHow are foreigners treated in Canada? I think it's best to ask them how they feel they're received. I can say this though, no one is likely to point at a Chinese person walking down the street and say 'look a foreigner!' because I think the default assumption given our multicultural society is that they're probably not foreign. I mean 1.5 million Chinese Canadians live in Canada, so why would you want to alienate your neighbour?",

    "commentText": "To anyone who knows anything about east asian culture known they have been a very segregated society for very long. Either it was a monarchy or dictator ship but all of them had their nobles, and nobles don't work. Since work was majority done in the farms and fields people would get tanner from doing such works. So nobles had a fair skin compared to the ones who worked. Since humans are incredibly driven by aesthetics and looks this became a norm, to the point the nobles would paint themselves with rice powder.\nThis skin distinction wasn't so pronounced in Europe because the sun doesn't shine so bright in those latitudes and the place is cold, so even under the sun you'll be wearing clothes to protect your skin. In fact, rich people nowadays are inverted in such sense in American and European cultures. They have a lot of time to travel so they are constantly tanned and people that work a lot have lighter skin because they spend their time working inside buildings who don't happen to tan their skin!",

Also for the guy who said that \"whites have better features and we just have to admit that.\" seriously feel sorry for his children because he is going he is going to teach them that hate themselves as soon as they can start to understand. That is just a really sad way of thinking man. every individual has negatives and positives to their features depending on who's looking at them. Like some Asians have surgery to widen their eyes and I think that that's what makes them special because they have the slanted eyes or  some people say that they hate their big lips and then other people have kiss someone with big lips and become addicted. Really  we're all one big hodge-podge of DNA, recessive and dominant genes that's it.",

I use to live in Foshan, and I never felt so comfortable, safe and welcomed. To me, it does not really matter if Chinese look whiter or darker, their skin does not determine the traits of their character.  There are many ugly shrubs, which produce much fruit, while there also lovely looking trees that lack a produce in the time of harvest. It is the inside that counts. Many of the products that these ladies use to whiten their skin can also cause cancer, a risk not worth taking. Be yourself, what you are and natural, not what other people think you should be.",

China‚Äôs admiration of whiter skin color is not at all coming from white people per se, but rather it‚Äôs because in the old times, if you work on a outdoor job, like farming, you are much more likely to be exposed under the sun extensively resulting in darker skin,whereas  if you come from a more well off family, you mostly work indoor and less likely to have darker skin. People usually perceive each other through the darkness of the skin to determine their social class. There‚Äôs tons of ancient literature to prove this, nothing to do with the white guys.",

The trend is also always going top-down. Without taking the influence of globalization, fair-skin has been considered as one of the major beauty standards for women in China starting from hundreds years ago. I think it will continue to stay but the concept of beauty is also changing along with social economical transformation.",

And for thousands of years only wealthy people who don‚Äôt work outside are capable to keep their skin fairly, and normally a wealthy guy would be able to find a good looking wife and they received more education which made them look graceful. Therefore, when fair skin often combines with pretty face and graceful manners, after thousands of years, it became part of the traditional beautiful standard. But I personally think as long as the skin is smooth and healthy the color doesn‚Äôt matter.",

It is accurate to say that the appearance of most white people does not conform to the aesthetic concept of Chinese people . We like to use white people because European and American economies are more developed than those in other regions. Product quality is generally better than other regions. White people are yellow people. Black people are only used in European and American countries to distinguish racial differences. Actually racial discrimination. Although many people in Europe and the United States have higher levels of education than Asians, it is a matter of the past. Nowadays, Asians are not inferior to Europeans and Americans. Europe and the United States also have low-quality and racial discrimination, especially racial discrimination. This is very serious in Europe and America. These people have not been to Europe and the United States. They only understand that some people are not all. There is also the name of this channel Asian boss? We Chinese people never think that we are the biggest boss in Asia. This channel is South Korea. It's not our Chinese. We don't have the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbeing the boss. We just want to be able to self-strengthen, not invade other people, and not be invaded. Peaceful coexistence",

    "commentText": "but isnt this the true philosophical debate? you always want the thing that is most different from you, or find it attractive. Now for me, im an average looking white guy, I always thought asian women, like japanese were soo much more beautiful compared to alot of the american women ive dated. But now I live in Japan, I find the opposite is true. Alot of the japanese women, tell me, it is very exciting for them to be with a foreign guy, and that, that is the ideal vision of beauty. Its interesting for me, because I have always felt completely the opposite. Them, oh foreigners, are more beautiful. Me, oh yea Japanese are more beautiful. So then goes the fact that whichever is farthest away from you, or opposite of you, would be obviously very attractive. Personally Ive always like asian women, cuz I think they look very exotic, compared to average americans, which is this huge mixing pot. So it goes to show you just love what is not you. Asians will love blue eyes, cuz all them have black/brown. Asians will love blonde hair, cuz they all have black/brown hair. I have mixed, colored eyes, but also kind of brownish, Ive always loved if a girl has blue eyes of course. If a girl has black eyes and is asian, its fine too. What most matters to me is a cute face, because, that is what i have to talk to everyday, kiss, etc. One that does not wear too much makeup, a little sometimes ok however. She has a nice smile, etc. This seems to be the most important.  The point is, people from one continent, lets say the asia area, will obviously be very attracted to the complete opposite looking person, say america, and alot of americans the same. but I think it matters how much you have dated.. etc.",

Preference of white or bright skin in Korea isn't really related to white people. Even some people online in Korea make fun of it by the words that some westerner, who thinks Asian prefer white or bright skin because we like Caucasian skin ,says about Asian preference on white or bright skin.",

Although western facial appearance is indeed appreciated in China, we are also proud of our own Asian features. There's no meaningful comparison between these two kinds of beauties. Actually, it's very apparent that Chinese are having more diversified views about beauty, which can be found in the popularity of a new superstar, Wang Ju ÁéãËèä. Just search for her and you will understand. ;))",

We have a teacher shortage in NZ because of salary and the working conditions. Lots of people are leaving this profession because they feel undervalued. Wages are low in comparison to living costs which are high and that is not an appealing way to live. I've lived in Australia before and want to get out of my comfort zone and immerse myself in a different culture. Having international experience looks good on your resume as well. The knowledge I gain from working in China will help me teach Chinese children if/when I go back home, plus earning close to double will help me save quicker and pay off my student loan from studying. Is it so wrong to want to learn about a different culture?",

They absolutely worship pale skin and by extension any average pale skinned person. One trip to Shanghai was enough for me to understand this. The overwhelming white male asian female combo is everywhere to see in western countries these days - US, Canada, UK, Australia, NZ, Germany, France and many others. Primary factor driving this combo is pale skin obsession of asians, particularly females. Its not going to change any time soon. It will be atleast another fifty to hundred years for this attitude to change a little. It's actually quite sad the whole society thinks like that. Guess what - the most attractive girl in this video - the darker toned girl. I'll take her any day!",

It depends on what part of China you're in though. mostly people stare at you , take pictures of you, start talking with you in English for practice, (I could be wrong, but I feel like I got charged more money for the same items) , though almost always people are very polite and kind towards you. I guess some people might not like their picture getting taken randomly, but I don't mind it. One time in a bus, I had my feet resting on the empty chair in front of me, and a man who spoke English quite well started scolding me for it. ( I didn't know at the time that it could be considered rude to do that)",

They spent a good deal of time talking about pale skin and everything, not Caucasians or racial superiority or anything. Here's some background story. People in China generally believe that having dark complexion means you are a peasant because only peasants working in the field would get sun tan. This belief remains unchanged for centuries. Interestingly, the European aristocracy shared the same belief long time ago. The entire French court in the 17th century, and later the Brits, was so obsessed with \"white\" face that all aristocratic women and men painted their face white, even though the makeup contained lead and caused a lot of damage to their facial skin. Additionally, many African cultures prefer pale skin over dark one, and for that reason, skin bleaching has been a common practice for centuries in many tribes or regions in Africa, despite the fact that it can cause healthy concerns and some countries, including South African, have even banned it. So it has nothing to do with SELF-HATE. It's just a cultural thing.",

    "commentText": "I live in the west, and majority of white people here are absolutely trash as far as education and professional know-how, together with a 9-to-5 mentality and poor work ethics. Also it is very well known that white people after the age of 25, especially the women, they go and appear to look like they are 45 or something, their skin quality turn real bad fast, it is also known that white people have bad odor problems, asians genetically have lesser sweat glands producing less body smell. so the stereotype that white people possesses all the good qualities are all false. Also in Japan there was or still is a trend of women going for a sun tan darker skin, so the stereotype that all asian women want fairer white toned skin is false aswell. Asian Boss is pathetically steering the conversation into a racial thing for clickbaits and is building up stereotypes instead of breaking them down....",

I suggest you guys do some research before describe Chinese ppl as self-hate one.Especially, many Tang Dynasty's poems on imperial concubine Yang, Êù®Ë¥µÂ¶É are needed for your reading. To fully understand China, you should be a master of Chinese language and get first hand information rather Jewish control propaganda, if you don't trust any Chinese media, you could do your research in China, and you should not just focus in several international metropolis like Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Hong Kong etc, you should visit small cities and urban areas. It's time to you remove your blinkers and view the world objectively. Prejudice can't slove the problem, only communication can. Don't let me down with you guys. And we are all human beings!

I find it sad that such attractive people wish they could be something else. It‚Äôs a narrow definition of beauty that Americans don‚Äôt really understand I think. I also think it‚Äôs important to realize they are not trying to look white to attract white people or because they think white people are better but they have certain very specific beauty standards.  As close as I got to that was growing up in California and even though I was a tall blue-eyed blonde with an x-shaped body I didn‚Äôt tan well, which in California is a must. So instead of being confident in myself I‚Äôd cover up my body in long pants and shirts even in 98 degree weather because I was embarrassed about my white skin. My point is, I should have embraced who I was and showed off my nice body confidently even if it wasn‚Äôt tan. I should have loved myself more. I wish I could go tell my teen self to just enjoy the beach and not hide. I would finally get tan at the end of the summer and be happy the last two weeks of summer , how stupid! I‚Äôve finally learned to accept my whiteness now but I wish had done so earlier. Confident, considerate, intelligent and funny  guys of whatever race and body type are sexy",

    "commentText": "edit: I'm surprised that this comment has gotten so much attention, let me reiterate for those who are not familiar with the situation in Asian countries (for those who have or are living in Asian countries, you know what I'm saying). The definition of a trash foreigner is someone who 1). doesn't have the ability or credential but gets much higher pays (sometimes through lying) when compared to locals with more work experiences or higher educational background 2). (Most importantly) abuses the culture and its people, use their nationality or ethnicity to get laid, talk trash about the country and its people while enjoying all the undeserved love (sometimes the symptoms can be not able to speak a word in the local language even after years of living there) . I've seen and heard of so many cases where foreigners find at least a dozen girls over the span of weeks; there are always cases of rape, obnoxious behaviors (e.g: Logan Paul and Ricegum) etc. You cannot compare immigrants to the US to these kinds of foreigners in China, immigrants are hardworking people trying to fit in and trying to make a decent living. Those trash foreigners only want to get sex and easy money \n and GTFO of the country they are taking advantage of. The foreigner scene in China is polarizing, divided between extremely openminded and or well-educated individuals and absolute trash. \n\nOriginal comment: Honestly, I think if they understand the \"foreigner scene\" in China more, the more disappointed they will be. Many foreigners in China (especially whites from more developed nations) are so-called trash foreigners, basically meaning they are the people that cannot find jobs in their home country so decided to move to China to seek opportunities (by taking advantage of their white looks). It's sad to see how people believe those people to be more knowledgeable and capable than hard-working young locals.",

        "commentText": "Let me explain you: when a Chinese goes to your country to work it's about the individual. If you go to China to work, the point is \"what does China need?\". This is why the law states that if same conditions, the Chinese must be hired first, and why workers withouth great background will not be accepted, as they are not useful for the country.\n\nYet you will see a citizen from a country thas has that mentality (which is legit, of course, the have the right to manage their own country as they wish) call you loser or trash when in fact you will only work there if you're very good at your field. Forget about the \"honest and willing workers\" because that doesn't apply to China, it's not about honesty, it's about filling the needs of the country in a way a Chinese would not be able to (that's what the law says, obviously there are many Chinese workers who are just excellent, my working place, just to set an example, has many of them). It's legit, of course, but that doesn't deny the fact that it's hypocritical to say this when you're exporting low-background workers to other countries and only welcoming those who are highly qualified.\n\nSo what's with the \"taking advantadge thing\"? Actually it's part of the Chinese racism, parents want a foreign face to claim how good his kid is at English, it's also about face, reputation, call it the way you want. A black teacher with a Princeton degree may be the best option you will ever have, but if you hire him the parents won't be able to tell his friends and relatives that his kid is in a western sophisticated environment, because his teacher his black, who knows if he may come from Africa? So, who creates the topic? The black/white teacher, or the costumers that are behind that? But here you see the final result by reading the comments: the Chinese being racist it's your fault, so you should be ashamed because they have the right to be racist. \n\nDon't get me wrong about that, to me it's very disgusting to see parents cheated in such a terrible way, paying a lot of money that they earned by working hard just to have an unqualified teacher. Anyway, academies cannot hire foreigners, so this is why they look at their skin and not at their background.",

Anyway it's a rude move to call someone ignorant when it's clearly far from the truth, you are just too angry for some reason, have some respect.",

People want fair skin, but they don't want White people's skin. they don't want flat nose, but they don't want White people's nose either. No one really have issue with black hair in China, some Korean did have this problem in early 2000. It is a super old fashion now. In a Chinese movie, if you see a Chinese man with blonde hair, it means one of these two\n\n1. uneducated teenager migrant worker making minimal wage in the city. He could kill someone or be killed any minute tragically in the movie just to show how unfair the world is.  \n2. young kids into k-pop, usually have bad grade in school.",

Europeans or English have gone around 98% of the world with this doctrine about about being fair. Even corrupt religion from its original form to have white as pure or innocent or beautiful. Dark is negative black is negative. THIS is everywhere africa western carribean latin America. Black is negative and its all an illusion politically incorrect. Japan the same.

Yes, it's true that in times past, light skin meant high class due to indoor working conditions. But it's also true that there is a correlation between light skin and high IQ ants dark skin and low IQ, so the high class people were light skinned both because of working conditions and genetics. It's also true that western beauty is the standard, not because of racism or propaganda, but because western features are more objectively beautiful, so over the centuries prominent, wealthy, and royal people (these were mainly competent and intelligent men) chose beautiful women with western features creating a eugenics situation and a class of beautiful, intelligent, ambitious people who were naturally the high/prestigious class in any given nation. \n\nIf beauty standards only came about due to the perceptions of high class, then fat and physically weak men (and women for that matter) would be preferable to thin and physically strong because wealthy people had better access to food and didn't have to preform manual labor making them less physically fit compared to the working class.",

You left that out because plastic surgery to get all of those things are extremely popular in Asia. I think the farmers excuse is really played out doesn't really make any sense, genetics deal with how fair or how tan you are going to be. It would be completely insane to say all the rich people in Asia back then were pale, so thats saying NO tan people had money, thats a lie. The sad thing about the plastic surgery and pale skin is that they want \"westerner\" features but still look Asian after getting the surgeries ( Asian people love who you are) not all but majority. There is nothing wrong with doing any of that because its YOUR body and if you can change you should. But there is an issue when you wont admit to why you want to change it. Plus people in  Asian countries need to learn that not all westerners are white, we come in all colors of the rainbow.

Beauty is not definitive.\nIt's internalized and that's scary but they have to WANT to change their mentality. You see it in Asian animated shows too. All the characters look Caucasian... its funny how to be beautiful one girl said you have to be fair and tall...well it's obviously a ploy to wrangle money from normal citizens because the average person in China isn't fair and isn't tall at All! but the companies will tell you so and you will keep spending money to change things you can't change.\n\n In Africa we have issues with skin whitening too but not as standardised. So many darker skinned women who are beyond lauded but skin and \"good hair\" are seen as better.",

I also saw vids of white little kids swearing and also i heard kids as young as 11 leave their parents and lead an independent life and here me at 17 still consider myself a kid. Indian kids r so cool. They r innocent and always playing around and running around and not so oversmart like those white kids. I like white teens who r 13 and older. I know because i spent time with kindergarten, 1st grade and 2nd grade boys all indians and they ask me candies daily and never sweared at me and were asking me to be their friends tbh because i give them candies",

It's a beauty standard comes from ancient time when we didn't even know the existence or white people. Not sure why ancient chinese like jade-like skin. But for modern chinese girls, we know we have flatter face. Being a little brighter makes complements the gentleness of our smaller nose and eyes, being fair makes us feels not that flat and gives us more confidance.  Fair skin makes us feels ourselves more girly, I guess due to ancient culture somehow as well.  It's definately NOT about race. If chinese girls have more dimensional face that looks good with any skintone,  nobody would cares about being brighter or not. We are always saying how sexy and healthy the  dark skin foreign people look.",

Anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of Chinese culture knows that Chinese society has always been obsessed with women having extremely fair skin.

(I only know this because I am totally obsessed with ancient China and everything about it.) China has a know history of 5000 years, and that is just when China became a country. And the being fair tradition thing came along maybe 4000 years ago, it doesn't specifically say, but that is just what I infer. I am almost definite that back then, 99% of the Chinese people never saw somebody with a western white complexion. Just a correction for Xuan Zh, did you mean that in the ancient times Chinese people, especially girls liked to wear jade? Because nobody that I am aware of in human history has had natural green skin. Or perhaps you meant that the skin was really like soft and shimmery( Even though skin can't shimmer), I just can't translate it to English, and Google Translate says that it means crystal clear, but that is wrong too. Anyways, in Chinese, it is Êô∂ËéπÂâîÈÄè. Please correct me if I am wrong.",

It's a standard comes from ancient time, even before we knew the existance of white people. I don't know how ancient asian thinks, but now Its just that we east asian have flatter face, being brighter can make our features doesn't look that flat, and compliments the gentleness of our smaller eyes and nose, makes us feels we are cuter somehow. Its hard to describe. Its definately not about race. A lot of us think darker skin races are beautiful and sexy, if we have more dimensional face, we wouldn't care about being whiter or not.",

European countries are more developed in the past century. In Chinese culture, I think deep down people only worship power and money. That's the reason many Chinese feel white folks are superior. But as Chinese economy has been growing, even though individually our living standard still has a lot to catch up with the West, the nation itself has become a huge power that cannot be ignored. So more and more Chinese stopped looking up to white folks and the West and start having a false sense that Chinese are the best.

This is your 50 cent army, hardliner, who repeats \"East Asia Unite\", no matter whether they are Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc... They also hold a ton of contempt for Asians they deem inferior, or have assimilated into other cultures.\n2. Intellectuals. People who value history, science, and just have a general respect for the process of learning and studying itself. These Asian people are smart, and they know it, and they have clear reason for their pride, reasons they are generally willing to share. \n3. Propagandists with Intellectual Capacity. These are Asian people you can still learn from. They share genuine information with you at first, but eventually reveal an unsubstantiated and strong Asian Supremacy, and these people usually hold contempt for Asians they deem inferior, similar to the Propagandists.\n\nI am most interested by your comments.

It reminds me of how I lived in South Africa and had relatively peaceful days interacting with different races, then I moved away and apparently, people in South Africa are killing each other over race. Then again, this is anecdotal. Also, I feel to weirdly prove your point, you've also somehow vouched for the other side. Especially with your drivel about men pursuing women. Honestly, it has done nothing to prove that Asians don't worship white men (I personally don't care if they do, that is not my problem as a Kenyan, I am solely interested in \"decolonizing the mind\" a la Ngugi Wa Thiong'o ). Also, there are plenty of white countries and Asian countries with higher homicide rates than a good portion of Africa. Also, it is Indian Americans that push the earning gap for Asians. Not sure why that goes unnoticed, but other Asian groups aren't out earning anyone. Furthermore, to come at the black race when countries like Korea have the highest per capita plastic surgery rate is just something. On that note, not sure how we went down this path when white supremacy and the Western world have affected both continents negatively. I notice Churches in Asia are filling up slowly and in Africa they have been full for a long time. I notice that music in Asia is largely becoming rap and bubble gummy pop. At least Africa has seen a rise of Afro pop but folk music is to my discontent, dying. I have no intentions of getting married but honestly, finding a good partner in life is difficult so if you are married outside of your race and it makes you happy, so be it. I am also one of those black women who wears their naturally curly hair and quite frankly, there is a massive hair movement in the black community right now which is great! I will say, I see more of these type of moments in the black community than Asian community which is probably why there is the assumption that Africans have more pride. I might not necessarily agree with aspects of that. On that note, I have no solutions so I am relatively useless to this conversation.",

Caucasians are white and tall because they eat hamburgers\". Not only to whites, but historically japan has always had an inferiority complex even towards their neighbors who are taller and have more built statures. That is why so many japanese even today spread rumors about koreans getting plastic surgery. But koreans or chinese have no interest in japanese peoples appearance.",

Growing up like this in the U.S. was hell for lack of better word. I was called names and bullied before I was even in kindergarten. A 'joke' that my middle school classmates would play on me (several times) was dumping a whole bottle of spray tan lotion on me. I always felt ugly and gross because I wasn't tan or even peachy like normal Caucasian people. The first time anyone ever genuinely referred to me as \"beautiful\" was in Japan.\nIt's so strange to see how the west and east are such polar opposites on this subject. And also how both go to extremes to reach the \"ideal\" skin tone.",

For the same reason we are all drawn to different artists and their styles, we are also all drawn to different physical human traits. Whether I prefer white/black/brown/orange or any other color skin/hair/clothing, that doesn't say anything about my philosophy or my world view. It shows what I find aesthetically pleasing.

Women want to be seen as the smaller and \"fairer\" sex biologically regardless of any socially imposed feminist ideology. Guys also want to be seen as more bigger, masculine and stronger than women, and since having darker skin to females plays to all of those \"male\" attributes, guys also prefer women with a lighter skin tone to themselves. Of course it depends on the general skin tone of that group of people.\n\nI'm a Latin guy with light brown (type 3/4 skin), and I also prefer women with a skin tone at the very least a little lighter than my own and I don't really think of it any differently compared to preferring a woman shorter in height than myself. However, unlike height, skin colour is not a deal breaker for me all at all. Height, body shape and personality are far more important to me in a woman than skin tone. \n\nMy experience with women here in the UK by the way is that they prefer the same when it comes to men. That is probably why tanning is so popular here among both men and women.",

So while she didn't explicitly say liti was better, in the context of the sentence she meant that they were. She was listing liti as a reason they are more attractive. That's how the sentence works. \nThe man did not explicitly say he found them more attractive, and instead said they were liti (but he implied it a little by saying that they look like statues.) So the translation isn't literal, but took context into account. I agree that the mans words could be translated slightly more literally though.",

Maybe you need to go study Chinese again better, or re-watch the actual video? And not try and shittalk Asian Boss so much just because their views don't fit in with your own agenda/views. Based on what the people were saying about statues and the like, they definitely were not implying the stuff in a negative light. On the contrary, despite what the translations tried to paint, objectively it seems like they all acknowledged that looking \"western\" is an in right now, especially with how products and brands invite western people to model and how businesses use western people to appear more distinguished as a business. Don't know why people get so antsy over this kind of stuff.",

White husbands thinking they can speak on asian issues simply because their partner is asian. What a joke of a race this has become.

Yes , they and myself do prefer fair skin but isn't it the same how people here prefer taned skin? Though I live where a country contains 84% whites , I actually try to avoid them (like a lot of chinese people I know) if i don't know them. From past experience,  there is quite a few that are racist. Not all whites are racist ,of course, but I've only ever been discriminated from them. I used to feel sad from those comments but i don't care about them anymore- it's more to avoid feeling embarrassed for their parents now .\n\nEdit: I've also only ever seen Asian and Asian couples( Chinese and/or other Asians )and not so much with other races.\nP.s A chinese guy friend of mine just started dating another chinese girl. They're adorable!",

    "commentText": "As a white person who's lived in China, how you are treated hugely differs from city to city, and obviously also from person to person. Generally speaking, you have a lot of privilege (positive stereotypes about you), but a lot of Chinese people also tend to think of you as some kind of exotic zoo animal to stare at, take pictures of and touch whenever they feel like it, regardless of whether you protest.\nIt's easier to hitchhike or ask for help as a white person than as someone who looks Asian. According to the Chinese people I've asked about that, that's because they don't think white people would scam them, but they are constantly suspicious of fellow Chinese people. The people in this video are also definitely right that it's easy to get a job as a translator or English teacher, even if your English isn't actually that great, but only if you're white, not some other kind of foreigner. But on the other hand, you can't really get jobs with actual substance, those are reserved for Chinese people. \nAlso, it's hard to get cabs, because cabdrivers are scared of speaking English so they'll avoid you (didiche and uber solve this problem). I've also sometimes been denied service at post offices or food stands because I was white, but that was rare. Sometimes they'll even pretend not to understand what you're saying when you speak Chinese to them (my Chinese level is really not the problem here, because they'd suddenly perfectly understand what I was saying when it was convenient just minutes later). Also, random Chinese people passing by will think you don't speak Mandarin, so they'll say the nastiest things about you while you're standing right next to them. That's also how I know I was denied service specifically because I was not Chinese, they were just like \"‰Ω†ÁúãÔºåÂ§ñÂõΩ‰∫∫ÔºåÊàë‰ª¨Â∏Æ‰ªñ‰ª¨ÂêóÔºü\" \"ÁÆó‰∫ÜÂêß„ÄÇ\"",

Even the successful Elaine L. Chao, her and her sisters' husbands are white, too. \nActually the video picks up too little people to interview. What is happening in China is beyond all of your imagination. It is a trend that in Chinese young people's opinions, some white people come to China because they are just low-life losers who can not find a job in their own countries and come. In addition, some of tourists also don't respect Chinese at all. They always take it granted that we should speak English to them and call our girls \"easy girls\" which generated hatred on internet. I can tell you we mainland Chinese people are more and more confident now. Many white people only love to go to southeast asian countries like Philippine for example because it is highly possible that they will be treated like VIPs.",

Hence tanned skin becomes more desirable.\r\nIn China since ancient time, dark skin tone has been linked to low social status. Cuz only outdoor workers or farmers could get tanned easily. Thus the appreciation of pale skin persists constantly.\r\nIMO everyone is beautiful in their own way.

I‚Äôm black, I grew up in ChinaTown Chicago, my best friends were Hispanic, some of my teachers were Indian, I now live in Texas, where there are quite a few Native Americans, and I lived in the suburbs in white neighborhoods for a while. Therefore, to me, Yellows, Browns, Blacks, Whites, Reds and any color you can think of are gorgeous to me. Of course, there will always be those specific people who are less gorgeous than others in each race, but overall, they‚Äôre all beautiful people.",

In the video, there were a few questions about foreigners, but it mostly had to do with Chinese people‚Äôs view on paler skin tones for their own race. It was interesting to hear about the guy who thought it was better for guys to be darker and girls pale because more athletic means more masculine. To answer the question though, my experience includes other people picking on me and saying I should get out more. I do think in areas that value athleticism like the U.S. everyone tries to go for a sun kissed version of their skin tone. That can be near impossible for really fair skinned people.",

We all knows racial issue's are controversial and sensitive by  nature, With just a little mistakes you make, it could hurt the sentiment of thousands. Honestly, It's more like you're promoting to embraced the white race. Think about the young Asians, by watching this you want them to feel/brainwashed that the whites/caucaciod races are superior than the Asian race? I looked up to this channel, But never expect you would stoop this low? If you do this same experiment to those whites/Caucasian they will never say anything positives about Asian race, except for those few male, who will say Asian woman are submissive, that will be the most positive feedback you'll get from them, I've seen it in other channel. I'm a proud Asian and for me personally i never feel Whites are superior than me, never.\nHave some self esteem, Oh God I'm too ashamed to be an Asian after this.",

While their media's are all about lies, biasness and prejudices towards us, why should we feed them all those praise and positivity?\nInstead of being humble down themselfs for our simplicity and boldness they would rather took advantage over it as our weaknesses and in return it ends up pulling us down to the lowest pit..!",

Asians are seen as smarter, shorter, introverted, excelling in musical art, the list goes on and its honestly ridiculous. I've only ever had 1 asian friend, he was born in the US and his parents were from Tianjin china. Coolest dude you could ever know, parents were almost carefree, and one of the most popular kids in my highschool. (He had an amazing sneaker collection too. Not better than mine, but it was still amazing.)",

I'm so sleepy right now, well whatever~  first of all ,if you know history well as you claimedÔºåthan you should know paper making and gunpowder were high techs in ancient time , and we all know how gunpowder change the human history, and without paper makingÔºå how do westerners spread their knowledge so efficiently  during Renaissance and Reformation? Without success of  those, I don't think the British can open the modern world that soon, talk about Capitalist and Industrial Revolution? No way, at least not that early. Not to say China is the first country  invented modern political system and civil service systemÔºåand things like paper money, don't think using paper money is a easy thing back in 1000 yrs ago, it requires  anti-counterfeiting techniques,„ÄÅbank and high credibility of government. And more inventions but I can't think of  right away\n\nAnd Chinese and Asians innovated and invented a lot of things based on modern industry ,  it just not so revolutionary like car and plane,  just small inventions like LED and OLED, VCD, and some parts of smart phone and car etc, and there are a lot of Chinese American scientist in USA, Nobel Prize winner Chen Ning Yang is Chinese,  but to be honest  it's a fact that most of modern inventions were  invented by whites,   but China has started to modernized only few decades ago , we got a lot of catch up to do, and learn(some say it's copy) from the west,  and I believe that as soon as China reach the same develop level as the West, we will starting to invent and innovate more\n\nPS  the reason  I said ‚Äúthat's not my job to inform you‚Äù   not bcoz I got nothing to say,  first I'm tired, and also due to my terrible english witch I learn from the TV shows, so it's super annoying and exhausting to write a long comment  and still got a lot of things don't know how to express in english, that's why~",

        "commentText": "Gage Cabani \"nothing seriously important or useful compares to white men's math, physic, chemistry, biology, geology, car, plane, steamed ship, computer, internet, phones...\"\n\nMath: Just so you know, ALL of the algebra you ever learned in high school (assuming you made it that far) originated in China before the West had any concept of algebra (not even kidding).  To list a few of China's most precocious innovations in the field: 1) A functionally complete calculus of fractional operations (not to mention symbolic positional decimal notation) by -300, echoes of which can be seen in a recently recovered coordinate multiplication table from Qin.  2) A binomial expansion algorithm for root extraction with a Ruffini-Horner optimisation, first applied to square and cube roots in the -1st century Nine Chapters_, and eventually to polynomials in the Middle Ages.  3) Also in the Nine Chapters, the world's first general solution for systems of linear equations, expressed as a square matrix of coefficients, via an algorithm known to the West as Gaussian elimination (absent in the West before Isaac Newton).  4) As a distillation of operations with systems of linear equations, the world's first functionally complete calculus of negative numbers, including multiplication (sign inversion), by 3rd-century commentator on _Nine Chapters Liu Hui.  5) This one not strictly algebraic, but well-worth considering: the Cartesian coordinate system, plotting dependent variable (virtue) against independent variable (time), this one casually invented by none other than the most educated woman in ancient history, Ban Zhao, in her contribution to the _Hanshu_.\n\nIf this tiny list of Chinese contributions alone doesn't strike you as \"seriously important,\" then you are welcome to shun them for what they are and go back to counting livestock with your fingers...\n\nPhysics: While it makes little sense to speak of physics before Isaac Newton, the classical Micians, 2000 years before Newton, did have an accurate concept of the properties of gravity and its relation to directional force and motion (see Mojing B 26, 27), which is farther than Aristotle got around that time.  They were also the first in recorded history to describe the optics of concave and convex mirrors.\n\nChemistry: this field didn't even exist until about 200 years ago when atomic theory was developed (or ~240 if you start with Antoine Lavoisier's stoichiometry).  Before that, virtually all of Western knowledge about matter was based on alchemy of the Four Elements which basically involved trying to burn everything to see if it turns to gold.  At least the Chinese made good of something with their experiments in the form of *gunpowder*... so that ol' whitey can \"discover\" a new continent by heroically stealing it behind a matchlock from the least fortified peoples on Earth, then go on to call it \"insignificant!\"  SMH\n\nBiology: fair enough, the Chinese really did nothing for this field.  \"TCM\" is an abomination that needs to be wiped out.  But believe it or not, the late Warring States Chinese were the world's first ecological conservationists in their rationale for regulating seasonal hunting and forestry.\n\nGeology: Um... the world's first seismoscope?  Hello!  I thought you were \"very well informed on Chinese history.\"  Anyways, considering how the Chinese invented crop rotation and various practical soil sciences (ridge-furrow planting, anyone?) that define modern agriculture and are a big part of what sustains the Earth's population, I don't see how it could be less important than knowing the difference between a stalactite and a stalagmite...\n\nCar: fossil fuel (-3rd century); helical (chevron) gearing (-2nd century); crank-and-connecting rod reciprocal motion mechanisms (-2nd century; first seen in Han rotary querns, industrial-sized winnowing fans, and floor looms) that underlie the internal combustion engine (and the steering wheel)...  Oh, and as for that steel chassis, um...: blast furnaces and decarburised steel (since Han era).\n\nPlane: kite gliders (-4th century), rotor blades (and rotary sculling fans in general, like winnowing fans, from -2nd century at the latest), hot air balloons (flying lanterns), rocketry.  Can't take off without at least one of these.\n\n\"steamed ship\": Hey genius, try crossing the Atlantic in an 800-foot ship without bulkhead compartments and a rudder... or a compass... or steel, for that matter.  All insignificant things, I'm sure.\n\nComputer: binary arithmetic (as implied by a -2nd-century epigraphic reordering of the Changes (OG text circa -9th century) from Mawangdui).  Of course, you could always go analog /s\n\nWell, it's been a pleasure!  Reply for further discussion on China's intellectual history.  Enjoy your spaceships!",

In every race of humans, even from the darkest black people to the whitest white people, there has always been preference for those who are whiter within a population. The reason is that fair or whiter skin indicates youth and fertility, as skin naturally darkens through ageing and after menopause when women become infertile. Dark skin is also an indicator of skin damage through formation of freckles, age spots and other discolorations. And since East Asians have always had a preference for more youthful looks compared to other races and ethnicities, it is natural that we prefer whiter skin as it relates to the attributes that humans naturally find youthful.",

        "commentText": "And another thing I want to point out, East Asians sometimes wear cosmetic colored lenses and in our manhwa, manhua and manga, the characters have colored hair and eyes because they want to be identifiable and distinct personalities for the reader to relate to. As in comics, characters look very much alike due to the cartoonish artstyle, so coloring of hair and eyes are used to differentiate between characters who would otherwise look alike due to the ambiguity of the design of comic characters if coloring were not used (which in black and white comics, would mean differentiation of characters happening through fashion and hairstyles instead of colored hair or eyes). And this same reason applies to real life when girls wear colored lenses, to show off their individuality as naturally, East Asians all have black hair and dark brown eyes, so wearing colored lenses allows girls to stand out from other girls to draw attention to themselves as girls love attention and being the center of it. So colored lenses are entirely about wanting to be unique, individualistic, receiving attention and standing out from the crowd, NOT because we want to \"be Caucasian\". Western people need to get over their arrogance and stop thinking they are the center of everything.",

There is nothing wrong with having light skin, however we can agree the light skin movement was pushed by whites because before that the black planet was about tribalism never about colourism. How did it come across, well let's use the a book called anthropology genectical fantasy author Charles Darwin in his own words said that history of the whites is that they were in refrigerator box meaning the ice cave and developed a unempathic hatred towards natural things even towards themselves and see a deficiency in themselves outwardly and inwardly and as genetically recessive, and  project the worst of themselves on other people. Due to their environment and lack of civilisation knowledge they would sleep with their dead one's and not but u them, drink blood of each other, steal from each other and lie to each other when a little of bit of food would grow so not a lot of them would eat all of it out. Then when the Africans recused them from their inhabitant abode and taught them how to be civilise. They the whites started having kids with the Africans and slowly adopted their custom and took over their culture, and used their kids as a tool to oppress their African side. Eventually conquered , and used that as an ideology of survival of the fitness, in terms if what the animals do howvebr in his book mentions that whites Don't really believe that in fact they use ancient African knowledge to control world e.g sepiroth knowledge= tree knowledge which they got from ancient Egypt, and nilo valley. That been said developed an alter ego called the other which allows them to justify their evil ways of projecting victim mentality in the act of oppressing blacks. Why because black people r genetically dominant, they age slower,  their organs r built different which is why whites steal them, the black man and woman can repopulate themselves in any other non-black men or women non-blacks can only repopulate themselves in themselves. Blacks r envied also for their historical achievements, remedies maths science physics, architectures, fashion, beauty, style which started with blacks first, prymids how we built as multi stone computer system activate by sound and also a heath care place. Also blacks r envied and hated for their intellectual potential in sports and how over 100% of the invention all nations use that descended from black people was invented by black people and some they did before slavery and some in slavery and after slavery while been oppressed and without going to the same schools as white kids. This is the reason why whites changed and blow off the noses all around the blacks lands why because whites know they r recessive and know that their whole history starts with africans",

You are hard pressed to know the real name of a Chinese person, theyll always use the fake name in the presence of a foreigner. They see the world narrowly as \"Black\" or \"White or \"Yellow\"\" (they actually call themselves that), they dont know of a whole continent named South America and its relation to race. It wont change till they change their education system, which will be never.",

I am not White or Black or Asian.  I am Hispanic and never have wanted to be anything but who I am.  It never crossed my mind.

Like I'm from Ireland a predominantly white country and the amount of girls that buy fake tan is ridiculous but the beauty standard here is having tanned skin like Spain or South American countries. I'm sure if you tell a person in china that girls in Ireland to buy fake tan they will be like why and when you tell irish girls that chinese girls try skin whitening products they will be like wtf aswell. This isn't just skin tone it goes for everything hair colour, eye colour, hair type , facial features, body type. Almost everyone wants something they don't have.",

However, unless you're white with hair that stands out (incredibly long, incredibly wavy/curly, incredibly bright such as platinum blond/red, etc.) a black person will attract WAY more attention for their hair (I have stories for DAYS about random Chinese people coming up and grabbing my hair).\nWhite is right, most definitely. Anyone who tells you differently is lying. Just go to any super market and look at how almost all the beauty products have \"meibai\" or whitening in them. Look at all the people wearing long sleeves or carrying an umbrella on a sunny cloudless day.  Ask most black English teachers about their job hunt vs. a white English teacher (some ads even explicitly say no black people). Ask a Chinese person about their stereotypes of white people vs. black people. If they're being honest, the ones about black people are way more negative (we're lazy, drug dealers/users, dirty, violent, etc.).\nThrough all of it, they'll say they aren't racist though (because in China there aren't people from other races, so how can they be racist? <-- This was said to me, a black person, living in China, I obviously didn't exist. lol)\nI will say though, the origin of preference for white skin is because it used to be that the only pale people were rich, as everyone else had to work in agriculture under the hot sun. It started out as more of a status/wealth origin than preference for one race over another. HOWEVER, it has now moved into a preference for Eurocentric things and the media has played a big part in that.",

Clean, symmetrical features, clean looking hair and hair color and especially eye colors etc. The issue is, we tend to relate colors and textures with other stuff. Brown or black skin is usually likened to dirt, feces or decay/rot. It's horrible to think that way but humans have a relational imagery to something. As a tall white guy with brown hair and bright blue eyes who's been called very attractive in both the States and my time in China, SKorea, Japan and even Guam, when I was in Suzhou, I was fawned over by the Women there. The attention was ridiculous at times.\n\nThe odd thing is, it wasn't just Asia, the attention was also in various parts of Africa when I was doing Humanitarian Aid when I PCA'd on heavies for two years (USAF). being as polite and personable didn't help as I was a magnet for guys and girls which is something I don't have to contend with as much in the US.",

I have been living in China for quite some time, specifically Suzhou which is about 30 mins from Shanghai by fast train, if I am not mistaken its the 10th largest city in China. There is a large expat community here, majority of the expats are white which is why as a woman of color I get more stares and pictures taken of me than my white counterparts. But the level of privilege that you have as a white person in China is well known (job prospects/opportunities), white people here acknowledge as well because it is so blatant. I've seen it within my own place of employment, because Chinese parents prefer their kids to be taught by white teachers, because they feel it their child would be more cultured and poised. Its disheartening but you cant let it hold you back from the strength and positivity that manifests within you. There are always going to be disadvantages wherever you go, but its how you respond to them. You can open up a dialogue about it, keep quiet, or move on to something else.",

Asian can go from pale, very light, light beige, darker beige, light with hint of pink, or hint of orange, and tanned. Then South Asia brown, dark brown, but some very pale depending on the region. But Caucasians just call us Yellow and never knew that historically there were always certain class of people, namely upper class people who had very light complexions.

If the majority of the people have a tendency to tan and not because they are lower class but because they have melanin how can that be made a slight on the majority of East Asians? Like if people that are Asian are so smart. Why is it that they don't know this or respect the color that naturally exist within them? Smh. Unfortunately, this desire to achieve \"brightness\" physically is happening all over the world of colored peoples. It is very sad when you don't appreciate the skin color that protects and gives you the ability to not age so quickly and all of the other great benefits that has been gifted to POC's.

That's totally different stuff. It is nothing to do with Caucasian one. If you have a better undetstanding of the imperial concubine Yang and classic poems to describe her stunning beauty,  such as Ê∏©Ê≥âÊ∞¥ÊªëÊ¥óÂáùËÑÇ, ÂõûÁú∏‰∏ÄÁ¨ëÁôæÂ™öÁîü, ÂÖ≠ÂÆ´Á≤âÈªõÊó†È¢úËâ≤, ËäôËìâÂ¶ÇÈù¢Êü≥Â¶ÇÁúâ, Ê¢®Ëä±‰∏ÄÊûùÊò•Â∏¶Èõ®, ‰∫ëÊÉ≥Ë°£Ë£≥Ëä±ÊÉ≥ÂÆπ,Êò•È£éÊãÇÊßõÈú≤ÂçéÊµì,‰∏ÄÊûùÁ∫¢Ëâ≥Èú≤ÂáùÈ¶ô, ‰∫ëÈõ®ÈõæÂ±±ÊûâÊñ≠ËÇ†.

Actually in many small cities and rural areas, veteran citizens still think Caucasian are far from good-looking, they think Caucasian are ppl with ÁãêËá≠, body odor smells badly, Êâ£ÁúâÊ¥ºÁúº, Â•≥‰∫∫Áî∑Áõ∏ÔºåÁî∑‰∫∫ÈáéÁõ∏, some ppl even call Caucasian È¨º‰Ω¨, literally means ghost or devil. Chinese ppl have strong cultural confindence, you could call them ËúúÊ±ÅËá™‰ø°, mysterious self-love, it's preinstalled in everyone's mind, China must and should be the best forever. My opinion is beauty standard is just the thing like cutting edge technology, we must have our own rule, just like Hollywood, which is important to national image. After all, Caucasian and any races people include Chinese ppl will look down upon a self-hate nation. That's it. Leave your guidance, if you wish",

Second of all, I don't really want to be educated on a subjective matter such as \"what is true beauty\", that is just ridiculous. Lastly,  from what I can tell you mean pale skinned not grey skinned. Please look up that kind of stuff before posting. In western culture that is such a demeaning and racist thing to say. You keep saying that you don't want to offend anyone yet you use the phrase \"lifeless grey skin\". How could the content of the video ever justify such a statement?

Just another window for your understanding of the world. No racism in China, Almost 100% Chinese are the same race. No concept of racial discrimination inter-China. Somebody believe nationalism and populism, just like Westerners, but government oppress any kind of nationalism prevent China into countries like Nazi-Germany and former Soviet Union. You shouldnot just want to listen words what you willing to listen, the objective fact is not transferred to the will of human beings. You just want to listen ppl praise that you Caucasians are with good skin and deny the fact East Asian are those who have better skin. I can applogise for my misusing adjective to describe what Caucasian's skin looks like. For better understanding, I suppose you take the Chinese sentences as standard, ignore the English version. And you must realize that Chinese have its own rule define fair skin and almost social science. You have any doubts and thoughts even angers towards this issue means I finally achieve my goal, help ppl understand different concept about Chinese fair skin and Caucasian one. After all, Marco Polo envied rich wealth of ancient China and China's fair skin. If possible, you can help me modify my English version sentence, a better communition, help ppl view the world with dialectical point of views.",

For example, I grew up in the UK, have a British accent and have received all of my qualifications according to the British education system. However, I have repeatedly been rejected by schools of good standing and some affiliated with famous universities in China because I look too Chinese. Many have admitted to me that they still prefer white people to teach their students English, even though they know that I am FAR MORE QUALIFIED and their English is not that good. Asians should stick together and combat the stereotype that 'white people are better.' If not, we would always be ruled by 'white privilege.'",

But because i am always in the sun, my skin gets darker, and i dont really mind getting darker because i am outside.\n\nBut since i'm outside a lot, my skin gets rough and i get scratches and scrapes, etc. So in comparison to mine, (in general) caucasian skin is smoother and softer.\n\nAnd i'm asian. So if there was a reason for me to want to have caucasian skin, it would be because I like the texture, and doesnt necessarily have anything to do with colour",

Bright isn't about color/race but about texture, evenness and the radiance in their skin which I think is so important to take care of. Hopefully Asians and Africans will stop using bleaching (brightening I think is ok?) products since this lead to skin cancer. So scary :(",

But just before she turned 30, man.... wrinkles started forming, hair started going white, and a few of her back teeth fell out, now at age 36 she looks like a 50 year old. She doesn‚Äôt smoke or do any illicit drugs. She exercises and flosses and takes really good care of herself... It‚Äôs so sad. I had another friend in school she was in her mid 20‚Äôs smoked and looked like a 45 year old... when she told me she was 26 I didn‚Äôt believe her until I saw her drivers license. I have a guy friend, age 27 head of white hair, white beard. I thought he was an old man until I saw his high school and college diplomas.",

We have no allies except for a few POC fighting for the same cause. \n\nEven when they do mean it, it's usually in a fetishy way or they only like the Asians who fit the Euro beauty standard.

You realize Blacks are better at athletics while Asians have a higher IQ? How do you even process that with your \"all races are equal\" narrative? If you think all races are equally attractive, that is your unique opinion, but when you quantify attractiveness in terms of facial symmetry, jaw structure, eye shape, et cetera, Whites are, on average, objectively more attractive than other races. It is actually because Asians weren't brainwashed into thinking that all races are exactly the same as you were that they acknowledge this. Here, consider this, Whites have more attractive faces, but Blacks definitely have more attractive bodies on average, the men have larger penises and higher amounts of skeletal muscle mass, while the females have larger buttocks, though Whites do tend to have larger breasts. We are all different and unequal and those differences correlate on average with race, it's called diversity and it is a beautiful thing.",

We are also used to speaking our mind (mostly) or expecting equality and not subscribing to hierarchy. The boss is equal to the employee. I am not sure, but from what I've seen that Chinese are not used to this when it comes to hierarchy in the office?

I'm European and not all Europeans look the same. the skin tone of Italians, Portugese, Spanish and Greeks is very different then those of Swedish, Danes, Finns, Polish and Russians. the Greeks, Portugese, Italians and Spanish have a more olive oil skin colour. more tanned because of the Mediterranean Sea region/location. \nnot all Europeans are completely snow white people from Scandinavia. lol\n\njust look at Cristiano Ronaldo(olive oil skin colour because he is Portugese) to David Beckham(a white Englishman with blonde hair and blue eyes).\n\nyou won't find that many pale white skin, blonde hair, blue eyes Portugese in Portugal. lol\nalmost all of the Portugese are olive oil skinned.",

I'd say the majority is more tanned than white tbh. People are usually born light skinned or way lighter than the colour they are when they're older because they've been in the womb for so long! When I was a baby I was practically white but I am tan now because my mum and dad are. No one is actually as fair as they were when they were a baby naturally unless their parents are that colour. Also for OP,  Italians and Greeks are still considered white. Just because you're tanned doesn't mean you're not white, just like how Indian people have varying skin tones but are still considered brown.",

YOU ALL KNOW GOOD AND WELL that when someone says you are black, white, yellow, red, or brown that they are NOT talking exclusively about skin color. Who would have thought that anyone would have to clarify that? It boggles the mind that people think in such literal terms, when LITERALLY - you have seen crayons and you know that no one's skin (or very few people) is actually WHITE, BLACK, YELLOW, or RED. Give me a freakin break. THOSE ARE POLITICAL (not LITERAL) TERMS designed create general, cultural, social blocks to put people in. Who needs to be told that we are ALL shades of BROWN? Like, really??! And these are probably terms more accepted, understood, and propagted in the west - specifically in America - where our history and ethos and culture and society and institutions and laws and families and economies have been founded on these types of divisions. It is understood that WHITE people, around the globe are Europeans - period. It is understood that BLACK people around the globe are of African descent - period. It is understood that YELLOW people around the globe are East Asians - period. It is understood that RED people around the globe are Native/Indigenous. It is understood that BROWN people around the globe are South Asians, I guess.... although brown identification is also a catchall/mutt identification as mixed race blacks, latinos, and Middle Eastern people all fall into that category, too. So now we can be clear that the actual color is a representation of a group of people and does not, necessarily, mean the color of the person. White people are known colloquially as RED NECKS -  their skin is more pinkish/redish/orangey but we still call them \"white.\" Back people range VASTLY in color from high yellow to dark brown, but we still call ourselves \"black\" - and it's because these are convenient and easy ways to identify groups/regions/races/nations of people. A simplified code, if you will.",

People look past the fact white people often want to be more tanned and would go to solariums or get spray tans. I was self conscious of my pale skin growing up and would try and get some sun so I could tan. This can cause skin cancer and ages skin. Should I blame this on darker skinned people or is just because it‚Äôs something we ourselves as a culture came to think is more attractive for our own reasons. Why can it not be the same for asians. Just as the original commenter said people value different things and there are a lot of things I would value in the appearance of a white person that are commonly found in Asian peoples appearance and I find attractive. The same goes for Asian people. There are attributes asians appreciate amongst themselves that just so happen to be commonly found in other races. They only talked about white people in this video but I have heard asians appreciating the facial features of middle eastern, Italian, Brazilian and many other ethnicities too.",

I have Asian friends who obsess about their eyelids and I‚Äôm just saying from a Western perspective which doesn‚Äôt have a narrow definition of beauty, all shapes are attractive.

People will do what they will do and a few online arguments aren't likely to change them. Just glad I was able to present my perspective and let anyone who might be reading this judge for themselves. I trust any half intelligent person can see thru your arguments. \n\nJust a last word about beauty standards. I didn't say Western stds aren't broader. What I meant was, they're not as broad as you claim. The Western world still has limited notions of beauty that they're only recently starting to change. For the most part Asians are still ridiculed as ugly and berated for their looks. The Talks Julie Chen was pressured to take plastic surgery in order to advance her career. \nWhen people make comments like the one you made, it's usually in the spirit us vs them. Us, the inherently progressive West, vs these 3rd worlders lacking the ability to question what's been passed down to them. They don't recognize that East and West exist on a spectrum. We're all moving in the same direction except some are further along than others. \n\nWith regards to Asian beauty standards, it doesn't do to generalize. I understand S. Korea has a very narrow definition. I'm not sure about China. Amongst the Asians I know, the beauty standard isn't really that strictly defined.",

EAs are seen as beautiful while the rest of Asia is seen as dirty and ugly. Not only that, but they are the most privilege group of asians (and as pocs) in and out of Asia. They are seen as the \"cool asians\" and didn't have to face decades of colonialism like other Asian countries. So many people are obsessed with your facial features and culture. Lots of people wish to be East Asian, but never to be any other Asian because they are seen as unattractive.\n\n EAs get treated the best idk why EAs are always living in a bubble and are so ignorant to this. Your from China and clearly don't know how the dynamic works in Western countries. Other Asian groups face lots of racial discrimination for  their skin color. In no way whats so ever are they seen as a beauty standard. East Asians are treated much better then any other Asian group in the West. To assume that skin tone isn't a factor is VERY ignorant and show how privileged you East Asians are. Just as white people do, you East Asians look down on the other asians groups. You guys are always so oblivious to your privileges over other asians and pocs.",

The preference for light skin might not have had a racial origin but it certainly translates into race now. In our globalized world, the current beauty std affects how we see black, white and brown people and ourselves in comparison to them.\n\nI agree with your second paragraph though. The high regard for whites is partly a result of their economic status. It's not because of their race. White ppls economic status is the result of centuries of European colonization which has created a global structure with them at the top. This is called white privilege and it's why they're treated better wherever they go. It's not because the locals worship them, it's because more often than not, white people are at a position of advantage. Ppl often mistake white privilege for white worship, especially when it comes to E&SE Asians because E&SE Asians are already stereotyped as weak.",

While less so for men (muscles and the general position of facial features seems to be more important when we judge a man's appearance)\nBack in the Tang dynasty, the Huji, basically Iranian fair-skinned women, were very popular among the elite men of the empires.\nI say it is not out of a self-loathing attitude, because there are very fair-skinned men/women among Asians, too. Dark skin tends to be related with heavy manual labour (because of the sun glares), which implies lower social status.",

What I meant to say was that a lot of my Chinese friends are obsessed with white people and white skin and white facial features. This is not just my particular group of friends, but a pervasive feeling among a large fraction of china's youth - this has been studied at an academic level and a few theories have emerged as to why this is, mostly relating to the Cultural Revolution and the pre-1980s period where China was pretty much isolated from the rest of the world (in short, they say that Chinese were 'dazzled' by the western world once they learned about it, and this went as far as influencing people's beauty standards to try to match western beauty). This lady seems not only completely immune to those cultural constraints, but she's radiant, smiling, confident and has good advice to give. That's all.",

Asian men are systematically discriminated against for their race and gender yet no one cares because they still work the hardest and make the most money despite the blatant discrimination. Look at the media. I wouldn't care if Asian men weren't portrayed at all in the media, yet they do, only to portray Asian males in such a negative light. Short, nerdy, weak, emasculate. That stereotype has been pushed for decades in Western media even though I know plenty of Asian men who are over 6 feet tall, buff, masculine, and can pull girls of all races. When I was in high school, my white friend wanted to introduce me to a white girl but she declined and her reason was because I was Asian. A week later, she saw me at a football game and wanted our mutual friend to introduce me to her. See? Her perception of me was perpetuated by media yet she didn't even know what I looked like. After seeing what I looked like, she wanted to meet me.",

In case of future are they East Asian people at the first place who are worried about rising power of China. Nobody knows how it will develop.",

In the ancient times people with less education had to work outside. So their skin were tanned. And because those people were poor, and were relatively uneducated, Chinese related tanned skin to poor and uneducated class of people within OUR society. I think any sensible and educated Chinese will not regard common White men or Women handsome or pretty. We understand fully that likes of George Cloony and Rooney Mara can be found only in Hollywood but outside of it? We look so much better than them. Lol. We are not envious of whiteness with that of Caucasian, that is for sure. It is not gonna happen. Caucasians thinks too highly of themselves. Lol.",

Long answer:  There was an unspecified meeting among Youtube types & they said that notifications were no longer going to go out to everyone, but only to the channel's bigger or best fans.  They did not expound on that definition or the qualifications.  They apparently have made a change when you sub to a new channel.  You can choose to always be notified or occasionally notified.  But to be on the safe side, make sure your notification bell has the marks on the top right & left side of the bell which indicates 'always'",
