The evolution of patience and persistence will triumph over our infantile human arrogance. Michio Kaku is his own worst enemy in his inability to recognise and contain his egocentrically flawed, self gratifying hypothesis. Keep your eyes, ears and mind as open as your desire for the truth. Time is the most valuable of all currencies. Spend it wisely. When you are far enough \"advanced\" take a closer look at Neutrinos.  You are welcome. (enjoy your Nobel Prize)",

            "commentText": "I feel compelled to be devil's advocate here. In the 1940s, a lowly graduate student observed the antagonistic effects of microorganisms in the soil. Day and night for weeks and months, Albert Schatz grew and observed microbes isolated from the soil in the search for potentially useful antibiotics. Once he observed a promising result, he worked painstakingly to isolate and test the effectiveness of this antibiotic. He told his supervisor (Selman Waksman), who promptly took care to pocket the royalties, public recognition and also the Nobel Prize. Waksman traveled all over the place to present 'his' work. Listen to the description of Jocelyn Bell's work in the video, and you will find both cases eerily similar. But, of course, Schatz's stolen work is not possibly a case of <b> sexism.</b> But if his story had been unchanged except for his<b>  gender</b>, it would almost certainly stand as a modern example o<b> f sexis</b>m. I am not saying th<b> at sexi</b>sm wasn't prevalent during the time the video and I have described, but let's just hold on to our horses first, and analyse each case by its merits. Often, scientists are just too eager for credit, and loose sight of fairness in the process.\n\nI hope this comment doesn't get lost amongst the thousands of others. If you found this comment reasonable, please upvote it. (That sounded a lot more pedantic than I hoped... I;'m just really passionate about the history of science and especially the rise of modern medicine)\u00a0\n\nPS read\u00a0Experiment Eleven: Deceit and Betrayal in the Discovery of the Cure for Tuberculosis by Peter Pringle for details on the Schatz story. It's an easy read and gives insight into the student supervisor dynamics of the time.",

It seems to me like the<b>  sexism</b> is the other way around if the yardstick o<b> f sexis</b>m in science is how much<b>  a s</b>ex suffers for being ridiculed. But I do not believe this story about the genius female who was ridiculed because she was female. It sounds too much like feminist propaganda, too artificial, too convenient to the ideologically driven in order to be true. At worse she was ridiculed because her ideas seemed outrageous, no other reason. Now in the academia people are afraid to call the ridiculous ideas o<b> f a wo</b>man ridiculous because then they get in trouble with the politically corect establishement. The same with blacks and other protected groups that cannot be touched, criticised, even looked at in a way that can be construed funny. How many more billions of dollars have to be wasted, how many really talented male scientists will have to be discarded before the obvious, the reasonable, the factual will be recognized, namely that women cannot do science.",

Response to Stimuli; simple or complex actions in response\n to environment. Adaptation would fit under this topic as well. \n5.

In an after-dinner speech made in 1977, she had the following to say on the matter:\n\nThere are several comments that I would like to make on this: First, demarcation disputes between supervisor and student are always difficult, probably impossible to resolve. Secondly, it is the supervisor who has the final responsibility for the success or failure of the project. We hear of cases where a supervisor blames his student for a failure, but we know that it is largely the fault of the supervisor. It seems only fair to me that he should benefit from the successes, too. Thirdly, I believe it would demean Nobel Prizes if they were awarded to research students, except in very exceptional cases, and I do not believe this is one of them. Finally, I am not myself upset about it -- after all, I am in good company, am I not! [31]",

The alternative theory of MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) has little support in the community. Rubin, however, prefers the MOND approach, stating \"If I could have my pick, I would like to learn that Newton's laws must be modified in order to correctly describe gravitational interactions at large distances.

It spawned when we realized there simply wasn't enough gravity in the universe to hold galaxies together, and we predicted those galaxies were held together with <b> black </b>holes.\n\nJust look at all the problems we've had with<b>  black</b> holes, especially lately. We know next t<b> o nothin</b>g about them. It seems every year the idea of<b>  a bla</b>ck whole is fizzling apart. Isn't it far more likely that we vastly misunderstand gravi<b> ty, bl</b>ack holes, and the forces? Instead we create this force that is completely undetectable, that we <b> know not</b>hing about, and governs all the problems of the universe that we don't understand. It reminds me a lot of the debate when light was discovered to travel in a vacuum and many people thought there was an \"ether\" that made up most of space to allow electromagnetic waves to travel.\n\nI'm no physicist. I'm a random self educated physics enthusiast, but something just doesn't add up.",

The alternative theory of MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) has little support in the community. Rubin, however, prefers the MOND approach, stating \"If I could have my pick, I would like to learn that Newton's laws must be modified in order to correctly describe gravitational interactions at large distances. That's more appealing than a universe filled with a new kind of sub-nuclear particle.\"[14]",

She never publicly criticized the Nobel prize committee decision. In fact, in 1977 she said: There are several comments that I would like to make on this: First, demarcation disputes between supervisor and student are always difficult, probably impossible to resolve. Secondly, it is the supervisor who has the final responsibility for the success or failure of the project. We hear of cases where a supervisor blames his student for a failure, but we know that it is largely the fault of the supervisor. It seems only fair to me that he should benefit from the successes, too. Thirdly, I believe it would demean Nobel Prizes if they were awarded to research students, except in very exceptional cases, and I do not believe this is one of them. Finally, I am not myself upset about it -- after all, I am in good company, am I not!",

It is understandable though that at the time women were not recognised as equals in work in general, so why science would have been the exception? I don't think that nowadays the same practice would be carried on as in a world where scientific team work is appreciated over an individual's genius mind, it is a lot harder to steal all the fame for a discovery.",

Humans have a thing called \"Same group preference\"\u00a0\n\nStudies have shown that if you take a white test subject and test his preference for a bunch of other subjects. He will show preference for whites over blacks. A <b> black </b>subject will show the same preference for blacks.\n\nYou can even take a bunch of white subjects, and put a \"Blue Team\" shirt on \u00a0half, and a <b> \"Re<b> d</b</b>> Team\" shirt on the other half. and blue team members will prefer their own team.\n\nThis is same group preference. HOWEVER. While females show a very strong same group preference. Males do not as a group. If you make two teams \"Men's Team\" and \"Women's Team\" and tell both a man and<b>  a wom</b>an to choose things. They will show preference for females. almost 100% of the time.\u00a0\n\nFemales are the preferred group across the board. This is why I thi<b> nk \"Patriar</b>chy\" falls flat, because for their to b<b> e a \"Patria</b>rchy\" you have to believe that if you take 100 people, 90 are women and 10 are men. then you say that those 10 are in charge and make ALL the rules. You have to believe that they would turn the 90 women into slaves to do their bidding.\n\nHistory shows this is not the case. Feminists try to compare female rights histo<b> ry to </b>black rights history. \u00a0I am sorry but there was never a \"Blacks and Children first\" policy.",

We are Discussing Michio Kaku and the <b> \"Sexism</b>\" he experiences at work.\n\nSecondly I think you need to research slavery, because what women experience, EVEN in Muslim countries. while horrendous in many cases. is NOT slavery. Please research what slavery is. As I find it deeply and horribly offensive that you would claim women have been slaves for all recorded history. Anyone with a grade school education in History knows slavery involves chains, backbreaking work, and the murder of those who try to escape.\n\nEven i<b> n blac</b>k slavery of the united states, there were laws protecti<b> ng bla</b>ck women from physical abuse, murder, and rape. Yes sociopaths and horrible people did do terrible things<b>  to bl</b>ack women, including but not limited to raping and killing them.\u00a0\n\nJust consider the logistics of a legislature which consider<b> ed a </b>race of people property, that they had no more rights than cattle, literally. Where you could beat them, chop of the front part of their feet, whip them until death, and hang them for the smallest transgression...Consider the logistics of that legislature making laws to protect only the female half from such abuses. It does not matter that the penalty for breaking these laws was a minor fine and a stern talking to. The men were not offered even that protection.\n\nwomen have been a privileged class in \"Almost\" every civilization in recorded history. I include current day Muslim nations in the \"Privileged\" class.\u00a0\n\nGive me any examples you have of women having it worse than men. and I will cede the argument to you. If however I can prove that the men in that same area have it worse, well then we will let that have its own implications.",

Among those who can afford a good education however what I say may still come to pass. I guess we'll see with time. For now we disagree.",

There is also evidence that man weren't hunting as often as we would like think. Hunting was an arduous task and you weren't always lucky with the big game. It's very possible that nets were made and repaired by the women to catch small game. The domestication of wild plants has also been attributed to women while men were probably responsible for the domestication of animals.",

Gravitational orbitals with variable geometries would allow for higher-order bonds between large-scale structures without the need for additional mass.  While dark matter is a sound theory today, it could go the way of phlogiston tomorrow.  Understanding of dark matter and energy are still in their infancy, so a turnaround is still possible.",

When the whole thing starts to stink to the heavens and (4 years now) there are actually no resaults they made up some shit like the neutrino which travels faster than light. I bet my ass off that this is BS. I hope i am wrong tho",
