Where\u2019s it going to stop? This is political correctness going too far.', 'Karen, Sue Knight and Samanaha Hearn were the first TV darts walk-on girls in 1994. Karen stressed that glamour is part of the entertainment business.', 'She added: Every girl who has done it has absolutely loved it. They are not intimidated, they are respected and choose what they want to wear.', 'This is taking a woman\u2019s choice away from her. We don\u2019t interfere with anyone else\u2019s job, so why are they interfering in ours?', 'Hottest walk on girls at the darts', 'After the darts ban was announced this week, Jade Slusarczyk, 32, a walk-on girl for seven years, said: Some people say having walk-on girls is demeaning or degrading but I do not feel degraded at all. I don\u2019t wear skimpy outfits, I wear classy, knee-length dresses.', 'I have never been made to feel uncomfortable and there\u2019s never been anything untoward. It\u2019s like a big sporting family.', 'The Professional Darts Corporation said: \u201cWe regularly review all aspects of our events. This move has been made following feedback from our host broadcasters.', 'Meanwhile several grid girls have criticised Formula One\u2019s decision to also abolish their role in the sport.', 'Model Rebecca Cooper tweeted: \u201cRidiculous that women who say they are \u2018fighting for women\u2019s rights\u2019 are saying what others should and shouldn\u2019t do.', 'Stopping us from doing a job we love.Political correctness gone mad.', 'Sean Bratches, F1\u2019 s American commercial chief, said: Over the last year we have looked at a number of areas we felt needed updating', 'The practice of employing grid girls has been a staple of Formula One Grand Prix for decades. But we feel this custom does not resonate with our brand values.', 'Three-time world champion Sir Jackie Stewart, 78, admitted: These are different times we are living in.'",

If they really cared about \"wimmin''s rights\", they'd spend their time campaigning against FGM, honour killings and forced marriage, not putting other women out of work.  I suppose we'd better brace ourselves for more howls of outrage and sanctimonious lectures from offended feminazis when they catch sight of cheerleaders at the US Superbowl !!!",

Shown photos of strangers, even babies look longer at the faces adults rank the best-looking. For similar reasons, many still thrill to the centuries-old bust of Nefertiti, the Venus de Milo, and the exquisite faces painted by Leonardo and Botticelli. Greta Garbo\u2019s acting style seems stilted today, but her face transcends time. We know beauty when we see it, and our reactions are proven as remarkably consistent. So,we must be careful to understand that seeing beauty is not just a social construct to be changed but also a natural one .....and given that we can appreciate beauty simply for beauties sake as illustrated above ... I say let them continue. I feel aggrieved that other people can so easily destroy our own appreciation of beauty to fit some sordid or warped political agenda. They can use the remote control to turn it off....<b> nobody </b>forces them to watch and let the rest of us appreciate what our brains tell us we should appreciate.

On the one hand we have we have movie stars, models, music artists, celebrities and glamour girls flaunting the raunchiest, sexually explicit outfits at every opportunity by choice. It is their livelihood and often brings in gazillions of dollars. On the other, many of the same women are now objecting to women being sexualised and viewed as objects based solely on their physical attributes.  I have often found the treatment of women based on how young, beautiful and scantily clad they are degrading and sometimes quite offensive. The worrying thing is the target <b> age </b>for much of this media hype is getting younger. For young girls it is especially difficult and not surprising now they have problems with self esteem, self harming, eating disorders and so on. But, women are perpetuating this themselves and are doing it by choice of career which you can't argue with. But, it seems that it is impossible to have it both ways!",

My point of view is that 'Grid-girls' and 'walk-on girls' seem anachronistic in this day and <b> age.</b> Presumably they choose to go into the job and do not feel demeaned by it, though of course we don't all have choices in what we do in life. However it seems to me that to have your purpose simply to be standing looking pretty while holding a banner or a trophy or whatever, reduces that<b>  woman</b> to one single aspect of her humanity - her prettiness, thus objectifying her. This is literally de-grading her, and by extension, all women. Condoning this communicates that we as a society accept that this is a reasonable way to view <b> a woma</b>n. Film stars and musicians do at least present multiple facets of their humanity and are fulfilling roles other than simply looking pretty, so perhaps in this way they are different.  I think that societies make small incremental steps towards being more progressive, and it feels to me that at this point in time, most of our society no longer accepts the idea of<b>  a wom</b>an 's sole purpose in a job being to look pretty/glamorous. I have two daughters, one a 14 y<b> ear </b>old who finds it incomprehensible that ' grid - girl ' is even, as she says \"a thing\". I am pleased that she took it for granted that women would be valued for more than their appearance.",
