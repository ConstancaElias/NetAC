        "postText": "A Labour MP will be spoken to by the chief whip after he told parents protesting against teaching children about LGBT at a Birmingham primary school \u2018you\u2019re right\u2019.', 'Roger Godsiff, who also told campaigners they had a \u2018just cause\u2019 and he would \u2018continue to fight their corner\u2019, will be \u2018reminded of his responsibilities as an MP\u2019, a spokesperson for the party said.', 'Godsiff, MP for the city\u2019s Hall Green constituency which is home to Anderton Park Primary School, was filmed criticising the school\u2019s headteacher.', 'Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said she has reported the \u2018discriminatory and irresponsible\u2019 comments to chief whip Nick Brown.', 'The LGBT Labour group called for the veteran MP to lose the Labour whip.', 'Weeks of megaphone-led protests at the school saw the council successfully apply for a High Court interim injunction, which banned demonstrations outside the gates for the first time on Friday.', 'Protesters object to the school\u2019s use of particular relationship education materials, claiming the teaching is \u2018over-emphasising a gay ethos\u2019.', '', 'Protesters have repeatedly referenced the use of two books; one about two male penguins who raise an egg, and another about a boy who wears a dress.', 'The school\u2019s headteacher Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson has called the demonstrations \u2018toxic and nasty\u2019, and said she has received threats since they started.', 'The police were also called in three weeks ago, after counter-demonstrators were egged.', 'Godsiff first waded into the row last month, saying he understood some parents\u2019 concerns about how \u2018age-appropriate\u2019 elements of the LGBT teaching had been for children aged four and five.', 'Hewitt-Clarkson responded by saying the Equality Act was a \u2018mark in the sand\u2019 and all public servants including Godsiff have a responsibility to \u2018promote, understand and aspire\u2019 to it.', 'In his latest comments, appearing in a video widely circulated on social media, Godsiff said: \u2018I believe in telling it as I see it.\u2019', 'Flanked by the main organiser of the protests, Shakeel Afsar, the MP then said: \u2018If I had the opportunity of rolling the clock back I would do exactly the same thing again.', '\u2018Because I think you have a just cause and I regret the fact that it hasn\u2019t been reciprocated by the headteacher.\u2019', 'Mr Godsiff then asked demonstrators to \u2018consider calling the protest off\u2019 as he said they have made their point, but he added it would be their choice whether to do so.', 'He then said: \u2018I will continue to try and fight your corner because you\u2019re right. Nothing more, nothing less. You\u2019re right.', '\u2018I will continue to try and work to bring a resolution to this dispute but also to ensure that the school teaches the Equality Act in the same way it is being taught at all the other primary schools \u2013 where there isn\u2019t a row.\u2019', 'Rayner, who was in Birmingham on Saturday with party leader Jeremy Corbyn, said: \u2018I\u2019ve reported this to our chief whip.', '\u2018This might be the personal views of Mr Roger Godsiff but they do not represent the Labour Party and are discriminatory and irresponsible.\u2019', 'Meanwhile Wes Streeting, Labour MP for Ilford North, said he would be tabling a formal complaint to the party about Godsiff.', 'In a series of tweets, he said: \u2018This made me feel sick to my stomach.', '\u2018One of my own Labour colleagues stood with people who have peddled hatred and bigotry on school gates, intimidating pupils, teachers and parents.', '\u2018If he was a Tory MP, we\u2019d be all over it.', '\u2018There must be no place for hatred and apologists for hatred in the Labour Party.\u2019', 'At its annual general meeting, the LGBT Labour group voted to condemn Godsiff\u2019s remarks and called for the Labour whip to be removed.', 'The group said on Twitter: \u2018No Labour MP should be pandering to the bigotry we have seen outside the school gates in Birmingham.\u2019', 'Leading Labour councillors from Birmingham City Council also rounded on Godsiff.', 'Deputy council leader Brigid Jones tweeted: \u2018How dare you tell men whose homophobic protests were so threatening and disruptive that they had a court injunction issued against them that they are \u201cright\u201d.', '\u2018You do not speak for me.\u2019', 'A petition calling on the constituency Labour Party to deselect Godsiff following his latest comments has gained 1,000 signatures.', 'This comes as an investigation has been launched after a vicar branded LGBT teaching \u2018state sponsored child abuse\u2019.', 'Rector The Rev Peter Hughes claimed teaching kids about gay and trans relationships was \u2018a form of child grooming\u2019 that \u2018opens the door for sexual predators\u2019.', 'The priest, who is a governor of a Church of England Primary School, could now face the sack over his remarks.', 'He even claimed a seven year old girl had been reduced to tears when she asked her parents: \u2018Mummy, am I a boy or a girl? My teacher says I can choose.\u2019', 'He added: \u2018THE RSE programme is a form of child grooming\u2026 This sexual indoctrination of young children prepares them for early sexual experimentation, normalises it and, in so doing, opens the door for sexual predators.\u2019",
