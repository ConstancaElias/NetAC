We do this for a number of reasons. The main one being that we don't want our financial assets stolen by some superficial bitch in marriage. They can just divorce us and since the court is rigged against men, they will nearly always get a lot of money from it, to put it simply. We don't want to be a part of this. Most men are a lot happier mgtow, as they don't have to waste their money on a wife that will probably not respect him, cheat and take the kids.",

    "commentText": "Reply to BRAINWASHED Eva Bukhryakova: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LquIQisaZFU Dangerous People Are Teaching Your Kids\nTravis Thacker11 months ago\nYea that works if you can get the majority on your side and the other children are smart also.  I got pretty much thrown in the special corner in school for doing things like that. No one would support me even when I could prove the Teachers lesson wrong by providing proof or other related materials that showed they had altered or skewed a test or series of tests so that certain students had a higher % chance of making a better grade.  Yea i got suspended for that one.   I had collected data for 4 weeks my 2nd year of HS all to prove a Female Teacher was being bias toward the male students by not providing them with the proper learning material all while giving the females in the class access to her personal laptop and internet related learning material directly related to the project we were working on.   I just got told there was nothing the Principal or board could do cause her family was big shit in our little town and that they knew she was holding back the male students in her classes so the females had a better chance at getting the scholarships awarded at the end of the term for that grade.  Her daughter was only 2 years behind me in grades but had friends in the same grade as I was and a cousin so the Bitch did her best to ensure the cousin and her friends always got first access to any internet time back then in the 90's which made a huge deal in research related material.  \n  This bias shit has gone on so long it's not even funny and all it ever does is change from one sex to the other and from one race to the other depending on which race or sex is a bigger help to the political parties at the time.  That or whatever relatives they have matters more then anything else also. It's nothing more then human survival trying to ensure the better chance for there kin and genetics through red tape and other underhanded tricks used to weed out new comers in the game or competition.  All society has done in the last 5000 years is make the same old game of survival and genetic protection a vastly more complicated game rather then actually advancing social welfare and human progress.  \n  Everyone thinks we have all these great creations and super great inventions but in reality any thing invented was only a means of make physical labor less for some and eliminate the need for others at the same time. All the while the same human problems persist and the same human bias and genetic protection goes on between the classes and between the bloodlines of people that actually believe it will matter in 300 years.  The reality of it is that it wont matter jack shit.  Genetics are by nature made to mingle and spread out among the population of a species to further weed out genetic flaws and traits that are not needed and nature always finds a way to do this in it's own sweet time no matter how hard man tries to change that fact.\n\nMark Bradley2 years ago\nShort answer: Feminists took over the education system and have destroyed young men by design.\n\ndarthvader5300 3 minutes ago +Mat Broomfield Men made life adpapted to suit men's needs and their families, and they did the same to their educational system based on the boys' and men's brain thinking pattern which allowed humanity to climb from caves to the moon!\n\nFeminized education IS a fail. \"Numbers are a way that men oppress women; so what do you FEEL the answer is on your math-test?\"\n\nWhy is education failings boys? Let's ask two middle aged women. One has a nephew. That will get us to the bottom of things. Yeah, not bias at all. As usual, these morning shows are awful at discussing and debating societal issues.  If you think things are bad enough, Yvette Cooper (Labour MP) wants to make feminism a mandatory subject in education. Yes, that's right. She wants to impose her political ideology into our education system.  This is a disaster. If this were the other way around and the education system was failing girls, there would be an uproar. Society doesn't give a shit about male issues.\n\nTeachers biased in grading boys is really harmful. Schools should make it mandatory to grade tests etc. by codes and not names, so the teachers don't know who they're grading.\n\nTo all nutcases and political correctness crowd concerning about men's rights. We Russians and our KGB knows more about what is going on in the western world and you are practicing political correctness and suicidal liberalism and self-destructive multi-culturalism by wrongly saying you are skeptical of men's rights when in fact THE MEN AND BOYS ARE BEING INDISCRIMINATED SYSTEMATICALLY SINCE THE 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, AND UP TO THE PRESENT 2016 WHICH EXPLAINS THERE SHOULD BE A MEN'S RIGHTS LAW ACT AND BOYS RIGHTS LAW ACT TO PROTECT THEM FROM RADICAL FEMINIST EXTREMISTS TEACHERS AND PROFESSORS WHO ARE USING SUBTLE METHODS TO FAVOR ONLY GIRLS BUT NOT FAVOR BOYS EQUALLY SO AS TO REMAIN UNNOTICEABLE AND UNDETECTED UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE! You westerners are the most brainwashed and brain dead people that have I ever encounter during my active years in the Russian intelligence service before my retirement! You should be ashame for your lies that there is no need for the vitally needed men's rights act and boys rights act to be made into law and as a mandatory policy for you you know already that your fellow men and the boys are being indiscriminated by rabid criminal radical feminist extremists in your schools, universities who are destroying the original curriculum based on real education and neutrality that does not favor any gender or race at all. You are an out and out liar for this 92 year old KGB agent knows exactly what he is saying against you and your lies.",

IT WAS AND IT IS STILL MEN!  It was men who explored the wilderness, it was men who tamed the world to make it safe also for their women and children, it was men who constructed the required infrastructures and technostructues to lay down the foundation of the industrial revolution. It was men who patrolled and manned the fortified outposts of the Wild West and the Silk Road, it was men who defended the borders and patrolled the rivers from the time of Sumeria to the time of Ancient Rome and it was even continued during the Age of Voyages to the New World and the Age of Discovery. \n\nIt is only after men has tamed so much of the world (and fought each other that forged the military technologies that was later used for civilian peaceful purposes) that women were able to SAFELY participate in society. We men BLASTED THE WORLD TO TAME IT and now you indiscriminate against us after you are given a chance to participate in society. GET OUT OF YOUR SHELTERED LIFE AND FACE THE REALITIES OF HISTORY'S FACTS AND LOGIC. FACTS AND LOGIC ARE THE ENEMIES OF FEMINISTS-FEMINAZIS LIKE YOU. Ungrateful women who took the brainwashing wave of the women's movement in their teens and 20s and then coming to Dennis Prager with all of them saying \"I wish never made that decision\" and had a loving family now. Don't belive me? Call up Dennis Prager\" and check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLqHv0xgOlc&t=3s  Published on May 22, 2013\nFeminists and other leftists are useful idiots who serve only to destabilise the society. When the goal is reached, they will be \"lined up against the wall\". 1984 interview with a former KGB agent and Soviet diplomat, Yuri Bezmenov.\n\nWHEN I WAS A YOUNG KGB OFFICER DURING THE COLD WAR I ASK A PSYCHOLOGIST WHY IS IT THAT EVEN THE MOST MEDIOCRE MEN HAS THIS TENDENCY TO TURN INTO NEAR GENIUS OR TOTALLY GENIUS ONLY DURING IN TIMES OF WAR AS DEMONSTRATED TIME AND AGAIN THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND DURING WW I AND WW II AND HIS ANSWER IS BECAUSE MEN ARE LONG TERM THINKERS AND WAR IS A LONG TERM PROGRAM REQUIRING FAST THINKING AND HIGHLY PATTERNED ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES OF DUTY FUNCTIONS AND FAST READING AND COMPREHENSION AND ANALYSIS OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DATA GATHERING ACCOMPANIED WITH SWIFT REACTION-REFLEXES ON WHAT TO PLAN AND DO THE NEXT MOMENT. THIS MOTIVATES MEN TO BECOME FAST LEARNERS AND FAST DATA ASSIMILATORS TO CONNECT THE DOTS IN THE RIGHT PATTERN AFTER BEING FORCED TO LEARN TO SELECT WHICH DOTS OF INFORMATION MUST BE SELECTED FIRST! \n\nQUITE IRONIC THAT IT IS WAR AND ONLY DURING A WAR TIME PERIOD THAT MEN HAS THAT TENDENCY TO EXCEL. AND ONE WOMAN PSYCHOLOGIST SAID IT ALSO BECAUSE MEN EVOLVED FROM THAT HUNTER-GATHERER SURVIVALIST FOUNDATION THAT REQUIRES FAST LEARNING AND FAST THINKING AND FAST PERMANENT MEMORIZATION AND FAST COMPREHENSION OF THE SITUATIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES FROM ONE MOMENT TO THE NEXT. A women psychologist during the Cold War said that to me. By the way, that woman psychologist is a KGB officer involved in psychological warfare conducted against American, targeting American women with all sorts of women's movement brainwashing techniques. That was way back in the late 1950s and early 1960s. And you Eva Bukhryakova happened to be in it's way and became it's victim either directly or indirectly through our creations that we did through a 2sd Party which are the Rockefeller Foundation and others whose weaknesses for money we exploited for our brainwashing operations against the American women. Destroy American womanhood you destroy wifehood and motherhood, you destroy that you destroy the American family, destroy the American family you destroy American society, you destroy America society you destroy the American military which is now facing A LOT OF PROBLEMS BEING COVERED UP BY THE LEFTIST-LIBERAL MEDIA AND BY THE PENTAGON. And we KGB won the psychological warfare! Which is why many retired KGB women involved in psychological warfare are LAUGHING AT WOMEN AT YOU, LOL, BECAUSE YOU FELL INTO THE TRAPS THAT THEY CREATED FOR YOU Eva Bukhryakova! LOL!\n\nTHIS IS THE BASIS AND FOUNDATION OF SOVIET ERA EDUCATION FOR ALL RUSSIAN MEN. WE CREATED A CURRICULUM BASED ON THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL FINDINGS, TESTED THEM, IRON OUT THE KINKS, REFINE THEM, AND CREATED AN ACADEMIC SYSTEM BASED ON THE MALE'S BRAIN'S THINKING PATTERNS AND THINKING ATTITUDES. \n\nTHE RESULT? A VAST RESERVOIR OF SCIENTIFIC, ENGINEERING, ANDTECHNICAL TALENT COMPOSED LARGELY OF MEN. AS FOR THE WOMEN WE CREATED A CURRICULUM BASED ON THE FEMALE'S BRAIN'S THINKING PATTERN. THAT IS WHY EVEN THOUGH SCHOOLS ACCOMMODATES BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, THEIR CURRICULUM IS DIFFERENT, THAT IS IF ONE LOOKS VERY HARD FOR THE DIFFERENCES.\nShow less\nReply        \n\nNAMET IPSA2 months ago\ni know but a lie is easier to accept hence too many intellectually poor and hateful ppl like BLM, SJW's, Feminazis\nReply",

You do not see many countries created by women? And the women leaders of government basically ruin what men created. List would be Germany = Merkel,  UK=  Theresa May,  California=  Nancy Pelosi etc... Women ruin a lot. Name a Female Einstein? Closest you will get as far as highly intellectual is Marie Curie with help of her husband and Ada Lovelace. Name really smart women and there is a Man smarter. It is just basic science men have larger brain mass and brain mass determines intelligence. Dogs have more brain mass than cats, dogs are smarter than cats. Its all just basic science if you remove the political correctness.",

Abrum. however u spell that vjj hungry old beta's name. how many vjjs did u get after publishing such a sexist, women central study? there were no mentions of how many participants from each sex you ppl examined. it could have been 2 men to something like 20 women or 200 women and claim that women are smarter and just better over all than men. which is what woman's studies experts usually do when they design, conduct and publish a study. pretty much no method section and refusing any objective scholarly questions about any other aspect of their studies other than their conclusions. pathetic. \ndon't they realize that they them selves are exercising sexism against men? total hypocrites. \nim sorry, u ppl lack too many brain cells for self reflection and conducting real, careful and thorough researches that actually reflect the reality of the society. no point arguing with  4 year olds in older bodies.",

Its really part of a notion to attempt to prove that men and women are equal.

Not to mention empowering women creates a unsustainable fertility rate which causes its own problems and will lead to a collapse of society.",

A VAST RESERVOIR OF SCIENTIFIC, ENGINEERING, ANDTECHNICAL TALENT COMPOSED LARGELY OF MEN. AS FOR THE WOMEN WE CREATED A CURRICULUM BASED ON THE FEMALE'S BRAIN'S THINKING PATTERN.

Shit look at the entire world name one country where women weren't considered anything but a good fuck and kids machine before the 20th century, name one country instance where women created a village, a town or a city. These are the facts that women just can't handle they know deep down they are useless but only a few have enough common sense to actually to actually make themselves useful by at least cooking and cleaning for a man who decided to take their sorry ass in",

THIS IS ALSO A DELIBERATE ANTI-MALE GENDER PROPAGANDA LONG IN THE MAKING SINCE THE EARLY 1970s. How did we know? Simple, we have been observing American society as a whole, that's why we know and we have everything recorded, re-investigated and recorded again with a neutral analysis which shows a BIASED AND-MALE GENDER RIGGED EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND SOCIETY, and reported it back to our government to the other side of the pond.",

This is absolutely true because the educational and cultural system and environment and faculties has been high jacked by radical feminists-feminazis extremists. \n\nThe entire American educational system and faculties in all school levels at the primary level, high school level, and college level has been highjacked by radical feminists-feminazis in order to rig the entire educational and cultural system's curriculum to be unfairly in favor of girls only but at the expense of boys by rigging the schools' entire curriculm to be deliberately not in favor of them. \n\nBecause these unhinged boy-haters/man-haters radical feminists-feminazis main agenda is to deliberately sabotage any attempt of the young boys and young men from fully and properly developing their genetically endowed natural dominance oriented intelligence because if they are given the same equal opportunity(ies) to develop their intellectual-educational-psychological-IQ raising smarts potential THEY WILL SURPASS THE GIRLS AND WOMEN IF THE BOYS AND MEN ARE GIVEN THE SAME EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES IN ALL WALKS OF AMERICAN LIFE. \n\nBut what happened is that the unhinged radical feminists-feminazis has rigged the entire American society to be unfairly in favor of girls and women only while at the same time deliberately rigging it to deliberately sabotage the boys and men attempts to be successful in order to deliberately make them fail as part of their overt but subtle psychological warfare which is saying an implied FAKE MESSAGE SAYING YOU ARE A FAILURE WHEN IN FACT THESE EVIL RADICAL FEMINISTS-FEMINAZIS KNEW ALL THE TIME THEY ARE NOT A FAILURE BUT WERE INDISCRIMINATED AGAINST BY A RIGGED SYSTEM TO DELIBERTELY SABOTAGE THE BOYS AND MEN ATTEMPTS TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL ON THEIR OWN RIGHT  IN ALL WALKS OF AMERICAN LIFE IN PLACES OF STUDY AND OF WORK. \n\nIn short, all American women are practicing EQUALITY THROUGH INEQUALITY, especially after the evil unhinged radical feminists-feminazis extremists closet boy-haters/man-haters has infiltrated and highjacked the court system, the police system, the corporations, the work place, the educational system and academic faculties, government departments in order to rig them all to indiscriminate against boys and men, most especially if they are young. \n\nThey do not want equality, they want superiority when in fact their superiority came from the society-civilization created by SUPERIOR MEN OF INTELLECT AND VISIONS.  JUST LOOK AT HISTORY AND YOU WILL SEE WHO CREATED THESE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED CIVILIZATIONS THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM AND SKILLS TO ACCOMPLISH THEM ALL. IT WAS AND IT IS STILL MEN! \n\nWHEN I WAS A YOUNG OFFICER DURING THE COLD WAR I ASK A PSYCHOLOGIST WHY IS IT THAT EVEN THE MOST MEDIOCRE MEN HAS THIS TENDENCY TO TURN INTO NEAR GENIUS OR TOTALLY GENIUS ONLY DURING IN TIMES OF WAR AS DEMONSTRATED TIME AND AGAIN THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND DURING WW I AND WW II AND HIS ANSWER IS BECAUSE MEN ARE LONG TERM THINKERS AND WAR IS A LONG TERM PROGRAM REQUIRING FAST THINKING AND HIGHLY PATTERNED ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES OF DUTY FUNCTIONS AND FAST READING AND COMPREHENSION AND ANALYSIS OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DATA GATHERING ACCOMPANIED WITH SWIFT REACTION-REFLEXES ON WHAT TO PLAN AND DO THE NEXT MOMENT. THIS MOTIVATES MEN TO BECOME FAST LEARNERS AND FAST DATA ASSIMILATORS TO CONNECT THE DOTS IN THE RIGHT PATTERN AFTER BEING FORCED TO LEARN TO SELECT WHICH DOTS OF INFORMATION MUST BE SELECTED FIRST! \n\nQUITE IRONIC THAT IT IS WAR AND ONLY DURING A WAR TIME PERIOD THAT MEN HAS THAT TENDENCY TO EXCEL. AND ONE WOMAN PSYCHOLOGIST SAID IT ALSO BECAUSE MEN EVOLVED FROM THAT HUNTER-GATHERER SURVIVALIST FOUNDATION THAT REQUIRES FAST LEARNING AND FAST THINKING AND FAST PERMANENT MEMORIZATION AND FAST COMPREHENSION OF THE SITUATIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES FROM ONE MOMENT TO THE NEXT. \n\nTHIS IS THE BASIS AND FOUNDATION OF SOVIET ERA EDUCATION FOR ALL RUSSIAN MEN. WE CREATED A CURRICULUM BASED ON THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL FINDINGS, TESTED THEM, IRON OUT THE KINKS, REFINE THEM, AND CREATED AN ACADEMIC SYSTEM BASED ON THE MALE'S BRAIN'S THINKING PATTERNS AND THINKING ATTITUDES. \n\nTHE RESULT? A VAST RESERVOIR OF SCIENTIFIC, ENGINEERING, ANDTECHNICAL TALENT COMPOSED LARGELY OF MEN. AS FOR THE WOMEN WE CREATED A CURRICULUM BASED ON THE FEMALE'S BRAIN'S THINKING PATTERN. THAT IS WHY EVEN THOUGH SCHOOLS ACCOMMODATES BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, THEIR CURRICULUM IS DIFFERENT, THAT IS IF ONE LOOKS VERY HARD FOR THE DIFFERENCES.",

Well, the gig is up. After the Cold War, the Soviet Government released it's NON-BIASED FINDINGS TO MANY MEN and they all admitted that it is true. How did we know? Simple: During the Cold War we have been observing American society as a whole, watching-recording-analyzing and even our female KGB members are laughing at you American women who have fallen for this false female superiority/biased/indiscriminatory and NARCISSISTIC view against men and toward all men and boys of all ages. American women are a laugh! Since the late 1980s American men and European men are gravitating toward Russian women and by late 1990s our own census counted 12 million male westerners residing inside Russia, now it is 16 million male westerners, the main bulk coming from America and Canada. Of course the biased liberal MSM will not report nor acknowledge this and over the years there are those who doubted me so my response is this: SINCE THIS IS A FREE WORLD, WHY DON'T YOU BUY A 2-WAY TICKET TO RUSSIA AND STAY THERE TO INVESTIGATE EVERYTHING \"EVERYWHERE\" and no cherry picking/cheating!",

Artemisinin is isolated from the plant Artemisia annua, sweet wormwood, a herb employed in Chinese traditional medicine.[3]AzathioprineAzathioprine is an Immunosuppressive drug used in rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and in kidney transplants to prevent rejection first synthesized by George H. Hitchings and Gertrude B. Elion in 1957 .\nMercaptopurineMercaptopurine is a medication for cancerand autoimmune diseases including acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. It was discovered byGertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitching. PyrimethaminePyrimethamine, sold under the trade name Daraprim, is an anti-parasitic medication used to treat a variety of conditions including toxoplasmosis and isosporiasis.Pyrimethamine was initially developed by Nobel Prize winning scientist Gertrude Elionas a treatment for malaria. \nAZTGertrude Elion made foundational contributions to the development of AZT, one of the first antiretroviral medicationsused in the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS.[10]Vitamin EKatharine Bishop and Herbert McLean Evans co-discovered Vitamin E while studying the reproductive cycle of rats.\n\nApgar scoreInvented in 1952 by Virginia Apgar.Disposable diapers\n\nThe first disposable diaper was invented in 1946 by Marion Donovan, a professional-turned-housewife who wanted to ensure her children's cloth diapers remained dry while they slept.[12] Donovan patented her design (called 'Boaters') in 1951. She also invented the first paper diapers, but executives did not invest in this idea and it was consequently scrapped for over ten years, until Procter & Gamble used Donovan's design ideas to create Pampers.\n\nAnother diaper design was created by Valerie Hunter Gordon (née de Ferranti), who patented it in 1948. \n\nChild carriersSnugli and Weego were invented by nurse and peacekeeper Ann Moore first in the 1960s.PertussisA pioneering female American doctor, medical researcher and an outspoken voice in the pediatric community, the supercentenarian Leila Alice Denmark(1898–2012) is credited as co-developer of the pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine.\n\nAstronomy and astrophysics\n\nHarvard Stellar Classification SchemeThe first classification of stars based on their temperature, created by Annie Jump Cannon, used in publications up to 1924.PulsarsRapidly rotating neutron stars discovered by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967.The Galaxy Rotation ProblemA major piece of evidence for the presence of dark matter in the Universe, discovered by Vera Rubin from observations of galactic rotation curves in the 1970s.Stars luminosityHenrietta Swan Leavitt was an American astronomer who discovered the relation between the luminosity and the period of Cepheid variable stars at the beginning of 20th century.Radio astronomyRuby Violet Payne-Scott was an Australian pioneer in radiophysics and radio astronomy as well as the first female radio astronomer[15] discovering Type I and Type III solar radio bursts.Stars are primarily composed of hydrogenand heliumCecilia Payne-Gaposchkin found in her 1925 PhD thesis that stars are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. Thus, her thesis established that hydrogen is the most abundant element in the Universe. When Payne's dissertation was reviewed, astronomer Henry Norris Russell dissuaded her from concluding that the composition of the Sun was predominantly hydrogen and thus very different from that of the Earth, as it contradicted the accepted wisdom at the time. She consequently described the result in her thesis as \"spurious\". Russell realized she was correct four years later after having derived the same result by different means and publishing it in 1929. He acknowledged Payne's work and discovery admiringly in his paper but he is often credited for the conclusions they both reached.\nThe new outer arm of the Milky WayIn 2004, astrophysicist and radio astronomer Naomi McClure-Griffithsidentified a new spiral arm of the Milky Waygalaxy.",

        "commentText": "@nathanlief Physics\nRadiation\nMarie Curie (born Maria Salomea Skłodowska) was the first woman to receive a Nobel prize for her works on radiations and, up until today,[when?] the only woman to receive two Nobel prizes (among them, one Nobel prize in chemistry for discoveries on Polonium and Radium). She is the sole laureate to be recognized within two distinct scientific areas.Fanny Gates further investigated the properties of radiation. Together with Ernest Rutherford, she amassed evidence that radioactivity was not the result of any simple chemical or physical processes.[21]In particular, Gates showed that radioactivity could not be destroyed by heat or ionization due to chemical reactions, and that radioactive materials differ from phosphorescent materials both qualitatively and quantitatively.[22]\n\nRadon\nIn 1901, Harriet Brooks and Ernest Rutherford contributed to the discovery of the element Radon by finding evidence that the “emanation” emitted by thoriumcompounds was likely to be a gas [23]. This follows work in 1899 by Pierre and Marie Curie, who observed that the gas emitted by radium remained radioactive for a month.\n\nKinetic energy\nEmilie du Châtelet (born Gabrielle Émilie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil) translated Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica from Latin to French during the 18th century. She carried out physics experiments, popularizing the work of Leibniz. She demonstrated that the kinetic energy of an object was proportional to its mass and the square of its velocity, and postulated a conservation law for the total energy of a system.Heavy elements in cosmic radiationAs a graduate student, Phyllis S. Freierfound evidence for the existence of elements heavier than helium in cosmic radiation.Her work was published in Physical Review in 1948 with co-authors Edward J. Lofgren, Edward P. Ney, and Frank Oppenheimer.[25]Beta particles are electronsGertrude Scharff Goldhaber and her husband Maurice Goldhaber showed that beta particles were identical to electrons\n\nTop quark\nMelissa Franklin's team at Fermilab found some of the first evidence for the existence of the top quark. Nuclear shellMaria Goeppert Mayer, a German immigrant to the US who studied at Johns Hopkinsduring the Great Depression, persisted in her studies even when no university would employ her and became a chemical physicist. Her most-famous contribution to modern physics was discovering the nuclear shell of the atomic nucleus, for which she won the Nobel Prize in 1963. \n\nSlow light\nLene Hau led a Harvard University team who used a Bose-Einstein condensate toslow down a beam of light to about 17 metres per second, and, in 2001, was able to stop a beam completely.\n\nAstatine\nThe Austrian physicist Berta Karlikdiscovered that the element 85 astatine is a product of the natural decay processes\n\nBohr–van Leeuwen theorem\nIn her 1919 thesis  Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen explained why magnetism is an essentially quantum mechanical effect, a result now referred to as the Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem. (Niels Bohr had arrived at the same conclusion a few years earlier.)\n\nFrancium\nIn 1939 Marguerite Perey, a student of Marie Curie, discovered the element francium by purifying samples of lanthanum that contained actinium. Perey first noticed that the actinium she purified was emitting unexpected radiation. After further study she was able to isolate this new element which she named \"francium\" for France.\n\nNuclear fission\nAustrian-Swedish physicist Lise Meitner, together with Otto Hahn and Otto Robert Frisch, led the small group of scientists who first discovered nuclear fission of uranium when it absorbed an extra neutron. The results were published in early 1939.\nMeitner, Hahn and Frisch understood that the fission process, which splits the atomic nucleus of uranium into two smaller nuclei, must be accompanied by an enormous release of energy. Nuclear fission is the process exploited by nuclear reactors to generate heat and, subsequently, electricity.[34] This process is also one of the basics of nuclear weapons that were developed in the U.S. during World War IIand used against Japan in 1945.\n\nStructure of the Milky Way\nHeidi Jo Newberg's team found that Milky Way is cannibalizing stars from smaller galaxies and that the Milky Way is larger and has more ripples than was previously understood.\n\nChirped pulse amplification\nDonna Strickland received the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of chirped pulse amplification, a technique which \"paved the way towards the shortest and most intense laser pulses ever created by mankind.\"",

There is a reason why men do what they do and its for your benefit. Men want healthy women to reproduce and be a benefit to society. These days its really hard to find good men and good women. I do not look down on you or females in general, I am just pointing out the statistics and Math nothing more.",

Do a good job and I will pay you for a good job, just like any company. There is no such things as a wage gap. If I could pay a women 70% to the dollar I wouldn't, its a myth. No woman does the exact same job as a man and gets paid 30% less, that would be horrible for business, or self worth, or self respect. If you can produce the same you will get paid the same. Look at trucking, or logistics, do you think you can pay a female driver less doing the same job? Most people do not even understand how a business functions. I pay women more because they in general show up on time, do not drink as much if at all, and have a better work ethic in my personal experience. I live in the south and Southern Women can work and usually better than Men in my personal experience, especially if they have a family. Not to speak down to men in the south who have a family, its just my observation that they tend to drink more and that affects their ability to work regularly. Women that  have to work FUCKING work, Like beast mode work, if you hire a farm girl in the south you are set, she will run shit, fuck they run the shit out of me and want more!",

Do females have to carry millions of microscopic sperm in their genitalia and have to worry about getting hit between the legs? Nope. One hit to the testicles and that male will not have children. Testicular torsion is so painful that males die from it and lose sperm cells. If you die from Testicular torsion, then it’s definitely worse than giving birth, I’d honestly rather give birth than go through that. You females are lucky you don’t have testicles and large muscle mass.",

See women come from their fathers testicles, that’s how most women or everyone starts out, they start in the testicles of a MAN, it’s called sperm. The male is supposed insert his penis inside of a female, then the friction of the females vagina creates an orgasm between the two mates, and then this liquid white substance comes out from the males penis and that is called cum, cum provides millions of sperm. And when that cum from the males penis makes it into the females vagina, the millions of sperms then try to race to the ovaries, when one or two sperms make it into the ovaries, the eggs inside of the ovaries basically evolutes the form of the sperm.

And give the evidence of men doing 90% of death related works!!!! Regarding the gender gap myth well the truth is bitter you including those men who conducted those statistics to a limited group of people to prove that gender pay gap is a myth so that men like you can go around beating the drum...... If you think women are equally paid maybe you must extend your knowledge of it in more other areas but I sounds funny at the same time when a man whose spouse earns more money than him feels highly shameful about it & these men often feel shame that often turn to rage & they are most likely to show passive-aggressive behavior!!!! And it's interesting how you men twist facts here about how women ruin men's lives in court or whatever when all they are trying to do is to fight for their rights that they country provides or gives them the right to do so... So blame the LAW not the WOMEN !!!! And it's shameful for you to say that if a women calls a man rapist his entire life is ruined how pathetic for you to say that... what about women who have been raped for real and men trying to act like they didn't do it, these influential men rape women & when a woman complains about it, she is LYING, and her character reduces herself to nothing in the society that supports such men!!!! Your comment has to do more with the West, but looks like you are forgetting about the other's side of the world that have the most population & where women don't have privileges to their own basic rights & courts hardly favors them so please look through a birds eye view and not through a worms eye view to prove or justify you non evidential points here, Atleast for the sake of calling yourself a Man like as if you chose that gender before being born into the world!!!!",

    "commentText": "Women only look smarter because the system is rigged against men. This is absolutely true because the educational and cultural system and environment and faculties has been high jacked by radical feminists-feminazis extremists. \n\nThe entire American educational system and faculties in all school levels at the primary level, high school level, and college level has been highjacked by radical feminists-feminazis in order to rig the entire educational and cultural system's curriculum to be unfairly in favor of girls only but at the expense of boys by rigging the schools' entire curriculm to be deliberately not in favor of them. \n\nBecause these unhinged boy-haters/man-haters radical feminists-feminazis main agenda is to deliberately sabotage any attempt of the young boys and young men from fully and properly developing their genetically endowed natural dominance oriented intelligence because if they are given the same equal opportunity(ies) to develop their intellectual-educational-psychological-IQ raising smarts potential THEY WILL SURPASS THE GIRLS AND WOMEN IF THE BOYS AND MEN ARE GIVEN THE SAME EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES IN ALL WALKS OF AMERICAN LIFE. \n\nBut what happened is that the unhinged radical feminists-feminazis has rigged the entire American society to be unfairly in favor of girls and women only while at the same time deliberately rigging it to deliberately sabotage the boys and men attempts to be successful in order to deliberately make them fail as part of their overt but subtle psychological warfare which is saying an implied FAKE MESSAGE SAYING YOU ARE A FAILURE WHEN IN FACT THESE EVIL RADICAL FEMINISTS-FEMINAZIS KNEW ALL THE TIME THEY ARE NOT A FAILURE BUT WERE INDISCRIMINATED AGAINST BY A RIGGED SYSTEM TO DELIBERTELY SABOTAGE THE BOYS AND MEN ATTEMPTS TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL ON THEIR OWN RIGHT  IN ALL WALKS OF AMERICAN LIFE IN PLACES OF STUDY AND OF WORK. \n\nIn short, all American women are practicing EQUALITY THROUGH INEQUALITY, especially after the evil unhinged radical feminists-feminazis extremists closet boy-haters/man-haters has infiltrated and highjacked the court system, the police system, the corporations, the work place, the educational system and academic faculties, government departments in order to rig them all to indiscriminate against boys and men, most especially if they are young. \n\nThey do not want equality, they want superiority when in fact their superiority came from the society-civilization created by SUPERIOR MEN OF INTELLECT AND VISIONS.  JUST LOOK AT HISTORY AND YOU WILL SEE WHO CREATED THESE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED CIVILIZATIONS THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM AND SKILLS TO ACCOMPLISH THEM ALL. IT WAS AND IT IS STILL MEN! \n\nWHEN I WAS A YOUNG OFFICER DURING THE COLD WAR I ASK A PSYCHOLOGIST WHY IS IT THAT EVEN THE MOST MEDIOCRE MEN HAS THIS TENDENCY TO TURN INTO NEAR GENIUS OR TOTALLY GENIUS ONLY DURING IN TIMES OF WAR AS DEMONSTRATED TIME AND AGAIN THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND DURING WW I AND WW II AND HIS ANSWER IS BECAUSE MEN ARE LONG TERM THINKERS AND WAR IS A LONG TERM PROGRAM REQUIRING FAST THINKING AND HIGHLY PATTERNED ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES OF DUTY FUNCTIONS AND FAST READING AND COMPREHENSION AND ANALYSIS OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DATA GATHERING ACCOMPANIED WITH SWIFT REACTION-REFLEXES ON WHAT TO PLAN AND DO THE NEXT MOMENT. THIS MOTIVATES MEN TO BECOME FAST LEARNERS AND FAST DATA ASSIMILATORS TO CONNECT THE DOTS IN THE RIGHT PATTERN AFTER BEING FORCED TO LEARN TO SELECT WHICH DOTS OF INFORMATION MUST BE SELECTED FIRST! \n\nQUITE IRONIC THAT IT IS WAR AND ONLY DURING A WAR TIME PERIOD THAT MEN HAS THAT TENDENCY TO EXCEL. AND ONE WOMAN PSYCHOLOGIST SAID IT ALSO BECAUSE MEN EVOLVED FROM THAT HUNTER-GATHERER SURVIVALIST FOUNDATION THAT REQUIRES FAST LEARNING AND FAST THINKING AND FAST PERMANENT MEMORIZATION AND FAST COMPREHENSION OF THE SITUATIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES FROM ONE MOMENT TO THE NEXT. \n\nTHIS IS THE BASIS AND FOUNDATION OF SOVIET ERA EDUCATION FOR ALL RUSSIAN MEN. WE CREATED A CURRICULUM BASED ON THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL FINDINGS, TESTED THEM, IRON OUT THE KINKS, REFINE THEM, AND CREATED AN ACADEMIC SYSTEM BASED ON THE MALE'S BRAIN'S THINKING PATTERNS AND THINKING ATTITUDES. \n\nTHE RESULT? A VAST RESERVOIR OF SCIENTIFIC, ENGINEERING, ANDTECHNICAL TALENT COMPOSED LARGELY OF MEN. AS FOR THE WOMEN WE CREATED A CURRICULUM BASED ON THE FEMALE'S BRAIN'S THINKING PATTERN. THAT IS WHY EVEN THOUGH SCHOOLS ACCOMMODATES BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, THEIR CURRICULUM IS DIFFERENT, THAT IS IF ONE LOOKS VERY HARD FOR THE DIFFERENCES.",

This is absolutely true because the educational and cultural system and environment and faculties has been high jacked by radical feminists-feminazis extremists. \n\nThe entire American educational system and faculties in all school levels at the primary level, high school level, and college level has been highjacked by radical feminists-feminazis in order to rig the entire educational and cultural system's curriculum to be unfairly in favor of girls only but at the expense of boys by rigging the schools' entire curriculm to be deliberately not in favor of them. \n\nBecause these unhinged boy-haters/man-haters radical feminists-feminazis main agenda is to deliberately sabotage any attempt of the young boys and young men from fully and properly developing their genetically endowed natural dominance oriented intelligence because if they are given the same equal opportunity(ies) to develop their intellectual-educational-psychological-IQ raising smarts potential THEY WILL SURPASS THE GIRLS AND WOMEN IF THE BOYS AND MEN ARE GIVEN THE SAME EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES IN ALL WALKS OF AMERICAN LIFE. \n\nBut what happened is that the unhinged radical feminists-feminazis has rigged the entire American society to be unfairly in favor of girls and women only while at the same time deliberately rigging it to deliberately sabotage the boys and men attempts to be successful in order to deliberately make them fail as part of their overt but subtle psychological warfare which is saying an implied FAKE MESSAGE SAYING YOU ARE A FAILURE WHEN IN FACT THESE EVIL RADICAL FEMINISTS-FEMINAZIS KNEW ALL THE TIME THEY ARE NOT A FAILURE BUT WERE INDISCRIMINATED AGAINST BY A RIGGED SYSTEM TO DELIBERTELY SABOTAGE THE BOYS AND MEN ATTEMPTS TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL ON THEIR OWN RIGHT  IN ALL WALKS OF AMERICAN LIFE IN PLACES OF STUDY AND OF WORK. \n\nIn short, all American women are practicing EQUALITY THROUGH INEQUALITY, especially after the evil unhinged radical feminists-feminazis extremists closet boy-haters/man-haters has infiltrated and highjacked the court system, the police system, the corporations, the work place, the educational system and academic faculties, government departments in order to rig them all to indiscriminate against boys and men, most especially if they are young. \n\nThey do not want equality, they want superiority when in fact their superiority came from the society-civilization created by SUPERIOR MEN OF INTELLECT AND VISIONS.  JUST LOOK AT HISTORY AND YOU WILL SEE WHO CREATED THESE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED CIVILIZATIONS THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM AND SKILLS TO ACCOMPLISH THEM ALL. IT WAS AND IT IS STILL MEN! \n\nWHEN I WAS A YOUNG OFFICER DURING THE COLD WAR I ASK A PSYCHOLOGIST WHY IS IT THAT EVEN THE MOST MEDIOCRE MEN HAS THIS TENDENCY TO TURN INTO NEAR GENIUS OR TOTALLY GENIUS ONLY DURING IN TIMES OF WAR AS DEMONSTRATED TIME AND AGAIN THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND DURING WW I AND WW II AND HIS ANSWER IS BECAUSE MEN ARE LONG TERM THINKERS AND WAR IS A LONG TERM PROGRAM REQUIRING FAST THINKING AND HIGHLY PATTERNED ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES OF DUTY FUNCTIONS AND FAST READING AND COMPREHENSION AND ANALYSIS OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DATA GATHERING ACCOMPANIED WITH SWIFT REACTION-REFLEXES ON WHAT TO PLAN AND DO THE NEXT MOMENT. THIS MOTIVATES MEN TO BECOME FAST LEARNERS AND FAST DATA ASSIMILATORS TO CONNECT THE DOTS IN THE RIGHT PATTERN AFTER BEING FORCED TO LEARN TO SELECT WHICH DOTS OF INFORMATION MUST BE SELECTED FIRST! \n\nQUITE IRONIC THAT IT IS WAR AND ONLY DURING A WAR TIME PERIOD THAT MEN HAS THAT TENDENCY TO EXCEL. AND ONE WOMAN PSYCHOLOGIST SAID IT ALSO BECAUSE MEN EVOLVED FROM THAT HUNTER-GATHERER SURVIVALIST FOUNDATION THAT REQUIRES FAST LEARNING AND FAST THINKING AND FAST PERMANENT MEMORIZATION AND FAST COMPREHENSION OF THE SITUATIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES FROM ONE MOMENT TO THE NEXT. \n\nTHIS IS THE BASIS AND FOUNDATION OF SOVIET ERA EDUCATION FOR ALL RUSSIAN MEN. WE CREATED A CURRICULUM BASED ON THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL FINDINGS, TESTED THEM, IRON OUT THE KINKS, REFINE THEM, AND CREATED AN ACADEMIC SYSTEM BASED ON THE MALE'S BRAIN'S THINKING PATTERNS AND THINKING ATTITUDES. \n\nTHE RESULT? A VAST RESERVOIR OF SCIENTIFIC, ENGINEERING, ANDTECHNICAL TALENT COMPOSED LARGELY OF MEN. AS FOR THE WOMEN WE CREATED A CURRICULUM BASED ON THE FEMALE'S BRAIN'S THINKING PATTERN. THAT IS WHY EVEN THOUGH SCHOOLS ACCOMMODATES BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, THEIR CURRICULUM IS DIFFERENT, THAT IS IF ONE LOOKS VERY HARD FOR THE DIFFERENCES.",

Then, when women gain rights you get inventions like the computer and software, windshield wipers (couldn’t drive in the rain without them), space station batteries (major step in going to space for the first time), controlled nuclear fission of different chemical elements (invention of nuclear bombs), stem cell isolation (curing cancer), Kevlar (bulletproof vests for police officers and anyone serving), etc. So, comments like this just make you look uneducated, and the other people too.

Estrogen and testosterone).  I think the field of science is still too young and there are way too many invisible social forces around us to tell us if the differences we see are due to something biochemically inside of us.  Yes, on average, women are different than men in some ways.  However, our differences may not be caused by what we think.",

The reason more women take psychology and English (jobs that you say are somehow “easier” than other jobs) is because women in general have better communication skills than men, and are emotionally much more intelligent then men. (Just think about it, psychology and English may be two jobs that are easier for women and harder for men.) So in a way, both genders are smarter than each other in different ways. If we can all somehow learn to get past “who’s smarter” when comes to not only gender, but anything else, I believe that if men and women use their strengths in the future and can work together, then some great things could happen.",

Men, for example, are often said to be better at math and scientific reasoning while women are better at reading and empathizing.\"\n\n\"Each sex has advantages over other\" and then tells men are good at maths and science + reasoning whilst women are good at reading and empathising wtf? How the fuck is even a respectable comparison to qualities present in the male counterparts? But no let's type they both advantage each other now a guy did some research few years ago where he claimed that women had more iq than men on an average and the news was picked up by libtard media immediately with headlines \"women are smarter than men!\" That was the actual title and the reporter said \"for the first time in more than 100 years women have higher iq than men\" and I pisses myself laughin how they were insulting themselves like first in 100 years and you yell it in our ears based on the book written by a MAN gods know what he is agenda must have been never saw titles like \"men are smarter than women\" for last decades nope gender inequality works only one way you never have to prove that you're important if you are your presence will be noted so I'm goin to end this debate now.",

This is absolutely true because the educational and cultural system and environment and faculties has been high jacked by radical feminists-feminazis extremists. \n\nThe entire American educational system and faculties in all school levels at the primary level, high school level, and college level has been highjacked by radical feminists-feminazis in order to rig the entire educational and cultural system's curriculum to be unfairly in favor of girls only but at the expense of boys by rigging the schools' entire curriculm to be deliberately not in favor of them. \n\nBecause these unhinged boy-haters/man-haters radical feminists-feminazis main agenda is to deliberately sabotage any attempt of the young boys and young men from fully and properly developing their genetically endowed natural dominance oriented intelligence because if they are given the same equal opportunity(ies) to develop their intellectual-educational-psychological-IQ raising smarts potential THEY WILL SURPASS THE GIRLS AND WOMEN IF THE BOYS AND MEN ARE GIVEN THE SAME EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES IN ALL WALKS OF AMERICAN LIFE. \n\nBut what happened is that the unhinged radical feminists-feminazis has rigged the entire American society to be unfairly in favor of girls and women only while at the same time deliberately rigging it to deliberately sabotage the boys and men attempts to be successful in order to deliberately make them fail as part of their overt but subtle psychological warfare which is saying an implied FAKE MESSAGE SAYING YOU ARE A FAILURE WHEN IN FACT THESE EVIL RADICAL FEMINISTS-FEMINAZIS KNEW ALL THE TIME THEY ARE NOT A FAILURE BUT WERE INDISCRIMINATED AGAINST BY A RIGGED SYSTEM TO DELIBERTELY SABOTAGE THE BOYS AND MEN ATTEMPTS TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL ON THEIR OWN RIGHT  IN ALL WALKS OF AMERICAN LIFE IN PLACES OF STUDY AND OF WORK. \n\nIn short, all American women are practicing EQUALITY THROUGH INEQUALITY, especially after the evil unhinged radical feminists-feminazis extremists closet boy-haters/man-haters has infiltrated and highjacked the court system, the police system, the corporations, the work place, the educational system and academic faculties, government departments in order to rig them all to indiscriminate against boys and men, most especially if they are young. \n\nThey do not want equality, they want superiority when in fact their superiority came from the society-civilization created by SUPERIOR MEN OF INTELLECT AND VISIONS.  JUST LOOK AT HISTORY AND YOU WILL SEE WHO CREATED THESE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED CIVILIZATIONS THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM AND SKILLS TO ACCOMPLISH THEM ALL. IT WAS AND IT IS STILL MEN! \n\nWHEN I WAS A YOUNG OFFICER DURING THE COLD WAR I ASK A PSYCHOLOGIST WHY IS IT THAT EVEN THE MOST MEDIOCRE MEN HAS THIS TENDENCY TO TURN INTO NEAR GENIUS OR TOTALLY GENIUS ONLY DURING IN TIMES OF WAR AS DEMONSTRATED TIME AND AGAIN THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND DURING WW I AND WW II AND HIS ANSWER IS BECAUSE MEN ARE LONG TERM THINKERS AND WAR IS A LONG TERM PROGRAM REQUIRING FAST THINKING AND HIGHLY PATTERNED ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES OF DUTY FUNCTIONS AND FAST READING AND COMPREHENSION AND ANALYSIS OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DATA GATHERING ACCOMPANIED WITH SWIFT REACTION-REFLEXES ON WHAT TO PLAN AND DO THE NEXT MOMENT. THIS MOTIVATES MEN TO BECOME FAST LEARNERS AND FAST DATA ASSIMILATORS TO CONNECT THE DOTS IN THE RIGHT PATTERN AFTER BEING FORCED TO LEARN TO SELECT WHICH DOTS OF INFORMATION MUST BE SELECTED FIRST! \n\nQUITE IRONIC THAT IT IS WAR AND ONLY DURING A WAR TIME PERIOD THAT MEN HAS THAT TENDENCY TO EXCEL. AND ONE WOMAN PSYCHOLOGIST SAID IT ALSO BECAUSE MEN EVOLVED FROM THAT HUNTER-GATHERER SURVIVALIST FOUNDATION THAT REQUIRES FAST LEARNING AND FAST THINKING AND FAST PERMANENT MEMORIZATION AND FAST COMPREHENSION OF THE SITUATIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES FROM ONE MOMENT TO THE NEXT. \n\nTHIS IS THE BASIS AND FOUNDATION OF SOVIET ERA EDUCATION FOR ALL RUSSIAN MEN. WE CREATED A CURRICULUM BASED ON THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL FINDINGS, TESTED THEM, IRON OUT THE KINKS, REFINE THEM, AND CREATED AN ACADEMIC SYSTEM BASED ON THE MALE'S BRAIN'S THINKING PATTERNS AND THINKING ATTITUDES. \n\nTHE RESULT? A VAST RESERVOIR OF SCIENTIFIC, ENGINEERING, ANDTECHNICAL TALENT COMPOSED LARGELY OF MEN. AS FOR THE WOMEN WE CREATED A CURRICULUM BASED ON THE FEMALE'S BRAIN'S THINKING PATTERN. THAT IS WHY EVEN THOUGH SCHOOLS ACCOMMODATES BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, THEIR CURRICULUM IS DIFFERENT, THAT IS IF ONE LOOKS VERY HARD FOR THE DIFFERENCES.",

Your success were BUILT UPON THE FOUNDATIONS OF CIVILIZATIONS CREATED BY HIGHLY INTELLIGENT MEN and when you were given a chance to participate you became narcissistic, one-side, indiscriminatory, PC lies Card users, Gender Card users, and whatever evil Liberalism Card invented by unhigned leftists-liberals has been inventing. Well, the gig is up. After the Cold War, the Soviet Government released it's NON-BIASED FINDINGS TO MANY MEN and they all admitted that it is true. How did we know? Simple: During the Cold War we have been observing American society as a whole, watching-recording-analyzing and even our female KGB members are laughing at you American women who have fallen for this false female superiority/biased/indiscriminatory and NARCISSISTIC view against men and toward all men and boys of all ages. American women are a laugh! Since the late 1980s American men and European men are gravitating toward Russian women and by late 1990s our own census counted 12 million male westerners residing inside Russia, now it is 16 million male westerners, the main bulk coming from America and Canada. Of course the biased liberal MSM will not report nor acknowledge this and over the years there are those who doubted me so my response is this: SINCE THIS IS A FREE WORLD, WHY DON'T YOU BUY A 2-WAY TICKET TO RUSSIA AND STAY THERE TO INVESTIGATE EVERYTHING \"EVERYWHERE\" and no cherry picking/cheating!",

Why do some people leap onto the burning of a few hundred witches as evidence of the oppression and hatred experienced by women yet conveniently ignore the hundreds of thousands of men butchered, tortured,imprisoned or forced to die building monuments like the pyramids. Oh, that-that doesn't count.\n\nNothing has changed. Boko Haram butcher hundreds of schoolboys and most of the world still doesn't even know. A couple of hundred schoolgirls get kidnapped and the whole world is horrified and goes into meltdown. ISIS slaughter thousands of men, crucify some and behead hundreds and no-one refers to the fact that is is men being massacred. Women get kidnapped and sold by the ISIS terrorists and the world recoils in horror and calls it \"A War on Women\" Sick isn't it?\n\nLittle boys were still working in the mines and scuttling up the inside of chimneys to clean them long after such practices for girls were outlawed. The chimney sweep boys died horrible deaths at a young age due to the cancers this filthy, dangerous  job created.\n\nBut we were so mean to women!\n\nThere were thousands of women who lived privileged lives of comfort whilst untold numbers of men risked their lives in dirty, exhausting, often deadly jobs.\n\nOpen your eyes.",

I will be fair i looked up all the female inventors and Patricia Billings invented a indestructible and fireproof building material called Geobond,Edith\nFlanigen was the inventor of a petroleum refining method and is considered one of the most inventive chemists of all time ,there are many other women inventors, mostly i see women improving on inventions that have all ready been invented(like windshield whiper to a car)and not comeing up with things like archimedes principle ,newtons law,and E =mc squared, many of these inventions done by women go unoticed compared to man,conclusion women inventors are not that life changeing, atleast not yet.I am a man I am not better or smater then a woman, but i see things like a chess game ,if we argue or trade points , I see moves ahead, because i am not good at useing my right side of my brain has the ladies.",

If the women who were saving you were built up as males, would you like them to save you less than men or would you view them equally? Physical strength is not the same as mental strength. Also, women also have a tendency to think with emotions and as humans, we are quite empathetic so they would probably panic more and try to get everybody out quickly because women tend to be better at emotional empathy than men.

THIS MOTIVATES MEN TO BECOME FAST LEARNERS AND FAST DATA ASSIMILATORS TO CONNECT THE DOTS IN THE RIGHT PATTERN AFTER BEING FORCED TO LEARN TO SELECT WHICH DOTS OF INFORMATION MUST BE SELECTED FIRST! \n\nQUITE IRONIC THAT IT IS WAR AND ONLY DURING A WAR TIME PERIOD THAT MEN HAS THAT TENDENCY TO EXCEL. AND ONE WOMAN PSYCHOLOGIST SAID IT ALSO BECAUSE MEN EVOLVED FROM THAT HUNTER-GATHERER SURVIVALIST FOUNDATION THAT REQUIRES FAST LEARNING AND FAST THINKING AND FAST PERMANENT MEMORIZATION AND FAST COMPREHENSION OF THE SITUATIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES FROM ONE MOMENT TO THE NEXT. \n\nTHIS IS THE BASIS AND FOUNDATION OF SOVIET ERA EDUCATION FOR ALL RUSSIAN MEN. WE CREATED A CURRICULUM BASED ON THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL FINDINGS, TESTED THEM, IRON OUT THE KINKS, REFINE THEM, AND CREATED AN ACADEMIC SYSTEM BASED ON THE MALE'S BRAIN'S THINKING PATTERNS AND THINKING ATTITUDES. \n\nTHE RESULT? A VAST RESERVOIR OF SCIENTIFIC, ENGINEERING, ANDTECHNICAL TALENT COMPOSED LARGELY OF MEN. AS FOR THE WOMEN WE CREATED A CURRICULUM BASED ON THE FEMALE'S BRAIN'S THINKING PATTERN. THAT IS WHY EVEN THOUGH SCHOOLS ACCOMMODATES BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, THEIR CURRICULUM IS DIFFERENT, THAT IS IF ONE LOOKS VERY HARD FOR THE DIFFERENCES.",

It’s strange how you focus on one thing like the space station battery. That is an enormous invention that has allowed people to stay in space long term.

In eastern civilizations women participated as soldiers in war, and most of these civilizations were run by women (i.e African civilizations and South American civilizations) and had equal rights playing whatever role they wanted in society. A society is meant to work as a whole including ALL people and without them it will fall. I do not identify as one of those stupid victim seeking feminists, but women have always played important roles in society, so maybe you should learn more about the things you use everyday that women invented.",

You’re such an airhead asking if mathematicians did, do you know the many different jobs people have from math. How would you do your taxes or get your pensions, someone with a math major has to do that. As well as the many physicists who work in many different jobs. My mother was an engineer for GE for 30 years making planes and cars, you know what that took, math.

IT WAS AND IT IS STILL MEN!  It was men who explored the wilderness, it was men who tamed the world to make it safe also for their women and children, it was men who constructed the required infrastructures and technostructues to lay down the foundation of the industrial revolution. It was men who patrolled and manned the fortified outposts of the Wild West and the Silk Road, it was men who defended the borders and patrolled the rivers from the time of Sumeria to the time of Ancient Rome and it was even continued during the Age of Voyages to the New World and the Age of Discovery. \n\nIt is only after men has tamed so much of the world (and fought each other that forged the military technologies that was later used for civilian peaceful purposes) that women were able to SAFELY participate in society. We men BLASTED THE WORLD TO TAME IT and now you indiscriminate against us after you are given a chance to participate in society. GET OUT OF YOUR SHELTERED LIFE AND FACE THE REALITIES OF HISTORY'S FACTS AND LOGIC. FACTS AND LOGIC ARE THE ENEMIES OF FEMINISTS-FEMINAZIS LIKE YOU. Ungrateful women who took the brainwashing wave of the women's movement in their teens and 20s and then coming to Dennis Prager with all of them saying \"I wish never made that decision\" and had a loving family now. Don't belive me? Call up Dennis Prager\" and check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLqHv0xgOlc&t=3s  Published on May 22, 2013\nFeminists and other leftists are useful idiots who serve only to destabilise the society. When the goal is reached, they will be \"lined up against the wall\". 1984 interview with a former KGB agent and Soviet diplomat, Yuri Bezmenov.\n\nWHEN I WAS A YOUNG KGB OFFICER DURING THE COLD WAR I ASK A PSYCHOLOGIST WHY IS IT THAT EVEN THE MOST MEDIOCRE MEN HAS THIS TENDENCY TO TURN INTO NEAR GENIUS OR TOTALLY GENIUS ONLY DURING IN TIMES OF WAR AS DEMONSTRATED TIME AND AGAIN THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND DURING WW I AND WW II AND HIS ANSWER IS BECAUSE MEN ARE LONG TERM THINKERS AND WAR IS A LONG TERM PROGRAM REQUIRING FAST THINKING AND HIGHLY PATTERNED ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES OF DUTY FUNCTIONS AND FAST READING AND COMPREHENSION AND ANALYSIS OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DATA GATHERING ACCOMPANIED WITH SWIFT REACTION-REFLEXES ON WHAT TO PLAN AND DO THE NEXT MOMENT. THIS MOTIVATES MEN TO BECOME FAST LEARNERS AND FAST DATA ASSIMILATORS TO CONNECT THE DOTS IN THE RIGHT PATTERN AFTER BEING FORCED TO LEARN TO SELECT WHICH DOTS OF INFORMATION MUST BE SELECTED FIRST! \n\nQUITE IRONIC THAT IT IS WAR AND ONLY DURING A WAR TIME PERIOD THAT MEN HAS THAT TENDENCY TO EXCEL. AND ONE WOMAN PSYCHOLOGIST SAID IT ALSO BECAUSE MEN EVOLVED FROM THAT HUNTER-GATHERER SURVIVALIST FOUNDATION THAT REQUIRES FAST LEARNING AND FAST THINKING AND FAST PERMANENT MEMORIZATION AND FAST COMPREHENSION OF THE SITUATIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES FROM ONE MOMENT TO THE NEXT. A women psychologist during the Cold War said that to me. By the way, that woman psychologist is a KGB officer involved in psychological warfare conducted against American, targeting American women with all sorts of women's movement brainwashing techniques. That was way back in the late 1950s and early 1960s. And you Eva Bukhryakova happened to be in it's way and became it's victim either directly or indirectly through our creations that we did through a 2sd Party which are the Rockefeller Foundation and others whose weaknesses for money we exploited for our brainwashing operations against the American women. Destroy American womanhood you destroy wifehood and motherhood, you destroy that you destroy the American family, destroy the American family you destroy American society, you destroy America society you destroy the American military which is now facing A LOT OF PROBLEMS BEING COVERED UP BY THE LEFTIST-LIBERAL MEDIA AND BY THE PENTAGON. And we KGB won the psychological warfare! Which is why many retired KGB women involved in psychological warfare are LAUGHING AT WOMEN AT YOU, LOL, BECAUSE YOU FELL INTO THE TRAPS THAT THEY CREATED FOR YOU Eva Bukhryakova! LOL!\n\nTHIS IS THE BASIS AND FOUNDATION OF SOVIET ERA EDUCATION FOR ALL RUSSIAN MEN. WE CREATED A CURRICULUM BASED ON THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL FINDINGS, TESTED THEM, IRON OUT THE KINKS, REFINE THEM, AND CREATED AN ACADEMIC SYSTEM BASED ON THE MALE'S BRAIN'S THINKING PATTERNS AND THINKING ATTITUDES. \n\nTHE RESULT? A VAST RESERVOIR OF SCIENTIFIC, ENGINEERING, ANDTECHNICAL TALENT COMPOSED LARGELY OF MEN. AS FOR THE WOMEN WE CREATED A CURRICULUM BASED ON THE FEMALE'S BRAIN'S THINKING PATTERN. THAT IS WHY EVEN THOUGH SCHOOLS ACCOMMODATES BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, THEIR CURRICULUM IS DIFFERENT, THAT IS IF ONE LOOKS VERY HARD FOR THE DIFFERENCES.\nShow less\nReply        \n\nNAMET IPSA2 months ago\ni know but a lie is easier to accept hence too many intellectually poor and hateful ppl like BLM, SJW's, Feminazis\nReply",

AND RADICAL FEMINIST EXTREMISTS OPENLY CREATED AN UNFAIR CURRICULUM THAT FAVORS ONLY THE FEMALE BRAIN THINKING PATTERN WHILE INDISCRIMINATING AGAINST THE MALE BRAIN THINKING PATTERN BY UNFAIRLY GIVING AND DIVERTING MORE RESOURCES TO MEET THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF GIRLS AND WOMEN WHILE NEGLECTING AND IGNORING THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF BOYS AND MEN WHICH ARE WHOLISTICALLY AND OUTRIGHT DIFFERENT FROM GIRLS AND WOMEN. \n\nI feel that all teachers should see this. As a young boy, especially in elementary, boys were treated like autistic shits, while girls were treated like royalty, and would always be used as a demonstration on what boys should act like. \n\nBoys only like to read action, attention grabbing books and are deliberately deprived of such books as a silent policy to indiscriminate against boys and men so that they are literally being destroyed psychologically and being destroyed intellectually because they are not being given books that are boys and men oriented but instead they are being INDISCRIMINATED IN A SUBTLE WAY BY THE FUCKING FEMINIST ANTI-MALE FEMALE MANHATING WOMEN WHO SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE TEACHERS OR EDUCATORS IN ANY WAY AND NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE TEACHERS OR EDUCATORS IN ANY INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING IN THE FIRST PLACE! BUT THE ANTI-MALE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT (CREATED BY US KGB) WILL ALWAYS USE LIES OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS BY LYING AND FALSELY ACCUSING SELF-DEFENDING MALE TEACHERS AND MALE STUDENTS OF BEING BIASED AND INDISCRIMINATORY AGAINST GIRLS AND WOMEN EVEN THOUGH THESE STUPID AND BRAINWASHED MAN HATER WOMEN TEACHERS AND WOMEN'S MOVEMENT KNOWS THAT THEY ARE THEMSELVES WHO ARE THE LIARS AND NOT THE MEN AND BOYS WHO ARE JUST DEFENDING THEIR RIGHTS TO EQUAL TREATMENT \"AS MEN AND BOYS\" AND THEY DESERVED NOT TO BE TREATED AS WOMEN AND GIRLS BUT AS MEN AND BOYS!\n\nGirls tend to be interested in more things than boys, hence why boys only like to read action, attention grabbing books. Girls obviously will score higher in reading since they are given books that interest them, rather than boys that can't focus on books that girls like. I remember in 5th grade when my teacher made our class read \"fever\" which is about a girl that grew up during the time of the yellow fever. The girls finished the book by the end of lunch time, while the boys struggled to read it for weeks. If my teacher would of assigned two different books to different genders (YES, there are only 2), then they wouldn't have had the problem. Because of that book, I had to take a test on it which would base my level of reading to get in 6th grade. By the beginning of 6th grade, we found out what our scores were. Every individual boy scored at LEAST a 78, while the girls scored around 90-100. This is unfair and in result of that, (I am currently in 8th grade), I wasn't able to get into the honors class that specific year, which meant that for the duration I am in middle school (which I still am) I had to be put in average classes, in which I should of been out in honors, since I am gifted (I have an IQ of 146). The average classes pace is drastically too slow for me to follow, and I usually end up when asked a question, explaining far too more than a simple answer. This is unfair and because of poor decisions teachers made in elementary, it will affect the lives and future of the students (especially boys). I will have to stay in average classes until next year, when we will be doing an other placement test, where hopefully I will be assigned a book that I can stay focused on, and get into a good high school. ALL teachers must see this, to know how their students depend on their actions they make previously, to see how it can change the lives and future of the students. Please acknowledge this. And now, they are openly and deliberately indiscriminating against boys and young men even from vocational trade schools and openly turning them away from learning and hands on career workshops WHICH IS AN OUTRIGHT ACT OF INDISCRIMINATION AGAINST BOYS AND MEN AND WHICH SHOULD BE REPORTED TO THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES WHO ARE UNFORTUNATELY INDISCRIMINATING ALSO AGAINST BOYS AND MEN AND TURNING THEM AWAY FROM ALL SOURCES OF LEARNING THAT BOYS AND MEN MUST NOW RESORT IN FORMING THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT BOYS-MEN LEARNING CLUBS TO FORM THEIR OWN PRIVATE learning and hands on career workshops and career events featuring mechanics and welding learning vocational school clubs. IF THEY INDISCRIMINATE AGAINST BOYS AND MEN, THEN BOYS AND MEN HAS THE RIGHT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST ALL FORMS OF ANTI-MALE GENDER INDISCRIMINATION BY USING ALL DEENSIVE METHODS AND COUNTER-OFFENSIVE POLICIES IN ALL PLACES OF WORK AND STUDY AND THAT IS THEIR RIGHTS TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST THESE BRAINWASHED WOMEN-FEMINAZISTS AND RADICAL FEMINISTS EXTREMISTS! And more than that, men are the ones who created civilizations, expanded their borders, administered their empires, send armies of explorers and patrols and outposts stations along the roads they created, to do this they created writing, mathematics, science, governmental organizational administrative structures, tamed the wilderness, send rotating patrols to guard the frontiers and the lands and rivers and seas under their dominions and all these requires logistical knowledge, the creation of military tactics and strategies, engineering knowledge was developed for the need to build fortifications and public works and irrigation networks and water networks and sewage networks, metallurgical knowledge was created for better farm implements and weapons and fortifications, and many others too many to mention here and ALL OF THESE WERE CREATED AND INVENTED AND EXPOUNDED UPON AND IMPROVED UPON BY MEN. From the brains of these men are born the greatest civilizations of the world like Sumeria, Babylon, Persia, Ebla, Troy, Greece, Rome, Parthia, the Chinese Dynasties, the Empire of Japan. It is only when the world at the start of the 1900 has been thoroughly explored, mapped, tamed, outpost constructed, and professional men rotated on their duties based on the calendars and time keeping technologies they have developed to help administer the world that women now has time enough to devote time to their studies that their i.q started to slowly rise because of all the intelligent works of men THAT TAMED AND CIVILIZED THE WORLD FOR THEM WHICH MEANS THE USE OF UNLIMITED MALE BRAIN POWER TO CREATE ALL OF THAT! And then they have the time to create their women's movements in the 20th century which was hijacked by the NWO who wanted to destroy the family by destroying the men gradually through the use of the unspoken and unwritten policy of equality through inequality against the men and at the expense of men until the 80s and 90s that schools run by biased radicalized liberals extremists are deliberately neglecting the needs of boys and men in education and unfairly pouring more resources to meet the needs of girls and women at the expense of boys and men, instead of equalizing the sharing of resources they are unfairly diverting more resources to the females at the expense of the males which can be explained in the book \"The War Against Boys\" and they are doing it in the name of equality through inequality when in fact anyone who is unbiased can see that they are doing it in the name of inequality at the expense of the boys and men's academic educational needs. All these things started with co-education in order to destroy the established educational systems patterned and based after the male thinking patterns and attitudes toward education and then applying the female systems on the males which caused a lot of havoc in the form of higher drop outs and academic discouragements and academic hardships. For it is like trying to fit a circle in a square which creates empty gaps of spaces and those empty gaps of spaces are the deliberately created academic gaps and vacuums created to deliberately make the education of the boys and men incomplete and completely sabotaged. We former KGB-GRU/FSB officers saw all of these happening and recorded it and sent reports to Moscow. We could have made it public to the American public to the parents of these boys and men but we did not because of the Cold War. Anything that can be used as a weapon will be used as a weapon. In fact, we inserted ourselves in the NWO's agencies and foundations to plant seeds of destructive policies but in a very subtle and indirect way so as to make the NWO that they are the ones who created these policies even though it is us who created these policies in the first place.",

By LYING AND FALSELY saying that they do not belong in college schools or universities BUT ONLY AFTER THEY, THE RADICAL FEMINISTS-FEMINAZIS HAS DESTROYED THEM GRADUALLY IN THE PAST MANY DECADES IN A VERY GRADUAL AND SUBTLE WAY SO AS NOT TO RAISE SUSPICIONS FROM THE PARENTS OF THE MALE STUDENTS AND FROM THE MALE STUDENTS OR THERE WILL BE A MASSIVE EXPOSE PROTESTS AGAINST THE EVIL RADICAL FEMINISTS-FEMINAZIS WOMEN WHO WILL BE FORCED TO CONFESS THEIR EVIL HIDDEN NEFARIOUS ANTI-BOYS/ANTI-MEN AGENDA AS EXPOSED BY  Christina Hoff Sommers in her book \"THE WAR AGAINST BOYS\" (AND MEN).\n\nChristina Hoff Sommers in her book \"THE WAR AGAINST BOYS\" (AND MEN) WHICH EXPOSES THE EVIL AND HIDDEN NEFARIOUS ANTI-BOYS/ANTI-MEN EVIL EDUCATIONAL POLICY AGAINST THEM IN ORDER TO SABOTAGE AND DENIGRATE AND DEGRADE THEIR INHERENT ACADEMIC HIGHER INTELLIGENCE AND PROFICIENCY (SINCE IT WAS US MALES, BOYS AND MEN WHO CARVED OUT CIVILIZATION OUT OF THE WILDERNESS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND NASA ALSO HAS PROVEN THAT ALL CHILDREN WERE BORN GENUISES) through an evil radical feminists-feminazis highjacked academic educational system and it's curriculum in order to destroy it's meritocracy system that \"FAVORS NO ONE\" and feminized the educational system so as to DELIBERATELTY MAKE IT UNNECESSARILY DIFFICULT FOR BOYS AND MEN IN GRADE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL TO STUDY. \n\nChristina Hoff Sommers in her book \"THE WAR AGAINST BOYS\" (AND MEN) WHICH EXPOSES THE EVIL AND HIDDEN NEFARIOUS ANTI-BOYS/ANTI-MEN EVIL EDUCATIONAL POLICY AGAINST THEM IN ORDER TO SABOTAGE AND DENIGRATE AND DEGRADE THEIR INHERENT ACADEMIC HIGHER INTELLIGENCE AND PROFICIENCY (SINCE IT WAS US MALES, BOYS AND MEN WHO CARVED OUT CIVILIZATION OUT OF THE WILDERNESS IN THE FIRST PLACE) She, Christina Hoff Sommers in her book \"THE WAR AGAINST BOYS\" (AND MEN) has also exposed the EVIL AND INDIRECT AND SUBTLE ATTACK BY A CLOSET EVIL RADICAL FEMINIST-FEMINAZI CALLED HANNA ROSIN WHO WROTE AN EVIL PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTACKING WARFARE AGAINST BOYS AND MEN CALLED The Decline Of Men and the rise of women and attaching a lot of evil lying explanations and evil lying reasons and evil twisted artificial facts and evil twisted artifical explanations and evil twisted artificial statistics which are backed by a series of evil artficially created conditions-situations-circumstances in the past created by their WAR AGAINST BOYS AND MEN IN THE ACADEMIC WORLD SINCE THEEARLY1970s whose sole purpose was to sabotage-degrate-denigrate-and psychologically discourage boys and men from developing their REAL FULL INTELLECTUAL POTENTIALS. \n\nAnd then this closet evil feminist-feminazi man-hater pretender evilly tried to evilly validate her false and lying points and lying point of views against boys and men in a subtle-indirect and deceiving way so as not to cause offense and also to raise suspicions about her OUTRIGHT LIES AGAINST BOYS AND MEN IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY HER FALSE STATEMENTS AND OUTRIGHT LIES THAT (FALSELY LYING) MEN AND BOYS NEED TO ADAPT TO ACCEPT HER LIES AND ACCEPT HER DECEPTIONS TO WRONGLY ACCEPT  THEIR FALSE-WRONG PLACE IN LIFE TO WHICH/IN WHICH THEY DO NOT BELONG AND FALSE ARTIFICIAL LOWERED STATUS WHICH IS NOT TRUE AT ALL FOR IT IS ALL DECEPTIONS OF HER TO DESTROY US ALL MEN AND BOYS.\n\nAnd to discourage and prevent us from investigating her false claims and lies which she is evilly lying right straight through her fucking teeth because we know she is lying and she knows that we men and boys knew from the start that she is lying. And that is EVIL HANNA ROSIN'S  greatest fear that she will be exposed as a liar and a deceiver because all of her false facts and false evidences and false proofs and false statistics are all false creations created during the \"WAR AGAINST BOYS (AND MEN\" which is a deliberate sabotaging-indiscriminating operation(s) aganst young boys and men in the past up to the present which they are hiding from the public because once the parents of their sons anf the uncles of their nephews and older well educated cousins of their younger cousins saw the evil deliberate sabotaging-indiscriminating operation(s) aganst young boys and men in the past up to the present, this will create a backlash against all women academicians and women educators and women movements and women organizations on a large nationwide scale! \n\nThese lying and evil feminists-feminazis will be severely punished by the full forceful brunt of male intellectual and physical strength to hammer them down. And men and boys will start making demands that the MERITOCRACY ACADEMIC SYSTEM THAT FAVORS NO ONE  MUST BE RESTORED REGARDLESS OF THE CONSEQUENCES FROM THE DERANGED PROTESTS OF THE BRAINWASHED-DUMBED DOWN MILLENNIALS, X AND Y GENERATION AND OLDER BRAINWASHED OLD HAG RADICAL FEMINISTS-FEMINAZIS. AND HANNAH ROSIN WILL BE HUNTED DOWN AND HARRASSED AS PART OF HER PUNISHMENT AND BE OSTRACIZED AND CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTS OF INDIRECT-SUBTLE SABOTAGING INDISCRIMINATION-DENIGRATION-DEGRADATION-BRAINWASHING-AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTACKS OF EVILLY CONDITIONING EVILLY BRAINWASHING EVILLY ATTACKS AGAINST THE MALE PSYCHE OF YOUNG BOYS AND MEN IN ORDER TO SABOTAGE THEIR REAL INHERENT GENIUS AND INBORN GENIUS THAT THEY WERE BORN WITH AS THEY WERE CONCEIVED AND BORN INTO THIS WORLD! But was unfortunately victimized by the evil feminists-feminazis brainwashing/dumbing down/deception/psychological subtle-indirect attacks as a desperate attempt to sabotage-destroy-degrade-denigrate their inherent male genius in them and to psychologically condition themto be easily deceived into wrongly accepting their falsely-wrongly placed status-fate that they do not belong to for ALL BOYS AND MEN BELONGS TO THE TOP OF THE WORLD IN INTELLECTUAL ACHIVEMENTS AND GENIUS STATUS AT ALL TIMES PAST THROUGH THE END OF TIME!\n\nThe proof lies in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hongkong, and Singapore WHERE THE MERITOCRACY-BASED ACADEMIC EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT FAVORS NO ONE IS STILL IN EFFECT AND IN FORCE AND PRODUCES BOYS AND MEN OF GREAT INTELLECTUAL CAPABILITIES, ABILITIS, AND PROWES AND ACADEMIC ACHIVEMENTS BYPASSING THAT OF THEIR WOMEN FOR THE MOST PART ALL THE TIME!\n\nIf no one belives me that I am telling the truth, THEN ALL THESE FUCKING DEMONIC FEMINISTS-FEMINAZIS ALL HAVE TO DO IS BUY A 2-WAY TICKET TO THESE NATIONS, STAY THERE FOR 2 TO 3 YEARS AND NEUTRALLY INVESTIGATE EVERYTHING ON A NON-RAMDOM/NO CHERRY PICKING BASIS. \n\nAND I KNOW THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT THAT CHALLENGE FOR THE PRSENCE OF PROOFS AND IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCES FOUND IN THOSE NATIONS WILL JUST SIMPLY EXPOSED THEIR LIES, DECEPTIONS, DECEIVING NATURE, AND LYING NATURE.

        "commentText": "+Steve M I just want to ask this question. How did they feminized education and how did the feminists or feminazis worked hard to change the physics curriculum that unfairly benefited only girls and indiscriminates against boys, how did they do it? And how did they openly made changes to disadvantage boys in order to unfairly give all the advantage to girls which is GENDER INDISCRIMINATION IN ACTION AGAINST BOYS?&#160; Could you explain it to me in it&#39;s complete entierty, detail by detail, like creating a blue print of the nefarious plans?&#160; And the men who work in education who are too frightened to openly argue this gender indiscrimination against boys because they might lose promotion prospects, could they also help in giving me the details on how these very destructive sexist anti-male gender feminazis are doing it?&#160; And my advice to for you to write a highly detailed book about it with physical evidences in the form of documents, curriculum plans, textbook changes compared to past textbooks in the 80s and 70s and 60s and add also the information by these men who are also working in education. And my advice is, why not at the same time, create in secret a parallel curriculum and textbooks by using the curriculum and textbooks of the past early 80s, and 70s, and 60s, and 50s, and 40s. The reason why I want to know and help you is because I was once a former officer of the Cold War of which I dare not mention too much and I have seen and notice a lot too. But since I am already retired and too old to travel I can only offer advice: Create in secret a parallel curriculum and textbooks using the past curriculum and textbooks of the past decades as mentioned above, especially the 60s and 50s and 40s and 30s and upgrade them if necessary without making almost any changes at all so as not to lose the gist of their lessons. And make duplicate copies of them and hide them in a safe place. Then use a tactic called flanking movement wherein you will introduce just one set of copy through a second party in an another school where logic and sanity still prevail. Make sure that the school is safe enough to introduce them, and are run by sane men and women who knows what is really is going on which is MALE GENDER INDISCRIMINATION AGAINST BOYS AND YOUNG MEN IN EDUCATION. You can contact me through youtube provided youtube does not censor your messages for youtube seems to be under the control,of self-hating feminized men and by feminazis. And what would you do to stop and reversed the feminized education in the U.K? How would you do it? How about creating a blue print, a kind of battle plan against this UNFAIRNESS AND INDISCRIMINATION AGAINST BOYS AND YOUNG MEN IN U.K EDUCATION IN ALL LEVELS. How to re-engineer the educational system in favor of boys need and young mens needs without indiscriminating against the females who were unfairly given more attention to their needs while neglecting the needs of the males who needs equal attention also.",

And all of these are fuelled by these fucking rabid, radical feminist radicals who are mostly jewish women and gentile women collaborators who are brainwashed by their jewish counterparts. \n\nThe National Organization for Women is into everything in your America for the power because they are there only for the power and money, nothing more. They are not after equality through equality but THEY ARE ONLY AFTER EQUALITY THROUGH INEQUALITY BY INDISCRIMINATING AGAINST MEN AND BOYS, RE-ENGINEERING AND RE-WRITING AND RIGGING THE CURRICULUM TO FAVOR ONLY GIRLS  AND NOT TO FAVOR BOYS SO THAT THEY MAKE SURE THAT THE BOYS WILL BE MADE TO FAIL ACADEMICALLY BECAUSE THE SCHOOL'S CURRICULUM IS RIGGED AGAINST THEM AND THAT IS WHAT WE CALL CHEATING BEING COMMITTED BY THESE RABID RADICAL FEMINISTS EXTREMISTS. \n\nAND WE RUSSIAN KGB, ESPECIALLY THE WOMEN KGB OFFICERS, ARE WONDERING WHY IS IT THE MEN AND THE MOTHERS OF THESE BOYS ARE NOT PROTESTING AND INVESTIGATING THE CURRICULUM OF THE SCHOOLS THAT THEIR BOYS AND MEN ARE ENROLLED INTO?\n\nARE THE WOMEN OF AMERICA SO BRAINWASHED THAT THEY CAN NOT SEE THE OBVIOUS DIFFERENCES WHICH IS A RED FLAG SAYING THEY ARE DELIBERATELY RIGGING THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TO SYSTEMATICALLY DUMBED-DOWN AND BRAINWASH THE BOYS AND MEN IN SCHOOLS TO DELIBERATELY MAKE THEM FAIL AND AT THE SAME TIME TO DISCOURAGE THEM FROM GOING INTO COLLEGE? \n\nJUST LOOK AT THE EDUCATIONAL ADVERTISEMENTS, PRACTICALLY ALL OF THEM SHOWS ONLY GIRLS AND WOMEN BEING ENCOURAGED TO GO TO COLLEGE WHILE GIVING A SUBLIMINAL MESSAGE TO YOUNG BOYS AND MEN THAT YOU ARE NOT FIT FOR COLLEGE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE FIT FOR COLLEGE BUT ARE BEING SET-UP TO FAIL SO AS TO GIVE A FALSE IMPRESSION THAT THEY ARE FALSELY NOT FIT FOR COLLEGE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE FIT FOR COLLEGE PROVIDED THEY WERE NOT CHEATED EDUCATIONALLY FROM THE TIME THEY ENTER SCHOOL TO THE TIME THEY FINNISH HIGH SCHOOL. \n\nALL OF THESE STARTED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF CO-EDUCATIONAL PROPAGANDA TO DISCOURAGE A SEPARATE GENDER SCHOOLS FROM BEING EXPANDED AND TO DESTROY THE SEPARATE GENDER SCHOOLS WHICH HAS BEEN A SUCCESS SINCE THE 70S, 60S, WAY BACK TO 1900!\n\nTHIS IS A SET-UP TO PAVE THE WAY FOR GENDER INDISCRIMINATION AGAINST BOYS AND MEN IN EDUCATION IN ALL LEVELS OD EDUCATION IN ELEMENTARY LEVELS, HIGH SCHOOL LEVELS, AND COLLEGE LEVELS.\n\nHOW DID WE KNOW?

Richard Flynn, Dr. Rushton, Dr Nyborg,etc.",
