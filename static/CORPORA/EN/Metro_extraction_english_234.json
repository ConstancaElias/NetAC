        "postText": "A rainbow road crossing made up of colours of the Gay Pride flag has been unveiled in London.', 'The crossing outside Brockwell Park in Herne Hill has been installed by Lambeth council to \u2018show solidarity with the LGBT+ community\u2019.', 'It is the first permanent pride crossing in the UK and follows in the footsteps of other major cities including Vancouver, Sydney and Paris.', 'People are being encouraged to share images on social media with the hashtags #WeAreLambeth and #HerneHillRainbow.', 'Homophobic and transphobic hate crime has more than doubled in England and Wales over five years.', 'The rate of crimes against LGBTQ people have risen by 144 per cent from 2013/14 to 2017/18, according to analysis by the Guardian.', 'At the end of May, two women were attacked on a London bus for refusing to kiss in front of a group of men.', 'The mayor of Lambeth, Councillor Ibrahim Dogus, said the crossing was a way to stand in solidarity with those facing discrimination.', 'Councillor Sonia Winifred, Cabinet member for equalities and culture, said: \u2018We have a tradition of championing equality and LGBT+ rights \u2014 this crossing celebrates that and is an example of our bold and progressive thinking. We\u2019ve come a long way and Lambeth is proud to be leading the way.\u2019', 'A temporary rainbow crossing was set up in Totnes, Devon, in 2017 by social enterprise Proud2Be.', 'But plans to make it permanent were blocked by local councillors in November over concerns the markings could be seen as \u2018ambiguous\u2019.",

Give harsher punishments for perpetrato<b> rs of homop</b>hobic crimes (well, any crimes really for that matter) if you want to show solidarity. But when I'm crossing the road I just want to get across it safely. I'm not going to feel any more safer because I'm walking on a rainbow.It's not even like I think they shouldn't have done it or it's a bad thing, I'm just asking what the need is. It doesn't help in any way other than help people cross the road which is what normal zebra crossings do anyway.",
