We who are mixed blood NATIVE AMERICAN, why should we care about those who turned their backs on us. In a few generations the majority of our population will be mixed blood NATIVE AMERICAN. You the government and tribes have stabbed us in the back. You are responsible for the genocidal act of 1985. You bite the hand that today would feed you and protect you from the genocidal politicians, Latinos and Muslims. The are out to continue genocide upon us. MANAA or MAKE AMERICA NATIVE AMERICAN AGAIN is our only option. Close the border. Send illegal invaders and their children back to where they came from.

However being adopted you feel disassociated, you feel like you have no where you can belong, no way to identify yourself. However like many I did 23&Me and was able to get in contact with half siblings who have answers. To be told it still doesn't matter, your 16.4% quantum is not enough to be recognized as a part of something bigger a part of recognition to your heritage destroys someone who is desperate to cling onto some fourm of culture identity. Then to be unacknowledged by those who view you less than them at a Powwow deters us minority with a lower percentage from wanting to learn further, from wanting to attend powwows and from trying to meet those with same heritage to understand their roots. Tell me how does a casted aside child now an adult who finds they have 16% + quantum but below required to be acknowledged they should feel, they were never accept by the white mans culture of the adopted family. What place is there on this earth, what cultural identity through a people that their great grandparents who refuse to accept or acknowledge them for the small 16.4%. They loose out on a chance to learn and help make a difference in their Tribal contributions because of quantum bias that is a fourm of <b> ethnic </b>discrimination of your own people who are the future but aren't good enough in the tribes eyes and that is how we loose to the white man with every discrimination rejection and refuse to accept those who are half breed as you call those lesser or hybrid with even less quantum it breaks my heart. Soon we will loose out on quantum, what then, will you then accept and acknowledge us as brothers and sisters despite the small % when it comes to saving our heritage and our people.",

            "commentText": "\"Unless Native American, you came from somewhere else\" (Barrack Obama).The truth of the matter is that indigenous Native People would forever be the subject of scapegoat, and victimized by the Colonizers of their lands, as long as they occupy those rich bountiful lands in order to justify their occupation. In other word, the Colonizers, are 'Living in Denial'. That is what is all about, and the rest is the history. Besides, indigenous Native people in Colonized lands of Anglo British and Spaniard are more of the same. Kill the indigenous natives and whoever is left, marginalize them and create artificial poverty, once that poverty becomes crime and drinking, the media points to the poor and blames them to continue to stigmatize the 'other' community, scumbags, etc. Do you know the fact that Indigenous Native people had built such great civilizations as Mayan, Inca and Aztec without outside help, and all from the scratch, and all on their own, since they had been cut off from the rest of the world for ten of thousand of years. In other words, they actually are great and proud people. All they need is their beloved fatherlands back, the lands that their ancestors forebearers had lived through thick and <b> thin,</b> endured through hardships of all sorts. Moreover, the hidden mega genocide of indigenous Native American population in continents of America 500 yrs ago was around 15 millions, while European population in Europe was around 20 millions. Today, Native population at 15 million, while European population , in continents of America + Europe, at a staggering 'ONE BILLION'! For instance, 200 years ago in U.S.A, around 3 million Germans came, and now there are 65 millions German-Americans; while 150 years ago, around 2 millions Irish came, and now there are 45 million Irish-Americans. While 500 years ago there were estimated 5 to 6 millions indigenous Native Americans in U.S.A, before Christopher Columbus arrived, today there are only around 2 million indigenous Native Americans survived. Imagine what would it be like today if Native American people had possessed some sort of nuclear weapons to defend themselves? The answer is they would still have their own beloved fatherlands, plus their population comparable to that of European population. I've no doubt about that. In my humble opinion, it's about time to decolonize the Colonized lands, and return it to rightful owners Native American people. Remember, notorious global cardinal crimes such as Slavery and Colonialism had long been over, why on earth is this another notorious Colonization still lingering on?

It's an insult to call us 'native Americans' when we predate the concept of 'America'. \n\nOf course the tribes in central and South America will be darker than those further up north in Canada and Alaska because they're closer to the equator. Skin color is an adaptive trait. \n\nOnly Inuits are considered East Asians aka neo mongoloids, they came during the last wave and you can find them on both sides of the Bering strait. We see each other as a different people, they have a raw diet like other East Asians, but we still come from the same source population.",

Our type of warfare was different, we fought for individual prestige not as an army, and it was better to count coup on an enemy then to kill him. White people be like: 'I acknowledge the genocide of the 'indigenous people' but the tribes were constantly at war so what's the big deal'.",

I would suggest the rest of my brothers and sisters go around the US too! I love going to different reservations now in Alabama and Florida. But the true testimony of our broad cultures is evident in every tribe, that is that we miss home and always have to go home. I recognized that just like our close relatives the Makah, every native <b> nation </b>feels that we belong to this earth...the earth does not belong to us. You begin to miss it, and talk to it like it's our cousins. It's an amazing feeling. Even more strange is my father was French, I spent a fairly equal amount of time between the 2 countries,  but I do not miss France. I do not miss the people. It's not home. Truly, that fact is an obvious genetic link to my people. \u2764",

And these ppl could never pass for a<b>  African</b>!!!!\n\n\nBut therein lies a puzzle: \"Modern Native Americans closely resemble people of China, Korea, and Japan\u2026 but the oldest American skeletons do not,\" says archaeologist and paleontologist James Chatters, lead author on the study and the owner of Applied Paleoscience, a research consulting service based in Bothell, Washington.\nThe small number of early American specimens discovered so far have smaller and shorter faces and longer and narrower skulls than later Native Americans, more closely resembling the modern people of Africa, Australia, and the South Pacific. \"This has led to speculation that perhaps the first Americans and Native Americans came from different homelands,\" Chatters continues, \"or migrated from Asia at different stages in their evolution.\"",

Available genetic data show that the Clovis people are the direct ancestors of roughly 80% of all living Native American populations in North and South America, with the remainder descended from ancestors who entered in later waves of migration.  As reported in February 2014, DNA from the 12,600-year-old remains of Anzick boy, found in Montana, has affirmed this connection to the peoples of the Americas. In addition, this DNA analysis affirmed genetic connections back to ancestral peoples of northeast Asia. This adds weight to the theory that peoples migrated across a land bridge from Siberia to North America.  Known as \"Clovis First\", the predominant hypothesis among archaeologists in the latter half of the 20th century had been that the people associated with the Clovis culture were the first inhabitants of the Americas. The primary support for this was that no solid evidence of pre-Clovis human habitation had been found. According to the standard accepted theory, the Clovis people crossed the Beringia land bridge over the Bering Strait from Siberia to Alaska during the period of lowered sea levels during the ice <b> age,</b> then made their way southward through an ice-free corridor east of the Rocky Mountains in present-day Western Canada as the glaciers retreated.  I like the Oshara Tribe, though, but that was a couple after Clovis.   Siberia would be just west of the middle of Russia.  Taken from:  [LINK] ",

She don't even know why!  just like most lefts just follow the other. Her & Madonna needs to stay away & go back to Hollyweird . come on Natives are you so bloody helpless you let any one who thinks they are \n someone come listen to the poor Indians?? She does not really give a crap about you! Just one of Hilary 's dogs. Natives need to stay away from the leftists. Stand on your own. Stop letting these people know how desperate you are! its just a way for Natives to side with them & to get your votes. If she was there just to listen about the people's culture OK. But lately all they do is go back and tell everyone that Natives want want want. They start to believe all Natives are worthless& cannot help themselves.\nWhich of course is BS. \nThis country needs a good leader and its not the Dems..sorry but they are not all crazed just most.\nWake up.",

Because of what our ancestors did long ago or because corporate America?

Because all Native Tribes have internalized what the government has called us. Even I myself call my tribe Navajo. Yes that is not what we call our tribe. We are Dineh which means The People \u270a\ud83c\udffd. I think it's hard to explain how we think and how we are assimilated so much. It's very complex part of our people. I felt sad too when they killed that Bison. But we have to keep our cultures strong. We lose that, then how will our people and culture exist. Thank you Chelsea.",

I personally believe in the whole land bridge thing, and I know I might get a lot of crap about that from some people. I honestly think we came from one continent but as time moved on and the continents moved apart, so did we. That's why I believe in the whole Land Bridge and <b> Mongoloid </b>thing, and that could explain why some Natives can be traced from Russia and China. I honestly find it so cool to learn about, and that's why I agree with you. I enjoy the similarities because I feel like it connects us to more groups of people from around the world!",

I suppose you're referring to the Dawes rolls and how white people paid $5 to be added to it in order to benefit being Native and getting land and whatnot...right? If you look it up, there were only 5 tribes that were apart of the Dawes Rolls. As of today in the U.S., there are 566 federally recognized tribes. There were only so many Native Americans who could have been a $5 <b> Indian.</b> Most other Natives are real, not FAKE. That is extremely disrespectful to claim based on their skin color. I also happen to believe South Americans are indigenous as well, along with every other person from Mexico to the tribes in Canada. Believe what you will, but that's my two cents.  Giga waabamin.",

Animal sacrifice to offer and to pray to ancestors, our love of nature, quiet and down to earth, the head hunting history, the skin color of that shade of brown, and facial features which I've seen from<b>  old</b> photos of Native Americans, much less now of course because of bi racial lineage, which is not wrong I have to say.  Almost like twins separated from each other,  the similarities are really very surprising an<b> d weir</b>d because we're not from the North or South American continent but from your opposite side of this planet.",

A lot of natives often claim those words for themselves in order to limit the hurt that they can inflict. I also think that if 99.9% of the world knows you as Blackfeet having to explain every time why that word is incorrect get's annoying. I found that the most respectful way to find out how to address them is to simply ask them what they prefer to be called. I am Anishinaabe, Pottowatomi, or Huron, if you call me one of those I will appreciate it a lot more then if you call me a<b> n india</b>n or a native american, because I am not from India and my ancestors were here way before people started calling this place America. This is just my view, there are a whole lot of natives out there that have different views, but I hope this helps.",

Cuz climate change is heating up the earth. All plants actually can feel pain. They have that sense you might've heard of, touch. LOL, I'm so shocked you think fruits and vegetables are the same as trees. It can be as big as some trees, but it's shape is similar to small plants. Have you never heard of the experiment where you let a plant listen to different music? The environment they're in determines how long they live.

And LOL, so, when you eat something like an orange and you smell that 'fresh fruit' smell, you realize that's a defense mechanism that a lot of fruits have to poison something? LOL, have you ever had a plant growing up? Most likely not because then you would know that reacting to the environment you're in, is a defense mechanism or an adaptation. Just because a plant can regenerate its limbs means you can kill it? LOL, so why is killing a snake bad? Plants can sense touch because most plants react specifically to touch. A calculator actually can have a touch sense because it senses the keys you're hitting and then reacting to it. And LOL, I meant that stuff like plants, animals, and humans have a life cycle, but ironically the things you listed Do have a life cycle as well. It's just not the same as everything else. Phones/Electronics have a life cycle because you can't use it without having to charge it at some point, can you? Once it 'dies,' can you continue using it? No. Not without charging it again. And dirt, seriously? You don't know anything, do you? Dirt actually comes from dead skill cells, dust, and sometimes secretions. It has a different life cycle just like phones. Dirt is actually the life source of some plants. How do you think dirt is formed? Magic? Dirt comes from basically dead things, but it actually can live. Soil, for example is full of life. Ever heard of microorganisms?? Water bottles actually do have a life cycle. It's called when it expires because all water actually can expire. Also, I'm not sure if mountains can die, but they do live. There's sometimes stripes of white or <b> red<b>  </b</b>>on a rock and depending on how many stripes it has, it can live for billions of years.\n\nJeez, did you lear<b> n nothin</b>g from school? And bananas are better than eating a chicken? LOL, you know that all fruits and vegetables are filled with GMO's, right? Wild bananas are actually poisonous. All fruits and vegetables are. Farmers genetically modified fruits and vegetables to make them edible. Not to mention the pesticides in them. So, remind me, if you raised a chicken yourself and killed it, How is that worse than eating genetically modified foods that will wind up killing you as well?\n\nI want to end processed factories for good and hunt the animals myself. Haha funny how the only edible wild fruits or vegetables you would have are small potatoes and a drop of corn.\n\nVegans and vegetarians are the worst. They claim their diet is good for you and don't know the first thing about what They eat.\n\nA living organism that shows no signs of 'life,' pain, or feeling, then why don't we eat humans like that, huh? Oh right! Cuz you're also a hypocrite. If you wanna say, 'Well, it basically doesn't have a life, let's eat it!' Then why not eat corpses, dirt, blood, brains, or anything like that? Cuz most things have lives. You just wanna kill anything that didn't have a face.\n\nJeez, I learned all this in middle school. H<b> ow o</b>ld are you that you have no clue that soil actually does live?? And most importantly, how plants can actually have kids. Not sure about vegetables, but fruits definitely have kids. LOL, wow, you don't know anything about plants. I'm a carnivore and I know more about what you eat than you do. I also know that all food is bad for you and it's because of these stupid factories. We're actually not supposed to eat that much, and drink only when we're thirsty. And so ironically, we're not able to digest corn, so there goes surviving on corn. If a carnivore knows more about what a vegetarian, or vegan is Actually eating, wow. Stay in school! PLEASE!!",

' Every people throughout history had laws and beneficial systems for their people, otherwise how could they survive ? ' first of all,  you have simple grammatical errors and a bad structure for a sentence. The second thing is, No, Native Americans did not have any type of laws or a system. That is just not true. Europeans weren't ruthless, they were just years ahead of them, intellectually more advanced, including their immunity to diseases which gave them a advantage over the Natives who were weak to foreign diseases. They were stuck in a time loop, doing the exact same thing for hundreds of years. They were not going to advance nowhere in this world, with their tribal warfare. \n\nEurope indeed did have tribal wars for a period of time. It wasn't to a extent as many other countries or continents. The Europeans advanced quite quickly and efficiently at a rapid rate, this is what made them stand apart from the rest. \n\nYou can't really say we all evolved globally. Continents like Africa, sad, but true. Haven't really provided anything to this world. Native Americans haven't provided anything to this world. Some have, like the Asians and parts in Asia or Europe really have the ultimate influence in the world. That is the simple truth.",

Your ancestors were savages. \n\nSome scientists believe North America was more violent than the European civilization that replaced it. War and violence was a global affair. The world was not at peace anywhere, that includes the North American Indians.\n\nNative Americans definitely waged war long before Europeans showed up. The evidence is especially strong in the American Southwest, where archaeologists have found numerous skeletons with projectile points embedded in them and other marks of violence; war seems to have surged during periods of drought. But scientists such as Pinker, Keeley and LeBlanc have replaced the myth of the noble savage with the myth of the savage savage.\n\n...\"quantitative body counts\u2014such as the proportion of prehistoric skeletons with ax marks and embedded arrowheads or the proportion of men in a contemporary foraging tribe who die at the hands of other men\u2014suggest that pre-state societies were far more violent than our own.\" According to Pinker, the 17th-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes \"got it right\" when he called pre-state life a \"war of all against all.\" Thanksgiving guilt trip: How warlike were Native Americans before Europeans showed up?\n\nHuman skeletons from as early as the Woodland Period (250 B.C. to A.D. 900) show occasional marks of violence, but conflict intensified during and after the thirteenth century, by which time farmers were well established in the Plains. After 1250, villages were often destroyed by fire, and human skeletons regularly show marks of violence, scalping, and other mutilations. Warfare was most intense along the Missouri River in the present-day Dakotas, where ancestors of the Mandans, Hidatsas, and Arikaras were at war with each other, and towns inhabited by as many as 1,000 people were often fortified with ditch and palisade defenses. Excavations at the <b> Crow </b>Creek site, an ancestral Arikara town dated to 1325, revealed the bodies of 486 people\u2013men, women, and children, essentially the town's entire population\u2013in a mass grave. These individuals had been scalped and dismembered, and their bones showed clear evidence of severe malnutrition, suggesting that violence resulted from competition for food, probably due to local overpopulation and climatic deterioration. Violence among farmers continued from the 1500s through the late 1800s. Encyclopedia of the Great Plains\n\nWars were fought to avenge the murders of kinsman, to plunder, to acquire slaves, acquire territory, and in the case of the Iroquois it took on the mystical. The specifics varied across the continent but war was a universal affair among the Native-Americans.",

I'm slowly learning how to speak because I feel it is so important to keep our language alive.

Similar to us, I understand that Europeans and Maori have intermarried for a long time so even those with some of the strongest ties to Maori culture are often partially European, perhaps unbeknownst to them. I first learned about the current state of the Maori people from reading about the history of the All Blacks as I originally thought the Polynesian looking players were Maori, until I discovered most were Samoan, or a combination of both. I really envy you guys in NZ. Maori culture seems so ingrained and celebrated across NZ, I wish it were that way here. Now, funny enough, I replied to one of TJ Perenara's tweets (I hope you know who he is) a long time ago which had something to do with Maori ancestry in NZ, and I asked how many full-blooded Maori there are left to which he surprisingly replied that he doesn't know any. Who knows if he's right or wrong but Google fails to provide any consensus objective answer to this question. Not that it really matters all that much as culture is what's truly important.",

I live in the South Island of New Zealand and have moved to different towns a lot and I feel like the South Island is way less cultured then the north island since I was born in the north.

In the South Island (or where I live) it isn't really that cool to do kapa Haka which is our traditional war dance you probably know\ud83d\ude02  I still do it though. But it is still really big in some places but it is really big in the north island. But we dont have it bad at all if you look at America and I just love the culture there and how similar it is to ours is <b> crazy.</b> We still try to incorporate it because most of the towns in New Zealand are Maori names but<b>  nobody</b> can say it right and you get laughed at for saying it right it annoys me\ud83d\ude02",

On mine it just says I'm a maori!!! But I know for a fact I'm not full blooded. My grandmother told me about my white man English connections, also my Dalmatian connections, with a little bit of <b> African </b>American and a tad sprinkle of Chinese... As you can see, this is by no means a family tree of a full-blooded Maori. In fact there's no full blood Maori left these days our blood is very mixed due to intermarriage with white people, so you get the drift!!!",

There are hundreds of tribes all different in Mexico.. I myself am Purepecha.. No relation to the mexica tribe..instead we were the most powerful tribe in the Americas defeating in battle 2 times the mexica which was the biggest native civilization in all of the Americas.. Now in all those centuries of living within similar lands to only battle 2 times shows how little native tribes went to war.. Anyway native Americas in Mexico speak Spanish because of colonialism just like native Americas in the USA speak English.. That doesn't mean because they speak English That makes them from England.. Really unintelligent statement. Either way when someone tries to insult our tribes just talk truth.. No need to insult him.. That's what the Europeans did to all native tribes.. We aren't like that my people.. We speak truth",

What is different about north America and south America is that, in South American European people had children with natives and a new \"<b> race\"</b> was created called \"mestizos.\" I am a \"mestizo.\" But I also called a \"latina\" by Caucasians. I speak Spanish and English  but also I understand Quechua which one of the many native language in South America.",

I mean rape is not super natural, so by definition natural and thus (unfortunately) part of the circle of life. But since this has <b> nothing </b>to do with my argument, let's put it this way: you would not care if a cannibal respects you or not after he killed you for dinner. You did not want to die and be eaten anyway. \nEven if the cannibal is starving and only killed you for his own survival. \nBut only for our own consciounce it's a good thing to respect and thank animals that we eat. That's better than<b>  nothing</b> of course. \nI am also a vegetarian and I think the world needs more vegetarians. Every society that has agriculture and food abundance does not need meat so for them the best way to respect animals is to leave them alone.\nOf course this does not count for people who live in a primitive way.",

You can show respect to the animal by treating it well and not killing it, or if you MUST kill it for your own survival to do it in the least painful way, but not by any kind of gratefulness or ritual after you killed it. \n\nMy point is not to be disrespectful to their culture, it's to call out the people that said above that it's respectable or honorable towards the animal if you kill the animal yourself and afterwards thank it for it's sacrifice. The animal does not care at all who kills it and wether they thank the animal or not. The animal wanted to live and can never know your intention or gratefulness. \n\nIt did not give a sacrifise because it did not sacrifise itself for you. \n\nRead the comments before mine and you'll understand what I mean. \n\nI am not angry with anybody but my believe is that we cannot respect animals if we kill and eat them when it's not neccessary for our health or survival.\nTradition does not change this. Look at the traditions with bull fighting in Spain. Just because it's tradition, does not make it moral.",

            "commentText": "Thanks Chelsea for providing these lovely people a platform to share their culture and messages. You rock. This is their native land after all and deserve respect, recognition and the preservation of their important culture tied closely with Mother Earth. Earth is crying out for help and indigenous people have a lot of wisdom of ways to preserve the land and ecosystems. We can all take part in this on a daily basis for the planet and for one enter living sustainably and reducing our consumption. Listen to the wise and the spiritual ! Their teachings are vital. And we must help preserve the land, water and air of fragile ecosystems and sacred land. Waste less, consume less, and become an advocate for these causes. I just wish animal preservation would be part of the goal. All animals are worthy of joy and no suffering",

But any way... We still here and they didnt take everything some way some how our ancestors kept it alive and it still exists !!! We may not like the way it is in this society but we adapt because we have no choice, still struggling to hold onto our identities but we do.",

Mega genocide of indigenous native Americans population in continents of America five hundred years ago was around fifteen millions, while European population in Europe was around twenty millions. Today, Native population at around fifteen million, while European population (in continents of America + Europe) at a staggering ONE BILLION! \rSo if Native American people had some kind of nuclear arsenals, enough to defend themselves from Colonizers, the Native people would still have their own beloved fatherlands, plus their population comparable to that of European population. As a matter of fact, China has made no secret that it would one day help liberate continents of America which it sees as rightfully belonging to Indigenous Native people.

As a German, I'm used to the fact that almost <b> nobody </b>names us the way we do it ourselves. In Slavic languages they just call us \"the speechless\" or \"the ones who just babble\". The English name for this tribe is \"Blackfoot\", so what? It's not lack of respect. It's just a name that was given generations ago. \nThe same goes for \"Indians\". Obviously it's a wrong and misleading term but I don't like the term \"Native Americans\" either because it's a made up term and it does not properly reflect the reality: Everybody born between Alaska and Tierra del Fuego is a \"native American\". I am also half Latin American and in Spanish we have a number of better terms for person belonging to the original peoples of the Americas. Maybe it's because we are more mixed up and because we consider their history to be our history and heritage, even those of us who are genetically pure Europeans.\nOtherwise: Good video.

This is why their was native tribes that fought with the Europeans against other native tribes. Do the Aztecs come in mind? The Europeans didn't poison the land either, they advanced everything.

I hope you realize that humans and chimpanzee share similar DNA. This is called human evolution. Maybe this is why a lot of Africans are less attractive due to facial features, skull structure and human behavior. Africans are close to our animal ancestors. And Neanderthals were human beings, I guess you could call them prehistoric humans. They migrated out of Africa and into Eurasia. While humans may have interbreed with neanderthals the pairing rarely produced offspring. Not everyone outside of Africa have Neanderthal DNA, and these people outside of Africa are Asians, middle easterns and European. So this also means Native Americans as well.

Don't pretend you lived and suffered the hardships of your ancestors as you sit on you<b> r fa</b>t ass enjoying the luxuries and amenities provided to you from the sweat and tears of those before us, which -prepare yourself - included * gasp * the white man . I doubt very much you have any more respect for the earth than I do. What rock do you live under?? In what dimension is first world living dirtier than other countries?!?

Today, Native population at around fifteen million, while European population (in continents of America + Europe) at a staggering ONE BILLION! \r\nImagine if Native American people had some sort of nuclear arsenals, enough to defend themselves from invaders and Colonizers, the Natives would still have their own beloved fatherlands, plus their population comparable to that of European population. Like I said, mega genocide of indigenous native American population in continents of America 500 yrs ago was around 15 millions, while European population in Europe was around 20 millions. Today, Native population at 15 million, while European population ( in continents of America + Europe) at ONE BILLION. As a matter of fact, China has made no secret that it would one day help liberate continents of America which it sees as rightfully belonging to Indigenous Native people.

We're all immigrants, we all derived from Africa, the first nations are not anymore \"American\" than any <b> race </b>that followed. And these tribes pushed out the inuits so they had to flee to inhospitable climates north of the Arctic circle, and does anyone reprimand the tribes for that? Does anyone subsidize or apologize to the Inuit people for that?? It's a huge can of worms that anyone actually involved in is long past.. The Western world created the blueprint of our standard of living today, would anyone voluntarily take their rights, privileges, comforts, modern medicine, amenities, and opportunities away for their original heritage?? NO. they would not. \nAnd Donald Trump's primary concern is to put America first, that means anyone born in the US, which would include native americans, as in, he is putting. them. first. Morons like you give Trump power, make him look better, give him traction. If this isn't what you were going for, which I'm guessing it's not, then I'd shut the fuck up if I were you.\ud83d\ude11",

Today I hope that the many <b> Indian </b>Nations have made strides to work together so they all may thrive.

Despite your hardened persona you portray on television, I have always felt you are a highly sensitive person.\nAlthough I am also Native American (Navajo, Apache, & Cherokee paternal side), I am city born & bred. The reservation peoples are different, as are the diverse tribal cultures. Despite having the full phenotype of my ancestors, sadly, I've never experienced more animosity than from certain rez residents.\nI am most appreciative of your showcasing of our indigenous First Nations, and I echo others sentiments of doing more of these.\n<b> Weird </b>how some of the dominant culture have idealized the Noble<b>  Indian</b>. It is a myth. \nI went through being hated and kicked out of places for being NA. I also used to live in a popular tourist town where I was treated like I was an exhibit, with visitors taking photographs of me without permission. I felt like a zoo animal.\nSuitors saw me as exotic.\nTrust me, I understand the guardedness.\nThank you.",

Natives are used to calling themselves by thier American government name so it's easier to refer to themselves that way. Blackfeet isn't wrong but Amskapi Pikuni is correct and preferred.

I had a pet calf on a farm I visited and would play with him on a leash. One day I saw his leash and collar in the yard but no calf. I walked in the big kitchen and there he was all opened up being processed. I haven't had a bite of meat since then. I swore I would die before eating another bite so my folks let me go vegetarian. I then went vegan at 16. I then became a serious athlete and everyone said I wouldn't be able to train on a vegan diet. After 20 years and hundreds of races won, two gold medals and numerous year end awards and two records, I proved them all wrong. Am retired now and still look 25. Don't have a gray hair. Don't eat meat. It's brutal. It's terrible sad. Now I rescue slaughter bound animals like rabbits, goats and sheep, a cow and horses. We have a farm and keep some for pets and rehome others. I think a lot of my good fortune in life came as a reward for not eating animals. I think a lot of merit is gained in not eating others bodies. One minute with an animal, no one could eat that animal unless they simply don't care and have no ability to feel empathy.",

The only reason why a lot of people are squeamish towards meat/killing animals is because we've gotten used to not hunting for own food. Like, especially in America, we don't see our meat before it's chopped up and seasoned. Go to other countries, and people are fine with killing a chicken or with going to the market and seeing butchered meat. \nLike, I respect being vegetarian, but stop trying to act like you're on a moral high ground just because you don't eat meat. You're no better than anyone else just because you don't eat meat, in fact, some vegan/vegetarian trends actually do more harm/are harming the environment.",

I eat no corpses or exploitive products from animals.

But seriously though, it IS a false righteousness that many vegetarians and vegans \u2018preach'.  \nTWO things: There is predation in nature.  If a person believes that we're all animals, and it's okay for lions to hunt, then it shouldn't bother that person when we eat meat.  \nSecondly - It's actually cruel to let herds breed uncontrollably.  They will eventually use up their resources and some will end up dying slow deaths due to starvation.  They also will end up eating crops that are meant for humans if left unchecked (deer).  What we all should be fighting for is proper treatment and responsible management of animals.  \nBonus - plants experience pain as well.  Many species send chemicals and have other defense mechanisms to avoid being eaten.  Fruits are made to be eaten (seed dispersal strategy), that's true, but not all plants or parts of plants are,.. and yet we do consume them.  Cruel vegans and vegetarians!! \ud83e\udd13",

Natives like to say they are their own people and are not Asian, but genetic testing isn't lying... although at the same time, they have been in the Americas for so long that they have diverged and have their own cultures/languages.",

I found that a person will consume about 14,600 gallons of water during their lifetime. And then I did some more 'extensive research' and found the average cost of water (tap water) to be $1.50 per 1,000 gallons. So 14,600/1,000x1.5=(Cost of Life's Supply of Water) It equals a whopping $21.9. :0 \n\nBottled water can easily exceed twice the cost of Gaso damn line. per volume of course.

Killing others for to sustain your own body is a crime against your own soul. Unless you are doing this ritually and fully exchanging your own liberation for the liberation of an animal that offers its life to you, then you are acting evil. From now on when you see dear you will see your sister and daughters. When you take aim at one you will see you are killing your sister or daughter. When you eat meat from now on you will see you are eating your mother's body to support your own. If you can eat your mother in good conscience because you trade her places then fine. If you cannot then you don't know what you are doing, stop harming others, stop killing others lest you return to this world to suffer that fate yourself. Every bacon burrito, every steak or hamburger or piece of chicken or turkey or fish or deer or anything you eat, from now on you will see your mother on that plate and always remember you are eating your mother and are responsible for her death.",

From now on you will see its your mother you are eating- because not seeing that means you'll have to experience your ignorance. And it won't be a blessed day for you then. Consider the harm hunting causes others. It's cruel. From a vegan almost half a century that looks 25 still, never had a health concern, and have two international competition gold medals as a vegan athlete. There is no reason you need to eat meat. I feel bad for you that one day will kill and eat you and state \"yum, ate deer meat last night\". Consider others lives. You seem like a positive person. Positivity based in ignorance of the suffering you cause others is dangerous. Please be kind to others- don't eat them.",

Just because it's neatly packaged does not mean humane. In general hunters shoot to kill they do not torture the animal. As long as you do your best to quickly kill the animal and eat what you hunt I have no issue with hunting. And having people tell what you should eat and that you're eating family members is wrong just because you disagree with people who eat meat.",
