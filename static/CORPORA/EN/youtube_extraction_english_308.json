Who allowed that pair of hipster (well the girl was not really a hipster) cretins to self congratulate themselves and slap each other on the back.  The problem with an opening like that is that you are introduced to a pair of complete narcissist wankers.  After which I could not really listen to either of them.  It was a struggle to listen to the other contributors after that.    \n\n\nI think the other two speakers were well informed and well-meaning, but their conclusions sounded to me like they wanted to address the issues of <b> nationalism </b>by \"fixing\" it.  Instead of merging it into whatever shape the EU comes forth.  They seemed to be the typical \"do-gooder\"  type.  \n\n\nMy take on the whole thing is that<b>  Nationalism</b> can still exist in this world and EU makeup.<b>   Nationalis</b>m has only in the last 10 years become a dirty word put forth by leftist types who don't know that what they are referring to is jingoism and n<b> ot nationali</b>sm. You will always have fringe elements in any democracy.  Always.  \r\n\n\nThe EU is a good thing.  It has helped staved off war and conflict (for the most part) in the EU since its formation.  Moreover the reduction of poverty and the introduction of social reforms across the EU has dramatically increased the standards of living across it.  \n\n\n\nThat being said I do agree it needs to change and change quickl<b> y.  Bre</b>xit is a direct result of the EU complacency and is a terrible thing that will happen.  The format of this change I can't really tell at the moment.  Maybe increase the power of the EU parliament and reduce the powers of the executives.  Alternatively, there could be more directly elected representatives, as the parliament for each country is synced with another representative parliament in the EU.  An upper house if you will.  Maybe something along those lines.  \n\n\nIn any event, while the EU is far from perfect, it is true to say that it has done a lot to curb the tribalism and jingoism of European countries.  It should also be remembered, but the alternative to the EU would be western and eastern European subjection to the Russian, American (and increasingly) Chinese interference and eventually domination.  Now, who would want to live in a world like that?",

I don't dictate the current trend of <b> nationalism </b>(fascism) in Europe, politicians and their voters do so your accusations about me being unable to get away from a narrow way of looking at<b>  nationalism</b> (a so-called \"narrow way\" that is based on facts and recent history) are completely baseless and frankly childish.\n\n\"They, as with UKIP, are both examples o<b> f nationalis</b>m that haven't resulted in war or conflict so your challenge is basically nonsense. \"\n\nThe Northern Irish conflict tells us that can happen at some point when nationalist parties start to gain too much influence, furthermore as I've stated before UKIP are the exception not the rule. Also, historically Scotland and England have been involved in wars before precisely throu<b> gh nationali</b>sm. The only reason they are no longer at war today is because european civilization has gotten civilized overtime and fighting for territories is no longer the historical and social mindset and trend nowadays.\n\nIf my statements are the sole trigger and basis for pushing people like you further to the right that just means you were heavily on the right or on the far-right all along and simply didn't have the courage to admit it. That argument is about as stupid as those who claim that by labeling peo<b> ple rac</b>ist they will actually start to be<b> come ra</b>cist. Pathetic kindergarten logic that holds no water.",

                    "commentText": "@Tarik Pasic You seem to have trouble understanding. By your own ridiculous logic, just because other people (that I also happen to disagree with) have a set of ideas that also falls under the rubric of '<b> nationalism'</b> that a defence of the broader concept (as well as my own civic<b>  nationalism</b>) equals a defence of them. What sheer and utter nonsense. \n\n\n\nYour whole argument is basically like saying 'all Muslims are terrorists, and if you don't agree you're normalizing terrorism.' Well there are degrees here, subtleties and nuances. To essentialize based upon the worst example is a rather absurd thing to do when you think of Muslims, so why does that same openness to shades of grey not apply here? The answer is that it does, you just refuse to see it. \n\n\n\nThe Northern Irish situation is somewhat separate, in that it again is tainted by religion. Had there not been a religious element, I'm of the belief that the conflict would have ended far sooner, but as I say that's a separate issue that one could spend months discussing so I won't bother here. \n\n\n\nThe funny thing in all this is that if you had a modicum of sense, you'd want people like me as your ally. Ethno-nationalists aren't suddenly going to become social justice warriors just because you don't like them, but they might become civic nationalists if you attempt to reason with them. All you're doing is lumping together the ethno types with the civic types and calling it a day. How you apparently don't see that you're creating an enemy out of an ally there is beyond me, but since you also appear to have not learned a single thing in this entire discussion, it isn't surprising.",

It's a movement that like communism has led to the deaths of millions of people throughout history as well as horrible unprecedented atrocities and war crimes, your unwillingness to acknowledge that by deflecting it to (civic??<b> ) nationalis</b>m is worrying to say the least. What you call civ<b> ic nationali</b>sm doesn't properly exist in the political sphere anywhere, every single mainstream nationalist party in Europe ressembles the ACTUAL definition<b>  of national</b>ism I described earlier, to deny that is to lie about reality.\n\nWith regards to Muslims, while you may have a moderate and sensible approach to that subject, I can assure you that most hardcore nationalists do not and that's part of the problem. Muslims have been targeted at large in recent past on european soil by nationalists (fascists), suffice to read up about what happened in Yugoslavia which was destroyed precisel<b> y by nationa</b>lism. My own family went through hell there because of nationalists.\n\nThe Northern Irish conflict barely has anything to do with religion especially nowadays. Not every conflict involving two different religious groups is automatically a religious conflict, that's a mistake far too many people make.\n\nThis goes back to my previous point, to say that you will somehow be pushed further to the right by people who de<b> spise nation</b>alism and call it out for what is only proves that you are already far on the right right now. It's about as logical (or illogical in this case) as claiming you will actually end up be<b> coming </b>racist if someone ca<b> lls you</b> racist which is a ridiculous statement I've heard many times before.

Similarly, if you're dealing with socialists, it's helpful to know your democratic socialist from your Stalinist. A similar distinction you seem pathologically unable to make. Which is a shame, because if you did you'd realize that most parties across Europe are a form of civic nationalist, in fact I'd argue it's so mainstream that most parties don't even bother to acknowledge it. \n\n\n\nMuslim point is irrelevant, you didn't understand what I said. \n\n\n\nAs someone that has lived with Northern Irish people, I beg to differ. \n\n\n\nAs to your latter point, it's not that you magically become a <b> racist </b>if called it enough times, it's that your voice is dismissed with the other racists as if you were the same, which in turn leads to widespread disengagement.

These aren't journalists, they are activists with no dissenting opinion allowed on stage to add any degree of balance. Go home! We have enough clueless voices like yours in this country and we are sick of it.\n\n\nNot one <b> nation </b>on earth has ever benefited or improved or advanced from Britain taking millions of desperate third world people yet it has led to a profound deterioration in our own sense of community. Imagine the conversations we could be having and the progress we could have made were we not ghettoized by a zoo of conflicting cultures that have<b>  nothing</b> to do with our way of life. Where are the nuanced native communities of my childhood for my descendants to grow up in? \n\n\nDiversity is our strength we are told as enclaves of hostile third world nationals engage in intra-communal violence, stabbings, acid attacks and postcode drug gangs on our streets and outside schools. Tens of thousands of native children have been trafficked and raped by familial gangs of foreign nationals whilst middle class privileged people paid from the public purse to protect them looked away. You would have to be a complete madman to visit this kind of sectarianism an<b> d alie</b>n theology on your city streets.",

The underlying problem sitting under this motion of impotence is being demonstrated on this stage your viewing. Can we really say this issue of <b> Nationalism </b>can be adequately represented or observed in a balanced manner with this panel? Listen Venus, you have intellectualized the globe from an aloof position right into the slop you are pawning off as democracy .<b>  Nobody</b> is going to wait around for mommy to admit she was wrong. Despite her crucial role and irreplaceable presence and function she no longer deems as adequate , accountability isnt her biggest strength. People have woken up to the general patterns of New York Time's journalism. Peanut Butter idealism and intellectual superiority complexes  in blanket statements spread over the course bread of extreme circumstance felt by those not being represented or protected. We have the same disgusting bafoonery in Canada with the slime of the CBC. Globalism is the disintegration of Nations ,plain and simple. The UN has overstepped its position as one issuing demands. Hate him if you will as a person (irrelevant though Libertardes do not get that) BUT if it was not for the Trump Administration's assertiveness in refusing to comply with this Globalism manovre, other forms of Leadership throughout the European Union may not have said things like NOOOO concerning mass immigration. Suddenly people realise they have a right to stand up and make a choice. AND THEY STILL DO . White guilt is generated from a very weak and frail place indeed. Sorry Muffin, but it seems Daddy is coming home and if you have weaved a tangled web of filth painted over in the guise of virtue while unwittingly putting your country in danger HE MIGHT JUST BURN THE G-D DAMNED HOUSE DOWN. THE THREAT OF COMMUNISM IS WHAT BROUGHT ABOUT 33 GERMANY AND HITLER'S MADNESS WAS THE FRIGHTENING REACTION. PEOPLE FORGET THAT AND PAINT A DIFFERENT PICTURE IN THEIR HYPOCHONDRIA . This is just another symptom of mass feminizing around the world . Lets not talk about how that got off the ground and became the emotional raving meltdown it did. Dont even think about using the F word. Unless you want some extreme entertainment in a G neighborhood. The melt downs are hilarious. After all, we all have learned that politeness has been proven to be waaaayyy more important than the truth. Yah right. I can already hear the hissing lisps and shrieking  androgyny fist shaking. Purple and green haired disgusting emotional basket cases are falsely accusing men o<b> f sexua</b>l misconduct and the like because we have created a social system where they know the mere accusation can destroy a guy WHO CANT STAND YOU.  Little children do not even KNOW WH<b> AT S</b>EX they are going to be . You ushered in this madness and the dialogue is almost at an end. And just as there is no turning back concerning the boundaries you spit on in your bitchy egomania, there is no escaping the aftermath and the rage that is going to level the playing field. There is a higher authority attached to truth that the masses have turned away from and there will be hell to pay. RIGHT HERE ON EARTH. And spare us all your shot gun analyses concerning who you feel is ultra RT wing<b>  or rac</b>ist etc. as people are not listening to these retarded exaggerations anymore. UP MARS, DOWN VENUS.",

                    "commentText": "'If your culture and heritage and history play no role in determining who you are, then you truly have roots in shallow ground and can be made to believe anything by anyone. By subverting these characteristics of national identity from a peoples' collective memory, the <b> black </b>magicians of the Marxist left and their sycophantic liberal mainstream media acolytes have managed to bully and cajole ordinary people into believing extraordinary things.' \r\n\r\n'When a government arbitrarily abandons its people and inflicts, without their consent, the wicked ideologies of mass immigration, multiculturalism, miscegenation and Islamification, then its mandate to call itself a DEMOCRACY has gone. When it co-opts sycophantic acolytes in the media to promote and propagate its agenda, it's become AUTHORITARIAN. When it hides the atrocious realities of its failed policies from the people, it's now become TOTALITARIAN and when it enshrines hate law against the indigenous population to stifle objection and shut down free speech in the public space, it's now crossed over the invisible Rubicon and become FASCIST.'\r\n\r\n'Clothed in the robes of respectability the police, media, technocrats and politicians are puppets to the<b>  black</b> magicians of Globalism who salivate at cultural destruction and the deracination of native European peoples' from their homeland. They have achieved this already with our high-streets and now it is our turn.'\r\n\r\n'The Globalist Aristocracy have socially engineered a dystopian nightmare by frightening nebbish European men into sacrificing their agency and moral responsibility to protect their homeland, womenfolk and children in the face of a savage desert death mythology, miscegenation and multiculturalism and all it took was WORDS!'\r\n\n\nA budget is a moral document. So when our traitorous politicians budget and sign cheques using OUR money to accommodate Syrian and Somali children rather than fund humane treatment for native children forced to live in hostels, you know they have no moral compass. When they budget 13,000,000,000 pounds every year of OUR money to foreigners yet allow pensioners to choose between food and keeping warm in the winter months (last year winter deaths in England hit a 42-year high), you know they are no longer fit to represent us. When they budget for 100's o<b> f terroris</b>t to integrate back to our society using OUR money, rather than helping the homeless ex-servicemen, you know they have become enemies of the people they are paid, with OUR money to serve and protect.\r\n\r\n'What kind of country or culture or politics facilitates then justifies the replacement of their own people, the miscegenation of their womenfolk and the rape of their children by foreign nationals? Mine.'\r\n\r\nWe are no longer men! We are emasculated eunuchs typing on keyboards whilst unfettered female hypergamy promotes mating with foreign men supplied by a government with its hand in our pocket. \r\n\r\nOur vitiate men-children go to football matches days after children are blasted on to arena walls. They go <b> on <b> g</b</b>>ay parades and fun runs as native children up and down the country are preyed on and trafficked by Mosque and familial mass rape gangs They are facilitated by people paid from the public purse to protect them. The police, social workers and Labour councils pretend it's not happening and the press hide it.\r\n\n\nWomen don't see danger, they are genetically predisposed to mate with dominant males and live with<b> in a patria</b>rchy. When Angela Merkle and Theresa May invited fighting and bre<b> edin</b>g age foreign men into Europe, they were only thinking of their own barren wombs and responding emotionally. \r\n\n\nWe push our womenfolk into the workplace instead of supporting them as mothers and our population has become unsustainable. We cheapen the standing of women as homemakers and nurturers by deconstr<b> ucting </b>gender roles and ignoring our need to reproduce and the responsibility they have to the future of our people. Maybe some women achieve great satisfaction with careers but the vast majority live unfulfilled unhappy lives behind desks or in factories whilst someone else takes care of their kids, if they can be bothered to have any. At the same time, Muslim females 75% of whom, do not work, breed indiscriminately and are supported by the \u2018tax cattle' our childless working drone females have become. We are sold this concept as 'freedom' but all we are doing is manag<b> ing the tra</b>nsition from a post Christian Society to a Muslim State.  \r\n\n\nWe have killed ourselves with kindness by allowing universal suffrage, a welfare state and the extirpatio<b> n of the pa</b>triarchy.   \r\n\n\nBecause of the political left's insistence on identity politics, we need to rapidly coalesce around our group identity as Northern Europeans. Forget values, those days are gone. This is a time of<b>  profound t</b>ransition from the ethno-state of my youth to a valueless society of intersectional politics that's leading to our replacement. \r\n\n\nSupra-national agencies, NGO's and governments are colluding with big business, (the very definition of Fascism/Communism) and frame their faces to all occasions. They encourage population replacement and a low wage economy that empowers big government and freezes native men out of owning a house in their own country because once you don't have a stake in society, why would you care what direction it takes. \r\n\n\nMiscegenation through horrendous advertising campaigns showing beautiful Northern European <b> women wi</b>th African men and a dopey native white guy somewhere in the background further exacerbating the marginalization process. They have eclipsed the need for men to be breadwinners or play meaningful, responsible roles in raising children so they have responded by killing themselves in unprecedented numbers.\r\n\n\n The State is now daddy by picking the pockets of men and providing education, healthcare, welfare, and housing however dysfunctionally women choose to mate by having kids from many partners. There used to be social consequences and stigma <b> attached to </b>promiscuous women and now there is none and the nuclear family has been utterly destroyed by \u2018progressive' \u2018Social Marxist' dogma and big government. I wonder what the suffragettes of 120 years ago would say if they could see the pink haire<b> d, tat</b>tooed, obese sluts, the barren minimum wage slaves or the hypergamy Princesses they helped create. Recent studies of dating sites show 80% of women are only interested in the top 20% of men. This is the hidden effect of big government. How do you build a society from that? You don't, you import one. \r\n\n\nAdd to that the hedonistic, dehumanizing, hyper-sexualized entertainment, advertising and pornography industries that mass produces vapid vulgar content for mass consumption to numbed sensibilities. Narcissistic amoral, vacuous reality TV, bereft of moral filters that normalizes cheating and betrayal. Broken families, f<b> eminize</b>d men, tomboy females, trans-sexuals and insipid youth all go to highlight the depraved late stages of a lost society, legitimized by an indifferent but authoritarian State. \r\n\n\nDrugs that riddle society are softened by calling them recreational and cater to the soulless, androgynous, automatons required to tolerate existence in this increasingly Huxleyesque dystopian, totalitarian nightmare.\r\n\n\nNihilistic, post-modern concrete and steel, globalist architecture that dehumanize and anesthetize now stand where beautiful monuments to our rich civilization use to grace the public space. Subversive or scared university professors are deconstructing history and removing statues of eminent native visionaries from walls and the syllabus. Historical revisionism infects the minds of the next generation who are taught to hate and not venerate our history and achievements. These foot-soldiers for Mom<b> entum,</b> Antifa, Black Lives Matter, Tell Mama and Hope Not Hate are brainwashed into celebrating their own destruction.\r\n\n\nObjective values that once underpinned our great society are replaced with subjective opinions and feelings by left-wing activists who celebrate every<b> thing bu</b>t value nothing. They raise themselves by lowering others and their highest achievements have been politi<b> cal cor</b>rectness, gender fluidity, intersectionality, identity politics, 3rd wave feminism, Social justice warriors, safe spaces, historical revisionism, hate speech law, diversity and the banishment of pronouns. \r\n\n\nThe counter-culture lies in ruins around the feet of epicene youth whose responsibility has always been to fight conformity but now rejoice at inclusion and respect for all, at all times, on all issues, even though their own opportunities to live as their forefathers did for centuries is forbidden and increasingly unknown to them. These are the brave warriors of tomorrow who cannot look forward because they were never allowed to look back. They now stand guilty in defense of their own destruction and our people, placated with bread and circuses and cowered by words, will soon cry salt tears in bewilderment as their civilization and all they have known is swept away forever.",

Like her children, I am also the product of two people from two different European countries. I do not feel like a 'European' because that means <b> nothing </b>to me. Its like saying, I am a 'human being'. It goes without saying. I am a Dane. I was born in Denmark and I live in Denmark. You cannot impose an identity onto people, especially not for the selfish reasons this German<b>  woman</b> subscribes to. Germany must deal with its past by itself and not impose it onto the rest of us. Her daughter's innocent ignorance is not a moral lesson to be taught as some kind of wisdom. To pretend otherwise is a form of self-deception. The UK leaving the EU is an act of national self-determination and ha<b> s nothin</b>g to do with the self-perception of individuals. Like her daughter, I also grew up in the UK, and I spent my entire childhood there. This did not give me any right to lecture British people on their identity of their desire for self-determination. In many ways I am a person of two cultures and two nations (just like so many others on this planet) and I know from long experience that this can lead to contradictions and conflicts in one's own identity. These can be many and varied and can lead to intense confusion. At the same time however, being of two different cultures can also give a richer understanding of how nations and cultures work and how nations and peoples can not simply be forced together to form a compatable union. True harmony has to be homogenous and equally beneficial to both parties. The EU is neither. On the contrary, the EU is a top-down, political imposition that takes no account of cultural differences and seeks to impose undemocratic and unacountable socio-economic policies as the basis for union. I share no cultural identity with Germans and I find this claim to a 'European identity' to be both an abanondment of Germany's cultural responsibilities and an unwanted invasion on my own national cultural identity. \nGermany and the German people own their past. They cannot run away from who they were, because who they were is still who they are. Individual Germans may seek refuge outside of their shameful past, but they cannot escape the fact that they are the product of German culture and they must not impose their desired identity onto the rest of us and expect us to carry their burden of shame. I will not identity as a European just so you can feel better about yourself and you do not get to run away from who are by pretending tha we are one and the same! \nGerman culture <b> is nothi</b>ng like British culture, just as British culture<b>  is noth</b>ing like Danish culture, no matter how many similarities you cherry pick to claim otherwise.",

                    "commentText": "'If your culture and heritage and history play no role in determining who you are, then you truly have roots in shallow ground and can be made to believe anything by anyone. By subverting these characteristics of national identity from a peoples' collective memory, the <b> black </b>magicians of the Marxist left and their sycophantic liberal mainstream media acolytes have managed to bully and cajole ordinary people into believing extraordinary things.' \r\n\r\n'When a government arbitrarily abandons its people and inflicts, without their consent, the wicked ideologies of mass immigration, multiculturalism, miscegenation and Islamification, then its mandate to call itself a DEMOCRACY has gone. When it co-opts sycophantic acolytes in the media to promote and propagate its agenda, it's become AUTHORITARIAN. When it hides the atrocious realities of its failed policies from the people, it's now become TOTALITARIAN and when it enshrines hate law against the indigenous population to stifle objection and shut down free speech in the public space, it's now crossed over the invisible Rubicon and become FASCIST.'\r\n\r\n'Clothed in the robes of respectability the police, media, technocrats and politicians are puppets to the<b>  black</b> magicians of Globalism who salivate at cultural destruction and the deracination of native European peoples' from their homeland. They have achieved this already with our high-streets and now it is our turn.'\r\n\r\n'The Globalist Aristocracy have socially engineered a dystopian nightmare by frightening nebbish European men into sacrificing their agency and moral responsibility to protect their homeland, womenfolk and children in the face of a savage desert death mythology, miscegenation and multiculturalism and all it took was WORDS!'\r\n\n\nA budget is a moral document. So when our traitorous politicians budget and sign cheques using OUR money to accommodate Syrian and Somali children rather than fund humane treatment for native children forced to live in hostels, you know they have no moral compass. When they budget 13,000,000,000 pounds every year of OUR money to foreigners yet allow pensioners to choose between food and keeping warm in the winter months (last year winter deaths in England hit a 42-year high), you know they are no longer fit to represent us. When they budget for 100's o<b> f terroris</b>t to integrate back to our society using OUR money, rather than helping the homeless ex-servicemen, you know they have become enemies of the people they are paid, with OUR money to serve and protect.\r\n\r\n'What kind of country or culture or politics facilitates then justifies the replacement of their own people, the miscegenation of their womenfolk and the rape of their children by foreign nationals? Mine.'\r\n\r\nWe are no longer men! We are emasculated eunuchs typing on keyboards whilst unfettered female hypergamy promotes mating with foreign men supplied by a government with its hand in our pocket. \r\n\r\nOur vitiate men-children go to football matches days after children are blasted on to arena walls. They go <b> on <b> g</b</b>>ay parades and fun runs as native children up and down the country are preyed on and trafficked by Mosque and familial mass rape gangs They are facilitated by people paid from the public purse to protect them. The police, social workers and Labour councils pretend it's not happening and the press hide it.\r\n\n\nWomen don't see danger, they are genetically predisposed to mate with dominant males and live with<b> in a patria</b>rchy. When Angela Merkle and Theresa May invited fighting and bre<b> edin</b>g age foreign men into Europe, they were only thinking of their own barren wombs and responding emotionally. \r\n\n\nWe push our womenfolk into the workplace instead of supporting them as mothers and our population has become unsustainable. We cheapen the standing of women as homemakers and nurturers by deconstr<b> ucting </b>gender roles and ignoring our need to reproduce and the responsibility they have to the future of our people. Maybe some women achieve great satisfaction with careers but the vast majority live unfulfilled unhappy lives behind desks or in factories whilst someone else takes care of their kids, if they can be bothered to have any. At the same time, Muslim females 75% of whom, do not work, breed indiscriminately and are supported by the \u2018tax cattle' our childless working drone females have become. We are sold this concept as 'freedom' but all we are doing is manag<b> ing the tra</b>nsition from a post Christian Society to a Muslim State.  \r\n\n\nWe have killed ourselves with kindness by allowing universal suffrage, a welfare state and the extirpatio<b> n of the pa</b>triarchy.   \r\n\n\nBecause of the political left's insistence on identity politics, we need to rapidly coalesce around our group identity as Northern Europeans. Forget values, those days are gone. This is a time of<b>  profound t</b>ransition from the ethno-state of my youth to a valueless society of intersectional politics that's leading to our replacement. \r\n\n\nSupra-national agencies, NGO's and governments are colluding with big business, (the very definition of Fascism/Communism) and frame their faces to all occasions. They encourage population replacement and a low wage economy that empowers big government and freezes native men out of owning a house in their own country because once you don't have a stake in society, why would you care what direction it takes. \r\n\n\nMiscegenation through horrendous advertising campaigns showing beautiful Northern European <b> women wi</b>th African men and a dopey native white man somewhere in the background further exacerbating the marginalization process. They have eclipsed the need for men to be breadwinners or play meaningful, responsible roles in raising children so they have responded by killing themselves in unprecedented numbers.\r\n\n\n The State is now daddy by picking the pockets of men and providing education, healthcare, welfare, and housing however dysfunctionally women choose to mate by having kids from many partners. There used to be social consequences and stigma <b> attached to </b>promiscuous women and now there is none and the nuclear family has been utterly destroyed by \u2018progressive' \u2018Social Marxist' dogma and big government. I wonder what the suffragettes of 120 years ago would say if they could see the pink haire<b> d, tat</b>tooed, obese sluts, the barren minimum wage slaves or the hypergamy Princesses they helped create. Recent studies of dating sites show 80% of women are only interested in the top 20% of men. This is the hidden effect of big government. How do you build a society from that? You don't, you import one. \r\n\n\nAdd to that the hedonistic, dehumanizing, hyper-sexualized entertainment, advertising and pornography industries that mass produces vapid vulgar content for mass consumption to numbed sensibilities. Narcissistic amoral, vacuous reality TV, bereft of moral filters that normalizes cheating and betrayal. Broken families, f<b> eminize</b>d men, tomboy females, trans-sexuals and insipid youth all go to highlight the depraved late stages of a lost society, legitimized by an indifferent but authoritarian State. \r\n\n\nDrugs that riddle society are softened by calling them recreational and cater to the soulless, androgynous, automatons required to tolerate existence in this increasingly Huxleyesque dystopian, totalitarian nightmare.\r\n\n\nNihilistic, post-modern concrete and steel, globalist architecture that dehumanize and anesthetize now stand where beautiful monuments to our rich civilization use to grace the public space. Subversive or scared university professors are deconstructing history and removing statues of eminent native visionaries from walls and the syllabus. Historical revisionism infects the minds of the next generation who are taught to hate and not venerate our history and achievements. These foot-soldiers for Mom<b> entum,</b> Antifa, Black Lives Matter, Tell Mama and Hope Not Hate are brainwashed into celebrating their own destruction.\r\n\n\nObjective values that once underpinned our great society are replaced with subjective opinions and feelings by left-wing activists who celebrate every<b> thing bu</b>t value nothing. They raise themselves by lowering others and their highest achievements have been politi<b> cal cor</b>rectness, gender fluidity, intersectionality, identity politics, 3rd wave feminism, Social justice warriors, safe spaces, historical revisionism, hate speech law, diversity and the banishment of pronouns. \r\n\n\nThe counter-culture lies in ruins around the feet of epicene youth whose responsibility has always been to fight conformity but now rejoice at inclusion and respect for all, at all times, on all issues, even though their own opportunities to live as their forefathers did for centuries is forbidden and increasingly unknown to them. These are the brave warriors of tomorrow who cannot look forward because they were never allowed to look back. They now stand guilty in defense of their own destruction and our people, placated with bread and circuses and cowered by words, will soon cry salt tears in bewilderment as their civilization and all they have known is swept away forever.",

The \"treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe\" and its undemocratic ratification via the treaty of lisbon is one of the tipping points, where the<b>  common</b> market was more important than democracy and the instituins of theEU where used to undermine democracy. Theoretically a unified europe and democracy are not mutually exclusive. Democracy has just become bothersome for the elites in their goal to enrich themselves. But contrary to the nationalist movement I believe a unified europe is the only option for our continent!",

This, of course, would not fly in the context of the secular liberalism which accompanied much of the new nationalist era.\n\nSo yeah, while that all is a bit simplified (it being Youtube) it is worth considering the historical context of these identities to which you may cling so tightly.",
