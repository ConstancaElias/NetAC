        "postText": "Hannah-Marie Clayton, 10, was incensed at the slogan on her favourite cereal, which said: \u201cLoved by kids, approved by mums.\u201d', 'She wrote to the company pointing out that her father James, 47, a landscape gardener, is often on breakfast duty because her mother Anne-Marie, 48, is an airline cabin crew leader.', 'Kellogg\u2019s has now promised to alter the wording on the boxes to read: \u201cApproved by parents\u201d. It will be on supermarket shelves in November.', 'Hannah-Marie\u2019s protest echoes that of Meghan Markle who, at 11, made Procter & Gamble change a \u201csexist\u201d washing-up liquid TV advert showing a sink of dirty dishes as a voiceover said: \u201cWomen are fighting greasy pots and pans with Ivory Soap.\u201d', 'After receiving a letter from her, the company changed the wording.', 'Hannah-Marie, of Bournemouth, who is a pupil at St Walburga\u2019s School, said: \u201cMy mum was away so I was just with my dad when I saw it on the cereal box.', '\u201cIt made me think that dads should be included as well because they are important too. Also, some people don\u2019t have a mum and they might find it upsetting.\u201d', 'Her letter said: \u201cI feel that quote is sexist, men are also able to make breakfast. \u201cMy dad does it a lot for me because my mum works away a lot and is not always there for breakfast. I would recommend instead of putting \u2018mums\u2019, put parents or carers. It would just mean a small change. In this world today we shouldn\u2019t just rely on women.\u201d', 'She was amazed when a letter from Kellogg\u2019s arrived, saying: \u201cI wanted to let you know that we\u2019ve recently renewed our research and our new pack design will refer to approval from both mums and dads. Apologies for any offence caused and thank you for your feedback, which has played a part in our decision to change.\u201d', 'Mrs Clayton said: \u201cJames and I are both very proud of Hannah-Marie. You can make a difference, no matter how big or small, if you voice an opinion \u2013 even to a large corporation.\u201d', 'A Kellogg\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cWe agree with HannahMarie: Dads love to have Coco Pops too. We\u2019ll start making these in a couple of weeks when the changes to our cereal pack printers have been made.\u201d",
