Whites have done good and bad, but ultimately it doesn't matter,because the individual matters the most. I didn't do any of that shit you listed, so I feel no shame. However, I also didn't write Romeo and Juliet, go to the moon, think up the theory of relativity, etc, so I feel no pride. Why the hell would either of those things be attached to my skin tone, anyway? people are so annoying. They think if they have the same color they're the same. That's why people harass whites for crimes of their ancestors. Focus on the present. The past bleeds into the present, but you cannot punish the innocent for the crimes of the another. I am going to write a book, one day, and just yell at y'all about how you guys love tribalism and how it perpetuates <b> xenophobia </b>and bigotry. \n\nEvery<b>  race</b> has brutality and suffering in it and I'm sick to death of people trying to shame me just because people who looked like me were pieces of shit. I'm over it. I don't desire pride nor shame. It's a damn skin color. Its like being proud of all blondes. Meh. Yes, I went on a sleep deprived rant, that's what's up when I get my buttons pushed.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk.",

And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,\n\n18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the <b> blind,</b> to set at liberty them that are bruised,\n\n19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.\n\n20 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.\n\n21 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.\n\n22 And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?\n\n23 And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.\n\n24 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.\n\n25 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;\n\n26 But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a<b>  woman</b> that was a widow.\n\n27 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.\n\n28 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,\n\n29 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.\n\n30 But he passing through the midst of them went his way,\n\n31 And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.\n\nLuke 4:16-31\n\n\nBTW I have white skin and declare that Jesus is Lord of lords and King of kings.\n\n\nJesus said:\n\n43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.\n\n44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;\n\n45 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\n\n46 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?\n\n47 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?\n\n48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\n\nMatthew 5:43-48\n\n\nAm I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?",

Rejection of Islam is not irrational as it has not been a positive force over the last four hundred years, it has only caused misery and hate in recent history. \n\nAs an atheist I reject all religion, a community being changed by an incoming negative IDEA for their owns ends can only lead too problems.",

Blond hair is a recessive gene, you'd have to have two parents who carry the gene to end up with it and even then it is only a 25% chance. If you are 50% <b> black </b>that means one of your parents would have to be 100%<b>  black</b>, but blond hair isn't native to Africa and therefore not found in blacks.\nAt most you might be able to be 25<b> % blac</b>k and have blond hair. And that is not even taking into consideration any of the other incredibly unlikely gene combinations you'd have to have too.\n\nBut yea... Absolutely impossible for you to be 5<b> 0% bla</b>ck and have blond hair. You'd have to be 25% or less, probably much less given the number of other characteristics you've provided.

J ewish ppl are not white persons of european descent, they are turko-mongolian mixed<b>  race</b>, over a period of time some j ewish ppl intermarried with european whites and after a few generations feature changes, but still dna identifies them. Most non-whites think (when they see a j ewish person) that they are a european white person. But j ewish persons are not Europeans and never were. If a j ewish person lives in say France, he might say 'I am European' but geography does not turn him into a native Frenchman, he is simply a j ewish person residing in France. Any european looking at this man on stage can quickly identify him as j ewish by physical features alone. And as we all know, all msm, hollywood, airwaves, printing houses, are completely 100% j ewish owned.",

Ancestry has 9 basic regions with 500 sub regions. European is one of those 9 regions. French German are sub regions. The test probably said 84% European and went on to elaborate what regions of Europe from there. He could have dozens of European regions in his DNA. These tests can get even more specific telling you where in France you're from. Or in his case where in africa he's from. It's really cool you should try it.",

And yes, it's brain damage that some humans have brains that don't have the ability to empathize with the other humans. Sociopaths, psychopaths, and malignant narcissists(like Trump) have no capacity to even learn to care and so they damage the rest of us who aren't educated enough to recognize danger in others to stop them from gaining power over us.",

Humans are all so genetically similar and so intermixed that they have no subspecies, and no races. What we CALL <b> \u2018race</b>' is actually just a rough set of traits related to locality - and even then, very loosely. We're not even as different as different breeds of dogs (sometimes the term<b>  \u2018rac</b>e' is applied to breeds - but even then, humans have no breeds, either).\n\nWe're more like dogs of the same breed with different coat colors, like a blue merle versus gold border collie. Any difference among animals similar to what humans call \u2018races' among themselves would be too insignificant to even mention in taxonomy. Yes there is significant genetic diversity but it hasn't reached a threshold for scientific classification. That is, there hasn't been any actual major 'isolation' event that has 'separated' the human chain or descendant for long enough to develop radically different 'sub-species'. It's below what taxonomists would call \"subspecies\" as for now. \n\nThe day the genetic diversity is great enough to be of taxonomic significance is the day it moves from \"social construct\" to scientific classification.\n\n [LINK] \n\n [LINK] \n\n^(This helps explain why it isn't accurate when applied to humans\u2014because, as the above articles point, out there is no genetic distinction, only trends within populations).",

If you believe that this white hate is only temporary, you are quite gullible. Propaganda can be very, very powerful.

I get that not everyone is like that, but time and time again we are proven to be wrong. The amount of terrorism has sky rocketed in this country. We need a break and we need to figure something out. Also trump and Hillary need to be behind bars. Both are guilty of illegal actions. While we are at it, everyone in our government needs to be thrown out and new people need to be thrown in or else this cycle will continue. Our whole government system is filled with fleas. Either way, thinking that all of our problems will just disappear is literally the definition of unrealistic. It's either we fight against it, or we go with the flow and sooner or later get treated like shit every day of our insignificant lives. I personally would rather just try my hardest to support my own people and lift them up while everyone else is pushing them down. Especially when it comes to white men.

I'm white and I live in Puerto Rico, whites are the minority here. It's just the outrage culture that has you thinking that way.

So you're basically saying you won't be able to love your children just because they slightly deviate from your appearance? You seem like the <b> woman </b>who'd dump their baby if he doesnt meet your expectations in looks. Do you know how superficial and heartless that you are? \n\n\"If YOU think that every<b>  race</b> is beautiful in their own way, why would you want to mix all of us up? Where's the diversity in that?\"\n\nHuh, what kind of idiotic logic is that? If every group of people is beautiful in their own way, then what's stopping you from being in relationship with them? So you are accepting of differences in people but not accepting enough to be in relationship with them? See, this is where your logic falls flat. If you're truly accepting of differences in people, you'd be capable of accepting of those differences in loving them too. So logically it follows that you believe your group of people are superior in terms of looks/culture, otherwise you'd be capable of seeing everyone as equals, but you don't. Do you know who believed the same? Hitler. That's right, people were discriminated based on eye, hair, skin color, culture and many other superficial traits which was one of the main reasons for the Holocaust. It's so obvious to see you're using the \"preserving culture/diversity\" argument to mask \nyour true beliefs.\n\nSecond, you don't have the faintest idea if you think culture/heritage is lost being in intercultural/interracial relationships. I'm from a family who has seen plenty of intercultural marriages and I can guarantee there's mutual respect and love for each other's culture. People who are open minded and truly love each other won't let any sort of differences get in their way to be with them. Anyone who uses \"preserving culture\" argument against those marriage tells me they're either lazy to put in the work/judgemental/xenophobic/ethnocentric deep down. There's only conflict in cultures only if you can't overlook/negotiate them. I even know hardcore atheists and theists doing well in relationships.\n\nEven assuming your culture gradually dies away and a new culture takes its place in the future generations, why should it even bother you? You aren't around to see this new culture anyway. This is how it has always been in the past, cultures evolve and new cultures are birthed. It's called \"cultural heterogenization\". Read your own European history on how your culture came into existence. \n\nSo give me one logical reason why someone should give two shits about their heritage. How and why should it matter to you? How Is it in anyway benefitting you now by fearing for something that may or may not happen in future generations? \n\n\"Have we learned anything from history?\"\n\nLet me tell you what we have learned from history, if anything, Almost every war that started in the past are because of either nationalistic or religious reasons and even to this day we have conflicts between different nationalities and religious groups. This irrational nationalistic sentiment creates an \"Us vs them\" attitude which serves no purpose other than divide people. If people truly learned to let go of their ego and learned to love everyone, we wouldn't be hatred in the first place.\n<b> \n\"Nationalis</b>m is an infantile disease. It's the measles of mankind\"\n\n- Albert Einstein",

You folks seem to care too much about <b> \"race</b>\" that you y'all form extremist nationalist groups living in perpetual false victimhood and use that narrative to create more division among people. What happened in the past, should stay there. You want to end hate towards whites? Stop discriminating and profiling people. Treat and love everyone as equals.

I'll tell you what's natural, We all lived together before we all forced ourselves our way out of Africa. The side effect, however, was that we became so coddled and comfortable around people in our personal territory that anyone who shows up different than us would be met with aggression and signs of displeasure. As a progressive society, it's about time we become self aware of our own prejudice and force ourselves to live together so that we eventually override them.\n\nThere's <b> nothing </b>natural in Racism/prejudice and many studies have validated this. We feel comfortable because that's the environment we grew up in.\n\n\"Following a series of studies, researchers have discovered that six- to nine-month-old infants demonstrated racial bias in favor of members of their own<b>  race</b> and bias against those of other races.\n\nThe findings are said to be a result of the overwhelming exposure infants have to their ow<b> n rac</b>e, and experts have warned it is wise to introduce children to people from a variety of races before the issues deepen.\"\n\n [LINK] \n\n [LINK] \n\nSee?

I don't know where you learned biology, but there's no such thing as \"breeds\" in humans.\n\nHumans are all so genetically similar and so intermixed that they have no subspecies, no breeds and no races. What we CALL \u2018<b> race'</b> is actually just a rough set of traits related to locality - and even then, very loosely. We're not even as different as different breeds of dogs (sometimes the term <b> \u2018race</b>' is applied to breeds - but even then, humans have no breeds, either).\n\nWe're more like dogs of the same breed with different coat colors, like a blue merle versus gold border collie. Any difference among animals similar to what humans call \u2018races' among themselves would be too insignificant to even mention in taxonomy. Yes there is significant genetic diversity but it hasn't reached a threshold for scientific classification. That is, there hasn't been any actual major 'isolation' event that has 'separated' the human chain or descendant for long enough to develop radically different 'sub-species'. It's below what taxonomists would call \"subspecies\" as for now. \n\n\"I have never NOT met an individual who is unbiased and somewhat kind of a saint. We just have to realize that we are no different from animals in some ways\"\n\nThen you need to get outside from living in your little square box and meet more people.  Not everyone is a primitive animal who are slaves to their base instincts. I'm one of them. I don't pledge allegiance to a particular group<b> /\"rac</b>e\"/religion etc despite what my background is. I'm not prejudiced against whites, blacks, Asians etc in any shape or form, why? because people like us have the ability to think.\n\nSo speak for yourself cuz animals don't have the ability to think for themselves and study shows that people who are prejudiced/conservatives/Alt right are all associated with low IQ.

Full disclosure: I had an opposite experience growing up unlike yours. I grew up being prejudiced just like you are now but I became aware of my own bias and overcomed it once I got into Academia. Difference between you and me is that I believe in the collective good of everyone on this earth through multiculturalism which is demonstrated to be true through experiments i cited above and not favouritism towards a particular group like you believe.\n\nSo you're citing violence and terrorism as your evidence that multiculturalism hasn't worked? \n\nMulticulturalism hasn't reached its supposed endgame to conclude that it has destroyed societies, so it's a moot point. Sure there might be hiccups initially but that's inevitable and part of the process. The ultimate motivation of multiculturalism is to integrate people from other cultures into every other culture and embrace diversity.\n\nWhat we all are experiencing right now is a \"cultural disequilibrium\", a state of unrest as a consequence of coming into contact with different cultures. It's inevitable, part and parcel of the tribalistic nature of humans to react to anything different from us but it's temporary. \n\nThrough \"exposure effect\" , people will gradually be tolerant towards everyone.  Choosing segregation is going in the opposite direction and will only make it worse. I don't expect you to understand this because you're emotionally invested and you're judgement is compromised. But I hope you get it someday.",

Most non-whites think (when they see a j ewish person) that they are a european white person. But j ewish persons are not Europeans and never were. If a j ewish person lives in say France, he might say 'I am European' but geography does not turn him into a native Frenchman, he is simply a j ewish person residing in France. Any european looking at this man on stage can quickly identify him as j ewish by physical features alone.

Because most <b> black </b>people make no distinction between Jews and whites, it is easy for the Jews to evade justice and escape the blame for the wrongs that they have inflicted on our people for centuries by convincing blacks that it was the white man who did it.'",

J ewish ppl are not white persons of european descent, they are turko-mongolian mixed<b>  race</b>, over a period of time some j ewish ppl intermarried with european whites and after a few generations feature changes, but still dna identifies them. Most non-whites think (when they see a j ewish person) that they are a european white person. But j ewish persons are not Europeans and never were. If a j ewish person lives in say France, he might say 'I am European' but geography does not turn him into a native Frenchman, he is simply a j ewish person residing in France. Any european looking at this man on stage can quickly identify him as j ewish by physical features alone. And as we all know, all msm, hollywood, airwaves, printing houses, are completely 100% j ewish owned.",

J ewish ppl are not white persons of european descent, they are turko-mongolian mixed<b>  race</b>, over a period of time some j ewish ppl intermarried with european whites and after a few generations feature changes, but still dna identifies them. Most non-whites think (when they see a j ewish person) that they are a european white person. But j ewish persons are not Europeans and never were. If a j ewish person lives in say France, he might say 'I am European' but geography does not turn him into a native Frenchman, he is simply a j ewish person residing in France. Any european looking at this man on stage can quickly identify him as j ewish by physical features alone. And as we all know, all msm, hollywood, airwaves, printing houses, are completely 100% j ewish owned.",

Only 46% to 50% of the DNA in the 128 samples originated with the group of people who were also the ancestors of the Flemish people in the study.\r\nThe rest of the Ashkenazi genome comes from the Middle East, the researchers reported. \r\nMany of the co-authors are not Jewish, but they are interested in studying this group because it is genetically isolated (since Jews have historically married within their faith, their gene pool is closed).\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-ashkenazi-jews-dna-diseases-20140909-story.html\r\nKhazar theory is probably bullshit",

We all belong to the same species, Homo sapiens (great apes); yes, we have physical variations and cultural groups (environmental differences) but we are too genetically similar to have 'subspecies'.\n\nIQ is difficult, because early childhood development (even prenatal) can impact IQ severely. Malnutrition, exposure to types of chemicals/toxins, ABI, mineral deficiencies, IUGR, trauma-related distress - all effect cognitive function. \n\nSocioeconomic status directly correlates with IQ. IQ isn't as simple as \"this cluster has a predisposition to lower/higher IQ' when there are so many external variables.",

There are people who have witnessed a murder, been raped, and etc and are traumatized for the rest of their lives and can never truly get over it. If one incident can traumatize one or multiple people what do u think happens when generations of people have been traumatized. My 8th grade teacher(I'm no longer in 8th grade) grandparents were both in the holocaust and he gets a little emotional although he never was there. Many Jewish families are forever changed from an tragic event that happened in a span of 3 years. So just imagine 500 years of pain on a group of people. This isn't only for poc now it's about minorities that have been suffering by the hands of SOME white people and then u guys expect us to simply move forward. It's not that simple, there's a lot of tension and negative emotions that are still prevented complete forgiveness. We need to have A OPEN DISCUSSION on these things because not talking about it and acting like it happened doesn't help.",

There's plenty of factors that go into that like the fact that China is an eastern, homogenous for the most part, conformist society.  America is a western, heterogeneous individualistic society which plays highly on why the iq varies, there's all kinds of cultural differences here.  Asians who are raised here in America with Americanized mindsets have average iqs because of the lack of cultural influence of East Asia. I've known Asian kids who been placed on lock-in for getting C's on their report cards by traditional minded parents. That's also why European whites tend to have higher iq than American whites, we don't emphasize education as much, they do. \n\nIn case you didn't know, if we're going by each country, Nigerians have the highest collective iq followed by China I believe because they have HUGE emphasis on education in a lot of<b>  African</b> cultures.

J ewish ppl are not white persons of european descent, they are turko-mongolian mixed<b>  race</b>, over a period of time some j ewish ppl intermarried with european whites and after a few generations feature changes, but still dna identifies them. Most non-whites think (when they see a j ewish person) that they are a european white person. But j ewish persons are not Europeans and never were. If a j ewish person lives in say France, he might say 'I am European' but geography does not turn him into a native Frenchman, he is simply a j ewish person residing in France. Any european looking at this man on stage can quickly identify him as j ewish by physical features alone. And as we all know, all msm, hollywood, airwaves, printing houses, are completely 100% j ewish owned.",

Let's face it that's really the bare bones <b> of nationali</b>sm, stopping interracial breeding and preserving the status quo. What they don't understand is that it doesn't matter w<b> hat r</b>ace or culture is the majority at any one point in time, only that they accept and love all the others, and that the new cultures that are born continue that ideology. Like confucianism and christianity were the principles on which Asian and White (respectivly) cultures were developed, the next era's cultures should be developed on a belief in acceptance and love. \n\nLet me give you crash course in how British European culture came into existence:\n\nThe UK started with some hunter-gathers whose names are lost to history...then it appears Indo-Europeans came (various Celtic Tribes).  Then later other Indo-Europeans came and dominated and mixed with them (the Romans).  The Romans at that time were not a pure group, they had conquered <b> very et</b>hnic groups around them to Semetic people in the Levant, to Greeks, to Celtic tribes, to Germanic tribes, etc.  The original Romans were a mix of Italic people and people who did not speak an Indo-European language, thought to have migrated from ancient Anatolia, the Etruscans.\n\nSo the Romans brought all this mix into the UK.\n\nWhen the Romans withdrew, they left some Romanized Britons behind, who later became the Welsh.\n\nEngland itself, Celtic got overran by several Germanic Tribes.  Those Tribes eventually mixed with the Celts (who were already mixed with the aboriginal hunter-gathers whose name is lost forever), and became the Anglo-Saxons.\n\nThen the Vikings, a Northern Germanic IndoEuropean tribe invaded the North of England and established the \"Danelaw\".\n\nThe rest of England was Anglo-Saxon.\n\nWhen the Anglo-Saxons finally ran out the Danes who left a biological and cultural impact on Northeast England, the Normans invaded.  The Normans were a mix of Vikings who settled in Normandy (Northern France) and mixed with the French inhabitants.\n\nThe French were a mix of Romans (who were not pure anything) and Celtic tribes that were conquered, also by that time the Franks (another Germanic tribe) had conquere<b> d the n</b>ation, from which France gets it name.\n\nSo these \"impure\" Frenchmen conquered the \"impure\" Anglo-Saxons.\n\nEventually all these folks overtime condensed into what we call the \"English\"\n\nNow do you think an Englishman looks in the mirror at night and cries he is not pure Saxon, Angle, some random Celtic tribe, Jute, Danish, Norwegian, aboriginal hunter-gathers, Italic, Etruscan, and the list goes on?\n\nNO.  To them they are simply English.  \n\nDon't even get me started on how many times the language or religion changed in England over the last 2,000 years.  English didn't even exist then, and there were no Christians, people did not even speak a language that would become English (Western Germanic language) until centuries later.\n\nAnd 2,000 years from now they might see themselves as something else...maybe just European, and be mixed with various migrants from all around Europe, Africa, Middle East, South Asian, etc.  Still they might call themselves English though, who knows.\n\nThis type of thing has happened EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD.  There are no pure people.  So anyone who says t<b> hey're </b>ethnic or racial purity is possible, let alone desireable is a f'ing idiot.  Anyone who tells they are \"pure\" something is also a complete and total idiot.",

A lot of people who think that 100% something, found out that they are not. Many people and be considered 100% europeans as well as many africans, but it doesn\u00b4t many that there weren\u00b4t some mixture in the past. Science proves that. A lot of europeans have some neanderthal DNA for exemple.  And when I said that human races don\u00b4t exist, I was talking about genetic.

Indigenous sub-Saharan Africans have none, or very little Neanderthal DNA because their ancestors did not migrate through Eurasia.\"\n\n\nhuman's adaptation to the environment was small, and genetically speaking, the differences between all humans are light years to be enough to separate people into races.\na blonde <b> woman </b>with blue eyes could easily be considered a human<b>  race</b>, while a brunette one could be considered another huma<b> n rac</b>e, but genetically speaking, it's only phenotypes. There are even distinct nose feature between white people.\n\n\nI sent you some scientific articles about it.\n\"If someone looks like that and let's just say that person is 9<b> 5% bla</b>ck, it doesn't matter if his DNA isn't fu<b> lly bl</b>ack, he still matches up with the criteria to be ca<b> lled b</b>lack.\"\nNO doubt abou<b> t it!\n</b>Black people in Brazil have around 50% of european DNA and they are still identif<b> ied as</b> black because of their phenotype.\nThis brazilian singer has 60% of european DNA according to a recent ancestry dna test.  [LINK] \n\n\n\"Races differ because of features, not really DNA as we all have around to or 100% homo sapien DNA anyway. DNA may differ a bit, but not that much.\"\nThat\u00b4s why I said that genetically speaking human races don\u00b4t exist, but the distinct phenotypes are not enough to claim that there are races in human, and that's according to science, it\u00b4s not just my opinion",

For this reason this type of DNA testing takes decades to get going as it requires millions of samples to get accurate ideas of genealogy. In humans basically every person will have at least a 1% or more which i<b> s Africa</b>n as that is where humans evolved. However, having 1<b> 4% Afric</b>an DNA doesn't mean someone in the last century in Your family <b> was bl</b>ack.

I've met some very very stupid white people and I've met some very intelligent <b> black </b>people, to say that both races don't have ups and downs is bull shit. We both have brilliance and we both have ignorance, we both have peaceful and evil people. When you throw up IQ stats I wonder if you take into consideration variables such as median<b>  age</b>? Random fact, did you know that the media<b> n ag</b>e of Japanese Americans is around 50 yea<b> rs o</b>ld and the med<b> ian </b>age of Hispanic Americans is in the mid to low 20s? This seems irrelevant but my point is, there are infinite variables in this equation that absolutely effect behavioral patterns between different races and nationalities that <b> have not</b>hing to do with IQ whatsoever. Do you expect similar behavior from a 21<b>  yea</b>r old as you do from a 5<b> 0 ye</b>ar old? I don't. If you want to get technical, h<b> ow man</b>y black Jeffrey dahmers have you ever heard of? Or Ed Gein? Or Ted Bundy? I mean do white people have mass murdering cannibalistic necrophilia genes? I don't think we do, I mean I don't feel like a sick bastard \ud83d\ude02.. I'm pretty sure it's just natural, infinite fluctuations of circumstances. You know when slavery was abolished, it was<b> n't ju</b>st black people moving towards northern cities it was also white southerners movi<b> ng nor</b>th. Black northerners (who already lived in the north, comfortably) did not get alon<b> g with</b> the black southerners because the cultures were so different, imagine that. Guess what else, white northerners did not like white southerners either. I would argue that the divide was actually about north and south and it became skewed to look lik<b> e whit</b>e and black. I imagine this magical experiment where all the babies from the roughest neighborhoods were swapped with all the babies from the most rich white upscale neighborhoods. All those babies would grow and learn and adapt to their environments. The culture in each neighborhood would remain the same regardless of the color of the people in those neighborhoods.",

Different parts of the world have different cultures and environments and all these different circumstances of course there's gonna be different strengths and weaknesses and social patterns.

And social patterns are the same thing too, learning and growing and adapting to what's around us, and the people around us.

Forcing everyone to look like them, talk like them, walk like them, think like them etc. And still do it.\n\nI think what your trying to say is that many people of colour resent white people preaching white power. Why? Because alot of these people are upset and angry as to what white people have done over the centuries and still do to other cultures just because of a racial difference. I'm not saying it's right but atleast understand what's taken place upto the present moment.. White people in the colonised system have everything yet it's still not enough... y'all never satisfied. And now you moan because of the consequences of what's been and being practiced? now it's being done to you lol. I find that quite ironic.

You just compared total gene segment contrast from other primates, to the weighted geographical data which accounts for <b> ethnicity </b>in a small given number of generations. \n\nSeriously, it takes no more than 5 minutes of research to learn how this process works.\n\nThe calculation is made by looking at small sectors in DNA samples (to which we're very familiar with). Then, an ever-growing data-set which in this case is filtered to account for geographical data, is passed through a simple comparison algorithm in which reliability is calculated as accurate for the number of data points involved. I don't think you know what \"statistical noise\" means. It refers to the variability in a sample, we're talking about a massive number here (14%). Any variability is irrelevant.\n\nIt means we have generations like this:\n\n [LINK] \n\nor this:\n\n [LINK] \n\nSee how that makes a lot more sense now as to why you wouldn't qualify as a Native American? You're looking at how these percentages are determined completely wrong. Recessive and Dominant traits are calculated for, as well as their diminshment timelines for generations.\n\nNow that you've been educated, let's do a simple math problem on paper. Draw out ~50% splits in a single traced generational path for two different ethnicities we want to account for, let the number of generations reach 100. Mix and match different combinations, trying to reach 14% of one<b>  ethnicity</b> in each combination. You're free to use programs like Excell to make things easier.\n\nLet me know what the results tell you, and what you learned from them.",

Site is free, you just download your raw data file from the company you tested with then upload it to GEDmatch. (Though I definitely recommend reading some tutorials/blogs about its various features as personally it took me a bit to grasp what I was looking at.)",

For example: A parent can be 70% native, but their child could test as 0% native because the genes they EXPRESS are different. I mean, it doesnt make them NOT native. But they just don't express it in their genome. :p",

Hard to guess how many generations it goes back, but, for example, it's certainly fairly more recent than the much smaller percent of Native American DNA that turned in my uncle's test. In terms of time period though and his last full <b> black </b>ancestor, it's probably a reasonable guess that the 14% that guy has no doubt goes back, unfortunately, to when slavery was still a thing and got in there that way.

                    "commentText": "Here's some education for you:\n\n'Evidence of an unknown species of human ancestor has been found hiding in the DNA of West <b> African </b>people. Experts made the finding by analysing the human genome, looking for strings of genetic information that were out of place. This revealed an inheritance of markers from an unidentified human-like species [\u2026] Researchers believe an ancient species of hominin, known as Homo heidelbergensis, may be the most likely candidate for the 'ghost' species.'\n\n [LINK] \n\n\n'People in West Africa carry mysterious genes that may belong to another species of hominin. The finding hints that primitive hominins lingered in Africa until fairly recently.'\n\n [LINK] \n\n\n\"Reanalysis of the 13,000-year<b> -old</b> skull from a cave in West Africa reveals a skull more primitive-looking than it<b> s ag</b>e suggests. The result suggests that the ancestors of early humans did not die out quickly in Africa, but instead lived alongside their descendents and bred with them until comparatively recently. The skull, found in the Iwo Eleru cave in Nigeria in 1965, does not look like a modern human.\n\n\"[The skull] has got a much more primitive appearance, even though it is only 13,000 yea<b> rs o</b>ld,\" said Chris Stringer, from London's Natural History Museum, who was part of the team of researchers.\n\n\"This suggests that human evolution in Africa was more complex... <b> the transit</b>ion to modern humans was not a stra<b> ight transi</b>tion and then a cut off.' [\u2026]\n\n\"Separate research published earlier this month suggests that genetic mixing between hominin species happened in Africa up to 35,000 years ago.'\n\n [LINK] \n\n\n'In the Sub-Saharan region, unaffected by Denisovan or Neanderthal interbreeding, H. sapiens interbred with H. heidelbergensis, because high humidity militated against fire-making and allowed the survival of these non-fire-making hominids.\n\n'Homo heidelbergensis mostly had smaller brains than Neanderthals, Denisovans, and H. sapiens. While no traces of H. sapiens interbreeding with Neanderthals or Denisovans have been detected in Sub-Saharan Africa, as noted, genetic studies show that H. sapiens did interbreed with H. heidelbergensis in this region [46]. Brain size differences have been noted among people of Sub-Sa<b> haran Af</b>rican descent, Australian Aboriginals, and people of European descent, the former two of which showed smaller brains [44]. \n\nThe smaller brain sizes detected in aboriginal populations in the tropical regions of Africa and South Asia can be attributed to interbreeding with H. heidelbergensis [46]. These humans presumably benefited from interbreeding with hominin ancestors who depended less on fire and likely had cognitive aptitudes making them more adept at surviving in the tropics.\n\n'The significant differences in brain size observed between tropical and other regions were influenced by tropical conditions, which prove harsh for fire-making, a key technology for accessing the nutrition necessary to grow big brains. Instead, H. sapiens in tropical regions interbred with populations that depended less on fire for survival, leading to smaller brains in these areas.'\n\n [LINK] \n\n\n'Tishkoff's team also found signs that the ancestors of the hunter-gatherers bred with different species of hominins, probably more than 40,000 years ago, she says, which supports earlier findings that humans living in Africa at times interbred with species of hominins that have gone extinct.'\n\n [LINK] \n\n\n'Our results suggest that Yoruban individuals trace about 7.9% of their genomes to an as yet unidentified archaic population. This is in agreement with some results from previous papers in<b>  other A</b>frican populations such as the Biaka and the Baka, suggesting that there was a rich diversity of hominin species within Africa and that introgression was commonplace. Using our inferred segments of archaic ancestry in the Yoruba, we find that there are regions of the genome that are under higher selective constraint have reduced archaic ancestry on average indicating that the archaic alleles were deleterious in the hybrid population.'\n\n [LINK] \n\n\n'we conclude that a divergent MUC7 haplotype likely originated in an <b> unknown </b>African hominin population and introgressed into ancestors of modern Africans. [\u2026] Our results show evidence for introgression from an unsampled archaic population to the genomes of present-day Africans, and as such, are concordant with recent studies describing such an introgression in Africa [\u2026] our results contribute to the emerging notion that functional variation introgressed<b>  from an</b> African hominin population into modern humans and has been maintained among con<b> temporar</b>y African populations.'\n\n [LINK] ",

The smartest inventors and creators of the world are the ones with the most neanderthal dna. Thats a fact. Asians and Europeans have the most neanderthal dna. And you could name any asian or white scientist and then look up their dna makeup. Youll find that famous scientists and inventors always have the most neanderthal in them, even among their white and asian relatives. Just because neanderthals happened to settle at the wrong place at the wrong time during an extinction event doesnt mean theyre inferior. Quite the opposite.",

According to < [LINK] \n contemporary <b> nation </b>states who are still OFFICIALLY hanging people as a\n form of capital punishment include India, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Jordan, \nPakistan and Singapore. Also, the most recent actual execution by \nhanging in the Unites States of America was carried out in 1996, which \nis not such a long time ago; and, according to the same article, the \nstates of Washington and New Hampshire do retain hanging \"as an option. \nIn New Hampshire, if it is found to be 'impractical' to carry out the \nexecution by lethal injection, then the condemned is hanged, and in \nWashington the condemned still has an outright choice between hanging \nand lethal injection.\" (Other, similarly cruel ways of killing people \nare of course still<b>  common</b> in large parts of the world as well.) If \nthat's not enough evidence, check out < [LINK]  And that's only the 'legal' cases - let's not even start to include war crimes etc.",

If there is a God they don't have control over everything and everyone otherwise there wouldn't be innocent people dying in disgusting conditions with dreadful lifes would there?

The Bible teaches love as the perfect way to live yet society, culture, atheism, and other religions do not.\n\nYes there was the crusades, commanded by a human with no biblical foundation for doing so. Yes there have been corrupt pastors and false teachers, which the Bible actually teaches against. Yes people die in terrible ways, but the Bible teaches that God knows all of this and His grace and love can destroy any hurt and pain from this life for those who die and go on into eternity with him\nI'm not going to argue about the afterlife, but Christianity has had such a great impact on human history.",

These the same Jews you see today controlling Israel and living off as Hasidics in the US. These are the people the real Yeshua Ben Yosef (Jesus Christ) was speaking about when referring to them as \"Synagogue of Satan\" under the book of Revelation.And the fool here is anyone believing in this bullshit. Also, the hypocrite here is any Latino or<b>  black</b> who celebrates Christianity being that the religion of Christianity was forced upon Native Americans and blacks thru slavery, rape and genocide. This is the reason why the fake white version of Jesus you see today was repainted over and over after originally being painted from Cesare Borgia, who was the son of Pope Alexander VI. They repainted him into a white looking version of the fake Christ so that when Native Americans and blacks were to be enslaved and forced to accept Christianity, they would then subconsciously see whites as being closer to God because of the portrait of the fake white Jesus. The God \nthat is worshiped thru Jesus is a Hebrew God which means that Christians like yourself basically bend over for Jews while accepting it. And that in itself is very sad.",

And as for Einstein, he did not believed in the same type of God you believed in. You stupid low IQ idiot. He grew up as an Ashkenazi Jew but soon stop believing in a personal anthropomorphic type of God of which you believe in. In other words, he did not believed in God being some dude with a white beard yelling at everybody from outer space. He believed his God to be Pantheistic in nature, meaning that he believed God to be a projection of everything that is natural (science). Back during his time it was considered to be very taboo to not believe in God, and on top of that he did not want to alienate himself from his Jewish people. So rather than say that he did not believed in God at all, he instead would state that he believed in God even though it was a Pantheist God. And as for Quantum Physics proving that there is a God, that is total bullshit. Post me sources showing this. You can't. Want to know why? Because you are an idiot and you are full of shit. Fuck off. You fake Christian bitch. I rather debate with a real Christian. You are fake. You believed I will burn in hell? Motherfucker you are the one who would be burning in hell for being fake if hell was actually real (which is not).",

The Big Bang is a scientific theory, which means that it has been tested to be factual but no concrete law has been established yet since there are still many variables to be tested before a scientific law can be established. Gravity is scientific theory that we all know exist but there are still many more test to be done before it becomes a scientific \"law\". The Big Bang Theory was never said to be false in today's science. You are just making shit up. Only one physicist disputes that the universe originated from the Big Bang Theory. Also, science has always existed. Science is nature which is makes the whole entire Universe exist. The bible was written by drugged out men throughout the course of a few thousand years ago. The fact is that for a man to believe that the universe was created by a guy yelling \"LET THERE BE LIGHT\" rather than believe in complex realistic explanations of nature established through experimentation, than that shows how <b> blind </b>and<b>  dumb</b> that person is.",

Some arabs from Syria for example look very European, have light eyes and blond hair (they look more white than some Italians or Greeks), but if you move in the southern area you will see a lot of them looking like those living in the Peninsula . Also Sudanese (Horn of Africa) are considered arabs but their genetics are not much different than the sub saharans.\nArabs are like Latinos in the US they are a mix of many ethnicities. But IMO it makes sense to me to classify those living in the middle east as Caucasoids.",

It seems to me that the statement this so often quoted statement is simply a way to shut down the conversation and prevent people from looking into human taxonomy. \n\nBut yes evolution does explain the differences between peoples with some of the behavioral differences rather being short scale cultural and environmental phenomenon.

Ovarall, Australia as a country has an IQ average in line with the rest of the western world.\n\nIQ, being a measure of general intelligence has very little to do with actual education. Countless studies show when identical twins are separated by birth and raised in communities of different economic strata, and of differing quality of education, their IQ's will be roughly the same by the time they reach adulthood. So IQ is essentially an innate biological quality, not something that's taught.\n\nAlso you keep referring to culture as something completely separate as if it dodges the problem. Culture does not simply fall out of the sky. Asians have advanced cultures that have developed over thousands of years because they were the ones forming those cultures. A culture exactly like, say, Russian culture could not have formed in Africa, because the people who made it were Russians, not africans.\nCultures are a direct reflection of the people, not the other way around. For example, in many Sub-saharan <b> African </b>countries, the native languages which are not written, have very little in the way of precision of specification. So in many nigerian dialects you cannot say that a <b> \"fruit</b> is half way up a tree\" you can only say it's \"up the tree.\" The structure of these languages reflects on the people who formed them and use them.",

Recently, though, some evidence has emerged indicating that a rare allele of the MAOA gene-that is, the 2-repeat allele-may have effects on violence that are independent of the environment... Analyses revealed that African-American males who carry the 2-repeat allele are significantly more likely than all other genotypes to engage in shooting and stabbing behaviors and to report having multiple shooting and stabbing victims...\"\n\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8A3h1AvBpJM/UhE9ZldemgI/AAAAAAAAEVY/bX4NfCBpxq0/s1600/Warrior+gene+frequency+Whites+Blacks+graph.png",

There is a certain reverse discrimination that exists, but is left untouched by the media because that would be <b> \"racist</b>\". In order to have a real conversation about this, we have to look at all sides of the situation. That's why we aren't getting anywhere and in fact, the racial divide escalates. Instead of looking at the facts, it's easier to blame white people for all of your problems. Look, I'm white, and I grew up in a middle-lower class household. My family could barely afford clothes to put on my back or food to feed me with. But I made something of myself. I never blamed anyone because my family was poor. And in fact, when you think about it, even the poorest Americans generally own a tv, refrigerator, even a computer. The quality of life of even the poorest Americans is unrivaled compared to other countries. I simply cannot understand how this argument \"we were put in unfavorable circumstances (decades ago) and therefore, we can't expect to succeed\". BULLSHIT. I was in awful circumstances too. Just because you are born white doesnt give you the world. Americans are all born with opportunity to succeed.",

However, a<b>  black</b> man from your same neighborhood has less opportunity than a white man in your same neighborhood due to unintentional bias. Most sociologists agree there is still a lot of bias against minorities that hinder their success. Here is the same situation for someone who i<b> s blac</b>k and someone who is white. \nW Manager: \"Hey why are you late?\"\nW Employee: \"Oh, I had to care of some things at the home for the little ones\"\nW Manager: \"Oh, okay. Try not to be late next time.\"\n\nOkay, here it is for some who <b> is bla</b>ck\n\nW Manager: \"Hey why are you late?\"\nB Employee: \"Oh, I had to care of some things at the home for the little ones\"\nW Manager: \"Oh, okay. Try not to be late next time. No excuses.\"\n\nThe same scenario and basically the same response, but the subtle difference displays where unintentional bias and implied association plays a role in that persons success.\n\nAnother problem is when blacks underwent residential segregation, poor blacks became stuck in a cascade of poverty; good school systems produce success, the school system runs on local taxes, local taxes come from residents, and the residents have no money to begin with. There is less access to affordable goods and healthcare (not just the care itself but actual facilities), and, due to poor conditions, their health is not the best. The little money that someone just made last month has to go towards healthcare, and so on. And do even get me started on how residential segregation helps when politicians redistrict the votes by gerrymandering.\n\nI understand that things have gotten better, for all of us, but they can still get better. In other words, yes, everyone has opportunity in the US, but it's not all equal.",

So, to answer your question, no, that probably wouldn't help MUCH. My ideal system would be for taxes to be more evenly distributed across districts so that poorer areas, of <b> black,</b> white, asian, middle eastern, and all people, could receive a better education. This would allow for people of lower socioeconomic status to have a better chance of getting into universities, which would diversify the economy as different types professions come into the community. But, of course, people with money don't like their money not coming straight back to them, so they wouldn't go for that. That's why the Affordable Care Act is perceived as a threat. To us, your middle class citizen, it poses no threat.\n\nAnd no,<b>  black</b> people don't perceive most white people as inherentl<b> y racis</b>t. We just assume that many whites have biased opinions about blacks, such as \"mo<b> st bla</b>ck people perceive most white people as inheren<b> tly rac</b>ist.\" Because of this we are always on guard, and we say things that we don't really mean. Everyone does this. But I don't blame you for your opinion. People tend to gravitate towards what is the loudest, not necessarily what is true. Just add a little rhetoric, and voila, you have sheep. There are some blacks who feel that all whites<b>  are ra</b>cist, and they are the loudest in the media. The media amplifies this, and opinions like yours becomes popular. If you were right, I would think you<b>  were r</b>acist. I just think that whites and blacks need to openly communicate about our relations without being so sensitive, then we would come to an understanding. That's what the most influential people in our government are afraid of.\n\nI feel that you care about how people relate to each other, otherwise you wouldn't have commented. I think you should get a degree in something like poli-sci or sociology, then get out there a make a change.",

Besides science can't know some things it can't know what color was the first man it can't know how <b> old </b>the Earth is and things like that. It just can't. It can give all kinds of answers but we still don't fucking know. Science tells us that the universe is 11,5 billion years<b>  old</b>. Now how the fuck did it draw that conclusion? It's not a fact it's a an assumption. You're the kind of guy that never researches anything because you're so arrogant and you think you have an answer to everything but you really don't know shit.

He would have seen that humans don't possess wings and only believing his eyes (and petty mind) he wouldn't believe in humans being able to fly one day. Indeed he would also have said that scientists are dumbfucks. Sad part is 250 years later such people are able to enjoy the privilige of flight.",

Probably africa. It's Impossible to have 100.000000% dna from a single country. Except maybe for a isolated island and were they are still primitive. Ex. Indigenous people that have never seen the outside world, inkl white people. Look on youtube for the documentary, very interesting.",

He does not have to have a great grandparent of 80% <b> black </b>ancestry because his parents and grandparents, just like him, probably share traces of<b>  African</b> DNA as well.

You said \"That <b> woman </b>is a<b>  black</b> supremacist\", I have not heard that before, and therefore my reply was \"That's a first\". This means \"that's the first time I've heard that\". Another example could be going into the pound shop, then somebody says they bought something for \u00a31.50, I could say \"That's a first\". More help can be found on this forum on how to use this slang terminology:  [LINK]  I have used this many times in the past with similar reason and you are the first person to be confused, I believe you may have either traces of dyslexia or autism (no sarcasm involved - they struggle with things like this).",
