To lower yourself, your name, your reputation, your standards all for some vagina?? Cmon on bro! That's a poor choice! So basically you're talking and giving advice to us guys but you're willing to sleep with one of our wives??? Word? That's what you're really about? I mean, you're saying it to the online world so what are we to think? To all of you guys out there listen: Messing with married women is not an option! Like no, not never!!! Dont disgrace yourself over pussy. Cmon now guys,  if we are each other's keeper and if we are all we have then why would we disgrace, disrespect and devalue each other by dealing with another man's wife? We have to stop being slaves to our dicks!!!",

At no time is it okay to screw the next man's wife. Bro, howbcan I like you and trust you if you're sleeping around with wives?  Like how? To get mixed up in those love triangles is messy and can be dangerous. As men, we have to have boundaries and wives are the line honorable men dont cross. You really can't call us brother if you're playing like that! Am I lying?",

    "commentText": "I think some women get tired of meeting nothing but losers who just want to have sex. Which leads women to start thinking well what the hell is in it for me?  This guy wants the pussy but he isn't willing to pay any of my bills. When a woman brings up this fact she is quickly labeled a gold digger, because men want what they want at no cost to them. If our monthly bills together come out to $5000+ and the man cannot afford to contribute $2500 to those bills then he does not make enough money to be in that relationship. Now, you can split the cost with another man but would obviously have to share your girl. Also, many men cannot comfortably support their females on one income. Meaning if she loses her job you guys are screwed. more people equals more safety net. Maybe a man doesn't want children, but she does, this is a solution to this problem. she can have the children she wants and you dont have to have any. Maybe one guy is not handy around the house and another man is, maybe one is better in bed than the other, maybe the other is more emotionally supportive. Most men feel as if it is okay to exploit women for free sex but cry foul when women start imposing demands on men. I am all for monogamy if the man can satisfy me and makes enough money to support me and my son. When I say makes enough, he needs to make more than me so that if one of us for what ever reason becomes unemployed or can no longer work we dont lose everything. Dont be hypocrites guys! if you do a polyandry relationship and all the men are committed to just that woman and she just those men, it can work without having such a financial hardship to bare. I have not done a polyandry relationship but i am thinking about it and the potential benefits because i am tired of struggling and lousy sex and companionship  from men.",

She tries insisting no condom, begging me to smash her ass bareback.  I smashed every hole but sheathed. Had drunk a few beers so took me three hours to blow my load (over her face).  At the end she mentions she's married.  The husband had a minor bike crash and was in the local hospital over night for observation.  Marriage ? Not a fucking chance !",

I knew there were problems that I didn't fuckin tackle but I didn't realise it would turn into a battle the normal kind of stuff that  every couple has. ..like don't touch her titties or her sexy fat ass. All of her girl friends are just as fuckin bad they think their so caring I think their fuckin mad, it doesn't make me angry only really fuckin sad..  they will never know all the love that we had.

Its all too quick and if you don't then they forget you and replace you quickly. It is not organic. I prefer meeting people in real life and also communication to be real, ether a real voice over a call and hanging out in real life instead of texting only. Digital should be extra tool not main tool.\nAlso many women want monogamy and are taught hard way that if they act like they want that men run for the hills. So then they read books and watch videos to learn how to get mogonomy and are taught to not focus on one man so that men will care about them because believe it or not men like & reward women that don't think about only them. It is sad. What rock have you been hiding under?",

The fact is that we have twice as many female ancestors as male, most men never got laid and the few that did impregnated multiple women.\n\nIt’s happening on Tinder right now, the reason you’re having bad luck on there is because you, as well as 78% of other women, are only trying to match with the top 20% of males in looks, wealth, or general bad boyness..\n\nI’m sure you’re a good person, but you’re a slave to your instincts and your gender is slowly but surely destroying the fabric of civilization. We created marriage to give every man an equal shot of getting laid, but feminism and divorce courts as well as the hookup culture and sexual promiscuity has destroyed socially enforced monogamy. \n\nAnd if you really wanted monogamy; you know what guys you actually need to be going after. But you and I both know that’s not what you really want.",

Your right on the money when you say single women have 100 men on the side. Yeah, its a shitty deal BUT the best sex is with a female that is cheating on her husband. A female that wont cheat is a UNICORN. Mine did it,  I can talk about it to. Yep, been with my wife over 20 years and it happened to me to while I was out to sea in the military. Military wives are SHIT to by the way, they can not be trusted. Your right the Polyandry is not going away with all these feminist all over the place. Your another MGTOW and I'm glad to see it. Ill tell you what, my son will know the dangers of women, marriage. It will stop with him. The MGTOW movement keeps getting bigger  and bigger by the minute. I keep seeing guys like you making all these videos about MGTOW or RED PILL man its everywhere now days. Wish knew this when  I was a young man, wouldn't be in this mess called marriage. Anyways, good video man, keep pumping them out and helping out men all over the world....",

Most of the women on there are there for the ego high. not to find a real relationship, either serial daters or holding out for Chad with a 6 figure income while banging Tyrone on the side.. They have hundreds of men groveling for their attention, turning their noses up at them, Shes the queen of the silver dallor online. We know the stats show the top 20 percent of men get 80 percent of the women online and that they actual classify the remaining 80 percent of men as unattractive. If your not in that top 20 category delete yourself from the rigged game, it would kill those huge egos not having hundreds of men to turn their noses up at. They would have to return to the real world and face the reality, that they are only average as well, maybe even a little below, the carousel takes it's toll.",

As a good looking guy i had a lot of success and ultimately it didnt bring me hapiness, except momentarily pleasure.\nI dont see any point in it anymore.\n\nAltough I get what mgtow stands for , and i agree with what youre saying, i dont see how that will bring me hapiness either. I want a family.\n\nI cant stand feminism because they destroyed the family unit with their poisonus ideology, but it seema that mgtow is not the solution also. Too much negativity and blaming women. \n\nI dont know what to think any ore and how to make relationships good again for both men and women, but both movements are just going to divide everyone even more. It seems its just the other side of the coin, if you get what i say.\n\nAnyway, i wish peace to all of you brothers",

You choose to fuck a married woman because you’re insecure about how you compare to the guys who are going for the single one. You go for the easy and disrespectful option, wow how alpha for you to fuck a married woman. If you honestly believe in your current view on women, I have to tell you it’s not the women that are the problem it’s your taste in women. You attract poly girls because you’re poly yourself.

I think the more important question is what is your intention with these women. Do you want a relationship or not? Because if no then what’s the point in complaining about women who don’t seem to want one either. You’re in the same boat. If you’re looking for a relationship you’re going to have to decide that that is your intention and with relationships comes trust. You can’t presume every girl you see will cheat on you and fuck you over. You’re closing doors for yourself instantly just by having that mindset. Do you actually try to get to know the girls you talk to? I’m so super sure there are women out there who see you and think you’re a great provider and would be a great partner if they knew you trusted them but you seem to be skeptical of all females which leads to you just fucking them and moving on because you don’t want to get hurt.",

The first image that comes to mind is the Baby Boomer generation: WWII vets coming home and banging their girls like a screen door in a hurricane. After their .mil service, you see (the idealized version) of men in slacks, button down shirts, shined shoes, just to go get a burger; Women in dresses, sons and daughters dressed like miniature copies of their parents. Those guys (and gals) would be above average by today's standards, say, 6.5-7+ based on physique and dress. \n\n\nLFA, I'd say you're above average from most American men in your age range (25-35). If things aren't going good for you on a hookup app like Tinder, then yeah, things are fucking really bad for average dudes. But again, have average men ever had a decent chance of acquiring a female mate? Or has it always been that women only accept the top 20% of men, leaving the bottom 80% to wither off and die, taking their \"inferior\" genes with them. \n\n\nLooks, Money, Status. LFA, you got the looks, idk your financials, or social status, but you've got confidence and attitude, along with the masculine physical characteristics that women recognize and are attracted to subconsciously. So again, if YOU are struggling with online dating/hooking up, the rest of us pleebs are doomed.\n\n\nThanks for the straight talk and no apologies. Great content.",

Do what you want to do, but be careful of the hypocrisy of preaching against the failing of modern western marriage while doing your part to destroy it, or at least not honor it. I like your videos and you seem like a good enough guy that I'd hang out with and share a 6 pack with. I just want to drop that note for consideration. Somehow I also think you are better than all that.. you don't seem like someone who seek out that. Not really.",

    "commentText": "Most incels want love and appreciation more that sex. Incels exist because they have no social confidence, they have no social confidence because they can not confide in their ability to meet their long term pre-socio-sexual survival needs(safety, food, water, shelter), and they are not able to meet those survival needs because they are paying the taxes for all of the poor sexual choices of average degenerate woman and bad boys. By removing this unfair burden from incels and placing it rightfully back on the shoulders of those legitinately privileged individuals who create such societal liabilities, it would allow incels to quickly become confident and attractive men that can find love, which is a good thing because as more and more men identify as incels and are unable to find love, they will certainly find hate. Then they become suicidal, homicidal, and eventually macro-political genocidal.\n\nShow me a man who takes by force what he wants from women and I'll show you 10 women who vote to take by force what they want from men. Show me a grave created by patriarchy and Ill show you an entire graveyard created by feminism/communism.\n\"Any society that negates the role of the father in the voluntarily marriage contract from decent civilization buliding men and replaces it with a involuntary centralized welfare state will not remain civilized for long.\"\n\nI didn't go looking for war, war came looking for me. I didn't go looking for nationalism, nationalism came looking for me. I didn't go looking for racism, racism came looking for me. \n\nThe solution to racism is patriarchy. Moat of people killing each, both inter and intra race, is men competing for resources/ status to gain access to women. Jordan Peterson has a 10 minute or so video out their called \"Does poverty chase crime? no. the gini coefficient explained\" where he describes the most duplicateable law in the social sciences (the gini coefficient):  as economic inequality increases in a given geographic area, the male on male homicide rate will increase exponentially. The reason why is because as economic inequality increases women mostly flock to the top men. The solution to the gini coefficient dilemma? Jordan Peterson says its forced monogamy. That's how you balance unity with diversity so that society doesn't rip itself apart....\nWhites shooting up mosks in new Zealand? Would he have done it if he was married and loved and appreciated? Blacks killing each other in Chicago? Would they be doing that if they would have been married with loving wives in their lives?\n\nSEX SHOULD ONLY BE WITHIN MARRIAGE. IF YOU BELIEVE THAT HUMAN LIFE HAS NEGLECT-TRANSENDING VALUE THAT YOUR COMMUNITY IS OBLIGATED TO PROTECT AND SUPPORT, THEN BEFORE COUPLES HAVE SEX THEY NEED THE CONSENT & COSIGNERS OF THE CHURCH & VILLAGE(PARENTS, EXTENDED FAMILY, BEST MEN AND BRIDESMAIDS) TO ENSURE THE MAN AND WOMAN POTENTIALLY PROCREATING HUMAN LIFE POSES THE QUALITIES AND QUANTITIES NECESSARY TO GIVE THE CHILD(REN) THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITES NEEDED TO HAVE A FAIR CHANCE AT A GOOD LIFE AND THE ETHOS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE IT WHILE BEING FAIR TO OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY.(\"IF THERE IS ANYONE HERE TODAY WHO FEELS THIS MAN AND WOMAN SHOULD NOT COME TOGETHER(( HAVE SEX AND POTENTIALLY MAKE BABIES)) TODAY, LET THEM SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER HOLD THEIR PEACE.\") THIS WAY, IF THERE IS A NEED FOR A WELFARE NET TO HELP THE COUPLE AND/OR CHILD, COERCED  TAXATION IS NOT NECESSARY-THE SOCIAL NETWORK NEEDED TO FUFILL THIS ROLE HAS ALREADY BEEN PUT IN  PLACE THROUGH INTERPERSONAL CONSENT.\nAND THATS HOW YOU BALANCE-\nLOVE WITH FREEDOM\nMICRO WITH MACRO\nUNITY WITH DIVERSITY\n-Marriage",

She soon began to see what other women around here are doing and I didn't take long before she got pregnant by some other dude. She took half of my cousins finances, kid has child support and she lives with the other dude. The Western culture got to her and now she feels like a queen and like her coochie is a gold vagina. I tried telling him that once these chicks see the culture, they want in. That's why I stay single. I'm not rolling dices on these hoes.",

That is also mildly amusing. \n\nIf there were any monogamous women in the world do you think that they would put someone on their priority list who publicly declares that they do not share the same values when it comes to loyalty, fidelity, trust, respect?  Are monogamous women impressed with men who cheat with married women?\n\nLook I get that government interferrence in adult relationships is a drag. But that is not going to stop human beings from yearning to fulfill their biological imperative.  So you are stuck in a catch 22.  Do you make yourself miserable and continue to wallow in the sesspool of swamp dating which is obviously draining you of life force and turning you into a slob. Or do you get clear about relationships and what you really want and go after that?\n\nYou hogtied yourself with the MGTOW thing.  It's funny.\nPlus yer grumpy self is a big baby and it's funny.",

She treats me as an important and valued member of the family. This is common with Asian women. She values me as an important component of our family. This makes a huge difference. \n\nWomen and men want different things from family. Western women don't understand what family real is. They don't understand the purpose of living. They're living a lie. There are cultures that are not like this. That being said, Western men need to remember how to be men. \n\nThe big issue is with the law society and the courts. They are using the family courts to bring back open slavery. Kill the judges and lawyers when they use the public trust to stall your property. This will then end right quick!",

Seems like being married today (at least it seems for her) means nothing in terms of restraints, but I don't know about the guys and perceived male behavior. Theoretically speaking you just might be her Nth hookup that day.",

So I would say that statistically women are actually with average men as these are the Beta Provider.  However the Beta Provider doesn't realise he is a Beta provider.   I found this out to my cost the other day when I was giving a friend of mine dating advise over FB postings.  As I have mentioned prior though I believe men are wasting their time on dating sites.  There are females in my area who are on POF and Tinder who I know are married.  Now they are not looking to date, they are chasing the validation Bros.  Also wondering what hubby thinks ? Dude their are some men out there who are turned on by other men chasing their misses.",

I get that it’s the better deal in terms of divorce and heart break. But if we want to improve the situation, how is helping her hypergamous and polyamorous tendencies any better? It’s certainly more satisfying for you that day but you’re still left making these videos complaining about female behavior. All in all I agree with everything else you said. I would think the answer is to not give a fuck about these women. Don’t even entertain them. Only downside is you can’t get every man to agree to this on a single given day. If they did, maybe these women wouldn’t think they have as much value as they do.",

    "commentText": "It is rough out there in the sexual marketplace for men. I experimented with tinder too about 2 years ago. Stopped it after a year. The problem is the quality of women when it comes to family values and relationships is very low in the western world. Women put themselves and career first over a monogamous relationship with a man. They are very solipsistic creatures. \n\nThe issue is women have had so much dick they literally lose their ability to pair bond with one man. Women 18-35 have so many options, it makes it difficult being a guy.  Jumping through various hoops and obstacles often makes the juice not worth the squeeze. I could never knowingly have sex with a married woman as I find it immoral. However I am also disgusted with the ethical behavior of most single women. It's a conundrum. I understand where you're coming from. I think the best bet if you're a man in the west looking for sexual intimacy  (not just pump and dump) is to seek a younger girl in her late teens to early 20s who has had little to no sexual experience yet since they have not been damaged by promiscuity. The problem is even women that young who haven't had more than 2-3 sexual partners is rare. Often girls in high school have already had plenty of sex so by the time she is a legal adult she is already damaged.  \n\nFor a man who has ethics looking for a young woman who hasn't slept around is the best bet. They tend to have a much better value system. The problem is they are rare. They do exist however. The other issue is even these women can get corrupted by feminist dogma as they get older. There really isn't an answer on how to handle this terrible situation. My only advice as a man is to stay true to yourself and have self respect. If you do something you know you'll regret the next day don't do it.",

    "commentText": "Yesterday I stepped into the home of my buddy in Prison as we got possession back from his stripper baby momma who had not paid any rent on it in two years and she was the one who got him into this mess. Sadly the house was basically destroyed, kitchen cabinets all torn off, trash, holes in the walls, ceilings down. I walked into this mess with the mother of my buddy who is in her 70's....this is a christian lady but yesterday she looked me in the eye and said \"I hate this girl with all my heart\"!  A man who lays down with a Devil of a Woman will get his head chewed off one way or the other. Thank you for warning Men of the dangers of the Feminist Mindset................men are givers and women are takers:Reality!!   I hope men read this post and take warning.

Even fat/or ugly women have more dating/hook up options than a Chad. In a recent Catfish experiment, two people (both from Toronto, Canada) ie. an ugly 2/10 looking woman, and a 8/10 good looking Chad, had their profiles put on Tinder to see how many messages they received in a week. In one week, the ugly 2/10 looking woman received 392 messages from interested men, whereas the Chad only got 44 messages from interested women.\n\nAnd when you factor in rampant female hypergamy, the 20/80 rule, the dating game  for average, and God forbid below average looking men is look very bleak indeed.\n\nLFA, given the draconian anti-male divorce courts you have there in the USA, I would advise you NOT to get married if I were you, just pump and dump women, it will work out cheaper than being married.",

Not in some PUA way, just saying \"Hi\" and introducing yourself to women you find attractive and getting their number/snapchat/whatever.\n\n\nWho gives a fuck if you're giving away free validation? You're not telling her she's beautiful, you're simply going up to a woman as a man, showing interest and putting yourself out there, like a man. \nSeriously, cold approaching is a damn cheat code. I've approached maybe 30 women the past 3 weeks and gotten 10-15 numbers/snapchats. It's more than the average fellow is going to get, I know that, but it shows that it's possible.",

Although they will gladly slake such lust with those goodlooking men while she is in her prime, jumping from one to the next... But more often than not the goodlooking male is usually living pretty basic in comparison to the smarter successful and often, less physically appealing guys. If the \"chad\" is not living Well into his 20s or early 30s with his family or a shared accommodation, then he is most likely sofa surfing between friends or bed hopping between his latest gf and side piece. Sex is a mans drive for everything he chases... Its the reason men want nice cars, big houses, over priced clothes and extravagant holidays ect. Men who get the avarage to slightly above or below females on a regular basis dont have the drive that the \"nerds\" or \"geeks\" have because the more \"chad\" like men are simply not as thirsty as the less attractive males are. But everything that we use and what has made our lives easy as they are today was because some smart geeky guy invented it just so he get some arsse on the back end.",

I booted the last two since they all start ghosting and are obviously fucking around with other dudes and but im no orbiter.

We need to never be the guys waiting in the wings, hoping she'll come around.  Fuck validation and kissing their asses, they all take it for granted.

The reality is yes, people don't want to go out but that's why you going out makes you stand out. Men today have as ridiculously high expectations as the women because a lot want want champagne p/women on cheap beer money. ...... i want submission..... a dime...... cooks....... clean...... suck..... f**. ..... be logical..... be loyal..... go 50:50.........but i don't pay for dates or an willing to pay the cost for a halfway decent woman.  You can't negotiate desire, a woman likes what she likes and it's emotional just as much as it's logical. A husband who can't give his wife a good mental and physical f** is in part why she's looking for some good d elsewhere (it's not justified but it's sadly part of it).",

And if we're lucky we'll care about each other as well... so long as the conditions of the contract remain satisfied.\n\nOur culture idealizes fairy tale love which builds in us a hunger for that type of thing... for that special someone to be close to... and the disappointment when it's not satisfied... but it's not realistic. It's quite funny - I actually realised about a year ago that the ideas of love I had in my 20s... were mostly picked up as a little kid from watching the soap operas my mother watched. Didn't even know it, until the connection hit me. You'd be surprised how much of it's just cultural programming.",

I don't think there is a perfect mgtow and a lot of guys who've taken the red pill , including myself put up a front as if it's a happy occasion to take the red pill, as if we're actually happy we're in this situation.  I've said this to myself and I'll say it here, mgtow is not a good thing whatsoever, it is only merely a consequence of feminism, social media, and the actions of modern day women. Let's face it, for all the men who put on a front , even the ones who say they're monk, if a girl you really , truly believed was for you, they'd jump at the opportunity in a heartbeat and throw all this mgtow stuff away BUT the sad reality is, this is the route men need to take to preserve what we have left, our money, dignity and our sanity. It's sad that it's really come to this and I don't see it getting much better any time soon. Good luck to you all and godspeed.",

If you treat your girl like a drug dealer, guess what, just like a drug dealer she’ll sell her stuff to the highest bidder. All this hypergamy shit is nonsense. Men are acting like pussy junkies and they’re getting exactly they are asking for. \n\nIf you want a good life stop fucking your girl and start getting to know her. I’m sure I’ll get a lot hate for speaking this. But the truth is the truth\n\nKeep going down this path and pain and misery will follow.\n\nEven animals only mate at certain times. They don’t hump 7 days a week like people are doing. It’s a sickness and drug addiction and it’s extremely BETA because it’s weak",

Meanwhile at 29 people thought she is my wife, she don't even look that great. I'm 47.  With makeup though she looks ok. Looks like she had a car paintjob on her face. Primer base and clear :lol:. Wonder what she is hiding.\nWith every sexual partner, a womans value drops. It is like a carfax, every owner is a downgrade. If men stopped accepting it though the problem would quickly end. What I see now is elite top 85% of men who smash women until they are used out, then they look for some beta with average looks and money. That aftermarket has to stop. It never existed in past times. My mom told me that after 25 (MAYBE 30) a woman became completely unmarriagable. Well, maybe for some 60yo widow. There was no cock carousel.

What happens when the workforce doubles? It decreases wages by half and increases competition. This is simple economics. Men and women now compete against one another and women are taking on more masculine traits. Now due to this both men and women must work as wages compared to inflation have dropped dramatically. This means children become latchkey kids raised by state daycare and public institutions as both parents are working. Before the great society a person could support a whole family on one income.\n\nWhat happens when women are taking contraception? It means she can have sex with as many partners as she wants without worrying about the consequences. This increases promiscuity in women. You only have to look at the data to know this. This is just reality.\n\nAs for being possessive, it's part of the male dominance instinct which society has been trying to stamp out (so called \"toxic masculinity\" and anti male sentiment like #metoo). If men were taught to embrace their masculinity instead of being taught as boys that we are damaged girls who need to be effeminate, the Western world would be much better off and the family unit would still be at the forefront. There is nothing wrong with a man feeling possessive about the woman he wants to spend the rest of his life with. It's part of the protect and provide instinct that our socialist government tells boys and men that these natural inclinations are bad and evil.",

Women having children when they are past the age of 30, many past the age of 35 with increased health risks for the child including down syndrome and other diseases isn't wise. Women initiating 70-80 percent of divorce without regard to their children isn't wise. Women putting career over husband and children isn't wise nor is it good for society.

I actually don't want to take women's rights away as you put it but there are harsh realities and part of being red pilled is seeking the truth regardless of how ugly it is. \n\nWhen you see women acting so irresponsibly when left to their own devices in regards to what's happening in the West a man must face observable reality. I mean now a woman can murder her baby outside the womb after it's born in New York and its now legal. Regardless of what you believe about abortion that is flat out murder. The supposedly more nurturing sex condones this as a group without batting an eyelash. Things like this will spread to other states as they always do. As degeneracy continues, women will become the figure heads and main supporters of these unethical behaviors.\n\n Women are unaccountable for their actions and the Western world promotes it. Females  unilaterally have shown their irresponsibility as they are continually given more authority and power by the state.\n\nI would say taking away women's unearned privileges is what is required if the west is to thrive.  Quite frankly though many men have become effeminate themselves and are also a big part of the problem. They support their own destruction and are the gatekeepers.\n\n While the solutions are simple, It's  the complexity of it's implementation and sheer numbers of the opposition that will inevitably be our downfall if nothing is done.",

If you actually looked at data statistics and were objective from a macro scale you'd admit I was right. However most women are emotional creatures who lack logic. \n\nAs for women working I will never tell a person what is best for them. However is women working full time  enmasse good for  society and family?  It isn't. I already mentioned the decrease in wages as the workforce doubled so I'm not going to go further into that. Most women nowadays need to work full time even if they wanted to work less hours to raise the kids.\n\n Fertility rates are low to the point native populations are aging and dying off (this requires western nations to bring in immigrants who don't share western values...overtime the west will be replaced by third world immigrants as they outbreed  us) and divorce rates are astronomically higher than they were in the past. 40 percent of Americans are raised in matriarchal single mother households. The majority of women in the west hold career over being a wife and mother. It has consequences. Whether you choose to see it or not doesn't matter. Women are solipsistic when it comes to these issues. When I make these comments they are aimed at men.\n\n Also women as a whole really aren't independent. They still need men to support them via government, child support, welfare, transfer of wealth etc. Women are only independent as long as the government is still enforcing the laws. Men being net taxpayers allows women to have that independence (women in general put in less taxes than the money they get from government over their lifetime). When men's tax money dries up (and it will because current spending on welfare and subsidies is unsustainable) women will start becoming more dependent. Cases like this exist today. All you need to do is look at Venezuela. Many women fled and their lives once again became dependant on men and their money, provision, and protection.",

There’s enough girls out there looking for something fast because she’s bored and wants so drama in her life. Girls high 5 each other and brag about their slutiness, trust me.... I know for a fact.

Girls BS detectors are pretty good, they can smell Fear or Confidence in a guy. I can take care of my self and don't give a sh!t about much and girls \"feel\" that.    Im at an age where my parents passed away within the past year and now friends are going. I went to see an old friend now that im back living in Illinois that is a math professor at 1 of the 3 top collages here to talk about a friend/workmate that passed. He had to stay for late classes and I had offers for lunch \"dates\" before I could get down the hall !!     DONT GIVE UP ON YOURSELF !!!!    Give it a try, the worst is the say no !!",

The truth is ommitted by almost your entire reality around you implicitly or explicitly through your friends or family without them even knowing.

You think it's more ideal for an egocentric woman to exclusively date one man? The only thing that stopped them in the past was shame and social stigmas (which are now fading into obscurity). Monogamy was created to stifle urges that would create imbalances towards the nuclear family. No one cares about the nuclear family structure in the west anymore so monogamy is dying........",

The key word there is *separated*. Men and women can do whatever the hell they want after separating from their spouse. It's not the 1950's anymore. It's not socially unacceptable and nor does it affect you legally (unless she has a good lawyer who convinces the judge that it's cheating). In the West it's normal and here in Russia it's normal too. There's better arguments than that. What she did for Amazon may very well be a good one, I'll have to look more into that.

She earned it and he is still the richest man on the planet. Now, before you crucify me, I also believe that the large majority of women who divorce their husbands don't deserve anything. That is the rule, however, in this case Bezos ex-wife is the exception, a very rare exception at that!",

Becoming one of his first employees as an accountant, riding a genius man's coattails and being supportive of his endeavors should not (in a moral world) make for 35 billion dollars.

The saying \"behind every great man is a woman\" is often used with successful men and successful men themselves say that until they get divorced. Women will even use those words against a man in divorce court especially if she had any kind of involvement whatsoever with the company. Its okay to have hope  bro but don't fool yourself.",

You have a leg up on me though brother. I didn't ever have a father to teach me stuff like you did. My asshole mother personally saw to that,she divorced the man she claimed was my father before I was even born. He was a piece of crap though honestly,and he didn't want anything to do with me because of having to pay child support and because I was so sickly as a child. He only called and wanted to have something to do with me AFTER I had turned 21. Him doing that pissed me off so badly I ended up asking him where the hell he had been all this time. That he didn't have any excuses really,because he knew where I have lived almost since the day I was born and we didn't tell him he was forbidden from visiting me at all. He couldn't even come up with an answer or an excuse,I was so pissed off at him that I told him to go F#&@ himself and I hoped I NEVER had to see or hear from him ever again. He has NEVER called back or sent a letter after that either. Most of what I know I have either had to learn myself,especially about women. Or I have even had to learn some of it from my grandfather. He was the closest thing I EVER had to an actual father and I really miss him actually being here. He unfortunately got Alzheimer's disease and I had to just watch him suffer and waste away both body and mind ever so slowly,everyday for several years before he actually passed away recently. It TOTALLY sucked ass watching that happen to him man... I REALLY,REALLY hope your dad is still alive and well,If he isn't I hope at the very least that he didn't suffer the same torment my grandfather did.",
