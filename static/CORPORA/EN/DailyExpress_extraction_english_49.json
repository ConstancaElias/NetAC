We hope that this World Cup will have a long-term impact on Russian society.', 'The Russian state together with the Russian Football Union did quite a lot of work in terms of ruling off individuals that there were concerns about.', 'A number of individuals were denied their FAN IDs.All this combined led to quite a good tournament.'",
