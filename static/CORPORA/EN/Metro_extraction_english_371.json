        "postText": "A woman has spoken out about being \u2018body shamed\u2019 after a gang of youths chanted \u2018porky\u2019 at her as she walked home.', 'Bex Zandersluil, 21, took to Facebook to share the \u2018scary\u2019 experience, which happened as she was walking home from a nearby shop.', 'She was strolling through a local park when the group of boys, who she believed to be aged between 15 and 18, targeted her.', 'Bex was in Middleleaze Park in Swindon, Wiltshire, when she was body shamed by the bullying yobs.', '\u2018They were calling out at me, calling me \u201cporky\u201d quite loudly. I don\u2019t think I even needed to turn down my earphones,\u2019 said Bex, of West Swindon.', 'She has urged parents to talk to their children about body shaming and harassment.', 'Bex wrote on Facebook: \u2018If these are your kids or you know them, please have a chat about harassment and fat shaming.', '\u2018I\u2019m well aware I\u2019m a bigger girl but I didn\u2019t deserve that. My concern is for people who aren\u2019t as strong. For those it could\u2019ve been the thing that broke them.', '\u2018Also, it\u2019s scary having a group of tall boys chant horrible things at you. You don\u2019t know if they plan on following you or hurting you.\u2019', 'And Bex added that she has been body-shamed most of her life.', 'She said: \u2018I went through quite a lot at home. As a form of emotional protection I ate a lot and put on quite a lot of weight.', '\u2018I felt insecure about that, I would get targeted about the way I looked and I couldn\u2019t walk to school without being afraid of someone saying something to me.', '\u2018If I had been in the same head space as I used to be this would have caused me to have a breakdown.\u2019', 'Bex lost someone close to her because of how they were treated for the way they looked.', '\u2018My friend took her own life because she became so desperate. Part of the reason was because of body shaming and bullying,\u2019 she said.', '\u2018I don\u2019t want to hear that another person has killed themselves because of being picked on.', '\u2018It\u2019s the small things that make a difference like calling them names and pushing someone, it can hurt them and it\u2019s your decision to do these things.\u2019', 'But despite all she has been through, Bex said: \u2018If you have anything that is strange or unusual, I think that it should be celebrated.', '\u2018You shouldn\u2019t let the treatment of you change the way you are, it\u2019s about taking care of yourself.\u2019",
