        "postText": " In France, a surge in anti-Semitic violence and hate speech has caused members of the Jewish community to fear for their safety. French President Emmanuel Macron has made a very public show of condemning the crimes, which include vandalism of cemeteries, online harassment and physical attacks. Elsewhere too, many Jews increasingly feel under threat. Rising numbers of anti-Semitic crimes and violent attacks in Germany are causing alarm in Jewish communities, and prompted the Central Council of Jews in Germany to call for stronger action by police and politicians. .
