        "postText": "A Muslim protester has urged parents not to \u2018back down\u2019 after being banned from demonstrating outside a Birmingham school teaching LGBT lessons.', 'Shakeel Afsar has been leading the crowds who have been protesting outside Anderton Park Primary\u2019s school gates for seven weeks.', 'Yesterday the High Court granted Birmingham City Council an interim injunction to protect the area immediately surrounding the school after the risk to children became \u2018too serious to tolerate\u2019.', 'The order has been issued against chief protesters Mr Afsar, Rosina Afsar and Amir Ahmed and all other \u2018persons unknown\u2019, and anyone who defies it will be subject to arrest.', 'But Mr Afsar insisted he won\u2019t back down despite the injunction and vowed the next protest on Friday June 7, will still go ahead as planned.', 'You CANNOT silence people who speaking & demanding there RIGHTS We will Challenge all & every injunctions that are issues against us. Press conference will be arranged for Monday 3rd June 2019 details will follow @SkyNews @birmingham_live @DrSalmanButt @DillyHussain88 @Presstvuk pic.twitter.com/uEHMkRzJz5', '\u2014 shakeel afsar (@shakeelafsar7) May 31, 2019', '', 'In a heated video posted to Twitter, he said: \u2018I will stress to parents don\u2019t back down.\u2019', 'The protester urged parents to \u2018invoke your democratic right\u2019 and keep fighting to abolish the LGBT-inclusive lessons being taught at the school.', 'Mr Afsar, who does not have children at the school, said: \u2018Keep supporting your cause, let kids be kids. \u2018Our children, our choice.\u2019', 'He said: \u2018For several weeks we have been arguing for our rights, and the parental rights to decide when a child should have what information, and that should be left to the parents\u2026', '\u2018I want to reiterate, we will not be disheartened or demoralised by an injunction because they are placed and they can also be challenged and appealed.', '\u2018We will be challenging that injunction. We will be appealing that injunction and as you know Friday\u2019s protest\u2026 was already arranged prior to this injunction becoming public\u2026', 'He added he has sought legal advice, before telling parents: \u2018I am with you, everyone else is with you.\u2019', 'LGBTQ activists have branded Mr Afsar and other protesters\u2019 behaviour as \u2018damaging\u2019 for the community, adding that it is especially so for children who attend the school who could be gay.', 'The protester added at the end of his video that no homophobic or Islamophobic behaviour will be tolerated.', 'The injunction forbids organising or encouraging demonstrations and printing or distributing leaflets.', 'It also forbids posting offensive or abusive messages on social media about members of staff at the school in relation to equalities teachings.', 'A recent video of Mr Afsar having a heated debate with Labour MP Jess Phillips sparked outcry as she told the protester he was damaging the reputation of the \u2018peaceful and loving\u2019 Muslim community in Birmingham.', 'On hearing the news of the injunction, the MP for Yardley said the council had \u2018done the right thing for the children\u2019, adding \u2018it\u2019s just a shame it has come to this thanks to the bigotry of a few\u2019.', 'Anderton Park head teacher Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson has previously spoken of how she has received threatening emails and calls.', 'She told BBC\u2019s Newsnight that the protests have been \u2018thrust upon us from almost nowhere because we\u2019ve been talking about these things in our school since 2010.\u2019', 'The head teacher added the injunction was a step forward to managing the situation, after it was found to be \u2018causing harm and distress\u2019.",
