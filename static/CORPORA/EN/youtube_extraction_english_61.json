It's very unusual to hear people address how something is sexist to men.  My problem is not so much with the sexist moments in this book series (although, I must say they aren't exactly my favorite parts) but my main issue is with the fact that nobody ever brings these obvious sexist moments up when they talk about 'Sexism in Harry Potter' Most people sooner recognize non-existent sexism against women than they do clear-cut sexism against men.

            "commentText": "I never did understand the stairs thing. I mean, yes... if you are going to \"protect\" one <b> sex </b>from potentially harmful encounters then why not do it for both?\n\nForgive me if I touch on uncomfortable subjects, but let's be honest.\n\nThe stairs were put into place to prevent unwanted coupling at the school.\n\nThe founders in their time (a thousand years ago according to the books) obviously knew that passions could flair at the school  (which is filled with young people, because it's what boys and girls do) and you could have students coupling. Knowing that they could not possibly stop this, the the founders obviously felt that they should limit the responsibility of the school by preventing it INSIDE the school... at least in a most obvious place it could happen. In the bed chamber areas. (Because yes, most people would like to do it on something soft like a bed)\n\nNow yes, we know there are some aggressive boys out there who might want to press their advantage... and who is to say that the founders didn't catch people doing the nasty in the girl's dorms? But let us remember that we are talking about a world in which magic exists. As proven by the story of Voldemort, it is possible to misuse magic to supplant the will of a person. That's what Voldemort's mom did to his dad.\n\nSo anyway, they place a magical barrier (which mind you would be rendered useless to a male student that knows how to fly like, oh... I don't know Voldemort) to prevent any coupling in the girl's dorm, yet they didn't think that the opposite could be true? That you could have some sexually aggressive girls? Or that perhaps you could have a female<b>  sexual</b> predator? Does J.K. Rowling subscribe to the idea that you can't rape a man? Or a boy? That a girl or <b> a woma</b>n couldn't do something like that, even though it happens in real life? Or that simply a nice girl could want to go have a good time with a boy in HIS room? (Barring that the guy doesn't have any cockblocking friends, you can start to see that this is pretty ridiculous and has most likely happened a lot over the centuries)\n\nAgain, I never got it.\n\nNow, I love women and girls. I come from t<b> he o</b>ld school and do believe that they should be respected and protected. And I will admit that I believe that they should be protected more than boys. But that's just how I was brought up. It's obviously a remnant of a by gone time in our history.<b>  An </b>age where chivalry and good manners was the norm and expected from people. But now, the powers that be want everything to be equal. They want us to forget<b>  the</b> old ways or modify them. Even my own beloved Emma Watson says that she can accept a man opening the door for her but would expect me to allow her to open the door for me. (And while I know in my heart that that's something called being polite, in my head I struggle to make myself accept that) But in an institution, like a school that needs to have rules for the it's student it is a given that those rules must be unbiased. \n\nSo if you are going to protec<b> t on</b>e sex then you should protect both or not have it at all. Maybe in the 19 years after the school was basically destroyed, the rebuilt school did away with this head scratching rule. Or perhaps, they instituted it for both dorms. But who knows? Perhaps the ruling elite of the Wizarding World (in England) still hold on to chivalry?",

So writing a story in which the main characters are male is somehow <b> misogynist?</b> What, so every single story (or at least every popular one because this article probably wouldn't exist if Harry Potter wasn't popular) has to have a female lead? And that's not sexist? We hate boys that much in our society that we can't have any stories with a male lead? Fuck you.\n2. \"Girls are helpers, enablers, and instruments\" which is a perfect description for many many characters in the series both male and female. Ron and Hermione help Harry in his quest for the Horcruxes and the many teachers and students help fight in the battle of Hogwarts, again both male and female. The idea that only female characters help is absurd. And the idea that only male characters are in the lead is absurd.\n3. \"No girl is brilliantly heroic the way Harry is\" Ok so this person just didn't bother to read the bloody books did she? This was clearly a clickbait article written by someone who was pretending to be oppressed. Hermione, Ginny, Molly, McGonagall and many more.\n4. \"No<b>  woman</b> is experienced and wise like Dumbledore,\" Yeah. I'm falling for trolling here. It's got to be trolling. Seriously. She just didn't read the bloody books. McGonagall has always been one of my favorite characters. She's such a solid rock in the face of everything. She's such an incredible and wise leader. She stands up to Umbridge and Snape and even Voldemort and battles heroically in the Battle of Hogwarts. If you're going to just ignore that cherished character, we really hav<b> e nothin</b>g to say to each other.\n5. \"Neither women nor girls play on the side of evil,\" Bwhahaha. Yeah. This person didn't read the books at all. I'm guessing she didn't even read past the first page of book one. So Umbridge and Bellatrix are not evil then? What sort of morality have you got there where you think they're good characters? Fuck you. And fuck your stupid ass ideology.",

This is my response to any feminist who claims that this series of books is sexist to females. I'm saying that the only sexist moments that are in Harry Potter (yes, which are few) are sexist to boys. So my point is if you are going to claim that Harry Potter is sexist (which I'm not even doing by the way) it would be more valid to say it's sexist to boys because those are the only\u00a0examples of<b>  actual</b> sexism that are even there. My other point was that feminists would rather talk about something they interpret as sexist to females but overlook\u00a0an<b> y actua</b>l sexism against males. Yes these were only 2 examples but they were 2 good\u00a0examples <b> of actu</b>al sexism that feminists will not bother to mention when\u00a0they <b> talk ab</b>out sexism in Harry Potter\u00a0\nAnd btw, LMAO Nine books?

            "commentText": "(Disclaimer: I am male.)\nYou are completely wrong.\n\nFor starters, men and women are NOT exactly the same. You have to accept that. For instance, females give off different hormones than men. This is likely the reason why the unicorns would prefer the touch of a female. It's not anything <b> racist.</b> In fact, many people could use your own argument against you, saying that the fact that women like unicorns being a<b>  sexual</b> stereotype. I will not, as there are other equally likely reasons for this, and I do not write before weighing all possibilities. There would be no real way for another animal to tell if a human was male or female; it would be as hard as for us trying to tell fish apart.\n\nAlso, you noted the stairs. What you did not take into account was the character of Hermione herself. She knew much about the ways Hogwarts worked, and because she was very smart, no doubt she could have found a way to counter the spells. Throughout the books, she was doing that around Hogwarts. The books never mentioned that any other girl ever went into the boy's dormitory. \n\nEven if these were true, two examples do not make for an entire series of NINE BOOKS! As your entire argument is based on these two examples, almost every point you make afterwards regardin<b> g racis</b>m against boys is false.\n\nNow I will focus on the one part I agree partially with. That article had many flaws; for example, there are many strong female characters. In a sense, the author was making fun of sexist stereotypes. The main male characters, such as Harry, Ron, and Dumbledore, all had the traditional heroic traits; but it was the women who actually could do things, who actually moved the pieces.\n\nOf course, one problem with your argument is that you only used one article as an example. You could have gone through lists of them, and chose one with obvious flaws. Since you choose to leave out other articles, I cannot trust you at all.\n\nAnd if these arguments are not enough proof, mudblood",

In this article she's addressing the Harry Potter series, not just certain individual books. And if someone's going to critique a series, she should do so after reading the whole thing. 'Emancipation from those roles mainly happens in later books.' which is true in most series; as the story progresses, so does the character development. Which is exactly why one shouldn't critique a book series on static characters until the series is completed\n\nBesides that, why is it even something to take issue with that a story's more masculine? Many popular books series (Mortal Instruments, Divergent, Twilight, House of Night, Vampire Academy, Miss Peregrine's, etc.) are equally as female-centric as Harry Potter is male-centric, but do they ever get any shit for it? If people are going to pretend to have a problem with there being less prominent characters of one <b> gender </b>than another it should be consistent which genders and series those apply to",

And then complaining about the article being outdated more than a decade later is just not being able to read something in its context.\n\nThe problem is that by far the majority is male-centric; a couple of examples otherwise doesn't change that.

That's why they couldn't stand her half the damn time. Well, Ron really she had no problem with Harry. But she did get better in the series. But guess what the movies kind of threw Ron to the side. Shame on you J.R Rowling that you wrote a book that doesn't put a female character in the limelight when the book is about Harry. Damn yooooou!!!",

The term 'power' is a little bit vauge, because it could mean lots of different things. I dissagree that women find money attractive. However, there are reasons why there is a correlation between money and attractiveness. If a man has money, that could give him more confidence which makes him more attractive.

            "commentText": "I might get a lot of hate for saying this, BUT:\nEven though Gundam SEED was was, it was (on retrospect) a better story than Harry Potter. It would have added A LOT to the story to have made Voldemort's death occur halfway book 7. Harry Potter having defeated Voldemort, gets to internalize Voldemort's REAL plan in conquering the world and defeating death (maybe even attaining \"godhood\", for the purpose of salvaging Humanity or some transcendental thing). In deciphering Voldemort's true intentions, Harry himself becomes a successor to Voldemort (so that Snape, and many more DON'T die) and quickly picks up most of the Death Eaters.\nIronically, Lestrange refuses (along some other few Death Eaters) to join Harry, they are however (through Harry's influence) killed immediately by aurors. Soon HP climbs to power (Ginny and Snape as right his right hand), and during this time the Wizard World becomes known to muggles. It should be noted that this causes a mayority of muggles to be \"ok with it\", BUT a certain minority to become radicals in the extermination of wizards, like the Death Eaters were to extermination of muggles.\nThe plot escalates to having 4 distinct bands: HP's Neo-Death Eaters (wizard extremists), wizard moderates, muggles moderates, and some muggle <b> terrorist </b>group. War soon becomes unavoidable. Harry Potter gets a lot of people into his side, wizard moderates only have a weak auror army (Ron, Hermione, Malfoy, and most of the DA), muggle moderates have (after formation of world government) a decimated army (HP recruited \"gifted\" muggles), and the muggle extremists will consist of a battalion of hardcore \"gifted\" and armed individuals.\nThe curtain comes to a close, as the decimation of moderates (wizards and muggles) takes place. Humanity's population diminishes in this war. Finally, the muggle extremists put out a good fight but also lose (at this point the planet is MOSTLY inhospitable). Ginny kills Hermione, Snape kills Ron and Malfoy. And HP tries to attained whatever transcendental plan he has in mind. The curtain closes with Humanity having being wiped out through war, and the ambiguous ending on whether or not HP achieved his goal to preserved Humanity for all eternity.",

I mean, all of her personality traits actually suit her. She does make some mistakes (the polyjuice potion) but that's actually a normal thing for the group, think of how often Ron screws up!\n\nRon and Harry do tease her EARLY ON, due to them not getting along as well back then. After that, it's uncommon to see them do that. Hell, the group are actually pretty sardonic and give good-natured jabs at each other's expense from time to time but is it ever, ever hateful? NO, it isn't! It's the same as any sarcastic friends having a laugh.\n\nIn Book 1, she isn't the kind of friend Ron and Harry think they'll want because she shows off her intellect and at times comes off like a know-it-all, mainly as a defense-mechanism. She uses that skill to make herself feel less sad about alienating people she wants to befriend. THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE FOR HER! She's not going to be the uber-confident, perfect person 100% of the time; but she grows up and learns to be less pretentious because she gains true friendship and doesn't have to use her defense-mechanism, but she's still smart and brave.",

Although<b>  sexism</b> is there, compared to house elves being enslaved, it's pretty trivial. True, the house elves say that they want to be enslaved, but that could be due to some kind of Stockholm syndrome.

I remember hearing before that women have been shown psychologically to be more likely than males to mentally see things that don't really exist due to their perception.\nBut the worst characteristic of feminists is their complete and utter lack of empathy in regards to male related issues. If an apartment complex burns down with 100 fatalities, 50 male and 50 female, the feminist mentality is, \"Oh my god... 50 WOMEN have just died!!! You see, we are all\u00a0victims! We must do more in the future through laws and legislations to prevent WOMEN from being stuck in these fatal situations! You men don't know how good you have it!!!\"\nAnd then the biggest kick in the nuts is that when you bring this issue up with a feminist, their initial trigger response is to say something like (as you said), \"Yeah, well women have problems TOO! Men aren't the only ones who have problems, ya know!\" Which of course shows that they missed the entire point and are incapable of seeing things outside their own warped perspective.\nPS - Mudblood",

In my<b>  old</b> university I had to take a women's studies course and\u00a0we had several radical feminist talks that were\u00a0women only and the stuff discussed was blatant supremacy stuff. From the power of lobbying, to control of the narrative to ensure that the benefits of women are looked after before men (even to the detriment of men). The SCUM manifesto was like the bible to these speakers and\u00a0they openly (in these classes) expressed that men were aberrations, natures mistakes and to be a true human being is to be <b> a woma</b>n. \u00a0Open discussions about aborting male foetuses, what kind of diets would lessen testosterone in male children so they wouldn't rape when they were older and a whole array of other disgusting things were covered in such classes. This stuff was taught at third level (they can call it women' studie<b> s, gend</b>er studies or whatever), most of the girls in my class were studying to work in social oriented jobs, HR, community stuff and the public sector. A<b> s a wo</b>man I know that most women do not buy into this sickening madness but those that do are in positions to do harm to the men they interact with or have influence over in their everyday work lives.
