        "postText": "The change in name came after it was revealed that over 30 percent of female ministers in Holyrood claimed to have been victims of some form of sexual harassment. In response, the coffee shop based at the Scottish Parliament changed the name as part of an ongoing drive to reduce sexism. The traditional Christmas treats, which are often a favourite with Children during the festive period, will now be referred to as gingerbread persons under Holyrood\u2019s insistence on gender neutrality.', 'But Scottish Conservatives have said the move \u201ctrivialises\u201d a serious issue of institutionalised sexism in the workplace.', 'By making names gender-neutral, the parliament hopes to foster a more inclusive working environment for female and non-binary staff - an approach which is becoming more popular in institutions across the country.', '\u201cFFS. Scottish Parliament re-names gingerbread men to tackle sexual harassment.\u201d', 'Scottish Conservative Equalities spokesman Annie Wells told the Daily Mail: \u201cSurely the Scottish Parliament has got better things to do than worry about what to call gingerbread men?', 'This is an utterly pointless gesture which simply trivialises the real issues of gender equality.\u201d', 'Meanwhile, TV host and pundit Piers Morgan took to twitter to share his views on the new naming of the tasty treat.', 'Mr Morgan took to twitter to air his views over the Scottish parliament\u2019s ban on gingerbread men, clearly vexed by Holyrood\u2019s new rule.', 'The Scottish government have been contacted for comment.',  'In October, Waitrose was forced to change the name of its \u2018Gentleman\u2019s\u2019 sandwich after feminist campaigners branded it sexist.', 'The upmarket chicken roll sparked outrage on social media for marketing itself as a choice for males', 'A spokesman said: It's never our intention to cause offence - we're not dictating who should eat this sandwich - we hope anyone who tries it will love the distinctive flavours.', ' However, we are planning to change the name of the sandwich soon.",
