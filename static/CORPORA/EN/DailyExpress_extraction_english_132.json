        "postText": "'Ephraim Mirvis delivered the warning ahead of Britons going to the poll on December 12 that the overwhelming majority of British Jews are gripped by anxiety. The shock intervention likely to derail the launch of Labour\u2019s race and faith manifesto, which is to be released tomorrow. Labour has been riddled with complaints about anti-Semitism but Jeremy Corbyn has previously underlined it is tackling the issue by expelling members.', 'A Labour Party spokesman said: Jeremy Corbyn is a lifelong campaigner against anti-Semitism and has made absolutely clear it has no place in our party and society and that no one who engages in it does so in his name.', 'A Labour Government will guarantee the security of the Jewish community, defend and support the Jewish way of life, and combat rising anti-Semitism in our country and across Europe.', 'But Mr Mirvis said he feared the future for Jews in Britain if Labour came to power.', '', '', 'He said: During the past few years, on my travels through the UK and further afield, one concern has been expressed to me more than any other. Of course, the threats of the far right and violent jihadism never go away, but the question I am now most frequently asked is: What will become of Jews and Judaism in Britain if the Labour Party forms the next Government?', 'He said that the Jewish community has watched with incredulity as supporters of the Labour leadership have hounded parliamentarians, members and even staff out of the party for challenging anti-Jewish racism.', 'He added: The way in which the leadership has dealt with anti-Jewish racism is incompatible with the British values of which we are so proud - of dignity and respect for all people. It has left many decent Labour members both Jewish and non-Jewish, ashamed of what has transpired.', 'He concluded: It is not my place to tell any person how they should vote. I regret being in this situation at all. I simply pose the question: What will the result of this election say about the moral compass of our country? When December 12 arrives, I ask every person to vote with their conscience. Be in no doubt, the very soul of our nation is at stake.', 'The intervention by the religious leader is an unusual one particularly during the a general election campaign, particularly by one so prominent as the Chief Rabbi who holds pastoral care for over half of all jews in the UK.', 'Last week, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York appealed to the masses to honour the truth and challenge falsehoods but they included no specific criticism of any one party.', 'The condemnation of Labour\u2019s handling of allegations of anti-semitism comes as he is set to launch his party\u2019s race and faith manifesto today, including plans to teach children about colonialism, injustice and the role of the British empire as part of the national curriculum.', 'But former Labour minister Ian Austin, who quit the party over its handling of prejudice against Jews, said that the party should tackle racism within its ranks first.', 'He said: No one is going to listen to a lecture about racism from Jeremy Corbyn when Labour is the only party in history to be subjected to a full inquiry by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.', 'Instead of making speeches about these issues, he ought to be listening to the Jewish community, dealing with the anti - Semitism that has poisoned the Labour Party under his leadership and disowning the candidates who have said and done unacceptable things.', 'Labour\u2019 s race plans would form an emancipation educational trust to ensure historical injustice, colonialism and role of the British empire is taught in the national curriculum. ', 'The trust would also lecture on migration as well as how the legacy of slavery interrupted a rich and powerful black history.', 'Labour\u2019 s race plans would compel businesses to report on the pay gap faced by black, Asian and minority ethnic groups staff in order to stamp out discriminatory pay.', 'Mr Corbyn also wants to end charges for passports, visas and tests from the Home Office ', 'Home Secretary Priti Patel said not charging for visa and immigration services would cost more than\u00a3 1.5 billion. ', 'It 's staggering that Corbyn's Labour see fit to lecture people about race and faith while they are investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for the rampant anti - Semitism in their ranks, she added.'",

When jews came into uk as refugees in 30 s / 40 s, the <b> old </b>style lab party was more applicable to their needs. Ironically the tories didnt support the uk or the people they only supported those who supported their position, comfortably on top table. Personal point - as my relatives came from londons east end, when the the krauts bombed...k out of them - in area of whitetorne  blackthorne sts, east 1 - nearby jewish family helped us, and irish too., all the bad shyte was created by media and escalates to today - whilst the real enemies are downplayed and the racial banner waved over it all, basically to cover up officialdoms deliberate ignoring it.
