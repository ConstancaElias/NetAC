Obviously you were clearly not breaking any traffic laws. Then you should get a civil lawyer and sue her for whatever the lawyer tells you, you can. You need to let your children know, who were in the car with you, how to stand up to <b> racism </b>and it is wrong. It was wise you did not fight back so I would take it to the police station.  Also she doesn't know she can go back to her country, probably somewhere in Europe, but then she's too ignorant not to know where she came from and where her roots are or if she BELIEVES she is from this country then she needs to go back to the Reservations (Native Americans - WHO WERE HERE FIRST and no this is not a racial remark to Native Americans.. They stay in the reservations because they want to not because they have to). We are all immigrants here and if she had a brain she would know the founding fathers were British not Europeans. She is also an uneducated, ignorant, miserable women because she said \"HOLA\" that's Mexican. She also burned more bridges with Mexicans. This is so sad and the worst of it all is that people try to say Asians are not being<b>  racist</b> against but we know the TRUTH.",

I was obviously offended and just replied with an \"ok\" even though I wasn't not ok. I would have said to her \"well why don't you go back to Italy since you're so corrupted and spoilt?\" but I didn't want her to name me as a 'meanie' or a 'racist brat' so I kept it to myself(I DID NOT FORGIVE HER). Another time in primary, I don't know why but I mentioned about my opinions on 'Chinese people killing dogs' because I was half for and against to it BUT my same 'friend' seemed to not like my opinions and knew that I was going to get a puppy so she said \"well I'm going to kill your puppy to see how you like it\" as a another bullshit 'joke'. Later, I said to her why did she say it and I didn't like but she just turned to me and said in a bad attitude \"oh my god just shut up it was just a stupid joke! Can't you get over it?!\" . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy 'friend' needs some malk.",

Asians take the denial approach. They will see an asian get discriminated upon and ignore it. It's a little different on the west coast but they still don't fight it like blacks do. Probably bc no one supports them as much. Asians are emotionally inept. Its beat into them by their culture.",

They had small parcels of land that they could make a claim to because that's where they spent most of their time and where they had their ancestors buried. But that was not the entire continent. There were never more than 10 million native North Americans even at the absolute height of their population, and that includes Canada and Alaska as well. They were a stone <b> age </b>people without roads, the wheel, literacy, and only a handful of permanent settlements. By and large, the vast majority of the continent was not 'theirs.' Even the idea that they could control that much land was a foreign concept to them. Obviously, some whites did some very bad things, and Native Americans suffered for it, but its not as if this violence was entirely one sided. Americas first school massacre was the Enoch Brown massacre when a group of Delaware Native Americans slaughtered a school full of children, and enslaved some of the survivors. A week before hand they killed a white pregnant women and cut out her unborn child. There was a reason why some called the natives 'savages.' \n\nAnd the idea of anyone from East or South East Asia looking down on Americans for conquering stuff is laughable. All humans conquered other humans in the days before the Industrial Revolution. The only thing that sets white people apart from the rest of the world is that we questioned these ideas and have made an effort not to repeat the mistakes of the past. Albeit with limited success.",

This is more prevalent in women than in men. \nMen have the same inferiority complex tend to get into a confrontation.\nSo anyone with dark skin beware there are evils in the world.",

White people should go back first because they came to America later than Asians did. And I'm sure native Americans can live happier lives coexisting with Asians than with hate spreading white Europeans. \n\nEuropean whites need to learn to assimilate better.",

I realize you are making a good point regarding the obnoxious lady's use of \"hola.\" Obviously her use of the term has no bearing on the level of intelligence of Americans, but rather reflects her status as a Latina.  As a Latino,I am not saying all Latinos are as <b> racist </b>or obnoxious as this lady..  It is very troubling to see Huffpost and other media outlets (CNN, etc) posting this and similar stories on YouTube.  The intent of course is to inflame divisions in the USA.  The hope is that minorities will side with the DNC rather than the American Culture which has created so much opportunity for all people (despite all our flaws). The truth is that no society is free of bigotry.  Ask the untouchables in India, or the victims of the genocide in Rwanda, etc,  What saved me from being a SJW was visiting family in Central America during the reign of a Dictator. I had first hand experience with the alternatives to life in the USA.  The truth is the USA has created more opportunities for all its people than any other country..  It is worth preserving and the DNC and MSM are doing everything they can to undermine  confidence in  the institutions that made it a great (but imperfect) country.",

Never once did I mention that slavery is the only <b> racism.</b> I said that you yourself in your third comment did not experience every single one of those acts that you listed. Not that you haven't experience<b>  racism</b>, but it's funny how you're grouping your whol<b> e rac</b>e into points that took place in history vs what is taking place now. Most of tho<b> se raci</b>sm tactics are illegal now to do to ANYONE. Do some people get pardoned easy? Yes. Do most? No. Is your experience<b>  of rac</b>ism the worst for<b> m of ra</b>cism that you yourself can say is worse than any Asians f<b> acing r</b>acism? No. Some people have it worse than you, so stop generalizing; like telling Asians to 'join the club.' This is a video on a current event, not a historical one, this is why t<b> here's </b>racism to this day when people start generalizing their own vic<b> timized</b> racism and project it on the<b> ir wh</b><b> ole rac</b>e. Racism isn't a who has it worse or who's going to be next. Sorry that you can't see that and you have to just offend so many people that also <b> experie</b>nce racism as well. (An<b> d hones</b>tly, racism between all races is better, not just white p<b> eople</b>; every race has different opinions on one another, and not every white person is a piece of shit that is going t<b> o att</b>ack your race)",

They were the first people to have the vision, adventurous spirit and technology to go very far to explore and conquer discovered lands.

It is not a single genocide but a collection of <b> ethnic </b>wars which raged from Sudan, the Congo, through to Uganda and Rwanda.\nDetails[edit]\nIn the southern region of the Sudan, two million people belonging to various Nilotic peoples including Dinka, Nuer and Shilluk were killed by Sudanese Arabs from the North.[1]\nRoughly five and a half million died in the Congo, mainly during the Second Congo War [2] but also in relatively smaller holocausts such as the Ituri conflict and the mass murder of Pygmies known as \"Effacer le tableau\".\nIn Uganda, 300 thousand people were murdered during the regime of Idi Amin[3] and 500 thousand during the rule of his successor, Milton Obote.[4] Amin's genocides targeted the Acholi and Lango peoples; these two groups went on to murder other groups (mainly the Baganda) under Obote's regime.[5]\nIn the early 1970s, over 150 thousand Hutu people were killed by Tutsi people in Burundi by order of General Michel Micombero.[6] Twenty years later, one million Tutsi people were murdered by Hutu people during the 1994 Rwandan genocide.[7]\nIn the Rwandan genocide, the people who had been the victims in Burundi (the Hutu) murdered the<b>  ethnic</b> group that had killed them (the Tutsi), and these new victims later played a role in the Congo genocide.[8]\nIn all of these deaths, the victims were killed by people from a differen<b> t ethni</b>c group, people who hated the victim<b> s' ethn</b>ic group. Ten million deaths in close proximity have left a zone of devastation in Central Africa. And this is talking only of central Africa in the 20 century.",

They are starting to say the same thing about European countries too. \"France used to have Blacks and Arabs over 1000 years ago, the Gauls were not there first\", same with Germany, Holland, Sweden, etc. At the end of the day, the hard fact is simply that its White countries getting pumped full of immigration and quickly getting replaced. The Native Americans are just accessory in all this in America. Just a reminder, blacks and Hispanics (mostly spanish/portuguese descent with SOME native blood) are native to Americas? Oops thats controversial but they are not, they are just as invaders as the Whites.",

                    "commentText": "What none of you mouth breathing morons are considering is that Native Americans never claimed the entire North American continent. They couldn't. There weren't enough of them for that, nor did they have the technology for it. They didn't have the wheel, they didn't have roads, or writing, they couldn't make a massive land claim like that, nor did they try. Hunter gatherer tribes can lay claim to a fairly large territory, but North America is huge, far too big for 10 million Native Americans to be omnipresent. South America is a completely different story, but when the first white settlers came to North America, there was more than enough room for everyone without people stepping on each other. \n\nMost interactions with natives were benign. The thing with Europeans though, they tended to lay down roots. They would build their farm on land that seemed unoccupied and they would stay there all year round. Most Natives weren't like that, most Natives were nomadic, and they moved from one camp site to another. A European may have built a farm in an area where a Native tribe passed through maybe once a year. The Native tribe wouldn't even make camp there, they would just move through the area. They didn't consider the area 'theirs' but they might still get angry at the sight of a European farmstead that hadn't been there before. \n\nEven in 1776 when the US was formed, the idea of controlling the whole continent was not something they considered feasible. Jefferson himself said it would take a hundred generations to fill the continent because he didn't foresee the industrial revolution and the advent of mechanized farming and modern medicine which would eventually lead to the human population exploding all over the Earth. Also understand that at this point, many white Americans had never been to Europe, nor had their parents, or grand parents. I've never been to Europe, and I have to go up several generations before I even come to the first <b> immigrant </b>in my family tree. I'm a white American and my ancestors helped build it into what it is today, and I'm not going anywhere.  \n\nDid the US do a lot of mean and unfair things to the Native Americans? Yes, yes we did, and there still needs to be some reconciling there. Do most of the tribes have most of what they considered 'their land,' yes, many of them do, they're called the reservations. No, Native American's didn't get all the land back that they once claimed, many of them were forcibly removed and placed on reservations. That wasn't right and something should be done about it. Did Native Americans do some awful things to white people? They sure did. Raping, killing, slavery, scalping, torture, sure, Native Americans did that, and they did it enough to earn them the title of 'savage.'\n\nMy people came here mostly as settlers, and not conquerors, because from the European mindset, North America was a mostly empty land with a few tribes moving around the wilderness... because that's exactly what it was.",

Also, Asians in the U.S. and aboard have higher incomes than any other groups. Should I show the U.S. Census data or a 60 minutes video to back my data? Also, the Indians that are \"toiletless fools\" are the poor and are mostly from the countryside. Also, the toilets in India are known as the Asian squat toilets, which they are much better than the European ones as they don't leave the rest of the facial matter in the colon; this is one of the reasons why the West has high colon cancer rates. Also, the average <b> Indian </b>household in India has more gold way, way more than the average Westsrner. Indians are the largest consumers of gold, which makes the average<b>  Indian</b> households have somewhere between 23,000 to 24,000 tons of gold, which comes out to be $800,000. And yes, the Indians are richer than the average Westerners. Also, The Bank of India holds the latest stores gold in the world.",

Read about the history of Nixon going to see the Chinese president back in 1972. Also, the \"technology\" were already done by foreigners in the U.S. with the H-1B visa, mostly done by East and South Asians. China didn't steal anyone's \"technology!\" Again, people are talking out of their assess. To do business in China, any foreign business or tech company has to sign 50% of their property rights to enter the Chinese market. This is the Chinese version of the U.S. patent office. They have a choice to not sign these agreements.",

Now the only party of the KKK is republican. Your argument was so flawed it was utterly asinine. That is like saying well in 1870 if we had a land patent we did not need to pay taxes. Laws change, views change, people change, if you are not willing to change you will be stuck in the past. You might also want to look up the southern stratagem you basically summed it up with your comment. The republicans have lobbied numerous organizations to keep their base ignorant of the fact republicans are the face of <b> racism </b>today.",

For \"the first casualty in war is the truth\", Pindar.\n\nThe Chinese (my ancestry by the way, in case anyone wants to call the PC police) did eat dogs, and so did most cultures around the world. As a historian, I've noticed that diets among people change, and the chief driving factor is usually scarcity. This might explain why southern europeans eat mollusks, Southeast Asians eat bugs, Coastal people ate crabs and lobsters(bugs of the sea), etc. \n\nCommunism has <b> nothing </b>to do with why the Chinese eat(not \"ate\") dogs. The driving factor more likely came from poverty from harsh historic times. Granted, Marx was Jewish, and arguably he had good ideas; however there are two things to keep in mind. Marx' understanding of world history was limited. He was more of a contemporary activist who observed the plight of the poor working class people in comparison to the rich who only collected the profits off the backs of the workers. He overlooked the fact that wealth gaps between the poor and rich have been a multi-millenia long problem. You can say communism was a narcissistically naive European attempt to explain the world based on its limited understanding of world history, very much like how many thought World War I was the \"war to end all wars\". \n\nOn the other hand, Mao, seeing an opportunity for power, decided to utilize socialist ideology to muster support among the poor, uneducated downtrodden Chinese farming class during a period of economic strife and war. Mao merely adopted the ideology for his own ambitions. Notice he subsequently eliminated his successor chairmen to reinstate himself to power. By doing so, he also abandoned socialism. Instead, writing his little<b>  re<b> d</b</b>> book which was all about loyalty to him, and not about economic equality. \n\nTh<b> e \"ya</b>nk\" culture, originally British culture actually has a rich long, albeit messy history. British culture incorporates Celtic, Greco-Romano, and Germanic backgrounds, and English is one of the most bastardized languages on the planet. It incorporates elements form all of the above. Yes, the educated classes in post-Renassiance Europe did study ideologies from as far as China. For example, Napoleon was believed to have studies Sunzi's Art of War. But keep in mind, the majority of Europe's Renaissance came from a rekindled interest in the Greco-Romano classics. Vedic mythology was known to educated Europeans, but I can't recall and instance when they were applied/used. \n\n\"DNA testing degenerate\"? I'm a little lost here. What is that reference to?",
