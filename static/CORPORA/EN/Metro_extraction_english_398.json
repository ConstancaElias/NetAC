        "postText": "Campaigners have raised the alarm over a Brexit Party General Election candidate\u2019s \u2018hateful, dangerous and blatantly racist\u2019 comments on social media.', 'Stoke North parliamentary hopeful Daniel Rudd used the term \u2018gimmi-grunts\u2019 on Twitter and says people who move to the UK just \u2018take what they can\u2019.', 'He also shared a video purportedly showing Muslims attacking Hindus in another country with the caption \u2018Just another day in London.\u2019', 'The candidate, who says in his Twitter bio that he wants to \u2018change politics for good\u2019 also made a comment about stopping animal testing and carrying it out on remainers instead.', 'In another of his posts he also makes a crude sexual remark about members of the LGBTQ community.', 'A Hope Not Hate spokesman told Metro.co.uk there are \u2018plenty of rotten apples in the barrel\u2019 but that many candidates have removed their social media posts.', 'He added: \u2018He [Rudd] hasn\u2019t so I assume he thinks what he is saying is okay and acceptable.\u2019', 'The candidate\u2019s Twitter account which dated back to August 2019 appears to have been deleted today after Metro.co.uk contacted the Brexit Party for comment.', 'It comes after three Brexit Party candidates quit on day one of the campaign, a week after prospective hopeful who said she \u2018came from a star\u2019 stood down.', 'In a statement, Hope Not Hate said: \u2018All decent people would be disgusted by the content and opinions that Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party candidate Daniel Rudd proudly shared on social media.', '\u2018His hateful, dangerous and blatantly racist views show that he is clearly unfit to represent the people of Stoke.', '\u2018The fact that Daniel Rudd has deleted his Twitter account clearly shows that he clearly has something to hide.', '\u2018Voters will legitimately ask what other history he is trying to keep from public scrutiny, instead of being honest about his disreputable opinions.\u2019', 'They said other supporters and campaigners for the Staffordshire branch of the party have also shown \u2018hate and prejudice\u2019.', 'The group added: \u2018It should come as no surprise that Daniel Rudd was deemed a suitable candidate to represent the Brexit Party given Nigel Farage\u2019s long history of dangerous and divisive politics.', '\u2018But the good news is that voters have a chance to send a message to Farage and his backers at the ballot box \u2013 if you don\u2019t want this gutter politics, make sure you\u2019re registered to vote, and then get out and vote on election day.\u2019', 'A Brexit Party spokesman told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Daniel is no longer with The Brexit Party and we of course condemn some of the language he has used.\u2019",

Today, it's the <b> Brexit </b>party promising to control immigration instead of letting the<b>  nation</b> get flooded by immigrants. In both scenarios, mainstream parties and their mentally dense followers refused to listen and paid the cost.",
