        "postText": "A few weeks back we all learned an important lesson about choosing the right model to advertise foundation.', 'Stylenanda was accused of photoshopping a white model\u2019s hand into a darker shade to flog nail polish. They were caught because the model\u2019s palm wasn\u2019t lighter than the res of her hand.', 'Becca Cosmetics clearly didn\u2019t pay attention to the backlash, as they have now been accused of doing the same thing.', 'Twitter user Farah noticed that the beauty company may have photoshopped or painted on a non-black model\u2019s hand to advertise their foundation.', '\u2018So did Becca Cosmetics really refuse to hire black women for these swatches?\u2019 she wrote. \u2018They just edited a white hand darker? Look at the two darker hand\u2019s palms.\u2019', '\u2018Sometimes I wonder if these people have actually met a black or brown person in their lives.\u2019', 'In the images, the models\u2019 palms are the exact same tone as the rest of the hand.', 'Most people\u2019s palms are lighter, regardless of race, due to science \u2013 palms and soles have five layers of skin as opposed to the four on the rest of the body, due to their regular contact with objects.', 'One Twitter use theorised that it was actually one model advertising all the swatches.', '\u2018It\u2019s literally the same arm, all four of them are the same arm so they even edited the medium girl,\u2019 she said.', '\u2018You can tell by looking at all their nails and how on three of the arms they\u2019ve clearly edited out the natural lines on her wrist etc, it\u2019s lazy and it\u2019s racist.', '\u2018Let\u2019s be honest, having shades for black people will give them attention (they don\u2019t actually give a sh*t obviously) so clearly, they had no time to get black models.\u2019', 'Marcelo, a programmer, disagreed, saying: \u2018The cosmetic industry is super racist and all, I don\u2019t doubt that they would darken a picture instead of hiring a dark-skinned model. But these aren\u2019t the same hands, those are four different human hands, by shape.\u2019', 'One user said such companies need to be neglected. \u2018We really have to stop supporting problematic brands,\u2019 she said. \u2018I\u2019m sure after they get called out for their sh*t they\u2019ll do some damage control and just go back to being fake inclusive.\u2019', 'We contacted Becca Cosmetics who provided a statement, saying: \u2018We acknowledge the way we adjusted the image missed the mark and are deeply sorry for this oversight.', '\u2018Becca is committed to showcasing the lightest to the deepest skin tones and hiring inclusive models for our campaigns. To demonstrate this commitment, we\u2019ve re-shot with real girls from the Becca office.\u2019",

Why hire 4 women when you can hire one and give her the skin tone needed for each tube.When I was i college we had a BS racial incident and a <b> black </b>friend of mine told me \"People who look for<b>  racism</b> find it everywhere they look.  BTW that was 40 years ago and its still true.",

They were ignorant in cutting costs and feeling as if they didn\u2019t need to represent their target audience. You don\u2019t need to look for things that are clearly unapologetically there. Neither should things like this be accepted or tolerated.",
