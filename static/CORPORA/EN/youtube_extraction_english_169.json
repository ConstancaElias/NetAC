If Marvel and Disney are going to go 'woke' and become socially conscious they cannot pick and choose which elements they focus on.  There is a significant difference in the age equality between the actors and actresses within Marvel that they need to resolve. ",

Marvel is almost in it's  highest position.. so, dosen't matter, what they do or don't they are going to beat almost any obstacle, for now. After End Game, Marvel will be in a weak, terrible position. Since they are planning to change actors for the next one or two movies, lot's of the audience will still see their movies BUT others will be more susceptible to don't do it... That is the moment when the fandom should says its arguments against identity politics....",

It seems quite selective.\n\nFor example - you have included some big baddies in the male list (like Thanos/Josh Brolin 51), but have omitted to include the main female baddie of the MCU to date (e.g. Hella/Cate Blanchett 49).  There are a few older female characters too, like Nova Prime/Glen Close 71, The Intelligence/Annette Bening 60 and The Ancient One/Tilda Swinton 58.  This would bring the female average up somewhat.\n\nAlso, why does Tom Holland not appear in the male list.  His inclusion would bring the male average down a bit.  Seems like a big omission considering he has appeared in 3 MCU movies so far.\n\nI don't doubt that the average <b> age </b>of the female cast members is lower, that seems to be the way with Hollywood - but it would help your argument if it didn't look like you were cherry picking.",

They're too small to cater to and aren't loyal once you cross their wacko ideals.\u00a0They're just not worth the attention in the long view. Product good material without any overt political bias. Create good stories and interesting characters. Stay as believable as possible. NO MARY SUES!\u00a0 Hollywood has gotten so lazy in rolling out <b> dumb </b>sequels, and chasing after minorities. That's why people aren't flocking to the movies like they used to. Go back to basic storytelling.",
