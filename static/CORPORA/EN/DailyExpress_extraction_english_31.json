Enough of these leftists and their political censorship -- it's time to go back to being normal people, saying what we please, and what we believe.  If anyone is \"offended\", that's their problem.  I find most of what's going on today very offensive, but not being a member of a politically preferred minority, I have no right to complain about it.",
