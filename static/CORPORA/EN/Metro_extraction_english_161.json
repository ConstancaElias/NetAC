        "postText": "The makers of Kinder Surprise eggs have apologised to horrified parents after toys their children were given inside the chocolate treats were branded with the letters \u2018KKK\u2019.', 'One mother said she was left \u2018feeling sick\u2019 after noticing the letters had been painted onto three balloons being held by a Kinder character, the same letters to identify notorious white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan.', 'Kimberley, from Victoria, Australia, said she initially \u2018laughed in shock\u2019 at the toy but then \u2018quickly realised the serious implications it could have\u2019.', 'She said her 15-month-old son Alexander was not able to read what was on the toy but she feared it could have been a deliberate move.', '\u2018This is a massive oversight that anyone could have seen,\u2019 Kimberly said.', 'She added: \u2018It raises questions as to what the company supports and if this is subliminal marketing.\u2019', 'Another mum, Liz Cameron, pointed out the toy also had similarities to US president Donald Trump \u2013 who has in the past been accused of supporting far-right views.', 'She wrote on Twitter: \u2018My son got this as the toy in a Kinder Surprise chocolate egg! White pointy shaped character. Donald Trump hair. \u2018KKK\u2019 balloons. Make chocolate great again?\u2019', 'Kinder\u2019s parent company Ferrero explained the markings on the toy were a mistake and has apologised for any offence caused.', 'In a statement, the company said: \u2018As detailed in the note to our consumer, initially it was designed with one balloon with a \u2018K\u2019 on it.', '\u2018However, two more were added to provide a more robust structure, as the safety and quality of our toys is of the utmost importance.', '\u2018We had absolutely no intention to make associations with the Ku Klux Klan and we truly apologise to our consumers for any unintentional offence caused.', '\u2018We do not support this organisation in any way. The K on the balloons was solely meant to represent Kinder.\u2019', 'They added that the limited edition toy had been manufactured to celebrate Kinder\u2019s 50th birthday.', 'It has been discontinued and destroyed and anyone with one can contact their customer services for a replacement, the company said.",
