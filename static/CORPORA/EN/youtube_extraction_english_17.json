Exercise routines were gruelling for the whole cast, and it isn't a bad question.\n\n\nTo ask someone who uses instagram on her phone to publish photos of herself with makeup which she'd rather keep, is also a very reasonable question. Sure, she might not want to answer in which case you should probably stop asking, but I've seen interviewers ask people to choose between two even more mundane things.\n\n\nAnd lol at Serena. She's got a massive chip on her shoulder, and if she went head to head with Federer, Nadal, Murray, Djokovic or probably anyone in the top 100 men in a game of tennis, she'd lose. Ergo she cannot be anywhere close to the best tennis player, her success is preserved by segregation.",

However most actresses always get that question asked even if they didnt change their appearance. Even then, it wouldnt be so bad if those werent the only questions being asked. If Scarlett got asked questions about character development (as RDJ) about the future of the character (as chris pratt) about the difficulties of mentally transforming into that character (as Tom Holand and Dr Strange got asked) maybe this fitness questions would be so sexist. But she is always asked: fitness, body, diet and fashion. Even in the endgame interviews where eveyone was going deep on how leaving or ending this chapter of their lives she was asked about fashion! like that is the only thing females do?

Celebrity males get asked all the time how they're able to obtain their professional and personal life, they just don't take it in the wrong way. Anne Hathaway was probably the most ridiculous; the actor, Christian Bale, that plays the main character in that exact film has been asked that question all the time. Is it only sexist when it's asked of actresses?\n\n The majority of the other people simply took the question the wrong way and just looked like absolute bitches (especially TS, people point out that you go on and on about your exes because it's exactly what you do. You use them for publicity, that's why people don't like you, not because you're female).\n\nYou lot seriously need to stop patting yourselves on the back and crying victim.

            "commentText": "Here's my idea about looks in tv and film. It's known that women have a FAR greater expectation to conform to beauty standards than men if they want to get cast. AND show business execs don't exactly TRY to get away from that stereotype when casting actors (they fear losing money). Therefore the number of female actors who are considered good looking outnumbers how many male actors who are considered good looking. I'm thinking that this affects the statistics for the interview questions. When a male actor is conventionally hot, they get these questions too. What's your work out regiment? What do you eat? Do you wake up looking this good? I mean those questions are still totally disproportionately skewed towards women, but it's not inherently sexist to ask about physical appearance. Men are lusted after too....  However, if a interviewer is only asking about looks, it's freaking obvious the interview is only about one thing. I'm not saying this is the sole reason for these types of questions are being more often posed to women, but I like to think about all contributing factors instead of jumping on bandwagons.",

You are NOT in control of how any of it looks, how it is used, who sees it, etc (movies, photo shoots, paparazzi, fans). So yes, from her point of view, it is empowering. Many actors talk about how they are comfortable with taking pics with fans, but feel very violated when people take their pics without permission. Imagine living a life where if you go out in public a picture of you that looks really bad gets put out for the world to see. A lot of people I know are embarrassed by their drivers license photo. Imagine that, but the WHOLE WORLD can see it. It must make them feel vulnerable in a way that non-famous people can't relate to. But taking their own 'selfies'  puts them in control. Control... power.  See the connection?",

So within the circle of athletes you don't ask king if he is the king of particular <b> gender </b>as there can be only one king from both<b>  gender</b>. If you still don't get it refer some biological facts about male and female body, it's not just about the muscularity it also talks about hormones functioning.",

Assuming from first hand that female are worst. And some dudes even follow the \"i know biology cause i saw it in second grade\" argument of \"men are better than women cause they are stronger\" nevertheless they take away other factors that play into sports like strategy, resistance, intelligence etc. so yeah kinda sexist for assuming one <b> gender </b>is better than the other.",

The name of the athlete doesn't matter - look at most male athletes and the praise they get. It's never made as blatantly clear that they are male and by constantly putting 'female' before awards that women get, it suggests that they and their accomplishments aren't comparable to a mans. It doesn't just apply to sports. Take comedy, for example. When a male comic is interviewed/awarded/spoken of in general, people feel no need to explicitly state the fact that they are male. Female comic on the other hand? It's constantly mentioned that they are female, and they are constantly bombarded with stupid questions about 'how it feels to be a female comic'. It implies that female comedians are unnatural; that male comedians are the default and the norm. B.S. On that last point, you should look up Amy Poehler and Tina Fey because they've discussed how stupid, demeaning and annoying this is for women. They did one interview with E! where the guy asked about their<b>  gender</b> in relation to their job and the pair's reaction was priceless. (Also,  maybe guys do get asked about their workout regimen, but nowhere near as much. And not on a panel with all their costars - the ScarJo one was degrading for her because she was with a bunch of other castmates that day and whilst they got asked about storylines/acting, all the press wanted to pry from her were beauty tips. Again, diminishing B.S.)",

Yes, even you who claim to be feminists.  What exactly does feminist mean exactly?\n\nTo me, it is about getting paid the same as a man doing the same exact job.  That is it!

In any case, do you understand that there are at least a few people who are reading this and you're promoting horrible <b> gender </b>and<b>  sexual</b> stereotypes? You are making people feel like they HAVE to be emotional or not emotional based on thei<b> r gende</b>r. It is utter nonsense. Being emotional or not emotional is such horrible stereotype that It is strongly affecting how men and women are expected to behave. Men are conditioned from birth to be stoic and women are taught that they are allowed to be emotional (yet they are weak because of it). Women are given more license to act vulnerable, but not confident. My best friend is a VERY emotional bisexual female. I am a very stoic bisexual female (and I will admit that it is probably a combination of genetics and upbringing). I have known VERY emotional straigh<b> t, <b> g</b</b>>ay, and bisexual men, as well as plenty of men who conform to cultural expectations of invulnerability. And I've known a few trans people who give no shits a<b> bout ge</b>nder conformity. Yes, there is probably a genetic biological factor in how we all behave, but please honestly question and investigate your ideas of what is considered masculine and feminine. Think about why YOU think the way you do. Are you repeating the ideas of family and friends, or are you speaking from objective observation of everyone around you? Are you looking into scientific studies? Are you making sure that those studies have repeatable non-biased conclusions? Are  you open to conclusions not supported by your upbringing? Seriously, do you really want to say that this ('feminism' which is a cultural shift to<b> wards g</b>ender equality) is an attack against YOU, and what you think is the definit<b> ion of</b> woman. Are you so attached to your idea of male or female that you need to impose it on people you interact with? Just please think about things. Please don't hurt others.",

Buuut, it takes more effort and training for a lass to be as good as a bloke (who has trained alot for tennis), simply because that's just how <b> sexual </b>dimorphism made us. It's not sexist to say a male gorilla is bigger and stronger than the female. Also Serena has trained to go against other female players, not male ones. Those players put more power into their swings and less into the stupid noises they make",

            "commentText": "I don't necessarily believe in modern day feminism, not because I don't believe that men and women are equal because they are, but the feminist movement has completely drifted apart from what its original ideology was. Which was that women can do just as much as men can do; however, 3rd way feminism has taken that ideology and completely disavowed what a feminist is suppose to be and instead made the feminism moment into a man hating mob. Stating that, there are still some sexist people out there who do not want to comply with the time, women and men are equal, they have the same rights, and get paid the same. I love Ariana Grande and it's nice to see that a few powerful women still properly demonstrate equality when it comes down to the few sexist acts they encounter",

Big deal someone is surprised you are a mechanic so what?  You know damn well it's rare for a <b> woman </b>to choose that profession.\n\nI'm an arborist I cut down trees. I've been trimming and removing trees for a long time and have worked for a dozen different companies. Take a wild guess how many female applications I have seen in my 25 years in the business? Not freaking 1. Not a single female application out of thousands. They always apply for the office job and then complain they dont get paid as much as the climbers. I'm not kidding either I've seen it a handful of times. They honestly think that they should get paid as much as someone who risks their life in the freezing cold for answering phones in a warm office.\n\nIt just blows my mind at how completely self unaware feminist are. Listen to yourself for a second. Someone was surprised that you are a mechanic because they have never seen a female mechanic in their entire lives and somehow that offends you and is a big problem. You are so insanely privileged and pampered that you are bored so you make up problems that dont exist.",

            "commentText": "# 10 is not sexist against women. There are hundreds of better tennis players than Williams playing right now, thousands that have played, they just happen to be male. If she wants to be the best period, she would have to beat ranked males, which she knows she can't do. Just like they can't be her, with all of the things that make her special.\nSo, what is wrong with being the best female? \n\n#8 Is sexist against men and Ms. Mojo and Knightly don't even get it,: men that are not asked are just not expected to focus on personal life and relationships, but instead die early and provide for others by being all about career 100%. Maybe they want personal lives too? \n\n #7 Teen Vogue is a girls' mag often focusing on beauty.The boy doesn't get asked hair or beauty questions because the feamle readers/viewers don't want to look like him. They probably don't even want to look AT him.  Let's see a male and female film director get interviewed side by side by a movie mag, and I bet the female director will not get asked about her hair.\n \n#4 Is Ms. Mojo being sexist against men again. Rowan and Ms. Mojo don't get that not only do boys have to answer questions about sports/fitness/lifting/ etc but more importantly they have to answer questions about career path/plans, cars, etc. \n\nThe Arianna Grande question was not gendered, it was genred, If she was a college prof. or a circuit court judge, she wouldn't have gotten asked it.  She looks like and sings to a person that cares about make up and phones. Just like plenty of male stars look like they could get asked about choosing between their stupid expensive toys/hobbies. Pretty sure someone could ask one if it's his gun or his guitar . But <b> nobody </b>would cry sexist.\n<b> \nSexism</b> against women exists, there are even some examples here in the video, but overall this entitled video is why people should be egalitarians not feminists. Equality, not assuming men have it better.\nFinally, boo hoo for celebrities and CEOs, I would rather see a video about working women standing up for themselves.",

There are people that watch the <b> Red<b>  </b</b>>Carpet that want to know that fact.\n2. It is a plug/promotion for the designer.\n3. Most of the time the dresses are loaned one of a kind, so the designer should already get creditt and the aforementioned promotional mention or their work.\n\nThe reason men are not asked this question is often are;\n\n1. Almos<b> t nobod</b>y cares. Most tuxedos look pretty much the same, and \n2. Because tuxedos can be worn more than once, unlike dresses, which have to be different every time for every movie and actress.\n\nThe reason the dress is panned up from the feet Is people want to see the full dress and how it fits.\n\n3. The reason why women are asked about how they get into their tones psychical shape is (say it    with me) people want to know how they can achieve the same results. Also, actors are asked this question all the time. The press raves about how buff the guys are when the put on muscle for movies.\n\n4. The underwear question the  Scarlet Johansen was asked about h<b> er Bla</b>ck Widow costume would be asked of anyone reguardless<b>  of </b>sex of it is skin tight.\n\n5.

            "commentText": "I see people saying it's not sexist to say best female because she is a <b> woman,</b> but the point is that the title was \"best sports PERSON\" so in that category it's self she is being judged alongside men. Refering to it as \"best female\" doesnt take into consideration the men she beat to earn that title. She is one of the greatest athletes to ever live, male or female. To only ever judge her in a purely female category diminishes her accomplishments. People say things like \"You're just a girl\" all the time to make women feel lesser, so that's why we fight to be recognised as on a par with men. Men, you're already told you're powerful all the time so no, it's not as sexist If you say \"best male athlete\". In this world having it pointed out that you're a man does not diminish you, it actually empowers you more. But having it pointed out that you're a<b>  woman</b> is the reason why we still have <b> a gende</b>r pay gap.",

Literally no <b> woman </b>or man ever wants to seriously know how to fit into the suit she used.\n\nThe fact that he asked that question instead of her performance and how she thought of the character while playing her was simply just unnecessary. The fact that you're seriously trying to justify such a stupid and uninteresting question has got me baffled. Can you see why that question would be annoying? What if you were asked the same question over and over again? The question being about your body and your diet to the point where you realize how stupid it is to be asked that. Can you see how stupid it is and how annoying it must be for actresses not to be taken seriously in interviews and be getting the ridiculous questions that for some reason concerns their bodies?",

Refering to it as \"best female\" doesnt take into consideration the men she beat to earn that title. She is one of the greatest athletes to ever live, male or female. To only ever judge her in a purely female category diminishes her accomplishments. People say things like \"You're just a girl\" all the time to make women feel lesser, so that's why we fight to be recognised as on a par with men. Men, you're already told you're powerful all the time so no, it's not as sexist If you say \"best male athlete\".

They are not great scientists, or <b> doctors </b>or politicians, the vast majority were entertainers, and apart from the less attractive sports people, successes because of how they look, yet find questions on appearance so misogynistic?? Scarlet Johanssen  is such an appalling bad actress that she would never have got a job if she was not so hot that 90% of all guys first thought is god i'd love to ferk that. She is dehumanised to a that, in men's minds, not even a her, because a her would entail having a personality that was also attractive. Now while I do not take pride in that remark, or even defend it as anything but shockingly sexist, I am pretty confident if you got enough men drunk enough to be honest, they would admit it is true. When a girl drools over Chris Hemsworth in the same way, that is cutesy and just funning around. Sorry, I am too<b>  old</b> to care about anybody's bullshite feelings, and will stick to reality and honesty. Cate Blanchet chastising the camera man for panning down was a case of idiocy, they were showing the womens gowns, not using xray vision to take sexy ankle shots for the ankle porn site. SJW's need to lighten the fek up, then eat a bag of concrete and harden up.",

But it manifest in an inevitable way and utterly destroyed the next 2 cycles of Marxism. \n\n\nFeminism seems to use the same \"saintly oppressed vs evil oppressor\" power-source.

The term implies equality and anything that goes beyond it can't be considered a part of it. A bunch of brainwashed losers don't become feminists just because they self-proclaime as such. It's as if started to spit on people insisting that I do so because I'm a quantum presbyterian or if I committed mass murder and blamed it on my<b>  nation</b> (hint, not because you belong to or have the potential to belong to a group your ideas and procedures can be extrapolated to others). I don't blame Austria for giving us Hitler or Georgia for Stalin, why should we blame faminism for being exploited AS A LABEL by stupid women?",

Really, because my thoughts are different and that makes me a sexist? You're the one that doesn't think on your own. Women cannot be equal to men. Did you know that numbers show each year that women and men earn ALMOST even money? No right, because the media says something completely different. Men make more hours and have more responsibilities, so more money! But because of this problem, women are more likely to get a job now because \u2018Oh, women are so sad'. Boys in elementary school are being extremely oppressed. These boys cannot be boys anymore, because when they act like one they get labeled with things like adhd. This is extremely unhealthy, because this is in their nature. BUT girls for instant: they're calm, they play with dolls, they're the PERFECT example how everyone should be, so boys are getting forced to act like this! Women have more rights in a divorce, men commit more suicide. It's horrible, I have hundreds of more examples. Men are being oppressed and have less rights. Stand by your manhood guys, don't let a women use you. And girls, act like a lady; that way you'll achieve a lot more.",

In many parts of nature there are female lead groups (lions, elephants, killer whales) and there are herd animals, in which a friendly male has a higher status than a macho male, cause he supports the entire group. An example for the last one is a human <b> ape </b>species, I think it was Bonobo or chimpanzee, so one of our closest relative. And by the way the alpha wolf myth is not even true. A wolf pack is lead by a couple (not single male) and this couple is not chosen, because of its aggression, but because of its capability to hold the group together.\n Yes, you are right that more man commit suicide and that it is a side effect of feminism, but in a completely different way, than you said. Women nowadays can life perfectly well without a man, which leaves more man alone. But because man do not openly talk about emotions with other man, because of manly stereotypes, and women not being available all the time to talk about feelings to like they used to be, men start to lock their emotions away, which leads to them getting depressed, cause they can't open up (again manly stereotypes) and then they kill themselves. Without the \"Men don't show emotions\" bullshit there would be far less suicides. And feminists are trying to tackle this specific issue.\nAnd that this stereotype is idiotic can easily be seen by the fact, that in Sparta (war centered, still seen as incredibly manly culture nowadays) soldiers, who didn't cry during funerals, were considered weak, unemotional and not fit to serve in a group, and people, we would consider alpha males, were seen as to aggressive and selfish to lead a troop. And some of the most powerful leaders are known as very emotional people, for example Marc Aurel, Alexander the Great, Augustus and Abraham Lincoln. \nSo the strong alpha male, aggressive leader type is basically bullshit, because aggression might let you control a group, but only temporarly until they rise against you, while compassion can allow you to actually lead a group. And in the long run it will hurt you more than anyone around you.",

But people think that that is how it is, which is why feminism is important. That main aim is to first see an individual person instead of a<b>  gender</b>. An example is me, while studying physics. Though there are less women than men in my course, the ratio is far better than most people think (~40:60). But when I am in a group of otherwise only men and we are getting questioned about a subject by a male tutor, I always get the easiest questions. But I can answer all of his questions, not just the easiest ones. Even though this might seem like good thing for me, I actually hate it, because I have an advantage, which I simply don't need and don't want, I am obviously perceived as less capable, even though I study it just like the others, and the others hate me, because I have an advantage. In an ideal world I would be asked the difficult questions as well (which is what the female tutors do), because they would judge me based on the fact, that I study physics, not on the fact that I have boobs.\nThat is why feminism is important.

Men are often told to 'man up' and not show emotions or 'weakness', especially when they need to talk to someone about their feelings. Men tend to have a more superficial relationship, where it is often about being the strongest and toughest (in some places), while for women to talk about their feelings is usually more accepted and so they can open up and thus are more likely to have a deeper relationship to those around them. This often applies to large cities, but can also be seen on the country side. Additionally it does not mean that it is always like this, but it still more often happens to men than to women, that they don't get the emotional support. It is actually something multiple studies have shown before. So men with a hormonal issue fall often deeper than women with the same issues, because society failed them. And that has to be changed. Suicide is far less likely in people, who know they are accepted (comparison between gays, who are accepted by their family and friends showed that they were less likely to commit suicide, than a heterosexual boy, while those who were not accepted, were far more likely to kill themself).

But humans, who are social creatures, have empathy and compassion, so they can understand someone elses emotion, otherwise living with others would not be possible. The thought, that others can not understand or simply don't want to understand your emotions, which is why you should keep them to yourself, is taught, it is not natural. And that sharing your feelings can help you understand them and also feel accepted and over all better, is simply proofen by the fact, that therapy or self-help-groups help. And yes <b> common </b>emotion pass, but trauma or depression so everything severe enough does not pass. But men are taught, that they will pass as well and just swallow them, until they are too big, too powerfull to keep down and overwhelm them, leading to suicide. Women talk about them before this happens, so they rarely get to the point of suicide. Actually countries with less close and personal social structure tend to have higher suicide rates. So keeping emotions in can be unhealthy and is unnatural, no matter the<b>  gender</b>. As I already said, our brains are far to similiar to allow such big differences naturaly.\nPS: By the way, you first said, you and your friends talk about feelings all the time, now you said you don't.

                    "commentText": "@Clash Gamer Hey! I would just like to point out that while male suicide rates are higher, females attempt suicide more often. This is because females tend to choose less severe methods that are more likely to be reversed (ex. overdose) whereas men tend to gravitate towards more violent, irredeemable methods (ex. jumping off a bridge). Because of this, more men actually die after their attempt and more women are able to be saved. This fact only proves that both genders are oppressed in ways that are outdated and should not be active in today's society. Yet they are because much of society is learned and taught, so the change takes a while to come into place.\nAlso, while females tend to gravitate towards their support groups (friends and family) in times of need and men tend to isolate themselves, it has been shown that as the social creatures humans are, it is more healthy for us to confide in others. As is mentioned elsewhere in this chain, one of the prime human characteristics is the ability to be empathetic, and although this instinct has been often tamped down in boys and men (consciously or just because no one else was doing it), it is still present and still incredibly healthy to have people to confide in when needed.\nFinally, I don't believe hotpink51 was saying that men aren't allowed to be men, just that men don't have to conform to the typical ideals presented as masculinity 100% of the time. Men can also express themselves in ways that have been traditionally reserved for women, perhaps being interested in design, liking makeup, or anything else that they like. It is a great evolution that people have more freedom to express themselves however they see fit in the way that best represents them. Have a nice day.",

And it helped alot, cause it shows that the person you talk to cares and that you and your emotions are valid, are OK. And once you accepted them, you can tackle them. Pushing them down, denying them, is not gonna make them dissappear. An example is the death of someone you loved. If you deny yourself the sadness and push it away, it will stay for you for much longer, than if you accept the death and the sadness and live trough it. Some people rather grief alone, which is OK, but most people want to talk about the person they lost, and thus about the feelings they lost with them. But both types accept the sadness, don't just swallow it. And there is no difference between genders, just slight personal differences. A friend of mine with less severe issues has chosen therapy, because he prefers talking, while I still am not in any therapy, cause I prefer to face problems my own way and then try it traditionally if it doesn't work.

She barely has any screen time and there's not much to her character. RDJ's Tony Stark, on the other hand, is one of the main characters in all of the Avengers movies. He's constantly leading them and has much more development and much more personality. His character is overall much more interesting.\nI doubt it had anything to do with the fact that they're women. People are just looking for the smallest fucking reason to call \"mysoginy\".\n\nSure, some of the questions here are terrible and asking anyone if he can \"wear underwears in his/her suit\" is utterly stupid and disgusting.",

But, one thing that bothered me about a few of these situation is that some of these questions weren't <b> gender </b>specific in a sexist way, because yes it may be only women that are asked these questions, but it's more because they better apply or sometimes only apply. But I do agree the phone vs makeup one was kinda messed up. But a fairly good example in terms of my point is Scarlett Johansson, now I am as excited for the eventual<b>  black</b> widow movie as anyone, but a question about under garments just doesn't apply to an armoured war suit (iron man), or a military tactical out fit such as Cap. So I feel that while the question was a bit odd it wasn't sexist. But maybe I was missing the point, because her costume is very skin tight, and well so Is Spidermans and that's all I can think of at the moment. But yeah for the most part I could see th<b> e sexis</b>m in several of these questions, just some of the reactions may have been a bit extreme, but then again I don't get offended easy so that might just be me, been going on for way to long so I should probably end this and maybe delete it, but no... I'm interested in what you all think. So don't forget to use specific examples and details when making a point for easy understanding and trying to keep a peaceful environment. Thanks!",

Like, not really because of the question, that's sort of expected in this video and it's so typical, but I kind of want to slap them and give them a lecture about their response to Ariana's answer. At first, they act as if the fact that girls do not really care that much about makeup and phones is a surprise and a lesson for women, as if women don't already know. But even more than that, when Ariana continues to call out their <b> sexism,</b> they act all surprised and offended, and even when she tells them straight out that they need to brush up on equality, they say \"no, I don't!\" as i their ignorant lil' asses have any right to judge whether their ignorant or not.",

Guess what, I helped him finished four projects during three months internship period, and I was not allowed to help him finish the other projects for no reasons.

They were imagined like that by men, that's the issue. But films now try to somewhat do justice. I'm not a huge DC fan but being a Marvel addict I can guarantee you that Natasha's story is not just assassinations and feelings for hulk. Even in the comics that started this controversy, she is very well developed and has so much more to be discussed in interviews, like her past with bucky barnes and how she felt about it in Winter Soldier, or even sth general like how<b>  crazy</b> does it feel to all of a sudden be in the middle of a cosmic war without having any special powers like most of the other avengers. There are plenty of topics to draw from, the interviewers just choose not to. And if we're honest, jeremy renner's part in the avengers is way  smaller but he was never asked questions about his underwear.\n\nAnd as someone said above, the ideal is to be able to express your sexuality through your appearance or your work if you want, without being shamed for it. And this just does not happen, not just for women (but especially, since female sexuality seems to be far more triggering, still)",

And to be completely honest I don't find the portrayal of any of the female characters in marvel films sexist, so I think the producers did a good job in not only displaying their bodies (even if their backstories are weakened, but that kind of makes sense, since not everything could fit in a two hour movie full of individial heroes each with their own lengthy past)\nAnd no, the question to Hemsworth about his routine was not sexist and neither was the diet question to anne hathaway. BUT the fact that although she did answer and moved on, the interviewer kept asking over and over when she clearly didn't wish to focus on that, is at least disrespectful. And what would make it sexist is the fact that if it was tom hardy or Hemsworth or pratt, and they said directly or indirectly \"you know let's just talk a bit more about my character\" the interviewer would almost certainly comply at once.",

Men and women both avidly enjoy and use makeup. I think this question was more just a question based on ariana herself as it is no secret that she uses makeup. I don't think they would ask this same question to a girl who never wears makeup but I could see them asking it to a man who wears a lot of makeup. I don't see it as a gendered question at all but maybe a personalized one?",

It's sexist when done towards women because there is an inherent bias women as a group experience in society that leads to those questions being SPECIFICALLY aimed at women.

Men's status as human beings is/has always been seen as the creator/leader/jack of all trades (men are the leaders of the culture, and it has been structured to serve men), which means they can be seen a<b> s sexua</b>l, physically attractive AND capable of being human and at the forefront of society, while women have not been granted the same privilege. The personhood of the ma<b> le s</b>ex has never been a question. For wom<b> en, sex</b>ual objectification is literal, whereas men have been socially taught (and constantly reaffirmed by the media, politics, and every other societal institution) that women aren't equal, but rather secondary tools that can be used and exploited and here for their advantage.

I agree on what you're saying in a whole, but I also believe that even if a question isn't seen as sexist if it's about a man's looks or like, 'what they did to get fit for their role' or whatever (like so many actresses have been asked), it is still a sexist question. It is obvious that men get asked the more serious questions and women get asked about their outfit, which is also obviously sexist, but if the questions were switched to the men getting asked about their outfits and the women are asked the deeper questions, then good for the women because they're finally being seen as serious people rather than someone who doesn't know anything except about what they're wearing; but then how is that not being 'sexist' or whatever towards the male? If we're looking for equality, even if what I'm saying doesn't make sense or it's not a real example of <b> sexism </b>towards men, then the simplest way to put it is for interviewers to just stop asking stupid questions and give everyone a chance to answer a more \"difficult\" question or something that they need a better developed answer than just having to say who they are/aren't dating or what they're wearing... It of course sounds simpler than it really is, and I may just be completely stupid in how <b> 'sexism</b> works' so, sorry but that's just how I think......",

In other words, society should be geared towards seeing people as individuals, not as a mass to be pressured into looking the same, thinking the same and following a certain lifestyle because it's what someone else wants in a person.",

Hats off for the witty answers! \nNumber ten, the Serena Williams one on the other hand is off the rails. She played against women exclusively, and had all those great results in competitions where men were excluded from. Take a hint from chess: there are open tournaments, which means anybody (men and women alike) can attend. When a <b> woman </b>wins such a tournament, she will be called the best player of the event (not the best female player). E.g., Judit Polg\u00e1r or Hou Yifan were/are regularly invited to top open tournaments, because they were/are among the best chess players in the world. The world champion is Magnus Carlsen, because he won the series for the OPEN title. He is not the man world champion, he is the world champion. There is no such thing as man world champion, and<b>  nobody</b> calls Magnus Carlsen the best male chess player. There is however a title called<b>  \"woma</b>n world champion\". I don't care who t<b> he wom</b>an world champion is, because that title is meaningless, and in my opinion, offensive to women. Hou Yifan expressed the same opinion when she rejected to fight for that title. \nIf Serena Williams is offended to be called one of the best female athletes of all time, then she should take a leaf out of Judit Polg\u00e1r's and Hou Yifan's book, and compete against all tennis players, regardless of th<b> eir gen</b>der.  Until then: the question was justified.",

Simply due to evolution it takes alot more training for a professional sportwomen to get to the same level as a professional sportsman. Yes some women probably could beat men at certain sports, but take a male shotputter and female shotputter, first of all isn't the female shotputt smaller (I may be wrong), either way.

WTF is that? \n3) Some of the questions had no reason to be up in arms about... I think some celebs just want to make a stink about small things because it gets them more likes on social media. \n4) The viewers watching these interviews are predominantly female... if there'are any objections to be had, celebs need to ask the female audience why they want to know about balancing their career, workouts, and underwear. \n\nBelieve me, most guys don't give a flying fuck about these questions.",

Google \"the girl of the fortress\" if you need sources. And if you think that indeed she asked for it, then my friend you're a mysoginist. \n2. Prove me that wage gap is a false. Because as far as I know it's very much true - even actresses get paid less than actors, just see what Maryl Streep has to say about it. Or look up experiences online, if you don't have any female friends to ask to.\n3. Someone catcalling is offensive, and shouldn't fall under the \"free speech\" cathegory. I wonder what you would think of a man telling you, while you walk on the street, while he's following you from a car, that you have a nice ass and you should suck his d*ick.

This is the reason why women's swimwear has pockets for bra pads instead- so we don't have to wear undergarments. If you find a <b> woman </b>in a diving suit, you would not ask about their undergarment if you know this fact, or even call her a bitch. It's the same with the actors in movie, it's their costume- they need to fill in a role, to be not only the eye candy but a character with a story.

Swimming while wearing one that's not skintight is even more dangerous since it will only float up and reveal everything under it. Of course it will be different if you are talking about bikinis and all that, but I have to say that's different, because here I'm not talking about dressing up to catch attention. I'm talking about dressing up for occupation- mind you, it's not like prostitution, the actress doesn't violate any morality. Scarlett Johanson here is dress up for the movie and the action, it's not like she is filming porn. They don't even emphasize her private parts! You are calling her a bitch just because her costume is skintight? Excuse you, Ryan Renold wore a skintight suit in Deadpool and even have his butt shot on the camera plenty of times, I see no one shaming him as a fuckboy.

If you do research THERE ARE REASONS WHY SPORTSWEAR ARE SKINTIGHT FOR WOMEN. Here is some problems I have encountered when I use a loose pants while doing gymnastic. There are some movements where you need to lift your legs straight up pointing to the sky, and what happened? We reveal all those tights, that all adult said to all girls not appropriate to do. Men doesn't have to worry about revealing their chest or their tights, the only private thing there is to hide is the buldges between the leg. And when it's for profesional use, EVEN MEN WEAR SKINTIGHT CLOTHES; FIGURE SKATING, DANCERS, YOGA, TRAPEZE, THERES A LOT. The real profesional USE the skintight uniform because those are DESIGNED for the sports they are doing. There are sience, calculation, and reasons behind every design, to make the movemnt clear to deliver, to make it lighter to use, to make it easier to move, that doesn't apply only to women! If a <b> woman </b>wears a super thight clothes and plays basketball, okay that's<b>  weird</b>. But have you ever seen <b> a woma</b>n wearing a shirt while doing figure skating during their competition? Mind you, it's not comfortable wearing skintight uniform because they are not exactly designed to keep them warm, but they need to wear it to emphasize the movement and decrease the weight.",

There are also some male celebrities who cannot live without both of these things.\nAlso, being vulgar != a cool comeback.\nAlso, today the word feminism is dirtier than ever before, because today's feminism is devoid of its relevance and of everything it used to mean, unlike in the '70-s.",

a thick jumpsuit and it's not entertaining for me to watch because there isn't a plot and it's not a good story\n\nNow Deadpool that was a great movie and I did not watch it for a long time I was very much adamant that it was going to suck and it was just another one of these hour-and-a-half-long video game type movies where it's just car chase and explosion but the acting was really good and not just Deadpool but the female weed who is now in Gotham she did an amazing job and she was a great actress and she did the<b>  sex</b> scenes and did them pretty well there was some hesitation in the final scenes and I think that's the biggest thing between a really good actress and an actress who isn't true to her craft when I see actresses like Nicole Kidman who does nudity because it's part of your crafts and does not try to hide the nudity that's really important in being a good actor or actress and so many actresses don't do the scenes and they don't do them well and it shows and it's it makes the movie not very good\n\nRight now I've been watching this series Here and Now and it's a good show it's on HBO but they have no nudity they keep saying that there's nudity but there's no nudity it's pixelated out or digitally mast and I think why even do the scenes when you're going to do this you've got all these women and they're not doing nudity they're faking doing nudity and it just Rex those scenes and I don't know why because Holly Hunter is not the type o<b> f woma</b>n who used to do this so I really don't understand why there's so few actresses that do nude scenes and do them well but when I see an actress who's not afraid of her sexuality and not afraid to be nude I have a great deal of respect for those women\n\nLucy Liu is another actress who is a great actress and she's a great actress not just because she's a good actor but also because she's not afraid to do nudity\n\nI recently purchased several photos that she did under an assumed name and there was nudity and she uses the money to fund one of her projects I think it's a charity and I thought how amazing is th<b> is wom</b>an that she does this it just made me respect her even more\n\nAnd women take compliments the wrong way you know when someone goes to a guy and says you know you've got really great muscles and you've got really great nipples you know but they call them packs or whatever and i<b> f a wo</b>man has really great breasts and really great nipples and so few women have great breasts in great nipples most of them have fake breasts and they don't look very good wh<b> en a w</b>oman gets a compliment like that I guess it depends on who's making the compliment but if a guy is sincere and he says you know that you have really great nipples she should know that you know that's somebody paying you a compliment saying that of all the women out there you're one of a handful of women who have nipples that are better than every <b> other </b>woman's that's a big deal that's a huge compliment\n\nIf someone said that to me if they said you know you have really great nipples I'd say thank you you know but women they think that it's degrading in some way and from some guys it is but from other guys it's not it's someone really appreciating you\n\nYes what I'm saying is you have to look at the source of the comment and if it's some jerk reporter and it's not a valid question or valid comment or derogatory comment then sure let him have it or her have it but if it's a sincere person that's giving you a compliment you know just say thank you you know and know that you have better nipples than 99.99% of women\n\nI personally like women with natural breast Allison Janney that's another really great actress when she did the scenes in Mast<b> ers </b>of Sex which she won an Emmy for and she should have won that Emmy because she was incredible when I saw her take off her nightgown and saw her breasts I was like she's beautiful she's incredible and she did it and she was awesome she did that role so well such a good actress\n\nHelen Hunt who didn't win the Oscar but should have for her role in the sessions she was awesome and she has an incredible body she really is gorgeous and she talked about you know that people said she was really courageous for doing the role and she was like yeah it'll and she dismissed it but seriously she was courageous and she did that role better than anybody could have I mean other than the women that I've discussed here I don't think that anybody could have done that roll any better she really should have won the Oscar\n\nShe's true to her craft and she should get more rolls because she is an incredible actress",

I also remember Ioan Gruffudd having to uncomfortably talk about the size of his dick while in his Fantastic 4 costume, yet no one bats an eye because he's a man. It's an incredibly stupid question, but not restrictive to women. Same goes for diet and exercise, which I've seen asked to Henry Cavill, Hugh Jackman, Chris Pratt, etc. Also, consider what articles you click before damming every interviewer as an idiot. If you chose a headline telling you how to get in Scarlet Johanson's shape ove<b> r Blac</b>k Widow's character development, remember you are also determining the type of questions she'll be asked in the future. These journalists have a job too, and as amazing as it might be to write about the complexities of a character, if their article gets no clicks, they'll be forced to ask shallow questions.",

YOU HAVE to define her as one of the greatest FEMALE players because she would be unable to beat the top men there fore she cannot be the best tennis player you can only call someone the best in their sport when there is no need for segregation in that sport. to say that she is the greatest tennis play would mean that she would have to be better than rodger federer or rod laver or margaret court or billie jean king. you can determine against billie jean king and margaret court because you can look at the progression in womens tennis and see how they have changed. even so it is still a difficult call between margaret court, Evonne Goolagong Cawley and serena williams. therefore their comment on her being the greatest womens player is the only claim they can try to make.\nOn  the kiera knightly response. THAT IS A COMMENT ASKED OF EVERYONE NOT JUST HER. Also she could have used this to empower people by saying how she balances work and life commitments but chose to come off as offended because how dare someone ask me a personal question.\nIn regards to ariana grande. That kind of question is always asked of guys as well. With girls its usually around phones and make up and with guys its usually cars their significant other or electronic devices. ITS THE SAME SET OF QUESTIONS AND IS NEVER TAKEN OFFENSIVELY BY MEN. IT IS MEANT TO BE A FUN QUESTION TO BE TAKEN LIGHTHEARTEDLY.\nand finally in regards to michael Parkinson. He is one of the most respected chat show hosts for a reason. he deliberately asked questions to make his quests slightly uncomfortable so that they will provide more powerful answers. and guys are asked the reverse about this all the time they are always asked about their tattoos or muscles stop acting like its a one way exchange of dialogue. also there are many times that women have \"sexually harassed\" men on tv with none of the same \"OUTRAGE\" just recently we had katy perry force a young guy to kiss her when he did not want to. men are expected to cave to women's demands on tv all the time yet if a man asks a <b> woman </b>for something he is a<b>  misogynist</b> #doubleStandards\nalso we dont need to hear about amy schumer making a comment about her vagina. that is disgusting comments and again if a guy made constant jokes about his penis then the media would slam him as a sexist comedian but IT'S FINE FOR AMY SCHUMER BECAUSE \"MY VAGINA\"",

First of all, third wave feminism has been so idiotic and <b> dumb,</b> a lot of women also go against this kind of feminism. If you actually look at what people are doing, you can clearly see how third wave feminism is just garbage. You have women trying to get rid of men, making women the 'powerful'<b>  gender</b> (I don't care abou<b> t gende</b>r a<b> nd s</b>ex), and trying to destroy all equalities and only help the women. Second of all, you need to be more mature and not appear as if you were a 2 y<b> ear </b>old. Saying these 'insults' just show how immature you are and how little evidence you actually have when trying to argue. All third wave feminists just use feelings and insults instead of pure evidence.",

Because the subset of men who are threatened by the outliers have created a stigma based on the outliers and do exactly what you see in these comments sections every time the f word comes up. Every movement has extremists, but the enhanced focus on the extremists in feminism are why feminism gets left only with the extremists and those who have the time and energy to put up with the bullshit of those who want to destroy the movement, which I'd say is harder for women as we aren't taken as seriously. I technically am a feminist, but I don't identify as such because I simply am not that masochistic, not that those who do are. You are in a unique position to help change that, but fuck it eh?",

The male shelter I sought protection from once, was run by a feminist political party. \n\nMeanwhile, the MALE SUPREMACY movement is gaining ground, MGTOW, Incels, MRA... All of them masking themselves as being about protecting men from oppression, but in reality they're all about hatred, seeking to oppress women once more, making up bullshit and radicalizing young men to their cause. Incels have already begun stacking bodies in their wake. \n\nBut yeah, \"third wave feminism\" is for sure a threat to all us males. It's not as if EVERY single wave of feminism had delicate manchildren becoming paranoid. Meanwhile, women have played the role of oppressors to men exactly hmmm let's see here...<b>  zero</b> times! Males are still overrepresented in just about every ruling position, yet somehow it's WOMEN that are a problem? Meanwhile you manchildren make fun of actually egalitarian societies despite them topping lists over happiness, quality of life, wealth and health? \n\nBull.Shit.

Also, the way certain feminists are treating men, you can kind of relate them to the early stages of nazism. When the war was just starting and Hitler recently gained power, the nazis weren't mainly about killing innocents yet. That was maybe around the mid 1940s. Instead, they were more about shaming and discouraging Jews. Now, if you replace <b> Nazi </b>with feminists and Jews with cis white males, you'd see a slight similarity. Feminists bash and harass the 'privileged white men' when they earn more money than them, just like the nazis with Jews.

It isn't sexist it is just letting the audience see your attire.

She does not compete against men on normal circumstance and (to my knowledge) hasn't since. \"Athlete\" is genderless (a person who is proficient in sports and other forms of physical exercise). So when comparing Athletes, we need to compare their proficiency to all other Athletes. If she can obtain those achievements compared to others regardless of <b> gender </b>then she would be considered \"One of the greatest\" of that word (Athlete). Since she does not compete against a certain form of those Athletes (males), that claim will have and asterisk (*), which would stand for \"female\". \n\nSo considering that, how is it sexist to ask what it's like to be one of the greatest female athletes?\nLooking for an actual answer here, I'm willing to retract my comment if a logical answer is found. (note: Since she only set those records while playing against the aforementioned \"*\", I consider them impressive, but not relevant to this question)",

Mainly, because women's personal space tends to be invaded more by the press, hence why they're asked how hard it is to have private lives. Also, for mothers, they naturally have more responsibilities (i.e. breastfeeding) that can leave them in a vulnerable position for the paparazzi. I agree with Kiera when she asked her follow up questions to that being asked of her but instantly when they said they would ask the males that question, it became an average, non-sexist, harmless query that is just standard for an interviewer.",

Now do another video but with the sexist questions and \"jokes\" women interviewers make towards men guests, more specifically hot male guests (happens every single time). A lot of them go beyond what some sexist male interviewers do and borderline sexually harass their hot male guests, but it's fine when it's towards men because they're men, according to the media. For example Ellen, I like her overall (mostly because she's a good comedian), but one of the double standards she just uses waaaaay too often on her shows is to ask the male guest to take the shirt off every time a hot male guest goes on her show, and all the women in the audience go <b> crazy </b>and support her sexist behavior. Now imagine if it was a male interviewer doing that to female guests... And Ellen is just the tip of the iceberg, she's an angel compared to some female interviewers out there who shamelessly do inappropriate things to their hot male guests (EVEN IF THEY'RE MARRIED) and the audience and media approves, 'cause double standards...",

Know why actresses like Laura Linney and Kathy Bates are taken more seriously? Because they have talent and don't rely on looks to get roles.

Now imagine if it was a male interviewer doing that to female guests... And Ellen is just the tip of the iceberg, she's an angel compared to some female interviewers out there who shamelessly do inappropriate things to their hot male guests (EVEN IF THEY'RE MARRIED) and the audience and media approves, 'cause double standards...",

                    "commentText": "That's actually wrong tho. A lot of interviewers do ask about exercises BUT to have a body like they have exercising isn't enough. Only 30% of it is exercising, the remaining 70% of it is very strict dieting. A lot of people go to the gym thinking that if they go to the gym they can eat whatever they want, but that's just plain ignorance. The most important thing they do to have those supermodel and Hollywood bodies is dieting. You can work out all you want but if you have bad eating habits then those types of bodies are impossible to achieve. When asked those questions about exercising most actors actually mention how important their diet is and how it's the worst part of their training, having to eat measured amounts of specific foods and not being able to eat what they really like to eat.\nAlso, exercising doesn't really make you lose weight, past a certain point you'll start gaining weight, cause muscle weights more than <b> fat.</b>\nAnd yes, unlike men, women don't really have to work out that much to be considered \"hot\", most of what they do is dieting, which is still terrible if you're a person who likes to eat.",

The point of the video isn't that men don't suffer from <b> sexism;</b> the point is that these women do. Period. Why bring outside sources that have absolutely<b>  nothing</b> to do with the video in? Yes, encouraging a male to take off his shirt and leaving a women alone would be sexist, though let's be real, there's more stigma around asking <b> a woma</b>n to undress than a male, which leads back to the fact that women's bodies are somehow considered more 'shameful' than males. Why? Because we have boobs? It's not our fault people can't keep it in their pants and bust a nut any time boobs are shown on screen. So, your comment doesn't really do anything but show your desperation to defend someone's ignorance when it comes to these situations. I do agree with you that men shouldn't be catcalled every time they take off their shirt, but women don't even get a chance to take off their shirts because it's somehow 'terrible' because oh no, Mother Nature exists and she gave women boobs. The entire point of the video was to show that these women refused to stand f<b> or sexi</b>sm. Period. Anything else is pretty irrelevant.",

You're looking at it from the perspective of what the questions say rather than who they're directed towards. The latter is where the problem comes in. Oftentimes, such as in the one with RDJ and Scar Jo, the men are given interesting questions concerning the development of their characters or the content of their music. With the women, however, the questions center more around what they're wearing, what their characters are wearing, how they look. That's not to say men don't get that as well, as I, personally, do not know. I just know women suffer from that. Let me ask you something. If you were, say, an athlete, and you dedicated your entire life to being an athlete, only to go in an interview for a huge game you won, wouldn't it frustrate you just a little bit if the only questions you got weren't even about the game? If they were about how your sports uniform fits, or who made it, instead of the plays you made and how hard you worked to train for this specific game, would it not annoy you at least a bit? Maybe not, but for a lot of people, it is annoying, these women in particular. That is why those questions have been labeled sexist; the exact wording of them had little to <b> nothing </b>to do with it. I'm not sure if you understand me, and if needed, I can try to put it in another way, but I ask you to try and see it from their perspective instead of your own.",

Same for women. Most people aren't attracted to women who don't have bodies that match today's beauty standards, and the same goes for men. I don't know if you've noticed, but my reply was addressing the point previous commenters brought up, which was that men are faced with<b>  sexism</b> too including being encouraged to take their shirts off, and that is why I brought up the fact that women's bodies are consider shameful. I can't quite explain it as well as I would like to in a simple YouTube comment, but I don't get why women are punished for having attractive bodies when there are plenty of men who also have attractive bodies. I'll be the first to agree with you because I find women's bodies beyond attractive, but some people find men's bodies attractive. So, what's different? The fact that most cultures are formed from a male dominant society is what. I'm not usually one for what I calle<b> d feminaz</b>i propaganda, but women are forced to cover up because men can't handle being around an attracti<b> ve wom</b>an. Period. This is unfair to both men and women in my opinion because, once more referencing a previous comment, men are encouraged to take their shirts off and leered at by women (and other men, but for the sake of simplicity I'm speaking about a heterosexual audience) as if it's okay when it's not. Women feel uncomfortable when men leer at them, so men have a right to feel uncomfortable when women leer at them. Now, I can't say for sure that they are because I'm not a male, but a lot of these people love to talk about equality, and well, it's not really equal. So it's a double edged sword, but the excuse of women having attractive bodies isn't really a valid one.",

The \"who are you wearing\" Question itself isn't what's sexist, it's the unequal use of it! This question is more often asked to women than men! Sure they ask men sometimes and sure maybe someone does genuinely want to know, but the focus on women's outward appearances outweighs the focus on their intellect in comparison to men. This relates with the dieting questions as well. Again, sometimes they ask men what their workout routine is, but not very often do they ask them if they have any \"dieting\" tips they'd like to share like they did with Rowan.",

The reason women are treated so differently sometimes is because physically, men are built stronger (I'm not saying women can't be stronger than men) and a while back then being strong mattered, and it still does today, but not nearly as much, which is why women used to be in the kitchen and teaching, men were doing things that required strength (once again, not saying that women can't be strong but I'm going off of averages). Now that more jobs are related to intelligence than strength, women are equal in qualification. (Btw the wage gap is kind of bs and that's a fact, actually research it if you think it exists) But sadly many women are complaining about something that had <b> nothing </b>to do with them or pretty much any of the men they might know, sure maybe they are being treated unfairly by some dickhead they met on the street, but if that hurts your feelings enough to waste someone's time and complain, you need to check your priorities and realize that you shouldn't give a fuck about someone else's feelings. In short, learn to take a rude comment, just like EVERYONE does, not just women.\n\nAlso almost none of these questions were sexist, for example \"what's your diet?,\" in what fucking way is that sexist, if I walked up to a women right now and I asked what's your diet, does that make me a sexist? Fuck no, also \"what's your favorite position,\" that's not sexist, if anything it's slightly perverted but not sexist, I guess it's time for me to realize that this won't change anyone's mind and people calling themselves feminists (bad name btw) should just learn to be ok with their own life, and not 'Fix' others.",

I've seen many of them question multiple times about their physique and the routines they did to maintain or put on games for the bodies they have. So you can throw that fucking question about physique out the fucking window. For women if the right person is asking the question they don't care what the question is.",

It's a shallow question that could be thrown at for example Tom Hardy, but most dudes are taken too seriously to even get that kind of questions. If he says \"can we talk about my role instead? The reporter would likely say \"oh yeah of course, I guess there are moee important things to focus on\". If it's a girl saying \"hey let's not focus on that right now\", they will often try again and again to get their question answered because some feel like they can't take a no as an answer from a <b> woman.</b> It's also the notion that women always should be super focused on dieting and teaching her lady followers how to live a fit and glam life. Some are totally not interested in that and besides, I don't think that many are that interested in reading about it in for example a movie magazine.",

If you insist on asking even when she's not interested in telling you, that's being an asshole. If you insist on asking her but you would accept a \"Oi, dude, please stop this line of questioning already\" from a man, then it's sexist.\n\nIf you ask a girl friend about her make up or cell phone, it's not sexist. If you insist that that's the only interests she could possibly have because she's a <b> woman?</b> Yeah. Wonder of wonder, that's sexist.\n\nI mean, it's not rocket science, this?",

The hard work and confrontation are left to women because many men (and some women) decide on that \"this is silly\", so this solo pushing is one of many things that makes women seem \"desperate\" in men's eyes.",

            "commentText": "Come on, I know some of the questions were too far out, but the celebs themselves must also realize, that they themselves play alot into the culture of hypersexualization. Ariana Grande fx. have to expect, getting <b> sexual </b>questions, when she pertrays herself in a hypersexual way, in both media and Music videos. The same with Scarlet Johanson. If they want a less sexualized culture, they could also change how they pertray themselves, and fx. say no to roles, where they clearly help the hypersexualized culture. If you want to be seen, for who you are as a person, and not how you look, where more baggy clothes. It's the same for men, but it's just a bigger problem for women, due to mens more visually stimulated<b>  sexual</b> behavior. If you don't want to awaken the animal in a man, tone down your apperence a bit. \nI also know that men definately have a part in all of this, probably the biggest, but just remember, that you as a women, also have a responsibility, and can help make it all a bit easier, bc in the end we are all just animals.\nRegarding the Anne Hathaway case, I think it's a bit more serious, and she definately has a valid point. But she has also herself, chosen to be a part of the public perception, as an actor. Without the public focus, that makes people care about her wardrobe malfunction, they wouldn't Care about her new movie, and therefore she would be jobless. If she cares enough about what she said, she should start maling small indie movies, outside of the general public's sphere. If she did that, there would still be a small group of people that would care, but it would be a lot less, and it would also be a lot more accepting, and non-judgemental, due to the kind of people, who watch those movies. Probably like minded people to herself.\nAnyway my point is just, look at what you're playing into yourself, and if you want to change the system, start by changing, what you yourself perticipate in. Then the system will also change.",

I'll give you one, maybe two, being mildly sexist (particularly the last one) but if you watched the whole interviews for the rest, no they're not sexist at all. Guys receive identical questions all the time; is it sexist against them? Can something be sexist against both genders for the exact same reasons at the same time? In my mind, something that affects both genders equally doesn't sound like <b> sexism </b>anymore, ya know?",

As interviewers, they should also possess the skills to notice the mood and personality of their guest, and gage what is acceptable to talk about and what isn't. \n\nTo be fair though, there are also male celebrities that have had to answer these kind of infantile questions as well, and they seem equally unimpressed.  Entertainment media can be real scuzzy at times and we can all take a stand by not supporting it and giving attention to these kinds of stories and interviews.   Too many people can't resist there own curiosity when it comes to these kinds of stupid questions and it degrades us all.",

And she said she would never want to seriously play against men I'm a league. Because men are naturally more athletic. It's not sexist it's biology. Get over it. Fuck I'm only 50 seconds into the video. It's now sexist to say how to you balance a personal and career life? Really? Because I'm in college and have a job. And like the first fuckomg question people ask teachers is how to balance work school and social life.  Generally girls ask these questions because they tend to care more about finding a good balance and the guys just say fuck  it and scrape by with Cs. So maybe all these girls asking their professors for advice would also love to hear advice from successful women. Somehow that's sexist lol Jesus fuck. OK well the radio position question yeah that's a troll being sexist. Also the Scarlett ones. The underwear ones just stupid. Who cares. <b> Dumb </b>question. Not sexist. But the fitness regime. Maybe it's because young girls really fucking are insecure about their figure and young girls want to loom like her. Same thing with the girl next door one. Girls look up to these people.  Hathaway. Yeah that's fucked up. Don't spread inappropriate pictures. Just wrong. But again the work out questions. Young girls are insecure about their figure. So they want to know this question. Girls have a difficult time giving up  their phones and make up. That's just true. And guys have trouble giving up porn and sports. So what. The last one is fucked up. Also like ages ago. Times have changed. Also feminist isn't a dirty word anymore? Feminist use to be a positive thing. Now its a fucking dirty word. More than half of these were legit questions. The rest were just<b>  dumb</b> questions not sexist. And there was a few actual sexist ones that I pointed out.",

Unless he was making a workout tape, I'm gonna guess your answer is no. It's not that the question itself was inappropriate, it's the fact that it seems like only women are asked these types of questions. And asking a, at the time probably 16 year <b> old,</b> girl a question about her dieting tips was inappropriate in that moment. Not everyone goes on diets. And asking a girl what her tips on dieting are for OTHER GIRLS is just like implying that other girls are looking for that. As if they're just sitting around wondering and hoping that they can find dieting tips from they're favorite celebrities. Maybe that is the case, but for most people it probably is not. \n\nAbout the objectification of female actresses- It's not the women that are choosing to be objectified. It's society doing that. You see men walking around in movies shirtless in some scenes and no one bats an eye or objectifies them in any way. It's not anyone's fault but your own if you're seeing someone (man or<b>  woman</b>) as an object just because they may be showing some skin. And the fact that you see no problem with that kinda scares me. \n\n\"If Channing Tatum was asked about his figure, I'd imagine it'd be a similar matter.\" \n1) When has any interviewer asked him about his 'figure'?\n2) In what way would it be a similar matter??\n3) You are honestly just as sexist as the interviewers in this video even if you don't mean to be",

I've seen entire articles (based off interviews) about how practically any male in a movie for got physically  ready for the role. Chris Hemsworth? Yep. Chris Evans? Yep. Hugh Jackson? Uh huh. Chris Pratt? Yes again. \n\nAnd oh, since you mentioned him let's talk about Channing Tatum for a second. First, yes I've seen him answer questions about how he works out and keeps himself in shape. And since you also seem to believe that male actors are never objectified then how the hell did he star in two movies about freaking male strippers? Two whole movies where the entire point was for the (almost entirely female) audience to stare at good-looking men dancing without much shirts! And guess what, women were definitely batted their eyes. But I guess that can't be objectifying  because they're men.\n\nNow let's move on to another half-formed thought you had. There is <b> nothing </b>wrong with asking a<b>  woman</b> about diet tips for other women. Do you know who usually asks those question? Women's magazines, for women to read about. And they do it for the the same reason they ask men about their workouts; because people realize that they are good looking and want to be like them! \n\nAnd you may not have mentioned it but it's been bugging me since I saw it in the video. When women are asked about the clothes they wear it's not because of men. Men don't really care who made any of the clothes and it's not men that sit around on tv and criticize everyone's choices. Men usually aren't asked about their tuxes/suits either because they all look the same for the most part.",

This is not assuming that she has no talent because in the world of women she is the most talented but when compared to her male counterparts in the sport she would easily be beat. Men also play 5 sets to win while women play 3 sets to win so using that as a platform alone you can make the assumption that the male tennis player would almost automatically be build to win the final 2 sets while women would not, but even then, in a 3 set game for a male tennis player against Serena I would put my house on the male to beat Serena around the court and barely break a sweat",

Sounded mostly like she had a possee of her crew that she trusts and then becomes overly controlling. Its probably control issues and stress and not realizing how she may come across in those moments. \n\nI don't know personally, not done anything with her. The only person that stood out to me to make things not fun on projects was Wil Smith although mainly because of everyones uptight need to get stuff perfect for him, kind of way. I have worked on 2 films (maybe 3) with him and the only exchange we had was him saying \"scuse me\" (with a tone of \"you are in my way\") LOL \n\nI find that alot of the ones people trash as rude on here were because it was a bad moment or they said something offensive (which people dont realize that the celebrity doesn't know them back). I worked on something with Mike Tyson and was floored that a guy thought it would be funny to joke about his prison thing for rape as the first thing to say to him.",

However, you can't blame these women for playing by the industry rules, rather talented or not. That is how they make their living. It is the industry that needs to change and focus more on talent, but that is not going to happen anytime soon. Also, these women should be spoken to with respect despite what they are wearing. These type of of sexist question perpetuates the steryotype that in order to be famous, one has to be attractive.  Additionally, even if these women were to dress conservatively, it will not stop the sexist questions from being asked. An interviewer will still ask what underwear a <b> woman </b>is wearing under her burka if he feel it will be appealing to the audience. Additionally, it could ruin her chances of getting noticed among the more revealing actresses, hindering her from getting a future gig. It does not matter if that female celebrity is talented or not. \n\nFurthermore, I personally feel Anne Hathaway is very talented. She is able to play multiple types of roles. It's simply your opinion to think that these women are simply beautiful faces with no talent. However, they still deserve respect for being able to find success in a superficial industry.",

But as you seem to understand neither politics nor the correct definitions of the terminology you use, perhaps this is above your understanding.",

It's obvious when it comes down to statistics, the amount of girls who wear makeup is much greater so than guys. Also, more guys play video games and enjoy cars than girls. It's not 'sexist', it's just facts. It's not even a bad thing if a guy wants to apply makeup or a girl playing games and enjoying cars. That's just being unnecessarily sensitive.

That is how you lose contracts. \n\nIn terms of WHY it is offensive, since a lot of men in this section seem to not get it, and keep stating \"it's not rude\"...If you have an intensely successful person in front of you who is a) female and b) a <b> woman </b>of color you can ask things like \"what brought you to success\" or any real interview question. \n\nInstead, what they did was ask her a bunch of basic stuff that puts people on the spot. That might be ok for a white dude in the industry who doesn't have to face a bunch of people trying to unhinge or unseat them all the time but it is NOT OK to do that to someone who faces it often if you want to keep a good reputation as a radio company. \n\nWithin that offense they implied that she only cares about her phone or her makeup, as if she is a 2D person if she cares about those things. Newsflash that phones keep women safe and makeup keeps you financed. Understanding makeup also keeps her in charge of her own image, which is a big thing for women in entertainment. \n\nSo they cut down two things that are very important to female entertainers for income and personal safety, they failed to ask any real questions or make her feel comfortable (the literal job of a host, because it gets the person to talk candidly), they offended a star who is known for keeping her cool, and they failed to pick up on her being very uncomfortable, or knew it but continued anyway.

I mean, if it were me I'd honestly answer and say 'both' or 'neither' or say makeup because I can't live without my phone ((assuming I get to keep one if I choose the other)). And the phone thing, everyone's addicted. So it's not too far fetched to think that she'd have a hard time choosing her phone or something else. And the make up part, female celebrities wear make up a LOT. Ariana Grande's no different. She's more down to earth and uses it to highlight her natural beauty, but she still uses it. So.....it's actually a very valid question. \n\nI don't know, maybe it's just me? I'm not a fan of conflict, so I try to avoid them as much as possible, especially in public. Unless there's something that really bothers me, I'm more of a 'go-with-the-flow' kind of gal. I'm not going to spark unnecessary arguments just because I felt it was rude.",

Mad Max is a franchise where Max is the main character and they took that franchise and changed it completely and made a <b> woman </b>who isn't Max the main character, it's hacky\n8. Not sexist, that question is asked of male celebrities all the time, you people are on drugs.\n7. Again not sexist, she changes her hair colour regularly. So why can't someone ask about it? if Garfield changed his hair colour all the time they'd ask him about it. This is a great example of how feminists do their best to find<b>  sexism</b> in everything even when there is none.\n6. Again not sexist how exactly is asking someones favourite position a suggestion that women are inferior to men? like you do know that is wha<b> t sexis</b>m is, it's n<b> ot sexu</b>al questions, or admiring looks, or calling a female a female, it's the belief that <b> one gen</b>der is inferior to the other... was a funny answer though.\n5. Again not sexist, sleazy sure but not sexist. Also she didn't really shut anything down she just complained about it.\n4. Ag<b> ain, se</b>xism is the belief tha<b> t on</b>e sex is inferior to another. Men and women are different, that's a fact so asking different questions is not a suggestion of supremacy, but just tailoring to the demographics. ffs\n3. How is asking what lesson have you learned from an experience sexist? what the actual fuck. He's simply asking her a pretty standard question about how she feels about the situation. In what world is that sexist.\n2. Again not sexist at all, she obviously uses makeup and a phone. This is a pretty standard kinda question the people ask each other especially guys. If you had to give up beer or porn which would it be. It is not sexist to pick something to the persons tastes or what you think their tastes are.\n1. Well finally you've found an example of <b> actual </b>sexism, it only took you 10 tries. Well done.",

Seriously people, these sort of videos do the fight against<b>  sexism</b> and real feminism a massive disservice.

Do you think anyone went to Brad Pitts movies because of his acting??? They went because he's a cool, good looking guy and he always gets the girl who also happens to be good looking and sexy...that's just the way the movies work people. Go ahead and stop putting these people in the movies. Use only ugly actresses and actors....see what happens to the industry...women just don't get that...men go to see the hot looking <b> woman </b>in the movie (because it's natural) and to be entertained for two hours....women over think things and want to be emotionally involved in the movie which is fine...but if you look at the likes versus the dislikes on this video you will see that more than 25% of people disagree with you. That's a lot of dislikes so you missed the mark a bit. Face it, people get in the movies because they are attractive or have some kind of<b>  sex</b> appeal. Live with it and after you get rich and famous because you are sexy and attractive don't try and say \"hey, don't look at or talk about my attractiveness\" If you didn't want that, you should not have signed on for the job. That is what the job is, that very thing. If you don't like it, go be a stenographer or an accountant or a CEO, or whatever but don't go in to the entertainment business just because you have the parts and then get pissed off if people talk about you in <b> a sexua</b>l way.",

In short, what are you talking about?)\n \nThere was one highly publicized attempt to start a boycott of \"Mad Max: Fury Road,\" and it was led by a blogger named Aaron Carey. He likes movies with explosions, never saw \"Fury Road,\" finds women scary, and is obsessed with things being rammed down his throat. You and he seem a lot alike. His \"reason\" for a boycott was 'If you were like me, the explosions, fire tornadoes, even the symphonic score surrounding 'Fury Road's' first trailer made your attendance a foregone conclusion. It looked like a straight-up guy flick. The truth is I'm angry about the extents Hollywood and the director of Fury Road went to trick me and other men into seeing this movie. ...

Williams can be seen with his/her sibling in videos below. One is from TRANS Sport apt name eh, and the other, is a run down on why she can't be a female. Williams is a liar a fraud, and her being a male, right down to her DNA, gave her an unfair advantage in tennis, and basically ROBBED every other player out of a win because she once had a cock & balls.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p31aGy_jD3E&t=163s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs0jnFobpXM",

Disregarding any personality, male superheroes generally have emphasised muscles and jawlines and female superheroes tend to have curves. Both of those are considered attractive and both sides are represented in modern films, but the frequency that female actors are asked questions about fitness and dieting and fashion and stuff relating to <b> sex </b>is a lot more than how often male actors get asked, even though attractiveness plays a big part",

They ask the males questions they think will appeal to men, and the females questions that will appeal to women.\n\nI know I know, sexist of me to say hair, clothes, and diets appeal to<b>  woman</b> right?  Go tell that to Oprah and Dr Oz and well every store everywhere who markets, knowing just what women buy.\n\nIt's marketing.  Is it fucked up? Kindof, yeah, but it's based off of the interests that are overwhelmingly proven constantly day in and day out.\n\nAsking the singer what she would be without, makeup or her phone is sexist right?  Well open her backpack, because she did not bring a purse right? And I bet she had no makeup in there?  But would not put money on it because, not a fan of throwing that away. She can say it's sexist all she wants but pretty much 100% that she was the only one in that room carrying makeup on her so..  The marketing was not wrong.\n\nThe little girl asked about dieting? First, girls and women pay more attention to dieting than boys, go look at any magazine that advertises to girls or women, ever.  \nWould you ask that of a boy?\nYes. In fact we would.  If we were talking to some boy who might possibly have some sort of a diet, say a gymnast, weight lifter or runner, we sure would ask him.  And he would be happy to tell us, rather than get bitchy and professionally offended about it.",

However, the interviewers regardless of their <b> gender </b>( I don't care If you're a unicorn ) focused only on the first part over and over and over and were pushing it to the point of making the actresses feel awkward and uncomfortable. Sure male actors get asked these type of questions but these questions are not dominant in most of their interviews.\n\n\nWith that being said, I agree with you 100% on the sexualization of male actors. People tend to only focus on female characters being sexualized in movies and are quick to defend them which is a double standard against men T.T     I mean, have you seen how men get ridiculously sexualized in Ellen's show?!! I cringe every time I see that.\n\n\nSorry for my long rant, my English is not very good but I hope my post is clear to you. Peace <3",

No, of course they don't do that to the guys. The whole point of the <b> red<b>  </b</b>>carpet is the fashion and you know what men'<b> s r<b> e</b</b>>d carpet fashion is? Suits in grey, blue,<b>  or bl</b>ack, either with a tie or a bowtie. That's it. There's no pretty details or trains, or lacework, or appliqu\u00e9 or sparklies or design intricacies on suits that everyone's interested in seeing. And even if there was, it's unlikely to be all over the suit like it is on gowns. No one is gonna wear a 70,000 dollar gown on the redcarpet if they don't get to show off how beautiful it is, and designers would stop providing gowns if celebs weren't going to show off all that painstaking work.\n\nAnd finally, I've seen PLENTY of interviews with male celebrities where they're asked questions about work/life balance and if they're single, what they're looking for in a partner.",

Once, I heard a fully grown man, with grandchildren and a daughter say 'women have <b> nothing </b>useful to say', or 'women have<b>  nothing</b> useful in their head'. Ha! U thought he was joking, and asked him if he was. He wasn't. \nHE WASN'T. He must be an idiot with low self-esteem or something, because he actually lives with two women, and uggghhh. I thought after that, of saying, women actually have a chemical in their body that makes them have logical thoughts when they're about 19, but men only get it when they're about '23'. I'm not exactly sure. But tha<b> t sexis</b>m...   Is just idiotic and FRUSTRATING. He seems like someone you CAN NOT reason with. But come on man, we have brains, we are going to think of so etching sooner or later and woop yo ass, so now, or up in heaven, you're mind will be blown. If feminism gets back on its feet and stops trying to do exactly what men have done to us (which makes me feel sick), then society will be better for it. It really will, NO question about it.

With Rowan Blanchard, it even shows how young girls are ridiculed with sexist comments and conformity. Like, usually men are praised for acting (slightly) arrogant or like a douche, and they hardly have to worry about anything other than their hair and maybe beard, a colonel and deoderant. WOMEN are expected to have perfection, or she will be criticized. We ARE criticized with a fine tooth comb. All the time. And men, when their good features are praised, they get all gushy and show off, or deflect it. There are a bit of double standards there, but men love being objectified because it is the opposite of threatening, it's boosting their ego and masculinity. But for women, it's taking our control, our power away. Because a man does a shirtless scene in his underwear (the vacation), and he's noticed for it, asked about it, all of the above, and he takes it in his stride. But a <b> woman </b>is asked IF SHE WAS WEARING ANY UNDERWEAR in a strong, powerful female lead with great acting, wear she was wearing a full suit of clothing. You wanna shout us down? Look somewhere else. Maybe think with your head, and not with your dick.",

The worse insult said whether in the playground or in a business meeting is \"you're being a girl\". That's awful. You usually wave it off, but just sit down and think about how awful that is. You raise girls on \"feminine\" toys, frilly clothes, and movies that imply that the only way you'll be loved or worth anything if you're a girl is it you're beautiful or sexy. (All the female actors HAVE to be gorgeous for some reason while the guys can be a range of different levels of attractiveness and still be in romantic movies and movies in general.) If the protagonist is male, the movie/show/book is for everyone. If the protagonist is female, then we treat it as if it's only for women/girls. What's wrong with relating to a woman/girl? We really are more alike then different. We are raised so differently that yes some girls will act extremely feminine (whatever counts as fem or masc in that culture) and some boys will act as if we're compensating for insecurity",

Honestly, I don't think 'Ms Mojo' should exist in the first place - it's sexist of a channel to presume that a <b> woman </b>would want to watch something different to that of a man (and vice versa). I had the same problem with the 'women's only screenings' of wonder<b> -woman</b>. You don't see all male screenings of Iron Man, for instance, because it's 'acceptable' for women and men to enjoy feature films that praise male strength. Whereas, films like wonde<b> r-woma</b>n (which attempt to showcase female strength) are marketed instead as 'chick-flicks'.  I find that quite upsetting. (But just my opinion).",

                    "commentText": "No, the problem is that working on skill will only take you so far, at all levels of the game, you will find barriers to improvement due to fitness and physical strength. At the top end of tennis, it takes a huge amount of physical strength to hit a ball over the net at 110mph with enough top spin to keep it in the court. Even if you have trained enough to hit the lines every time, you aren't going to be able to maintain that when someone is belting it back at you at such pace, without comparable strength. This is why serving is so important, it is very difficult to return a 140mph serve with any kind of precision and control, most tennis players primary concern when facing serves of that speed is simply to get it back in the court. I played competitively as a teenager and had a 115mph first serve, and less than half the time would it make it back over the net, simply because the physical strength necessary to return such a serve just isn't there in most teenage tennis players, and this is something that remains true right the way throughout the game, it has served players like Karlovic, Isner and Roddick well.",

Then they make this remake of Mad Max and I barely wanted to go. When I saw Furiosa, I had my new female action hero. I ended up seeing this movie 3 times in cinema and bought the DVD as soon as it released. I love how she fights against a man, with only one arm and the fight is still fair. Also the fight scene looks realistic. That was what I was searching for! I always mess with boys when I was a girl and I still in sports today.",

A lot of the other women did indeed seem disrespected. As for the honorable mentions, Swift seems to use men for her music, that's why she's constantly asked about it. Amy Schumer just likes to say things she thinks sound feminist or intelligent, instead she just overshares and the journalists try to laugh it off. Men have been asked sexist questions, just not as frequently. Now, because a lot(not all mind you) of females get their role because they're \"the sexiest\" or sell more music by being better looking than the competition, well, actual talent seems to fall to the wayside too often.",

The natural physical strength of the body is a contributing factor, however, in sports an athlete needs more than physical strength (i.e. agility, endurance, perseverance, technique). I believe the reason Serena makes a point of being recognized as 'sportsperson of the year' is because of all the titles she has won during her career. As the video says \"as the only tennis player, male or female, to win 2 of 4 Grand Slams 7 times each and the only one to win 10 Grand Slam singles in 2 different decades\". As an athlete, that is an impressive accomplishment.",

She's wearing a shit ton of make up, And I don't know anyone younger than 30 who doesn't love their smart phone. It's like if you asked a dude with in a jersey and a belly to choose between sports and beer. If you're going to flaunt your femininity you don't get to be offended by a harmless theoretical question that are based on things anyone can see. People use feminism as an excuse to get offended over <b> nothing,</b> if it's really about equality I want to start seeing males get butt hurt anytime anyone refers to their masculinity or any aspect of it. People would quickly realize the futility of it all.",

However most actresses always get that question asked even if they didnt change their appearance. Even then, it wouldnt be so bad if those werent the only questions being asked. If Scarlett got asked questions about character development (as RDJ) about the future of the character (as chris pratt) about the difficulties of mentally transforming into that character (as Tom Holand and Dr Strange got asked) maybe this fitness questions would be so sexist. But she is always asked: fitness, body, diet and fashion. Even in the endgame interviews where eveyone was going deep on how leaving or ending this chapter of their lives she was asked about fashion! like that is the only thing females do?

I'm sorry because I can't remember the exact numbers but there was a poll asking people if they believed in <b> gender </b>equality. As expected the answers were almost 100% yes. They then asked the same people if they were feminists. The number of people who said yes dropped drastically. This shows that because of the actions of many 'feminists' a large portion of people no longer view feminism as a fight for equality. \nAnd I also don't think that women 'repopulate the earth' on their own lol.

The problem is too many women choose not to see how hypocritical they are . Number 1 was brilliant. The most powerful group is beautiful women, why? because if they dont want to work hard they dont have too. Someone will take care of them, you can lie to yourself if you want but i suggest you give some kind of accountability to those women aka gold diggers/sluts that drag women back before you point fingers elsewhere.

Women don't have the genes to grow the amount of muscle an average man has. Just think of all the top female athletes being born with the physique of an average man, then pitting the 2 genders against each other would be valid, because both would have the equal ability to develop more strength through the same amount of training. But that's not the case. Both female and male athletes put in the same amount of effort in their training and have achieved magnificent results from their respective categories. It's fair play, so please do accept female athletes as equally great as male athletes, otherwise lol i give up on trying to explain further.",

Venus then walked on court and again Braasch was victorious, this time winning 6\u20132.[54] Braasch said afterwards, \"500 and above, no chance\". He added that he had played like someone ranked 600th in order to keep the game \"fun\".[55] Braasch said the big difference was that men can chase down shots much easier, and that men put spin on the ball that the women can't handle. The Williams sisters adjusted their claim to beating men outside the top 350.\" -Wiki. This is funny as fuck.",

There is no possible way to achive <b> gender </b>equality and thinking so is plainly retarded. In terms of work related equality its also  completely situation based and case to case sensitive. One cant just say \"work\" and say equality. Why? let me picture 2 scenarios-\n1: We have a workplace in a coalmine or an Oilrig wich is heavily maledominant because we have better stamina by a pure biologic fact.\n2 We got hospitals and nursing wokrareas wich are a caring and emotional workspace wich are heavily femaledominated.\n\nThe reason it looks like this is because by nature women are generally better at work related to caring for other people by a biological design.\nIt is like this because of the fact that the ability to give birth comes with the pure instinct to protect. \nAnd the same goes for Men in heavily male dominated workareas, we were the hunters and as such we had to endure long periods of stress and fear, wich triggers adrenaline wich also boosts your stamina and endurance wich makes men far better at work that are heavily physical in nature.\nSo when people ask for equality its just not ever gonna happen on the scale feminists today crave. \nIf a man and women work at the same place wiht the same choirs and responsibilities then yes ofc the salary should most definetly be exactly the same regardles of<b>  gender</b>.",

These questions show a very distinct difference of how men are given merit based on their intellect and creativity, whereas women are mostly questioned about their image. It is much easier to capitalise on a \"sexy\" <b> woman </b>than an \"intelligent\"<b>  woman</b>. If people don't see an issue with this then you are sexist. If you want to be with <b> a woma</b>n but want her to be like \"one of the boys and not care about the way people validate her in the world\", you are sexist. Feminism is not about women being modest, it's about recognising the multiplicity of men and women. People who loosely use terms lik<b> e \"femina</b>zi\" are equally as ill-informed as the people who falsely portray what feminism is.

            "commentText": "My absolute favorite is Scarlet Johanson and Anne Hathaway. Such strong women. I feel that they really just took the bull by the horns. It is absolutely innapropriate to ask about someone's undergarments, I could see this happening to a male actor as well and I just think the entire question should be off limits. Anne Hathaway did a great job in handling the question, what a lot of people don't seem do,tunderstand about these actors and actresses is that they loose or gain weight to fit the specific role, not to change themselves in everyday life. It was not an important question and she answered the way she felt was necessary which lead to him pushing, I think it was a witty and cunning way to play the question. Now can we talk about how apparently anything a women does in the media today that is remotely strong is a \"feminist act\" women do not need to go out of their way to prove they are strong, a truely strong proud and confident women lives her life the way she wants and is comfortable with that. I doubt that when these women such those mindless questions down they had the media and being a feminist in mind, obviously they want to be good role models but not everything that a women does has to be or directed at being a feminist. I am a feminist in the since that I am proud to be a women and recognize there is a certain beauty and je na sais quoi in being a women but I do not feel the overwhelming need to go out and protest my feminism and my strength. I do not feel the need to make it a big deal that men in my house do the yard work, I don't do yard work. I sincerely doubt that there is a part of me that thinks that it is a mans job, it is simply because I have allergies and I prefer to cook, I love to cook. I do find it sexist and disrespectful that people sometimes assume what women can and can't do or want to do but just like everyone else women have preferences, i know women who do the yard work and enjoy it, I simply don't. (I was using the yard work as an example due to hearing presumptions all the time) this video is enjoyable but the title is all wrong. It should simply state that actresses what more meaningful questions because there's sometimes they get asked some pretty boring questions",

We were doing a group interview with the town Mayor and asked what's the best way to get hired (no <b> gender </b>indicated). First words out of his mouth were \"Ugly women don't get jobs.\" And \"Girls are seen as lazy if they do not wear make up. It's just a fact of life.\" I don't know if he would so openly state that again today but it was recent enough that it could still apply. Shocked even the guys... the interview got really awkward after that and no one applied for his internship; though, to be fair, that may have been because the job was (literally) moving paperwork. Not exactly worthwhile skill building.",

Because they don't. Men estrange themselves from family working too hard. Men are trying to learn this skill from the experts. People asking for advice is a complement, not an insult. Sheesh.\n\nI mean some of these are jokes. People are laughing. Especially the  bit with the podcast asking about girly things. They were messing with her. She was savvy to mess back.

Diet is part of lifestyle a healthy diet = a healthy lifestyle. You are adding all sorts of assumptions here that aren't actually true. You're assuming it's an adult posing the question to pressure her about her weight, when in reality it is most likely a young girl asking the question to get advice from someone they admire. You assume diet is a bad thing, whi<b> ch is </b>weird. What is bad about being healthy exactly? Sure some diets are horrible, but for the most part a specific diet is a good thing. There's a laundry list of health issues that stem from poor diet.\n\nNone of these are sexist except the last one. Th<b> e only </b>sexism is the list itself and these comments.

We often get girl magazines right? where expectations of our body image are placed over expectations on emotional/health/intelligence. So this girl, which show teaches to be who you are and love yourself gets asked a question about dieting as if she was a professional in nutrition? That is why we have so may problems with girls and diets, cause is seems normal for a girl that <b> age </b>to be in a slim-diet when it shouldnt. That is why we got the kardashians everywhere trying to sell magic lollypops and teas and girls going towards bulimia and anorexia. \n\n\nNo other 13 year<b>  old</b> disney actor has been asked this question, but it seems ok to ask a girl cause as a previous comment stated, girls are expected to be always \"product ready\" in a society where women are seen as products rather than as humans it is easy to deny thes<b> e sexis</b>m, but it exists. \n\n\nIf you, as a 14 ye<b> ar o</b>ld dude go to a 14 y<b> ear </b>old dude in a conversation as friends or people that know each other at leat, is completely different to being an adult and asking a 13 <b> year</b> old for her diet when you could have a million other more interesting questions on an event like that. What this question did was just bringing an empowered human back into a \"product ready girl\". That is why we had Millie Bobby Brown (also 13) called the \"one of the sexiest tv stars\" cause we are normalizing girls-diet-image slim-girls. So yeah, it is sexist cause no other 13<b>  yea</b>r old disney actor has been asked the same question, it limits her potential only towards her body",

In my class the first thing a girl does when she sits is check her makeup and check her phone, same thing when she goes to the restroom, cafeteria, playground, sits in a car...\n\nAs for the Scarlett Johannson and Anna Hatheway, the questions were very rude.

Seriously though, if you want to consider a question about hair sexist then having ms mojo as a separate channel is sexist, if you think about it they divide their videos based on what they think women like. Men and women are different, they like different things and they get asked different questions, that is not<b>  sexism</b>. However, how can you consider a question about hair sexist and ignore that some journalists(mostly women) make articles about some actor's genitals? I have seen articles about bulges, i have seen an article talking about eminem's erection problems. just look at these titles:\n\"DANIEL CRAIG ADMITS HE HAD TO USE STUNT DOUBLES PACKING STUNT PENISES FOR HI<b> S SE</b>X SCENES IN NEW JAMES BOND MOVIE\"\n\"Daniel Radcliffe: My willy shrank on stage\"\n\"Shia LaBeouf Admits His Shortcomings\"\ni guess it's only sexist when men do it",

Secondly for a very long time, (and sadly in cinema even today) women were given minor roles where it was demanded of them to flaunt their sexuality for the gratification of a male audience which had next to no interest in an actress with a serious meaningful role which still happens today.\nAnd if you could see, even for an action movie Anna was asked about her figure which was in no way related to the movie's content, at all. \nWomen, even when flaunting their bodies would loved to be asked about other topics because their appearance isn't the sum of their worth as people or artists. It wouldn't be very absurd to ask about their figure at let's say, a fashion show. But that's not the case, from action movies to radio interviews all women are asked is about their appearance and other overly feminised topics which is irrelevant. No one really goes, \"What brand is your favourite cologne?\" while a male superstar is promoting an action movie. \nThis is my feminist argument for those who think that women are undesirable when they speak out for what they believe in.",

If you want equality (what feminism is supposed to be) than take a stance against anyone being asked about diet/fitness questions when it's perfectly relevant. This tunnel vision of seeing oppressed<b>  woman</b> when men get treated the same way outlines the hypocrisy of third wave feminism perfectly. And as for actresses today still just being oogle material, well that's just too ridiculous to argue against. I could list dozens of strong female supporting and lead roles that aren't sexualized at all. Obviously some roles are sexualized but men deal with that too. If a movie has a ripped lead there's almost always a shirtless scene. I'm not against feminism in any way but whe<b> n woma</b>n use it to get offended about things that equally effect men, it's no longer feminism according to feminism's very definition.",

Many of these women are just playing the game in order to make a living. If the industry and people who idolized these women respected them more for their talent rather than their looks, then they would not be obligated to dress a certain way for publicity. They simply could wear what they want, revealing or conservative, and their talent would determine their career trajectory. The fact thay we boot women from hollywood once they reach a certain <b> age,</b> which is sooner for women than men, is proof that we value the woman's appearance more than her talent.

If a women had asked a guy if he was wearing undergarment during his act I doubt it would be regarded as sexist. Please don't be fooled into thinking there is problem when there isn't. Of course there are individual cases, excluding the list on the video, that should be regarded as <b> sexism(</b>against female species for all that people think are discriminated at the present day); but for each of those examples there are multiple examples of males being discriminated as well.",

And I don't know about yall but I think dylan obrien is super hot and I have heard interviewers say things to them or comment on there appearance or training. Maybe Ariana grande because girls wear so much makeup these days and everyone is always on there phone he asked that.

Constantly asked about his clothing, hair color, sexuality, body, etc. He was a great actor, singer, and speaker, yet everyone's obsessed with knowing whether or not he was in a relationship with Frank Ocean. If you're a celebrity, whether male or female, you will be asked inappropriate questions.",

I hear men get asked that question as much as women. Or 'what do you look for in a man'. I hear men get asked 'what do you look for in a woman' much more often and never a complaint. Women are literally getting stoned to death or married at the <b> age </b>of 10 to some 40 year<b>  old</b> and no one chooses to talk about that because somehow getting asked how you handle work and your personal life is more important. There are so many situations where women have the upper hand over men but once again no one talks about that. This is why as a female I'll never call myself feminist.",

I'm sure Channing Tatum was asked a dozen times during interviews about his exercises and diet before Magic Mike came out. I will concede that women probably get these questions more often but The Rock is not a rare example, it's just when men are asked it's not treated as bad, it's more commonplace. Kinda like Joker from Dark Knight...\"If I ask a dozen male actors about their diet and exercise routine, <b> nobody </b>panics. But I ask one actress that and everyone losses their mind.\"",

It's arguably worse for women, who tend to get asked questions like \u2018how do you balance your work and personal life' - like women can't handle having a relationship and children whilst working. That question also assumes that the mother is the primary carer of the child, whereas the partner is more often than not responsible for half the care.\n\nSecondly, questions about underwear:hair colour/ diet advice are irrelevant to the job these ladies (and men!! Who get asked about work out routines too) are doing. These people are WORKING, the interview is a job, part of the promotional process for their product. They're being professional, and the interviewer is askin about personal things, which is inappropriate. Also asking about diet tips further adds to a culture where in women should all be worried about how they look, and unfortunately adds to a culture where in men feel as though they need to bulk up. This not only helps in causing eating disorders, but imagine constantly being probed about your weight - these celebrities must feel like shit all the time. (And no, just because they're famous doesn't mean it \u2018comes with the job', and No, just because they're rich doesn't mean they should just forget about it)\n\nThere is LOADS more I can say on this topic, and I don't want to sound preachy but I do hope you read through and some of what I said makes sense to you, even if you don't agree with it all.",

What really got me was the Ariana Grande question. There's<b>  nothing</b> sexist about asking that question of a girl whose phone is probably permanently glued to her hand and who's wearing an entire Sephora worth of products on her face. There'<b> s nothin</b>g sexist about asking<b>  a wom</b>an about whose dress she's wearing o<b> n a<b>  </b</b>>red carpet. Rihanna being asked what she's looking for in a man is sexist apparently, but if a guy was asked that ques<b> tion, n</b>obody would bat an eyelid. And maybe Emma Stone gets asked stupid questions because she looks like she doesn't have two brain cells to rub together. And maybe an interviewer asked Johansson what she's wearing under her catsuit. So what. It's tight as fuck. And she' hot - if she's mad at guys noticing, maybe she should wear a burka. And the Serena Williams one? God, I hope you're joking. S<b> he's a</b> woman, if you haven't noticed. SO SHE GOT ASKED WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE THE WORLD'S BEST FEMALE ATHLETE. I THINK IT WOULD BE WAY MORE DISTURBING IF THEY ASKED HER WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE THE WORLD'S BEST MALE ATHLETE. Don't you? I can't even. Honestly, if these are the worst exam<b> ples of</b> sexism you could dig up, than I don't know what the problem is. None of this was legitimate (okay, maybe the Helen Mirren one kind of was - but in case you haven't noticed, it's not the 1980s anymore). GOD!!!!!",

Why is that sexist?\n\nNumber 9 could be sexist, depending on how the speaker intentioned his question. There is <b> nothing </b>inherently misogynistic in it but could have been meant in a misogynistic way, like he could have been asking to see if the actor was cool with it etc. \n\nNumber 8 also depends on the intention of the questioner. It could be that the asker simply wanted to know if she took after the kids, or her husband or a maid etc, just for the reason that majority of the time, it is women and not men who stay home with the kids. \n\nNumber 7 I don't get what's wrong with asking a question about hair. And I don't think to say the only reason is because he was a boy. I do see how this could be seen as sexist though. \n\nNumber 6 again depends if it was a joke or real, but could be seen as sexist. \n\nNumber 5, when wearing tight clothes, you can sometimes see anything under the costume, so it is an actual question to wear her suit wasn't allowed to have those shapes and she couldn't wear anything under. Also, Stark is a main character who changed dramatically from how first movie to where he would sacrifice himself.<b>  Black</b> widow does have some character development but not close to as much. I can see how you might see this as sexist. \n\nNumber 4 again sexist? Why? It was possible that she digested for the role. It wasn't a good question but I doubt it's sexist.\n\nNumber 3 again, why is this sexist? She had a good answer, but the question wasn't sexist. And she was very fit, so he wasn't to know how. I don't get how asking diet questions is sexist...\n\nNumber 2. It was a question about 2 things she probably used often. They didn't say it was a question all girls go through, or that it was bad etc. they asked about what she would rather use. And talking about things girls often do is sexist? Men and women do different things. Obvuolsy they can do the same, but much more women use makeup for example. \n\nNumber 1 is sexist. No denying that. \n\nAlso asking what she wants in a man isn't sexist. Asking what she's wearing isn't sexist. I don't know what the exact question for Taylor Swift was, but I think was was sort of sexist",

                    "commentText": "Exactly. \n\nThe Scarlett Johansson one which people keep bringing up is a legitimate question, which is why she got asked it again and again by different interviewers.\nI've never wore a catsuit obviously as I'm a man, but as they're so skin tight, and are known to be difficult to get on, you'd wonder if they could get it on with underwear as most people apparently wear them commando. \nIt's like me with underpants/briefs, or me and tight fitting boxers, when wearing shorts. I haven't wore underpants/briefs since I was a kid, and never wear tight boxers especially when wearing shorts as it makes them roll up and chafe my inner thighs\n\nThen there's the one with Anne Hathaway who also had to squeeze into a catsuit to play Catwoman. How was asking her about her workout routine and/or diet, any different to all the male actors ie Chris Evans. Chris Hemsworth, Ben Affleck, Hugh Jackman etc who have been asked the same questions for their roles.\nIf you're playing a superhero, or any star in genres like action, martial arts, thrillers, war, or even for roles where the actor/actress had to look ill, or be a romantic interest, then they're going to be asked how they gained or lost weight for the role. Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, 50 Cent, Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Renee, Zellweger, Charlize Theron, and even Anne Hathaway are just a few people who have been through dramatic body transformations to get a role, so why she decided to flip it around, while MsMojo got offended with her by calling it sexist/misogynistic only they know.\n\nThen there's the clip of the cameraman going up Cate Blanchett's dress at the beginning. How is that sexist? Yes Cate they do the same to the men, along with asking them the same stupid questions about fashion that no-one apart from people in the industry, people studying fashion or women really care about.\n\"What are you wearing?\" Who gives a fuck really?\nNormal men like me will never be able to waste thousands of pounds/dollars on ridiculous looking clothes or designer suits even if we wanted to. And the only place you find these recommendations of how you can look like your favourite celeb are on female specific channels, the fashion sections in newspapers, or women's magazines.",

            "commentText": "I believe that women have it much much easier than men in western culture. While men have it much harder, and are therefore much more likely to live a very difficult and depressing life. But the area where women do have it worse is <b> sex </b>related harassment. Plus they have to deal with the fear of rape out in the civilian world. Which must be terrifying. That alone is some heavy shit to deal with. That and<b>  sexual</b> harassment. When it comes t<b> o sexua</b>l harassment. None of it's ok. Although some of the damage caused from a certain \"event\" is blown way out of proportion by some women sometimes. Ugh. That sounded bad. But keep reading. Like when a girl says she has had<b>  a ment</b>al breakdown and has trouble sleeping, from the time her butt was pinched. The guy who did that needs his ass kicked at the very least, But if a girl becomes that much of a wreck over her butt being touched (believe it or n<b> ot, </b>old ladies have done this to alot of us men too) then I dont think its uncalled for to assume that she might ha<b> ve a me</b>ntal issue or two that needs to be treated. As I dont think thats a normal response. Annoyance, yes. Anger, yes. Both of those are healthy and understandable responses. But trouble sleeping an<b> d and m</b>ental instability is not so understandable imo over that particular occurrence.\n\n So SOME stuff in this video sometimes falls in that area for me. In the way that women have characterized THEMSELVES. Then they get mad when consequences of that come up. Like one of the very first clips in this video. The camera man looks at her shoes then goes up, and she seriously asks \"is this something you do to the men too?\". Well, the fact that fashion is a big deal at these events. Im sure there is a man they did the same thing too if he dresses outside the norm of the other men at these shows. But even if it is only done for the women. Which is probably mostly true. What is strange or sexist about that? Dresses and womens shoes are drastically different from eachother, and other women like to even see that. Of course it makes sense for the camera man to get a look out of the womens outfits as apposed to men. Most of the men are dressed similar, and it's not really a scene men get into anyway. women themselves have culturally been much more into fashion and their looks then men have. This is just a fact. You could say there are men who care about their looks and fashion as much as women. That's true. But they are the minority when it comes to the male population. While women who are interested in looks and fashion are in the majority amongst the female population. So freaking out  about that sort of thing and calling it sexist is not just blowing it out of proportion. But it's also dishonest.\n\n Same kind of thing goes for ScarJo's reaction to being asked about underwear. While I sympathize with her reaction, and definitly do s<b> ee the </b>sexism there. It's still worth pointing o<b> ut tha</b>t Black Widows character is one that relies on using sexuality as a weapon. That fact is shown in the name of the character too. So yes, When someone sees that costume. It's going to be through a<b>  len</b>s of sex. So it does sort of make sense as to why a question involving underwear would be asked toward a women playing a character like that. Plus she's wearing a cat suit. So I think the question was more about the curiosity over panty lines. Which again. does not apply to any of the other heroes. It's a qeustion that can only really<b>  apply</b> to Black widow at all.",

It doesn't matter if people who want women to be overpowered call themselves feminists, cause they aren't and that doesn't change the definition of the word. People who believe that men should be under women are called female chauvinists. So so matter the circumstancesm every single time you use feminist as a downgrading word, you're saying that equality is a ton of bullshit and that women belong in the kitchen. So please for fks sake, if you wanna stomp on someone use women/female chauvinism instead. Cause thats what female overpower is. Not feminism.",

Apart from my oldest sister, the other 13 female members of my family love their dresses, shoes, make-up, handbags, perfumes etc.\n\nThen there's game shows where when asked what they'd spend the money on if they won, men usually reply with things like a holiday, a car, or something for their house, while the women most of the time say holiday, I've seen shit loads of women recently say they'd get a make-over, new dresses for their wardrobe, a spa/pampering weekend, and new shoes or handbags (even when they've admitted to owning 100's already).\n\nIt's a fact that most women care more about how they look and feel than anything else, which is why they'd rather spend any extra money they have on making themselves look and feel good, unless they have kids of course.\n\nIt's also a fact that most women spend more time on websites like Facebook or Twitter making status updates, posting selfies or checking in to places, than men do. (I'm an exception to that rule as I'm online almost 24/7 when I'm not watching my films or TV shows).\n\nAriana Grande in every single video she's full of make up, and always trying to look sexy, like a typical <b> woman.</b> I can't say I know what her social media habits are like as I don't follow her Facebook/Twitter/Instagram etc, but by the looks of it she does a few posts a week on each.\n\nNow asking her to choose between her make-up or her phone, would be like asking me to choose between watching my football team or watching my favourite TV shows.

He wasn't asked when he was a teenager, because like me and every other guy on the planet, we couldn't give a fuck about diet. \nI went to an all boys school with 1000+ pupils. Practically every single one of those pupils played Football in the mornings, on their morning break, on their lunch break, and after school too. Hardly any of us sat down in a canteen to eat, as most of us ate while we walked. Sandwiches, sausage rolls, pizza slices, fries, burgers, hotdogs etc, or sweets were the type of things we ate on our way to play Football, therefore most people were still hungry after school so everyone who had money got scallop butties, fish and chips, sausage butties, 'school specials' etc from the fish and chip shop across the road, or went to the bakery to buy things like iced buns every single day. \nWe're not like girls, we don't obsess over our appearance. We got fit by having fun playing Football constantly, yet the girls at our all girl sister school down the road, never bothered exercising from the look of things. Whenever us older 16-18yo's in 6th form went down to the all girls school for lessons, to meet someone, or on our way to way to town, the girls would mainly all be sitting down doing <b> nothing </b>on their breaks. There was hardly anyone playing hopscotch, skipping, netball or whatever else girls play, so no wonder they obsess over their weight as they rarely do exercise as teenagers. It was exactly the same in my nearby neighbourhoods at home. There was at least 20 of us in the neighbourhood to my left, and while all the guys were playing Rugby, Football or riding our bikes, the girls would be sitting down watching us. It was similar in the neighbourhood to my right, while the guys were running around playing Football or riding our bikes, the girls would be sitting down doing<b>  nothing</b>. The only games the girls ever played was 'Kerby' where you throw a ball at the kerb to make it bounce back to you, standing still the majority of the time.\n\n3 - It's blatantly obvious you're a kid bringing up shit modern rappers. Obviously they won't be asked the same questions, because as I said on the post above yours most females are obsessed with looks and material things. They'd most likely be asked to choose between something like 'Weed or Music'.",

I personally play xbox. far more men play xbox then women. so of an interviewer asked me to choose xbox or cell phone would that be sexist. The answer is no, it's a question based in real observations. as far as the young girl dieting.

Man  may get qns  like would u cut your hair or lose your phone wherelese  women may receive less of this sort of qns  .why? it's because men   place a large emphasis on our hair  and it is our form of creativity not saying women can't do their hair but the main point is yes men place a great emphasis on hair so qns  like that are bound to be ask .and ONE QN  THAT ACTRESSES do not like  and that is on dieting  .Firstly why do women get dieting  questions more than man it is simply because women beco<b> me obe</b>se more easily than man  (this is not just random bs   [LINK]  read up the article ) because they bec<b> ome ob</b>ese more easily it is normal for them to go on a diet more frequently .U see  man and  women have our good and bad points .in case ppl  say I am not equal let me give u a advantage  of women in comparison  to man .women are naturally more smarter than man if u go check it up there is a higher number of graduates  that are women than man so women are autually better than man in terms of academics .

Usually the men are outside the Top 200 in the rankings, yet they still beat the top female tennis players.\nKarsten Braasch ranked 203rd in the world, played both the Williams sisters one after another, on a day where he had played golf earlier in the day, had done no training, had a couple of shandies, and didn't play to his full potential, yet he still smashed them.\nThe only time a<b>  woman</b> has won (without something like a points advantage) was Billie Jean King against a 55yo Bobby Riggs.

That's why videos like that are usually taken down. The concept of watch/ms mojo's videos is rating things. they use short clips of the content which are either from completely different pieces of content (such as this video) or are clips from completely different moments in the same piece of media (i.e. \"best moments from x tv show\"). Someone can (hypothetically) upload the majority of the footage of a movie/song/TV episode if there is reason to believe that their intent is criticism/comment/parody.\n\nAnd in terms of point #2: Watch/Ms Mojo's videos (even without their commentary) are not in any way a replacement for the original pieces of media that it talks about. Uploading an entire movie unedited is absolutely a replacement for seeing the movie in the cinema or buying a hardcopy, thus it is copyright infringement. To use the top video in the recommended bar right now as an example: \"Top 10 Friends jokes that would NOT work on TV today\".  The 8-9 minute video on one very specific aspect of the show is nowhere near a replacement for the 121 hours of content of Friends. In this video, showing a single answer (or even sometimes just half of an answer) is not a replacement for the original footage of the interviews.\n\nThis is clearly the hypothetical. YouTube in particular is absolute BS nowadays. They will demonetize/mute/take down your video for 3 seconds of copyrighted music and people are being sued over videos which are undeniably fair use cough H3H3 cough , but I'm talking about what the law actually says.",

            "commentText": "This whole list apart from the underwear question and the Helen Mirren clip, is just a bunch of too bit snobs complaining about <b> nothing.</b> There is a reason women get asked about beauty and fitness. The answer is that those things are inherent parts of femininity. This is not to say that there is no<b>  sexism</b> in a lot of Hollywood but these were just not examples of it at all. I mean really, going on a radio show that is know for it's degeneracy and then cr<b> y sexis</b>m when you get asked a question abo<b> ut s</b>ex is like going into a candy store and being outraged that they have licorice; You would prefer they not have it but you knew it was a high possibility. The fitness questions posed to Scarlett and Anne were exactly the question that should be asked along with other things but just think about it logically without <b> the SEX</b>ISM glasses. Both of these women stepped into roles that are extremely physically demanding, I mean with the amount of flips and spin kicks they both do my god. So is it then not interesting to hear about the most likely, intensive fitness regiment that they had to endure to play these iconic roles? Just as the same type of question was posed to Sylvester, Chris Evens, and Gal Gadot and many other actors both male and female through out movie history when they play physically taxing roles or even mentally. The diet bit posed to the kid was a<b>  bit w</b>eird but hardly sexist and then her little rant about womens images was just BS and also sexist; 1 for blaming man for women choosing to buy loads of cosmetics and 2 for removing the agency of women to act in their own self interests. Lastly the most comical of all. The Ariana piece was just plain laughable. So she pedals garbage and calls it music but then to supplement the garbage she over sexualizes every single song she puts out by dressing like a pornstar with the makeup all caked on literally selling her sexuality in all of them and then as the nerve to complain <b> about s</b>exism. I'm sorry but no. To answer the question; Yes that is exactly two things that girls would struggle to choose between for the most part Just as a choice between PC or Console would be to boys for the most part. Also th<b> ere is n</b>othing inherently sexist about asking girl type questions to girls and the same for boys just as you would ask Rap type questions to Jay Z. This Damn list is a sh<b> ame. ha</b> Sexism.. I should put my boot upside your head and <b> show yo</b>u sexism sigh.",

First; Tailoring questions towards the person you are interviewing is a practices as <b> old </b>as time, in fact, anyone who doesn't do this shouldn't be allowed to do interviews. Second; If you believe that asking  an actress( or actor) about their physical appearance is somehow a<b>  dumb</b> down question, then the only sexist here is you. Their whole job revolves around there bloody physical appearance and what little actual acting or vocal talent they got ( good acting die a while back, in case you didn't realize.) That is the essence of Hollywood and the LA machine, using your good looks to make money becaus<b> e se</b>x sells. so you don't get to blame men for buy it( oh women by it too). Now as for the Ariana hang up. I never said she should be treated like shit, that was all you. What I said was that if you spend your days as a house builder, you shouldn't be taken aback when someone starts asking about the fucking brick work. As for the \"Shoot yourself\" bit, I'll think about it the next time I have to read stupid comments like yours. P.s. Everything I said can be flipped to the opposi<b> te gend</b>er and still make sense, what you wrote however wouldn't even hold water if a female interviewr asked Brad Pit about his killer abs, which they do... a lot.

You CHOSE to go commando in a dress that could be open when you got out of the car.  You KNEW it could happen.  And now you're \"unwilling\"?\n\nWTF??????\n\nI will concede that it was sleazy and gross for the photographer to publish the shot.  Paparazzi is fucked up.  I will concede that the same way that I fully believe that<b>  nobody</b> deserves to be raped for wearing a miniskirt in a dark ally.  The rapist is at fault for committing rape.  Yes.  Of course.  That's easy.  So I will concede that a sleazy photographer is at fault for doing sleazy things.\n\nBut I DO NOT UNDERSTAND how she was \"unwilling\" when she fucking chose to wear no underwear.  I'm unwilling to show my junk to people, so I wear underwear.  I wear miniskirts almost every day, and I wear fucking underwear when I don't want people to see my junk.\n\nShe's probably embarrassed, and she probably regrets it.  Fine.  But how can she be \"unwilling\" when she chose to go fucking commando?\n\nGod damn, it's not rocket science.\n\nHowever, she does get major points with \"Are you trying to fit into a catsuit?\"  That was great. :)",

If you look at the most popular feminist movements, in general, feminists have very toxic ideas. For example I listed several below.\n\nWage Gap - (Fallacy)\nAccording to the US Department of Labor (feel free to look this up) men work on average at least 4 more hours than women do every week. 52 weeks in a year makes at least 208 more hours on average. If men are working over 200 hours than <b> woman </b>a year, then of course the medians will be higher. The idea that men are paid more for the same job is a false extrapolation from a statistical median in a distribution of data points.\n\nFree The Nipple Movement - (Vulgarity and Hypocrisy)\nI cannot think of a more useless movement if I can be honest. I can be drafted and die at war because I have a Y chromosome and women do not have to because they have two X's, yet they want to complain about<b>  sexism</b>? Both women and men have struggles, but I do not see the majority of feminists also fighting SERIOUS mens' issues like alarmingly high suicide rates, but yeah let's free the nipple? Hypocrisy. <b> \n\nPatriarch</b>y - (Imaginary)\nWomen have higher IQ's and grades then men on average. Women have better access to college grants/scholarships, healthcare, and government aid simply because they are<b>  a wom</b>an. I do not see evidence of this mythical group trying to hold women back. If anything men have historically been told to sacrifice their time, finances, and even lives for women w<b> ith noth</b>ing in return. I see more evidence of a \"Matriarchy\" haha.\n\nRape Culture - (Toxicity)\nFeminists will say that we live in a rape culture because some men have raped and got away with it. By that same logic we must also live in a murder culture, thief culture, and littering culture. Do these cultures exist? Are there some men out there who want to rape? Yes of course, but to call a whole country a rape culture based on these rare accounts is simply inaccurate. This country is not \"pro rape\", I have never met someone in my life who thought rape was a good idea. Our laws are against rape and rapists, especially child rapists, go to prison for a long time as they should. Yes the court system makes mistakes, but those minorities do not stand for the 300+ million people who live in the U.S. We do not live in a rape culture for the same reason who do not live in a murder culture, and telling young men that they are all potential rapists is deplorable and shows the toxicity and bias of feminism against men.\n\nThese are just 4 myths and toxic ideas that are associated with feminism. Based on these ideas, you can define modern feminist ideas to be, in general, toxic. Thank you for reading.",

                    "commentText": "Joshua Fyfe Well, it's good you're a believer in the statistics. However, what you've (sort of) cited doesn't dismiss the wage gap problem, it kinda reinforces it. Average work hours actually only differs by 0.4 hours per day which amounts to only 2 hours per week. That means women work on average 95% than that of men, but still only earn 79% the wage... Obviously that's still leaves a 16% gap (depending, of course, on your <b> ethnicity.</b>) However, this hourly average only refers to only paid additional hours... so it's not exactly the most reliable as this could go either way: either women don't work longer hours, or they do but just don't get paid the extra hours. Studies have shown that women actually work on average 50 minutes more per day than men in unpaid workplace labour. So, if men work 24 minutes more per day in paid labour, then women are still working an additional 26 minutes more than men per day - meaning women work 4% more than men. Also, higher paying jobs tend to have longer hours - so, if women arn't being hired to higher paying jobs, then of course they arn't racking up the additional 24 minutes of paid labor each day - and, given that women in the West tend to hold more degrees than men, it begs the question why men continue to get the higher paying jobs? You'll never convince me discrimination against women in the workplace (which leads to the pay gap) doesn't exists - because not only is it statistically supported, I've seen it over and over and over again. A\u00a0supervisory position came up in an office, containing 38 women and 1 man (minus the existing manager). 14 women candidates with post-secondary education, 5 to 30 years of experience, and most regularly worked after hours (unpaid) applied. The 1 man (my friend), who had only been employed for 8 months, didn't have a post-secondary education, and didn't stay a minute after finish time (not that he has to, it's his right) was the one who was hired. In another office, my colleague reported to our boss that she was pregnant, and his response was to tell her that she had \"thrown her career out the window.\" During her maternity leave, they surplused her job, renamed it, denied her application and gave the \"new\" job to a man. She had a month to find a new job within the company and as a result took a $2000/week pay cut.\u00a0\n\n\nI don't even know how to respond to your offense to \"Free the Nipple\", other then to roll my eyes. 'Vulgar', really? I mean... you're just reaching for anything at this point.... Like, who cares of some women want to go topless just like men are allowed to go topless? This is your definition of toxic?\n\n<b> \nPatriarchy</b> isn't a mythical illuminati group, it's a social system which has been built upon since the dawn of time. I mean, I think we can all recognize that things were pretty shitty for women rights on paper up to the last century... Women couldn't vote until the 20s, you could legally be fired for getting pregnant before the 60s, couldn't get a credit card without a male co-signer until the 70s, it wasn't until the 90s that you were allowed to refus<b> e se</b>x with your husband... that's not that long ago. I'll back up...<b> . 'patriarc</b>hy' is a social system\u00a0established by\u00a0men in predominate in roles of political and moral leadership.\u00a0 On a basic level, we can look at the U.S. Congress.... The record high is 20% women.... In a country where 50% of the population is women. Even with that \"record\" high, Trump couldn't even pick a sin<b> gle wo</b>man to join the\u00a013-member group\u00a0working on health care legislation.\u00a0In terms of religious institutions... it's even worse.\u00a0By definition tha<b> t is patria</b>rchy.\u00a0So, of course the male perspective has dominated and shaped society - it's only logical. What is illogical is the belief that it somehow died over night - exactly what date do you be<b> lieve patri</b>archy\u00a0 was over? It's not a boogeyman, it's not men consciously (with some exceptions) trying to oppress women, it's a tradition\u00a0that we have been raised with, which is why it is harder for some people to recognize it.\n\n\nRape culture... I think I'm seeing a pattern of why you're getting it wrong. For one, you're defensive because you think feminism is an attack on men. Secondly, you can't seem to grasp the nuances. Third, the concept you do have of these terms is very superficial, and, for the most part, just wrong. Rape culture isn't about how many perpetrators are locked up... It's about the normalization of non-cons<b> ensual </b>sexual relationships, combined with historical patriarchal constructs, which lead to dangerous behaviour against women and yes, influences the justice system. Keep it in mind then next time you watch a movie or a TV shoe - it's very evident there in all the antics men use to \"get the girl\". Consider how these would play out in the real world, and consider what message was interpreted from it and how maybe it impacted your view of flirting... Then compare them to the reactions to assault allegations - there is a very clear line there.\n\nRegardless, I understand that \"toxic\" is the new favorite buzzword for anti-feminists, but, I still don't see anywhere you've shown how these concepts are toxic.... You just keep saying toxic... How?",

                    "commentText": "Candice Nicole oh my lord, that was one of the most painful things I have ever had the displeasure of reading. You seriously couldn't be more delusional of you tried. Every single one of your \"talking points\" have been debunked a million times by much smarter people than either of us.\n\nYour wage gap rant was particularly torturous. Anecdotal evidence proves <b> nothing.</b> And your \"statistics\" are extremely inaccurate. But forget statistics, seeing as no economist in the world will tell you the wage gap exists. It is an incredibly simple concept. Take whatever number you see fit for the argument, but I'll use the 77% one seeing as that is the most<b>  common</b>. All men combined, earn a grand total of X amount. And all women combined, make 77% of X. That is how the number is derived. There are practically an infinite amount of factors to why that is. But it isn't ONLY because o<b> f sexis</b>m, or even a big part of it. That is complete and utter nonsense. The fact is, that it is completely illegal to pay 2 people different wages for the same job, regardless <b> of gend</b><b> er, r</b>ace, or what have you. Women don't get paid less for doing the same job. It's incredibly simple. Women and men just make different choices. Just like white people<b>  and b</b>lack people make different choices, or Asian people and Latino people make different choices, etc etc... The wage gap is a complete and utter myth.\n\n\"Free the nipple\". While that isn't necessarily \"toxic\"... The hypocrisy meter just exploded. Women don't want to be sexualized, and<b>  yell s</b>exual harassment when a man fawns over a woman's cleavage... But they want to walk around with their tits out and demand that be normal? Lol the level of delusion people like you spew has ceased to amaze me. You do realize the video in which you are commenting on, do you? Where all these \"sexist\" questions were only ones directed at women, none at men. And most of these women got offended by questions about their physical appearance... But they want to free the nipple? Lmao hilariously delsuional and hypocriti<b> cal.\n\n\"Patr</b>iarchy isn't a mythical illuminati group.\" No, but it is a completely useless, meaningless, and made up word. I'm not at all claiming discrimination doesn't exist, it absolutely does. Women had it worse off than men, ju<b> st lik</b>e black people had it worse off than white people for a long time. But we don't live in those days anymore. Everyone has their rights. \"So of course the male perspective has dominated and shaped society, it's only logical.\" No, it's only \"logical\" to someone as delusional as you. Sure, that could be true to some extent. But that doesn't at all mean that \"women are oppressed today\". Utter nonsense. By claiming thin<b> gs like \"pa</b>triarchy\", \"rape culture\" and \"white privilege\", you're actually setting the conversation backwards. You aren't pointing to ACTUAL<b>  cases </b>of<b>  sexism</b> or racism... Rather you're just implying that men are sexist just for being men, or that white<b>  people</b> are racist just for being white. Oh right, but they're not doing it \"consciously\", right? \"It's not men consciously trying to oppress women, it's a tradition that we have been raised with, which is why it's harder for some people to recognize it.\" Ohhhhhhh... it's \"subconscious bias\", I got ya. So it's not just that men are inherently sexist, but they're inherently sexist, without even knowing it. Wow. Ummm, did you say something about a boogeyman? Because you just created one. Like Ben Shapiro says, point out the sexist law, or sexist person, and I will stand with you and fight against it. But \"unconscious bias\" is a ghost of a ghost. There's no solution to that. But more importantly, there's absolutely no proof of that either.\n\n\"You're defensive because you think feminism is an attack on men.\" Well, yes. It absolutely is to an extent. It's also an atnnttack on women. By demanding more rights than men, you're not only hurting men, but also saying that women need outside help to a become equal. Which is completely contradictory to feminism. \"You can't seem to grasp the nuances.\" You failed to mention what these \"nuances\" are you speak of. \"Keep that is mind the next time you watch a movie or TV show.\" Wow, are you seriously getting your \"real life\" examples from Hollywood? Lmao the most liberal place on the planet? OF COURSE hollywood is superficial and sexist towards women... But implying there is a rape culture in America, is just about as insane a thing as one could say. America has rape statistics that battle those of the Congo? What a bunch of nonsense.\n\nWhat is extremely telling about you though, just like the content of the video we are commenting on... is that in your whole rape culture rant, was only about men towards women, just like this video only shows sexist questions toward women, and none towards men. It's clear you're of the notion that only men can be sexist, just like only white p<b> eople c</b>an be racist, etc... It just exposes the massive double standard people like you have, and a<b> re abs</b>olutely blind to it.",

If you compare different groups of people based on whatever factor you'd like, you are always going to come up with different numbers. They will never be the same. Women and men make different choices. Women tend to go into less risky jobs than men. They tend to work less hours. More women are stay at home parents than men. More men work overtime and take less vacation. And before you get on me for being sexist, I never said \"all\" women this, or \"all\" women that. But speaking generally, those are statistically true. Again, there are a million factors why the numbers aren't the same. And they are all more valid factors than <b> \"sexism</b>\".",

The true assumption here - which Murray couldn't wait to pounce on in a display of gesture 'politics' - is that the interviewer is deliberately negating the success of female tennis stars. I don't believe he was doing that. When the subject of the interview is the men's game that Murray - a man - has just won it's obvious what the interviewer is referring to. If a female sports star was being interviewed by a <b> woman </b>and reference was made to her 'unique' success I doubt if the female sports star  would have interjected in defence of  a man achieving a similar thing. Murray was totally disingenuous and you'd have to query why he would want to be so.",

My argument is that Murray's interviewer was doing no such thing and it was Murray's 'political' gesturing that turned the innocent appraisal of his achievement into a sexist issue. If Murray had taken the remark as it was intended there would have been no further reference to it, anyone with a shred of sense would have realised exactly what the interviewer implied. It was Murray's attempt at male 'feminism' that escalated it into something it never was. \n\n As for 'cultural and linguistic inequality' - only someone intent on misrepresentation and advancing a dead-in-the-water agenda could coin such a nonsensical statement. 'Cultural norms and unspoken assumptions'.... Give an example where a 'cultural norm' negates a female achievement? Give an example of an 'unspoken assumption' widely used to deride female success. You look for implied slight where none exists to validate what you prefer to believe. It's the quicksand foundation of every feminist/leftist/SJW et al and the reason why all their so-called 'arguments' are torn to shreds.",

In that era women were naturally more <b> thin,</b> and with smaller breasts, so seeing a<b>  woman</b> who had more packing up top was very rare. It's only obvious for someone to question if her bigger breasts were distractions, seeing as how every other female actress in that era was more or less flat chested. They didn't understand the appeal of bigger breasts, and couldn't fathom how they played into acting roles, because smaller breasts were the \"normal\" in those days.\nIn fact, bigger breasts are only seen as normal today because they're mostly fake or chemically enhanced. Our food today has fattening chemicals injected into it, which actually heighten <b> a woma</b>n's curves, but with the downside that it could also make her gain more weight than she wanted. Beer is also popular for both sexes now, when in the past wine and champagnes were seen as female-only drinks, and beer for men. Beer is brewed with many chemicals that help enlarge breasts. It is uncommon for women to have natural big breasts even today.",

How many times has Chris Pratt been asked about his workout routine to get in shape for Guardians of the Galaxy?  Some of the questions asked of male <b> sex </b>symbols, by female interviewers, are quite<b>  sexual</b> in nature.  \n\nThe difference is how we view them.  When a man asks a female celebrity <b> a sexua</b>l question, we now see it as sexist and creepy.  When<b>  a wom</b>an asks a male celebrit<b> y a sex</b>ual question, we view her as edgy and embracing her sexuality.  When a female celebrity has her nudes taken and spread around on the internet, it's terrible and she's a victim.  But those same people who complain about that, are often quick to take a peek a circulating photo of Justin Bieber's junk.  \n\nI guess I'm just not a fan of how we inconsistently view these things.  We see it as sexist when an interviewer asks a female celebrity if she'd rather give up makeup or her cell phone, two stereotypical female interests, but we wouldn't bat an eye at an interviewer who asked a young male celebrity if he'd rather give up beer or video games.",

It is widely known that George Lucas didn't allow under garments for men or women during the filming of the original trilogy.  So, the underwear questions are not surprising.  The guys in Batman or MCU aren't wearing skin tight outfits.  Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans are often asked about their workout regiment, but I didn't see those questions on here.  Also, women ask the same questions to other women and some women employ male reporters and require them to ask certain questions for their publication or broadcast to get an outrageous response that will get them readers or viewers.   Best sexist response, in my opinion, was when a daytime TV show host asked Zac Efron if she could see him without his shirt on and he replied, \"You first.\" Which she laughed off, covering her cleavage with a blue card.  How about we see the number of Daytime TV hosts who grope male stars or make lewd comments about their bodies, if we are truly interested in equality?",

How is that sexist this narrator is clearly a feminist if you are offended by that question the problem is not with the question itself it's with you. Men actors get diets and exercise questions all the time it's not sexist to ask a female the same question. And I really wish females who get offended by beauty questions would grow up, attraction is what drives American entertainment stop acting like people who ask questions about your figure are sexist for doing so, attack the Kardashian's, bikinis, short shorts, belly shirts, squats, plastic surgeon, and human beings natural attraction to female/male body's don't act like women don't like certain celebrities cause of there looks",

Men do get sexualized and objectified all the time - it's expected that guys are supposed to just 'take it' and not go into an emotional tailspin over it.

You're using your narrow-minded view of the world to try and turn feminism around to make women seem like the problem, did you actually watch this video in it's entirety, or are you just trying to nitpick everything out of it that perhaps seems minutely contradictory to you? Ariana Grande may well be using her body to enhance her career, however that doesn't mean that she isn't working hard on creating her music and videos, and clearly you're drawn to the superficial, rather than drawing on the merits of her actual work! Besides, the interview clip on this particular video mentions <b> nothing </b>about her being sexualised, it was YOU who made that insinuation, the interviewer in question was focussing on superficial items that women and girls supposedly can't live without, rather than talking about her work, which was obviously the main reason for her being on that particular show. Why would one spend money in trying to get these guests, and then spend half the time asking sexist questions?! Seriously, stop trying to over-inflate your already rather sizeable ego by trying to suggest that men have it just as bad, because you have COMPLETELY missed the point of this video, and I implore you to go and educate yourself about the history of women's rights, there's some pretty fucked up shit that women and girls have had to go through to get to where they are now! We still live in a patriarchal society, and whilst the balance is being addressed, there's still a long way to go, and people like you who deny that feminism is necessary are not in any way helping address that balance!",

Well it's one you probably won't want to hear because it involves women such as yourself being able to look at both sides of an issue and dealing with opposing opinions. And you've just shown your lack of capability in doing so with your generalized, and rather sexist comment \"Men and their entitlement I swear\". Case in point. I'm curious as to your description of \"men like me\", since you don't know a thing about me.\n\n\n\nAnd for the record? I actually didn't comment on Grande's sexuality or body. My point is that when you sexualize yourself (whether male or female) as part of your career, don't be surprised when people comment about it. Grande isn't some naive little girl. She knows exactly what she's doing.",

I'm speaking strictly about choosing to sexualize oneself as part of a \"brand\", but then expecting everyone to only be interested in your myriad intellectual complexities. Pop culture has rarely worked that way - and probably never really will. If you're gonna use sexualization as a device, then be adult enough to handle all the different reactions you're going to get without getting perpetually offended. I guarantee most guys are called 'fragile' when they express any of the kinds of reactions featured in this video.\n\nOn the flip side, I maybe could characterize you (or women who share your ideas) as people who see <b> sexism </b>everywhere and try to push the narrative that women are perpetual victims at all times in our culture, with no hope of recourse. And I think that's a crock.\n\nAnd one more time: you're not the content police. And I'm not telling any channel what to do - but rather QUESTIONING why they don't have a more equal approach. Feedback and comments are a quintessential part of the youtube community. So maybe it's you who needs to create a channel...and then disable all your comments so you never have to read them.",

The case I'm building actually isn't that men have it just as bad - but rather that women don't have it AS perpetually bad as some of them are constantly claiming. Nor did I say anywhere that women are a/the problem. I imagine that you and Erela are perhaps comparing notes and figuring out how to twist my words into something that justifies your childish outrage. I respect women - and am a fan of feminism if it promotes equality rather than this co-opted bullshit that turns feminism into a competition and constantly vilifies men...AND immobilizes women by painting them as constant victims. We do not live in a patriarchal society OR a rape culture. Western women are probably some of the most (if not THE most) respected, exalted, and catered-to women on the planet - and many of these inflated \"issues\" pale in comparison to what happens to women in may other parts of the world. So while you're stroking your OWN ego blustering about how socially conscious and 'woke' you are, maybe take your own advice and learn more about the oppression of women in other societies and the <b> sex </b>trafficking industry (which is unfortunately alive and well). Then get back to me about how some of these poor, marginalized, millionaire pop stars and actresses have it so bad. Get some goddam perspective, dude.",

                    "commentText": "Hawkfeather I applaud your objective, rational stance on the true definition of the word \"equality\". However, I disagree that we \"have a long way to go\". For cultures other than the West, this is very true. But in Western culture, specifically the US, social differences in regard to <b> gender </b>have significantly narrowed. Single women in the largest cities in the US are, on average, earning higher salary than single men in the same cities. Does this differ when factoring in maternity leave/having children? Absolutely. But even when this is factored in, most of the differences can still be explained by reasonable causes. I've worked at 3 different enterprise-level businesses, and 2 out of the 3 offer paid maternity leave and have a general preference of hiring women over men for various positions. In my first position as a graduate, I was paid less than my female counterparts in the exact same role who only had roughly 6 or 8 months more in tenure than me, which I was perfectly fine with. After about a year and a half, however, I was able to do the job faster and more efficient, and successfully negotiated a pay raise because of that, which many women choose not to approach.\n\nMen will always be protective and caring over women, as it is in their biology. A growing number of women see this as appalling, when in reality it should be valued. That is how many animal species have survived and grown over the years. Men also enjoy being cared for by women, although some will never admit this. But for this same reason, many men do not want women to be forcibly drafted, because we are meant to protect them. Our survival as a species also depends upon the survival of women.\n\nAs for the issue of male<b>  doctors</b> and refusing to remove uteruses, this sounds like a very unique and uncommon case, but I would always urge for people to research both sides of a story. Have they sought second opinions from othe<b> r doctor</b>s? Additionally, although it is possible for a spouse to send his or her partner to a psychiatric ward, there are several conditions that must be met, such as eye-witness testimony, and the person signing the petition would need to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the partner is in need of psychiatric assistance, so unless those women falsely admitted to their alleged behavior, and an independent psychiatrist documented it as being authentic, there's simply no way this would happen. There are far too many conditions that have to be met. Otherwise, people would send anyone they didn't like away to a psych ward for no reason.",

Say you're not into it if you're not and change the subject or talk about it if you are. \n\nMen like talking about their interests. Women don't? They just like to nag and argue against complements amd small talk? I don't believe that. Look at Craig Ferguson. He had great interviews with women, ran the gamut of topics and was never called sexist. These interviewers are just too awkward and scripted and don't know how to ad lib and adapt the questions to the interview. They come off as disingenuous.",

There are many similar questions you could ask a guy. if a guy wears a sports jersey 3 days a week and is on record as doing so, its not sexist for a female interviewer to ask him if he would rather give up sports or his phone.(even though not every guy is into sports.)The reason the hosts started laughing and joking seems like they were trying to make humor and diffuse a needlessly awkward situation.",

Feminists also perpetuate lies like the wage gap. The wage gap is just the median numbers in the distributions in wages of men and women. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, men on average work at least 4 more hours weekly then women do. 52 weeks in a year makes at least 208 more hours a year. OF COURSE THEY WILL GET PAID MORE after 208+ hours and that is not even taking into account the different jobs men and women work. \n\nMen tend to choose riskier high paying jobs, and honestly it is one of the reason 70% of homeless people are men: because they take more risks. I do not even believe this to be a good trait, but homeless people do not earn a wage and thus do not bring down the statistical means and medians of the distributions concerning men's wages down or lower. Also, the top 10 degrees men chose out of college are far higher paying than the top 10 women choose. These are just different choices that lead to higher/lower on average pay.\n\nSummary: The wage gap is a myth and not even feminist economists take it seriously. Do you accept that many feminists are lying about the wage gap and will you denounce this obvious lie?",

On the other hand, though \"mansplaining\" can be quite a... controversial term I suppose, it doesnt mean \"explaining done by men\". It means \"a man chose to barge in with explanations withou checking the credentials of anyone else in the conversation, assuming that his were better than anyone else's in the room\", i.e. that he was the expert by default.  \nThere's a researcher in Australia called Spencer or smtg who actually did an experiment on something sorta akin to what I wrote.

Please show any kind of research whatsoever, because that is such a boldly false claim. The term \"rape culture\" is such a broad and vague term, and implies that \"everywhere\" there are rape statistics that are similar to that of the Congo. Which is nonsense.\n\nI'm sorry, today's feminism purposely misuses, misrepresents, and sometimes outright lie about many \"statistics\".

But it really depends on the individual person. Some people like shopping, some people animals. Some men like shopping. Some girls like spots. It's not really that. And not every girl just has make up and phones, what about the girls in other countries who are poorer? Also their are societies where boys exclusively wear make up. So, it's not like every single girl loves her make up and phone. Im sure a lot do, but like, beauty has a bunch of different connotations around the world. It's not just, \"shop and makeup make me feel pretty\". What makes me feel pretty personally is when someone compliments my smile, or laughs at my jokes. But that's just me :P",

The thing most feminists forget is that feminism is about equality for both women AND men, I've never ever seen any feminist talk about the inequality for men. Instead of bringing up subjects like the fact that men who rape have a way longer prison sentence than women who rape, or the fact that the number of men committing suicide is the double of the number of women who commit suicide, instead they talk about how Ariana grande got asked if she'd choose makeup or her phone. The definition of a social movement does not define the mindset of the people in it. And do NOT for the love of god pull that \"omg stop being so sexist!\" Crap on me, I am a white female and I can happily say that I am not and will probably never be a feminist.",

When we won, everyone was so surprised to the point that half of them lost the meaning of morality and respectfulness. A guy who usually works on the media and takes video had the audacity to ask us, 'how did you GUYS win with the extra baggage?' he then proceeded to give me a pointed look and immediately looked away when I gave him my moms evil eye. He emphasized on guys like only they were smart and I was just the burden. Thankfully the guys in my group immediately got on his ass for the rude comment.",

Sexi</b>sm happens to both sexes, male & female. Yes, it does happen to women much more often than men, so it's understandable if the wo<b> rd 'sex</b>ism' just immediately reminds you of a guy who's at fault. However, it's WRONG to think that it just happens to<b>  one ge</b>nder, and that it'<b> s NOT s</b>exism if the position is reversed. It's kind of the same situation with rape. If a guy raped a female, then he would be thrown behind bars, bu<b> t if a</b> woman did it, it might be shrugged off. \n\nI just don't like how some words are directed at a s<b> pecific</b> gender, like how feminists HAVE to be women. I am sure there are plenty of men out there who vouch and campaign for equal rights of BOTH genders, both male & female. The point that I'm really getting at is *equality*. If we all want equality, we have to stop pitting one against another. We have to *STOP GENERALIZING*. I know some people might describe me as \"butthurt\", but honestly,<b>  this is</b> nothing about being butthurt. This is about society progressing forward with a better future in mind.\n\nThanks for reading my rant.",

I do remember women being protected countless times by men and I do remember women being able to always have a strong relationship with their children while their husbands were breaking their backs to provide. \nThe way I see it, women have gotten the better deal for a long time. Women have been seen as precious and in need of protection above all else (except maybe children) because they're capable of bearing children. \nBased on biology alone, we men are less valuable to society and you can see it both in history and reflected within society today.\nI'm not saying women didn't struggle throughout history, but for gods sake you CANNOT say that 'men have been over women for the past 2017 years'. That is just plainly false. I would just love it if feminists could pay tribute to the countless men who have sacrificed themselves for women, who have toiled in terrible jobs day after day to provide for women, who have protected women and who have blindly and wrongly accepted the societal idea that we are biologically less valuable. I would like feminists to acknowledge their own privilege for once, but do you think that will ever happen? Hahahahaha,no.",

Huw Jackman especially when he did les mis and I'm sure I've seen those questions for a lot of the male superhero actors. I feel the point is to point out how dedicated they are to making the character work that they do so much to make themselves look like that character. Also with the spider man comics was gwen (pretty sure she wasn't MJ in the garfield movies) blonde because that might explain why she got so many questions about hair colour if the hair colour was different to the comics. That one interviewer seemed so mysoginst and it showed how often he seemed to be in the top ten and that he didn't even know he was doing anything wrong (the do you wear any underwear? question",

                    "commentText": "+Jessica Cortez I didn't read this whole thread because it started to go the way of being petty, but perhaps I can offer you some things to think about. One thing straight off the bat- it is not the feminist's responsibility to advocate for men. Feminists can and do support men, but if you or anyone else has a problem with men not being supported enough, then you and/ or they are welcome to stand up against that. Don't expect other people to hold your values and fight for them in order to get your approval if you won't do anything for your values yourself. Next, yes, women experience <b> sexism </b>and<b>  sexual</b> harassment and abuse much more than men do. That is something that needs to stop. The rate, frequency, and severity that men experience it worldwide and historically is astronomically dwarfed by how often and to what degree it happens to women. There's no two ways around that. Please don't try to minimize it by saying that it happens to men too as if that makes any sort o<b> f sexua</b>l mistreatment fair or acceptable. Lastly, your own examples against men also point to how little women are considered. Part of the reason th<b> at wom</b>an-on-man misconduct and crime is so easily blown off is because of how far below men women are still considered. Male celebrities being touched, made to strip, receiving pornographic images, and getting lap dances for people's amusement, these are not seen as bad for one main reason. It's jus<b> t a wo</b>man who did it, and really what harm cou<b> ld a w</b>oman do? We are caring, small, and weak. I think that this is wrong and not remotely okay, but that is how general society views these things. \nMore or less, wome<b> n ar</b>e sex objects to be pursued and used, not having many thoughts or desires of their own. That a guy got any s<b> ort of </b>sexual contact from one could only be a plus (as is thought when female teachers start \"relationships\" with their male middle school students); it is something that the boy is congratulated on and told to be happy about. He not only<b>  used </b>a woman for her purpose but got her to pursue him, early, no less. Now, I think that too is totally wrong and a terrible, traumatic violation compounded by a grave miscarriage of justice, but society at large still doesn't seem to think so. These reasons, not feminism, are<b>  why th</b>e sexual assault of males is so rarely talked about and so humiliating for the victims, particularly when perpetrated <b> by a g</b>irl/woman. \"That little thing took advantage of you? Ha! Come on, you know you wanted it. / Wow, she touched your junk?! You should be happy, man!\" Do you get what I'm saying? I hope so. :)",

The only thing that effects you is your mindless victim mentality, and your sense of entitlement.  Yout want \"equal\" pay?  Go get an education, and I don't mean business admin.\n\nBut considering you lack the intelligence to interpret the data in the wage gap statistics, I can see how you think you are oppressed by men.  So good luck in life, I hope you find a nice man to take care of you, you'll need it.",

Because it's actually proven by science that women have a harder work ethic than men, have a better memory, are better under pressure, outscore men on intelligence tests, have better communication skills, work better with customers, and are more likely to graduate college with a bachelors degree. Also if you think life is sooooo much better for us answer these questions. Do you have someone telling you what you should be able to do with your body? Do you have someone trying to take away healthcare and medicines that are a necessity for your health and overall happiness? Do you have to deal with harassment, intimidation, and possibly physical assault when you just go out for a god damn walk? Do you have to deal with a barrage of sexist or belittling comments anytime you do anything? Do you have to deal with people constantly telling you you're triggered or stupid or a bitch for standing up for your fundamental rights? Do you have to deal with every thing in regards to your own body being shamed or sexualized? Girls and women are taught from a very young <b> age </b>that no matter what we do it's not right. And yeah maybe in Syria or Saudi Arabia there are horrible atrocities committed against women, but every crime committed against a<b>  woman</b> is important and honestly you can go to take your bullshit opinion and shove it.",

Which is fucked up and wrong. Men deserve to have emotions and deserve to feel valid. That's not my point though, my point is that someone regardless male or female or whatever in between make a choice whether or not to end their life. I know plenty of people male and female who endure horrible environments and aren't dead. Your environment can have a<b>  mental</b> toll of course and should not be disregarded but no one is holding a gun to your head, no one is forcing you to jump. You have a sense of control. I was suicidal for years and was actually pretty damn close to dying but I have recovered because I chose to take my pain and experiences and make something out of it. No one has a choice whether or not they get hurt or experience pain in this world but you do have a choice what you do with that pain. Happiness is not something that's given or even taken from somewhere it's made. So no I don't think men are treated so horribly by society that they are forced to kill themselves I think they have individual things going on and they end up not being able to see another option",

I'd say feminism is absolutely wonderful and beneficial for places where women are abused, mutilated, sacrificed and unsupported by the legal justice system, but in places like America or Australia where the current problem is not political, but subjective it merely serves as a pendulum swinger that is a threat to the maintenance of <b> gender </b>equality. If we keep pushing for more rules for women where the rules are the same it will eventually lead to<b>  misandry</b> and will lead to a system where men are mistreated and have limited rights, basically a reverse repeat of history",

I can tell you how women were not really unprivileged as many people claim. You can see from the definition that it is about the woman's perspective of what privilege or equality is, and thus feminism is not about equality but about what a woman's perspective which they thought was denied to them. It is a movement based on misinterpreted history and forced blaming of natural laws onto a <b> gender </b>group.\nAlso, as the other person just said, ideologies are not words but actions. If you look at the ideology of Nazis, you'll probably not find anything hateful in it. But can you try to follow that ideal and call yourself a<b>  Nazi</b>? I bet you can't. Because of how the actions became the definition of the Nazism and not the written ideology or principle.",

Why is it that feminists are completely incapable of forming actual arguments? No one's afraid of women, numbnuts. Especially when all they do is whine and complain and play victims. Proving that women need special treatment and constant validation and pandering to. Acting like children isn't going to make anyone fear you, darling. Stop kidding yourself. You can refer to yourself as a 'strong and independent woman' all day long, but it won't make it true. You'll just be proving my point.\n\n\"leaving the kitchen\"\n\nWhere do you live? And I don't mean 'location', I mean 'time period'. The 50s? No one's telling women they can't work. The only women who don't work are women who don't want to work. That option is a female privilege. No man can just spend his day shopping and hanging out with his friends while his girlfriend works 60 hours a week. Check your privilege, maybe?\n\n\"fighting for themslves\"\n\nGetting triggered by literally everything and constantly complaining because you aren't always receiving special treatment is not 'fighting for yourselves'. It's just pathetic. Grow up.\n\n\"Is stopping 40 year<b>  old</b> men from raping 12 yea<b> r ol</b>d girls really that horrible to you?\"\n\nAnother straw man. And seemingly (unless I'm missing something here?) completely off topic.\n\nAlso, women are the majority of aggressors in domestic violence (70%) and are much more likely to kill their own children than men are.\n\n\"Or are you one of those men, and doesn't like that we're taking away your litt<b> le s</b>ex dolls?\"\n\nAgain, how is this relevant? Where did this come from? What's wrong with you?\n\nI've yet to see a feminist make an actual argument. They \"debate\" like school children. Always throwing a tantrum, calling names and making bigoted, baseless and nonsensical accusations.",

What makes those questions about dieting, fitness, and personal undergarments sexist is that they are asked to overwhelmingly more women than men even though those questions can apply to men regardless if it's sexist in nature. For example, a reporter asking a few actresses and few actors about how they get fit for a role isn't exactly sexist (assuming the nature of the question isn't), but multiple reporters or even just one only ask actresses about their fitness regime and only ask actors (especially those in the same move as actresses) meaningful questions like how they prepared for their role and their thoughts on it, then it's sexist. That's the complaint.",

No conscious<b>  misogyny</b> either - just a dinosaur who knows no better and made a fool of himself. \nWhat is less forgivable is the fact that he stubbornly insists he wasn't being sexist even to this day, and tries to blame her for derailing the interview because she doen't like him, rather than it being a reasonable response to moronic question. \nI was a child/teenager in his heyday, and I never much liked him or his show. \nAs repulsive as Parkinson's line of questioning is in this video, there was sadly 'a lot of it about' at the time.

So is more about how to respect others and not treat them like objects. Is all I believe most people expect. Not to be \"fit\" in a mold you put them because of preconceived ideas. You know Elizabeth, queen of England during Tudor period? She did a phenomenal job as a ruler, better than many of her male contemporaneous counterparts did. If she was totally stopped from ruling (as many men wanted at the time, because men = better in EVERYTHING or so they believed, and that is what most women fight against), who knows what the future of England would have been. Everybody should be free to pursue their interests and natural qualities. Is all that is fair.<b>  Nobody</b> is claiming men are worse or better in all senses. Is great, men should be strong, defend our country, etc. What is wrong with that? Most women are not denying your strength. Praising and supporting women achievements don't mean men also don't have their strong points. In general, is easier for men to put on muscles, but that also depends on specific genetics. Do you know they just found out a wealthy powerful viking warrior that was supposed to be a man, was actually found out to have been <b> a woma</b>n (through genetic testing)? So, women can be warriors too, maybe not all women are predisposed for that, but forcing women into roles because it has to be like that, is unfair and also damaging to society.",

The work remaining to be done is here and now, not in the past. We can't undo the past, but we can enact change in the present to build a better future. So get angry about what's going on around you, and be proactive about it. Don't waste time trying to view the past through a present lens, it's a waste of energy. Examine it by all means, learn from it, be educated. But attempting to change it to fit the ideals of the present is a fool's errand by any standard.",

You couldn't ask the man about his acting, his films, his wife, his shoes ANYTHING except his body?  And what did you expect him to do?

Actresses were asked about fitness and dieting far more often than actors who were asked more so about their skill as an actor and their opinions on the role. It's especially glaring in the Spider-Man interview panel where Emily stone was only asked about her fitness regime while her co-actors were asked questions that generally about their skill set or how they thought about the role or the movie and <b> nothing </b>about their fitness regime. As for the one on one interviews, it was basically the final straw or in the catwoman one, the interview focused way too much fitness",

Also, I strongly suspect that the title wasn't simply a reference to the eponymous MRA movement, but rather that it was named after the much broader <b> Red<b>  </b</b>>Pill phenomenon -- the sort of counter-zeitgeist that's been growing in response to the cultural inroads made by Third-Wave Feminism, identity politics, globalism, and other branches of Postmodern Cultural Marxism.\n\nAs for the particular MRA opinion you cited, I can understand why it might make you bristle a bit, but it does make some sense to me that eac<b> h gende</b>r (<b> or s</b>ex, if you prefer) might be designed to play some vital role, to serve some crucial function for the other (beyond procreation, I mean). In short, we're meant to complement one another. Otherwise, what would be the point of a binary species?  Why not have just evolved into a unary species that reproduces asexually (which, admittedly, would simplify things, but would also make existence a lot more boring)?

One aspect of it is that it encourages men to conceal their emotions when they are upset. There are various examples of how society does this such as how boys are frequently told from a fairly young <b> age </b>to stop being such a girl when they are crying. Also men and boys who get upset and they aren't mourning someone are told to stop being such a<b>  pussy</b>, and there is Britain's most widely read media source, The Daily Mail, occasionally publishing articles that criticise men who cry and says that they are weak, unattractive and pathetic. Many men take this on board and can either become aggressive when they are upset about something, or they simply bottle it up completely. At present the suicide rate for males in Western countries is 3-4x higher than females. This is directly linked. Despite this according to reports females experience suicidal thoughts at a higher rate. Many males with depression fail to admit it or to seek help. The members of the APA believe that it is a result of their upbringing and therefore agree with the belief that the way society encourages men to mask their emotions and the suicide rate are directly linked.",

We express ourselves less because we don't feel the need to. As for the suicide rate, factors that might be responsible for it include: losing 90% of all child custody battles, a higher rate of homelessness, divorce, occupying the majority of the worlds unpleasant manual labor jobs and a high domestic violence rate but next to no shelters to name a few. The suicide rate isn't just because of emotional repression. Labelling masculinity as \"toxic\" is an incredibly stupid thing to do. Without masculinity we would all be swinging from trees flinging shit at each other. Masculinity is good for men but it needs to be taught from one man to another without the intervention of women. Do I think men have a place to comment on femininity? No! I know <b> nothing </b>about femininity and womanhood so it's hardly my place to comment on it. So why is it acceptable for women to insult masculinity and label it \"toxic\"? The answer is that it's not and masculinity needs to be left to men. Just like womanhood needs to be left to women.",

In Eastern cultures it is encouraged that you show a balance of positive and negative emotions whereas in Western cultures it is encouraged for people to mainly express positive emotions. Also globally the Male suicide rate is 1.8x higher than females however in Western countries it is 3-4 times higher.

I think it can be agreed upon that suicide is bad and that failing to seek help when experiencing suicidal thoughts is bad that's why the suppression of emotions is deemed toxic due to the number of deaths it has resulted in. People in other cultures have just as much reason to be upset as those in other cultures, they are more likely to live in poverty, have family members die of disease and males in those societies often carry a bigger burden when it comes to supporting their families. Now a good country to use as an example of difference in the suicide rate is China since approximately 1 billion people live there.

What I mean by that is that it is proven that men choose methods of suicide that are more effective EG: hanging. I'm not going to deny that emotional repression and lack of communication are reasons for the high male suicide rate but they're not the only reason. And they're not attributable to \"toxic masculinity\". I need to say though Roxane that I am incredibly impressed.

Now your original point was that the higher male suicide rate is as a result of toxic masculinity discouraging men from communicating about their feelings. I've already gone through so many alternative points that I don't think I need to again. So instead I will ask you why the male suicide rate is highest in the western world? In Europe in particular. The west is the most progressive and has taken great strides to dismantle \"toxic masculinity\" which as you say hurts men. So it stands to reason that all of this progressiveness in getting rid of such a harmful thing as toxic masculinity would have helped cut down the high male suicide rate. Right? So why is it that the progressive west still suffers the most from male suicide? Could it be that maybe toxic masculinity isn't responsible and perhaps doesn't even exist? Could it be that the variety of other factors might play a part? Since we've begun dismantling those oppressive <b> gender </b>roles everything should have been fine and everyone happy and fulfilled and independent. So why aren't our men happy? Actually why aren't our women happy? If I recall correctly female happiness is at an all time low... in such a progressive area of the world why aren't we all happier?",

They still committed suicide. If anything, it shows that seeking help doesn't work. Also, women attempt suicide at higher rates than men. Men just succeed more often because of the methods they choose. Women have no problems expressing their emotions and they try to kill themselves more. Knowing that, what makes you think that men expressing more emotions will help reduce the amount of male suicide? Your take on men and emotions is flawed. Men are not taught to not express emotions. They are taught that there is a time a place to do it. The main reasons why boys are told to stop crying are usually either because the thing their crying about is stupid and not worth crying over. For example, falling off your bike and scraping your knee. Or because others may need to rely on them in a future bad situation. For example, a guy with his girlfriend are walking down the street at night when someone holds them at gunpoint. Crying from fear isn't going to help in that situation. I would really like to see your evidence that a guy mourning someone would be called a<b>  pussy</b>. Yes, a large number of males and females have potential triggers. Why is it that you can only be bothered to mention some of the female's triggers in your post and none of the males? Are there no dark sides of feminism? Do you believe people should steer clear of feminism because of them as well?",

Sexim is to belive that a person women is inferior due to her <b> gender,</b> and impose stereotypes on men and women.\nSo saying she \"do you think you can ever beat a man\", is sexist. To say that she is only the best sports women which is seen as an inferior category when she is the best tennis player is false and sexist. Also one time they said this newbie teenis player was the first person to win a certain award when she won it twice already.\n\nIt's sexist to think it's her fault for her clothes getting messed up as you can't predict that situation and so<b>  nothing</b> can be done about it, it's called an \"accident/malfunction\". He is being sexist implying that it's her fault that people took pictures of it an sold it, when literally the person taking pictures is in control of the camera.",

                    "commentText": "Serena Williams in absolutely NOT one of the best athlete's ever. She is basically a man so has dominated femaile tennis which is a joke anyway. But here is a little known story;\n\nHow to... beat both Williams sisters in one afternoon\n\nKarsten Braasch is the German tennis player who did just that in 1998\u00a0\n\nSunday 2 September 2001\nObserver Sport Monthly\u00a0\n\nIt was the 1998 Australian Open and the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, had seen some of the male players practising. On the basis of what they saw, they were convinced that they could beat a man ranked around 200 in the world and wanted to set up a game. At the time I was ranked 203 so the men's tour manager mentioned the possibility of a challenge to me, thinking that I was the perfect candidate. I didn't take much persuading, it seemed like a fun thing to do.\n\nMy advice if you're ever in a position to play a match of this nature is be patient - don't be annoyed or surprised if your match against the Williams sisters is cancelled, as they both have very busy schedules. My game against them had to be re-organised at least a couple of times.\n\nPreparation is crucial. Remember that a game like this is light-hearted - taking it too seriously would be a mistake. My training regime consisted of a leisurely round of golf in the morning followed by a couple of shandies. I turned up on court feeling suitably laid-back.\n\nMy first game of the afternoon, just a one-set match, was against Serena. A hint: try and play your match somewhere quiet, where you're not going to be pestered by big crowds or lots of press - we were out on one of the back courts at Melbourne Park, No 17 I think it was. I felt so relaxed that I didn't even warm up properly. We started playing and I raced into a 5-0 lead.\n\nAt this point Venus turned up to watch. She had just finished a press conference after a quarter-final loss against Lindsey Davenport. In the end I won my game against Serena 6-1 but by the time we were at the net shaking hands, Venus was on court, ready to have a go against me as well. The game against Venus was very similar. I ended up winning 6-2.\n\nBoth sisters are great tennis players and hit the ball extremely well. However, if you've been playing on the men's tour there are certain shots you can play that are going to put them in difficulty. Try and put a lot spin on the ball - I was hitting the ball with a degree of spin they don't face week-in, week-out. Another key is to chase down every shot. In our match, they were putting shots into the corners that on the women's tour would be winners but I was able to return them.\n\nIn the end I won, but neither myself, nor Venus or Serena took the game too seriously - we were just having a bit of fun.\n\nApparently, after the game, Serena and Venus immediately told the press they wanted to challenge a male player again. This time they revised the ranking of the man they wanted to face, to 350 in the world. I informed the journalist who told me this that in the next week I was set to lose a lot of ATP points and drop down to 350 in the rankings. I told him that if Venus and Serena waited just one week they could challenge me all over again!\n\nThat never came about, but when I saw Venus a few months later at the French Open she came up to me with a big smile on her face and said, 'You know that thing in Australia - it never happened!'",

Billions of women have jobs, many of them have regular jobs that require more hours and effort than an actress. The fact an actress can work and have a personal life shouldn't be surprising.",

The real problem are the women who don't ask men about their <b> sex </b>lives, dick sizes or anything. But you still smile while watching shirtless men. I have so much respect for both women and men but do we have to be so pissed of about the things that are natural.\n\nAriana Grande is such a whiner. Those guys were just asking her a silly question. You don't have to be dead serious. There has been lots of<b>  dumb</b> question but only those ones who ask women get attention. Just answer the stupid question, Ari! Or maybe you cannot choose because you need them both like obsessed? You need also Nicki Minaj and the hype you have around you. I have no problems about Taylor Swift or Rihanna because they  don't act like complete sluts with some fake feminism around them. Ari, you sing abou<b> t se</b>x all the time but you cannot handle the consequences when some of your listeners tries to ask you for date! It is terrible if someone asks you for date in the streets! You have to write a letter about \"sexist men\". Fuck off! Women are all the time saying that it is men's responsible to make the first move while you can enjoy life! I am glad there are other kind of women who don't think men as entertainers. You don't have to throw shit on everyone who tries to make a connection with you. BOTH men and women a<b> re sexu</b>al, deal with it! I don't have trouble when Selena Gomez or Nicki MInaj sings ab<b> out </b>sex but your hypocrite opinions are the worst, Ariana! Your comments are very similar - maybe you are just a robot!!!\n\nI give very much respect for women and men who actually are for equality and not some fake shit feminism. Originally feminism was about women getting right to vote. Now it is about clothing and make-up. Like somebody would care!",

In all honesty I was a tad <b> chubby </b>at10 , then got into sports and ate a lot of food for energy.

Then I toned up at like 18.  I did not change my regime or anything just did sports i liked and ate to have energy to do it.  \n\nYour body is changing so fast and it's the one time in your life where weight gain is actually technically GOOD for you.  \n\nDieting is dangerous at that point in your life unless your actually overweight.  That of course is another issue.  But like for the most part weight gain goes to good places before like 18.  \n\nAt that point your body needs to build up some<b>  fat</b>.  At the same time it's always important to eat high energy foods so that you FEEL like being active.  \n\nDon't diet at under 18 unless your health problem is actually weight.   Eat high energy and take up some fun activity.  Biking, rock climbing, soccer, skating, basketball, chasing the neighborhood kids off your lawn.  Your body will do the rest for you.",

That they are born that way? No darling, they tend to focus on those things because this culture... this MALE dominated (though perhaps not for much longer) culture... bombards their minds through attitude and advertising with the idea that they HAVE to care about that stuff or they will be shunned, overlooked, made fun of, ignored, unloved, and unworthy. Males are acceptable as themselves, how they are and who they are, a great deal more; females are not. Between males salivating over overly sexualized representation of females,  multi-billion dollar industries relying on keeping females (especially young, impressionable females) buying their products through the use of highly manipulative and harmful advertising, and the constant perpetuation of idiotic sexist ideology around every corner of a girls life, of COURSE they tend to care about these things. Why is it boys are \"okay with being <b> fat </b>and out of shape\", why is it \"they don't care\"??? Because they aren't targeted by everything around them TO care. And even that's changing. Even males are being targeted by the market place to associate their self-worth with the superficial. It's been that way for awhile and it's getting worse, but it hasn't gotten as bad for them YET. But thank you for proving the point at hand, although I'm certain that's not what you intended.",
