Unless we are talking about low skill minimum wage work (fast food, restaurant waiter, retail worker), marketing work, or media \"like those radio djs, and certain TV presenters) then just about everything else, an older worker is way more valued over a younger worker. Just look at how those older workers were able to find jobs right away because of all that experience they got. Younger workers need to be able to build more hands on experience, especially since we are moving towards a time where the youth of today will have LESS hands on experience and far more educational experience compared to previous generations. Things that were seen as jobs 40 years ago, are now seen as lifelong careers today. Most of these occupations don't pay much more than minimum wage, yet older workers expect younger workers work there for decades?!",

You can also do things on the side and not call it a business to avoid taxes, then be able to get unemployment at the same time. You don't have to work a union job. You could easily go somewhere else and call your boss his majesty and have to do everything he says to keep it. Been there done that with over 20 companies, and I don't miss it.",
