        "postText": " Multidisciplinary artist and TED Fellow Paul Rucker is unstitching the legacy of systemic racism in the United States. A collector of artifacts connected to the history of slavery -- from branding irons and shackles to postcards depicting lynchings -- Rucker couldn't find an undamaged Ku Klux Klan robe for his collection, so he began making his own. The result: striking garments in non-traditional fabrics like kente cloth, camouflage and silk that confront the normalization of systemic racism in the US. 'If we as a people collectively look at these objects and realize that they are part of our history, we can find a way to where they have no more power over us,' Rucker says.

It is deeply hurtful when people believe such terrible lies. I am REALLY upset. I worked hard and behaved well to build a life out of hardship, a single parent's kid and I did it to be reduced to THIS? EVERYBODY let it happen. I now have nightmares that racists will chemically <b> dumb </b>me down to the<b>  racist</b> stereotype they want me to be and frame me for crimes I did not commit. My experience has proved to me that you can be angelic and live a perfect life but it won't protect you from being dumbed down and framed as a disgustin<b> g racis</b>t stereotype if you a<b> re bla</b>ck. We are not safe. Equality is a LIE.",

            "commentText": "Racism will never go away if we continue to say the problem still exists. \"Just accept it and be aware\" is something I get told all the time about white privilege. But what does that accomplish? Privilege isn't something I do, and being aware of it doesn't allow me to change my actions so I don't \"do\" privilege anymore. I need to make three points. First, I've heard people say that <b> black </b>people can't be<b>  racist</b>, because they're the minority or the victims, and that simply isn't correct. Anyone, anyone can behave in <b> a racis</b>t manner. It is an act that requires two people only, and all it takes is for one of these people to treat the other differently because of the<b> ir ra</b>ce to have behaved i<b> n a rac</b>ist manner. Second. The term people of color is the concept of separate but equal in disguise. \"As a person of color...\" If you say this, why are you celebrated? Because you're a minority? Like the color of your skin gives you the right to have a more valuable opinion or insight? You might have experiences that others can't relate to, but so does a white person. No one deserves special treatment because of t<b> heir </b>race. If I said \"as a white person...\" and expected people to listen to me and respect me because of that, I'd be la<b> beled r</b>acist. The term people of color creates a split of everyone in the world between \"white people\" and \"the rest of the world\". And it creates the idea that a person of color should be celebrated while a white person deserves no celebration. It is a direct mirror of<b>  early </b>racism in the states. One \"racial group\" is better than another is what it says. Let's look at the above defini<b> tion of</b> racism. Wow, <b> \"POC\" i</b>s racist! And <b> somethi</b>ng racist w<b> on't so</b>lve racism. Third, privilege<b>  itself </b>has nothin<b> g to </b>do with race. Privilege is the phenomenon that occurs in a society when one individual's way of life, i.e. their language, customs, etc. are close to the \"standard\" way of life in that society. The closer your life is to that standard, the more privilege you have. Standard ways of life are normal. These standards are what unify societies. Don't beli<b> eve me? </b>In an African village with a strong identity and culture, a member of that tribe who speaks the language is privileged. If I went there, I would not have privilege, because I do not speak the language and I do not understand the culture. I will face a natural struggle to fit in. So the question becomes, how do you tell if someone's life is close to the standard? In America, the country was founded by white people who had an established culture. This culture became the \"American\" culture historically, and its the culture America operates on still today, for reasons I will explain shortly. In the past, the easiest way to know was to look at the appearance of the person. Back then you cou<b> ld ea</b>sily tell race and economic status based on appearan<b> ce. T</b>his is how race became involved. Back then it wasn't easy to travel long distances, meaning if you didn't look white, you weren't a \"local tribesman\" of America, and so you had less privilege. Now back then people actively sought out less privileged individuals to take advantage of them. Everyone getting mad about white privilege today act like that's what white people still do, which also is incorrect. It's all subconscious now, and like I said simply calling it out won't change it. Here's what will. Privilege won't ever go away. It's a natural phenomenon. What you can do is change the variables. You can change the standard which life is compared to and you can change the things used to assume, and as it is subconscious and unavoidable, assuming will occur. The standard way of life in America has remained unchanged because to change the standard way of life is to change the values of the society, something that can't be done without unity. When America was founded, there was unity among the colonies, the states. Today, America is divided on the racial issue (Poc vs. White). Because of this, those values haven't changed. Also, the assuming factors are still racial, a broken (and bad) model as America has become very diverse, with Americans coming from everywhere and extremely diverse looking, and thi<b> s model</b> leads to racism. What do we do? Based on the goal of ra<b> cial eq</b>uality and gender equality and in general equality, we need to first unify ourselves. Create an American identity that is updated. America is not white people. America is diverse. Stop hating America. Create an <b> American ide</b>ntity. Nationalism. Create a value we can be proud of. A<b> nd th</b>en, stop using race to decide who is or is not American. If we can do this, the privilege goes back to where it should be, between domestic and foreign. You all have to accept that privilege is natural. It's just in the wrong place and was used for the wrong reasons. Pr<b> ivilege</b> in which one nation is not privileged in another is completely normal, and not at all bad. In this context it creates pride. Onc<b> e this </b>change occurs, racism can begin to heal and go away. This man simply pointed it out. It takes more<b>  than t</b>hat to demolish racist undertones in our country. Final thought: yes I said domestic vs. foreig<b> n. That</b> doesn't mean be racist to foreigners. It means you need to accept that foreigners will be less privileged in your country and to ease that struggle rather than try to pretend the struggle doesn't exist or try to make someone else struggle instead. And as well, it's okay to have American pr<b> ide. It</b> doesn't make you racist or anti-immigration. If you are proud of your country, you should want people to join in. That being said, naturalization is necessary. Immigrate legally. Don't help people immigrate illegally, but rather try to change naturalization laws so they don't have to immigrate illegally. But I digress. Long sto<b> ry shor</b>t, the issue about racism is disguised and the solution blocked by a wild goo<b> se chas</b>e of c<b> alling </b>people r<b> acist, </b>using racism to fight racism, an<b> d bia</b>sed media and attention. Race does<b> n't m</b>atter.<b>  You ca</b>n't use your race to end racism and you can't use your privilege to fight privilege. Accept that, and accept that goose chase battles are a waste of time. I'm fighting the real battle. What battle will you fight? Remember the saying \"we stand United. We'll never be divided\"? We is America. Not one minority group, not all pocs against white people. We the people. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",

Its no wonder the US is slipping fast, the sheer ignorance in the comments alone shows that Americans lack critical thinking skills. No one is telling any white person to feel guilt, but all you ignorant folks hear is \"whites are <b> racist,</b> or the white man is bad\". The lack of comprehension on this topic by white people is amazing, and sad. The end of the US dominance in this world cant come quick enough, and it will be well deserved, only because American citizens lack the critical thinking skills that will be needed in the New World. Hold onto your MAGA idealism and watch the rest of the world pass you by and when it happens. Just tell your children\" well we had MAGA led by a conman who promised the world to us, but  secretly he and his buddies were stealing from us\" .",

Europe is not going to be the monolithic societies that they once were in the last century. Jews are going to be at the center of that. It's a huge transformation for Europe to make. They are now going into a multicultural mode, and Jews will be resented because of our leading role. But without that leading role, and without that transformation, Europe will not survive.\" -- Barbara Lerner Spectre, founding director of Paideia, the European Institute for Jewish Studies in Sweden\r\n\r\nIsrael Cohen 1912 'We must realize that our party's most powerful weapon is RACIAL TENSION. By propounding into the consciousness of the DARK races, that for centuries they have been oppressed by Whites, we can mold them to the program of the <b> Communist </b>Party. In America, we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the<b>  Negro</b> minority against the Whites, we will endeavor to instill in the Whites, a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negros. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the PROFESSIONS, and in the world of SPORTS and ENTERTAINMENT. With this prestige, th<b> e Negr</b>o will be able to INTER-MARRY with the Whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause. .' AUTHOR \u2013 Israel Cohen(Zionist<b>  \u2014 Communi</b>st \u2014 Internationalist) 'A Racial Program for the Twentieth Century' >Published in 1912,. On June 17, 1957, Vol. 103 p. 8559, the above passage was read into the United States Congressional Record by Rep. Thomas G. Abernathy  [LINK] \r\n \r\nMingling of races \u2013 a targeted strategy of the New World Order\r\n\r\nThomas Barnett: The Europeans should be a light brown mi<b> xed r</b>ace with an IQ of 90 \r\n\r\nIn his books The Pentagon's New Map. War and Peace in the Twenty-first Century (G. P. Putnam's Sons, 2004, ISBN 0399151753) and Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating (G. P. Putnam's Sons, 2005, ISBN 0399153128) Thomas P. M. Barnett declares that all who stand against Miscegenation and Multi-Culturalism are of immoral character and not in tune with current times. And that all who resist Globalization must be purged.\r\n\r\nvice president of the EU, top of the united nations official, Frans Timmermans said \"no homogeneous population will be allowed to exist anywhere in the world\". UN special representative for migration, Peter Sutherland said \"EU should do its best to undermine homogeneity\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Israel deports or cast<b> rate b</b>lack Coptic Jews in Israel (cause they aren't the right colour Jews,  according to the beige Jews like satanyahy) and they refuse to take any Muslim refugees cause as they say \" letting in a large group of Muslims would be detrimental to the Jewish culture \"  so no Israel is not a multi culti jewtopia - it's an etnho state who treats all non Jews aka goys as second class citizens! FACT !! And we're all tired of the hypocrisy of this retarded tribe who demand that we open our countries cause muh holocaust or some other retarded excuses, while at the same time refusing to do so themselves. I don't think there's ever been a people who suck at selfcritisism and intro spection as much as this tribe , the level of dobbelt standards are just mind-blowing!!",

It's like winning the lottery and getting upset anytime someone reminds you about it...oh that actually kinda makes sense does it? I think I figured out a logical basis for why this might upset so many people. I've done the impossible! Now the solution is to go to your schools and implement education that teaches kids to be okay with talking about things they won but maybe haven't earned. I'm honestly not making fun of anyone here, we all have parallels to this in our lives we can relate to. And we should all be able to see why it makes us feel uncomfy and causes anger. If you get a house but didn't earn it, and someone talks about how the proces they went through to get their house.....it would piss you off, no? There are countless readily thinkable examples  you could come up with here.",

Yes, the slave trade was a capitalistic venture, but it wasn't the WHOLE basis of capitalism in this country, many years ago. Capitalism in and of itself is merely the act of trading something of value for something else of equivalent value.

But I'm interested in your reply too! Like you said your experiences are real as well. While the group of people you met while working within your career probably represent a small group as well,  its always been a challenge for me to really recognize ALL the people that something like <b> racism </b>and other forms of discrimination could effect.  Systematic<b>  racism</b> has always seemed like a really big topic that encompassed a lot of random nuanced aspects that I, even as <b> a blac</b>k male, didn't always realize.  And like the comment stated, people, have experiences where they feel like a system didn't affect them or they created their own path in life and where they are is the result of their hard work or lack of. I've just always wanted to understand even in my own way despite <b> my ra</b>ce or experiences because what I learned and have accepted is its ok to hear and believe in others people experiences. So questions I had or would pose about this response is what claims have \"they\" made and why are or aren't viable? What are they asking for or to happen in regards to submitting to their request? And knowing the experiences of these men and considering them to be true, at what point or amount of people would any group need for their feelings or opinions to be seriously considered as valid in a social context? By that, I guess I mean for people to be like \"oh yea there's definitely something to consider.\"",

We all know about lynching and the KKK. We all know it's bad, and have since before I was born. Just like we all know about the Holocaust. It is NOT alive and well today. We do NOT live in a white supremacist country, and there is no more \"systemic\" <b> racism.</b> There is no legal segregation (in fact there was mandatory integration in my public schools). You were never a slave. No living white person today has ever owned a slave or lynched anyone. Police kill twice as many whites as blacks. The most likely people to get shot by the police are people who commit crimes, especially violent crimes, and then resist arrest.\n\nDo we blame Germans born after the Holocaust for the extermination camps? No. Why not? Because we know they had<b>  nothing</b> to do with it. Wouldn't it be ridiculous to blame some German child born yesterday for the Holocaust? Is there a statute of limitations on guilt at birth?\n\nSo, again, great to learn about the past, but to pretend things haven't changed and to brand innocent white people with white supremacy and crimes they never committed in the slightest is shading into scapegoating and demonizing people based o<b> n rac</b>e.\n\nAre you responsible for HIroshima? You're American, aren't you. Are you responsible for the war on Iraq? Well, you're an American. Are you responsible for all  the crimes men have committed against women, or adults have committed against children? Ridiculous, you say? It's just as ridiculous to blame average white people for slavery as for steali<b> ng Indi</b>an land or the Boston Tea Party. It's as accurate as blaming Jews or Romans today for crucifying Christ.\n\nI'd probably be more interested in your actual experience<b>  of rac</b>ism in you life, as well as your experience of<b>  non-ra</b>cism (including have an art career and your art shown in white-owned galleries and museums). \n\nWe should never forget the lessons of slavery, but one of those lessons is<b>  that n</b>obody is guilty or morally inferior based on their biology at birth. Learn that lesson well.",

Many are completely ignoring the ideas put forth in this video and stating that the speaker did not 'explain' systemic <b> racism.</b> You realize that's part of the problem, right? That it's difficult to point it out? He emphasized how subtlety of systemic<b>  racism</b> in America makes it such a difficult battle. It seems a handful of you chose to ignore that. I think a lot of people's misunderstanding of 'systemi<b> c racis</b>m' comes from phraseology. When one refers to 'system<b> ic raci</b>sm,' one isn't talking about explicit government-sanctioned discrimination or some obvious act like that. 'Systemic' refers more to how many aspects of our society have underlying elements governed<b>  by rac</b>ism, especially our economy. I was really glad he emphasized how he American economic system was largely impacted by the practice of chattel slavery. Slavery was essentially one of the most formative aspects of the early United States, and everything from its practice to its abolition affected discrimination against blacks. Many are calling this 'race-baiting' but I see no semblance of that here to be perfectly honest. He is not attempting to stir up sentiment against others. Nowhere does he imply that one group of people are the problem and we need to be the solution. He is talking about symbols and systems, but many of you are treating it like he's attacking you directly, which is quite telling.",

Women commit petty violence and domestic abuse at about the same rate as men. It is at the extremes where men tend to outnumber women. It is the same with IQ as well, with women tending to crowd to the center of the curve, but rarely at the edges, whereas men tend far more likely to skew toward either extreme. The psychological studies of male and female behavior and crime statistics support this.",

In fact, the initial settlements by virtually every<b>  ethnic</b> group tends to be dirt poor. A good example of this is Chinese immigration during the California gold rush; they were manual laborers who literally built railroads with hand tools. Yet violent crime is lower in Chinese communities compared to national averages wherever they go in the West, and there is no evidence of high rates of crime amongst poor east asian communities in the west. The same goes fo<b> r India</b>n communities, but not for Pakistani communities. Wanna know why? Culture, not poverty. Indians and Pakistanis are ethnically similar, but culturally different, particularly with religion, and that makes all the difference.\n\nSo to conclude, I agree that we need to tackle the problem at its source, but the source is not poverty. In fact, poverty is often another consequence of the source, which is culture.

I can accept that Emmett Till, being in the part of the country that he was and the incident he was involved in, did get killed by two racists, and the killers were willfully acquitted by a jury that would rather see them go free, despite the evidence. In fact, the two men later admitted to doing it in a magazine interview, but could not stand double jeopardy. In my opinion that was a miscarriage of justice that did happen, but those are the cases that make national news because they are so extreme. I would not say that is how the American legal and court system works frequently and as a rule.

                    "commentText": "Jarful of Love Psychological literature suggests a slight difference between male and female agressivity. At least in western societies. The magnitude of this effect is 60 40. Meaning if you were to see a man and a <b> woman </b>and were to guess at the man being more agressive you'd be right 60% of the time. Criminals however aren't the average person, they are the extremes at the agressive end of the distribution. And while both distributions are normally distributed, the mens one is a bit more to the right. The problem here is that a slight effect at the middle will make a huge effect at the ends of the distribution. The principle is called paredo principle. \n\nAs for<b>  black</b> people. Hmm, yes there might be some effect o<b> f racis</b>m. However, since there are no laws anymore that prefer white people ov<b> er bla</b>ck people, i am not confident that's the only reas<b> on. Bl</b>ack people tend to come from a lower socioeconomic background, which, in western cultures of these times is associated with worse education, and a lack of belief in government. Therefore bam: perfect reason<b>  why b</b>lack people, who are on average worse off than white people would appear to be more criminal than others. Mind you: white people of low SES should be just as criminal, as would latinos or asians. However, since asians and whites normally have a good SES, they tend to be less criminal.\n\nAnd that's without accusing youth culture of antieducation or gangsta culture. These might become relevant if my factors aren't enough. \nMind you: i am from Essen in germany. The only thing that predicts crime and sucess is the area you live in. However your heritage or skincolor predicts where you are more likely to live, since especially immigrants like cheaper quarters. And in a bad area, only few people can thrive,no matter the color of their skin.",

You never, not even for a millisecond, would want to understand nor learn this topic. Which is <b> weird </b>considering TED is the embodiment of learning and sharing experiences through the eyes of everyday people, yet you all seem to have a problem with this topic. You would rather listen to every other social issue expect this one. You think its a waste time and space for the channel. Even this comment will not get through your thick skull. You will never comprehend what you're reading or what you just watched cause you won't acknowledge the simple fact that slavery indeed happened and have continuous ripple effects in our day to day lives. You much rather savor the world wars, George Washington, and the Holocaust. Speaking of the holocaust, i never see comments under any holocaust-related video to 'stop living in the past'. Matter of fact. You probably think the holocaust was worse than slavery, though I'm not comparing these two horrific moments in history. You much rather show your emotions and learning towards the holocaust than to slavery any day. But that's because for decades, we've been taught to overlook and dehumanize the disgusting enslavement of<b>  black</b> people. In schools, lessons on slavery were one paragraph, no less than two pages. And as shown in the video, post cards of disturbing lynches were actually sent to people. All in all, history of slavery is indifferent to many people in the United States cause they don't even consider it as their own history. It's something in the past with very little elaboration and deals with onl<b> y Blac</b>k Americans. And the reasons you comment 'to stop playing victim' actually stems from slavery for reasons just explained. Meaning that we're ALL attached to slavery and that we ALL STILL DEAL WITH THE AFTERMATH TODAY. But to whom it may concern, you will probably comment something like 'this don't even make sense' and it will never make sense as long as your comfortable with ignorance.",

Either way. multiculturalism  as a social experiment has been shown and admitted to being a complete and utter failure in every case where it has been attempted on a grand scale such as Europe and The US. Acceptance of every other culture into mixed societies has failed at every level and as such, forced integration has been proven to not work.

A failure to adapt to their new surroundings. A failure to learn the native language. A failure to adapt to their politics, religions, music, clothing etc... It has led to simply creating more of a segregated society than existed before attempting to force Multiculturalism down everybody's throat.  The fact is that there are huge differences between cultures and trying to force their integration has only led to further issues which too many of the supporters of multiculturalism's  have now labeled<b>  as Rac</b>ism.

Infact every-time there is some kind of reparation or rights given back it prompts massive protest by the whites lol.\n\nIsn't that messed up? Because we abused them in the past we now feel entitled to abuse them in the present. We refuse to give them the government support we provide for ourselves, and in general protest if we do anything for them that we do for ourselves. We are sorry we took their land and give them some land back to live on with no or little taxes, and then we deny them every right our society gives its citizens. But we expect them to live in and abide by this very same society. I mean....that's just cruel. It would be less cruel to just make them integrate into our society. At least THAT way we wouldn't have them as second class citizens.\n\nI mean if someone took ur house from you. Said sorry years later and gave you the backyard and shed back to live in and said you don't have to pay taxes. Would that be an act of kindness? It's kinda debatable but many would say yes, as its an improvement. But then you learned they cutoff ur water and heat and electricity and refuse to allow you to hoook it up to your shed. So now you gotta live in this society and go to the grocery store  lookin like a hobo...showing off ur tax free card getting scoffs from everyone around you. Like you are some freeloader and living off THEIR hard work or something. \nTHAT\"S MESSED UP!",

They were supposed to give land to anybody who wanted to settle, but discrimination made it much harder for blacks. Because if that, they couldn't build farms as easily nor build although nearly as easy to pass down. This they often had to stay on the very plantations they were supposed to be free from. With less wealth to pass down, future generations didn't have time and resources for formal education and travel to further economically mobilize upward. Each generation since then might have had some get lucky and come across chances for wealth, but most were kept to the jobs the middle and upper class didn't want....and that continues today.",

Even when \"African-Americans\" were trying to get equal treatment back in the day, they also fought for poor White Americans to be treated better too. In fact, some \"Whites\" were seen as inferior, and stupid, to other \"Whites\". This alone shows why it's entirely stupid to judge purely based on whether someone is \"White\" or not when a \"White\" person from X country saw a \"White\" from Z country as utterly inferior and not worth living.\n\nAlso, may I ask why do Asians, a minority group that was historically treated poorly in the US and initially all worked jobs no one wanted, is currently dominating even White Americans for average income? Why did they go from working jobs no one wants, to being<b>  doctors</b>, dentists, programmers, etc? They were not given the head starts, the financial assistance, or the free jobs/education while being under qualified like \"African-Americans\" were, but yet, they succeed. Why is that?\n\nHere's why. Asians have a completely different culture and mindset than every other group in the world. They have very high expectations from their peers and family, and on an individual level, they actually want to be independent and succeed. They are also very likely to mix with other \"races\" when it comes to friendships or relationships compared to \"African-Americans\".\n\nJust take one look at the \"African-American\" culture, look at how successful \"African-Americans\" are bullied simply for pointing out the issue is a cultural one.",

With the title being what it is and AS LONG as it is, the length of discussion wasn't what i was expecting. But then I realized what TED first labelled him as \"Multidisciplinary *Artist*.\" After discussing his artifacts collection and what led him to creating the robes, it clicked. \"oh. this is an art gallery except..\" Robe 1, Robe 2, Robe 3 fabrics have a purpose because they each are criticize society. .. This wasn't about how people can overcome en masse symbols and how to destroy their power but how one man created an art piece, which left him empowered. To best get the gist of what the title implies, look into CoOping symbols and Mel Brook's use of KKK \"Have a Nice Day\" Robes in BLAZING SADDLES.",

When the slaves were chained in the bowels of those ships it was typically for six weeks minimum!! Probably not an hour after leaving port, the slaves, I'm sure started getting seasick then there was urinating and defecation and some women probably had two  menstruation cycle's and on top of that I'm sure there was a lot of vomiting while making this trip!! no one can even begin to imagine the vile stench that those people had to endore for the whole trip!!! Being a white man I am ashamed of my ancestors and for what they did to the Blackman!! And a vast majority of your slave owners and slave traders were supposed  Christians!! Doesn't make a very good case for Christianity does it!?",

A protest vote is voting for the opponent just to spite the other candidate, I voted Trump because I 100% support his policies.  I was <b> dumb </b>out of high school in 2008 and had liberal ideologies and voted for Obama.  Then I got thrown into the real world and had to grow up and saw what a load of BS Obama had offered and failed to deliver on, and in the time of his presidency how detached from reality the Democratic party had become.   Becoming an adult brought about my conservatism, albeit I still have a couple left leaning ideals. So many former democrats saw what a sham and how detached from reality the Democratic party had become and just left.

                    "commentText": "Apparently, the TED community is full of hateful people. Also, the share of <b> racist </b>hateful people is exaggerated by bots and people having alt-accounts to upvote and answer to their own comments. I'm almost sure this \"Big Willie\" guy is one of those. His comments get lots of upvotes suspiciously fast and the first few answers are always very similar and only a few minutes apart. That's tricking the YouTube algorithm basics. His views also seem to always align with the opposite of what the speaker says. (I also noticed the same accounts replying to each other over and over again on every video.)\nI don't want to put it all on trolls and some criticism is very correct about TED, although IMO they have become better again but still, the proportion of hateful comments and dislikes is suspicious. There are probably also a lot of people that truly believe in what they write but in my experience, many simply jump on the bandwagon and if you ask them a concrete question, they can't answer. TED is an easy target nowadays but going back to science only is also no solution. The fact that this hate-machinery exists is the reason TED can't stop making these videos, we need the discourse even if it is disrupted regularly, without it there will be no progress.\nAnother trend is the awful reductionism that seems to spread. Whenever anyone makes a point, people on the internet assume that this is everything that this person is and that the person claims that their problem is the only one worth working on. But that's not true (most of the time). Life is complex, there is a seemingly infinite multitude of problems and just because somebody says that one problem is worth working on, doesn't mean they claim that all other problems are not. It is the same as the SpaceX argument: \"Why do you waste all that money and work on space exploration when there are so much more pressing issues on earth.\" I think the response was something like this: \"There are so many companies focusing on earth-problems, what's wrong when one company works on space-problems?\"\nAnd that is exactly the point. Multiple things can be important at the same time and have to be worked on at the same time. Reductionism makes me sick.\nJust look at this argument a few comments up:\n\"The Democrats founded the KKK\" (which had<b>  nothing</b> to do with the actual argument of the comment, which was that people mostly segregate themselves)\n-\"Yes but since then there has been a major shift in the parties politics\"\n\"There has been no party shift because Hillary Clinton called somebody her \"friend and mentor\" that was a KKK member.\"\nAm I insane or is this not even an argument? People denying complexity are horrible to discuss with...\nSorry for the wall of text but I'm just frustrated with this.",

                    "commentText": "Level Joe \nHumor me, read this story in full:\n\nGeorge Wallace, the former Democratic govorner of Alabma, ran for President 4 times. \n\nHe was the segregationist that cheered 'segregation now, segregation tommorow, segregation forever.'\nHe did this all under the banner of 'States Rights'.\nKeep that in mind.\n\nKeep in mind that LBJ signed the civil rights act in 1964. Sure, LBJ had some <b> old </b>timey<b>  racism</b>, but it was a good thing he signed this law.\n\nWallace hated the civil rights act. He first ran for President in 1964 but lost the democratic primary but got an electoral vote if I recall correctly.\nIn 1968 he ran as an independent and won 5 southern states.\nHe ran again in 1972 and 1976, losing.\n\nRichard Nixon, president from 1969 to 1974, saw an oppourtinity. He saw th<b> e ol</b>d 'Dixiecrats' were breaking away from the Democrats because of civil rights.\nHe could harness white anger and get those Southern votes in what he called 'the southern strategy.' He harnessed racial animosity through coded language about drugs and 'law and order.' (We know this to be fact due to later interviews and the white house tapes.)\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan won the Republican nomination in 1980, it was the first time there was a presidenti<b> al ra</b>ce without George Wallace since the civil rights act.\n\nReagan had to secure those southern votes. What was the first place he went to campaign as the nominee?\nTo a fair near Philadelphia Mississippi.\n\nThis place was famous because 3 civil rights advocates, Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner were murdered in this county in 1964. The locals did a sham investigation because the whole community was in on it.\nIt took the FBI to come in amd bring justice.\n\nWhat was the first thing future president Ronald Reagan said, as the new nominee, in the county known for murdering civil rights advocates and covering it up?\n\"I Believe in States Rights!\"\n\nSounds a lot like Wallace, doesnt it?\n\nThats when all <b> the </b>old unrepentant Dixiexrats like Strom Thurmond, Jessie Helms, David Duke, ect ect switched parties.\n\nThats why the Charlottesville 'unite the RIGHT' rally had both Nazis and KKK.\n\nIm not saying all Republicans are KKK, not at all. But the Republican Party deliberately courted the devil as the Democrats conducted an exorcism; now Republicans are dealing with the consequences.",

Capitalism enables making a profit by owning stuff, usually land or machines, or in this case instead of machines slaves. This is also not my opinion but a fact: Some people in (mostly southern) America made money because the slaves they owned produced goods they could sell. The system was reformed but wealthy families stayed wealthy. And with this new Capital (money) they could further benefit from capitalism since owning stuff makes a profit in it.\nI'm not saying that capitalism in America is defined by slavery today but in the beginning, it was. That's what I meant by basis.",

(Stats are from a few years ago)\n\nThis pattern fits historic<b> al raci</b>sm in the United States, as the 2nd Amendment was always designed to allow whites to police white space.  To oppress restive natives and uppity slaves.\nJust 2 centuries ago the Mississippi river was lined with seve<b> red bl</b>ack slave heads. \nJust last centu<b> ry a b</b>lack men could be tortured to death by grievous matulation culminating in slowly burning to death feet first. Whites would not be punished.\n\nToday, white men are encouraged to <b> shoot </b>black men with indemnity thanks to SYG.\n\n...\n\nAlso, voter supression laws. Just google 'Republican admits voter supression racist' and you will get tons of hits from multiple states.\n\n...\n\nAnd if we want to expand this, Arizona recently had their 'show me your paper laws,' which meant that hispanics would be pulled over more and the cops would demand their citizenship or immigration paperwork.  Let me ask you, do you keep your SSN or birth certificate on you at all times? If youre hispanic and in Arizona, the answer better be yes or else.\n\n...\n\nAnd lastly, it is legal to fire or evict someone simply for being LGBTQ in more than half of the US states. There was recently a teacher fired in Texas simply because she innocently mentioned her wife. Thats perfectly legal.",

You walked right into that one.\n\nBut again, why are you framing the ddbate that way? Just because Im not playing your game and fitting into your box does not mean you win.\nPedantry does not a win make.\n\nYou have yet to make any actual arguments.",

Because people fight hate woth hate,<b>  racism</b> wit<b> h racis</b>m, leading them into a cycle where they blame everyone else for their own downfall, instead of fighting hate with lov<b> e, raci</b>sm with true acceptance of another... No body does <b> it. Bl</b>ack. White. Blue (daboodeba<b> ..),</b> fat or skat. \n\n People today don't want to be free. They want to be angry and hatful so they can feel justified for their lust for victimhood, and attention. The big \"movement\" of today has people blinded to the point they are rioting, dragging people along streets to rip their skin apart... Beating and killing women and children. \n\nThe sickest part is that it is taking place in the west, where the ones rioting ag<b> ainst r</b>acism, rape, child abuse and murder are the ones doing those things. \n\nSomeone says \"think of the children\", and turns around to brutally attack a mother and their child fpr wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" shirt.",

The reason i find it funny is more a personal option, cant fraise it better but u get my juist. TED was always, in my opinion based on \"ideas worth sharing\" and the exploration of science tech etc etc. These come with a high bar when it comes to evidence and general persuasion for the audience. As, humanities and social studies are science fields this is backed up by the prior comment. As i am from a background of work with logic and heavy evidence (programmer), i find it funny that a persons defence for this is that it is infact science. while, on stage, there was <b> race </b>baiting, an artist and a costume party. Not my idea of a science field, now humour is subjective so i would rather u argue my points not my finding it funny, and please, dont correct my grammer and such, frankly its not something i care for.",

What I am saying is that too many people are focusing on the worst part of our history and trying to further divid is with that.  I am saying the truth, that slavery in the America's started 200 years before there was ever a US.  I am telling you the little known fact that 70% of the founders wanted to end slavery BEFORE they even signed the Declaration of Independence, and argued more over THAT, than any other thing.  In the end, they realized that the colonies who wanted to keep it, were never going to change their minds.  Realizing that, they decided to first gain independence from the throne of England, then abolish slaver later.  We are the only <b> nation </b>on Earth to have fought a war WITH ITSELF, to end slavery.  That is a historical fact and all I'm saying, is let's stop focusing on the mere fact that there WAS slavery (we already know that) and at give credit where credit is due... the US brought an end to an institution that it DID NOT itself, create.",

Learning our history is also not something I find to be very divisive, because as you point out, many parts of our history are empirical, indisputable facts. We can understand and regret our history collectively in order to make our future better. Or as I think somebody famous said, we learn about the past to guide our present and better our future. \n\nYou're totally correct that we should learn about and study all aspects of slavery, not just the very worst parts, but I don't think that is in contradiction to this video at all, it's simply additional information.\n\nKnowledge is power, and as long as Texas public schools use textbooks that describe slaves as 'workers' (https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/10/23/450826208/why-calling-slaves-workers-is-more-than-an-editing-error), we have to do a better job at education people about our history.",

A good way to try thinking about it is: \"How could he have a talk about American <b> racism </b>and slavery that doesn't make him a bigot?\". Try challenging his argument from that perspective and see what you can come up with. Share if you come up with anything, then we can all improve future dialogue on the subject. That's like the very definition of TED TALKS, it shouldn't be \"no or yes\". Things that are a no or a yes aren't worth discussing to begin with.",

It was the Democratic party created and supported slavery in America, Segregation, and the KKK.

People also forget Africans, Natives, and so on also had slaves from their own <b> race </b>and others. They wanted people to forget that, so it makes it seem like whites were the only ones who did and were all powerful, when it's not true.
