        "postText": "Worcester is a diverse, small city, full of great people from many corners of the world, where we have all lived side by side unhindered by any cultural or religious differences for many years.', 'As the general secretary of Worcester Muslim Welfare Association, I am devastated to hear that on Saturday the English Defence League (EDL) will be holding an Islamophobic march in my city.', 'Later this year, Worcester Muslim Welfare Association has decided it will showcase a new relocated mosque project to the whole community. Since it was announced, racial and Islamophobic tensions have started to creep into our community, eating away at tolerance this city once enjoyed.', 'We wanted to give the city something new and bold, and make improvements in an area that really needed it. Our partners of faiths, non-faiths and the general community showed their support for this project and gave positive feedback at all stages of design, backing our philosophy behind this project, which was to create more cohesive and integrated community.', 'But what for us was such a positive project has escalated into something more sinister. Hate-fuelled propaganda from the far-right is trying to destroy the very fabric of diversity and integration we are all trying to achieve.', 'Last month, the EDL came to Worcester preaching Islamophobia under the banner of freedom of speech. Their purpose was to sow the seed of hate towards the mosque. Vile speeches and abusive language were hurled towards our religion, our prophet and our scriptures.', 'Our community and many other faith groups saw this not as freedom of speech, but pure racist and Islamophobic propaganda in an attempt to create a reaction.', 'The community was betrayed by police, who allowed the EDL to get away with using this language. One month later, the police again have allowed these people a platform to verbally abuse us. This has hindered any good relationship the community was trying to build with police and completely eroded any sense of trust.', 'Myself and other trustees will attend a counter-protest. We will be supporting all the groups who have come to show solidarity towards this small Muslim community.', 'We strongly feel the police and the council have made a mistake by allowing this group to come again in short space of time since the last event.', 'Today will see a number of events which have long been planned to mark the battle of Worcester, but this EDL march will distract from the celebrations, waste hardworking taxpayers\u2019 money and affect our local businesses.', 'We support peaceful freedom of speech, which has helped this country prosper throughout history, but we cannot condone the radical, racist, far-right provocations the EDL is known for.', 'Our message to authorities is to use common sense and not let this happen again, learn from previous mistakes and most importantly listen to voices from the community they represent.",

That in turn gives rise to the anger you see voiced through the EDL and others.Fundamentally it is the behaviour that arrises from muslim  communities that gives rise to this anger. Without that the police wouldn't have to act at all, responsibly or irrisponsibly. You, Mr Iqbal and your fellow co-religionists are the ones who are failing muslims",

            "commentText": "What about the hatred and intolerance by Islam around the world. Where in any Muslim country can Christians build a Church? We know that you are part of the plan for a global caliphate under Sharia law. There are already enough mosques in this country to accommodate muslims,  and still you want more. There is no such thing as islamophobia, it is rational concern as we have read your Koran and noted it's hatred toward non Muslims and exhortations to kill non Muslims. You cannot live peacefully with any other religious belief as history shows us, 80 million Hindus in India alone, for example, slaughtered. I would ask anyone reading this to look up this site falseislam.org",

You don't like this?? Then go to a country where snowflakes like u can't have freedom of speech, I heard Saudi Arabia is perfect for people like you.",

I don't like the EDL I don't like what they stand for but they have the right in a free country to have thier say. You and the liberal left are pulling away political platforms for those you don't agree with. Before you pull the not being free from consequence that is only when inticing violence. Will you stand up and write the same scathing column when a radical muslim starts spouting hate speech, will you call on limiting thier freedom of speech, or is that islamaphobic and religious intolerance. The hypocrisy of left is astouding.",
