        "postText": "The Duchess of York made a reference to women being \u201cpitted against and compared with each other\u201d in a most likely swipe at the media for the apparent feud between Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton. Meghan and the Duchess of Cambridge have faced months of rumours of a royal rift. These rumours were only heightened when Kensington Palace confirmed that Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex were moving away from London and over to Windsor.', 'She also revealed the way women are compared online reminds her of how she and Diana were presented as \u201crivals\u201d.', 'The Duchess of York wrote in her open letter in Hello: \u201cTake a look at any website, and you\u2019ll see extraordinarily abusive comments aimed not only at people in the public eye but also other internet user.', '\u201cBullying, sniping, b***hing, even the most appalling sexism, racism and homophobia are commonplace - it seems that online, anything goes.', '\u201cWomen, in particular, are constantly pitted against and compared with each other in a way that reminds me of how people tried to portray Diana and me all the time as rivals, which is something neither of us ever really felt\u201d.', 'She also wrote in the letter: \u201cIt\u2019s time to confront head on the fact that much of social media has become a sewer.\u201d', 'While Sarah acknowledged the internet could be a \u201cforce for good\u201d, she insisted it is \u201ctime to take a stand\u201d against online abuse.', 'The duchess has hundreds of thousands of followers on her Instagram and Twitter pages.', 'Sarah - who is patron of Street Child - regularly posts about her charity work as well as family updates.', 'No officials have ever confirmed that there is any rift between the Duchess of Sussex and the Duchess of Cambridge or Prince Harry and William.",
