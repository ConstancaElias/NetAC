    "commentText": "Being a zoomer myself (born in '01) I can say that many of us are in some ways quite bitter towards the world. We were born into a post 9/11 America, 2 wars that were for the most part unpopular, and an economic recession that saw many of our parents either lose their jobs, or have salaries cut. And we saw millennials either struggling as adults or acting like children. But I think that being a generation to grow up with the internet, we were able to express our opinions a lot more among each other without the \"shuddup you're just a kid\" argument being thrown at us. And we have a diversity of thought because of this that is totally unprecedented. There's a lot to be bitter about in the world. But I think for the most part that gen z is good at transforming that bitterness into a reason for good discussion.",

    "commentText": "As a gen X'er,  I feel for the gen z's. My niece and nephew (my sister's kids) and my daughter are gen z. My son is born after them in 2008 so I don't know what he'd be. I'm reading some comments on how social media may not be causing anxiety or depression, but rather it's the state of the world that is, and I totally agree. The kids are REALLY scared for the future but feel powerless so they escape thru electronics, they feel super timid about social rules being and not being offensive and are insecure and super sensitive in a crippling way. It makes me shake my head that people want to blame something else rather than look at the world they're leaving to them as a major cause. Especially the boomers. My mom is a boomer. She divorced three times. My brothers are millennials and never married and one still lives in my moms basement. They're scared of relationships. They're screwed up. She does not fully understand how hard it is for the other generations. My daughter just started high school and last year she had to pick her courses. What do you tell a kid who may not even see half the jobs existing by the time she graduates? When my son graduates, will university even exist? Already it's becoming obsolete and too expensive. It's a dinosaur and behind the times. Many companies will train directly because many degrees will mean nothing. Education is still stuck in rural farming culture. The biggest fears are the economy, and climate change. It's not encouraging to see boomers so selfish and critical of younger generations even denying  climate change altogether because they don't want to change their lifestyle or give up comfort.",

I'm also 13 but I have never felt depressed or felt anxiety from what iv'e seen is that we are actually pretty optimistic but somehow we have a STRANGE obsession with sexuality? TBH from what I heard before the 90s like I guess kids had more freedom like they could literally stay outside until the light flickers or go to the movies by themselves. I want that experience while I am still young cause I'm practically a teen now and tbh I want more time.",

    "commentText": "I have Replied on this Post for a while now, But this is my final one. Generation Z is a Young but not the Youngest generation out there. There is Gen Alpha, Whom literally always finds ways to Play with the Tech available to them. Gen Z is a Multi-Personality Generation, So you obviously can't speak for all of us. I'm currently in 7th Grade, but tbh, Me and MILLIONS of Gen Z feel as though they are Cheated or Ignored by the School System, and put as a Puppet. When most of us go to explain it to our Parents or Family, Many of them above the Age of 20 say \"your generation is just lazy\" or \"we did much more work than you ever did\". In a way, They are right, But mostly no. Millennials are the Generation just above us, and who still believe we are apart of them or a Puppet. Back in 2009, I used to see that the Millennials in my Family treated me and my Fellow Gen Z Family members like utter Dirt, While the Millennials were treated (not like angels but similar). 10 years later, In 2019, Me and my Gen Z family members are Grown as they were 10 years Earlier, But we are treated like Children, Even though we qualify as Teenagers. Moving on, Gen Y is VERY Similar to Millennials, So similar in fact, They are often being Joined into the Generation. Gen X, The Generation above Gen Y/Millennials is a very different Generation. They are very Organic and Nature going and often believe the 1950's/1940's are some of the Best decades in American History. Like almost all Generations before and after, You cannot Speak for all. Most of Gen X is the way the Stereotype is, The Nature going/Natural Organic/Angered at literally Everything wrong kind. Baby Boomers, Baby Boomers are one of the most \"different\" Generations out there, Simply because they were Hippies while most of their Children became Hipsters and their Parents being the Average 1950's Kind. Baby Boomers are the ones who do blame us for being messed up due to \"social media\" and Iphone use, But in reality, They were the ones who made it after all, Apple, Microsoft.. Etc.. Going deeper, The Silent Generation is one of the few, Very \"antique\" Generations. They are in fact (Different but not Different). They are the Reason Factories were able to bring up Economic Growth for Gen X, But ultimately failing to Help other Generations due to their motto for Kids/Teens: \"To be Seen, But not to Speak\" Or something like that. I would continue this, But time matters, so I will end this with one, Very simple Signing to my Fellow Gen Z, and also Gen Alpha: Pls fricken make this world greater and end the corrupt school system pls ;-;, the school system is a failure, and we should all learn via online (from tuesday to thursday), if this happens for workplaces as well, depression and stress make go down a bit, so pls do it :)",

I‚Äôm passionate about art and biology, and I want to help people who serve in the armed forces, to be a support to lean on.

    "commentText": "This video is liberal media prapaganda. Gen Z and even more as you get older continuing into what the most accurate polls can predict, the next years of voters will be more and more and more conservative than the last years of voters with exceptions for typical party intervals. They are expected when they are all of voting age to be solidly conservative politically and extremely entreprenerial similar to gen Xer's but the degree to how socially liberal+conservative will be surprising. The ONLY thing confusing those media talking about Gen Z/iGen that aren't making propaganda pieces is that they seem socially \"liberal\" and conservative on punishment as well as economically conservative/liberal, except liberal in this sense refers to the laws while conservative refers to society's responsibility to people while liberal also refers to it's traditional political meaning and not it's reversed leftist meaning of \"authoritarian progressive social laws that criminalizes all traditions and things older generations value,\" into meaning they are very liberal with the law with regards to social issues but very traditional with regards to expectations and the expression of those expectations (that fall under liberal social laws that allow expression for and against mainstream), economically traditionally american and conservative, both in their spending and the government's.",

Every generation has had serious issues, whether you like to address it or not, for example, ( racism, slavery, sexism, normalised abuse, homophobia, freaking WW1 and 2..)\n\nAnd yet, with all the other far more major problems that have occured, what will be the most tolerant and advanced people that will likely accomplish so many wonderous things, are being criticized for spending too much time on their phones.. A very minor issue compared to the rest of human history if you ask me..\n\nMay I add that criticising children and calling them stupid for technology overuse has a sort of sick and twisted feeling to it? It's almost as if saying that they're already predestined to be moronic druggies that can't do anything useful for anyone.\n\nMocking the younger generations has always existed and different generations just have different cultures than you do,criticising it doesn't make you better than anyone.\n\nAnyway, those are just my views, have a nice day to whoever is reading.",

My cousin is only 8 and has never been seen without a tablet in her hand. As a gen Z member, I remember how everyone was amazed by the iPhone. It was kind of unfathomable to have a phone like that. Our house had only one computer which everyone in the house used. Eventually everyone got a laptop or desktop but that‚Äôs because they became easier to purchase. Also, there was an increase for them in childhood education. Sure, I learned how to work a computer at school, and I‚Äôve learned the proper way you should be surfing the web; it wasn‚Äôt a big of a thing to use technology until I was in middle school. Advances in phones, tablets, and computers made it easy for anyone to communicate, research, and veg out however they wanted.\nWhat I think that is forgotten is that now, the teenagers who are constantly on their phones, are seen more as introverted losers. When in fact, this is the opposite. We go through the same social experiences as the older generations. We aren‚Äôt unable to relate to others. We go through break ups, fall outs, drama, gain friends, build international relationships, learn about various cultures, keep up with family all using our phones. Sure it‚Äôs not pen and paper, or face to face, but at it‚Äôs core it is still considered communicating. It‚Äôs the same as sending a letter and waiting for a response, but only quicker. \nMost people have mental disorders because there is no barrier from the real world, the thousands of ads we receive in one hour, and the pressure that we have to be better than our predecessors simply because we can type things fast. We process so much that it‚Äôs hard to put it down when almost every thing you see is designed to prey on the weakest parts of your mind.",

The self-help and body positivity movement is thriving, as is minimalism, zero-waste, and nomadic lifestyles.

    "commentText": "Saying phones make people depressed is not exactly the same, but similar to saying that books and talking to people make people depressed. Phones and computers are for the most part replacing books and face to face talking. It‚Äôs the things people use it for. You can talk to a really terrible person or a really great person irl or on the internet and it will have a very similar effect on people. You can read a book that makes you feel bad or a really inspiring one whether it‚Äôs a paper copy or an iBook.The internet is a resource that is highly accessible and infinitely diverse. You can learn just about anything, talk to just about anyone, watch and listen to just about anything, find history and math and literature; you don‚Äôt need a book anymore because it‚Äôs right at your finger tips. The depression comes when people decide to take in things that make them feel depressed like I suppose maybe social media but once again it all depends on what people are looking at. Addictions to phones are real and I myself am definitely addicted but what if this is just how we‚Äôre evolving? I mean I suppose I‚Äôm addicted to air too. This is how humans live now. Correlation is not causation just because depression has recently become widespread and technology has as well does not necessarily mean they are connected and if they are, it doesn‚Äôt mean they are connected in the way they appear to be. Maybe technology can help depression.",

    "commentText": "Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm born in the wrong generation but I feel as if there is a lot of pressure growing up in these times. And as accepting as a lot of us are of things that weren‚Äôt accepted years ago, if you wanna set your phone down and not text back for awhile, people act like you die or don‚Äôt care about them at all. Over a simple conversation. It‚Äôs like everyone feels entitled to attention 24/7 and they blame you in some way of being a problem. Start something out of nothing. Of course someone of this generation can go outside and get away from technology but it gets lonely sometimes. Almost like it‚Äôs weird behavior for an average kid/teenager. Inviting a friend is a hit or miss. They could either be on the same page as you or most likely, bring their phone to snap a selfie. But at the same time, I understand bringing your phone for safety reasons. That was the intention of phones in the beginning. Contact. Emergency. But I almost feel as if that leads to someone eventually going on their phone out of habit. If you have little self control... of course you‚Äôll check every 10 minutes. Now it seems the amount of followers and appreciation you get, determines self worth. Technology is amazing, I just wish that people could embrace both life and technology and important and not. This is just my thoughts on this. I just turned 19 this year and I feel as if it‚Äôs hard to keep contact with people who have (so far) lived the majority of their lives online. No one can really say how this will turn out as kids will get older but I just hope my kids get a choice or can get balance between the real world and the online world. I just want them to be able to have a choice and be happy.",

I watched cartoons on a box tv with an antenna. I grew up with more VHS than DVD movies, and even when I got DVD‚Äôs, they were normal ones cause Blu-ray wasn‚Äôt really a thing yet. I didn‚Äôt get an actual working phone until 8th grade, and that was only because I had after school clubs. If I wanted to use a real cellphone, I could... but there‚Äôd be no battery or no SIM card in it. And I was fine with that. My family didn‚Äôt alway have cable. For half of my life, we‚Äôd have cable for Maybe a couple of years before it got shut off because we couldn‚Äôt afford to pay it. I remember dial-up somewhat because we had a super old computer, and I clearly remember using a landline until I was about 14 or 15. But, what I don‚Äôt get is why my parents, the same ones who wouldn‚Äôt buy me my own phone until I was almost in high school, have gotten my 11 year old sister an iPhone, 2 ipads, and a kindle. She‚Äôs 11. She only needs the iPad cause it‚Äôs for school, and that‚Äôs it.",

Older generations somehow have this mindset that phones are the cause of everything bad that happens to gen z.  In my opinion, being on your phone distracts you from the crappy real life for a while. I think a lot of gen Z people are depressed because of the world the past generations have created for us, which is why we are more open to different races, sexualities, religions, etc. I think gen Z is going to be the generation that paves the way for the next generations to be more accepting of others and explore more opportunities.",

And thank you for including 9/11, because I‚Äôve always felt that this would be the determining factor that makes ‚ÄúGen-Zers‚Äù different than the other generations; we grew up in a world‚Äîa culture, sometimes‚Äîof terrorism. PLEASE don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîI know the other generations had wars (they‚Äôre called ‚Äúthe Silent Generation‚Äù for a reason) and they were horrible, and people are still dealing with the effects and hauntings (and I‚Äôm entirely grateful for what they did)‚Äîbut for the effect 9/11 had on everything... I mean, it effected not only security, government, and science, but also technology and pop culture (look up the effect on ‚ÄúLilo & Stitch‚Äù and Spider-Man). It effected everything. I feel like I‚Äôm not alone or going out on a limb to say that 9/11 is in a league of its own. So, I feel like it may be what has made the culture ‚ÄúGen-Zers‚Äù (is this the right term?) have/are growing up in so different from previous generations, and what is creating these different people, these different mindsets, outlooks, ideals we have now.\n\nYour thoughts?

But we must realize that as early as now we need to solve it.\n The old generation would leave the future with something they started that they didnt know could create a problem and the generation z are left to solve it which is very inconsiderate. But then again, so was the generation before them to them haha.",

By that logic Japan, certain parts of Africa, UK, Germany, Poland and more should change. Some countries went through huge changes while others didn't.\n\nThe idea of basing a generation on tragic events mainly from the US is ridiculous.\n\nIf we go by a tragedy that messed up every country all Generations would have to change and some unchanged.\n\nYou can correct me on this opinion.\n\nTo those using personal experience, everyone is different with some similarities due to riches (poor, middle class or rich), ethnic background, religious or no beliefs, and how you were brought up.\n\nYou can be 30, 20 and 8 but be brought up by the same generation with similar things within the household and values but only differ due to changes in neighbourhood and background.\n\nSome of the newest gens alpha Z and oldest Gen Y were raised by Gen X, thanks to egg freezing, surrogates and....single mothers doing their thing.\n\nIf we add changes to education, gaming systems and apps (some are using as change of generation) that would make generations ridiculously small. People in the 80's had games and cartoons that still being made so I wouldn't use that as a generational difference since those things started earlier.\n\nJust a cusp opinion generation 5years before 2000.",

This is something which I've seen people from our generation do, they refuse to go out and seek help, even though there's plenty of therapists and others available. This is just my observation everyone has their reasons for not going, some don't trust anyone to open up, but they still should do the effort to find someone to help them.",

Yeah, I'm Gen-Z by technicality, I use technology to write and communicate because I have anxiety and depression, but that depression came later on in life when people started telling me I was going to fail because of my career ideas. I didn't grow up using computers. I grew up running around in the backyard and wanting to be a cowgirl with a big truck. Then I learned about writing and dance and I have to use the internet for some of the connections with that and help because people hear \"I want to be a dancer\" or \"I want to be a writer\" and then bam! \"You're going to be a failure\". But I go online to research how I can make it possible  and bam! \"You rely on the internet too much, why don't you ask people around you for help\" like... bitch. Nobody around me knew how to dance or thought I should be a dancer. Did you want me to run away to the city, possibly end up on the streets alone hating myself everyday or killed? Or in the same safe enviorment, hating myself because of how much you tell me I'll never be worth anything and progressing in my career digitally?",

I went out with my friends before I had a phone (and after?üòÇ) but I rode my bike, went camping with my friends, had the best  sleepovers, played in my back yard all day, went to my friends houses in the summer and I feel like the kid kids today won‚Äôt be able to do as much because of the dangerous internet and it‚Äôs sad but I‚Äôm grateful my mom and dad didn‚Äôt get me a phone until a year ago so I could enjoy my life without one while I can, but even now I don‚Äôt go on it a lot mainly due to the fact I have no friends lol",

Using social media makes us depressed, so we try to escape that through using social media, and other forms, such as legal highs, etc. Then the mainstream media, especially in the UK, highlight this as a cause of depression but blame the social media companies for not doing enough to prevent it (see this article here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47160460). I think instead of Governments blaming, they should increase funding for health services to support us. Maybe it's generations not understanding us",

    "commentText": "I'm currently in 8th grade, so I would like to inform some adults what goes on in a Gen Z's day to day life. I would like to inform you that we are not what we think. \n\nIn my school, I can't speak for others, the kids are pessimistic, tired, sad, and opinionated. \"See Something, Say Something\"(an initiative based on preventing violent acts and improving student mental health through student awareness of problems and learning to see signs of depression in and outside of school, mostly based on social media) is shoved down our throats, teaching us do something most of us refuse to do, not for our sake, but for others. Almost all of us know what it is like to be in a dark place, and we know that adults knowing that you don't want help from does nothing but hurt you. We are too sympathetic to do something before they try to handle it themselves, but no adult understands that, and rather sees mental illness as something that they could prevent by forcing the child to talk. \nIn my school, we talk about what a wreck the school system is. State testing gives us anxiety that we can't afford. We retain very little of what we learn, a result of being taught to learn for a test, and not to learn for ourselves. We find our interests outside of school and have intelligent disscussions about these interests with our friends. We pressure ourselves to succeed in school, even though we find most of it pointless, because if we don't do well our failure will be on the news, mocking us for being the \"worst generation yet.\" In my favorite class, English, we have class political discussions and have Socratic Circles, a learning form borrowed from Socrates, in which we teach each other based on what we already in an organized and polite disscussion. That is the only class I have ever taken in which the teacher encouraged us to be free thinkers, further our learning by ourselves, and to pursue our interests. In fact, we once had a debate on whether Fantastic Beasts was racist or sexist because of an article that a student read. Our teacher assigned homework that night was to research the issue, form an educated response, and be ready to discuss it with the class the following day. Our generation believes that learning like that furthers us, and learning based on a test hinders us. \nIn my school kids consistently get an unheathly 4 to 8 hours of sleep. Studies show that this effects our ability to learn immensely, as well as our mental heath, and physical growth. Not only are we physically tired, we are mentally tired. Tired of having to break down walls adults have thrown up, tired of putting up walls around adults because we are scared of our beliefs getting out. We just want it to stop.\nIn my school, although we are depressed and sleep deprived and annoyed, we want to change the world. We have lofty goals and would do so much to accomplish them. I don't know what career I want, but I want to change the world. I want to make someone's life better, to put a smile on their face. I don't know what that is yet, but it might end up having something to do with the psychology field. I find it incredibly interesting. I know other kids do too, but none of us say anything, because when we do, people are concerned that we are depressed or need a therapist our self. Every kid I know has a passion for something. Every kid I know wants to change the world, to fix what the adults messed up. \n\nSo yeah, we're a wreck. But we also have our heads on straight. Social media is not just an escape, but a learning system. We don't know if there's hope, but we want to make our own. So maybe we're better than you thought, or maybe we're worse. \nMy friend gave me an interesting fact the other day: they used to put people on insane asylums based on stress levels. Based on tested fact and observation, almost all of our generation should be locked up by those standards. As a generation, we intend to change this, even if we lose everything in the process. \n\nThat is what Gen Z is like. Depressed, but determined. Thanks for reading.",

In my highschool and university years everyone was sleep deprived (and some at work even). My generation also suffers from general anxiety, i dont get how it became such an epidemic. Just yesterday we were almost 10 people between 25-30 and suddenly we realized almost all of us had major anxiety.\n\nAnd about depression for the future, i actually think things in some countries are going to shit but on the bright side i see people becoming more tolerant, more accepting, more united. So just give it time. Right now my generation is (or is becoming) the main work force and we are changing how we work, what is expected. Older people in businesses are being forced to change cause they need to retain young talent and we dont care about the corner office or that dumb stuff, we care about life quality. So yeah, basically, we still have hope :)\n\nI think we are going on the right direction. I just hope that when my generation gets into politics and become the presidents of our countries they will do things better. I still worry about how in some countries (mine included) people praise such dumb political figures. But idk, maybe the educated group of my generation will be the future presidents and your generation, that is more concerned about the world in general, will vote for them and we will see a brighter future :)\n\nHope this helped somehow!",

I feel like we use social media as a learning system, something that can allow us to broaden our views on life via instant communication and access to information. Its still a form of socializing, it may not be in the traditional sense but it is. Every day I see us form bonds and friendships with people of all backgrounds all around the world due to social media and it really helps break down walls, barriers and preconceived misconceptions.",

So many adults in my life and on the news (of which I've seen) talk about the bad and the only thing I think of is ‚ÄùOk, how the hell can I change this?!‚Äù I have had many conversations about college, my main problem is not ‚ÄùWhat do I want to do with my life?‚Äù rather, ‚ÄùWhat can I do that will help?‚Äù  I am willing to learn and do whatever I possibly can to help the future of the world.

Parents these days are getting more and more protective of their kids and where they can physically go or hang out with even though things are getting less and less dangerous but the media and all the stories that many parents have access to scares them. Many young kids no longer play out on the street or walk down like a ways in their neighbor hood to visit their friend, or to maybe walk down to a local restaurant or to school. There's spontaneity in how kids can interact and it makes it hard for them because kids and teens don't tend to think in the way many adults do when it comes to planning simple interactions. for many kids who do have that freedom it's typically a text or a facetime and they're already headed towards their friends house. It's hard wanting to simply just hang out with your friend without knowing all that's gonna happen, so when your parents demand phone numbers, a time table, a detailed list of activities its hard for kids to give them these things because they dont know.",

    "commentText": "I think the cut off point for gen z (as a gen zer) should be between 2006 to 08 because those born after that didn‚Äôt experience the economic depression of 2008/9 and therefore will act quite differently from those born 1995 to 2006. Right now for a lot of the world, the economy is looking up and those kids who are between 10 and 6 rn will only know a childhood where their parents could afford to, say, buy the more expensive options in the store. Plus, as a sixteen year old, I would find it a little hard to believe that that a child born the same year that the iPhone 5 released will have a similar childhood to me (b.2002).",

    "commentText": "Just gonna shout out that the speed at which technology developed between 1995-2012 was astronomical and there are very, very few similarities between the children born at each end of that spectrum. 1995-2003, and then 2004-2012+, would be much more appropriate. I was born in 2000, and am currently in university, and every encounter I've had with someone born after 2005 has shown how different our childhoods were. Obviously, those born closer to 2010 are still in their childhood, but there are some very fundamental differences in upbringing that make it impossible to compare our age groups. I distinctly remember a time when iPhones didn't exist. When the iPod nano was the greatest technology. When blackberries were the backbone of our nation, and how much the iPod Touch changed everything for kids. I burned CD's, my main \"technological\" form of entertainment was CD computer games, my family did weekly Friday trips to blockbuster for movie night, and I memorized the days and times my favorite shows would come on TV. Yes, using Word and Powerpoint and being able to do online research was integral to my schooling, but that was something we had to teach ourselves because adults were still learning too. Social media didn't exist; those without strict parents had MySpace, and then in late childhood had FaceBook (not me), but \"Youtubers\" didn't exist, \"Instagram personalities\" didn't exist. Technology was not integral to our social environment. Kids born in 2010 have phones at the age of 8, because that's what's normal. I see 10 year olds on Instagram, completely exposed to current celebrity culture and fashion and crazy representation of the ideal body/lifestyle, born in 2008; Instagram didn't even exist when I was 10, and the idealization of celebrities was not nearly as big, with the only way to keep updated being TigerBeat and Seventeen (magazines). Kids born in 2012 were given iPads to entertain them as babies. It bothers me to have my year get grouped in with 2004+ because we really don't have anything in common, yet experts who study generations have never recognized this.",

    "commentText": "What gets me mad is the fact that most adults think they know so much about technology, that \"it's bad and will negatively affect our future generations\". In some ways, yes it will. We can become more self-centered and their are bad uses to tech. But if you choose to use it properly, you can help create a better world for yourself and others. We now have access to things they didn't teach in school, we can work on any skill, anytime, and have a lot of opinions and things to see. We can change our views, and not just believe the things the people around us do. Before technology, we never really knew the consequences of our actions and people who haven't been traveling in the sea might not have noticed the trash that's washing up all over it. With our technology we can create positive change and influence others around us to do the same. We can communicate with people we might never would've been able to without tech. It has many bad sides such as cyberbullying, hate, and can be used for doing the opposite as mentioned in the good side.You can also share much media and this tremendously helps develop small companies (which also helps the economy). I think the world has been made into better place with technology, and we're finally starting to care more about solving world issues and fixing the environment. We've helped clean up what the last generation has left and are helping people and ecosystems worldwide through the use of technology. And hopefully our future generations will continue to do the same. Sorry for the very long comment, I just had to rant about this common misconception.\n\nEDIT: And yes, I do consider it unhealthy if you're on your phone too often. It can lead to depression and anxiety, and we need to balance it. I'm just saying that technology is a very useful tool if you use it properly and responsibly.",

Gen Z is set to be the least religious generation ever,  we're more inclined to believe in science and research things on our own, we are the most pro vaccine generation, for our age we are the least sexually active generation. We don't drink or smoke. We lean to the left as social democrats, but we understand why socialism didn't work - authoritarianism. \n\nWe aren't stupid. We think critically, we're realistic to a detriment, we are determined to clean up the mess people like you have made of our Earth.  \n\nDo you want to know why birth rates are projected to fall once we reach our childrearing years? We don't want to raise a child in a world as toxic and disgraceful as this one. \n\nWe see the dark side of our achievements as a species.

Parents teach us that if you don't study well, nothing will happen in your life. We see bodies of water filled with trash, landfills that extend for miles, plastic everywhere. One day, when we're an adult, we will have to clean up the mess you made. We are the ones who have to suck it up and listen to you going off on how we are always glued with our phones, obsessed with social media. I'm not trying to be rude here, but can older people just stop it with those? We experience the most suicide rates and yet you still like to rub it on us that were useless and pathetic, more you're wondering why this is happening. People may call me pessimistic but I'm honestly trying to be realistic. \n\n\n\nAnyway sorry for this long ass rant, I just wanted to get it is my mind. Also I don't mean if your older you're already like what I was talking about. I just see most of the adults are like this.",

Also, getting rid of cars using gas, since that's what caused global warming in the first place. Keep them where they belong, in the museum's so future generations can see how we lived",

I and plenty of others I know prefer to meet and talk in person but with the increased paranoia of millenial and late gen-x parents we end up being stuck at home and away from other people making us have to turn to the internet for social interactions. Besides communication we also end up getting into the world at a later time with the average age of being allowed outside without an adult raised from 5 to 13.",

They coasted off the fact that they were the children of the Greatest Generation (look them up), and then when it was their turn to lead, they messed almost everything up.\n\nBad work ethic? Most of us throw away our youth and focus almost all our time and energy on school and employment, to the point where we don't have many friends, if any. \n\nPhones are useless? Do you know what we do on them? We read the news, make our planners, do our homework, research, get what social interaction we can, etc. \n\nStop believing that you're better than us - because you've clearly had your view tinted by ideologies that have worn themselves thin, and have become what holds us back as a society. \n\nWe don't live in an Archie comic.

They went to college, accumulated thousands in student loans and then there was a reality check in the real world, and we have seen all kinds of problems with Millennials in the real world. They bitch, whine, and cry about getting paid low wages and not being able to get a job with their gender studies degree, after that they blame the system and vote Democrat in an attempt to create an impossible utopia. Where as Generation Z has been told the most horrendous things that you could possibly imagine due to the internet, a uncensored and unfiltered flow of information. Generation Z was the first generation to be born into the internet age, socially our parents or guardians were not able to protect us from the harsh reality of getting offended as so many parents of Millenials did. And as a result we have the outrage culture perpetuated by Millennial snowflakes, while Generation Z learned to be self reliant, and resilient. And this has many positive results on our generation, while Millennials tend to be optimists, Generation Z tends to be realist, Millennials want to be discovered while Generation Z want to work hard for success, In the realm of maturity Millennials tend to have a prolonged adolescence while Generation Z is \"up-ageing\".",

    "commentText": "As someone from Gen Z i feel like it's not the phones or new technology that's making us  depressed or have mental health problems. A phone or Internet is just a device which makes our lives easier. When older generations say that we spend too much time on our phones i wonder if they realize all the things we actually do with a phone. Talking to friends, reading a book, doing reserch, making our planners, reading articles, watching videos and learning new things everyday. We are not just  doing useless things or simply wasting our time. Lots of us do use our phones for a lot of good. I don't see why phones can make people depressed. If anything it can help a lot of people having mental health issues as there are many things online which help you go through some of the things you go through. You can talk to someone who had gone through similar things that you are dealing with. And trust me i know that it's helpful. However, i think that many of us have mwntal health problems is because we are more open about it. I bet other generations also had lots of people with mental health issues but due to circumstances they didn't really believe it could happen or they weren't so open about it. So basically just stop blaming everything bad that happens to Gen Z on phones.",

Like it or not phones arent very good for you. Most likely youve been up for quite a while because you were on your phone. The amount of activities that are accessible via your phone are infinite. You may not waste your time on your phone, but a lot of people do; including myself.",

We are more realistic in that we don‚Äôt see the world as a sunshine and rainbows. \n\nThe idea that we are the most egalitarian is also something I agree with, but in a different way. While Millennials are more closed-minded towards those they disagree with, gen z is more willing to speak freely and aren‚Äôt pulled toward more antagonistic ideologies. We antagonize for fun, not to say others are the enemy.\n\nWe are more connected with the world than previous generations, but that also doesn‚Äôt mean we are always willing to want to go out and help 24/7, especially in politics. We see that oppression as something that is always going to happen. While we feel it is wrong that others are being oppressed, we are afraid to commit to the idea of being the world policemen like other generations. \n\nIsolationism, with a global awareness is something our generation will probably pride more than previous generations. We would likely volunteer more for charity work in other countries, but don‚Äôt expect our generation to continue the idea of American imperialism.\n\nWe are probably less likely to protest, as we don‚Äôt like confrontation. We are a lot less Politically correct, not because we are less socially-conscious, but we are more likely to believe that it is stupid to get offended over shit if the intent isn‚Äôt to hurt.\n\nWhile millennials were more likely to spread their views through the media, we are more likely to allow people to make their own decisions. While the millennials and generations before were unable to distance themselves away from their ideals in making decisions without proper evidence, gen z is more patient, and aren‚Äôt afraid to suspend belief until justice runs its course.\n\nI feel like pewdiepie is the epitome of what our generation will be like. I‚Äôm not sure what pewdiepie believes in politically, but I know that he is a realist and is sick of outrage culture in the media. \n\nThe electronics thing is somewhat petty, as I believe our generation uses electronics in a different way than previous ones. We use social media like Instagram and Snapchat, which aren‚Äôt really made for spreading any sort of fake news or propaganda. It is because of this that we are more likely to think more independently than other generations who do not know how to use the internet. Our cynicism is in part linked to social media, but our cynicism comes with an understanding that life is never going to be perfect. Our ‚Äúidealists‚Äù are that of a cynical-idealist, who believe perfection may never be reached, but we should always strive for it.\n\nMost gen z people dislike Trump and Clinton, and are sick of the media on both sides sucking one‚Äôs dick, and kicking the other‚Äôs. \n\nIn short, we are less for authoritarianism on both sides of the spectrum as it pertains to social issues.",

My family was first able to buy dialup internet in 2007 but it was basically useless because my mom used the house phone all the damn time. I didn‚Äôt have my first cell phone until 2012 when I was 16 and I only had to get one because I got a job and I needed to let my mom know when I was getting off at work. I‚Äôm not ‚Äútechy‚Äù. I got my first laptop 3 years ago. Oh wait, or is me and my family just poor? Can poorer kids born in the mid and late 1990‚Äôs still be identified as millennials cause I seriously can‚Äôt relate to anything you guys are saying about Gen Z",

We were born into a world of school shootings practically every week and a world where terrorism attacks are basically the norm. We were also born into a world where Americas economy isn't the greatest as education after highscool is hardly affordable without getting a loan and drowning in debt.\n\nThe tuition for colleges grew exponentially as the annual tuition for Yale was $2,550 in 1970s while in 2014 it was $45,800 and the cost for medical care, food, and shelter has also grew exponentially.\n\nYou can't just tell someone who's depressed to be happy.

They had drills where they'd hide under a desk at school to keep cover from an atomic blast, after realising that you basically can't defend that without a bunker, they stopped. And no, if you're poor you don't just automatically have the greatest opportunity to be rich. Calling us wealkings is the equivalent of calling a 3 yo unintelligent because they're unable to speak properly or even at all. This is because a majority of iGen are teens. Also, calling us wealkings is still quite dumb because we can't do much at our ages. And America is also a place where you have to be afraid of shootings anywhere you go. During the first 21 weeks of 2018 there were 23 school shootings. Winston Salem Shooting, Italy Texas shooting, Benton Kentucky, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Oxon Hill, Maryland shooting, Nashville Shooting, Parkland shooting, Savannah Georgia, Itta Bena, Norfolk Virginia, Mount Pleasant, Jackson shooting, Birmingham shooting, Mobile shooting, Seaside shooting, Lexington Park, Gloversville, Raytown, Ocala, Palmdale, Santa Fe, Noblesville, Thousand Oaks, Watertown, must I keep going? Yes? Okay\n\nLong Beach, Tallahassee, Springfield, Minneapolis, Detroit, Vallejo, LA, Riverside 2x, El Dorado, and many more. Being pessimistic is more reasonable than thinking everything is a-okay in the United States. Being the smartest or most popular brings competitiveness. Oh, you want us to be philosophical? Sorry, that's not how the world works. Not everyone has experienced what you have. You're merely speaking off of how you see the world rather than looking at your own generation's panic. You want us to all be philosophical as if it's the answer to everything. Not everyone was born in the same conditioning as you. Empathy is basically the most you could give someone as most of us are too scared to speak to others about our true intentions and/or feelings. Let's take someone who was abused as a child and currently is still abused, tell them to not be pessimistic and tell them to be philosophical, how would that play out?\n\nOh, you're afraid of your father beating you? I'm sure you're just being pessimistic. Someone just threaten your school with a picture of a gun on Snapchat saying, \"Don't go to school tomorrow\" and no one arrives and you think what pessimistic idiots. You just got done hearing of the Syria bombings and watching a couple of children dying, oh, just pessimism. You hear gunshots whilst in school and hide under your desk, oh, why am I being so pessimistic? See how dumb it is? Oh, your two cousins were killed in a school shooting?

Kids these days get all they want and still complain, it's absolutely disgusting to see people who are upset when there is always a choice to be happy in any situation. I went into surgery and I didn't scream and yell, I sat back and made jokes the entire time. I'm 14 and I see that people are weaklings for falling into pessimism, pessimism doesn't help, it just hurts. My mother is a pessimistic person and everyday I see her behavior and realize that she portrays the awful about humanity and optimism and humor is what helps with everything. The British were being bombed in WWll and they were having a dandy time and resisted Hitler, they could've chose to be scared and resisted Hitler, but then all the time they could've spent dandy would be gone.

I don't ussually spend more than 4 hours on a device so I might be less addicted than others but It is tough to play outside with friends as many don't want to and insist on staying inside. This sucks as I don't really like video games. Also Gen Z is honestly either really far right or far left on politics. This of course could be tuned down to the fact that we are kids though.",

We grew up in a world where being different is normal and is often celebrated and discrimination is seen as something awful. We grew up in a world where mental health messages are spread better so more people are aware of it and know they are not struggling alone. Sure there‚Äôs a lot of violence happening but lots of that is caused by people from generations before us, and sure not everyone will grow up to be good, but I know many people my age and younger who want to make a difference in the future and hopefully change this sometimes scary, ugly world into something beautiful and loving.

But then they turned out to be the product of their environment, of video games, of instant gratification and forms of entertainment that encouraged short attention spans, of increasing automation, of greater and greater spans of time, effort, and money invested in higher education just to have a shot at the jobs that their parents took for granted, of runaway inflation making the middle-class life and home ownership increasingly unattainable, of a poor economy, etc. When the Millennials in fact did not transform the world but rather struggled to get by, they were ridiculed and berated by their elders. If you, Gen Z-ers, think that you're so special that all of the above will not apply to you and your generation even more so, then I laud you for your audacity (or naivety). It's your turn next.

Our society has rebuilt a peer system thru phones. The Importance of most kids lives is to be accepted and that starts with socializing online constantly. It‚Äôs all fucking dumb. It‚Äôs honestly just sickening to me to know how normal it is for people to sit on their phones all day. Kids today would of gotten bullied and Harassed in the 80s and 90s. Kids today are either soft or extremely bummy and brag ab doing shady shit. Nobody has a work ethic anymore because times have changed so much. It used to be respected if you were hardworking and had accomplishable goals. Everything is jus different now. Gen Z will be the start on the downfall. I promise you. Nothin lasts forever. \n\nHard times create strong people \nStrong People create Good Times \nGood times create lazy people\nLazy people create hard times. \n\n\nThis is fact.",

(we had only vhs, motorola razr flip phones, the first couple of ipod touch gens, dvd, GameCube, wii, the original Xbox, and playing online games like clubpenguin or whatever) We most likely went outside more too.

I dont wanna say every single teenager out there is like that because there are still some people out there who need to act there age and stuff but if you ask most of the teens questions about society and politics and stuff they always have a saying to it and i know that for a fact because i am a teenager myself and i know how my age groups act in class and in school and there is messing around and stuff but when someone has something to say about the world we live in we all can agree that things needs to change .

I can rest assure you my future kids will not be getting iPads or iPhones or personal computers until at least 10 maybe 12. Kids just don‚Äôt get the roaming around they used too. What also builds on this is the helicopter parents decide to help keep their kids inside with iPads. I mean until I was age 12 I was all over but then I was in a small town and didn‚Äôt roam much because there wasn‚Äôt anywhere to go. When I was 17 I roamed in my first city and rode the bus. Oh my, if you could hear my thoughts they were flying as if were crashing a plane.

Idek I think it‚Äôs weird to not have a grey area between millennial and gen z because so many of us have a unique experience of going from absolutely no internet access to complete immersion in social media etc... I can‚Äôt relate to people whose first phone was a smart phone. I can‚Äôt relate to people who don‚Äôt know what video tapes are etc... but then I know I can‚Äôt relate to going my entire adolescence without having made an msn turned Facebook account etc..  idk I feel like with these 2  generations in particular there has to be a grey area between millennial and gen z because literally SO much changed in such a short period of time. My sister can relate more to me than she can her millennial counterparts who are 10 years older than her. Generation barriers are weird.",

Economics is another issue and more about adaptation to technological changes. But we need young people to stand up for culturally libertarian values. There are signs that this is the case and reassuring. I was born in 1984, so not sure what that makes me, but sometimes I do feel I have more in common with the younger generation than many of my peers.",

    "commentText": "The older generations who criticize Gen Z for spending all their time on electronics don't understand the context or how we've grown up. My entire middle school and high school career have been centered around electronics. I HAVE to have a computer/laptop for school and I have to have a cell phone to communicate with peers for projects, assignments, tests, etc. \n\nI also feel as if teachers have been giving us more homework because it's easier to give when you have the internet and you don't have to print everything out. However, I don't think they understand how difficult this can be for students like me who had mainly paper work in elementary school and quickly had to change to completely internet-based files and assignments. It's hard to navigate, and my early years of education were based around a completely different type of learning style.\n\nI think if schools and the world slowed down for a bit we could all gain our footing. But, as that is evidently never going to happen, the obvious solution would be for all generations to make an effort to respect each other and work to understand each other better. We have to treat everyone as individuals and respect that we are all different people with different learning styles and social skills.\n\n(this is a 12am rant. Sorry for the essay.)",

We are still really young, middle school and elementary school kids can't tell you all that's gonna happen within a generation.\n4. We are exposed to violence all the time because not only is there a lot of it, it's being talked about constantly. We hear about global terrorism and people of our own generation dying because we are abusing what we have.\n5. We are growing into a world that's already been destroyed for us and we don't know how to fix that!!!! We don't know safety anymore and considering the fact that older generations created what they're complaining about, they won't be much help.\n\n\n\n\nThanks bye",

Hearing older people say they hate their office job makes me really sad for my future. The thing that makes me feel depressed is being stuck in a 9-5 job that I hate just to make a living, not my phone. My phone is a distraction from all the depressing things happening in the world. The phone isn't the problem\n\nEDIT: I'm not saying that phones help EVERYONE, I'm just expressing how it has helped me and my opinion on the things stated in the video. The internet and the youtubers I watch have really helped me cope. Being suicidal, I've made lists of reasons to stay alive, and one of my reasons was the fact that if I kill myself, I will never be able to watch TMG, Shane Dawson, David Dobrik etc again. Yes, I'm aware that it's not the best thing to do as a way to cope and I should get therapy, but at the moment I can't access any form of therapy.  Also I'm in no way saying I have depression, I should have used better language in my comment, but the future, desk job etc (what I stated before) makes me feel very hopeless and sad and the phone/internet helps me cope with those emotions.",

But music really really helped me, so I must thank the internet because without music I don't know where I'd be, and I'd never truly know what I wanted to do with my life. I would never have fallen in love with music without the internet, since I wasn't that interested in it until I found this girl called Melanie Martinez. At that point I had never cared much about music before, and I started using spotify which allowed me to get more into bands like muse, green day, mcr and a lot more (which I used to hear on the radio from time to time). I found more solo artists and more bands and I was great. This wouldn't have happened without the internet, so I guess the internet made me less depressed.",

I'm in the middle of the millennials group and I see so much drive, tenacity, and desire to individualize their life experience in this group. Gen Z and beyond are going to usher in a wave of customization in ways we could not have fathomed 20 years ago. They are really special and I'm glad to share space in this life with them!\n\n\nI would like to see more research on biology and neurology relating to this group. I feel like there are more gen z children born with some form of autism or food intolerance than any other generation. Can we also get studies showing how many gen z children grow up having to take antidepressants and other mood altering substances compared to other gen groups? There is something odd about the health of this generation. I feel like psychological, neurological, and developmental issues are on a strong upward trend :(",

First of all, I was born in 2001 and find that I have nothing in common in my childhood with those born anywhere near 2012, because I was already in middle school. Also, continuing to say that social media and phones wreck our generation is so confusing, because \"Gen Z-ers\" did not invent all of these things. We were raised with millennials and Gen X giving us technology and social media. If people over the age of 40 want to continue to say we are \"ruined\", they should consider WHO RUINED US IN THE FIRST PLACE. Children don't have access to advanced technology without being enabled by their parental figures. Every generation is a product by those that came before them. We are raised in a world that has been changed by people who lived prior. It's not like our generation is obsessed with technology because we wanted to be. Parents now give their kids iPads so they don't have to worry about them, as opposed to giving them creative outlets or encouraging them to advance their talents or finding new passions or simply playing outside! I myself was not raised like that - I played outside every single day and didn't have a phone until I started high school. We were not born with smart phones in our hands, we were enabled and encouraged the have the newest technology.",

But there are some differences between my brother and I technology wise, time spent on social media, etc... I think the 96‚Äô- early 00‚Äôs range is just an awkward in between because technology was there, but not everyone had it.. I would say growing up wise, I relate more with millennials, but I was able to watch social media as it developed. I still remember when Instagram was brand new and when Snapchat was created... I still grew up with social media, it was just new and not nearly as popular as it is now.",

Mellenials all were born and mostly raised in a time of plenty early and so feel entitled and also later in life or upon adulthood a time of economic hardship that was heavily blamed on corruption or the capitalist system failing and so either don't trust the current economic system or the politicians and so believe the mostly progressive media that was required to cite sources when they were younger and so along with their common economic beliefs, they believe that social liberty is gone/eroded by older generations moving far too traditional that they believe restrict them -- often missing that currently politics have undergone a massive propaganda campaign for years and starting with mellenials is the first generation of people that mostly believe that part of each parties intent or principles aren't what they actually are, while baby boomers just have the highest amount of these people in a generation before, they confuse the two current parties when put into policy what the outcomes would be and sometimes even their principles, which is:\n\n\nThe propaganda has tricked those into thinking only the government can provide services to all people and convinces people they lack rights. And with heavy economic regulation far beyond increasing competition, they stamp out the ability of most average people of having the ability to work on their own and then lower their wages while working for a company by increasing the labor force with third world immigrants that don't benefit americans currently. Creating a situation where even more americans become dependent on them. This is the short version,",

    "commentText": "For SOME people, social media is linked with mental illness, but I hate that people link the growing rate of anxiety and depression with solely just technology. I believe that a big reason there is much more anxiety and depression within the younger generations is because of how the education system is changing. College used to be a place you could go to FURTHER your education if you wanted to better yourself and to get a better job. Now, college has basically become a necessity: if you don‚Äôt want to work at fast food forever and live in a shitty apartment and live in poverty, you HAVE to go to college. It‚Äôs so much harder nowadays to find a steady job without a college education. Plus, on top of that, college puts people into a lot of debt, because it‚Äôs becoming more expensive and they can‚Äôt afford it, but they NEED it. I feel like because of this, the schooling systems as a whole have really amped things up, specifically high school, and that‚Äôs why we are seeing a lot more teenagers who struggle with anxiety and depression: not because they‚Äôre lazy conceited idiots who are on their phone all the time, but because, I don‚Äôt know, maybe pressures are growing and growing. I hate when older generations just blame everything on younger generations, instead of looking at how they‚Äôve changed the culture themselves. EVERY generation has changed things, for better AND for worse.\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk lol",

        "commentText": "to me, the strange part is how people presume that they can tell an entire generation what they're all about, even tho the oldest are only twenty-three and the youngest are six.   it's a little soon to put Zers into a box.\nalso strange:  why 1995 and 2012?    who gets to determine that boundary and why?\nthe stereotyping of a generation comes more from defining events experienced during their formative years:  great depression in 1930s,  ww2 in 1940s, korean war, large scale prosperity and economic growth, vietnam, energy shortages, mariel boatlift, iraq vs kuwait, arrival of dial up internet + brick phones, later arrival of broadband + social media + smart devices, 9/11, 2008 crash, michelle obama school lunches, and so on.  \nin the context of being in middle school during 2008 crash: a kid then would remember how their' parents were suddenly out of work or losing their homes.  even if they were a \"rich kid\", they saw it happen to others.   seeing entire neighborhoods of houses under construction become a no mans land after being suddenly abandoned.  coming home famished after school cos the obama lunches were both tiny and disgusting.\nshit like that during the formative years is, well, formative.  particularly when it's nationwide or worldwide.  \nit's entirely too soon to \"define generation Z\", yet those middle schoolers  i mention?  as adults in 2038, they'll base their actions/decisions on finances/work/voting/schooling/house/their own children partly on that 08 crash + obama lunches.  and someone of the same age, who is an otherwise complete stranger from across the country, will nod in agreement.\nthat nationally formative commonality relating to specific years is how generations get their specific traits that we observe as 'stereotyping'.\nremember: stereotypes would not come about if they were not at least partly true",

I've grown up being told that hard work is of utmost importance - and this wasn't necessarily from my parents or anyone specifically, I was telling myself that. I deduced that from my surroundings, which as the Generation Z in the video said, wasn't the prettiest. I also agree with the demolition of a physical office - I'm an online high school student and it has been wonderful. I don't have summer breaks and I don't take days off per se, I emulate what the author said in the video. My \"work and life\" so to speak is completely blended, and although I get stressed out with deadlines, overall it seems much better than the older generations make studying or working out to be. I don't have a drivers license and I've been told I'm the most productive and hardworking young person people have met. Change your ideas, change your life. You don't have to follow what everyone says you have to do, mainly because most of society is idiotic anyway.",

This is the second death.\n15¬†And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\n\n1) GOD loves you and has a plan for you!\n\nThe Bible says, ‚ÄúGod so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, [Jesus Christ], that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life‚Äù (John 3:16).\n\nJesus said, ‚ÄúI came that they may have life and have it abundantly‚Äù ‚Äî a complete life full of purpose (John 10:10).\n\n2) Here's the problem: man is sinful and separated from GOD.\n\nWe have all done, thought or said bad things, which the Bible calls ‚Äúsin.‚Äù The Bible says, ‚ÄúAll have sinned and fall short of the glory of God‚Äù (Romans 3:23).\n\n¬†The result of sin is death, spiritual separation from GOD (Romans 6:23).\n\n¬†The good news?\n\n3) GOD sent HIS Son to die for your sins!\n\nJesus died in our place so we could have a relationship with God and be with Him forever.\n\n¬†\"GOD demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us‚Äù (Romans 5:8).\n\nBut it didn‚Äôt end with His death on the cross. He rose again and still lives!\n\n‚ÄúChrist died for our sins. ‚Ä¶ He was buried. ‚Ä¶ He was raised on the third day, according to the Scriptures‚Äù (1 Corinthians 15:3-4).\n\nJesus is the only way to GOD. Jesus said, ‚ÄúI am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me‚Äù (John 14:6)\n\n4) Would you like to receive God‚Äôs forgiveness?\n\nWe can‚Äôt earn salvation; we are saved by GOD‚Äôs grace when we have faith in HIS Son, Jesus Christ. All you have to do is believe you are a sinner, that Christ died for your sins, and ask HIS forgiveness. Then turn from your sins‚Äîthat‚Äôs called repentance. Jesus Christ knows you and loves you. What matters to HIM is the attitude of your heart, your honesty. We suggest praying the prayer below to accept Christ as your Savior.\n\nPRAY NOW\n\n\"Dear God, I know I‚Äôm a sinner, and I ask for your forgiveness. I believe Jesus Christ is Your Son. I believe that He died for my sin and that you raised Him to life. I want to trust Him as my Savior and follow Him as Lord, from this day forward. Guide my life and help me to do your will. I pray this in the name of Jesus. Amen.\"",

We are in that transition from Y/millennials to Z. We're on the cusp or like hybrids. People don't understand that we're not part of either generation. We don't relate completely to millennials but we don't relate completely to Gen Z either. I would say that our childhoods felt more millennial like but since our teen years up to college when social media came up the culture has felt more Z like. My opinion though. A 1996 born with older cousins or older siblings might feel like they relate more to millennials, but a 1996 born with younger cousins or young siblings might feel like they relate more to Z. It varies from person to person.",

It was ridiculous, unrealistic, and unproductive.\n\nIf I do ever get back on those platforms, it's going to be solely for the social aspect: keeping up with family and the friends I actually talk to, not trying to get likes to make me feel like I belong.

The kid talking in the video demonstrates the I-gen person perfectly....selfish, self involved, delusional, incredibly self important and entitled. I work with these guys all the time. I have for a while now...both I-gens and millennials. Now, with full disclosure, I work almost exclusively with male models. So their world view is very skewed. They won the genetics lottery in many ways...looks....height...athleticism....muscle mass. I am with these guys for 8 to 12 hours a day. Now you have to separate the entitlement that is innate with the super good-looking and that of the I-gens. This is what I see daily. They are incredibly selfish. They are incredibly shallow. They do not make friends or develop  attachments very well at all. They are very good at putting on a show to get what they want. The fearless thing is ridiculous. I have never seen a group of people more skittish than these guys.  Maybe fearless in a video game, maybe that is what the kid meant. They all feel like they should get the best job or top pay. They are incredibly needy. We have to remember these kids were given trophies for showing up. We also have to remember they were reared by grandparent parents. Most of my guys, ages 18 to mid 20s, have parents in the late 50s to 60s. Ok the other thing about caring and being politically involved is silly. They have been brainwashed all of their finite lives by leftist ideological propaganda in the public schools. If asked to spend a dime of their own money they will heartily decline but will vigorously advocate for the government to steal money for others to accomplish what they feel is right. They are not realistic at all. Well that is if you are talking about actual reality. Again they have a pie in the sky attitude about life. Yes they will definitely change the world. Yikes!",

Different morals stemming from a different worldview than the Victorians, perhaps, but enforced just as sternly in an authoritarian manner. Kids love to rebel against adults like that, so it's not surprising if they're rejecting them in a way (mostly by poking fun at them), though thankfully they seem to still be embracing the good things our society has made progress in like tolerance and equality, just with a more positive, hopeful, grounded outlook.\n\n\"Table legs are offensive and must be covered up\"\n\"Milk is racist\"\n\nYeah, objects are not the same as the things they remind you of. We have the actual, more serious things to worry about here, and that seems like a petty distraction from them.",

What people don't understand is that you can't just draw lines between generations because every birth year will have slightly different experiences. You were born in 96 meaning most of your childhood and adolescence was in the 00s whereas I was born in 2002 meaning my early childhood was in the 00s. Therefore we will have similar experiences during that time period, not the same because we were different ages. It's important to clarify that I didn't have a smartphone growing up, we had internet but I hardly used it. Many people think our age group grew up with smartphones but that is not the case. Anyway, my point is that there will be differences between each age group but I have more in common with your childhood than other childhoods, they aren't the same but they aren't that different.",

North Korea, Trump, abortion, having the stress of picking up the messes of other generations. Maybe talk to actual members of gen z instead of having members of different generations define us. We should have the power to define ourselves.",

As an art student as well as a chemistry student, I really wanted to make computer graphics. Using the mainframe, my senior computing project was a graphics program to plot a titration  (acid/base) curve. I always hated drawing graphs that would go straight off the end of the page! The the internet and the world wide web came about when I was in grad school. Very helpful stuff! Anyway, I'm savvy because I fooled around with all this stuff back then and I never stopped playing with my toys. Devices, sure I can do that. But the culture surrounding the gens and their toys is something else again. That's what I need to learn from them and I am starting to pay more attention. Now as far as dealing with devices, how do people walk and text? That is a skill developing now for the future!",

But we‚Äôre still hanging out. We talk in group chats about books we‚Äôve read or sports or school and anything that we‚Äôd talk about in person. We still meet up in person too. Currently I‚Äôm on a vacation and my friends and I are hanging out when I get back so I can give them the things I got them. You can even argue that being connected online lets us hang out more. Lots of teens like to text their friends late at night. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre having virtual sleepovers. Or if we‚Äôre in school and someone has lunch during the others free period we can still hang out. We overall still hang out with our friends.",

(Raise your hand if you'd rather not have a job with full benefits and a livable salary that's 9-5, and instead work two part-time jobs and drive for Uber, without benefits, job security, or a predictable schedule that you can fit hobbies and friends into?  Anyone?  No?)\nI also disagree with the \"developmental trajectory\" being slowed down for recent generations.  We're not hitting the traditional milestones at the same pace of previous generations, but that doesn't mean we're more immature or inexperienced as a whole.  I actually think that kids today are exposed to important and mature issues earlier than in the past.  Younger generations are just prioritizing those traditional milestones at different times, due to preference or necessity.  High schoolers not having part-time jobs probably has less to do with immaturity and more to do with the crazy high demands of college admissions.  If you're doing 3 AP classes and 4 extra-curriculars, where would you even find time for a job?",

I personally, didn't get my licence until I was 19 because I couldn't afford it,  I'm 21 now and only decided to purchase a car because even though I live in a large city, public transport is not reliable, with what would normally be a 15 minute car drive to where I work sometimes lasting up to an hour in transit.",

I remember hanging out with friends at dinners, playing soccer/ sports in the early am, visiting families open house, working in warehouses etc. pretty vividly until the last few years of HS and then college. The U.S is pretty digitally driven amongst the youngsters and its pretty unhealthy at the way they consume it. Unnecessary conflicts arise through social media and then brought into real life. Talking about interconnection, yeah, teenagers are pretty connected in the realm of the internet but in real life, definitely not. A lot of teens 'fight/argue' online but in real life do nothing and want pretty much everything. Yes, with the recent news and everything, teens are definitely doing something, but those only represent the small percentages in the news and not the other large percentage of teens existing in the country. But then who knows, I may be wrong.",

I remember when the first smartphone came out it was blackberry it was not even touch screen. I remember it was big deal and going through the mall people fucking with it. I also remember when the Iphone rollout also Samsung smartphones. I think kids born from like 2005 to 2006 only know a life with smartphones. I do feel like the 2000's it change the way we live. after 9/11, Internet getting more popular, the wars. 2000's did change america in a big way. It just frustrates me that they said zGen live with smartphone. NO! most of us seen the changes. Kids from 1995 to 2004 seen what happen to changes are living. that what the message should have been.",

Hate being compared to the kids today considering I know MY childhood was spent at least 90% outdoors camping, catching bugs and animals (i liked catching things as a kid), playing games like tag, ‚Äòkick the can‚Äô, manhunt with my brother and neighbors, going on ‚Äúadventures‚Äù, etc, all without even owning a cellphone. Sure we had the tv and old computer that we could occasionally use (after asking permission) for maybe an hr if we did our chores or homework, but you bet your ass if it was a nice day we‚Äôd get kicked off the tv or internet to go play outside. Or maybe someone would need to make a phone call and that awful dial-up would kick you off anyway. Not going to deny i‚Äôm gen z if that‚Äôs a fact, but I still don‚Äôt like being lumped in with the kids born in the 2010s or late 2000s who were literally born into technology, while in 95 the internet was still just getting its footing.",

I also see the fact that with the end of the older generations such as The Greatest Generation all through the Baby-Boomers and Gen X, that there is going to be a massive shift in what we define as 'normal' especially in America. You look back to the 50s and you see a predominantly white culture based off values of tradition, or keeping older values. When you look nowadays at Millennials and members of my own generation, you see a drastically different setting that's defined by multiculturalism and acceptance of one another. As such I firmly believe that in the coming years we're going to see a massive change in society and the social structure, that shown merely 5-6 decades ago would seem outlandish to someone raised in the culture of the 50s and 60s.",

        "commentText": "It's refreshing to see such insight in someone from my own generation younger than myself. (2001). As a whole our generation is actually more liberal than millennial's but is less inclined to support social justice. You see when you look at the hard facts on paper women have the same rights and privileges as men do and minorities have the same rights as white people do in the developed world (United States, Great Britain, France, Japan, South Korea, etc.). The differences we see between men and women in the roles they play are partly genetic and partly learned and while to some people that may be looked down upon or outright denied I believe in many ways femininity is a good thing. In the case of minorities the differences we see in their behavior are almost exclusively caused by their cultural background. In some cases the tolerance and multiculturalism supported by the developed world has resulted in conflict as the customs and beliefs of one culture are not compatible with the culture that accepts them. Rather than focusing on multiculturalism I believe we should follow the analogy of a melting pot as the United States is often referred to. Rather than dividing people into separate groups the cultures of the people that live there whether born there or having immigrated there should slowly coalesce peacefully combining elements of many cultures with people trying new things while not forgetting old traditions. The true strongest divider in the world is wealth though and the amount of money you possess or your family possesses can determine a lot more. I would like to go on but I need some sleep. It would be interesting to see what your opinions are.",

We did know life before the smart phones, we remember flip phones and talking on a landline with the chord, meanwhile my little sister (born in 2009) has always known tablets and ipads and has always had access to that kind of technology. So, I‚Äôm not really sure where 00 kids would land, but I definitely don‚Äôt think we all fit into the Gen Z mould, and I‚Äôve definitely noticed I fit in a lot better with older people than younger (people born 2002 and up), especially when it comes to stuff like social media, politics, etc",

It‚Äôs not your fault but your generations and the generations that surround it have been ruining our world for years now. Unfortunately the generations effect each other. You kids rely to much on technology and your minds takes in to much information. And you soon come to realize nothing can be done to fix it.and you are but a mear Speke in this world. We are all mindless zombies blinded by money and material possessions.\n\nMy belief is that if we take down governments and rid ourselves of a ridiculous currency system and rely on small communities to lead themselves with a trade based currency. We need to go back to living like natural humans. Hunting and tracking our food, instead of having to work a job to earn a price of paper that allows you to buy things that would normally come from the earth naturally. But all our natural resources have companies that control and run them now, and they make a killing off of selling what would normally be free. \n\nI want Gen Z to realize this and to fix it in the future. Or we will go down a long dark path of relying on the government and big business to keep us alive.",

While I choose to dream of a mud cabin in an empty wilderness, and nothing but me and nature going at it. \nAll the things I listed at first have been compromised, taken over. Television is used to distract and entertain and it cost money. Money is earned by working, houses are earned with money and phones are what connects us to other people or places where we can spend more money or waste more time watching television or working.\n\nWe all strive to have money? Why? Because it‚Äôs the key to happiness right? Wrong, it‚Äôs what our society has made to be important. If you all can‚Äôt see that we live unnaturally then I have no hope for gen Z. Because we will remain lost and slaved for the rest our lives. Break the system, raise an army to over throw government, why couldn‚Äôt we do these things? \nImagine a natural world where your entertainment is walking down to the lake to take in a real view, and not watch it on YouTube. Imagine instead of earning the money to buy the food, you had the ability to track animals and grow your own food on land that you own outright and don‚Äôt pay taxes on. \n\nSome of you would say this is a barbaric way to live.. and to that I say you are lost",

Kids born from 2000 on are a whole other story and can be safely classified as Gen Z. As for me, I was born in 1995 and I didn't have constant quick internet access up until I was 11 or 12, which makes a huge difference because that means I lived my entire childhood without social media and the internet in general. I had to learn the internet instead of growing up in it. Kids who were born in 2000 were only like 6 or 7 when the internet became big and that makes all the difference.",

It‚Äôs a lot easier to think without being on your phone because at least for me, my thoughts become less cluttered. One time I was visiting my fathers old roommate and my phone died so I ended up talking to the guys son and we had a little fling. If my phone didn‚Äôt die, I wouldn‚Äôt have even bothered to talk to him. I went to the movies without my phone and became observant of what was around me. As much you might hate it, your mental health does get better when you get off your phone. You learn that the media blows everything up, you meet people, you learn more about the world. I‚Äôm not saying get rid of it, but spend less time then maybe you‚Äôd realize ‚Äúwow the world isn‚Äôt too bad at all‚Äù. Social media influences us on what we should think and how we should act. In all falls into this toxicity of confusion and sadness since we practically have grown up with it.",

In 5-6 years we'll see what this generation is really made of. \n\nAnd I think our predictions are going to be entirely off the mark. There's something that a lot of studies are leaving out... The fact that \"minorities\" will be the majority of gen Z. It sounds small, but it's something huge that is overlooked by many. I find it amusing that few have linked the change in American culture with our changing demographics as a country. \n\nThis is why you see many \"status quo's\" already being challenged. America is literally changing and I think most people are ignoring the elephant in the room. We've reached the tipping point and it's going to be really interesting to see how quickly everything changes now.",

This also is one of the reasons why places like sweden and Japan are having severe birth crisis.

It's a silly notion, and even hypothetically speaking, if it were coming to an end it's certainly wouldn't be by force or some global conspiracy. The fact that white families have fewer children isn't the fault of any other race. Nor is the fact many choose to marry interracially. Many of the world's most powerful countries are majority white ...i'd say it's one of the last races to worry about extinction. Many tribal races are definitely dying out. \n\nNow if your concern was a loss of power... that's a fair argument.",

Those predictions were made when a liberal, progressive leader was in power, and often times, the younger generations act out against the ideals of who is in power. But with Trump, who's a complete 180, I think we might just see them swing the other way. \n\nHaving just graduated high school, the reaction my fellow classmates had to the current political climate was immense, and for the most part, rather progressive in ideology. Walkouts, speeches, protests. And that's just one high school in a sleepy western Iowa suburb. Had Clinton been elected president, perhaps we would've seen a shift to the right.

For instance, I have a Catholic friend who gave up her social media for Lent. And halfway through this, I got a message from her telling me how difficult it was to give it up because she had to receive messages from other people through social media, particularly for school. She wanted to disconnect completely, but without accessing her social media she was missing out on a lot of important things in her life. And that‚Äôs something I feel like other generations don‚Äôt necessarily realize. In some ways, the new technology gets to a point where the youngest generation can‚Äôt operate without it if they want to make and maintain connections in their age group.",

Windows 10 has a processing and memory footprint at least several times greater than Window XP... but how much MORE can I actually do with it than I did with XP? \n\nI had to upgrade from my 1st gen iPad mini because I couldn't even surf the internet with it anymore. Websites are so bloated with extraneous scripts and advertisements, my browser would frequently run out of memory and freeze or crash just trying to do routine business. Furthermore, many essential apps were barred from me because they did not support the old version of IOS. So all that extra processing power we love to praise isn't really improving our productivity at all - it is simply in an arms race with the software environment it needs to support.\n\nAnd no, technological advancement is NOT independent of the economy nor does technology inevitably improve. It is in fact DEPENDENT on a good economic environment and a a stable, prosperous society. Just ask the people living in political chaos and poverty for a thousand years after the economic and military collapse of Roman civilization if technology always improves.",

I'm still in high school, but I really hate going to work at shitty jobs like fast food, although I also recognize I could just not work until I need to, but I like money. I've just thought, though, if I were to have to keep doing a shit job for the rest of my life, I'd rather kill myself than just live depressed. I don't really mind working in an organization, but it's just that I fear not being able to afford college to get a job that I want, thus trapping me to stay poor because I wasn't born into wealth or comfort. Seeing my mom living paycheck to paycheck has given me so much desire to escape from the trap of poverty, but our society and majority of current lawmakers that want to keep medicine and postsecondary education based on making money only fill me with a view of a bleak picture for other people of my generation who were not born with such affluence. All I just want to do is help people and teach others, but I don't want to have to go into debt just to be able to do that. Life really sucks and the future is full of uncertainty.",

Every generation is increasingly more and more racially diverse, which is why the Boomers struggle to understand how the status quo is changing.",

Also, statistics show a child's occupation is now more than ever dependent on whatever occupation their fathers was. Generation Z has been born into a caste system and doesn't even know it.",

But remember, children aren't born with a smartphone in their hand. Children need parents to raise them and teach them how to act, so don't hand your kid a phone and complain about how they spend too much time on there phone. There are teenagers, like me, who are living amongst these gen Zs and millennials but have no part in it. I am 16, I have no social media other than YouTube, I read books, I work full time and go to school, I drive a manual car. I'm not boastling in any way, but I am ultimately thankful to the discipline my parents, mainly my dad, installed in me at a young age. I'm glad that at 16 I have the job experience of most 30 year olds, I'm glad that I worked for every cent of my car. Remember that kids will be however you raise them, I'm glad to have had an amazing dad.",

I'm far more on conservative's side, but I still don't agree with them. I used to. I used to be very for equality of opportunity until I realized it's nonsense. You can have MORE equal opportunity in CERTAIN settings. But in many settings, and definitely in an overall setting, it's undesirable. It's anti-freedom once again. Some parents want to choose to give their kids a good life, other parents want to work incredibly hard to give their kids the best of the best, as I do. I don't want my kids to have equal opportunity as some other families who worked half as hard as me. That's not just nor free. Besides parents, people are born with other things that cause natural unequal opportunities such as attractiveness, athleticism, intelligence, personalities. (Yes you can gain those things, but you are born with a certain level, and that is inherently unequal from the start.) People have unequal opportunities because of these things. If we were to give equal opportunity based on these, we would have to STOP valuing them, and pretend everyone is the same. And I think that's very bad. Like I said in certain settings one or more of those qualities I mentioned won't matter as much, so it can be more equal there, but hopefully it will never be that much, and luckily it's impossible to ever be, because that would be the death of freedom, variety, different strengths, and really anything interesting.",

That's the way it should be. You're right about the thing with more male engineers for example, but if a male is born with an IQ ten points lower than another guy, he will have to study more and work harder than the other guy. Or if the guy was born a bit more gifted in mathematics. That's not an equal chance. You have to work harder for your chance. It's ok though because I think most people who are for equal opportunity really aren't. I think they just mean everybody CAN do it IF you work harder than the guy who was born having to work less for it. But that's obviously not equal at all so I think conservatives' use of the word \"equality\" is pandering to how far left the political \"center\" has gone. There are only certain situations where money for example shouldn't matter as much and more equal chance would be nice (like in school or sports), but money will always matter and to say otherwise just means you have to stop valuing capitalism or money and its worth at all. Everyone has the chance to work hard to earn money so it works fine.",

Beyond that it's up to you to earn whatever you can. We already have equality of opportunity. Somebody with 10 less IQ points has no less opportunity than somebody smarter, they just have to work harder but they still have the same opportunity. You're talking about equality of outcome.

To me it seems if someone is born smarter their opportunities are not equal to someone who is less smart. The only equality in their opportunity is that they both have an opportunity. That's it. If by equal opportunity you mean \"everyone can IF they work different levels according to what they have to do\" then of course... but that's barely \"equality\" and my main point was that it seems like the phrase equality of opportunity was made to pander to leftists who yell at conservatives for being against typical equality. We're saying the same thing other than that. When I said equality is bad I was just talking about equality in general... not a certain specific type of justified equality. Lots and lots of people still want more equality in general that's what I was against.",

I wouldn't say we're more conservative, but a good portion of us are rather libertarian. Whether this division in politics and sociability is a harbinger of worse things to come, only time will tell, but it's somewhat unnerving. For instance, today I was evoked my privileges of using our school laptops forever because I made a (respectful) survey about one of our P.E teachers, asking students what they thought of him, in which many of the respondents criticised him for valid reasons. I got in trouble for \"slandering\" him, as some of the questions had \"negative connotations\" which could promote \"harassment and bullying.\" God, do I hate our pathetically sensitive education system. I don't really blame the punishment, the principals were just performing their jobs, but the fact that they're afraid of parents or other people giving them legal issues over things such as a damn survey bewilders me, really. I would think a grown adult could handle some criticism, especially a teacher. When I was trying to explain some of the questions might seem inherently negative because I was trying to collect data from students who thought of his class negatively, the vice principal told me she took \"analytics\" classes, and said my questions were too focused on the negativity aspect. That might have been the case, but for Christ's sake, I'm 14! Sorry I didn't waste my time going to a college course about collecting and analyzing data. It's just completely silly.",

All \"atheism\" channels of 2012-2015 suddenly converted into \"SJW hate\" channels, and that transition is very sad. The \"SJW hate\" phase is something that feeds perfectly into teenage angst/hormones as it feeds a need to put others down. This makes Gen Z currently a prime target for these videos. The dangerous biproduct of this is when some viewers associate the whole left with SJWs. \n\nAnyway, the words \"SJW\" and \"PC\" shouldn't even have a negative connotation, but the right wing internet successfully brainwashed those words to be insults.  To advocate social justice is to advocate equality, no matter what a few whackjobs have you believe. And to be politically correct is to be polite, although there are extreme exceptions which everyone finds annoying. \n\nAnd for the record, I'm Gen Z although i'm within the awkward half-decade from 1995-2000, so i'm not some \"millennial whining\"",

Liberalism is bad, because it makes it hard to have an opinion of your own. Liberal thinking has become a necessary thing to be considered a decent person. Don't get me wrong, you can be a classical liberal or at least not a hardcore liberal, but if you look at the movement itself (a. k. a. SJWs) you'll see that it's highly illogical, depends on feelings alone and can actually become so intolerant and straight up aggressive, that the people don't seem liberal at all anymore. That certainly doesn't characterise every liberal, but that is what drives liberalism and every sub-movement it has, like feminism and LGBT+. The thing is, if you don't actually research the political or philosophical movement you identify with, you can end up being simply brainwashed and as a result say a lot of stupid stuff. Because every real movement is interested in adding new members, therefore it's not unbiased, it doesn't give you freedom. That's why calling yourself a feminist and reciting a bunch of repeated phrases doesn't do any real good for the world, only create an illusion that people are fighting for the right thing. But who said changing the world for the good is easy?\nBasically, modern liberal ideology makes you blind. Because any ideology makes you blind. And I actually never specified that the 'healthy thinking' part is about conservatism or republicanism. Liberalism is the opposite to healthy thinking nowadays because it is currently dominating mainstream media. These days if you want to be seen as progressive you absolutely have to be a liberal. Only, truly progressive thinking can never be dominant in society. You have to risk being offensive by saying new stuff, if you want to actually move society forward. Liberals don't want you to understand that.",

Like the millennial teachers I have all really do seem to believe in that social justice warrior politically correct crap. Most of us Gen Z all realize that the political correctness has gone way overboard, and now we treat it like how people treated the social expectations of conservative etiquette a few decades ago. Essentially being politically correct is the new \"show some manners\" but now it's coming from the left instead of the right, and instead of being anti-rocknroll and anti-sex, its anti-cultural appropriation, and anti-microaggressions. They're all equally bullshit. We definitely are socially liberal, and our stance on gun issue seems to be pretty left (although since we also know nothing about guns that aren't on our xbox, our ideas for gun reform amount to banning the machine gun 1007 which killed about 3.5 people this year, while leaving machine gun 1-1006 as the same) we are more fiscally conservative however, and our attitude on foreign policy is basically\n1. Let's make friends with everyone through diplomacy and trade, always trying to avoid war.\nAnd \n2. As long as no part of Mohammed Ahtmu lands on my shirt after the drone strike, the war on terror is just a part life (or death) \nAnd we don't seem to care/know too much about the constitution.\nWe also aren't foaming at the mouth like Democrats are about Trump. Most of what Trump does we either laugh at, see as just some far away policy from D.C. that won't effect us, or don't know and don't care. And we don't seem to want Washington to be involved in our daily lives, we don't really trust them and see them as usually ineffective. Generally though you can still feel the inclination towards the left within Gen Z, but maybe that's more just me since I do live in silicon valley where everyone is already liberal. Any Gen Z out there who live in more moderate areas.",

Conservative for our generation isn't the same as conservative for our parents or grandparents. The idea remains the same, but the world changes. Right now young conservatives are mostly a reaction to liberalism being overrated among \"progressive\" people. It only means that we chose to look at things from a more mature, experienced worldview. Of course, we are all trying to be smart, but it only makes sense to become more conservative when you see the world becoming too liberal. We are old enough to be interested in politics and young enough to be dissatisfied with the way our world is ruled. So, if you think about it, conservatives that we need today are not at all the conservatives we all know from childhood. And, the liberals, that we all consider ourselves to be, are not at all that progressive anymore. With that logic, \"liberal\" is the new conservative, and \"conservative\" is the new progressive. And, by the way, if you haven't thought about it, the world will always be devided into conservative and liberal. Our biggest priority is not to choose either side, but to seek balance between the two. We have to learn from each other and learn to compromise in order to preserve peace.",

The most important thing about generations is technological advancement and world events within a certain time period and how your affected.

In 2 years the first kids who were born after 9/11, to whom it is only history they learned about, are gonna be turning 18 and becoming productive members of society. For Millennials 9/11 was a big historical event and had i just been a year younger i probably wouldnt have even been old enough to accurately remember where i was during 9/11. My 2nd grade classroom. The teacher had the lights off and the news on. We spent the day watching the twin towers falling on repeat. A couple kids were crying but i didnt really know what was happening.

Hell, I was born in 2001 and no one in my house even used Internet at home until I was at least 4 or 5. Not to mention, generations are based off of generational markers, not off of one event. American Gen Z markers are generally 1. Growing up with President Obama. 2. Most of our lives have been spent post 9/11 3. Smart Phone boom (among others). There are plenty of other markers that are more specific to international events that all happened in a similar time frame to these, and there are more markers happening as time goes on. The idea is that each generation experiences events similarly to their generation mates, but very different from other generations. This is why 1995, '96, and even '97 babies would likely fit better with millenials than Gen z.",

I can see it with my own eyes. We were not centered around technology as kids, these kids are always on their technological devices. Life was different for us. Even the cartoons we watched, it's like everything has changed. Either 1995-2005 is a short generation of its own, or Generation Z itself has two different stages. In addition, both of my parents are Generation X. There is a flaw in the Generation timeline. I usually put those born before 2005 in the late Millenial stage. Though our experiences are still different from other Millenials, its closer to them than Generation Z. Comparing someone born in 1989 to someone born in 1999, there are noticable differences, but not that much. However, someone born in 1999 and someone born in 2009 have a much bigger gap. Significant differences where you can tell they aren't from the same generation. Therefor I go back to my original statement. Either 1995-2005 is another generation its own, or its some sort of transition stage between Millenials and Generation Z (which basically would make it another short generation).",

I personally believe generation Z started in 1995 with the advent of the internet and ended with the mass popularity of smartphones around 2008-10.",

I was born when he was 31 years old in 1995, I wasn't allowed to use the family computer until much later but I had internet access at school when I was in 1st grade back in 2002, though there's not much to see...

Worldwide abject poverty of just $1 a day is down from 50% of the global population to 10% in just the last 10 years! I mean, that's pretty much the best news in the history of the human species, but it isn't talked about. Meanwhile bad news has increased over the last 100 years. We're subjected to more bad news now than during the great depression or WWII which are definitely worse worlds than we live in today.\n\nSo my recommendation is the next time you see someone complaining about how bad something is, take a step back, put that aside for a little while and ask \"Is that happening here, right now?\" If it's not, try changing it to something happening in some mysterious place, or in another time. Remember it for when you need it to make decisions, but let yourself be where you are and enjoy it if it's not so bad.",

I don‚Äôt think adults fully understand how much more stressful school is now than it used to be. Never before was it an expectation that we take multiple college level courses this year. As a freshman, I was in 4 fully weighted courses (one was AP, one was PLTW, one was honors precalculus, and a high level performing arts course), and 2 partially weighted honors courses. Only one of my classes was at regular weight. As a sophomore I‚Äôll be taking 5 AP courses. On top of that I‚Äôm expected to be involved in so many extracurriculars. And all around me I see people who are even more involved, who push themselves even more than me. I started social media pretty late as well. Sure I‚Äôve been more anxious and stressed since then, but that‚Äôs because it corresponded to a much heavier course load compared to previous years. I think for most teens, we turn to social media because we are stressed not the other way around.",

You suddenly got defensive, and totally forgot the context of the conversation. Also \"By the way no one cares if generation z has made some products every generation does it's part of growing up.\n\". Your english comprehension is HORRIBLE. That is NOT what it means. It means that GenZ has the tools, and currently are using them, to be entrepreneurial in a way no other generation has, and that they are ALREADY proving this prediction. They are selling products, as in an item, themselves, films, or etc, at a very young age in a successful matter that influences the social media landscape or etc. Are you jealous? No one is discounting Millennials here. Gtfo if you cant have a constructive argument.",

I'm nowhere near perfect but I am more self aware plus more caring and I think that is key. I think diversity is important.  Believe in what you want to believe,  even if that means not believing in anything at all. I just think the Bible is placed as a guideline but so many people misinterpret it and instead use it as an excuse to be evil instead of the good it was meant for. I'm a millennial by the way.  =)",

Meaning that we were blamed for stuff even before we got into the working world.   And the whole hippie generation we were blame for was actually caused by the younger baby boomers themselves (got that from my high school baby boomer born teacher).  Of course, we were a whiny generation, I agree, but I call BS in that we didn't work as hard as other generations before. \n\nYour last sentence makes zero sense.  We fell for their lies because those lies were true for them.  Back in the day jobs did value their employees and they retain them.  However, now a days they don't invest in their employees and want to save their dollars by downsizing.  And having an education does mean you will get a job like you did back them.  Yet they don't take the time to update their brains to this knowledge.  \n\nAll the debt that the country has accumulated was thanks to the baby boomer generation not wanting to boost the future generation up like the silent generation and the generation before that did.  I have been paying for THEIR social security when I was previously working, but of course I will never get that social security when I retire.  Yet Gen Z, assuming its your generation, will most likely be lucky in that you won't be paying into a system that won't be their anymore.  Gen Y hasn't done jack to Gen Z, and Gen Z's university tuition problem isn't our fault its the baby boomers.",

I'll pay into the current corrupt system as little as possible, as I'm currently living Nomadic, and plan to do Permaculture.\nI don't think we should stop developing more technology, but I think we should structure our society in the way that we start living in pact with nature again, rather than creating wasteland wherever we go.\n\nWhen I write (((Them))) I mean the factions of corrupt elitists who compete for power, and who abuse our civilized society, to domesticate people through indoctrination in schools, media, etc. The American constitution were originally created to protect \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\", and I don't think either Capitalism nor Socialism represents that today. Both have been infected by the factions of corrupt elitists, and no matter which one you vote for you loose, and the elitists win.\n\nSo I think it's much better to take your life into your own hands, and live naturally, rather than contributing to a society which destroys our very foundation for life.",

        "commentText": "First of all, Left wing Millennials in general tend to promote this unhealthy idea of \"whoring\" around due to the sexual liberation idea of the 3rd wave feminism. The feminizing of men and \"machoing\" of females will only deteriorate society since biologically, men tend to seek for young looking women (more fertile) and so, because of the multiplicity of partners and postponed marriage without settling down, the majority of Millennials today will find themselves \"lonely\" after their peak years pass away without a partner. Females tend to look for men who are confident due to the illusion that confidence correlates with power (better chance for protecting and providing for their children). So females tend to look for partners whom they think will be strong enough to raise their children. The feminization of males will only make men less \"attractive\" to females, thus reducing the number of successful relationships in the present. In addition, due to the late \"waiting\" of marriage and the probability of a female having already experienced multiple partners, the bonding effect caused by the release of chemicals after intercourse is severely reduced, making them less susceptible to successfully attract and keep men  more often. In addition, the loss of production of testosterone in males due to the lack of physical activities (excersising increases the production of testosterone) will only make them more unattractive for females and lose pheromones to attract females. In other words, there will be a lack of children in the future which means less revenue in taxes to pay for social programs such as welfare (especially since more people will be retiring without dying, and thus there will be a lack of money to pay for the pensions and social security for these people). \n\nUnderpopulation will be a severe crisis in the future in 1st world countries. Some people say that overpopulation is a problem... which indeed it is... in 3rd world countries, not in 1st world countries. So by not having children, these people in 1st world countries will eventually bring the demise of the US, Europe, and Asian countries (just look at Japan) while the nations with the most population will govern the world in politics, such as the Middle Eastern countries - Muslim nations - and India as well as other non-feminized men/non-machoed females nations. This defeats the whole purpose of progressive movement since those countries which will take the lead in the world tend to oppress minorities and hated opponents, such as in the Middle East (where rape is legal). Of course, some say China will take the place of US so maybe it will be influenced by it more, unless, of course, China's economy is unable to recuperrate from the financial crisis they are about to experience (a future Real Estate crash in the chinese market due to the dependency on Chinese's real estate government laws).\n\nThe point is that we need to act now if we want to prevent a catastrophy like this.",

        "commentText": "I admit, I over exaggerated the economic downfall of the world etc., but the unhealthy consequences done by today's \"progressive\" movement (I personally call it regressive) is a real problem. For example, due to them, they have achieved the reduction of time of \"recess\" in schools since they claim it is benefitial (more time in school) but it has been proven that recess time is actually very healthy for males since it gives them an opportunity to do physical activities and increase their production of testosterone in a healthy manner. Also, this helps \"control\" the children with ADHD more since it gives them a chance of exhausting that energy in playtime. Making them \"sit\" down for hours without breaks actually makes their symptoms worse. \n\nFemales, on the other hand, are encouraged recently by modern way feminists to pursue powerful activities and \"demonize\" any past female activities since according to them it only \"oppresses\" them. They discourage them from accepting common courtesy manners and indoctrinate them to fear men (this is an irrational fear). In fact, there was a study made which found that the main reason that females tended to avoid STEM fields even though they liked it was not due to opportunities in the field (they are encouraged actually), instead, they refused to join due to an irrational fear that they would be discriminated even though in actuality, it does not happens. When asked where did they heard these fake news (since STEM is actually very welcoming to females) they answered that they heard it from feminist propaganda. When you continuously repeat a lie, eventually, you will start to believe it, and this is just what happened in STEM. Feminist propaganda is the reason why there is a lack of females in STEM fields. \n\nAlso, the \"machoing\" of females only increases the testosterone in females which, by the way, a high level of testosterone in females gives them a higher risk for obesity, heart disease, and diabetes, thus, in the future, my prediction is that females will begin to die off younger than in previous generations. We still do not see this since today's older generation is composed of Baby Boomers which had, at least in the development in hormones, a healthy upbringing (not psychologically of course).",

But i do believe in letting myself cry it out and bc of this, i am able to maintain my own mood. When i am at work, my mind will start to randomly remind me of all the bad in my life so when that happens i start cleaning and humming a tune. To others it looks like im a perfectly happy person when in reality, im just dealing with my depression the best way i know how",

        "commentText": "krishna L rich kids depressed, poor kids depressed, we are all depressed. I think it's because of the unreal expectations put on us (my school is impossibly competitive, everyone's self medicating to deal with the stress). We are supposed to be the gen to make everything better, and yet I get told \"Y'all teenagers are so self righteous. You don't have to work for anything. Entitled brats.\" We live in a world of contradictions. Be idealistic. Dream Big. But we see all of those ideas fail and watch our parents and our friends parents lose their jobs and such. That's why we're realistic. We are more intelligent (average SAT scores increase yearly), but are constantly being told that we are dumb. And we inherited a world destroyed by the mistakes of others. Racism, sexism, homophobia, terrorism, global warming, gun violence, political corruption, social upheaval. All of that is why we are more fluid and accepting in our beliefs . If somebody is homophobic, they'd be the one I'd stare at in disbelief. Recycling is a thing at my school, and we are concerned over the environment and the humanitarian crisis. My friend group consists of whites, blacks, latinos, Asians, and Indians, and all I care about are their personalities and interests. Skin color has never been a factor for my gen. My friends are girls and boys. Some girls hang out with just guys and vice versa. Gender isn't a thing (like literally with transgender people on the rise) when picking friends. For me when has terrorism not been something to be scared about? I'm just as likely to get that here in America as I am in other countries. My first concert, I prayed that what happened in Vegas or Manchester would not occur there. My point is we are depressed, but it's not totally our fault. We get bad reps, unrealistic expectations, and no support which is why I believe we are depressed, yes, but are more than anything, independent, strong, and are going to make a difference in the way the world works.",

I'm part of generation Z  living in one of the most regulated places in the country, Bay Area (Silicon Valley) California, and it fucking sucks. Everything is way overpriced, and much of the decisions to what risk we want to take or what we want to buy are made by some of the most privelaged arrogant people. I've had multiple moments where my phone is about to die, so I decide to pick up a newspaper while I'm waiting  for something and every fucking time their is a story about how after 10 years of construction, going through every hoop to pass all the regulation, getting the approval from multiple government officials from different agencies, using all the right material that meets the environmental standards, and spendng millions of dollars on its construction, a building which was supposed create dozens of new jobs and make things easier for the consumer or set of desperatly needed new housing complex, gets blocked because some bitchy neighbor decided that he/she doesn't like the cars on the sidewalk or shape of the buiding, so compalins to the city counsel, and just like that, contruction is put to a halt, and another 2 years are added to the time table,  and when it does finally get completed, the business will often end up leaving because prices and taxes make more too expensive  make it less expensive to sell the place than actually trying to run the business. It took one year to build the empire state building, and now it takes 4-6 years just to build a new highway. The only businesses that thrive here are the tech companies, which have almost ZERO REGULATIONS. Meanwhile Housing is unaffordable here, and yet the state has rejected multiple bills to raise the height most our buildings are allowed to be, limiting the housing market even as our population grows and as a result, we some of the worst homelessness problems in the nation. Inefficient Regulation is also the reason drugs in this country are so goddamn expensive, because it takes 10 years for a drug to pass through the FDA, making impossible for anyone except Big Pharma to fund drug testing and studies, and then they reap all of the benefits by claiming ownership and raising the prices so high that most people can‚Äôt afford them, which they wouldn‚Äôt be able to do if our laws allowed drugs from other countries to enter. Crony Capitalism is destroying this country!",

        "commentText": "Yeah but we are different from the millennial style of liberals, I can tell from talking to the older guys (and especially the women) including our very young teachers that the millennials are way more sincere and genuine about their liberal beliefs, always trying not to offend people, really believing that everyone is truly good and innocent, and thinking that all we need to do is be kind and independent and celebrate our diversity in order to make the world perfect for everyone. Generation Z is more apathetic, most of us are part of the politically correct culture only in the formal sense, I.E. we all know that the when your talking to the class, at serious work meeting with the boss, or on camera, you talk very superficially  like a person on CNN, MSNBC, or a white house official from the Obama administration, making sure to note your tolerance and utmost desire to achieve whatever the goals are of the topic they are addressing at the mandatory presentation in the school auditorium - sexual abuse, alchohol, suicide. But once you leave you go back to your real self, swearing and with most students altering 0% of their attitude or beliefs, not even showing any signs that we just came from a presentation on a super depressing and serious topic except for the almost amused impressions at how we had to go to this lame assembly being led by people who actually think that they are going to change anything instead of just being some mandatory bureaucratic event that makes us (them) feel better and cover their asses. And for a noticable amount of people, there is even some resentment that we are basically being forced by our schools into an indoctrination assembly. This goes along with our rather low expectations of our current government (and I mean government in general, not just Trump) We also don't really feel invested in the successful ideal outcome of most movements. And even though most of generation Z naturally tilts left/liberal most of us are actually pretty accepting or at least used to of not very leftward policies and trends, like we don't get shocked or emotional about school shootings unlike our parents, we actually had a false alarm a month ago where the principal said someone with a gun was in our school, and to me at least it didn't seem particularly scary or dangerous, I figured it was most likely a false alarm, and even if it wasn't the chances of my class getting picked would be very small. Or the U.S war on terror and use of drones in Pakistan, most would probably say that we shouldn't be a as jumpy to launch a drone strike, and that it could do more damage than good in the long run;,  but almost all of us seem to accept it as something that is part of life (or an end of life for some Pakistanis) which we rarely have to think about. It's not that we don't have morality, it's just that what goes on in the middle East is so far away and doesn't really effect our daily lives, so whatever happens to the life of Mohammed Ahtmu in Pakistan or one of the other countries we are bombing really isn't one of our priorities. And as for Trump, although most of udissaprove of him like the rest of the younger generations, most of us aren't seething at the mouth like Democrats, we look at his policies or statements and mostly just laugh. Even even though there is definitely a PC culture, there isn't really a feeling of being pulled into the democratic camp or Republican camp, both are pretty lame to most people. We don't really trust the government to be effective, or efficient, or sincere, or to be able to make our lives that much better; our interest is in the tech companies and the idea of being the CEO of a startup company and going to a prestige university. Combine this lack of faith in the government, and this individualistic entrepreneur attitude, and I've actually found that at least in my experience, most of us can agree that although Bernie Sanders is cool and definitely has conviction and good intentions, we kind of agree that his expectations are unrealistic given the trouble we have with just trying to keep the government open. This is Not to say that we don't support the environment or think that it is necessary to do all that we can to save the earth and solve our problems, it's just were not really expecting to make big momentous gains or achievements that we will feel in our daily lives through most of these programs like preventing sexual assault, solving racial inequality, making things cheaper, cleaning the environment. We generally expect and accept mitigation, not revolution, although there are topics where we seem to think we will be able to make radical changes like gun control and immigration, but these are often the ones with the most vague goals and least understanding of the facts,  like knowing what makes a gun an assault rifle, that a pistol kills the most people in America, that the NRA is relatively tiny compared to big pharma, that there are very large parts of the country and public that will make it nearly impossible  for the House and Senate  to pass meaningful gun reform legislation. Or most of generation Z not knowing that being an illegal immigrants\n  can literally means being a second class citizens similar to the status of freed slaves after the civil war; that our immigration population as a percentage of our total population is at near historic heights; that this cycle of dealing with DACA kids and their parents will continue unless you have tougher immigration security; that if we were to make our immigration system more merit based and designed to include how well the immigrants would adapt and prosper in American society like Canada's system, we would have less people coming from Latin America and less family members and children, instead having more workers from Asia; and that as sad as the average life of refugee is, most of the Syrians aren't very tuned into western values like freedom of speech, women's rights, not being antisemitic, etc. I feel terrible for the Syrians and their situation, but instead of just listening to people who aren't experts talk on MSNBC, CNN, or Fox, I actually looked what the statistics are, what the mainstream beliefs of people in the region like Egypt, Jordan, lebanon and Turkey. What percentage of them say yes to imprisoning gay people for being gay, or say yes to killing people who leave their religion, or yes to women having unequal status under the law, etc. It's not just the fringe, and would probably cause even more Trump backlash in America if they were allowed to come in massive numbers, as has been the case elsewhere, so although though I don't agree with Trumps muslim ban, I do understand why some people are saying that we should let Europe handle the refugee crisis. And yet when I say this to my class citing ever statistic and its source, and only suggesting that we should be more cautious about the unamerican beliefs that are being held by the group than we normally would before we let them in, it's like they don't even hear what I'm just saying, and imagine that instead of having cited statistics with credible numbers about people from the region, they imagine that I had said that all Syrians are terrorist and suggest that the people in the surveys were lying about having dispicable beliefs and are actually very good people,  one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.  But overall Generation Z are like millennials in that we generally have the same inclinations and beliefs, however we are more individualistic and don't actually have as much faith in either the government's ir the excessive and annoying liberal social justice warriors. And there is definitely growing resentment over all this mandatory social justice programs and getting pretty tired of these unnecessary expenses like the new law in california that requires solar panels for all new homes.  If a significant portion of our generation were vote conservative, it would have to be after an aggressively overbearing and liberal leader and the emergence of a new conservative that would be libertarian on social issues, promise stability and clarity, points out all political bullshit and the ugly facts, promises to decrease the economic/government restraints, push the entrepreneurial spirit, stands out for his conviction and strong opinions, believes in science, and can appeal to the independents, think of someone with the balls of and style of Trump, the promises of Rand Paul, and the moderate appeal and politics of Bill Clinton.",

Youth is a wonderful yet limited gift. So once it‚Äôs gone, you wish you could go back to experience it. This is why I believe this sort of jealousy or spite is due to those currently experiencing that freedom and growth and wishing we could go back to those great times. Baby Boomers called Gen Xers slackers, Gen X called Millennials lazy and hooked on computers. And now most Millennials say similar to Gen Z. Maybe one day people will be more accepting of middle life and appreciate what comes after youth.",

We are constantly at pressure of being like somebody, following an ideal or creating something great. We just cant be satisfied with what we are and what we have produced through our work. \nI must say, that generation z is the one whose work is most highly viewed through fixed parameters of judgement. We just cant enjoy our work without caring about about how the authority will percieve it. Sure, we are encouraged to be entrepreneurial/creative, but we know that deep down, this encouragement is linked to economic or societal gains, thus eliminating the possibility of pure contentment due to the work we do. \nThis comment might seem like it wants to push forward a socialist agenda. And that is true. A society without a capitalist heirarchy is something we need, and we need it desperately.\nEven though it might logically seem like socialism doesn't work, but u can't deny that their is very little fulfillment in doing things just to satisfy some parameters on which u r being judged.\nThis is not simply because we dont like being judged. This is because we as human beings are biologically wired to overreach, to experience novelty, to be free.",

Sure, we are all thinking beings, and like to think highly of ourselves  but true satisfaction comes from being completely free and by completely immersing yourself in whatever you're doing and then reaching a certain depth of understanding in that work. This is where novelty/creative exploration/originality comes from. Current job market works the other way round; with an extremely certain result in mind: gains. But that is not what we really need when we look at humanity as a whole. We are conscious beings that can confront chaos and have the ability to jump right into the darkness and get highly valuable things from there. In other words, the purpose of consciousness is to explore, When u look at it from the core perspective. We get upset with ourselves when we are not doing it.",

Everyone who came to this peace of land of earth is on the same level, why not nationalize hard working professionals who want to seek the north American dream? Make it a place where only hardworking people deserve to live, those who put in the effort to make a good living, contribute to society, be a productive member of society, contribute to the overall betterment of the north American economy, where hard work, and only hard work is what defines the continent, away from religion and other stuff, and without pushing ideals and beliefs on others..... Lets face it, north America has no identity, it's not Europe, remember what Adolf Hitler tried to do, he wanted to nationalize the country and make it exclusive to the Aryan race in, while maybe the ways he took to achieve his goals were horrible, I kind of understand why he wanted to go this path, Europe is originally white, so it's only logical to put white people first......

I don't mean this in a rude or condescending way, but I think a lot of people in the western world don't understand it since we've been the freest in the world. Under socialism there is complete control over the economy, something that these \"socialist\" Scandinavian countries aren't doing. They allow elements of a free market, which isn't socialist. When people think of socialism the tend to think of social services really, and for the Scandinavian countries they do have more services, however they don't pay for a military because we are their protection. When you don't have to pay for your defence you can use a large amount of taxes for health care and etc. But these countries don't have nearly as good as health care as in the U.S.  because of our free market companies must compete to get business, so they need to lower prices, provide the best service, and innovate to stay in business. Socialism doesn't take that into account. When there is 1 force controlling a service they don't have to compete or innovate because they're the only service. Why make something more affordable or better when people will have to go to you by default? In fact doctors are leaving these countries because there's no incentive to be a doctor when you don't get paid much by the government, so these countries are now losing doctors. One of the appeals to that career is the money and without it what's the point of going through med school and going through all that effort. Another problem is that the  Scandinavian countries have a way smaller population. Truly socialist countries look like Venezuela, where the government took full control of their natural resources and made the prices extremely high, so no foreign people invested in it. There was no point in buying Venezuelan oil when you can get it somewhere else far cheaper. Also with a socialist government many people in the government don't understand economics. They spend way too much on social services. It's also harder for them to price things like food, because in a capitalist market the consumer sets the price based on demand, because of this companies try to meet the demand to get the customer. Thats what happened in China under Mao. Part of the 50 to 80 million deaths under his rule had to do with people starving to death for that reason. Another problem with socialism is that the government is pretty much the one making all decisions in your life. This greater good mentioned earlier sounds nice but it isn't. There isn't individuality. You may lose all your money because the government thinks its best going to someone else. That's theft. Taxes are government people coming to your house and taking money at gunpoint. If you refuse you go to jail or might be killed. So even in theory it's wrong because it isn't you deciding to give money for the good of humanity, it's the government stepping in and taking it from you whether you like it or not.  Basically I could argue that me taking your hard earned money is for the greater good because I'm hungry, which wouldn't be moral because it's your money and I have no right to take it. Lastly, socialism is not like democracy. True democracy is mob rule which never works because the ever changing will of the majority take the rights away from the minority. Socialism is government control of the economy. Anyways I know this is a long comment and if you read this far thanks for taking the time to read this. It would be interesting to possibly continue this discussion so maybe we can keep talking unless this is enough.",

That was him, a run of the mill Cuban speaking, not some propagandist working for the state. Now, I‚Äôm not saying I support socialism, because I don‚Äôt.  I support a well regulated capitalist economy under social democracy. But I just want to know the truth.",

It's funny to see a gen z judge millennials, you guys learned from them, it's kinda like the young sibling talking about the older one. Except the younger one doesn't learn from the older one's mistakes. Gen Zs are extremely pampered and u worry, they are progressive af which isn't a bad thing, if anyone knows about gen Zs it's the millennials. Based on all these school shootings, gen Zs are all talk and no sound reason, often too emotional. Most likely cause they're still young, especially with the younger gen Zs..\n\nOnly time will tell, but as an older gen Z myself I can most certainly see the potential, but it's mainly hype as of right now. They're getting the platform to soon, btw I'm not hating on gen Zs I'm just a bit older. I can remember 9/11, and within that time frame there's a huge change in society, how people think and how technology changed...",

Before all of that we were playing internet games, how many of these young kids are playing internet games now?\n\n\nThey have social media accounts and the latest phones way before at certain ages where they shouldn't.

The problem is that it depends on what sources you look at because they ALL give different years for the generations. So some will say you are a millennial and some say you are of Gen Z. It's hard because Gen Z is so young that exports are debating on what years to start and end the generation.",

The age of each generation is 18 years and then a new generation starts. Do you know why? Legal consent to sex. The generation that is breeding must be 18 or older by law in order to consent to sex. The average age of a new generation being created after the previous become adults is around 5 years (23 years old).\nMillennials gave birth to generation Z around the years of 2000-2008. Which would line up with the proper age of over 18 and younger than 25.\nGeneration Z will create the next generation starting in 2018 at the earliest since they themselves have become 18 by then. The majority of millennials would have given birth by this point (peak female reproductive age below 30). The last of millennials to give birth before 30 years old were born in 1998, and become 30 by 2028.\nI just felt like typing all of this word salad for no reason.",

The oldest Gen Z is 23 right now, which mean only 5 years of Gen Z are adults who have experienced life in the fullest. Even at that, only a sliver of life has been experienced. Including children to speak for the generation, how they think and behave is wrong because they are still developing critical thinking skills and growing mentally and physically. You would need every gen Z to pass age 23-26 and average their overall contribution to actually make a good conclusion on who or what they are as a whole.",

A generation can't be solidified based on actively changing variables, thus you ask people who are for the most part set in stone about their way of life (adults). While it is valuable to gather information about how kids behave, they do not represent the final product of the generation because they are constantly changing every aspect of their life until they enter adulthood and even until their mid twenties. Asking young kids questions they don't know how to answer realistically completely defeats the purpose when they don't have a grasp on the real world. That's not an insult it's just a part of growing up. The face of the generation is the workforce currently, 18+ they are making real world impacts and they are how people perceive the generation as a whole because it's well understood that kids develope for a long time before they can offer wisdom and confidence in themselves and their peers. These kids will get asked questions and for input when they reach the stage of their lives with they impact the world, which they don't do as mere children alone. Nobody is limiting their opinion or voice, but we will take it with a grain of salt because kids flip flop on topics all the time, and we need concrete answers when they are more mature. I am Gen Z in my twenties, I actively impact what others perceive of Gen Z because I am in the workforce with 3-4 other generations, THAT is what I am implying. Nobody will take you as you are as a kid because you change every year as you grow, but you remain relatively the same as an adult.",

Studies have shown we tend to have a more conservative view, which the previous few generations haven't. With a new outlook through that we might make changes for the better. Not all of us have mental disorders or act fully stupid. Like someone mentioned before me, the internet just allows you to see us do more stupid stuff because we can post it wherever. Also I've seen studies and even had a psychology teacher explain that older generations use their phones more in a day. Also people born in the 50's had extra carbon in their DNA from all the nuclear bomb tests at the time, so there were problems with them mentally. Doesn't mean they're a terrible generation though. My argument seems more biased as someone born in generation z but I truly believe we aren't going to be much worse if at all  worse than previous generations.",

It's a well known phenomenon that older generations are generally of the opinion that the younger generations are useless, lazy, spoiled, etc. \n\nI think it's rather insensitive to blame Gen Z for our mental disorders. Blaming someone for their bad mental health is a lovely way to send them into a downward spiral of self destruction, and generally a shit idea. While obviously I don't want my generation to have these issues, we do, but calling us \"the regression of the species\" (nice college graduate lingo btw) is helping? how???\n\nThis is especially ridiculous to me considering that this bad mental health is heavily influenced, in my experience, by the stress of inadequate education, which doesn't prepare us for the real world, and contributes to stress, and the events happening currently- the insane political division and general chaos in our halls of government, the ongoing occurrence of terror attacks and school shootings, the opioid crisis, etc. etc.",

Obviously.\n\nBut the general generation will be in their 20s, which can easily be grouped together with some young 30 yr olds and older teens. Kind of like millennials a few years ago. Now all the teens are gen Z and those in their mid 30s are millenials.",

Seth, the guy who replied to you made a pretty good point about Gen X because my dad actually came from Gen X. \n\nI feel like Gen X parents really sowed the ideas of being a hard worker into most Gen Z kids and we tend to pick up on a lot of our Gen X parent's work ethics, but this is of course from a more conservative side of a Gen Z childhood. I've noticed that the more liberal/democratic Gen Z kids bring up some pretty sharp ideas to our current social climate, they are a lot more vocal, and they provide better perspective than most Millennials (but this could just be bias since im Gen Z myself lol.) This obviously reflects from the problems that the more democratic Gen X parents faced back in their youth. \n\nEither way, we all as a collective have a very rebellious nature and I feel like this stems from our parents as well. A lot of us want change so that it can tailor to the individual instead of the masses. Talking to most democratic/liberal people in my generation has always met a good middle ground and we both gained good insight and perspective from each other. The ability to relate to one another on even the most superficial thing is one of the most beautiful experiences that our Generation has and I feel like we are definitely going to solve a lot of problems as more of us start rolling into adulthood.",

It makes me sad that people label a whole generation (MY generation) in such a way when there are so many amazing, wonderful human beings within it that just want to change the world for the better - for everyone. I believe that the reason you (and others) may see Gen Z kids as disrespectful is because we see past the bullshit and the lies within society and we refuse to bow down and accept that this is all the world can ever be. We don't respect people who don't earn it, it's simple. I am so so sorry that you've had bad experiences with my generation in the past, but I can assure you that we will not let  the world down because we've grown up seeing evil and suffering everywhere and all we want to do is change it. We don't let this evil and suffering turn us bitter and brittle, we use it to see the beauty and kindness in the world as it is, and how it could be in the future if we keep fighting. Damn I am proud to be part of Generation Z.",

This is the difference between intelligence and wisdom, foresight is not usually something that younger people have much of. It's also important to look to the previous generation's mistakes and how that has lead to where we are today (baby boomers were given everything and are not the most entitled generation alive. Gen X was the divorce or latch-key (basically raised themselves while their parents worked/dated) generation. They were the original free-range kids. Millennials were raised in an era of \"you can be anything!\" We know now that was bad information. Gen Z is leaning back to something more akin to the Greatest Generation, that you can't have it all, but you can have it good. \n\nHaving a long view of what has worked for other generations through lots and lots of experience will add a depth of wisdom to the younger generations. It is impossible to learn these experiences through educational channels alone. You have to live through it to know it. Let's work together to shape the world for your children to be a place where we live in harmony with our environment and with each other. Let's learn from the mistakes of the recent past by learning from those who were there.",

I also think with the advent of technology human work is becoming fabricated for the sake of the economy. Since the transition to the service industry, it seems technology is allowing us to pursue more intellectual work which naturally lends itself towards the hobby territory.

We are constantly at pressure of being like somebody, following an ideal or creating something great. We just cant be satisfied with what we are and what we have produced through our work. \nI must say, that generation z is the one whose work is most highly viewed through fixed parameters of judgement. We just cant enjoy our work without caring about about how the authority will percieve it. Sure, we are encouraged to be entrepreneurial/creative, but we know that deep down, this encouragement is linked to economic or societal gains, thus eliminating the possibility of pure contentment due to the work we do. \nThis comment might seem like it wants to push forward a socialist agenda. And that is true. A society without a capitalist heirarchy is something we need, and we need it desperately.\nEven though it might logically seem like socialism doesn't work, but u can't deny that their is very little fulfillment in doing things just to satisfy some parameters on which u r being judged.\nThis is not simply because we dont like being judged. This is because we as human beings are biologically wired to overreach, to experience novelty, to be free  of authoritarian judgement.",

We come after the most economically and socially left wing generation in American history so it only makes sense that the following generation would show a certain level of backlash against that.

More to the point, it sounds like just another way for the corporations to squeeze every moment of labor out of you they can without compensating you for it properly. Blend? It will blend like oil and water, and the work part will always rise to the top. Yoou can't do work and not work at the same time. Studies have shown that multi-tasking is BS, people can not do it, All they can do is move from one task to another, and they lose focus every time they do it. And they do not get better at it over time. In fact, they get worse.",

People will become less hostile towards zero hours contracts and skills/labour will be pooled into a more fluid marketplace rather than individual companies. In other words, work will be based less on long term employment contracts and more on freelance or agency hiring.",

It's a selfish generation which was created by a previous selfish generation it's like selfishness on steroids now - not going to be pretty.  It all started because of 1930's depression- growing up with nothing parents wanted to give their kids everything they never had- a few generations of that and you repeat the economic cycle of depression.  Don't see how they will fair well in an economic collapse bigger and longer then 1930's was",
