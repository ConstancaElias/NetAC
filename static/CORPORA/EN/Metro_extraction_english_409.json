        "postText": "Jean-Claude Juncker has hit out at the \u2018bulls**t\u2019 sold to the public by the British press during the referendum campaign.', 'The outgoing European Commission (EC) President slammed Boris Johnson for \u2018lying\u2019, and said he was so convinced Britain would vote Leave, he had even made a bet on it.', 'Speaking at a think tank event in Brussels this evening, Mr Juncker \u2013 who is set to be replaced by Ursula von der Leyen next Friday \u2013 also claimed it was a \u2018major error\u2019 to accept David Cameron\u2019s request not to speak out over Brexit.', 'He explained: \u2018David Cameron asked me not to intervene in the referendum campaign because he said the European Commission is even less popular on the islands than on the continent.', '\u2018That was a major mistake, a major error. I should have intervened, because nobody was denying, contesting the lies Boris Johnson and others were spreading around.\u2019', 'Slating the two British Prime Ministers and the media, Mr Juncker said the papers had spouted \u2018nonsense\u2019 and \u2018bulls**t\u2019 \u2018day after day\u2019 for 46 years.', 'He said the press had portrayed Britain as \u2018not really in Europe\u2026 [only being there] for economic and internal market reasons\u2019.', 'It is not the first time Mr Juncker has hit out at Brexit and key backers of the Leave campaign.', 'Earlier this week he labelled Brexit a \u2018waste of time and energy\u2019.', 'Singling out Mr Johnson for criticism tonight, he continued: \u2018They were saying things, some of them \u2013 lying. Telling the people things which have nothing to do with our day by day reality.\u2019', 'As a result, he said the outcome of the referendum was unsurprising, declaring himself \u2018always convinced\u2019 the referendum would be a \u2018negative\u2019 one.', 'He said he had bet a British commissioner that Leave would win, suggesting he would give him a euro if he was wrong, and that he be given a pound if he was right.', '\u2018I have the pound in my pocket\u2019, he said.', 'Defending the EC when asked what mistakes they had made under his leadership, he said the commission was not responsible for the result of the referendum and that it had not been part of the debate.",

As far as I'm aware investment in Europe, US and everywhere else hasn't plummeted like in the UK And the same goes for jobs since the worldwide phenomena you might be referring to is for car manufacturing which doesn't employ a huge amount of British workers and tends to have more part time and <b> zero </b>hours workers than most other sectorsBut I say this as an actuary (someone who specialises in the risks surrounding current and future economy and cash flows)....
