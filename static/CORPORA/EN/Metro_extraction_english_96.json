        "postText": "A blogger who\u2019s been accused of blackfishing and sent death threats as a result says she has no plans to stop tanning.', 'If you\u2019ve been on the internet recently, you\u2019ll have spotted chat about blackfishing.', 'Blackfishing refers to the act of manipulating one\u2019s appearance to look like a different race.', 'This is a form of cultural appropriation. A blackfisher takes on traits that black women face prejudice for \u2013 bigger lips, darker skin, curly hair, curves \u2013 and is celebrated as a result. They\u2019ll often be influencers or Instagrammers, receiving financial gain and hundreds of likes because they have attributes that are deemed attractive, but, the argument of accusers goes, are \u2018safe\u2019 because they\u2019re not actually black.', 'Blackfishing is an ignorance of the cultural implications of what a blackfisher thinks are style choices. It\u2019s an ignorance of the privilege one has to be able to look black without the social implications of being a black woman.', 'Some of the women who have been accused of blackfishing include blogger Emma Hallberg, who denied doing anything to darken her skin, Mika Harris, and Aga Brzostowska, who said she\u2019s \u2018not trying to look black\u2019.', 'Henriette Otervik, also known as @henote, is a 24-year-old Norwegian blogger and influencer whose photos have been flooded with comments accusing her of blackfishing.', 'She\u2019d spotted questions about her race in the past, but says that there was a sudden bump in comments talking about her race when she debuted braids.', '\u2018When I did my braids it took off,\u2019 Henriette tells Metro.co.uk.', 'Henriette denies deceiving her followers or trying to look black. She doesn\u2019t see an issue with wearing her hair in braids, and claims that her skin is naturally dark \u2013 when asked if she used self tan, Henriette responded: \u2018No. I like the tan I get from the sun best\u2019 \u2013 despite previously posting that her tan was the result of an hour at a salon.', '\u2018It was never my intention to pretend to be another race,\u2019 Henriette tells us over email. \u2018Personally, I think the braids looks amazing and that is the reason I got them.', '\u2018I\u2019m not trying to be another race. I just took some braids because I have always wanted them.', '\u2018I think it is cool and I like to stand out. I did my braids in an afrosalon and all of the people who worked there said it was so nice on me and no one of them got offended.', '\u2018Before I styled my hair this way, I told my followers that I wanted to get African braids. I got a lot of feedback and about 95% of them where positive and the rest of them called me racist and that I should not do it.\u2019', 'After posting photos of her braids, Henriette says she received cruel comments and death threats. We looked at the comments on her Instagram photos and can\u2019t see any death threats, but there are dedicated blackfishing Instagram accounts commenting on her posts and requests for her to stop trying to be or appear black\u2019.', '\u2018Just because of my braids I have received comments like \u201cslut\u201d, \u201choe\u201d, and \u201ctrash\u201d,\u2019 says Henriette. \u2018Some people have even sent me death threats.', '\u2018I find it funny that people think it is okay to bully you, just because you are doing something they do not like.', '\u2018I guess it is easier to spread hateful comments on the internet since you do not have to face the person. I find it very alarming that people are daily spreading hate across the internet. It is not okay, and it can hurt more than it seems.\u2019', 'Henriette isn\u2019t a fan of the current conversation around cultural appropriation and blackfishing, commenting that there shouldn\u2019t be \u2018lines between races\u2019.', 'She tells us: \u2018We used a long time fighting for the same rights, so why should we go back in time and say that only white people can have straight hair and only black people can have braids?', '\u2018My opinion is that we are all the same and I think that none of the races can claim a thing to be \u201ctheirs\u201d and tell [people] that only they can wear it.', '\u2018If we take my country as an example; On our constitution day many people wear bunad, which is Norwegian national clothing.', '\u2018People from other countries, who have other nationalities also use them and I don\u2019t get offended by that, I love it!', '\u2018We are all the same, we are human!\u2019', 'It\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that Norwegian people were persecuted for wearing bunad, or that Norwegians in general face prejudice because of their cultural clothing. On days such as the consitution day, bunad is worn to celebrate and honour Norway.', 'Braids arguably have a different meaning.', 'Braids have been used by black women for centuries, and represent more than just a hairstyle. Hair was used to represent the tribe a woman belonged to. When women were captured and forced into slavery, their braids were often shaved off in an attempt to strip away the women\u2019s identity.', 'Braids have been used as an act of resistance. During slavery women would use their braids as a secret messaging system to communicate maps and ways to freedom to others in slavery.', 'That\u2019s just a small part of the cultural meaning of braids that\u2019s ignored when white women wear the hairstyle to look cute.', 'Then there\u2019s the privilege of how a white woman with braids is treated versus a black woman.', 'Black women are discouraged from wearing their hair natural and free, from restrictive beauty standards and ideas of what \u2018good\u2019 hair looks like \u2013 smooth, blow-dried waves \u2013 to company dress codes. Braids are an answer to those restrictions; a way to protect the hair and keep it manageable.', 'But even when braids are meant to be a \u2018safe\u2019 hairstyle, women still face alleged prejudice for having them.', 'Earlier this year an 11-year-old girl was told her braided hairstyle violated her school\u2019s dress code. Last year a Banana Republic employee was told her braids were too \u2018urban\u2019 and \u2018unkempt\u2019 for the brand\u2019s image.', 'It may be true that Henriette has to face negative comments for her hairstyle, but she doesn\u2019t have to overcome the daily hurdles created by racism.', 'In the past month she\u2019s posted three photos sponsored by watch brand Daniel Wellington. Clearly her braids and dark skin aren\u2019t hindering her ability to work and represent a brand.', 'Regardless, Henriette has no plans to change up her hair or skin, despite the criticism.', '\u2018I do not feel that I tan too much, even though some people say I do,\u2019 the influencer tells us. \u2018I tan easily, and I am lucky to have the opportunity to travel as much as I do.', '\u2018I cannot sit inside my hotel room all day while I am on vacation just because some people thinks I am too tan.', '\u2018No, I\u2019m not [changing how I look]. People will always tell you what to do, and what not to do.', '\u2018I never listen, because all that matters is to be kind and that\u2019s something people never can take away from you.\u2019",
