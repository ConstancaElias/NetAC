        "postText": "'Jo Swinson has been attacked online after she accused TV broadcasters of sexist behaviour after ITV excluded her for the upcoming election debate. The Liberal Democrats have lodged a formal complaint with ITV, claiming there was no reasonable justification for staging a debate involving only Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn.Speaking on Sky News, the Liberal Democrat leader said the action was clearly\u201c sexist\u201d since she was a woman.', ' The debate, scheduled for 19 November, will make television history as the first head - to - head debate between the leaders of the two main parties.', 'ITV\u2019 s news presenter Julie Etchingham will be in charge of quizzing the leaders.', ' Ms Swinson told Sophy Ridge: I am a candidate to be a Prime Minister in this election, and frankly when you look at how Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are carrying on, I think I could do a better job than either of them.', 'It is ridiculous that on the biggest debate facing our country, you have one side of that debate completely unrepresented.', 'Ridge responded that the Liberal Democrats only had 20 seats - compared to the 542 MPs between Labour and the Conservatives.', 'Ms Swinson pointed to the three - way debates in the 2010 campaign, claiming that the Liberal Democrats are closer to the main parties now than they were then.', 'Suggesting that sexism was behind the move, the Liberal Democrat leader said: 'In that election we had Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg - spot the difference.', 'Frankly, you 've got a suggestion from a broadcaster that it will be two chaps chatting about how they are going to leave the European Union, leaving out the voice for millions of Remainers who want to stop Brexit and stay in the EU.' , 'And, yeah, I happen to be a woman, well isn't that interesting because when it was Nick Clegg there was no problem with him being in the debates.', 'Either it 's sexist, or they're scared, or maybe it 's a bit of both.', 'However, online viewers were unimpressed with her remarks, with many commenting that the excuse was painful to watch.', 'One commented: It's because she's irrelevant, despite her delusions of grandeur.', 'Several pointed out that if the reason was sexism then Nicola Sturgeon had a better claim of a debate place since the SNP outnumbered Liberal Democrats in Westminster.', 'Another tweeted: It's not sexism, it's a debate between the two people who can conceivably be PM.', 'Chuka Umunna had earlier tweeted an attack on the TV broadcasters.', 'The senior Liberal Democrat MP said: Excluding women from the #GE2019 leaders' debates is sexist, undemocratic and wrong.', 'These two blokes don 't speak for Britain, we are not a 2 party country and the millions of people who want to #stopbrexit won't have a voice.'",
