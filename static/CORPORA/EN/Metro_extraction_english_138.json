        "postText": "Thousands of people are campaigning to shut down a \u2018sick and disgusting\u2019 website that trolled an ill baby with racist abuse.', 'Thomas Greenwood and his partner Ashton Daley were \u2018devastated\u2019 to discover their two-year-old son Albie had been mocked on a vile racist forum.', 'He was born with bowels outside of his body and underwent lifesaving surgery in December 2017.', 'Last week the couple discovered that his name and pictures are being made fun of on white supremacist website \u2018Chimpmania\u2019.', 'The website takes articles about people of colour and twists them into stories littered with racial slurs.', 'Albie\u2019s dad Thomas, 27, told Metro.co.uk: \u2018We were only made aware of it a few days ago, it looks like it\u2019s been online since Albie was born.', '\u2018It\u2019s horrifying. I\u2019m quite easy going as a person and I let a lot of stuff go, but the fact they have brought a little boy into it is absolutely disgusting. I\u2019m so shocked to see racism of that extent.', '\u2018We are a normal, hardworking family and we do what we need to do to get by.', '\u2018We will not let them get away with this. We are not the only people they are targeting.\u2019', 'Albie\u2019s parents, from Huddersfield, have started a petition for the website to be taken down.', 'The petition, started by Albie\u2019s mum Ashton, states: \u2018The comments and hatred towards us was outrageous and I hope that we can put an end to this terrible malicious site before more families and people are hurt.', '\u2018Let\u2019s not let our children grow up to see this despicable and evil side of the world. It\u2019s not right and it\u2019s not fair.\u2019', 'The petition has been signed by over 4,000 people already in less than a week.', 'However Albie\u2019s parents, who have another son Jacob, aren\u2019t the first victims who have campaigned against the vile website.', 'The website appears to have been running for 10 years, with numerous petitions calling for it to be removed proving unsuccessful.', 'The identity of website host \u2013 a service that allows anyone to create a website \u2013 is protected by cyber security service Cloudfare, who say they have no power to remove the vile site.', 'Thomas said: \u2018Police can\u2019t do anything because it\u2019s an American website. I have emailed [Cloudfare] and we started a petition.', '\u2018Other than that I don\u2019t know where to go. It seems pointless trying to contact them directly. I don\u2019t know how the hell they are getting away with this.\u2019', 'A spokesperson from Cloudfare said they have passed the complaint along to the website host.', 'Although they can\u2019t reveal who the host is \u2013 they have offered to put the family in touch with them privately.', 'The spokesperson said: \u2018Cloudflare does not host the content in question and therefore cannot take it down. Cloudflare acts as a pass-through service, sitting between a website host and an end-user to ensure that Internet properties are safe from cyberattack and that the end-user has access to a fast Internet.', '\u2018That said, we\u2019ve passed the complaint along and would be happy to connect the family with the host in order to directly address the content.\u2019",

However supremacist websites are ethically and morally questionable, but not illegal in the US... yet.  The family in question just needs to find the right Democrat politician's ear to whisper in who can put political pressure on the relevant law authorities to apply the pressure on Cloudflare to throttle the site's network traffic flow.Better still, pay hackers to dump a load of child porn on that website under the accounts of the worst racists then rat them out to the cops and the <b> racist </b>website'll dissapear, along with the racists.",
