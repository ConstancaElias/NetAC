        "postText": "Schools and workplaces must have rules and it is reasonable they extend to how we present ourselves, but hair policies that fail to take into consideration curly afro hair are racist.', 'Policies that require black people to alter their hair in an attempt to mimic straight, European, white hair standards are literally tools of white supremacy.', 'These rules tell black people whiteness is the default and failure to conform will result in the loss of employment or, in the case of five year old Josiah Sharpe, the loss of education.', 'Josiah\u2019s mother, Danica Sharpe, started a petition after her son was excluded from Summerhill Primary Academy in Birmingham for not adhering to their hair policies.', 'The school claims students\u2019 \u2018hairstyles must not detract from learning\u2019. Josiah has been excluded from school until his hair grows back from the style his mother chose to help hide his traction alopecia. Sharpe hopes her petition will bring about policy change as well as national \u2018guidelines to prevent this damaging more children like Josiah.\u2019', 'This is not an isolated incident.', 'I cried watching the viral video of black high school wrestler Andrew Johnson having his hair hacked away.', 'I do not use the words like \u2018white supremacist violence\u2019 as hyperbole.', 'Johnson was taking part in an important competition when the referee presiding over the match told Johnson that his locs weren\u2019t in line with regulation. Maloney gave the teenager an ultimatum: to cut his hair or forfeit the match.', 'The 16 year old, committed to his team and their success, sobbed as his hair was cut right there in front of an auditorium full of people more concerned with winning the match than the wellbeing of this child. And make no mistake: Andrew Johnson is a child and what those adults allowed to be done to him was a blatant act of white supremacy.', 'In 2017 Chikayzea Flanders was excluded from Fulham Boys\u2019 School in London for refusing to cut his locs despite being a Rastafarian. When asked if the school\u2019s hair policies pointed to discrimination, headteacher Alun Ebenezer claimed, \u2018At the moment we are treating this as a social issue. I have seen no tenets that you have to have dreadlocks\u2019.', 'Ebenezer makes it known that because he does not believe Rastafari and locs are synonymous they are up for negotiation.', 'Chikayzea moved school while his mother, Tuesday Flanders, took Fulham Boys\u2019 School to court. In September 2018 the school and the family reached an agreement allowing the child to return to school if he tied his locs back and off his collar.', 'When questioned again, Mr Ebenezer said, \u2018Our uniform policy means you don\u2019t know whose parents earn millions of pounds and who comes from an area with real social deprivation. It shows that only character matters and raises aspiration.\u2019 Ebenezer\u2019s first problem is that he insinuates a link between social deprivation and poverty with having locs. His second problem is these hair policies actually do not show that \u2018only character matters.\u2019', 'I do not use the words like \u2018white supremacist violence\u2019 as hyperbole. I use them purposefully to dislodge the myths and fantasies that white supremacy and racism exist only in the far away Ku Klux Klan, or Tommy Robinson.', 'If these hair policies could in any way be fairly applied across races where are the stories of white schoolgirls missing out on their education\u2013 like Zulaikha Patel who was told to cut her afro or face expulsion?', 'Where are the stories of white women told they\u2019d miss out on employment opportunities because of their hair, like Simone Powderly? The reports of women dismissed from the Navy for refusing to cut their locs like Jessica Sims? Or the women allegedly fired because she \u2018intimidates\u2019 her colleagues with her hair and clothing, like Melphine Evans?', 'The rigorous implementation of draconian hair policies disproportionately disenfranchises black and brown children and working adults \u2013 Danica Sharpe has the right idea in campaigning for nationwide guidelines to stop school and workplace hair policies targeting these minorities.', 'These guidelines, supported by the full weight of the government, would equip those responsible for creating said policies with a basic understanding of black hair.', 'I wholeheartedly agree hair policies in schools and some work places are positive and do not believe that those involved in creating controversial ones were intentionally racist. Yet only a little more effort is needed to consider what neat hairstyles can be feasibly attained by black hair \u2013 and no more effort than was required for coming up with the hair policies in the first place.', 'Whether the intention or not, policies that fail to consider black people \u2013 and as a result exclude them from participating in education or employment \u2013 are racist.', 'Until racial and cultural differences are taken into account these hair policies remain white supremacist tools of oppression.",

After all, other children don't wear it? If you had straight hair and you were forced to have a tight perm to look a certain way as a dress code at school somewhere, just because everyone else has that type of hair naturally - is that equality? Equality is treating everyone the same not forcing everyone to look the same.",

For instance examples given of young boy with alopecia whose mother chose a specific style to help disguise it, or young girl in South Africa who is told to chemically straighten her natural hair. This debate is not simply about rebelling conformity but standad's being set that deny someone's natural identity.Their education and <b> mental </b>wellbeing is being sacrificed for the need to control and dictate what is right. Universal dress codes should not completely eradicate a person's culture or being.The rules should accommodate people i.e hair could be kept tidy out of the face. Long  hair tied up etc.But if there ever was a modern day Samson the school would effectively play the role of Delilah.I believe in looking at people as a whole not through a tiny perspective as one way is right, it can help the wellbeing of all.But as<b>  black</b> people are affected in numbers by these standards their wellbeing has never been included in dictating the standards.The dress code then becomes a tool to exclude this social group.",
