In the UK you can be visited by the Police for 'hate speech' which is just defined as anything said that causes hurt - without any evidence. On the other hand if you get burgled there's little chance the police will visit. So basis of proof is a thing of the past with our current justice system applicable to UK but guessing France is similar now.",

The President's personal life may be the source of great ridicule amongst the Brits, especially those unable to string together a cogent point, but I can assure you, amongst the French electorate, it doesn't matter a jot. They are the only ones that matter. Now, back to the suggested legislation.........",

A 29 - year - old French man went on trial on Tuesday in a Paris suburb accused of sexually abusing 11 - year - old girl in a case that has rekindled debate about France\u2019 s age of consent. France does not have a legal age under which a minor cannot agree to a sexual relationship\u2013 although the country\u2019 s top court has ruled that children aged five and under cannot consent.Lawyers for the suspect argued that the girl was consenting and aware of what she was doing, while lawyers for the girl have said she was simply too young and confused to resist. In a decision that shocked many, the prosecutor\u2019 s office in the town of Pontoise decided to put the man on trial not for rape but on charges of sexual abuse of a minor under 15. Defence lawyers say the man and the girl had met in a park and the girl had voluntarily followed him to an apartment and consented to intercourse.They have also said their client, then 28, thought she was at least 16. Wednesday February 14 th 2018. Would you say their legislation for this sort of crime should be a greater priority.",

The problem is she had a huge problem in deciding whether to publish the video because every single man who abused her, followed her, demanded she give them <b> sex </b>..... was a muslim. And that was despite the fact the vast majority of the men she walked by were not muslims. So she decided to put the video up anyway and then she was accused of being a hater by fellow feminists for simply showing the truth of who really was abusing women.
