I ripped  his teacher a new asshole and should have had them fired.... IMAGINE IF IT WERE 4 BOYS AND A GIRL?  the boy would have gone to a  detention center.  I fucking hate feminism..... I handed in my feminism card that day... I now have a grandson... I will fight against feminsm till the day I die... it is worse than cancer!!!!!!!!!",

I was ordered to pay child support,  which is fine, but the part I don't think is fine is I was 18, didn't have insurance at the time. She didn't have insurance either.  The judge ordered me to pay the hospital bill.  Not we split it, but I had to pay the entire bill. My son is 19 now. I calculated what it all cost. $118,000. \n\nKids are expensive.  Just graduated high school,  and basically got a bill for 120,000 dollars and 18 years to pay it. \n\nIt was really tough at times, there were many times I thought to myself,  I could raise my son myself,  and would cost me the same. I felt like I was paying for everything and she didn't have to financially support him at all. \n\nBut I love my son, and I didn't mind paying to make sure he had everything he needed.

If we want to fix the problems we face we need to start by looking at our legal system and its structure within its historical context and secondly realize the ways in which society has changed and thirdly determine whether or not those systems are adequate to the new social reality or if they need to be changed. Alimony is a perfect example. Alimony made sense 50 years ago when women primarily kept the home. The work was divided and hence the income despite being solely or primarily earned by the man should be divided as well. The social fabric has changed though and women have careers now and men share the duties at home. Before women had no sufficient work experience or income that they could rely on but now they do.  Alimony was a proper solution to past problems but now is inadequate to current social realities. This is an area among many others that needs to be updated to deal with that new reality.",

The day before my birthday my mom took me and my sister to the guy who she was cheating with, which I can assume as a bonus intentional kick to my dads nuts. I only learned all this recently. The fine details. She took me from my dad in March 2009 and I moved back to my dads in June 2013 because she was boozin again and I've been here since. Now she's boozin again and I wouldn't be surprised if she was dead because I haven't heard from her in a while. Like a month ago she was blackout drunk and had the nerve to ask me if I wanted to come see her. She's been drunk since March this year and it's September now. She's a garbage human who just wants booze and dick even if it kills her. Which it might have",

            "commentText": "Its ironic how modern feminists, progressives, and liberals are some of the most hypocritical, sexist, authoritarian, and <b> racist </b>people you will ever find in the US and the west in general for that matter. These people are literally creating social hierarchies based on<b>  gender</b><b> , rac</b>e, and social orientation. They are so extreme in their ideologies that they view anyone who doesnt agree with anything they say, no matter how stupid or irrational, alt right and nazis. They still claim theyre oppressed in a society that caters to their every fucking whim. And whats most annoying about these people is they claim to be the moral authority on every issue while constantly infringing on the rights of other individuals to further their own goals. These people want to be the creators and leaders of a \"new world\" without having any personal accountability whatsoever and acting like children who cant solve their own problems. Theyre a joke and the fact we take them seriously is a sin unto itself.",

We are vulnerable. The current view of feminism is false. \nMen and women need to respect each other, their strength and vulnerabilities. What is missing in the law is that men are vulnerable too. Women need to look after gentlemen and give them the honor they deserve or there will be none left. It is the later that needs addressing",

Either the man or<b>  woman</b> works so the other doesnt have to so they dont go to college or work at all. and 5, 10, 20 years down the road the couple splits up.\n  Well now that person who has little to no work experience and is 30 plus year<b> s ol</b>d gets tossed to the curb. Since they thought they were in a relationship that would last forever and are now pretty much fucked because they are in a point in time in life were its much harder to get into the workforce. In that situation i think the person should be compensated.\n  But then there is the situation where lets say a girl cheats on her husband and leaves him and he gets completely fucked over financially. He d<b> id nothi</b>ng wrong but be a loving husband to a whore. There are so many different situations when it comes to divorce and since most judges are bias you cant do it by case by case situation. \n  And that is why God created the prenup!",

The man kindly declines a few times because he isn't attracted to her. But one weekend, he is sitting around the house after a rough week and decides to get drunk. The<b>  woman</b> pushes to come over again and he finally says okay. She claimed to be on birth control prior to all of this and they hav<b> e se</b>x. Guy wakes up the next day, doesn't even remember majority of the night or how it went down. Literally like 3 days later, the girl gets a<b> ll cra</b>zy and says she feels pregnant and that she has been trying for five years with her ex to get pregnant. Then the guy says \"you were on birth control right?\"... she says \"No I wasn't.\" and the guy is like, wait a minute.. she lied. The man tells her this whole night was a big mistake. A couple weeks later, she says she is pregnant and then immediately starts talking about finances. She also asks him if they were going to get together and if not she was going to take him to court. He blocks her because she is acting <b> all cr</b>azy and he doesn't believe her, because she is claiming she is knocked up a week before her period. A year later, the man gets a letter requesting a DNA test. In the hearing, this lady tells them she quit her job a few days before the hearing (to try to get more money off the man) and they passively call her out on it........ I know a guy who dealt with this. We all do silly things sometimes, but does one drunken night with a baby trap artist have to cost this man his livelihood? First off she lied about being on birth control. She obviously wanted to try to trap this man and was obviously trying to fish as much as she could off of him. I feel that is a little unfair. It's not fair for the child either and I agree the kid should be taken care of. But I think there needs to be a better system for that. Because anyone who has seen this first hand could tell you the mother and father are NOT on even ground. 80 percent of that support does not go into the child. There just needs to be a better system. Maybe a card that the child has that the income goes into. That BOTH parents pay into. Where everything that is taken out is monitored and only to be used to support that child. This would be beneficial in many ways. Women would also be more inclined to not want to attempt to trap a man when that money isn't filling their pockets.",

Why are men who are deadbeats in the same category as responsible fathers treated like shit and taken to the cleaners? I do not agree with the child support laws at all. Men loose there jobs and go to jail for back owed support because they are laid off... licenses have been taken because of late payments... its 100% BS and is not realistic. The amount of money these men pay leaves them living in studio apartments struggling when it's not necessary. A <b> woman </b>can make double what a man makes, have three car loans while living in excess and STILL cry poverty! It's easy for a man to say it's fair when he has never experienced this. It's not all peace love and chicken Greases my man.",

Rape is terrible and a lot of women really don't get justice they deserve however getting framed for rape when you havent done anything is nearly as bad.  All these false assault claims and calling men  pure evil for even just looking at a girl and the hate speeches coming from feminists lately is really a lot like crying wolf.

            "commentText": "Wow, some interesting comments on this thread. Makes me glad I'm already married to a decent guy. Anyway, I actually agree with a lot of what these two said. But, I do think a lot of people are not understanding what is going on with feminism right now. So, for a long time, physical strength was what was needed to survive and men held most of the power because of that. Women gave birth and did the home stuff, and men went out and killed things and did all the 'man stuff'. Then we evolved and physical strength became less and less important to surviving and being successful, and yet we had evolved into these roles for thousands and thousands of years. Now, we live in societies where it's not physical strength, but ideas, etc that is valued and the balance of power started to shift. The problem is that when pendulums swing from one side, they don't just settle in the middle. The momentum swings it almost back as far to the other side before it loses its momentum and goes back to the center. What we are seeing right now is that the pendulum has swung too far one way and people are reacting. But, that was always what was going to happen. Knowing that will help us minimize the damage before things settle in the middle, which will be a slow process over time.",

On the surface its fucking obvious that this was something that feminists accomplished for the sake of equality right?\n\n\nWell... if you dig up even a little bit you start to notice <b> weird </b>things. In most places in the world women were actually voting against their own right to vote more than men.(This is not an opinion we have literal records of this.)\nWell is there a reason for that? oh Its because at the time women assumed that obtaining the right to vote would make them equal to men which meant they would have to share in the responsibilities of men and they were not interested in fun stuff like being drafted. So feminism fought so that men and women would obtain this equality despite most women not being interested?\nNo they basically fought for women to get the right to vote without any of the responsibilities associated with it. So literally the most notable thing feminists have ever done was to actively fight against equality based on the belief that women weren't as capable as men.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong I'm not saying that we should include women in the draft...but if you believe in equality and that women are exactly as capable as men in every way possible...You shouldn't have a problem with women being drafted. But obviously theres also the problem that a lot of the responsibilities feminists were refusing had<b>  nothing</b> to do with the physical differences between men and women so can't be excused as easily.",

We need to let men do what they really do best and that is take care of us. Let them feel important and take what we have piled on our plates and share with men. Men are built and designed to protect us. Not that women shouldn't take care of herself but that men need to be needed.

He adopts some women's views that just happen to align with his own which then he thinks gives him enough reason to call himself a feminist.  He's also doing a highly manipultive move  - convince someone that their attempt at protecting themselves is actually a regressive system designed by the opposing side ( in this case the <b> patriarchy)</b>, therefore devaluing and tainting the very thing that will help them. His support of that<b>  woman</b>'s tweet shows his true colours.\n\nAlso, there are many situations where it's difficult to say a clear, assertive 'no'. The fact that Taddeus doesn't acknowledge that shows how little he knows. If you are in a rotten system, like a university where the leadership has more interest in protecting itself than the welfare of it's students or staff, you will probably find it very difficult to report a lecturer who's put a hand inbetween your legs whilst suggesting that you should discuss your grades over dinner. Many people would freeze in that situation and would try to politely decline for fear of retribution from said creep. Some men really don't like the word 'no'. It hurts their ego and they can become vengeful because of that.\n\nTry saying a clear 'no' to a guy that is deliberately blocking the exit in front of you (as happened to one colleague in my work a while ago when she was in an almost empty building). In that situation, the main goal is to stop it from escalating. In that fearful scenario, you simply don't know if what you do or say is going to make things worse and make the guy really angry, but if you DON'T say 'no', or 'get out of my way dickhead',  you have guys like this idiot insinuating that women who don't or can't say 'no' are somehow weak or helpless, as of that's an awful thing. In that kind of situation, <b> a woma</b>n IS helpless - for one thing, men have a far greater upper body strength not to mention arm muscles.",

They had adopted two girls, which was more of surprise for him, seeing as he came home to them after a business trip, since he was a traveling VP aerospace engineer.  However, being who he is as a person, he accepted and treated them as his own daughters, but his wife brainwashed them and divorced him.  Essentially, they hate him now to the point where one of them called him up on his birthday a few years back just to tell him how much she hated him.  She isn't a child, but a <b> woman </b>three years younger than me, which would make 24 years<b>  old</b> at the time.  So, he has to deal with that shit.  I also have to accept that he is still paying a ridiculous alimony amount that will only stop if she remarries.  Oh, she has had a boyfriend for well over 6 years, but no marriage.  I have always been skeptical of men because my birth father turned out to be a pedo that got away with it due to lack of evidence and witness testimony. My last stepdad wasn't a bad dude, but he wasn't a good guy for my mom.  Especially, since he had one toxic son that caused issues and one of my sisters who is birthed by mom in a previous marriage became toxic herself would conspire together making it even more difficult for that marriage to work.  I didn't know cause I was out being a jock and a dork with my friends until after we pack up and left when I was 16 right after I got home from school.  I see both sides of the spectrum since my real father was a dead beat that got away with things because he was high ranking military and a very good manipulator, not to mention an intimidating 10-degre<b> e blac</b>k belt at 6'9\" almost 300 pounds of muscle in the past.  So, he tried to get out of alimony when my mom needed the support while we ran to California for her new job, but I also see t<b> he wom</b>an who turns a good guy into a monster to everyone she talks to that doesn't know the guy personally or is starts it while their young to really sink it in.  Heck, my sister, the one who became a toxic liar, is actually quite nice to everyone except our mom, whom she has turned into a monster to her husband and his family, to all of her friends, and even tries to manipulate our cousins into turning on her.  So, I have kind of witnessed a lot of the good, the bad, and the ugly, but after my moms marriage to my \"dad\" and my sister not being in the picture anymore, which is a sore spot for my mom, but nevertheless, it is has been a boring, productive, enjoyable, and loving experience.",

Ex sergeant major of the marine Corp, multiple vehicles, a boat, pays everything in cash. He bought her a Harley just because, so they could ride together. Within months my dad gave up and was diagnosed with cancer. He passed just 4 months later. They lived in luxury; and I slept in a tiny fishing trailer by the lake in the middle of winter. My mom blames me for all of my hardships, and I've worked very, very hard to try to keep my head afloat. Just watching it all unravel broke me. And I've tried so hard to get ahead in life, but it never happens. It haunts me, and it's like a <b> black </b>cloud follows me everywhere and will not let me get ahead. I'll never not feel my dad's broken heart.",

He bought the house she wanted, got the pet pig she wanted, bought the 12,000 dollar boob job she wanted, and THEN after all that and she started becoming more attractive and going to the gym, that's when she decided to divorce him.

I don't want to say it that way (with absolutes), because I'm sure there are some <b> crazy </b>situations people will bring up, but generally, no one should be obligated on take care of someone forever. Mostly if something untoward happened the person should be compensated for what they helped with and/or there should be legal action taken against the guilty party. I.e. abuse, fraud, etc.\nAnother thing to say, women used to get shafted too- but I think it has changed a lot and does still vary by state a lot. My mom - a navy vet- worked and helped to put her first husband (not my dad) through med school, and he promised to support her in school when he was finished. He tried to literally turn her into a trophy wife, manipulated to change her behavior and motivations, change her personality and all, and she ended up with a divorce she didn't really want (she tried to reconcile) and he left her with absolutely<b>  nothing</b>. She's a wonderful and strong person, but she ha<b> d nothin</b>g, not even the full education she was aiming for. At least she still had the military and got through it- but it would have been a raw deal for anyone regardless <b> of gend</b>er.",

I do actually know a <b> woman </b>who has been a housewife since 19 (now around 60yo) and wanted to divorce but she can't because she can't work (no education, never worked all her life bc she raised child after child). In that case I suppose I understand... But I still wonder if the husband should have to pay? But who else would pay? I guess it would have to be him since they made their choices.\n\nYou seem like you agree that that should be the vast minority of cases though. The majority are women who are perfectly able to work and don't need lifetime handouts or even short term hand outs. Divorce is expensive on both parties, not just the<b>  woman</b>.

                    "commentText": "Not really.  That's egalitarianism.  Feminism is primarily concerned with rights and special privileges for only women.  If feminism was really about equal rights then women would've always had to declare for the draft in order to vote, divorce court would not cater to women, and as they brought up at the end of the video... when a man and a <b> woman </b>have consensual drunk<b>  sex</b>, then the male would not be considered a rapist.  Those are just a few of the many examples of how rights ARE UNEQUAL but where feminists don't care because the inequality only affects men, not themselves. A feminist only cares about equal rights when it helps them, not men.  Feminists do not protest on the behalf of men when men get fucked over by the law (e.g., false rape accusations).  In Europe, 2 feminists (who were a part of a feminist organization) conducted a research study on the<b>  \"gende</b>r pay gap\" to see how badly women were affected being paid less than men.  To their own surprise, what the 2 feminists actually found in their research was the WOMEN were in fact actually getting paid more than men for the same work.  And, when the 2 feminists reported their facts to the feminist organization they belonged to, the feminist organization kicked them out, LOL!",

Let me clarify by stating that I'm not saying you have to believe in religion when I say this. I just don't you should use religion as an example especially when you say you don't believe in it. \nMany to most \"modern day feminists\" are bitter and blame men for everything. They don't even have to have ever been wronged or abused. Some may have been. However, you're saying @Jeffrey Youngblood is admitting  to having said that and he never did.\nThe PARTICULAR man you're speaking of and his comment were both stupid. That doesn't mean all men are like that. As women we have every right a man does. We can vote, choose any career we want and be in healthy relationships. We are very empowered as women in today's society. Claiming billboards and TV shows prove otherwise is silly. Choose not to be a victim of that mindset. There are many TV shows and billboards that I've seen showing the opposite. \nYou keep bringing up religion and when he answers your questions all you counter offer with is \"I don't believe in religion.\"  or you name call. That is typically why many feel the way they do about modern day feminists. \nThere's been a constant attack on men and how're they're continually wronging us. That's not true. \nMen are being attacked for being gentlemen, giving compliments or simply having an opinion anymore. As a very independent, strong and opinionated <b>  woman</b> I find those things ridiculous. It's embarrassing to watch women tear men down for those things. We should be happy knowing there are good men in the world. \nYes, there're men who are complete jerks in our society. At the same  time there're also women who're just as bad. \nI've seen women be abusive, lie about being raped and lie about paternity of a child.  Those are all terrible things. Just as terrible when a man does them. I think both sexes should be punished equally for those things. \nIf we want to be treated equally then we must treat men equally too. \nWe also shouldn't tear each other down or teach our children that we aren't equal.",

Did you know that female porn stars have the highest suicide rate of any industry?  2 weeks ago I got msgs and photos from a female friend whose partner had beaten her to a pulp. She has had a glass eye since she was a 12 year <b> old.</b>..he held her down and burnt her good eye with cigarettes. Now shes nearly<b>  blind</b>. How many news stories do you hear about women who abduct young boys and keep them a<b> s se</b>x slaves? How often do female sports teams pack rape a drunk boy? I think you're basing your opinion on a pretty white middle class example. Try thinking of other socio economic groups and then tell me there's no need for modern day feminism.  By the way...if it wasnt for feminism in the 1st place you wouldn't be able to read or write let alone publish your opinion.",

                    "commentText": "@TL W <b> Nobody </b>said that the media can't have an effect on females. As you clearly stated it also has an effect on males too. You said that every billboard, every verse from every popular religion, the tv and roles in society.. have humiliated and disempowered women. That's a huge false blanket  statement.  Sure those things \"can\" affect a person or it has happened to some people. However, it's not how you made it sound by saying \"every\" and saying that they humiliated and disempowered women. You are claiming victimhood for all women based on incidents that can happen to men and women. It's simply not true. Women as a whole aren't disempowered. \nNow you're talking about female porn stars being victims? I'm not going to judge anyone for their career choice but please don't expect sympathy from me for people CHOOSING a lifestyle. I do believe that some people, women and men, are forced into that lifestyle. (Ex.<b>  Sex</b> traffickers exploiting the innocent against their free will.) I'm sorry about your friend, I'm being completely sincere<b> , nobod</b>y deserves to be assaulted or abused. \nAs for you thinking there aren't women that assault or abduct young males.. don't be naive. It happens all the time. Maybe not as much or maybe because you just don't hear about those cases as often. I don't condone any violence towards anyone just so you know. Their have been many instances where women have falsely accused men of rape & that includes football players. You're arguing that it doesn't happen \"as often\" doesn't make it right. Wrong is wrong no matter who does it. Another thing modern day feminists love to do is label people. They love to generalize and assume they know it all too. Just like you did. You can take t<b> he ra</b>ce baiting BS and shove it. Yes, I'm white but I grew up with 4 brothers and 2 sisters. My parents worked their asses off and just recently retired. I grew up in the projects where my brothers were chased around by other boys with an axe. Those boys w<b> ere bl</b>ack but do I think<b>  all b</b>lack boys from the projects are like that? No I don't. I've worked from the time I was 16 <b> year</b>s old and have faced more problems in my life than many. I don't however think I have a bad life. As a matter of fact, I'm thankful that I was raised the way I was. I don't blame others for my problems and I am accountable for my life. You on the other hand seem to be blaming everyone for yours. Hell you're blaming men and everyone else for every probl<b> em any</b> woman has ever faced. Maybe you should sto<b> p usi</b>ng race, economics and identity politics for excuses. You'll always be a victim if you choose to be. I'm speaking from experience. Don't try to compare modern day feminists to actual feminists who fought for the women's right to vote.<b>  They're</b> nothing alike. Besides we have every right a man has. We can vote, do whatever we want for a profession and are every bit as free as a man. My parents installed morals, hard work ethics and God in my life. I raised my daughter the same way. So maybe stop blaming others, labeling people and playing the victim. You'll find out that you can do anything <b> you wan</b>t. Nobody has it easy and that is just life.",

Unless you're going to give me statistics on \"male sports teams who have gang raped women\" being greater than \"women who've made false rape accusations against male sports figures\". That's absurd and reckless. You're making that claim so you back up your facts. Modern day feminists are constantly outraged, playing victims and blaming everyone for everything. They claim to be defending women's rights but it's BS. They're just loud, hateful and act like they're superior than others. The #MeToo movement is a joke. It opened up the flood gates for women that think <b> sexual </b>assault is being looked at wrong or cat called. It made it harder for real victims to come forward. Some might have and some may have helped people cope. For the most part it was another SJW Hollywood flogging of men. They \"chose\" who to believe & who was guilty before due process. FYI I never said all women sexually exploited by former creepy employers were all actresses. You keep adding things that were never discussed and ignoring points that were brought up.

I said that I don't condone violence at all. I'm honestly sorry for what happened to you. You're not alone but I'm not going to defend a movement that was exploited by rich Hollywood elites. They chose who was good enough to be in the #MeToo movement and they destroyed people without due process. I saw way too much of \"he cat called me or he said I had a nice ass\" being used as a claim for <b> sexual </b>assault. You might get offended by those things but they're not assault. They made it harder for real victims to be taken serious. There were people like Weinstein that were monsters yes & I think he should burn in hell. \nWho the hell do you think I need to suck up to? Male approval? You're hilarious. Again you go back to bashing men. I don't need anyone's approval in life. I've ALWAYS ran my world sweetie!!  I just don't blame all men for the things that happened in my life. I have an amazing dad,  4 brothers, 7 nephews and many Uncles that I'm proud of. Not to mention good friends who are males. They aren't to blame for the men who treated me badly. See how easy it is to be able to separate good and bad?  \nI said that there are good women and good men. That there are bad women and bad men. Not good enough for you though. \nI called out bullshit and that was you. You focus on<b>  nothing</b> but the bad. You claim you're not a victim then stop using the victim card. You said you're equal in your circle of very hard men and women.. then why are you complaining?  You don't speak for all women. \n\nBTW go back and look.. \"I think you're basing your opinion on a pretty white middle class example\"  \n\nSo save me your loud, self righteous and sanctimonious bullshit. You label people you don't know anything about trying to make it fit your argument. Then when you're told FACTS you ignore them and you claim you never said it. \nAs for your comments concerning God & saying it might be over my head. You say he's imaginary.. then  you proceed to say he is used to control and dominate women. You can't have it both ways. Don't use God as another tool in your \"oppresse<b> d woma</b>n argument\" if you don't believe or claim he's imaginary and made up but still wields power. Your argument is just sad. \nFeminists are the attention seeking sucks sweetie. \nI'll always stand beside someone that has been wronged and fight with them. I won't throw groups of people under the bus because everyone is doing it and that's what I was told to do.",

She only did it because she is a women and couldnt catch a real criminal and I say that most sincerely with no level of joking. She did it because she was a weak, pitiful <b> woman </b>and she did the only thing she knew how to do which was to manipulate men with her body into doing something illegal for her. Sickening.  Young boys fantasize about one day taking care of  their girlfriend/wife/mother/sister  and protecting them and their kids when they are grown men, you used that desire to provide and protect for women against the boy because you are a weak fucked up<b>  woman</b>. I cant believe it. You think that boy will grow up to protect and care for women anymore? I bet you he won't.",

If a random 1 night stand decides she's going to use her right to not abort the accidental pregnancy she should be solely responsible for all that child's needs and if she can't provide the child should be offered to the father and other relatives of th<b> e woma</b>n and taken from her.\n\nYou can not allow women to decide who is born and who isn't and then require men to foot the bill. \n\nBeyond that even if they were married and decided together to have the kid and then split later and they both want custody whichever parent declares that they will forfeit their right to child support should get custody of the child. If they both forfeit child support then each parent should be assessed and the best fit parent should get primary custody. Depending on t<b> he a</b>ge the child should also have some say in who they stay with.\n\nThere's no reason to have a bias in favor of women in custody battles. There are statistics that show children of single mothers have higher rates<b>  of men</b>tal illness, physical<b>  and se</b>xual abuse, death, learning disabilities, poverty etc etc. If the bias should lean either way it should lean toward men having custody. \n\nMen should also have the right to forfeit parental rights and avoid child support. The same way women have the right to forfeit their parental rights by abortion or giving the child up for adoption without ever even telling the man she was pregnant by him. If a man te<b> lls a </b>woman he doesn't want the child she should only have the options of having the child and caring for it on her own or getting rid of the child (abortion or adoption).\n\nShe should never have all the power in deciding the fate of the child with the safety net of charging all the child's expenses to the man and the taxpayers. No one would be surprised how fewer children would be born each year if women didn't have all these incentives in mind.",

Rich women have complained about it in more recent times: And yes, for them it also does not make any sense. \n\nChild support? Well this is really simple: What is the average calculated cost for food, a healthy diet: And cost for basic clothing and things like that. Ok.. Ok. You calculate that. And this is what he needs to pay. Is his job at mcdonalds? Is he a dishwasher? A billionaire? It is all the same. What they need for the basics. You want the billionaire lifestyle? You need to keep sucking billionaire dick. \n\nI am still waiting for the feminist that will really explain this. Women are strong, capable people. Yet, they can not pay their own rent?

Same reason child support is decided by court - if it wasn't, a lot of men would high tail it without paying anything at all. So the courts decide if the men can't take their responsibilities seriously even during a divorce, then the court will be responsible for deciding how much is owed.\n\nAlimony, along with mandatory separation times, was always meant to ensure that women who function only as homemakers aren't just up and left by their husbands on a whim with no way to take care of their children or themselves. It serves as a punishment of sorts to ensure a man doesn't just stop supporting a wife who upheld her end of the marriage contract. Somewhere it devolved into \"every<b>  woman</b> gets it\" and that is totally counter to its original purpose and frankly, stupid. If you both have careers and are successful, if you are able bodied and can work, there is no reason alimony should be paid forever.",

Now, I'm 100% behind my body, my choice but ONLY if I get the same. I did not want that baby, and I have NO obligation to that boy. My sperm, my choice. If one person DOES NOT want a baby, an unwanted baby should not be born. Idc if it's heartless, or callous. I'm not a fucking criminal, and just for not paying some idiot I gave part of my life to IN HIGH SCHOOL, I can potentially get put into jail with REAL criminals, rapists, and murderers. That's America directly throwing an average law abiding citizen into harm's way over a moral issue, that involves money. And you can bet your bottom bitch America will get their money.",

And if the custodial parent can't financially hold up their half for a significant amount of time, then custody should be given to the parent who can afford that responsibility.

            "commentText": "\"I paid more child support than she really deserved.\"\n\nWhat about what the child deserves? This shows so much about him and it's not nice. \nBeing a single parent is incredibly hard and is not the same as being a single person and being able to work full-time and earn overtime etc. A single parent is massively disadvantaged in the job market. Therefore I don't think that it's unreasonable for the other parent to pay to help take care of the kids.\n\nAnd I don't think it discriminates against men that they have to pay for their own children. Their OWN children!!",

He made a heroic attempt to make us homeless and leave us with only the shirts on our backs.  He told the police I was literally whoring out my daughters (they laughed when they heard that one).  He continued to be addicted to oxy even getting released from jail.  He had a negative psych/drug evaluation that should prevent him from seeing his son without being tested for drugs.  Do you think he has ever been told he could NOT see his son?  Not by the courts.  The court falls all over itself to accommodate him, even after I showed he was stalking me online, even after I showed them that he sabotaged my online selling accounts.  I don't care how the courts \"victimize\" you weak men ... but courts go OUT OF THEIR WAY to accommodate the VERY WORST men, I can speak to that from first-hand experience.  lol ... and child support?

I still love him like family but he is outve control and has no respect from his mom I feel bad for his mom too because she tries to be a good parent and tries not to baby him but she can't help it and it shows in his personality plus she's had horrible luck with other man one dude was actually stalking her and showed up to her house and was<b>  psycho</b> and she can't move outve state or else she'll risk loosing custody from her son she still gets by but she's in this situation were she can't really do anything about it and I feel bad for her because she can't move on with her life and do the things she wants to do. But this is just a personal case if I had my own house and I raised a kid with someone and devoted everything to my kid and supported their mother it would be horrible for her to have the power to take that away and rob me of my money potentially for the rest of my life that's why I don't wanna get married I mean you never know who someone is you could be married to someone for ten years and then one day they just go bat shi<b> t craz</b>y and fuck everything up on the other hand it's hard to raise kids by yourself",

My mother never once complained about being a single mother, or needing money from my father, after the divorce. I've watched a man take off with our toolbox as a young teen. When my mother, mid 50s at the time, took chase I thought \"oh fuck she's going to kill him\". My mother is what you call the reason feminism is crap. My mom was born in 49, at the peak of women getting shit on and breaking out. She retired as a decorated veteran after almost 34 years being a damn savage. The most recent case of her \"fuck feminism\" attitude was a few years ago when she came to me holding the sub compact I had told her was in her cars middle compartment. I know she's a hell of a shot and definitely doesn't have problems handling firearms. apparently in the event of a car jacking, she prefers to fuck their day up with an aluminum bat instead. what the fuck is feminism",

They'd be shit scared to talk down to any Man.\n2. They'd be fucked in the work place, as no Employer would employ them (let's me real, what mother fucker is going to pay for a <b> Woman </b>to have a baby, as well as pay them to take more sick days as well as having them be less committed to work weekends and late nights).\n3. They'd have to fight in Wars (Against their will) in times of need.\n4. They'd now have to spend more time in Jail (as their sentence's would now be equal to that of a Man).\n5. During a Divorce they may end up losing half of their shit.\n6. They may be forced (against their will) to have an abortion if the guy loses interest in the<b>  Woman</b> i.e. way too many Women decide to get abortions after splitting up with their Boyfriends (it will now end up being both ways e.g. If I decide to split up with my pregnant girlfriend, where I don't want the baby, then she's getting an abortion whether she likes it or not).\n\n...And the list goes on.\n\nP.S.

If the guy who got her pregnant turns out to be a murderer and/or Pedophile (or something unforgivable by today's standards), get an abortion.\n\nBut if she decides to break up with the guy who got her pregnant, where out of spite she aborts his baby, then that should be a crime against nature.\n\nIf the guy decides he doesn't want to be a Father, but she still chooses to have the Baby anyway, then the Man should not be forced (against his will) to pay for the thing i.e. he doesn't want it.\n\nIf the<b>  Woman</b> decides she doesn't want to be a Mother, but the Man wants to still be a Father, then the solution would be for her to have the Baby, then when it's born she would hand over full parental responsibility to the Father (some may even say it's fair game for her to help pay for it, after all Men have been made to pay for Baby's they don't want).\n\nBut with the current Laws the way they are, Men don't get a say in any of it (but somehow us Men are still \"privileged\").",

            "commentText": "Problems with the divorce system do not invalidate feminism or have much to do with it at all. I have literally never spoken to a feminist who were concerned with making men pay more in divorces... I don't know the details (maybe it's stacked against the major income earner and he just assumes that to be a man, because in his case it was-- I don't know). But taking one messed up area or the legal system and trying to use that to say anything about feminism is <b> dumb </b>as a brick. Feminism by definition is about liberating women so that they are on a legally and socially equal level. Are there<b>  crazy</b> people who are feminists? Sure, there ar<b> e craz</b>y people who hold any kind of view. Those people are not doing right by feminism, and many feminists will tell you that (TERFs among others do not generally have good standing with sane, normal feminists). Making these mass generalizations about women not needing to push for equality in any area, because in ONE area of your life you felt you got the short end of the stick is just nonsense. The way this guy got screwed in divorce, women get screwed on virtually everything else, and only recently are beginning to approach equality. But this is yet another case of people making assumptions about things they don't know about... Why? I don't know-- they assume the experts who actually know about this stuff (people who stu<b> dy gend</b>er, sociology, etc.) must just be biased, because they generally agree with feminism... But they agree because they actually see the details of why feminism exists and what it actually aims to do. If you have to build this strawman where feminists actually want to create a matriarchy and hate men, then you have no argument. You're living in a fantasy world and feminists can't even give you facts, because they're arguing on behalf of what feminists actually believe... So you'll go on thinking \"Okqy maybe this one feminist is a moderate, but the ones who really set the agenda are craaaazy manhaters...\" But the ones who want equality, not female supremacy, are the regular ones. They are the vast majority of them. It's only because your argument doesn't hold water if you accept that there are only a handful of fringe people who believe anything close to what you're arguing against, and maybe, just maybe, feminism isn't the problem.",

I was always blazing but it didn't feel right to give her instead of have her join me for a smoke. Anyway me and my best friend we used to walk all the way to the city about 10 km (15 miles I think?) and back home to go get weed. In South Africa its cheap as fuck. It's like $2 -$10 for a dinebag. Above that is God Grade. So anyway we started having fun throwing eggs off of this pedestrian bridge over the highway. We only threw eggs at trucks cause cars could be a Big problem. She lived in an enclosed area next to the bridge. She promised us a whole tray of eggs for weed. She payed for the weed we made huge profit and we got like 8 eggs. Anyway that's the first part of my story. \n\nA year later me and my best friend drifted apart I was a lot less into weed had a new girl and stuff. Anyway on my way home my parents got a call from the schools office that I wasn't at school or something. We went back and this was a big deal in a way cause I had 100% school attendance since the First Grade. So we went back I told my dad to stay in the car and that I will quickly talk to the Principle. I got into his office and greeted him. When I sat down the first thing he asked me was 'Have you ever given anything to ~~~~~ (girls name)' .. fuckkk my heart sank cause I fucking knew she ratted. Basically I was under pressure with 3 adults being the Principal Vice and the Psychology type teacher (she knew me from the <b> age </b>of 5 I was best friends with her son) and this bitch pointed a finger at me and cried and said I got her into weed. I played<b>  dumb</b> and I kept asking questions on what substance are they saying I gave her. And that I have probably given he<b> r alcoho</b>l at a party and I know I am underage. You know playing the fool. Even after they say Weed. I started defending her to put on a show and implying how we were together forcing the idea of a bad breakup. I kept saying No she is a nice girl she wouldn't do that. But she was really really stupid . She bought weed from a guy in our school and started bragging to everyone how she had weed and by the end of the day someone told on her. She basically ratted out EVERY stoner in the school and she always put on stuff like she is a true stoner and stuff on her profile. Anyway I didn't rat anyone but everyone ratted my friend. I found him afterwards and warned him and I was out of the shitter",

I make just as much as the men next to me. I work just as hard. I choose not to have children because I can't be home to raise them. I don't need other women to speak for me. I don't need to be treated like a victim. I don't need a campaign on man spreading. I can speak for myself. Today's feminism is the same thing as the soft bigotry of low expectations. 99% of the men I encounter are decent people. They don't want to oppress me. Men are not our problem. They are our allies.",

The day that men abandons feminism, the feminist movement wouldn't exist. If women want to elevate themselves, then they should create stuff themselves, not tell men to give to them. You can see this everytime that they infiltrade a male dominated hobby. They want female only esports tournaments, financed by money from the regular tournaments. This is female nature, a negative aspect of it. They are wired to be materialistic, and grab resources whenever they can. It's a survival mechanism. Men can do it too, but they're more comfortable with living a modest life, and they don't have that same inner fear at the prospect of surviving on their own. And this fear is elevated for women with children.",

            "commentText": "This is one of the dumbest conversations I've ever heard. Joe Rogan, you really need to do more homework on the subject because you're clearly misinformed. Alimony in no way means that men have to pay for women who don't deserve it. It means that the Higher earning spouse pays x amount of dollars per month to make their incomes reasonably equal\u2014generally for one third as long as the marriage lasted. Meaning if you were married for 15 years you may have to pay alimony for 5, IF you happen to make significantly more than your ex spouse. I work at a family law firm and I can confirm that either party\u2014husband or wife\u2014can be ordered to pay alimony.\n\nAlso, there's no fucking way your friend has to pay alimony for the rest of his life unless he's a total idiot and signed a reeeeeaaaaallly shitty settlement agreement. Or there's something that you left out of the story, like he got to keep the million dollar house and the cars and their retirement and savings in exchange for an indefinite alimony arrangement.",

The vast majority of women are not oppressed in the Western world, we get preferential treatment both in child custody cases and in divorce proceedings. \n\nFeminism is infantilizing women and blaming men for it. Women (and men like this douche) need to learn that we are responsible for our own actions and finances, blaming men for every perceived problem you have in your life.  \n\nGrow the fuck up and stop listening to feminists.",

But buddy, you can't fool  women anymore. We have been using and abusing and omitting women and girls  for centuries and then as soon as they say \"men stop destroying  everything female\", we  start lying on women and begin making a bunch of videos and books, and articles. . Anyone with <b> common </b>sense knows that feminism tries to level the playing field and get respect for women. When will men get some decency in them. Are we men that evil? \n\n Tell you what men, let's try and do this. Let's stop sexually harassing coworkers, stop making nasty female body jokes, stop  groping them, stop raping them, stop groping them, stop molesting your daughters, stop making degrading porn, stop trying to control your daughters, stop trying to control your relationship, stop always thinking you ought to be the one selected to be the CEO, and just stop being an straight up asshole about everything. Women and girls deserve better. They are kind if fed up with our ridiculousness .",

I minored in women's studies in college I've taken many courses on the history of feminism and modern day feminism and the very subtle struggles that women deal with in modern day life. But the very core and foundation of feminism is equality. Meaning that women don't deserve to have it easier than men. And it certainly doesn't mean that men owe us anything. We deserve to be equal. I have watched every uncle and male cousin in my family have their lives ruined by alimony and child support. My grotesque sister cheated on my brother in law, they got divorced, and he is now homeless and living in a motel 6 trying to keep up with alimony and child support payments. He can't even support himself with all the money he's paying her. Often times he can't make the payments and it's right back to jail for him. But the most disgusting part is that her boys don't even live with her. Our parents are raising her kids and they pay for everything out of their own pockets and never receive a dime of that child support money. So basically my sister doesn't have to work a day in her life because she's living the high life off those alimony and child support payments. She's eating sushi and getting her nails done once a week, and she barely even knows her own kids. It disgusts me. That's anecdotal evidence to be sure, but anyone who is a real feminist will tell you that <b> sexism </b>doesn't just effect women. It effects men and<b>  gender</b> fluid people as well. A real feminist will tell you that most self-proclaimed feminists today are so angry that they've lost their way. Sure th<b> e patriarch</b>y is real, and in a certain way it's crushing men. Like women getting treated differently than men during traffic stops. That's extremely sexist towards women, but it's also beneficial for women and hurts men. That doesn't make it any less sexist. It's embarrassing to be a feminist nowadays. It's a dirty word with dirty connotations. I wish people would really educate themselves before going to bat for their \u2018cause'",

But you should also consider, for child support especially, that women take time off work to raise children- and if a couple decides to have the man financially support him, he should consider continuing this, after the divorce. But when the children grow <b> old,</b> the women are going to have missed out on their careers, so their financially worse off than they would have been without having the children.

By that logic a man who's been hurt has the right to hurt women. Feminists are hypocrite assholes who just like disrespecting men for the vindictive sake of it.

I told myself divorce wasn't an option. It's 'the lazy way out' for people who aren't willing to put in the work. Because of this, I blinded myself from realizing that I was actually married to a toxic person that was not willing to change as I was. I suffered in silence. I put myself through 5 years of that for the sake of working hard and not giving up. I try to see it as a learning experience, but I could have learned enough within the first two years before realizing it was unhealthy for me to stay. I forced myself to stay to be committed to the 'institution of marriage' as you put it. That's a very toxic mindset to have. \n\nWhat you're describing works for YOU, but don't assume it is the case for everyone else. There is no right or wrong way to handle life situations, you should be willing to adapt and make wise choices along the way. Stay in a relationship because you want to stay. Leave if you don't.",

I know a lot of this has to do with the biological element that makes us assume that a<b>  woman</b> would be the better care taker, however, this would also mean that she would have to take on the hunter role as well.

And as society has changed and women have become key breadwinners and more equal that law is in fact patronising and thus creates inequality against men now. And he's saying that some extremist and disingenuous feminists are advocating retaining that inequality as a form of equity; rebalancing the books, like a form of extreme feminst reparations. Except most traditional feminists like him see this as counterproductive and genuinely sexist. Because he believes in equality (of opportunity) not a long term equity (equality of outcome, which is technically unfeasible).",

Those are the situations that match the original situations those laws were intended for, in other words when one spouse has sacrificed their career for the purpose of taking on the housework and raising kids in full and allowing the other spouse to fully focus on their career. And this is exactly the same regardless of the sexes of the spouses. People who have spent potentially 20+ years of their prime career life out of work are most often not able to just hop back into work life and earn a pay to support themselves, whether it's a <b> woman </b>or a man. But if you have two career people who both have been earning good pay and continue to do so immediately after divorce? It's not fair for one spouse to be \"supporting\" the other after divorce, they don't need it.\n\nIt's been nice to see more stay-at-home dads get alimony from their rich ex-wives. If he sacrificed his career and personal income for the sake of her career by taking on the tasks of maintaining the house and kids, he is absolutely entitled to alimony. And if she sacrificed her career for the sake of his career in the same way, then she is entitled to alimony. That's how partnership works in the domestic setting.",

He has interesting discussions with intriguing guests but I often disagree with his statements.\n\nI do not support pornography and find that it has debased our sexuality, which should be a beautiful part of the human experience. Your knowledge of feminism however is lacking because there is a significant strain of second wave feminism that supports pornography and a woman's right to use her sexuality as she chooses. \n\nNext time someone makes a statement that you disagree with, may I suggest asking them for clarification as to why they feel the way that they do so that your response will be relevant, rather than a baseless diatribe.",

Which fits right into the definition of a male feminist.\"\n\nFirst thing grammar bruh, a comma is your best friend for fragmented sentences.  Also, questions usually with this, ?.\nSecond, if you think that male feminists are the poster child of \"positive masculinity,\" you haven't been keeping up to date with all the accusations of male feminists being <b> sexual </b>assaulters and predators.\nSo sex-positive feminism isn't supported by ethical and inter-sectionalism.  You know what, I actually agree with your statement, because this new intersectional feminism has abandoned the concept of \"women's choices & freedoms,\" and have embraced this authoritarian definition of equality that will hurt both women and men.  But I would like to see some evidence of those \"ethical\" feminists?",

It wouldn't even bare responding to, except that anti mfeminists at least sometimes try to pretend they have an argument and don't just state obviously false statements with no context or defense. lol I'm curious, what mainstream feminists have you ever read or heard say that they hate men? This seems like a comment left by someone who listens to morons like Sargon and Stefan Molynieux and just takes everything they say for granted, because \"They say they care about evidence and reason, so that must be true!\" But they don't. And they probably haven't read or listened to any actual feminist theory either. Feminism is about liberating women in areas where they are oppressed and achieving equal treatment. What does that have to do with hating men?\n\nThis statement actually beautifully mirrors when people say \"Trump voters are <b> racist.</b>\" But I have a funny feeling you'd take issue with that one. Guess what-- most Trump voters are not<b>  racist</b>, and most feminists (all but a tiiiiny fringe) are perfectly fine with men.",

If you get a divorce and you have children. Whoever keeps them gets payment from the ex-partner for the kids. Plus: the wife gets alimony to some extent to repay her for her opportunity cost (unless she currently earns more than her husband).",

            "commentText": "Feminists are giving men an unfair deal. Here's how: T. Russel says that women now want to be taken care of. That's the kind of feminism that women want now. They want to be taken care of in a <b> Patriarchy </b>way, like in Joe Rogan's example of a man married to a<b>  woman</b>, they had no kids, they got a divorce, and now this guy must pay his wife alimony for the rest of his life. That's insane in this day an<b> d ag</b>e. But where does this insane attitude come from?.....\n\nIt comes from what I call \"t<b> he o</b>ld deal\"....Which means for most of our history, men had to protect and provide for women. In return women gave the man children and was the center of his family. Men dominated outside the home, in the world of work and politics and economic competition. Women had their sphere, and men had theirs. This was kind of a deal worked out, by the sexes. Each side gave of something: men had more responsibility financially for <b> the wo</b>man, to make up for the fact that women were not his economic competitors outside the home, and they had to use all their energy for raising children. Men had the protector role, and so close to 100% of all combat deaths in history, were to men. And pretty much all hard and dangerous jobs in history have been done by men. In  return women were all about home and hearth, and children.... And that was a fair deal between the sexes, that lasted a long time. \n\nThen science progressed and the modern world was invented. In the 1800s infant mortality was still at 50%, and people lived short lives, and there were no jobs for women outside the home, so they worked at home. Then when science conquered a lot of diseases, people lived longer, fewer babies died, and places appeared in the world...factories and offices...where women could work outside the home, and compete economically with men, in large numbers. Birth control was invented and feminism came along, and this picture meant that women could work outside the home. <b> \"The</b> old deal\" was broken....women recently became the direct economic competitors to women, for the first time in history.\n\nWomen now became men's economic competitor's, and competitors for power of all sorts, in the world. Hillary is the latest example. Fina<b> lly a </b>woman had a serious shot at becoming President. Very soon we will have our<b>  first</b> woman President. And women under 35 now earn more money than men, in America, and the women under 35 in America earn more money than men under 35. So women will dominate the workplace, and eventually be the man's equal at work. At least half the <b> time, </b>a woman will be your superior at work.\n\nAnd that raises a tricky issue: As I said at the beginning, and as T. Russel says, women still want to be treated as delicate kittens, and protected, even though they are now a man's competitor for social and economic and political power. And that sets up a real conundrum for men: Is this a good new deal for men? My answer: No, it's a horrible new deal for men. \n\nHere's why: Women now expect us men to protect them and kiss their rear ends, lik<b> e in</b> the old days, when they could get pregnant at any time, were vulnerable, and were focusing on having children. But today  fewer children are being born, and women are at work, often being your superior at work....and competing with males at work, for money. And if you are not sufficiently compliant at work with women, you are labelled \"sexist\". Will men settle for this: for women bossing them around at work, and being often socially superior to them, at the same time as all men must, roughly speaking, kiss their rear ends, and cater to them, and protect them? Because that is the \"new deal\" for men. And it seems like this new deal between the genders won't work, to me. It seems like that is setting up a deal where women have much more power than men. Women now have the best of both worlds. They have the be<b> st o</b>f the old deal: protection and care, by men. And at the same time, they have the b<b> est </b>of the old deal, from a male perspective: like men in times past, they get to be socially dominant and compete outside the home......the best of both worlds.\n\nThere is something <b> in that</b> new gender balance package that doesn't feel right to me. It doesn't feel right, that men<b>  who m</b>arry a woman and have no children, should have <b> to cat</b>er to a woman, and pay her money, till the day he dies. That seems<b>  a p</b>art of the old deal, when women really WERE vulnerable and needed protection. It seems like men are being taken for a ride, by women and by modern feminism. This new deal is not at all fair to men, in my opinion. This new power relationship between the sexes will never last. I can tell that because of all the comments below.....!...It is far too unfair to men, to last. Eventually men will rebel and demand change. Joe Rogan has figured this out, because his friend is the one paying money to his ex-wife, for the rest of his life. Joe said that was insane, <b> in t</b>his day and age. I agree: Insane. Completely insane.\n\nWe need a new deal, between the genders.\n\n....no wonder The Men's Rights Movement, is alive and kicking.....",

In Australia, alimony (aka spousal maintenance) is given when one spouse has sacrificed an income to support the other spouse. For example, if I didn't stop working to help my <b> disabled </b>son, my husband would have had to. Therefore, he would not have been able to work full time and receive promotions. A % of his current income is thanks to me. In oz, we don't have lifetime alimony. It is generally only given for a few years and must be proportionate to the years together. Example - 10 years together would receive about 4 years of alimony. Maybe America just has a really fucked up family law system.",

All they do towards the kids is make a payment, but they conveniently skip over all the other perks the other parent doesn't have: more free time, more dating options, holidays, etc. The child support money is not about what SHE deserves or about whether or not SHE is able to make it on her own!

No wonder your husband left you and from my brother and other men who had to fight not only cunts like you but the courts who automatically give custody to women, even if they are unfit to be parents for custody of their children, I say double go fuck yourself and shove a hot curling iron up your <b> fat,</b> ugly, hairy, smelly<b>  pussy</b> for that comment about men just dumping the kid. Go fuck yourself you cunt, if anybody dumps their kids, it's more often the women that do it then men, especially if tha<b> t woma</b>n is 30 or younger. They demand custody not because they want the child, they see a payday and want the money and that child is usually passed around to family members or worse, the little whore straps her kid in the car seat and leaves it in the car on the side of the road, so she can go clubbing, not to mention all the fucking cunts who have killed their children because they couldn't cope or worse, their new boyfriend didn't want to be strapped with someone else kids so instead of leaving him, they strap their kid or kids into their car seat and then roll the car into a river or lake and just like every fucking cunt that has ever or will ever live, she blames someone else (my car was stolen or I was car jacked). \n\nThe best way I have ever heard<b>  a wom</b>an being described was from the movie, as good as it gets, when the romance novelist is asked how he writes women so well, he says :\"I think of a man, then I take away reason and accountability\". Even your last sentence shows what a cunt you are. \"I only get child support, no alimony (As I live in the UK) don't know UK family law but the way you wrote that implies that there is no alimony in the UK but if there was, you would have taken that too. In north America but especially the US, the cunts and courts bleed men dry. Why isn't acceptable for a man, any man, to tel<b> l a wo</b>man she can't have an abortion but it's acceptable f<b> or a w</b>oman to tell a man he has to pay for her decision to keep a child and because she is keeping the child he also has to pay her because she can no longer pursue whatever career or job path she wanted to.\nYou ever hear o<b> f th</b>e old expression, Women are like children ? It's not true. Women aren't like children, women are children. Whinny, bitchy, temper tantrum throwing children. If it's your decision and yours alone whether or not to keep or abort, the responsibility of whatever action you and you alone decide, should also be yours and yours alone, if not, then married men should be able to fuck as many other women as they want and you women must accept that because it's his body and you have no right to tell any man what he can and can not do with his body.",

Ever since 1964, you get paid by your work and job title, not other factors. Women will make less than men if they work less and vice versa. That is, of course, unless feminists start allowing more money for women for the same work, which would be bullshit. When I'm talking about socioeconomic equality, I'm referring to decreasing the gap between upper class and lower class. Allowing the poor to have more opportunities than they would normally have so they can have the same opportunities as someone born in an upper socioeconomic class.",

Feminists complain about the wage gap but then they refuse to work the  more dangerous, more physical jobs that pay more.  And also refuse to work longer hours {50-60 hours a week) especially when they have had children.\n\n\nFeminists want the vote but refuse to qualify for the draft and complain about taxes and having to pay for healthcare when white men pay more taxes than any other demographic in America.  \n\n\nFeminists embrace the <b> sexual </b>revolution and the birth control pill but run to the government when they choose a bad man with whom to have kids or when they accidentally get pregnant.  Women also destroy their capacity to pair bond in a relationship when they are<b>  sexual</b> licentious, then complain that a man won't date them after they have hit the wall.\n\n\nFeminists spearheaded the prohibition movement to take away men'<b> s alcoho</b>l because women chose drunks to marry, instead of having higher standards and choosing a more stable man and provider.  \n\n\nFeminism is just women's way to \"have it all\" but without the responsibility of the burden from bad decisions.  Men are burdened with these bad choices that women make to the determent of society.  And now women resent men because we have bent to all your demands; men lost women's respect years ago.  \n\n\nSo when all the money runs out and the government can no longer print money to devalue the dollar, women will be unable to waste time and resources in school.  Women will no longer have the luxury of being a single mother and being paid for it.  Women will no longer be able to divorce their men on a whim.  Women will have no choice but to return to men in supplication for protection and their resources.  And will be take you back?  I fucking hope not.",

Taking time and making sure that both are being sincere loving people.. if things go wrong you will be able to figure it out. If you choose the right person who loves you and if you are sincere and open you will find solutions even when the romantic love is gone and you decide to split up. If a man considers himself a good and sensible person he should wonder why he ended up with such a strange person as a wife. It's not about <b> gender.</b>. there are always bad people.. just make sure you don't end up marrying a bad person. I'm sure there are just as many guys who beat up their women as women who try to take advantage financially of men.",

They get children and the man wishes to stay working and continue his career and asks the wife if she is willing to take care of the household and the kids for 7 years until the children are a little bit older and go to school. The wife then tries to get a job again. She has: less years of building pension/ a major gap in working experience and career development/ less chances to get a well paid job at the same level as her husband. The husband has his kids and was well taken care of at home and also has the career. Bringing up a few small children and taking care of everything else is not a 'paid by husband' holiday. (It might be at times tougher than going off to work according to a few friends after staying home when the wife was struck by the flu.) They end up divorced.. Is it fair that the ex-husband doesn't make up for the difference in equal chances until the ex-wife gets a job that's paid like his? It isn't a free choice for many couples who are suffering financially and where someone sacrificed the career for the better paid person to continue working. Maybe it's also financially problematic to get your children in daycare. There are also many who still suffer from social pressure. Anyway wonder what they think of situations like this..",

A man can walk out on his kids, taking his paycheck with him and only be required to pay less than a quarter of his salary for the upkeep of 1 child and the system adds another 2% for each child after and only has to take them on weekends and holidays while the mom has to contribute everything she makes and raise the kids the majority of the time. Relax, the pendulum has already swung back in your favor. As for me personally, I was raised by two parents who made sure I was smart enough to never put myself in a position where I had to depend on a husband to buy my house or feed me. Unfortunately, most women were raised by men like you who would attack a <b> woman </b>in the comments section of youtube for trying to offer a less talked about perspective. Ultimately, a prenup would fix any problems men had in a divorce. If there's one good lesson Trump taught us it's that.",

This guy Joe Rogan's talking to is actually arguing AGAINST divorce laws that are unfair to men, which certain feminists have always done as well.  These kinds of laws are indeed saying that women need special protection -- therefore they are against <b> gender </b>equality, or against feminism.  Watch the frickin' video before you type!  \n\nIn fact, watch it twice, because some of you obviously don't understand.  You just hear the word \"feminism\" and you stop listening to what's actually being conveyed.  It reminds me that this country's really going down the tubes.  LISTEN to what a person is actually saying, why dont'cha?",

How about the fact that we have to pay women our hard earned money SIMPLY because they have a vagina? Nooooo, quick! Let's defend women and call something which is obviously stacked against men 'patriarcial' because I'm too scared to speak the truth!

You appear to have an ideology close to that of Ghandi, according to the website, who was a hardcore liberal socialist.  You aren't quite as far as he was according to the website, but you're close. It's possible that's not true, but I was just going by the website. The website does not indicate at all that I am a libertarian who wants to destroy the government-if you know who Milton Friedman was youll agree.\n\nTBH I'll give you that, I usually put more effort into my comments, as you can see now. I comment a good amount on youtube, so sometimes I don't put as much effort into it as I should.",

The fact you think that, only shows how little you have researched, and highlights that you really have no clue what you're talking about here.\n\nThere were sufragettes, the feminists.

No one else got to vote.\n\nThe push against giving women the right to vote was mostly from other women. You didn't know that either, did you? They were afraid that they would have to take on the same responsibility as men and need to sign up for the draft on top of getting the right to vote. But again, the vast majority of men didn't get to vote either. It's hilarious to me that the only way feminist theory works, is if you only look at the top tenth of a percent of men.\n\nMoving on....

                    "commentText": ">  'Can you name a single right I have as a man you don't as a <b> woman?</b>'\n    \n     It does not have to do only with legal rights. Indeed, it is pivotal, women and men respectively to share the same rights. Now we are talking about the West I guess, so when we say 'There is no<b>  gender</b> equality and feminism is indispensable' we mean that women have to face discrimination on a daily basis or they may be treated with contempt. Generally, when people judge someone based solely on th<b> e gende</b>r. \n\n> 'Also, there has never been an oppressed group of people that live longer, go to college at higher rates, get lower criminal sentencing for the SAME crimes, don't have to sign up for the draft to vote, etc. You aren't oppressed and feminism is a joke.'\n   \n  It depends on how much research you have done on that particular issue. For example, those women who contemn Feminism are at least hypocrites. They claim they do not advocate Feminism because they have never been victims <b> of patriarc</b>hy<b>  or sex</b>ual harassment. I'm not a victi<b> m of se</b>xual harassme<b> nt or patri</b>archy either but does that really mean other women are not oppressed? Does that mean other women had the opportunities I had in my life? Could you tell me h<b> ow the</b> woman was enfranchised? The feminist movement fou<b> ght for</b> gender equality and was against male privilege. Without that movement, the overwhelming consensus of women would not have the right to vote, to decide for their own bodies, take important decision on their own et cetera\n   We all know that when it comes to child marriage, girls are more likely to be married u<b> nder</b> the age of 18, aren't they? You may think that child marriage is not a thing in the West but it is indeed. To begin with, there is a law that says that a girl can marry someo<b> ne a</b>t the age of 16 with parental acquiescence. However, we do know that girls who marry<b>  und</b>er the age of 18 are more likely to find a partner who will abuse them; either physically or mentally or even both. It is essential to galvanize those girls to complete their education and be independent financially. In the United States, there are some states that <b> do n</b>ot have age limit for marriage\u2026 That means many girls may be married without their consent to older men and simply no one knows about it. \n   There are some religious communities which oppress women. In the UK, there is a conservative Jew community which oppresses women. We all know that religion is one of the biggest hindra<b> nces f</b>or the woman's emancipation.\n\n   In addition, many immigrants may come from countries where marriage with a minor is legal. They should be found and be punished. Many women who come from countries where FGM is a banality may continue this devastating tradition and cut their offsprings' genitals . Don't you think that these<b>  things</b> cause gender inequalities? Many of them discourage girls to pursue a career and convince them to focus on household chores. However, I do think that it would be better for them to complete their education because then they will be able to assert their rights, they will be able to know what is wrong and what is right.\n\n   Many women wh<b> o have </b>to face sexual harassment, abuse or rape may not reveal the truth because of trepidation. We have to educate those women and provide them with emotional support.\nAlso, some countries deprive the right of abortion.  Abortion is illegal in Malta and Ireland (I am not sure whether they changed it now). I'm inclined to believe that abortion should be legalized. I think it is violation of human rights<b>  to de</b>prive the woman of the right to get an abortion especially in certain circumstances. \n\n> 'Until then, stfu.'\n\nBy using inappropriate language, you will not get your message across. There is no point in using such words.\n\n> 'You have the right to bodily integrity. Men don't and are circumcised'\n\n   I do believe women and men respectively should have the right to decide for their own bodies. However, you can't compare FGM and male circumcision. Male circumcision has some health benefits. Men do not <b> feel pa</b>in during sexual intercourse after that. \n  On th<b> e othe</b>r hand, the woman experiences pain<b>  both p</b>hysi<b> cal an</b>d mental. The woman has to put<b>  up wit</b>h pain during sexual intercourse and she may even lose her life. I guess you know there are many types of FGM and each of them is painful.  FGM must be eradicated immediately. Now when it comes to male circumcision is should be optional.\n\n> 'How about how you have the right to vote without signing up for the draft and having the possibility of dying to get to vote?'\n\n    You are talking about the fact that women won't be required to register for compulsory service in case of war?\n If that is what you are talking about, I support that it should be compulsory for women. I think women should participate in combats and some women do it. Men are those who oppose it though. If you do a research, you will find out that a significant number of men think women should stay away from the army. However, women can contribute to  the army indeed.\n\n> 'How about reproductive rights?'\n\nIt depends on how you define reproductive rights. \nAccording to Wikipedia, reproductive rights are defined\n  \n\n\nReproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain th<b> e highe</b>st standard of sexual and reproductive health. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence.[2]\n\nI guess you have those rights. You can decide when to have childre<b> n an</b>d be provided with sex education. Women have the right for safe abortion, birth control,  freedom from coerced sterilization et cetera so I think you are wrong here.\n ><b>  All th</b>ings considered, gender inequality is linked with many problems such as violence, discrimination, illiteracy et cetera .We cannot overcome what we ignore and more importantly there can be no liberation for one of us if the other is not free.\n I would like to mention that I never said that men don't have to face discrim<b> ination</b> because of their gender. Indeed, men have to fulfill the definition of \"the man\". The reason for this is that we accept society to instill such ideologies into individuals. Men are associated with control and domination and women are expected to be demure and subservient. And whoever does not follow those stereotypes, it is not \"normal\". Men are apt to avoid expressing their emotions because of judgement.They should be reflective and expressive of their own feelings and responsive to the feelings of others.We have to teach boys emotional literacy. If we can give them emotional vocabulary and the encouragment to use it, they will unclench their hearts... That will<b>  lead t</b>o the depletion of gender inequality because you won't have to be a certain way because you was born a male or a female.",

                    "commentText": "Carolina V. I can't make it through that word salad. Let's break this down to one topic here. I'll let you pick one if you want.\n\nI just want to ask a very simple question first and hopefully you'll see your own hypocrisy in what you just said regarding circumscision. This is coming from someone who has worked in medicine for over a decade too. You said there are health benefits for men to be circumsized. Would that justify female circumscision? Because that has health benefits too. Like, not catching HIV as easily, just the same as men who are cut. I ask, because I guarantee that you will disagree that's reason to do it to a <b> woman.</b> Yet, for some reason it is for a baby male. Why? The equivalent to male circumscision would be removing the entire clitoral hood. In vitro, that develops just the same and later when<b>  sex</b> is set, it grows a little different. The same problems with female circumscision, also happen with males. The glans, or head, of the penis, is meant to be internal and a mucosal membrane. When you remove the foreskin, which is a very specialized body part with hormone receptors, specialized nerves, etc. Anyways, when you remove it, it dries out. If you removed the clitoral hood, the clitoris would do the exact same, and dry out. However, most female circumscision isn't that extreme. In about 90% of the cases, it is a pin prick and completely heals. Not the case with men. I don't know where you are getting your info, but many European countries are banning male circumscision because it is inhuman and immoral to do to someone who can't consent. Which, consent is the highest issue for me. Why not let them decide when they are 18 and above? I'm more interested in why you say medical benefits justify it for men, but would never say that about women? I'd say because you see men, just as most of society does, as less important and more disposable than women. You just do it on a subconscious level and don't realize it until it is pointed out. \n\nPlease don't go off the rails again. If you address my question about circumscision, I'll let you pick any topic you want, and have a little debate on it where you'll lose. You can pick rape culture, the wage gap, education, or really anything you want pertaining to feminism and I'll show you why you are mistaken. You have to stay on topic or we'll just go in circles.",

And that's why Male circumcision is not illegal. If you can compare those things, that shows that you don't know anything. However, I said women and men respectively have the right to decide for their own bodies and male circumcision should be optional. You didn't even read what I said? 'Cause that's what I meant. I said \"MEN SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE FOR THEIR OWN BODIES\" and some men do it because they want it. And if you have read all my comment, you would have known that I don't agree when parents can make such decisions. And obviously FGM is much worse especially the type 3 so don't come here without knowing what FGM is. The procedure has no\u00a0health benefits for girls and women.

Do you even know why circumscision is so popular among males in the US? Because Kellogg, yeah the cereal guy, was very religious and pushed and pushed to perform this operation precisely so male<b>  sexual</b> sensation would be blunted. It's actually why he made the cereal too. It was supposed to be bland, and bland food was supposed to reduc<b> e sexua</b>l desire. \n\n You are going to tell me, someone with a masters degree in biology and anaromy/physiology, that I don't know what I'm talking about? That's completely absurd. You mam, are grossly misinformed on this topic. And no, I'm not addressing all of that, because it would be well over ten pages worth of refutation. I don't have that kind of free time. This is already going to be many paragraphs for me to address just one of these topics. \n\nI know the differences. Type 3 is incredibly rare. I also told you that MGM is the female equivalent of removing the entire clitoral hood, anatomically they're the same thing and develop almost identically. It would border on type 3 female circumscision. It has a marked and objectively testable decline <b> in sexu</b>al sensation for males. Saying otherwise shows me you have no clue what you're talking about when it comes to anatomy and fetal development. Stop projecting and saying the person with a masters degree in anatomy and physiology is clueless, because that is absolutely laughable. Maybe listen to the person with almost 15 years dedicated to the study of the human body and learn something? \n\nThe health benefits do NOT out weight the risks, and is precisely why most European countries no longer do it. The only publications you will find that say it has medical benefits, are places in the US, getting kickbacks from the places and groups that monetarily gain.\n\nAlso, I don't know where you get your information from. I'm guessing heavily biased sources that agree with the ideology you subscribe to. Which, is called confirmation bias. It isn't coming from world renowned medical journals. Female circumscision does lower the risk of getting an std. But again, why does that only justify it for <b> one gen</b>der? No clue who told you that female circumscision has no health benefits. It demonstrably and objectively does. The issue is, do those benefits outweigh the risk and damage to the body? I'm not a monster, so I say no it doesn't in any circumstance. Just because it has medical benefits is not an argument if it doesn't go both ways. It's hypocritical at best. The foreskin has such specialized cells, that it is used, again <b> with </b>zero consent, in very expensive anti aging creams for women. If it gets banned, people like Oprah will no longer be able to push their baby penis parts face creams. Sickos...\n\nI'll say it one more time. Cutting off the foreskin is almost identical to removing the clitoral hood. They both serve the exact same function. Which, is to create a mucosa membrane on the most sensitive part of <b> human s</b>exual organs, male and female. Now that you know that, why is it OK to do it to men and not women? You want to outlaw even the most mild forms of female circumscision. All the while, don't think we should outlaw a very extreme version of it on male babies who can't consent. You say they should have the choice. However, if you don't outright ban it, you are throwing consent out the window and letting others, the parent, make the decision for them.\n\nYou say you won't continue if I don't address everything you said. I barely covered one topic here and am keeping it vague. I don't think you'll be able to follow if I get too far into medical terminology. I'd honestly guess you are a college aged female, def not studying any STEM, probably a<b> nother </b>gender studies or humanities student. They're the only people with enough hubris to argue biological FACTS. \n\nI was trying to hit the reset button so we don't get into the weeds on these other topics. I don't think you would leave because of me not addressing those issues. It's because you know that if you stay on the circumscision topic, you'll get owned. You've already shown me your knowledge of the human body isn't even on par with a first year student. Judging by what you said, id be surprised if you've even done any basic biology, much less study it on a grad student level. If you don't respond, I don't really care. You aren't going to teach me anything on this topic as I'm light years ahead of you on the human body and the functions thereof. Plus, you are fine having parts of little boys dicks cut<b>  off ya</b> weirdo.\n\nDo me a favor and watch a few circumscision videos on here. Sounds like you've never seen the procedure actually performed. Then, you come back and tell me if that baby is happy about it. Or, screaming because they are clearly in pain. There are more recent studies, not the 1960s crap you are going off of. Well that, or whatever your humanities prof told you, who also happens to not have an education in biology whatsoever.\n\nYou are really just threatening to do what every other feminist I've ever talked to does. Which is, end the conversation before your illogical argument gets torn to shreds. Like I already said, <b> you have</b> nothing to teach me on this subject and are clearly making an argument from emotion, once again... No surprise there. Then, tell me if I don't addres what would be 10-20 pages of text, and I'm not doing that on my phone. To follow that, I don't care to talking to baby mutilators anyways. So, you do you.",

It demonstrably and objectively does.'\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization FGM has no health benefits, and it harms girls and women in many ways. (see ;  [LINK]  This video is from the organization I mentioned above where the Director-General dr. Tedros puts emphasis on the fact that Female Genital Mutilation has no health benefits. Also, I find the claim that I am not informed about this issue grossly inaccurate. \n\n'Now that you know that, why is it OK to do it to men and not women'\nSeriously, I don't know if you understand but I said 'Men and women respectively have the right for bodily autonomy and informed consent. In my initial comment, I stated that I do not support when procedures can be done with parental acquiescence. I said the exact opposite; It is a violation of human rights to take pivotal decisions without the person's consent. His body, his choices and her body, her choices. \n However, sometimes Male Circumcision is necessary. For instance, in the case of phimosis (the inability to retract the foreskin) may be recommended. Male circumcision is linked with some health benefits such as a reduced risk of stds in men and protection against penile cancer.  However, there are some risks as well. If a man over the <b> age </b>of 18 believes that the risks are outweighed by the health benefits then he can do it. That means that the law that allows children to be circumcised with parental consent must be abolished.<b>  Nothing</b> more<b> , nothin</b>g less. \n'They're the only people with enough hubris to argue biological FACTS.'\nBut I'm not the only one who argues that FGM has no health benefits. There are studies that clearly state there are no health benefits and there are little to none evidence that support your claims which means there is no valid evidence. You're welcome\n'I'm light years ahead of you on the human body and the functions thereof. Plus, you are fine having parts of little boys dicks cut off ya weirdo'\nYou have to learn many things from me indeed. And that is because I have been devoted to this issue for a couple of years now. I have talked with both women and men who were circumcised. The reason why over 200 million girls and women had to undergo Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) was neither for their health nor for any serious reason. I will outline the basics. \n Initially, a girl is considered to become<b>  a wom</b>an in many of the cultures that still practice FGM. Also, some cultures believe that FGM enhances fertility and promotes child survival and the external female genitalia are considered dirty and unsightly and are removed to promote hygiene and provide aesthetic appeal.\n  Some girls believe they will not find husband if they are not cut.\n'Type 3 is incredibly rare.'\nAccording to one 2008 estimate, over eight million women in Africa are living with Type III FGM. If that number is insignificant for you, then you should reassess your values. \n.Women have to f<b> ace sex</b>ual problems (decreased satisfaction, pain du<b> ring se</b>xual intercourse), psychological problems, need for later surgeries et cetera \n'Do me a favor and watch a few circumscision videos on here. Sounds like you've never seen the procedure actually performed.'\nI guess you are so pissed off about the fact that so many minors have to undergo male circumcision that you are unable to listen to what I have to say. Can you tell me where exactly I said there is an excuse for making decisions for someone else? \n I said if a man wants to go under the knife, he can do it. However, I have never met a s<b> ingle </b>woman who is educated and wants to undergo FGM.\nIf a man thinks circumcision enhances the way of living, he can do it. He has the right to make decision for himself and decide for his own body. \n'who also happens to not have an education in biology whatsoever.'\nYou came here to talk about your career? It really surprises me that the only thing you do in each paragraph is to talk about how many years you are in the field. The thing is, no one really cares. People are apt to care about facts and not for what diplomas you have earned in your life. I thought I had to deal with an educated adult and not with someone who is here to talk about such things. And FGM is not even about Feminism; is about humanity, is about the insensitive people who put their children's lives at risk because of cultural or religious reasons. \n  FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND MALE CIRCUMCISION RESPECTIVELY FOR RELIGIOUS OR CULTURAL REASONS ARE MORALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND THE LAWS THAT ADVOCATE PRODECURES WHICH PUT YOUR LIFE AT RISK MUST BE ABOLISHED IMMEDIATELY.\nI hope, I was pretty clear and I won't have to repeat it again. Not only is male circumcision sick for minors but also recording such acts is disgusting.\nI could list what I have achieved in my life as well but no one really cares for what I have studied. What matters the most is what I have to say.\nFurthermore, I can't really understand your way of thinking. I'm not afraid of \u00abgetting owned' because I know for what I am talking about and secondly I don't think there is a link between conversations and fights. I guess you were taught in High School and your brilliant career that conversations do not have a winner or a loser. Conversations play a significant role in the development of our personalities. You learn and you make other people think. That way you expand your mindset and you become tolerant. In middle school or high school , yes we used to believe that if you could prove the other person wrong, then you were the winner and the other person was owned. I didn't expect a person with SUCH A BRILLIANT CAREER to have this mindset. I lose my hope for humanity.\nYou asked me for reproductive rights and for some other things and I answered to all of them because I wanted my points to be raised. \n I don't mind talking about Feminism and also I don't mind continuing talking about Male circumcision and FGM as long as you read my comments and stop making assumptions. \n'I don't care to talking to baby mutilators anyways.'\nIf only you read my comments. You act childish\u2026 \nNo matter how many years you have studied, by telling me to 'stfu' or ignore my points shows that y<b> ou are n</b>othing more than an uneducated person. Because attending a university does not make you educated. \nI can't understand why you continue talking about babies that are circumcised while I have stated that making decisions for a minor that will affect his or her life is a violation of human rights. If you can't understand that then I guess there is more air in your brain than brain <b> cells.\n'm</b>isandry'\nI am not sh<b> owing my </b>misandry \u2018cause I do not advocate male circumcision <b> unde</b>r the age of 18.

All I will say, is try reading your sources before posting them'\n\n   So you claim the World Health organization spreads falsehoods and has biased information? Not only does WHO oppose Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) but also a number of other national and international organizations because of its harmful physical and <b> mental </b>effects. \n  Studies suggest that FGM is linked with an increased risk of HIV infection. I have done an extensive research on this particular issue and the only ones who advocate this practice are the individuals who are followers of a religion\u2026 I think that says everything.\nThere are no health benefits for FGM and the only reason some communities practise it is due to religious or cultural purposes (I have already mentioned why FGM is promoted)\n\n>'I'm referring to lesser versions of it as those are the vast majority.'\nI can't understand how you claim FGM has health benefits while so many<b>  doctors</b> and health organizations demand its abolishment because of global health and human rights,\nAlso, you should fathom that the type of FGM that is chosen depends on many factors and each of them is painful and devastating and may have many implications. The United Nations and other organizations have stated that there is no tolerance for FGM.\n\n>'There is no justification for male genital mutilation, because that's what it is per dictionary definition.'\n \nYes but that is something males will decide. Some adults come to the decision to go through this process. The problem is not the male circumcision, the problem is when young boys have to undergo this procedure without their consent. If an adult believes the benefits outweigh the risks, he can do it. He will decide what is better for his life. The only thing I said is you cannot compare FGM with male circumcision. Male circumcision is devastating because the boy was not asked. The difference between FGM and Male circumcision is that FGM has no health benefits and it is always practiced for non-medical reasons. On the contrary, some men even when they are older decide that this is what they want after a research. \n\n>'This is an issue I take very seriously. I just feel that anything short of advocating for the outright banning and outlawing of this rediculous practice is causing harm to many, many men.'\n\n  I can't understand how Feminism is involved in this particular issue. I bet that if all countries wanted to outlaw and ban this procedure, no feminist would oppose it. This statute would be opposed by religious groups such as Muslim or Jews communities. Religion has always been the biggest hindrance for the human's emancipation. That means you should blame religious groups.\n\n  Have you ever tried to talk about it with religious people? Because when you mention male circumcision and if you say that you support to outlaw it, the overwhelming consensus will get offended because it is their 'right' to apply those procedures in their communities as they claim.\n\n\n>'I honestly believe the modern wester<b> n woma</b>n is the most privileged group of people that has ever walked the face of the earth.'\n\nYou mean the average weste<b> rn wom</b>an\u2026. Everyone can point to women who are abused either physically or mentally, women who are treated with contempt, women who are raped, girls who are forced to be married without their consent, girls who are discouraged to pursue a higher educati<b> on, gen</b>der inequality et cetera\n As long as those problems exist in the Western World, the feminist Movement will be indispensable. Also, the feminist movement is not only a group of women to be enfranchised  . Women who were raised in free societies should speak the truth and speak for the voiceless. The feminist movement did fight for<b>  the w</b>oman's emancipation and did assert our rights. That's the truth.\n\n > 'identity politics has been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions of people in the 20th century. However, not of the people who witnessed that have now passed away and it looks like we have to learn that lesson all over again now. We are moving to a point where an individuals group identity matters more than the character of the individual.'\n \n\n I can't really understand your point. Isn't identity part of your character? And do you know how identity politics is responsible for the deaths of an enormous number of people? Because of people who are extreme. Moderation is the key for everything. People protest for being discriminated against while they discriminate against other groups of people. It is necessary to assert your rights when you see that people are prejudiced against other group of people. Because you can't leave it like that. For example, if you let people believe that the affluent members of society are superior to the destitute, that will impinge on the people's conscience. Many people even nowadays are treated differently because of <b> their nation</b>ality or the colour of their skin... Shouldn't they protest for equality? And it is not even necessary to belong in this group to protest for inequality.\n\n\n>'But, what does it look like when the left goes too far? Is that possible? How would the leading up to it look?'\nIt depends on your definition of 'too far'. However, the left has received criticism and many individuals have judged them for trying to instill wrong ideologies into the people.  The left is wrong in many things that are not related to Feminism. Also, the fact that some women who claim to be feminists does not mean they are. It is like saying every single Musli<b> m is a ter</b>rorist.",

                    "commentText": "Carolina V. Annnnd I'm done. You are either only reading parts of what I am saying. Or, being intentionally obtuse and putting words in my mouth. The point of bringing that up was to make a hypothetical scenario and ask you a question about it. You said male circumscision was sometimes beneficial for health reasons. Instead of answering the following question I asked in a straightforward way. You are choosing to get into specifics of the actual medical reasoning. Which, has absolutely <b> nothing </b>to do with why I asked and gets off the subject, I'm guessing intentionally. If we are going to say that male circumscision can be done for medical reasons. Would that argument hold up for justifying female circumscision? And, we can even say what if it did so we don't have to discuss the actual benefits or lack thereof, because that has<b>  nothing</b> to do with the original question I'm asking. \n\nI told you that study is ONLY looking at the most extreme method where the entire clitoris and clitoral hood is removed, and I said it wasn't a fair analysis because that is a very small fraction of the female circumscisions that are performed. Of course doing that is going to have adverse affects. Just like with a male, and chopping off the entire glans, or head of the penis. It's going to cause that organ to malfunction, because that is a crucial part of the anatomy. \n\nI guess I need to explain the disease process of stds to you now. The clitoral hood creates a mucusa membrane underneath where things like bacteria can more easily get deposited, and then stay there longer because it's a great place for bacteria to grow. There is also the issue of having a clitoral hood become very tight, just like a male getting phimosis. That isn't a reason to just up and cut the damned thing off though! There are stretches a person can do in both cases to fix it. Most people don't even know that a foreskin is NOT supposed to be retracted until well into puberty. A lot of people seem to think you need to retract it when they are still babies to clean there. That's wrong wrong wrong and any doctor who says to that needs to go back to medical school. That was the practice much earlier before antibiotics could easily be used in the case of infection. We don't just up and die from infections anymore. So, worrying about an infection there and chopping that off is absurd.\n\nGoogle the function of a male foreskin and how it develops, and then I think we can talk. It has special signaling cells that cue the body to make certain hormones. It also has special nerve cells and removing the foreskin absolutely reduce<b> s sexua</b>l feeling and orgasm intensity. Guys who are cut also ha<b> ve s</b>ex differently. Ones who are tend to h<b> ave </b>sex and try to go much deeper and faster. Guys who are uncut tend to go slower and be more gentle as they tend to be more sensitive there. Please watch a YouTube video of the procedure actually being done. There are also studies, and feel free to look them up, that show when that is performed on a baby, it causes permanent changes in the brain that appear on mri scans very much like ptsd.\n\nWe need to be trying to outlaw circumscision, period. If you look at studies from Europe that are much more free of financial influence than the stuff written in the US now. You will see that they are calling for an end to the practice for males as well because with the advances in medicine like antibiotics now make it so the benefits no longer outweigh the risks. Hell, a lot of these procedures being done in less developed countries are not done with clean surgical equipment. Many places still have rabbis who do the procedure with no actual medical training, and then using there mouths to clean off the blood. Which, has given herpes to countless male babies even in the US. So again, circumscision should be outlawed across the board. We shouldn't say fgm in one instance, and then call it circumscision when it is done to a male. By dictionary, and even medical standards, they are both mutilation. I took an oath when I started my career in medicine. First, do no harm. Unless a foreskin is so infected or deformed that it needs removed because of a risk to human life, it's a sick practice.",

                    "commentText": ">    'You are either only reading parts of what I am saying. Or, being intentionally obtuse and putting words in my mouth. The point of bringing that up was to make a hypothetical scenario and ask you a question about it. You said male circumscision was sometimes beneficial for health reasons.'\n\n     Yes exactly. However, I've never said you MUST do it. The fact that male circumcision is linked with some health benefits does not mean you have to undergo this procedure if you do not want to do so.  You are quibbling about it  while the only thing I said is that FGM and Male circumcision are two different procedures but both of them are devastating without your consent because you have the right to decide for your own body.\n     You should re-read my answers and see that from the beginning I stated that I STRONGLY BELIEVE EACH SINGLE PERSON SHOULD DECIDE FOR HIS/HER OWN BODY. AND IF ANYONE DOES THE OPPOSITE, THAT IS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. \n\n   >'Which, has absolutely <b> nothing </b>to do with why I asked and gets off the subject, I'm guessing intentionally.'\n \n     I stated that there are not health benefits for Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).  I thought you claimed there are health benefits and I cannot leave such references like that. \n'If we are going to say that male circumscision can be done for medical reasons. Would that argument hold up for justifying female circumscision?'\n    Okay, let's consider Female circumcision had some health benefits, it would be okay to undergo this procedure ONLY IF YOUR DOCTOR SAID THAT IT WAS NECESSARY OR MANDATORY FOR THE PERSON'S WELL BEING OR THE PERSON'S LIFE WAS AT RISK.  \n     But FGM/C has no health benefits and can cause long-term health problems. And by FGM/C we mean everything, cutting, removing, piercing and/or sewing closed all or part of a girl's or woman's external genitals for no medical reason. And believe me, NO SINGLE GIRL WHO WAS CUT IN THIS WORLD WAS CUT FOR 'MEDICAL REASONS'. The overwhelming consensus is cut for religious duty, cultural reasons, condition of marriage et cetera\n That means, girls are cut not for their own 'hygiene' but because they have to do it for men. You should do a research and see the reasons why FGM/C is applied. First of all, they want to decrease the woman's<b>  sexual</b> pleasure and do not want her to hav<b> e sexua</b>l desires whereas others claim this disgusting procedure is applied because it increas<b> es sexu</b>al pleasure for the man. The women who cut their daughters do not take into account their health, because if they actually did, they would not practice FGM/C.\n >'Google the function of a male foreskin and how it develops, and then I think we can talk.'\n \n   Yes, I know about it but I can't understand what is your problem. And I can't actually understand what makes you think I am clueless about this particular issue. You seem to focus on the fact that minors have to undergo this process. \nThe thing is I have never said the foreskin is something useless that must be cut. Also, I never said that someone should do it for no medical reasons. That means that you do not have to remove something of your body unless it lowers the quality of your life or put your life at ri<b> sk. Noth</b>ing m<b> ore, not</b>hing less. The fact that male circumcision is linked with health benefits does not mean that those health benefits outweigh the risks. I hope you understand what I am trying to say.\n You should do a research and see why some guys  ove<b> r th</b>e age of 18 want to undergo this procedure. There are religious, cultural, medical reasons. So if you ask me, YOU SHOULD NOT REMOVE ANYTHING FROM YOU BODY IF THAT PART OF YOUR BODY DOES NOT LOWER THE QUALITY OF YOUR LIFE OR PUT YOUR LIFE AT RISK.\nAnd the fact that some guys want to undergo this procedure for no medical reasons is the truth. You should ask or google it and you will find how many of them did that without being necessary.\n  >'There are also studies, and feel free to look them up, that show when that is performed on a baby, it causes permanent changes in the brain that appear on mri scans very much like ptsd.'\n\n  WHEN DID I SAY THAT I PROMOTE MALE CIRCUMCISION IN THE FIRST PLACE? \nI said that it must be illegal to do such things to a minor. Everyone has the right for informed consent and bodily autonomy. That is what I said. And I added that the only group of people who would fight against it would be religious groups, neither me nor the feminist movement, only the religious groups.\n  >'So again, circumscision should be outlawed across the board. We shouldn't say fgm in one instance, and then call it circumscision when it is done to a male'\n \n   I got tired of repeating myself\u2026. Like, you come here to blame me for something I never said? Are you serious?",

I completely understand why men don't want to get married anymore because there are no benefits for him. if (when) he gets divorced the court systems put in place will eat him alive by taking away his custody rights, child support, possibly alimony, and it takes YEARS to get these things settled, because for some reason divorced women are like pit bulls out for blood, and those vengeful bitches will do whatever they can to make his life HELL while she's living it up with a new man. meanwhile, these poor guys souls have been sucked out ,and they're just a shell of their former selves. it's embarrassing that women act in such ways now. I'm not saying all, but a good enough portion do. women already have life easier than men. there is no need for feminism to exist in the western cultures anymore.",

It's not <b> sexism </b>against women, because the premise is not that women are somehow<b>  handicapped</b>, or weaker and in need of extra protection.

Superior from birth. They say so themselves \"we women are superior\". But, and this is key, not superior in a meritocratic way of \"I'll show you how superior I am by inventing stuff, curing disease and making tons of money\". Instead, superior by virtue of possessing qualities that entitle them to live off others. In one word: aristocratic.",

Because if you cannot prove that it didn't happen, you will be found guilty. I know several men that got stomped in court on false allegations against women with no hard evidence and I have honestly never heard of a divorce case that had a favorable outcome for the man. It's just as plain as the nose on your face. Women are dominating men in the US at no fault of the men and at no merit of the women.

In fact it presumes innocence until proven guilty 3) there's never CCTV so the rape rarely ends in a conviction 4) many men beat their gf but it happens at home behind closed doors where there's no evidence 5) in divorce men hide their assets in trusts & companies to avoid a fair divorce settlement 6) men can usually hire better legal teams.",

A good friend of mine has two daughters with his ex wife and when they were only 1yr and 3yrs <b> old </b>the mom took off to another state with a new guy. It took my friend 7 years to locate her and then get the courts to force the mom to let him see the girls. Sadly the mom had 7 years to brain wash the girls against their own father and no matter how hard he tried there was no getting through to them. The girls are now 18 and 20 and have cut off all communication with their dad. It's heart breaking for him and what the mom did is disgusting. Too many women seem to get the idea that the children are somehow more hers than they are the dad's and when they no longer want the man they think he no longer has rights to the children. Judges should give full custody to the dads in cases like that.",

I just want them to stop, I want my dad to get a car and a house, I want him to get a shorter job because he comes home at 8:00 and I get home from football practice at like 9:00 I have to take the bus when I'm with my dad. I do not like it, but my dad is a feminist and he says women are paid less than men. He pulls up his sources but when I offer to pull up my sources he says no I am wrong. My mom does the same thing, so does my brother. My grandmother is the only one who understands. I can't stand being the only logical person in the family, please help.",

We have a friend who made more than her lazy husband who was a \"writer\" that sat around and never wrote anything.  He was just leeching off of her for years and cheating on her at the same time.  (We found out about it before she did, but we tried to stay out of it).  When he found a girl that he really wanted to be with he left our friend and sued her for alimony and he won.  So basically he got paid for years to test out women until he found one he really wanted and still gets paid for it years later.  So I wouldn't call this law sexist because it does happen to both sexes. But there are definitely problems with it.",

But i will agree that women always say the 'system' is against them but contrary to popular VAGINAL belief; the system is ABSOLUTELY for them. There is no natural or civil right that a <b> woman </b>is deprived of today and they STILL bitch as if thats actually real. A<b>  woman</b> can go work the same amount of hours, days, weeks, months, years in the same job and make the same pay and yet 45% of soon to be women today (16-21) just want to find a man to pay through their entire life. The worst part about it is that there are women who actually manipulate a man for financial stability and call it 'chasing a bag' or 'finessing.' Like how evil can you get? Moral of the story: when you find a good girl; respect them, protect them, help them, appreciate their life and their time they afford you but if you find a girl thats just like any other basic ass bitch, SEND THEM.",

That's why I don't believe your story. \n     Seems like You rushed here, to create a scenario to try to prove that mothers abandon, and  do the same things as dads. Smart aware people, see this. .

It's not the <b> patriarchy </b>that demands women be taken at their word in regards to rape, it's feminism. Read any Salon or Huff article or anything written by ANY prominent feminist in academia on rape and you'll see time and time again these women calling for \"believing the victim\". Sadly, none of these people ever express what that means exactly. They won't because what they want is to provide women the power to throw men in jail without evidence. Rape is fucking awful and it really fucking sucks that it's so bloody hard to prove. There is no doubt some women freeze up after saying no a bunch of times and just go<b>  limp</b>. There is no doubt the men who fuck those women know they are fucking them against their will. But how do we, as a society, handle a situation like that. If there is video of it, yah, throw that dick away, but without video you're not going to have any evidence. There will be no signs of a struggle. It's a shitty situation, but we can't allow rape to redefine how the judicial system operates. Innocent until proven guilty, even if that means some guilty people walking free.\n\nGive ever<b> y woma</b>n a gun. Rape numbers would plummet.",

The law has always been that people who owned property either house or land could vote, meaning wealthy women could vote a long time before poor/working class men ever could. I'll grant it was far less <b> common </b>for women to own property, usually wealthy women were just married to men with the property, but in the cases where women did own property they could vote and poor men could not. Women have been going to university for more than a century, e.g. elizabeth blackwell being the first female doctor nearly 200 years ago. Divorce was nigh impossible for anyone 100 years, in fact in countries like canada you actually had to get a law from parliament to be granted a divorce, something that virtually no man or<b>  woman</b> could ever obtain. Seriously research some history yourself instead of just spouting the same innacurate garbage everyone has heard a billion times before.",

Allen as she attempted to get her foot in the door at any medical school in Philadelphia.[1] She was met with resistance almost everywhere. Most physicians recommended that she either go to Paris to study or that she take up a disguise as a man to study medicine. The main reasons offered for her rejection were that (1) she was a<b>  woman</b> and therefore intellectually inferior, and (2) she might actually prove equal to the task, prove to be competition, and that she could not expect them to \"furnish [her] with a stick to break our heads with\". Out of desperation, she applied to twelve \"country schools\".[2]\n\nMedical education in the United States[edit]\n\nPortrait of Elizabeth Blackwell by Joseph Stanley Kozlowski, 1905. Syracuse University Medical School collection.\nIn October, 1847, Blackwell was accepted as a medical student by Hobart College, then called Geneva Medical College, located in upstate New York. Her acceptance was a near-accident. The dean and faculty, usually responsible for evaluating an applicant for matriculation, were not able to make a decision due to the special nature of Blackwell's case. They put the issue up to a vote by the 150 male students of the class with the stipulation that if one student objected, Blackwell would be turned away. The young men voted unanimously to accept her.[6][7]  SO BASED ON THIS SHE WAS ONLY EXCEPTED BECAUSE THOSE MEN WERE NOT A BUNCH OF DOUCHE BAGS!!! LUCKY FOR HER I WOULD SAY! But you do not live in reality if you think a women on her own merits was able to do anything that a man was allowed to do you would be wrong. it has been and is a mans world and that WILL be changing. Believe that! And all you men who want to deny the truth of the past and what the problems that still exist today are going to be in a world of hurt when the tied begins to change, in this country and around the world. I suggest you get on board.",

The thing that is wrong with that however is that is that it still shows priority towards women and paints them as the victims. He only cares about women. He said himself that he is not egalitarian. He obviously sees the <b> patriarchy </b>as a problem still and thinks that feminism is still relevant in the US today. That is the \"problem\" people are having with him. Just because we agree with him on the topic of alimony that doesn't mean we can't look at his way of thinking for what it really is. \n\nI personally knew what he meant for him saying that but I noticed that he didn't bring up anything about men's issues aside from agreeing with Joe on some things. (From this clip alone, maybe if I saw the whole thing...) What I will say is that his way of opeating is probably a way more affective way on bringing change to the feminist movement than most stuff. Maybe he is an undercover agent for men's rights and can't say anything to lose his favor amongst non rabid feminists lol.",

This part of the grand scheme for the purpose of population control as well as create a distraction from real issues as through this mechanism we are so preoccupied with bullshit that we do not have the time to think about the system that fucks us everyday. Just look at how many mechanisms we have that can be directly linked to the concept to slow down population...economic manipulation = population control , laws where now any type of unwanted advances can be deemed \"rape\"... new policies emerging to encourage diversification of work culture by encouraging companies to hire 40 to 50% more women..this system now ignores best person for the job and focuses on the <b> gender,</b> which is a battle men will lose...for those who are working, men will dig their heads into work, isolating themselves from interacting with female counterparts out of fear that they can lose their job as a result of<b>  sexual</b> harassment..this will eliminate romantic relationships at work..and since we spend more time at work than outside of it this will hinder those natural interactions. Socio-engineering is very important to meet this new quota. Dont get me started on Monsanto, now BAYER. Absolutelly EVERYTHING can be linked to population control and this has been a concern to the global elites since 1900s. This is simply fact and is necessary.",

My point of view is that if you are good father to your kids and want to be involved in your kids life and you haven't committed any crime, you should be allowed access to your children after a divorce no questions asked. I also feel that if you have joint custody and you are already providing for your kids and contributing to their school clothes and feeding them out of your pocket you shouldn't be obligated to pay child support to the mother. It's <b> weird </b>because every households situation is different and when divorce happens and lawyers get involved it gets messy especially when there's animosity. But any mother worth her salt should never let her own anger towards her ex get in the way of her children having their father in their life.

I live in NZ not USA and parents are not denied access to their children here unless they are a danger to them or unfit to care for them. If there are drug problems the parents must be in recovery and be drug tested to have custody. Its not about <b> gender.</b> I agree kids should have time with both parents. I think in the past judges have leaned toward mothers having custody as up until the divorce they've been the primary caregivers and the judges feel its less upheaval for the children to continue to be with that parent. I believe custody and child support shouldn't be based on the<b>  gender</b> of the parent. All I would suggest to any parent of eithe<b> r gende</b>r denied access or over-charged support is to appeal with a better lawyer and get some support from a psychologist or accountant etc. I'm sorry if you don't get to see your children :(",

I get the points where you talked about alimony and even the lack of due process in college <b> sexual </b>assault allegations as actual sexist offenses against both genders. I had never thought about these things and agree with you both. Where I take issue is at the point where he begins to callously make claims that the judicial system is doing women a disservice by investigating any<b>  sexual</b> assault claim against a man. There is a difference between women and men, as you have acknowledged both in your routines and on the pod, women are physically less capable than men to protect themselves in the majority of cases. Sometimes, it is that simple. Forgive me if I, myself, begin to sound patriarchal but women do deserve the benefit of the doubt in an instance of physical violence; especially when your guest himself admits the administration and judiciary staff are predominantly male and many of us I am sure have witnessed it fail women. What he is saying is not \"controversy\" but is truly, TRULY disrespectful towards women and men who are actual victims o<b> f sexua</b>l assault whom have not been fairly served by the powers that be. The comments I see on this board right now are kind of repulsive and I'm beginning to think that cretins begin to show their colors when an \"intellectual\" or as I prefer, \"complete dipshit\" happens to sing the tune of their unfortunate beliefs. Nonetheless, I'm a fan and hope that you keep throwing a wrench in the works from time to time and frustrating/exciting people. Keep up the good work.",

In the pursuit for the eternally elusive equality...family and the <b> common </b>decency between men and women has been sacrificed.  Feminists get women angry and mistrustful of men and tells them they are entitled to be a bitch and walk around like a slut without being ashamed and abandon their obligations to their families and expect to be honoured and respected for just being a<b>  woman</b>.  Meanwhile, feminist organizations discriminate heavily against men and are a haven for man hating abusive lesbians.  Feminists oppose equality when it comes to shared parenting post divorce.  Feminists are arrogant and self serving and act like spoiled children.  No one is saying women should be shackled and owned  by abusive men...but guess what?  Abusive men in power do not spare men and boys any abuse either.  In lands where women are treated like property and enslaved (like Sunni Muslim lands) the men are also murdered and enslaved.  Little orphaned boys are raped and kept like property too...feminism seems to not be aware of or care about this at all except to point out that men are rapists.  Where is feminism when it comes to acknowledging that awful women exist and are among its ranks and use feminist narrative that women are always victims of oppression as an excuse for crimes committed by women?  Like many kids have had to grow up under the thumb of abusive and manipulative mothers and feminism always blames the absent father..yet feminism doesn't acknowledge that the kids are often left alone with abusive mothers because the feminist loving courts often discriminate against the fathers.\nFuck feminism..it is sexist and responsible for a lot of suffering.  The only equality any of us have comes at the Cross where God will judge.  Before God we are all equal but on earth we are all different.",

Yet women don't have to sign up for and feminists bitched about when the gov was going to implement it. \n\nHow about divorce laws that are without a doubt sexist such as alimony. Ironically now that women are having to pay it now feminists want to change the laws. Where we the feminists for the past 50 years? \n\nIt's not about equality.",

Taking time and making sure that both are being sincere loving people.. if things go wrong you will be able to figure it out. If you choose the right person who loves you and if you are sincere and open you will find solutions even when the romantic love is gone and you decide to split up. If a man considers himself a good and sensible person he should wonder why he ended up with such a strange person as a wife. It's not about <b> gender.</b>. there are always bad people.. just make sure you don't end up marrying a bad person.

I was confused about being called disrespectful when I politely questioned what I was being taught in school, but everyone else seemed to beilve things with litte or no investigation. When at 14 I started to be de-sexualized by certain elements of the media. When at 15 Men started dropping out of colleges because they didn't want to appear masculine. When at 18 my female friends/and family demonized me every-time I expressed my feelings. I decided that I was a Meninist and this seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that Meninism has become an unpopular word.\nMen are choosing not to identify as Meninist. Apparently I am among the ranks of Men who's expressions are seen as to strong, to aggressive, isolating, and anti-female- yet strangely attractive.\nWhy has the word become such an uncomfortable one.\nI am from Britan!\nAnd I think it is right, that i am paid what I earned.\nI think it is right, that I should be able to make decisions about my own body.\n(applase)\nI think it is right the Men be involved on my behalf in the policy and decisions that will effect my life. \nI think it is right, that socially I am afforded the same respect as whamen.\nBut sadlly, I can say that thier is no one county in the west where all men can except to receive these rights.\nNO country in the west can yet say that they have achieve<b> d gende</b>r equality. \nThese rights I consider to be human rights; But I am one of the luck ones.\nMy life is a sheer privilege. Because my parents didn't love me less because I was born an son.\nMy school did not medicate me because I was a boy. ( they tried )\nMy mentoers didn't assume i would go less far because i would have to pay alimony one day.\n\nThese influences for t<b> he gend</b>er equality ambasadors, that make me who i am today.\nThey may not know it. But they are the inadvertent Meninist that are changing, the world today. \nWe need more of those.\nAnd if you still hate the word.\nIt is not the word that is important.\nIt is the idea and the ambition behind it.\nBecause not all Men have received the same right that i have.\nIf fact statistically very few have been.\nIn 1997 Hillary Clinton made a famous speech in berlin about Mens rights.\nSadly many of the things that she wanted to change are still true today. \nBut what stood out for me the most was that less then 2% were female.\nHow can we affect change in the world when only half of it is invited,\nOr feel welcome to participate- in this conversation?\n\nWomen I would like to take this opportunity, to extend your formal invitation.\n(appla<b> se)\nGen</b>der equality is your issue to.\nBecause to date, I see my fathers role of a parent as being valued less by society.\ndespite me needing his presence by my side as much as my mothers.\nIve seen Men destroyed by the very people they sought for help. \nEven when their feedback was requested. \nLiving in fear that their masculinity would be \nviewed as toxic. In Fact in the UK suicide is the biggest killer of Men.",

Stupid and useless people will always outnumber the intelligent and productive. So if you give EVERYONE equal power in a meritocracy, the first thing that the <b> dumb </b>will do is seek to tear down the Meritocracy. Because in a world where the spoils go to the ones that worked for it, they lose. \n\nJust look at the United States annual budget. I think it's something like 58% of all tax dollars go to Welfare spending and something like 96% of welfare spending is spent on single mothers who've literally never accomplished anything in their lives except for having working reproductive organs.",
