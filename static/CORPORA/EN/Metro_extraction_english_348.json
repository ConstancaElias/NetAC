        "postText": "The Muslim Council of Britain says it has \u2018lost faith\u2019 in the ability of politicians to tackle racism, after new cases of Islamophobia in the Conservative Party emerged.', 'The BBC reported that 20 new cases had been highlighted to the party, which involved party members sharing or supporting anti-Muslim posts on social media.', 'It comes as Sajjad Karim, a Conservative party MEP, revealed that he had received Islamophobic abuse himself, including from \u2018very senior members of the Conservative Party, one of whom is in fact a serving minister at this moment in time.\u2019', 'In some of the latest cases handed over to the party, individuals posted comments such as \u2018Muslim scum\u2019 and \u2018I don\u2019t want Muslims in this country\u2019.', 'Miqdaad Versi of the Muslim Council of Britain, told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Not only have you got Islamophobia in the lower levels of the party amongst members, but this goes right to the top.', '\u2018You\u2019ve got a Muslim Conservative MEP, Sajjad Karim saying there\u2019s an issue of Islamophobia, including where he\u2019s been personally targeted.\u2019', 'Mr Versi said it was a \u2018very serious\u2019 problem for the Conservative Party, that a \u2018serving minister has been accused of making Islamophobic comments.\u2019', 'He also renewed his calls for an independent inquiry, but said given the lack of action and the fact that Boris Johnson had \u2018rowed back\u2019 on the commitment of an independent inquiry, he had lost faith in the politicians to \u2018tackle racism\u2019.', 'Having initially committed to an \u2018inquiry into Islamophobia\u2019 during a TV debate, the prime minister downgraded it to \u2018a general investigation\u2019 into all types of prejudice.', 'Mr Versi went on to say that it was a shame it had to come down to external pressure in order to get the party to commit to an independent inquiry, which the Conservative Party has thus far failed to be \u2018transparent\u2019 on.', 'It comes after a senior Muslim councillor in the Conservative Party said he had \u2018revaluated his view of Islamophobia in the party\u2019.', 'The Wakefield Express reported Councillor Nadeem Ahmed felt an independent inquiry was necessary after \u2018speaking to victims of Islamophobia\u2019 and seeing the volume of racist comments that had been posted online.', 'Harun Khan, Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: \u2018We are not surprised by the latest revelations.', '\u2018They are a manifestation of institutional Islamophobia within the Conservative Party, and corroborate the polling done demonstrating the scale of the issue.', '\u2018An independent and specific inquiry into Islamophobia specifically is long overdue.', 'Sadly, the Conservative response has been woeful. From denial, through to now a reluctant commitment to a broad and watered down investigation that we fear will do nothing to address this problem.\u2019",
