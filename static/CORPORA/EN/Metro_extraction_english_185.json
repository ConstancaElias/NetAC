        "postText": "A police officer who hurled horrendous racist abuse at takeaway staff in a drunken attack has asked to have her job back.', 'Former copper Katie Barratt has launched an appeal to re-join the police after she was sacked for using racial slurs against Asian employees while on a Northumbria Police staff night out.', 'Barratt was said to be drunk and waiting for her food to be prepared at the Spice of Punjab takeaway in Newcastle upon Tyne in December 2017.', 'The officer, in her 20s, was sacked from the force after a meeting heard that she said: \u2018I wish these f*****g P***s would hurry up with my pizza\u2019, while also calling them \u2018n*****s\u2019.', 'Barratt \u2013 whose comments were not heard by staff \u2013 was instantly dismissed for gross misconduct, despite over 20 character references to save her job.', 'Now the former officer \u2013 whose life-long dream was to join the police force \u2013 has appealed the misconduct panel\u2019s decision.', 'The grounds of her appeal are not yet known.', 'Despite the abusive outburst, Barratt previously claimed \u2018there\u2019s no deep, meaningful racism in me\u2019.', 'At a misconduct hearing in June, her solicitor Guy Ladenburg called it an \u2018isolated event\u2019 which was \u2018quite out of character\u2019.', 'On the night in question, Barratt was described by two colleagues as being so drunk she couldn\u2019t walk properly, when they headed into the empty takeaway at 10.30pm.', 'Barratt claimed she wasn\u2019t a racist and that what subsequently unfolded was \u2018not a true reflection of who I am at all.\u2019', 'She added: \u2018I\u2019m really sorry for what I\u2019ve done. I can\u2019t emphasise how sorry I am.', '\u2018It\u2019s my dream job. It\u2019s all I wanted to do since I was little.', '\u2018I know the effects racial abuse have on the community. I\u2019m absolutely devastated that I have had that effect on the community.', '\u2018In the last six months I have had time to reflect on my actions and I will never ever repeat again what happened that night.\u2019', 'She continued: \u2018I have matured a lot. I don\u2019t go out anymore, I don\u2019t drink. I\u2018m pleading with you to please give me another chance.\u2019', 'Her appeal is set to be heard at the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner in Benton Lane.",
