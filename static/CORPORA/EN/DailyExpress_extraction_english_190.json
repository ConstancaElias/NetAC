        "postText": "'During a live television election clash, the hard-Left Labour leader insisted he would remain neutral in the Brexit debate should he become prime minister.', 'He also signalled that a Labour government under his leadership could also allow a fresh referendum on Scottish independence within three years of taking power.', 'His sudden policy shifts came during a hostile onslaught from members of the studio audience during last night\u2019s BBC1 Question Time debate between the leaders of the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems and SNP.', 'One questioner called his reckless socialist ideas frightening while another tore into misoginy and anti-Semitism in Labour ranks.', 'The two-hour programme, filmed in Sheffield, often descended into angry and acrimonious exchanges as audiences subjected all four leaders to a series of hostile questions.', 'Boris Johnson savaged Mr Corbyn over his confession that he would remain neutral in a second EU referendum campaign.', 'Mr Corbyn\u2019s position seems to have mutated tonight. He is now going to neutral on a deal he is going to do, the Prime Minister said.', 'It don\u2019t think it is sensible for this great country of ours to spend the next year on yet more delectable disputations about the EU and have another referendum on Scottish independence.', 'Mr Johnson told the 150-strong audience: The other three party leaders want to block Brexit or, absurdly, want to have a second referendum.', 'Asked how important it was for someone in his position to always tell the truth, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: I think it is absolutely vital. ', ' And I think that the issue of trust in politics is central to this election. ', ' And fundamental to the corrosion of trust in politics at the moment is the failure of politicians to deliver Brexit. ', ' During his half hour in front of the audience, Mr Corbyn, a hardline Left - wing Eurosceptic before becoming Labour leader, faced laughter and groans over his equivocal EU stance. ', ' Daniel Holt, a member of the audience, asked him: Will you campaign to Leave or Remain in the EU ? Why would anyone vote Labour without getting the answer to that question ? ', 'Mr Corbyn insisted he had tried to bring people together and claimed he could negotiate a credible deal with the EU.', ' Bristling laughter from the audience, the Labour leader said: I 'm trying to answer the gentleman's question. ', ' He added: My role and the role of our government will be to ensure that that referendum is held in a fair atmosphere and we will abide by the result of it.', ' And I will adopt, as prime minister, if I am at the time, a neutral stance so that I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring communities and country together rather than continuing an endless debate about the EU and Brexit. ', ' Presenter Fiona Bruce pressed him: Just to confirm, you will stay neutral in a second referendum ? ', ' Nodding, Mr Corbyn replied : First heard here on Question Time!', ' Questioned about his stance on Scottish independence, the Labour leader claimed he would not allow a referendum on the issue in the early years of a Labour government. ', ' Pressed by Ms Bruce about what that meant, he said: Not within the first two years, at least. ', ' In the opening exchanges, the Labour leader appeared shocked on facing a string of attacks from audience members. ', ' His first questioner, Ian Parkin, asked if businesses be frightened of an incoming Labour government.', 'Another questioner asked: To be honest Mr Corbyn, I don\u2019 t think it\u2019 s businesses that should be scared, I think it\u2019 s everyone.', 'Your reckless socialist ideas are genuinely terrifying to me, my family and my friends and I think freedom will completely erode if they let you have the keys to Number 10. ', 'A bruised Mr Corbyn replied: I can\u2019 t understand everything that is going on your mind that you makes you say that.Maybe we can talk about it later. ', 'Mr Corbyn also faced an angry onslaught from an audience member over misogyny and anti - Semitism in Labour ranks.The questioner raised the issue of the Jewish Labour MP Ruth Smeeth, who was heckled after speaking out about abuse she suffered.', ' The audience member said: I look at a video of Ruth Smeeth online where she was in a press conference with you and Ruth Smeeth, a Jewish MP, was heckled out of that press conference...and there you are at the end of the press conference chatting happily to that same heckler.I don 't buy this nice old grandpa, I see that video and that tells me all I need to know.', 'Responding, Mr Corbyn said: Nobody should suffer any abuse in public life or privately, adding: Many women Labour MPs, Ruth Smeeth included and others have suffered the most unbelievable levels of abuse.', 'And it was a Labour MP Jo Cox who was murdered because she stood up in public life. I simply say to you that bad behaviour, misogynism, racism in any form is absolutely not acceptable in any form whatsoever in my party or in society.', 'Mr Corbyn was given a clear offer of possible support in a hung parliament from SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon during the show.', 'She said her party may hold the balance of power if there is a hung parliament and she would use that influence to make her demands for a second independence referendum.', 'The Scottish First Minister said she would expect Mr Corbyn to respect the right of the Scottish people to choose their own future.', 'She told the Question Time audience the two parties both wanted to make health and welfare reforms.', 'Ms Sturgeon said she did not believe the Labour leader would walk away from the chance to hold power to push through reforms simply because he wants for a couple of years on the timescale for a rerun independence poll.', 'Jeremy Corbyn supports the right to self-determination for almost every other country in the world. I\u2019m not sure he is going to compromise the chance to have a Labour government for that issue, she said.', 'I lead a minority government in Scotland so I know the compromises that you have to make to govern in that situation.', 'Ms Sturgeon said that while she backed a so-called confirmatory referendum on Brexit, she did not support holding one on a Scottish exit deal if the country voted for independence.', 'The SNP leader said she expected to strike a less formal agreement with Mr Corbyn than a full coalition agreement.', 'Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson faced angry attacks over her party\u2019s pledge to revoke the EU\u2019s Article 50 departure process to cancel Brexit.', 'Ms Swinson said: We are being very straightforward as a party that we want to stop Brexit.', 'You might agree with us, you might disagree with us.', 'I don't think you can accuse us of not being upfront about wanting to stop Brexit.', 'We 've been crystal clear about that from the very beginning.','Not for one second do I think that means that you or anybody like you is stupid. I think it means we disagree.', 'One angry audience member, referring to the result of the 2016 EU referendum, told her: You can disagree with me, but you lost.', 'The questioner said the policy was undemocratic from somebody who wished the last three-and-a-half years had never happened.', 'Critics last night raised questions about the makeup of the audience after several questioners appeared to be party activists asking scripted questions.', 'Robbie Gibb, former communications chief to Theresa May and a ex-BBC executive, said: This audience feels like it\u2019s full political activists rather than typical voters.', 'Following the programme, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: How can you be a leader if you are neutral on the biggest issue of our time?', 'Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: Corbyn proved all he has to offer is more dither and delay on Brexit.', 'He can\u2019t get Brexit done if he doesn\u2019t even know what he thinks about Brexit. And without a plan to get Brexit done he has no credibility on anything else.', 'If he becomes Prime Minister politicians will just go on arguing while other important issues get ignored.'",

It is clear that your referendum was flawed.It only asked you leave or remain.it did not ask you how you wanted to leave WA or no WA, nor what kind of future trade relationship you wanted with the EU afterwards Cuba, Canada, Turkey, Norway style.Those decisions were left to your parliament. However, immediately after triggering article 50, May organised a GE and lost her majority.No single party won a majority, so you had a <b> lame </b>duck government and a parliament in which none of the above options had a majority. And that 's why on 12 December you have another general election, where hopefully a party will win a majority so that it can push through its own choice of one of the above options.",

You did not have a Remain parliament had there been a  majority in parliament to remain, they would have revoked article 50, which is the only way to remain.  What you had, was a parliament that could not agree on how to Brexit - with or without a withdrawal agreement - with a Cuba, Canada, Norway or Turkey style trade deal afterwards. This is why you have another GE: to try to get a majority for one of the parties so that it can push through its preferred way to Brexit. ",

He has stuck rigidly to that stance, whilst EVERY other party has jumped about like frogs on a hot stove, trying to get voters on their side. Your heroic Magic Grandpa, is simply playing the field for votes. But his dither and fence sitting is biting him in the rear. It's clear many have now jumped onto the Boris wagon, because he offers a conclusion to this Brexit fiasco, that will not risk decimating the UK into chaos.",
