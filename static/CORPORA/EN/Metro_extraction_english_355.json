        "postText": "A shocking video shows a man mocking Muslims by \u2018praying to Aladdin\u2019 while rocking back and forth on a prayer mat and imitating Arabic.', 'The footage, shared on Facebook, shows the man in what appears to be an Islamic prayer room, as he ridicules the religion as his friend films it laughing.', 'It was uploaded onto social media last week by Terence Howarth \u2013 who is believed to appear in the video.', 'In the video he wears a topi \u2013 a cap worn by Muslims as a sign of respect \u2013 and kept his shoes on throughout in another sign of disrespect.', 'Posters can be seen in the background in the room saying: \u2018Friday Prayer.\u2019', 'Encouraged by his friend, the man kneels on the mat and pretends to speak Arabic as he calls for the Disney character to \u2018fly me away\u2019.', 'It is not known exactly where the incident was filmed but it is understood to have happened in Bolton, Greater Manchester.', 'Greater Manchester Police said it had launched an investigation into a \u2018hate incident after being made aware of videos circulating online\u2019.', 'The footage shows the man wearing a jacket and trainers energetically bowing on the mat in front of a \u2018holy book\u2019.', 'Slapping the book, he says: \u2018Hum yah, ooh ah, boo bah. Aladdin, take me away.\u2019', 'The topi falls off his head as he rocks back and forth, flailing his arms in the air.', 'He bursts out laughing and his friend filming the scene says: \u2018Take it again.\u2019', 'A second clip shows him with the cap back on, kneeling on the mat as he chants: \u2018Aladdin, fly me away. Aladdin, fly me away.\u2019', 'Looking up at the ceiling he says: \u2018May Jesus be with you now leave me alone as I fly on my magic carpet.', '\u2018[Where] are you Aladdin come and rub my lamp.\u2019', 'He then sticks out his tongue to the camera and walks off.', 'Many have taken to social media to call the videos \u2018racist\u2019 and said his actions were a \u2018hate crime\u2019.', 'One wrote: \u2018This needs to be shared with his employer and he needs to be fired. Or this needs to be shared for awareness and the video taken down for offensive material.', '\u2018You cannot mock someone else\u2019s religion for fun and laughter in the UK when there are equality laws. This can be considered as a hate crime.\u2019', 'Another said: \u2018It\u2019s out of order and I think it\u2019s wrong people find this funny.\u2019', 'One user said the video was racist, to which Howarth replied: \u2018What\u2019s racist about that? I think you will find religion is not a race so get your facts right.\u2019', 'Chief Inspector John Charlton of GMP said: \u2018Those who think they can hide behind a keyboard and disseminate this kind of harmful material should expect to be investigated.', '\u2018Any type of hate crime will not be tolerated in Greater Manchester and we encourage anyone who has been a victim of or witnessed a hate crime to report it immediately.\u2019",

To me with my atheist rational mind there really is no difference between him and mainstream praying and it is a strong element in my belief system that you should be free to express sometimes controversial views.
