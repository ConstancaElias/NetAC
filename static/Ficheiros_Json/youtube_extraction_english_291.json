If they were all friends and got along then why did some side with the french vs spain?   And if they were all great friends like in a disney film?   Why have different tribes?   Alot of pre white culture is always left out when talking about americas.   Cannibalism,  kinda comes to mind?   Of these fine peaceful people.

Surveys have shown that a majority of Native Americans say they are unaffected by these team names. America is a great country but as with any and every country in existence there is a dark history. Let's not pretend a baseball or football team name represents that history. These symbols are symbols of strength and toughness. You have the Notre Dame fighting Irish, Boston Celtics, and there's even a small college team name of the \"Saxons\". These all represent caucasians. It's not a big deal. Have a good day!",

(The only time some of those are brought up is by a racist with zero intent of having an open dialogue. Their only aim is to be hurtful). I understand these kids have probably heard worse before but it's cruel to put them into a position of being victimized for a video. They shouldn't have to deal with it especially one right after the other like that. There is a better way to get this information across without being harmful to these kids. Teen Vogue needs to do a better job protecting them.",

Some tribes offer to pay for college because they can, and of course you have to meet requirements. Plus, they are a bit red due to classifications back in the day; however, today that's changing because of the differences between the south western and northern tribes color differences in majority. They don't live in teepees, usually they are used for prayer sessions or to have them up for special occasions. The  Navajo have hoogans instead of a teepee. Head dresses are used or may not be used in different ways in each tribe, or be very similar to one another. Another fun fact they should mention is the assumption of being Mexican or Hawaiian in public because of the similarities they share. Overall, this video is alright in pointing out the obvious, but it was a bit forced.",

The Inuit people of Canada, the Mixtec of Mexico, the Quecha of the South American Andes, The Yaghan of the Southern tip of the Americas, The Amazonians of Brazil and the Taino/Arowak people of the Caribbean all should have the right to be called Native Americans. Most \"Latinos\" deny or don't know their native heritage, its what gives us color in our skin! Its sad and shouldn't be this way, with a common event of colonialism in our roots we should all be proud of who we are now and who we where as a people before now in the Americas and in the world.",

Even before the Spanish had landed in Aztec lands, the Aztec themselves had subjugated enslaved and conquered all surrounding tribes. The Aztec were not European. They definitely were not Christian or Muslim. You're logic is biased bigoted and flawed. Don't feign intelligence when you clearly have no understanding of anything other than single minded opinions. To finish my thought though, the Aztec were mesoamerican imperialists, who worshipped their pagan gods and the sun. They fit none of your previous \"requirements\" and check all boxes. Notice that you never once mentioned India or Hinduism or Buddhism.",

Obviously you're on a couple different videos with your victim mentality about ancient dead tribes. Well I'll be here to tell you that nature is as nature does. And it's human nature to take territory. Every single race of people have done it so it's not about race. It's just the way it is. One day our great American culture will be conquered too. The difference is that if it happens in our lifetime, I will join the new culture or die with a gun in my hand if they want to slaughter us.

The reality is the British and French had genocidal intentions when they came across with the natives, since they considered them as non human and too weak and small in height to serve as useful slaves. The spanish and portuguese on the other hand never intended to commit a genocide against the natives. Although treatment towards the natives was very cruel during the first years of Spanish colonialism in the Carribbean, the spanish crown at that time was extremely religious and started sending jesuits since it was a priority for them to convert natives to catholicisim, it was the jesuits that were sent that started advocating for equal rights for the natives and iberians since they realised natives also could believe in god so they should be considered equal in rights. Since the genocide of native americans in the rest of North America happened so long ago there is little records of it, however in California, before it's annexation by the US was populated by over half a million natives that were all killed by US militias in the 1850s. Also the role infectous diseases played in wiping out the natives in North America is often exagerated to cover up the voluntary genocide the British, French and the US commited.",

We do get some things. As children in schools we get $10 each semester for book fairs. In the part of where I live in Oklahoma, we have a Indian hospital where they do look primarily for people of Indian heritage BUT they do hire people of other ethnicities too!! My dad (indian) works there, and so does my mom (not indian) so it is common for others to work there! In schools, growing up, we also got a free dentist care. I believe it was just a check up and enamel sealant, it wasn't much and only happened once a year in the school. A majority of the people I've grown up with in Oklahoma have Indian heritage and as long as they have their Indian card they are available to receive these benefits.",

First off genetically natives are very similar to ancient europeans and share approx 1/3 european blood before the europeans you speak of even made contact. Second off whites thought blacks were ugly and natives were sexy. When the spanish came to mexico half of them were about the same colour anyway. Acting like the natives werent just as brutal as whites. Mexicans may be a spanish native mixture but are even more rasict to blacks then whites. Natives think they are black when they are an ancient european / asian mixture hence large noses. Negroids or mongoloids cannont genetically have large noses. Natives are scientifically a Caucasioid/mongoloid admixture",

The native Americans in my area actually don't have to pay taxes and they are making a lot of money off the casino with the percap checks. they do get free healthcare and they don't have to pay for school. But that's individually. It's just what the tribe has chosen to spend their money on. I know this all for a fact because my son is Native American. But I fully think that it is deserved and the tribe works hard to take care of each other and if they want to spend their money to help their members out they are allowed to do so. I'm thankful that the tribe that my son is a part of cares so much about each others well being.",

Even my own culture I go to other countries and they think all white Americans are rich and that all Americans all they eat is McDonald's.  they think none of them can speak the language of that country. People think that all Mexicans eat nothing but rice and beans... but just because they are stereotypes doesn't mean that we should stop traditions. Just because people of Georgia or Alabama have a southern twang does that mean that they all should go to Accent elimination. It's okay to have stereotypes I say. Because that's what makes us different from one another as long as we accept each other's differences and not be over sensitive and mean to each other. I like people who show off their culture and traditions and I'll proud of themselves but not mean towards people who are not of their own race.",

I'm sure that many of the native Americans would offer up tributes of people who were raised to be sacrificed by the aztecs.  there are rumors that the aztecs had huts made of skeleton and human tissue to live in, they had shaped heads and sharp teeth. the whole area of the aztec nation smelled of rotting corpses, all the way up to Oregon.",

If you had to stick with only one kind then you will have a hard time finding someone and it would probably take you a long time to find someone considering that we have many different cultures and races in our world.",

The second is just my theory , haha.  But, you got colors like black, white, brown, yellow, why not red right?üòÜ And I don't think it's racist, racism is how you negatively perceive a certain ethnicity or make fun of how they look. I, for example  could be considered a yellow-brown skinüòä",

    "commentText": "most non native americans werent taught the truth in american history because text books were controlled by companies that are conservative and biased. also most non american indians do not understand tribal histories, laws, treaties. treaties are the one thing that are continually ignored by the us congress, especially with the current presidential adminstration and the department of the interior and the bureau of indian affairs. we need more american indians in top positions in government to oversee the laws governing tribes and prevent mismanagement, return treaty laws to current review and legislation, reopen the treaties and allow due process to the eventual returns of lands stolen by the us government from the treaty violations. paha sapa is a region in western south dakota that has been taken illegally and needs to be returned. the cash valuecis over one million dollars and is held in a trust fund. land is more important than the million dollars. the money is basically a cash settlement for the forfeiture of the paha sapa. after the 1876 battle of the little bighorn did the government truly took the paha sapa as a punishment and violation of the 1868 treaty. the us lost in 1876 and to show its punishment the us government allowed settlement and gold mining and passage by totally violating the fort laramie treaty. the united nations have sent messages to us congress that treaty violation is a violation of the native american indians right to sovereignty and their rightful ownership of that land which is sacred and spiritual territory.",

    "commentText": "there are various groups according to the geographic location. the plains, plateau and basin, northeast woodlands, southeast, southwest, northwest coast, california, arctic. dwellings used are varied. many native american indians live in western style homes and some have replica dwellings of the traditional home alongside. there are over 500 languages spoken but many are endangered. native american indians dont always hunt, when they do, it isnt for sport. discrimination is real, especially in many western states such as montana, the dakotas, nebraska, wyoming, nevada, arizona, new mexico, idaho. of course discrimination is in the eastern states. in states where there are reservations, there tends to be hostility towards native american indians due to lies and misconceptions promoted by the media and some educational institutions. the us government has a unique relationship with american indians but it hasnt been a positive one unfortunately due to the breaking of treaties and outright land thievery and denial of human rights, termination policies, pollution and environmental distruction. survival is only way by being outspoken about the mistreatment from over 500 years of colonization and oppression.",

Well, I aim to put the pan flute there. \nAnyways, i noticed the headdress was made in Indonesia anyways which kinda annoyed me.. It then made me realise üòÇ \nBut I really have always wished I was Native American! The history is awesome and I'd be proud. Rather then being some pale, blonde, British... literally so boring! I was hoping so much to be even 1% Native American in my DNA test  because I believe it doesn't matter if you're 95% whatever and only 5% something else it still makes you equally that nationality because it's still in our blood, it's still the sa,e history and traditions our ancestors lived. Equally our ancestors from our 95% blood that's just more recent. But no.... Just Italy, England and Ireland and stuff. I'M SO JEALOUS!",

They are genetically linked to Asians (certain physical attributes making that clear) therefore they are NOT any rightful heirs to anything. They were here before white Europeans, true. But the mere fact that their roots are prehistorically Asiatic suggests to me that they themselves were merauders who traversed the world , came upon this continent and more than likely uprooted the former inhabitants of this land...The same way we did much later. This \"Noble Savage\" myth is laughably untrue. They were just as capable of violence and cruelty as anyone else. White men are simply more evolved, culturally and biologically so our cruelty is more efficient.",

The oldest Americans the Paleoindian population looked like Africans Melanesians South Indians Negritos and Australians. \n\n\nhttp://www.pnas.org/content/102/51/18309\n\nComparative morphological studies of the earliest human skeletons of the New World have shown that, whereas late prehistoric, recent, and present Native Americans tend to exhibit a cranial morphology similar to late and modern Northern Asians (short and wide neurocrania; high, orthognatic and broad faces; and relatively high and narrow orbits and noses), the earliest South Americans tend to be more similar to present Australians, Melanesians, and Sub-Saharan Africans (narrow and long neurocrania; prognatic, low faces; and relatively low and broad orbits and noses). However, most of the previous studies of early American human remains were based on small cranial samples. Herein we compare the largest sample of early American skulls ever studied (81 skulls of the Lagoa Santa region) with worldwide data sets representing global morphological variation in humans, through three different multivariate analyses. The results obtained from all multivariate analyses confirm a close morphological affinity between SouthAmerican Paleoindians and extant Australo-Melanesians groups, supporting the hypothesis that two distinct biological populations could have colonized the New World in the Pleistocene/Holocene transition.",

The term Redskin, (my own personal hypothesis) during the time when British first landed & tried to claim the land as their own, the natives spent most their time outside. White ppl get sunburn. But we have melanin so we get red, but tan. And that's what I think. Upon UK 1st arrival, & seeing natives for the 1st time, they never saw anyone with soon different from theirs. So they called it Redskin. I could be totally 100% wrong, I probably am, about skin color, Not wrong about school grants & govt asst. But itsounds about right to me where the term Redskin came from.",

The other races are represented my whole body, while whites are a single hand. Guess who sold off the first slaves to the Europeans. Blacks. Everyone here is ignorant. Hey TeenVogue wanna be unbiased and stop brainwashing us teens? Do you know what else we haven't been taught. Blacks sold off their people to the Europeans.

    "commentText": "I'm so confused by this, my husband is native, my son is native, both status, & both absolutely get free health care through the band, in fact my husband just got his entire mouth done and fixed including two root canals....free. He also does absolutely have the option of going to post secondary paid by his band....yes, he has to have the same academic requirements as everyone else in order to go to post secondary but so long as you have the grades, his band will pay for post secondary. His band also offers band housing (often just $400 a month on average) for a brand new home built by the band for your family, all you have to do is put your name on the list and wait for your turn to come around and boom...the band will build you and your family a brand new home here on the reservation where we currently rent, sometimes you can be on that list for a couple of years so if we wanted a house faster, we just have to come up with 10 grand and the band will build us a home of our own brand new. There are LOTS of financial benefits, perhaps every band is just different. And I actually had a conversation about headdresses with one of my husbands uncles, I asked him is it true that only natives can put on a headdress, because it needs to be earned‚Äù and he just laughed and said ‚Äúpoint to a single native in this day in age, that has earned the right to put on a headdress  according to old values and traditions, you won't find many‚Äù just thought that was an interesting response, Anyways, clearly every band is very different, but to say these benefits are just wildly fabricated rumors across the board just simply isn't true. Oh and we also DO get tax free, we get tax free on anything on ANY band land, even if it's not YOUR band land, so long as your status, & where I live that includes high end shops like Sephora even, the source, marks, name brand stores, tax free gas, tax free tobacco, tax free groceries, tax free makeup, tax free clothes. The tax never seems like much but it adds up. His band also sends out bonus $250 every Christmas to each band member, plus a voucher for a turkey lol. he also gets all of his work gear paid for, shoes, tools, anything he needs for work, I literally could go on forever......",

I've never heard anyone even mention 5 of them, and the \"red skin\" thing only in a history lesson of \"They used to be referred to as redskins, but their skin isn't actually red at all.\" And I'm nearly 27, living in the rural Deep South. You'd think misconceptions like those would run rampant down here. But no, I've never heard any of them. Actually, I haven't hear of most every \"common misconception\" of ANY minority group as being anything other than a misconception. It just makes me question where are all these people who actually have those misconceptions to make them common? Not saying any of these or any other minority are making it up. That'd be a weird thing to make up. It just doesn't make sense. Common like... Of the misconceptions that very few have, these are the most common among those?

HARUKO!!!\n\nWe are under 18. Japanese Kid NEEDS!\n\n--- \n\nApparently there was a huge problem with security guards (which japan always warns against) at stores and various places in Maryland. It just looked to foolish, we respect police not security guards who behave like gangs supposedly protected the ultrarich beyond the extent of the law.\n\nWhen you have lots of security guards it's always unfair and in this situation they were annoying and encouraging racial strife and they were charged for having pedophilia.\n\nModern kids usually have no racial trauma in their early childhood unlike kids from the 60s, the attempt of guards to make everything about racism and transcending it wasn't good because we had more creative ideas that are not based on black/white models, but the zen that is beyond that. \n\nNow that they are gone kids of all heritages feel more able to be ourselves whether it's our traditional heritage image a mixmatch or something nonconformist. \n\nWe are not being guilted to chose one story or perspective or convinced everyone who looks like that does these \"insert behavior here\" things. \n\nAs a result we have better stories art music and more relevant things happening in the world. \n\n----\n\nIN REALITY the stories that were most compatible with the modern world right now we're Japan's, Greece and Ireland. The truth is a lot of us are very interested. \n\nOur sincere heart is not with the mythos of these other people's however we respect it as equal!\n\nIn the world where mass media exists, this is what you will see most often by far. \n\nIt seems mean but in reality the Gods are just asking us what we like, we tell them in a vote and then they know what the majority is, no blame. \n(Mainly because these myths offer us access from the comfort of home with all our culture comforts we are used to, the other ones are literally trying to get us out in strange environments and it makes it more difficult, few do those but the reward is great if sincere, in contrast SO MANY do the japanese Greek and Irish ones)\n\n\n\n\n....\nÊ∏ÖÊΩî love you, tripping „Éè„Éº„Éà„ÉÅ„É£„ÇØ„É© ...

SPIRITOFSHAWNHUNTERANDCORYMATTHEWS, it looks like teepees and suburban houses, these native americans have ancestral peace SOSEN NO HEIWA with us, because we've respected mother nature DAKARA SUNCHOU HAHANARUDAICHI.... our parents are honored THEYGOCRAZYFORNIHON.... I saw to the root of time which is that no matter what season they try to say it is, its actually only ever been now and now never really goes away, therefore time is not real and that means that weed is not physical, its an angel from a dream, which means that the world is like angelic.the roof opened up and the sky god mizochigabi accepted our thanks for this, smiling through heavenly clouds, mizochigabi just lunches, lunching Buddha. mizochigabi is the comedian when it is ther you eat well, whether serious or funny, you laugh, its healthy, it doesn't make fun of races. lol... its just thankful forest life technology from the HAWAIIAN BABYWOODROSE spirit that we have to be thankful for..its like, aloha...

I guess it wants to encourage us to kind of just say our style of communication is celestial and we don't feel shame for that which is most comfortable to us,  its also not what many people seem to believe it is.

Accept maybe the Irish, apparently, I read on Wikipedia, liked Buffalo Bill, but that things always full of..., or that they gave money to the Irish, or something. Maybe there's still a chance I could play this thing off?",

You are made to believe that you can claim entitlement over this great land. However, it is fact that the ‚ÄúPale‚Äù skinned mongoloids weren't enslaved do to there lack of technological advancements and their lower levels of thinking. It is not at all hard to see an example of this for it is true that your people believed you get reparations for stolen land. Who in the right mind would give there land to lying foreign invader and later fight back after they have the upper hand. As for the real red skins ‚ÄúAfrican-Americans‚Äù my people were killed, traded, and or enslaved do to our willingness to fight and our higher state of consciousness. It is clearly apparent that the white established governance over this glorifying land still to this day oppresses my people because they dont want the truth to be revealed.",

Look at any Mexican today they look little to nothing like the Native Americans you seen before they were \"colonized by white people\". They were literally orientals with dark skin. Almost all of Mexicans today look Middle Eastern. There was a Mexican educator who tested his genealogy and found he was Jewish. He did this for some 60 other people and found they were all Jewish even though they claimed \"pure\" Native American heritage. So yes, if Mexico was \"conquered by the evil whites\" as our \"History texts\" so claim wouldn't all Mexicans today be blonde haired with blue eyes like the Norwegians are? I just love how today's generation of \"Mexicans with Native heritage\" attack white people for the Native massacre yet have zero connection to these people. Because they're ALL Jewish and stole their identity!",

Native Americans and the French helped each other during fights. And I'm saying this from the perspective of someone who is half Native half French and from someone who knows my history. What are you talking about?",

So to be honest, insisting on being called Native American is worse. At least with \"Indian\", you're just rolling with a mistaken use of proper nouns. But with native \"American\", you choose to ide tify with the white man's name for the land he took.\n\nJust refer to yourself as your tribe name. And as to skmething you said to someone else, yes there were nations. Northeastern Peoples of the Land had nations and confederacies with permanent settlements. They did not roam. The People of the Plains roamed, but by the time Europeans arrived, there was no connection between the two.

When he reached Brazil he thought he had reach India, therefore the coined term \"√çndios\". I mean it's quite understandable for Europeans to call natives Indians by mistake, because chances are, in their native languages natives have a name very similar to Indians. I find it quite funny not being ok being called Indians but ok called native Americans. The continents were named by Europeans. If the incas were still a thing today they wouldn't be called native Americans would they? American tribes were never unified and ruled by a single leader were they? Why would they accept being lumped all together with the term native Americans. China was composed by various little kingdoms ruled by a central government for example. Just call yourself by your tribal names, indegenous people. I'm curious, do tribal languages have developed vocabularies? Like is there a word for the continent of America (and other continents)? Do you consider yourselves Americans? As in citizens of the USA? Do you call yourself native Americans because you're Native Americans (NATIVE USA) or Native Americans (NATIVE  CONTINENTAL AMERICA)? if it's due to the second logic it would make some sense I guess, but if it's for the first logic wouldn't it make more sense calling yourselves (tribal name) -Americans? I don't know any tribe names, I'm not American sorry :/",

There are some other theories behind why Native Americans are referred to as Indians (such as Columbus thinking he was sailing to the Indies, aka Asia), however I think this is a beautiful representation of the kindness of the Native American culture.",

I just feel sad because people are so narrowed minded my family is from Mexico and I was born in America, however people just label me as a Mexican. Although I do not have citizenship in Mexico and I have never been to Mexico and my DNA test reveal that I am a accumulation of different races. I find it fictitious how the USA dictates who can call themselves Native American and who can't. I am 40% Native American yet no one considers me Native American.",

(admittedly, less so in some countries like Guatemala and Peru, true.) This has created a distinct \"mestizo\" culture that is neither European or Native, but caught in between. So the general Latino culture doesn't seem that Native compared to Native people that grow up in tribes and speak Native languages and practice Native religions. Yes, the Native ancestry and identity should still be acknowledged. It just seems like the majority of Latinos are not that in touch with that Native identity and too much has been forgotten.",

They're not disrespecting anything, they have a choice on how they want to individually lead their own lives, and if theirs is a conscious choice unclouded by outside pressure, so be it. You don't have to pay homage to anybody. Regardless, here people have a very poor understanding of history it seems anyway. There is a reason why things are different, one of which is the policies that the Anglos and the Latins tended to follow in their colonisation efforts. The British often employed segregation, a thing the Anglo-americans have carried on doing with the US. While the Spanish and Portuguese often used a policy of assimilation/integration, out of necessity usually. This is why race is such a huge issue in the US compared to the other Latin American nations.",

Look at any Mexican today they look little to nothing like the Native Americans you seen before they were \"colonized by white people\". They were literally orientals with dark skin. Almost all of Mexicans today look Middle Eastern. There was a Mexican educator who tested his genealogy and found he was Jewish. He did this for some 60 other people and found they were all Jewish even though they claimed \"pure\" Native American heritage. So yes, if Mexico was \"conquered by the evil whites\" as our \"History texts\" so claim wouldn't all Mexicans today be blonde haired with blue eyes like the Norwegians are? I just love how today's generation of \"Mexicans with Native heritage\" attack white people for the Native massacre yet have zero connection to these people. Because they're ALL Jewish and stole their identity!",

There are Black Albinos with no Caucasoid genes. \n\nThese girls and her people are proclaiming to be Native Indians are not light skin. They are Caucasoids. We know the difference. We know our own people. The government made your Caucasoid ancestors Indians by paying $5.00. Your ancestors did just that. They paid $5.00 to be in a tribe they were never a part of in the beginning. These girls cannot teach on something they know nothing about. There are still Black Indians in America. They were told by their ancestors who they were.\n\nUnfortunately, these girls' ancestors fought to have the real Indians pushed out of their own tribes to live among the other Black people. The Native Americans will pay for their wickedness against God's people. I hope the $5.00 they paid was worth stealing the identity of other people. Being tricked by your own people does not excuse the theft.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3hr4gECoYZM",

If you're a member of your nation or tribe and you're active in the tribe, then you're native, full stop. It doesn't matter if you have blonde hair and blue eyes, if you're a member of your tribe, then you're native. \n\nTo address the myth of the one singular native look, let's just put it this way: you're lumping indigenous Americans into one group, when in reality, there are many many different nations and tribes in many many different locations around the US.  Not only that, but you're also basing the \"native look\" on a stereotype. One's skin color is determined, yes, by genetics, but also in part by the environment the people live in.  For example, a member of the Apache nation (SW United States) might have darker skin than a member of the Miami nation (Midwestern United States).  Not only that, but basing race on phenotypes alone is wholly unreliable. My grandmother is 3/4 Native (not revealing tribe name) and she has the lightest blue eyes you've ever seen.  But her mother and father both had dark brown hair and dark brown eyes. \n\nThe group y'all label as \"Native American\" is such a diverse group that I feel as though it is a crime to just lump us all together as one group, because it creates this idea that all tribes are essentially the same and believe the same thing which is entirely false, but that's a different argument for a different day.\n\nThis is a long post and a long read, but I just had to address this comment to talk about these issues.",

The history and achievements of say the Tarascan and Mayans are different than say...the Iroquois, Cherokee and Sioux. Nothing against them, but these are different people.

About 90-95% of Natives died from disease in the first years of contact (Smallpox, Hepatitis A, yellow fever, plague, influenza, etc.) but in the aftermath there was of course genocide of remaining tribes in both North and South America. European colonization wouldn't have been possible, however, if the Natives had had any immunity to all of these diseases. The rest of the world had already paid the price for these diseases centuries before with continuous waves of outbreaks and repeatedly massive death tolls throughout Europe, Asia and Africa that had earned all these people immunity, so in a sense the Native Americans were simply playing catch up and this high death toll was inevitable.",

Today, Native population at 15 million, while European population ( in continents of America + Europe) at ONE BILLION! What would it be like today if native Americans have possessed some sort of nuclear weapons to defend themselves? The answer is they would still have their own beloved motherlands, plus their population comparable to that of European population, period.\r Google 'Continents of America is Not a New World/China Daily' for more. \n\n http://blog.chinadaily.com.cn/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=820652",

On 2 and 5,A lot of people don't know much about Native Americans (usually people not from America) so it would be understandable since they wouldn't know a lot about Natives. On 6 though,Natives were called redskins because of scalping. The conjunction 'Red-skin' was used during the 19th century when scalp hunting was on going. The main reason why this happened was to \"Annihilate\" the rest of the Native Americans from existance. When a native was scalped,blood ran down their face,thus calling them a red skin.",

We are talking about two civilized cultures on different levels of knowledge on the principles of living in communities tribal laws, spiritual ways of living giving respect to all that is as far as the eye can see especially for the 5 civilized tribes that were in Seminole, Creek, Chickasaw, Choctaw and Cherokee nations and those of the Northern part of the American tribes.

Only a younger uneducated a Tribal member would be so rude to say: \"you're about to get schooled\". A much better title to this would have been: \"6 misconceptions about the Tribal Heritage of These Few People\". Agh. This is just spreading more misconceptions.

The Cleveland Indians actually had drafted the first Native American player sometime I think near the 1920s or so.

    "commentText": "I think that another misconception is that we are all one monolith group. Aside from cultural differences, such as the fact that our languages and dialects differ between tribes, not every Native agrees on every political issue. For example, it was great to see tribes in solidarity against DAPL, and even though my mother's family is from Standing Rock, some of my father's family in OK didn't understand why there were protests. It's ridiculous to me how a Native female can blindly support Trump and attack BLM and hate immigrants and be crazy over guns and not be affected by any mass shootings. One Native girl I got into an argument with didn't believe that she could be racist for spouting bullshit about black people or Muslims or Mexicans. I had friends from all three groups growing up.  I didn't grow up on a reservation and that was my parents' choice. My father had to deal with outright racism from segregation back in the 60's, 70's, and 80's, and my mother was adopted out before ICWA by a white family.  I'm glad to live in a generation where advocacy is much more accessible and normal than it was for my parents. That is why I speak out and share my history. It's also why I show solidarity with people of color who welcome support.",

It was a Native American that designed the mascot for the Redskins. So stop it! And don't tell me I'm a racist because I too am part Native American. My great grandma was full-blooded Cherokee, my grandpa was half Cherokee and my mom I'm 1/4 Cherokee. I love the Native American people and I to believe that they have been mistreated greatly by our government.",

    "commentText": "Yay. Okay I like this. As an Ojibwe/Potawatomi person I have a few things to say. I like when people reach out to learn about other cultures although I wouldn't say I'm the best person to come to for information. I'm still young and learning. Obviously I don't speak for every Indigenous/Native/Aboriginal/Indian (whatever you prefer). I speak for me and what I understand.\n\nTiipiis - I haven't met anyone who geninuinely thought I lived in a tiipii. My teacher, actually, in elementary school went to visit another school off reserve and the kids there thought we lived in longhouses and tiipiis and that we don't have candy which I found hilarious. But making a tiipii or wiigwam is something that I have done with my family and elementary school. Fire pit, scone and everything.\n\nGovernment funding - Not so familiar with this topic, I admit. I do get funding. On my reserve, members get a significant amount of zhoonyaa for various things like schooling. As for healthcare, same as any Canadian.\n\nTaxes - I have a status card that I can use on purchases that takes taxes off. Completely? I don't think so?\n\nCasinos. A reserve near me does have a popular Casino. And gambling is also an issue.\n\nHeadresses - Completely agree with the girls. It is sacred and something earned, not bought.\n\nRedskins - I don't know if it's just me but this doesn't bug me so much, only when it turns into something used in a negative way. The term \"Indian\" I've also used. I don't mind. I know many people that don't mind either. I also know many people DO mind. I mean, just stay frosty. I think the name \"person of colour\" annoys me more than anything because, well, everyone has colour in their skin.\n\nThis is just what I know. \n\nIt's unfortunate that a large amount of hostility comes with the interactions of natives and non-natives. Admittedly on both sides. Yes, there has been a LONG history of racism, cultural genocide and other things with the last residential school closing in just 1996. We won't forget it and we shouldn't but we should also not let it make us bitter moving forward. Correcting someone if they're incorrect is good and being open to learning about us is good too. \"Reconciliation\" is the goal.",

Also, don't let any of these comments deter you from saying what is true about your culture. And how dare anyone that isn't Native American come on here and comment that  what these girls have to say about their history is wrong. There are so many different aspects and truths depending on the tribe and country you live in as a Native American. Some may have to pay taxes, and some may not. . These girls are being honest about their experience. \n\nIt's so nice to be able to live life in ignorance. Then when someone tries to inform you of their culture, people get mad.

You have Indian high schools naming their teams \"redskins\". In fact before this drama even began, 9/10 Indians were found to believe that the name is not racist. Now the left has politicized and brainwashed these people into believing it is racist. Sports teams like the Braves and Redskins obviously revere native Americans, why the fuck would they name their team after an insult. \n9. That scalping story is complete, utter bullshit.

By that logic we need to take a poll on who is offended by each team mascot in America and if the results are 100% 'not offended' then it must go. Is that what you're trying to tell me right now?

If your gonna say something, use children, young girls, to deliver the message because who gonna get mad at them? How can you talk back against sweet young girls just trying to live happy lives. Drives me nuts. Its like when you see those starving kids in Africa videos around Christmas. why is it always focused on kids? Because no one cares about the adults. No one shows all these sad adults, only the kids. if they just show the adults its only because they have children. Its an emotional ploy. Also, i would love the \"white skins\" lol it could be hilarious.",

Another example are how Native American schools get low funding which leads to higher drop out rates. Not to mention how their schools are understaffed and some of them are infested with rodents (more things that can cause sickness). Natives already have a lower life expectancy than the average. Housing discrimination is another example of the racism they face. If you're just looking at percentages obviously it's gonna say white ppl experience police brutality the most (white ppl make up about 60%-70% of the population, clearly) but if you break it down like many studies have Natives and blacks experience it the most. You really need a definition of violent crimes....? Are you being serious? How about rape, murder, assault, hate crimes, etc. Don't be dense. Oh and btw you can look up all of these things if you don't believe them, finding this information is easily accessible if you have internet or a library card.",

Why do you need the names of specific Natives Americans who experience police brutality, do you think the statistics are just making up lies? How will a list of names prove that they experience it more when the stats will prove that? You aren't making sense. Do you know how this type of research even works? Have you even done research on police brutality? Cases about Native Americans experiencing police brutality are rarely reported about, so all there is the statistics. Which is what you should be looking for because it'll prove my point even more. Low funding is directly relate to the drop out rate going up, which is why it happens more in schools that don't get any funding. If schools aren't being funded and students don't even have books to learn from why would they keep going to school? You're obviously very privileged and haven't experienced going to a school in a low income neighborhood that doesn't get any government funding, that's good for you. But that's not the experience for a lot of other people. There's been articles about Natives experiencing housing discrimination, a study was done by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and it showed that 1 in 4 Natives experienced housing discrimination. Since you want names for some reason one of the articles was about a man named Ken Hebah. I mentioned the lower life expectancy because of environmental racism that contaminates poor neighborhoods including reservations where Natives live, a lot of them don't have health insurance because they're in poverty so if they get sick they won't be able to go to the hospital for care or medication. Read and comprehend what I'm saying before you reply or I'll just end up repeating myself. None of those team names you listed are slurs or offensive toward white people. So idk why you even tried with that lol, white ppl are hilarious",

For example, You claim that American Indians have a higher dropout rate. But, you can't prove that this is a result of racism. All you have proven is American Indians choose (that's the key word there, choose nobody forced them ) to drop out more than others. There is no link to racism that you have provided. Articles is not scientific evidence. There are articles claiming that the earth if flat, it doesn't make it true. What is the evidence of this so called \"housing discrimination\" ? Did the landlord say that they denied them specifically because of their race ? Did they say, we don't rent to Indians ?  What is environmental racism ? The environment is not racist. Rain clouds do not target specific races to rain on. They are poor because of racism ?  So white people are stopping American Indians from getting a job, becoming rich, and moving away ? Sorry, no, that is not how life works in America. Nobody is preventing them from getting a job. Nobody is forcing them to live there. They can move off the reservation. They can live wherever they want. Nobody is stopping them from getting health insurance. Again, what makes you think I'm white ? Assuming my race is racist.",

Some tribes don't pay tax especially if they live on a reserve. NO ONE THINKS NATIVE AMERICANS STILL LIVE IN TIPIS THAT'S FUCKING RETARDED. \n\nYou have 5 kids from at most 5 different tribes out of 500 saying they don't get government handouts. What tribe are they from? Where does that tribe live? Not all tribes get handouts but a good chunk of them do (But these aren't even really handouts it's more government paying the interest they owe to certain tribes). \n\nSome of these misconceptions don't even exist, like they had to make some of these up \"All native americans wear headresses\" who the fuck thinks that. I haven't found anyone in life or online that has said or thought that. \n\nAlso I've found polls and studies that suggest that 9/10 or 96% of native americans aren't offended by the term redskins. In fact there are a lot of little league teams run by native americans that have \"redskins\" in their names. So this just sounds like liberal propaganda bullshit. \n\nSeriously why do you have little kids talking about shit like their experts or even understand taxes. This is how the liberals  and the left get you, they use kids to push their agenda. Just like that swearing kids video, it's disgusting.",

Also they have status cards where they don't pay tax at Walmarts. 7, the amount of money depends on your tribe. 8..... I'm pretty sure everyone knows the chief gets to wear the head dress.... and it's only in some tribes. 9.... 94% of natives didn't give a shit about the name redskins in 2004, now that all this liberal bullshit has taken over, the numbers of people who DO give a shit is in the 90%' s \nNo ones discriminating against you, and the world isn't run by white supremacist.

Whites have been eating sugar cane for 1,000 years so our bodies process it, they have been eating it for about 100 years or less.  YOU DO receive lots of government money in the form of welfare and in the form of reformation for broken land treaties . Some Indians receive a monthly check from casinos as part of this deal.  YOU DONT pay taxes. Everything bought and sold on the rez has no fed or state tax and in some states you are even exempt from their state income tax.  No one believes that all Indians wear headdresses, nor do they believe the ones that do, wear them all the time. Native Americans name their own fucking baseball teams Redskins. No one names their own team a derogatory name. Whites name their teams redskins because they admire American Indians, they name their war machines after Indians because they admire them for their toughness and combat skills i.e. Apache helicopter.  American Indians used to scalp people and keep the scalps to get paid by the French or the British for each person they killed. Yes you used to do that, stop LYING.   Indians are beautiful people who used to be non political except concerning their own tribal business. Stop politicizing these innocent kids and making them into your little liberal pets.",

Some of those ways include rejecting entire groups of people for purported inferiority (social, moral, or intellectual) or deviation from the (culturally determined) norm. \n\nMuch humor involves punching up.  It's a defense mechanism. It's how we deal with an uncertain life and those in power. It keeps us from screaming.\n\nOther humor punches sideways. That's why comedians poke fun at their own groups: their intimate knowledge lets them comment on the absurd parts of their group's culture. \n\nAs for punching down: what is funny about degrading and insulting those who lack power? It's saying \"I resent you for existing\" or \"You are so abnormal that we must defend the group from you\" or \"I assert my power over you so my friends won't mock me as weak.\"",

'White' refers exclusively to people of European ancestry (preferably Germanic and Celtic populations). Jews, Arabs, Turks, Afghanis, and so forth are not 'white enough' for the people who think the KKK is a heroic organization.\n\nThe names that white people imposed on those they conquered carry weight. Those names deny the differences among the non-EuroWhite population of the planet. They carry meanings of cowardice, stupidity, laziness, passivity, latent violence, immorality, barbarism, and inferiority.\n\nYou haven't seen many Asians if you think they all have light skin. \n\nWe whites stole people from Africa to work our mines and fields. They lost their ethnic and religious identities along with their names. 'Black' is the least-freighted imposed identity. By contrast, the various Asian peoples brought to Europe and the Americas kept their ethnic identities fairly well, along with their languages and religions. They identify as of Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, etc. in ancestry while also primarily as citizens of their countries of birth.",

Look at any Mexican today they look little to nothing like the Native Americans you seen before they were \"colonized by white people\". They were literally orientals with dark skin. Almost all of Mexicans today look Middle Eastern. There was a Mexican educator who tested his genealogy and found he was Jewish. He did this for some 60 other people and found they were all Jewish even though they claimed \"pure\" Native American heritage. So yes, if Mexico was \"conquered by the evil whites\" as our \"History texts\" so claim wouldn't all Mexicans today be blonde haired with blue eyes like the Norwegians are? I just love how today's generation of \"Mexicans with Native heritage\" attack white people for the Native massacre yet have zero connection to these people. Because they're ALL Jewish and stole their identity!",

I cant speak for other tribes but the Navajo is the most numerous in the southwestern U.S  the  Navajo Nation Reservation is on the same land our ancestors walked upon we never got exiled off of it .We still make the same arts rugs basket weavings,sandpaintings, hogans,drawings of certain charachters as those that archeologists found in the ancienr ruins at Chaco Canyon,Mesa Verde Cliff dwellings,Shiprock,Windowrock,Pueblo Pintado,Four Corners Monument Navajo Nation Southern Utah,Colorado,northern New Mexico,Arizona the Navajo Nation all the way through Apache Country Pine Top Arizona the beautiful White Mountain Apache Reservation We are still on all the very same lands that our ancestors walked upon .I dont know why people use us for thier political bullcrap liberal leftist race baiting lies.The Navajo Code talkers were honored when presidenr Trumo went out to honor them with awards and he told the Elizabeth Warren pocahontus joke which we thought was funny I got a funnier one  I say she is from the Wannabeewee tribe of wannabees .They told Trump they did not get offended when people yelled Geronimo while jumping out of planes. I never even heard the term Native American until the 90s sometime. We older school natives do  not start tripping or get all butthurt at the word indian . Please fact check me on all that I have said  Go look on youtube for a song by Keith Secola its one of my favorites  its called \" Riding in my Indian Car.They try to teach us to hate Christopher Colombus well I cant hate the spaniards because I have a little bit of spanish in my blood that is what Nakai Yaz means in Navajo.Please donr think all natives go around pkaying the victim race card .We are a very quiet people who do not practice a lifestyle of complaining or living in the past To rehash old wounds is not our way.To live in misery and unforgiveness is not something honorable The idea that anyone who claims to be native would go  around crying about stolen land to me would be dishonoring the warriors or old and to dishonor the decisions that were made.We dont think on coulda shoulda woulda so to speak We are to be grateful for each new day of life and what is now To live in and enjoy the present moment so to speak.To live in such a way that youre rehashing old wounds has got to bring extrem misery and sadness Talk about oppressing your very own spirit  Thats so tragic  I find it very hard to believe these people who complain the loudest crying out in anger and misery of the past and demanding others do something in order that they can have a better life i dont see how they can be real native people I dont believe they are real natives   if they are they have been greatly indoctrinated by the racebaiting crooked left globalist school of thought and have really really wandered far far away from the true native spirit .We dont need someone else ro make us happy peaceful or succesful  We know how to make that happen for ourselves We are free in America  unless you are in chains you are not oppressed in America.Im so tired of having to defend my white friends from all the undeserved race hate they get attacked with by liars claiming the land belongs to them  What nerve.I have never once seen or heard a reel injun from my tribe say such idiotic nonsense.There is so much more I would like to say but I will close for now. Blessings to You and Yours Im sorry about grammatical errors  i cant find my reading glasses\n.",

Which is why our attempts at aid go awry: we don't know how to work with the people.\n\nOur ancestors looked at the land that indigenous people lived on and saw property going to waste because it wasn't bounded by fences, threaded by roads, dotted with factory-towns, mines, farms, and estates. They felt no guilt because they saw it as God's gift to them, and every 'How can you own the land and the sky' question or protest was evidence that they were right.\n\nThey took the land by drawing lines on maps and building walls and fences along those lines. Anybody who 'didn't belong' was murdered or driven off. \n\nYou have all been fighting, in various ways, to keep what remains to you. \n\nElizabeth Warren never traded on her ancestry. It was a family story, nothing more. It was her political opponents who belittled her with their lies. Seems to me that the real wannabe Indians are the white people who decide that a Native ancestor from 1700 means they can cosplay their fantasy, or write those New Age books misrepresenting Native beliefs (or plain making stuff up).",

We fought with Mexico in 1870 and on Geronimo and his band of warriors were very small in number compared to the huge amount of mexicans that were mercenaries working hard to out all the Apaches on the extinction list.Mexico was heavily involved in the exact same thing they accusw whites of. I dont think you understand my position. I will NEVER surrender my right to defend myself. I know in the big picture of reality the Left wing and tge right wing are all part of the same muddypuppin bird !!! Im not fooled into believed any political propaganda for either side. If you think Trump is racist and hurts peoples feelings like so many brainwashed fools thats fine. I could care less about feelings Im not the little weakling with emotions so delicate that I need the democraps to be word nazis and police people not to offend my wittle feewings  .Thats how the democraps try to make people think all minorities are. I go by facts and Trump did alot of tangible real life things that I can see and feel in the lives of many minorities like opening up factories obama closed down ,the amount of jobs have blown up for minorities that were so relieved  to finally have jobs again. I know some black ,hispanic,apache and navajo people who believe the way I do but most importantly  Its a matter of life or death and being able to defend myself and my family if the mexicans or anyone else tries to come for us again and I chose Trump because that evil murdering hypicrite KILLARY actually thought everyone forgot how evil she treated women who were rape victims a child they recorded her laughing about getting a child molestor out of trouble I heard it with my own ears these are facts that Hilkary never denied I remember when her and bill called blacks super predators and she stole and exploited from the entire country just fact check haiti. My main concern is thatTRUMP DEFENDS OUR RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS AND KILLARY THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO IMPOSE GUN CONTROL AND ILL BE DAMED IF I WILL GIVE UP MY RIGHT TO PROTECT MYSELF !!! TRUMP must not be that racist he wants us to live and hillary wanted us disarmed look how she laughed about the dead soldiers at Bengazi and look how she never cared abiut women at all.whatever Trump did or said is not enough for me to bow to surrender my right to bear arms. Im not against mexico either Im just tired of alo the ones that talk trash and blame whites and have the nerve to say mexico fukn belongs to them then they try to hide their attempts at genocide  How convenient that they never mention all the Apaches they massacred   You shouldnt buy into all the left and right crap based on     feelings  you should decde on what will help your life personally .If they try to take our guns away I would rather die fighting and remember the Warriors who said   It is a good day to die .Hillary was the most evil and people who examine facts didnt fall for her bullshit anymore. Trump treated all of us natives so nice when he presented the code talkers in person with honorary its on Youtube  Thats not why I am for Trump though its more important to me that hes not trying to take our guns  like Killary anyway i cant find my reading glasses sorry for grammaticak errors  I hope you dont supoort soros",

I have never once in my entire 52 years of life hear any native yell at or blame white man for anything.There are way too many people speaking for us and explaining shit that I have never even seen or experienced. The Navajo and Apache tribes still live on the exact same land as our ancestors .We never claim to own the land or demand land back because that is not the way we believe We dont believe anyone owns the earth we walk upon. The Navajo Nation all the way to pine top arizona is very beautiful land .I hate to bust your bubble but white man has never oppressed me or caused me grief They have no power over my personal life to make me or mine miserable. I spend alot of time defending whites who get picked on when I lived in Los Angeles .I have lived on the reservation and in the city.I think you give yourself to much credit you are not responsible for what the powers that be or the government did way back when. We had more problems from Mexico than any white man 1870s Mexican government tried to wipe us all out  Fact check me on all I say  Apache Vs Mexico wars .Mexico is always railing accusations at white man demanding land back when they fought us here in the southwest and were worse then any whites thats for sure. Despite that all we dont go around rehashing old wounds .I see more happy peaceful natives about there business.The past was handled the way it was and people who go around demanding land back are a dishonor to thier ancestors who were warriors. People who dont enjoy the good that they do have in the here and now are the most miserable of all. To speak or natives in a way that groups us all together is a huge error ,we are all different  .Those who have been brainwashed to believe all that politicak propaganda have sadly strayed away from the true native spirit. I must say that you did not strip us of our language or our customs ,culture nothing .We still make the exact same rugs ,sandpaintings,pottery,hogans,weavings of baskets and all forms of art that were found by archeoligists at chaco canyon,mesa verde cliff dwellings four corner,shiprock,windowrock,lfrom Navajo Nation all the way through Apache country to pinetop arizona Indian country is beautiful and we didnt go away anywhere or get exiled from the land .I dont have ny reading glasses I can barely see the keyboard on my phone.I had to respond and I do it quickly regardkess of how manu errors I dont care to impress anyone with grammatical perfe tion.  I got things to do in this happy life of my .There are no sad indians sitting around dwelling on the past or feeling oppressed where i come from.Im sure there are some sad people some where but thats not the norm becuz even the natives who are not well off financislly love to laugh and live and enjoy life  We are not a weak unhappy brooding  people and we dont cinsider ourseoves these oppressed victims  I thiughtthe pocahontis joke was.funny  but we have our own joke about warren  she is from the wannabeewee tribe of wanna bees    .Im gonna go listen to riding in my indian  car by keith secols and enjoy my conquistador ancestry husband and clean up from thanksgiving while enjoying some politically incorrect music while I enjoy the technology the invaders brought lmao     Dont believe all you hear on tv or at libtard universities    we are not weak  victims in misery wasting away our lives nursing old wounds",

    "commentText": "Actually, If you do some REAL research you will find that the original Natives of North America were dark skinned and many Europeans like Christopher Columbus and numerous other's referred to them as dark skinned people with copper to reddish skin which is where the \"redskin\" definition actually came from. Because of the $5 Indian period where Europeans could \"buy\" into the native culture, they dropped the \"red skin\" description and called it negative or derogatory because they weren't red skinned people that fit the true definition of an authentic native. These are not real natives historically. Why didn't they have any of them say what tribe they're from? If they go by the Europeanized 5 so called civilized tribes names they are decedents of $5 Indians who have mixed in and are descendants of traitors that don't know the tribes original name. ask yourself, who built all of the hundreds of pyramids across North America that predates any tribe? Natives never built pyramids, they built mounds which was a different structure all together. The Africans that came over on land bridges etc built those pyramids thus the reason why original natives were dark colored ranging from copper tone to reddish. White supremacy is always busy lying! even got these people on here confused about who they are like everyone else! PLUS!!! No, all tribes don't get govt assistance, but the 5 so called civilized ones do have access to funds' schooling, casino money etc. They have documentary's out about that! do some research..sheeesh...smh",

People seem to think that the natives sat around and passed the peace pipe and it was all Great Spirit, nature, rainbows and unicorns, etc etc. They fought in wars and conquered other tribes for their land and resources just like the Europeans. Some tribes were incredibly savage killing women and children. The only true natives are those who first migrated here from the North after crossing the Bering Straight. As they settled more waves would migrate in pushing south and so on and so on. You don't think they fought each other? Look at how barbaric the South American tribes were. Blood and Death were a big part of their cultures. Some would raid other tribes for sacrifice victims. They have just as much blood on their hands as we do. We should not feel guilty for doing the same thing the natives did to each other for hundreds/thousands of years. So sick of the white guilt trip. Get the fuck over it and move on. They lost and we won.",

Natives do not all look like the cardboard cutout everyone sees in their head, they are a diverse group. With that said some of these girls did look like they have some white in their blood but i dont think they're 50/50, they probably still have a high % of native blood.

    "commentText": "I didn't get schooled. I already knew all this. Mostly because I live in an area where there are many natives. Growing up in an area where there was a lower population of natives, I was incredibly shocked and disappointed after I moved here. The majority of natives here are dirty and rude. They frequently steal and commit petty crimes. Many of them have this uneducated-sounding, mumbling accent they pick up on the reservation. Fucking ENUNCIATE. I work near a casino and the only people we ever see going in and out all day and night are Natives. Do they not work? Do they not have jobs? Many of them do get free money, and they will get a job for a short period and abruptly quit to work the system. They are given free money every year towards their reservations, yet the reservations still look like shit because they have no pride or cleanliness. My friend works in health care and she's told me countless stories about neglected and sexually/physically abused kids on the res. It's a SERIOUS problem. Alcohol is also a serious problem. Pine Ridge is about an hour from where I live, and it is literally the poorest shit stain in the US. Look it up. It sickens me when I see bumper stickers that say \"Native Pride.\" What are you proud of? Your ancestors would be just as disgusted with you. These people don't need their land back. They will only trash it. They feel entitled because this is their \"land.\" Yet, they don't do anything to better their situation or living conditions. Meanwhile they pop out multiple kids they can't afford. Their kids are running around with lice. They allow their children to be raped, sodomized and abused by their own uncles and cousins. I have NO respect for Natives. Not the ones like that, which is what I have to put up with day in and day out. Obviously not ALL Natives are like this, but in my experience (and where I live) MOST of them are. Cry if you want but these are FACTS. Just by doing a quick google search you can see that I'm not lying about the amount of abuse and criminal activities many Natives indulge themselves in. Alcohol abuse and sexual/physical abuse are rampant. Countless studies have proven it.\nAlso, not all Native land was stolen. There were many treaties and agreements in reference to land. Even for the land that was stolen... they aren't the only fucking people. Every single country has been invaded or had land stolen. Every single country has invaded or stolen land. Native Americans just happen to be one of the more recent examples, so people whine about it. In most other countries, these people weren't given land back. They weren't given free money from the government either. I hope you guys just realize that some of your tax money going towards Natives are really going to Playstations and hot cheetos at Walmart at the first of the month instead of the cause you THINK you're paying for.",

Same applies to schooling, if you're not status you pay for your schooling regardless of what your ethnicity.  Even with status, it's hard to obtain funding for post-secondary schooling.",

They are earned not given' out freely. I have war medals from my family that served in world war two and I don't wear then why, because I didn't earn them they did.

And child sacrifice was practiced all over the world, Abraham almost sacrificed his own son because it was testimony to the times and what was going on around him, child sacrifice... And on your American loved 300 movie, the early Spartans killed newborns they deemed unworthy based on a disability.. again, the world is to big to judge and point the finger.

The other small percentage were killed in war. And the overly exaggerated number white guilters like to use that a 100 million were killed is absurd considering there were only 2 million Native Americans on the continent at the time. I don't take kindly to being made to feel guilty for something I personally never had a part of. So if you throw it in my face i'm going to throw it back at you.",

During a specific period Native Americans were hunted for their scalps,  but at the same time Native Americans were hunting and torturing the white man. So don't pretend you were little Angels.",

Its a problem because we were the more advanced enemy?  Once the white man came to America they waged the war that ended all future Native American wars. If you look at that in aggregate that technically saved  millions of future Native American lives.  Maybe you wouldn't have even been born, if Europeans never came to America. Its similar to how the Nuclear bombs dropped on Japan killed many, but actually saved millions of lives by ending the war. I believe the Native Americans lost their land for a reason, it was for godlessness, sun worship, child sacrifices, idolatry, savage warfare, etc. Their sins added up and they received retribution. That might sound messed up, but It was meant for modern standards of civilized behavior to be forced onto them. European countries and every other country in the world has been punished in one way or another at some point as well.",

Natives fought with one another over different reasons,.. theft from one another which could be seen as raiding, conflicts over hunting territory, or things were personal, where someone was wronged in some way, that's why we had strong warrior men.. when the white man came over, our fighting was different, it became a long standing war, white people wanted the land, minerals, and timber, whatever they wanted to create America... so the war was more complex and intense, at first we were somewhat peaceful with whites, until more and more kept coming.. in time shit was bound to happen, we weren't going to go down without a fight.. a lot of craziness was remembered on all sides back then, White and Native, but we still had a voice and our own reasons for what we did, if it don't make sense to you, I don't know how else to put it, I already told you a lot to try and get you to understand, that even though we did some things, we were human, acting only as humans would in those times.. We didn't have the technologies that the other side of the world had, and we didn't unify enough to repel the invasion... Native American history is a topic that keeps getting mutilated and cofused, all angles need to be understood to get a good picture of what it is you are looking at... And genocide, submission, trickery, and forced removal ended the Indian Wars... And to say that innocents die for the greater good like in Hiroshima is sickening, that's a more modern example of how evil has escalated even since the Indian wars.. And your so called \"civilized\" country today is godless, you all worship the doller, you all spend more time in front of the tv or phones that makes you stupid, your country is gay, you have Satan churches in capitals and major towns, science rules the country, and racism still exists... America is corrupt, it lies to it's own people, it's unjust, and is backwards.. education is declining, crime is rising, there's a drug and alcohol abuse epidemic, so what is so perfect about this country that was built on Native blood and stolen land??",

The amount of exaggeration against Europeans during the time is disgusting. Most people have been misled to believe Europeans came here and just started massacring hundreds of millions of Native Americans. When really the amount of Natives murdered is in the thousands.\n\nHow is killing the few in order to save the masses disgusting? If you could allow 100,000 to die in order to save 2 million you wouldn't do it? Allowing the 2 million to die would be disgusting.\n\nI agree there is a lot of godlessness in America and the country receives its due retribution. Just as the Natives received their retribution.\n\n I think you worship pride a little too much.  Pride is a form of self worship. We should see ourselves as residents of the Earth, not of the specific piece of land we stand on.  When your ancestors came here through the Bering Strait 15,000 years ago they likely killed off whoever was here at the time.",

We suffered disease as an add on to the already struggling Apache Wars, I'm not saying that we didn't suffer from sickness and new diseases as bad as we did, but it will never alleviate the fact that, your right, thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, if the numbers were added up across Canada,  N. America, and S. America would add up in favor that Natives experienced genocide, you think we didnt. I'm not saying YOU harmed us  personally, I'm just saying we experienced it. And it is a known fact that disease did kill off a lot of the first Natives that came into contact with the early settlers, but that was not the only cause of Natives dying in the early colonization period of America... And I say you got it from tv, bcuz it says PBS, but now I realized you got your info from an internet article...

But I'm going to call you out on thinking that your white people \"did things\" for us, none of you did shit for us, our self-determination kept us alive, we fought to exist,.. your people woke up to consciousness and thought it was better and easier to make reservations for control and assimilation. And casinos were ideas thought of by each Tribal Council that decided to use Indian Gaming as a means to economically sustain the Tribes... our own will is why we have all we have, from reservations to everything we have. Yeah, poor people live on welfare, but it's a fact that not all Indians get free money from the govenment, like everyone else, you have to meet certain standards to get \"free\" shit... And if we make money on the rez, or any rez, it's through our own enterprises, not the government, anything the rez has ever offered me was through the rez, not the government, we take care of ourselves, at least we do on my rez... the government spends money on fake white Indian rezes that actually do exist, where a small Tribe of like 200 white people claim Indian blood, have white skin and get sovereignty somehow,... those Tribes you need to be looking into when it comes to \"free\" shit, and real Natives know Native, I can tell by facial features and skin color that stick out like the mountains in the ground,.... But those so called Natives are frauds and phonies... so go talk to them...",

Blond hair didn't even appear in Europe until 3,000-5,000 ¬†years ago. That trait was brought by the Steppe people. Southern Europeans were the first with color eyes but they were dark like Native Americans. Even today, Southern Europeans tend to have darker tones. I actually live in Spain now and I tend to be paler than most Europeans, the only things that differ are my features. Even features change through history due to diets and genetics changing. We will never be our ancestors and our future humans will not look like us. ¬†Even before the Europeans came to the Americas. There were light skin Native Americans. In the Aztec world, these children would be taken care as well as their families for the rest of their lives. The child would be sacrificed to the Gods after a certain age. Having a light skin baby was a huge deal in Native culture. In some USA tribes, these children were usually seen as gifted and could often tell you the future.",

Like the Mayans and even then. Tribes from the South are different then Tribes from Northen West part of Mexico, where they are actually more related to Apache's than Aztecs. Unless you have a DNA test that say's you are Aztec then props to you. I'm Miwok from Northen California and I'm still of Mexican descent. Jalisco to be exact and none of my DNA say's Aztec, in fact, it says that my nearest ancestors are those from the Nort West of Mexico and South West of the USA. Another fact America and Mexico were once just Native lands. If you know your culture you would know that there is no such thing as the concept of property in the Native World. This included all the Tribes from North to South. Like I stated before all North Americans. These include the tribes of the USA and Mexico are related. ¬†The Aztecs were nomadic tribes from the North before settling in present Mexico. They did not create their Empire they took parts of the Mayan relegion and actually build the city on top of what was left.",

I do believe in God or the Creator, and I believe God has many forms and manifestations. And to us Apaches we have a supreme being or Creator in our langugae, and there are spirits/angels, the g√°√°ns or mountain spirits, and there's Changing Woman and her son Monster Slayer who is like our Jesus. And there's all the other powers and spirits we recognize, animal spirits, celestial spirits, and earthly, like the mountains, trees, and water. We had a strong sense of life and we were intelligent people..\nBut it's good your learning, hopefully Natives continue educating themselves in their culture and heritage... We need more smart Injuns to combat today's failing society, a society that tries to rid itself of the Indians, or the Indian problem, today the battle is against assimilation, those who oppose our sovereignty, and against those who act as if the Natives never existed...",

The same people that take Justin Bieber seriously.  Morons.  You can like their music, just dont take them seriously on an intellectual level.\n\n- \"People still credit Elvis for Rock n Roll.\"\n\nElvis merely popularized it.  The origins of rock and roll are ambiguous at best, seeing as its a blend of several types of music from the early to mid 20th century America.  Or do you have a more precise definition?  And what makes it true?\n\n- \"I wouldn't be surprised considering that white people used to oppress people\"\n\nEvery race has oppressed people at some point for a prolonged period of time.  NO race or people are innocent in terms of history.  Why is it that ONLY white people are demonized for something everyone else has done?  Looking down on white people for things that used to happen only shows your own bigotry.\n\n- \"and they hardly ever put the name of inventors that were not white.\"\n\nWell, until someone comes forth with a more accurate depiction of what happened, whos to say that the status quo is wrong?  You?  Show me the proof.\n\n- \"They would put \"unknown\" or no inventor at all.  Just look at the artifacts.There is physical proof that they would not give credit where its do and modern proof at that. Not just something written in a book.\"\n\nDo you have proof of that?  Besides, has it ever occurred to you that maybe the reason things are labeled as \"unknown\" is because nobody actually knows?  Since you seem to know everything, maybe you should go work at that office, that way everything will get labeled correctly.\n\nSeriously though.  Proof.  Bring it.  Please.

Natives were not CONSTANTLY engaged in war because their tribes were spread further apart.  It would take months to travel sometimes to an enemy's territory through brutal weather and climate.  It was easier to be allies with tribes.  Most would have trade agreements or marriages to keep peace. This is why Natives began dividing territory among each other to make sure everyone had their own territories.   It wasn't until the introduction of the horse that more raids too place.  The horse was introduced by Europeans.  And again, they never tricked any one that was their ally.  They never fought allies.

There were of course those who ran for months to aid those on the other side of the Iroquois and south American nations, but that wasn't particularly common. My point mostly was that it was a lot like medieval Europe in terms of travel distances. Less so in many cases because they didn't travel in massive armies requiring slower speeds and massive supply chains. \n\nOn them trusting Europeans, yeah they could have handled that better. For the first 50 years, they had the upper hand on regular occasion, but kept not following through by the anthropology books I've read. They always would have lost by resisting, Europe just had too high a birthrate at the time and too large a military base, they would never have stopped. But the indians could have tried to work from a position of strength and absorb the incomers and take on their strengths instead. \n\nHonestly though, they did alot better than their more developed south American cousins against the Spanish.

The Spaniards were simply the more effective monsters. Read an anthropology text some time. Something with actual research and references. \n\nOn the rest of it, genocide and pogroms were rampant across africa for the 7000 years of recorded history; sporadic across the 5000 years of white history and systematic across the 6000 years of Asian history.\n\nWhat we now call warcrimes? That was standard military doctrine until more or less the Napoleonic wars, the world over. Making them crimes didn't really stop them, but its still a white moral system trying to limit them. We more or less have to force it on other cultures. Even today. Especially africa and the middle east where they're still culturally acceptable. \n\nMass rape? Every single culture across their entire history. Where war went, rape was left in it's wake. It's STILL rampant all over africa. Very sporadic and individual in white countries. \nAnd child rape? Legal in the middle east. Illegal in every white country, even though it still happens.",

    "commentText": "My response to each statement: \"Native Americans still live in tipis.\" First of all, not all tribes even used tipi's but a majority of plains tribes did like the ones I come from and no, that era of living has ended around the late 1800's, early 1900's I believe.\n\"Native Americans get lots of handouts.\" This is a widespread belief amongst a lot of non-natives. Even if they did, it might've been because the government made treaties where they promised direct help in exchange for land in the past but as we all know, most treaties are not even practiced or respected.\n\"Native Americans don't pay taxes. lol I'm Native and only 21 and I pay taxes. If you're Native and live and work on the reservation you are exempt from state tax I believe but you are still subject to federal tax but if you are native and work off the reservation then you are still subject to state and federal. It might have to be due to the fact that reservations are considered \"sovereign.\" I'm not completely sure.\n\"Native Americans are rich off of casinos.\" Some native tribes have gained a lot of financial prosperity from casinos but that is a small number of tribes who have and those tribes usually have strict enrollment qualifications and sometimes low enrollment so even that is a low percentage of natives. I know damn well my tribes are not rich off of our casinos. lol\n\"All native Americans wore headdresses.\" Not all tribes do wear headdresses and not every tribes headdress were alike. Also there were different kinds of headdresses as well. My tribe wore headdresses but like they stated, only certain people are allowed to wear them.\n\"Another word for Native Americans is redskin.\" There's no word like that in our language. I never have once heard someone within our own people call ourselves redskin. I personally don't like the term either. I personally would rather be called by my tribe.\nI have been asked these types of questions before and thankfully, the non-natives who ask are always willing to listen and try to understand. I have been asked so many crazy questions on \"being native\" as well, it is crazy. lol",

Then moved to stick built long houses in the summer where all the family lived together. But today, for the Eastern Band Cherokee anyway it's mostly trailers. We're still a poor people but live in the same \"houses\" as everyone else.. Although I have to say, I AM drawn to the forest and tents! Haha!!",

The media loves to group all of north america together and all of south america together and not even address the fact that quite a lot of those tribes have more to do with people from the other continent than people east or west of them.\n\nWhite man seems to think his influence on us is greater than the thousands of years of culture, but it's not true. Y'all also seem to think the American colonies, France, Spain, the Dutch, and Portuguese all explored and conquered in the same manner.  I've more in common with an Arawak than a Cheyenne. Not just because of our shared pre-european history, but because our european-american history is more similar as well. I'm not Crow. I wasn't Crow thousands of years ago, I wasn't Crow hundreds of years ago, I'm not Crow now, but you damn sure can't tell by this video.",

I loved your video but in somethings it is not good to speak for all Native Americans.  I live in Oklahoma.  I am not a Native American but I'm learning about some of the tribes.  I have had a Choctaw tell me about benefits they receive.  He was encouraging us to see if we where Choctaw so we could get the benefits too.  In Oklahoma, there are special Clinics and hospitals for Native Americans.  I don't know if they are free or reduced priced.  There is some benefit to going to them or people would not drive over an hour to go to them.  We have Indian WIC which I was told is better than normal WIC.  Much of these benefits come from the revenue of the casinos owned by the various tribes.",

One was a lie, the other was an individual, subjective case. Also, ''where have you people worked for shit?'' just so you know my mom's friend lives in the US and has to work her ass off on two jobs.

I live in a predominately white and Native state, and a majority of whites don't fucking work. I also live in a Republican state, which are known to recieve most benefits, and those who recieve benefits are broken up by their race and percentage of how many of each race accepts welfare. But you're retarded and can't understand statistics, so...\n\n\nAnd obviously, your \"mom's friend\" is living beyond her means and that isn't anyone's issue. You only have two jobs if you're living beyond your means, have more kids than what you can afford, or make poor financial choices. Not anyone's fault but her own.\n\nBlacks and Whites are the two races that eat up the majority of welfare. That's facts whether you like it or not, Trigglypuff.",

Together they could EASILY over take the rich and bring about change but the poor are to busy hating other poor so nobody goes after the rich because divided we fall...Actually they still do it.

I happen to be Native Paiute, Mexican, A bit of German on my Grandmothers side, and much more. Lots of people are mixed race. Also the Aztec lived in adobe houses. Which is made of clay. It comes from the earth but it is not mud. Also Spaniards are not the same. They are the ones with light skin and blonde hair.

My people almost died off because of European invaders. Not only that we almost completely lost our culture because of Boarding Schools where Natives couldn't even speak their language without being punished. Why do you think so few of us speak in Nuum (Paiute language). Even I know only short phrases in it like Manahuu and Paya. Height does not equal superiority its even been shown that shorter people have more efficient bodies. The reason we did not live like Europeans has to do with philosophy. My people were part of the land and respected it. Europeans thought that land was meant to be conquered and thus did not respect it. They killed Buffalo out of sport while the tribes relied on the Buffalo for food,clothing, and tools. Our stories even warn us about being greedy with the earth. For example the story of Coyote and the Ducks where he tried to take more ducks than he was supposed to and lost all of them because of his greed.",

And it makes my blood boil when people call us Indians because we're not. Like first you take our land from us, kill thousands of our people, bring sicknesses to America that we didn't even have before, and on top of that people are going to call us \"Indians\". I can't.

        "commentText": "Chassity Oubre What do you mean? I never said anything racist or stereotypical. Welfare has become an epidemic issue in the U.S, not because its a bad idea, but because its an easy system to cheat and has been used to do so, especially in places like Detroit and Milwaukee. Imagine that the government gives you X-amount of money each month for simply applying to a job or having Y-amount of children, but not working a job or taking care of said children. The same applies to charities in foreign countries. The economy collapses because they aren't making money or learning the trade, they are simply piggy backing. Point being that waving a magical wand and giving people free stuff because they have certain DNA (which is how a monarchy works, which was the downfall of some major European nations) doesn't solve anything and only angers other groups, because it isn't fair. It isn't a bad thing to be on welfare, especially when you are trying to get out of it. Its another thing to sit their and expect things out of it without an applicable skills to a certain trade. Now, only 22% of Natives actually live in poverty where all assistance is needed. What about all the Natives that are financially stable and educated? They should get free benefits for being born that way? This is exactly the issue I was warning you about; A simple system like that is so easy to cheat. And its not a simple \"I cheated, my bad\" type of thing. Its something that effects other people, so why can't these Natives use simple goverment assistance like everyone else? Aren't we all trying to be equal? America has had many equality breakthroughs in the last two century's, has it not? No ones enslaved, no ones being killed, everyone can get an equal opportunity to education. So, why would you suddenly screw things up like that? And that doesn't include other things, such as tribal scholarships, which a white guy such as myself couldn't recieve anyway. Lets not forget that alot of land and money has been returned to Tribes, although some have refused to take it.",

I guess that's ok tho because YOU get to benefit from those things but when it affects your family THEN it's an issue. Do you know how many fucking men, women, children and elderly Natives died on the Trail of Tears? All because the government \"gave\" them a piece of land and then they Natives found gold on that land so the government then broke that treaty and made them walk across States and States to a more barren wasteland that had no natural resources.",

And with Trump as President it'll get even worse, he hates Natives more than he hates Mexicans because they compete with him in the casino business. He once called us \"All drug dealers\" that we were akin to the Italian Mafia. Probably why some of his first orders as President was to fuck over Native people trying to prevent an oil pipeline from going directly through their only water source where they get all their drinking, showering, fishing etc from  on the small chunk of land they were forced onto. Because oil means more to Trump then Native children having clean water to drink. Also he VOWED to changed a Mountains name that was OWNED AND THEN TAKEN FROM THROUGH BROKEN TREATIES BY THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT back to \"Mount McKinley\" because Obama in a sign of respect and wanting to work with the Tribe couldn't give them back ownership of the Mountain that is very sacred to that tribe so as a peace offering he changed the name BACK to the Mountains ORIGINAL name that it had for THOUSANDS of years before it was stolen and renamed Mount McKinley by the American Government. YUP THAT'S the most important thing to Trump a fucking Mountain that doesn't mean shit to anyone but that tribe but he's so spiteful and hates Natives so much (again because of casino competition) that's some REAL important shit Trump, you better get right on that. Got N Korea practicing how to blow us up, got ISIS signing up to be Uber drivers everywhere, got Putin and Trump measuring each others dick, Americans are racist as ever but sure let's make sure we change a stolen mountain BACK to the name the thieves gave the Mountain that's a TOP PRIORITY.  So sad to see all that my people had be destroyed and probably soon to be discarded after you raped it of it's resources just like you all discarded your original Countries. My tribe had 100% equality of the sexes, we respected the earth and it's animals (Go ask all the wild Bison.....oh that's right.... you can't because you fuckers killed 99.9% of them too) we didn't look down on gay or trans people in fact they were respected and called them \"two spirits\", women had an equal vote in the tribe and could hold council right alongside a man, own property (meanwhile white women didn't even have rights to their own children and a dead father could will his children away to strangers and the mother could do nothing) but suuuuuuure keep telling yourself that we were \"behind the time savages\" YOU DON\"T EVEN HAVE THE MORALS NOW THAT WE HAD THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO!!!! So what you brought technology and growth in different ways? You realize that could have been done along side the Natives right? White people like to pretend that we'd still be in the dark ages if they didn't come over and commit genocide, I don't think you have to rape 4 year olds and start a child sex ring like the whites immediately did (like immediately idk why child rape is their favorite and first priority) to invent fucking light  bulbs. Fact is everything you have was built off the death of the Natives and the sweat and back of the Blacks. I love how you push off the blame of genocide, slavery and racism but then take credit for all the things Americans have accomplished since coming here. Can't have both bitch. \n\"Dead skin, dead hair and the eyes of a dead pig. We brought them food and shelter they brought us an evil we have never known. I don't believe they are humans as we are humans, they can't be. They say WE aren't like them, that we aren't civilized, that they are humans too but if they are humans then I don't want to be a human. I thought they were my biggest fear, I thought the death, evil and sickness they bring was my biggest fear but more than that more than the devil himself, I fear we will become them.....demons in human form\" ---My great great Uncle Nelly\n\nBut I'm sure you don't give a fuck because fuck the people who took care of this land for thousands of years. So that it was nice and full of resources. What's your address btw? Apparently I'm American which means I can just take your home and stuff if I feel like it. Oh wait but then you'll suddenly care.... Maybe give me an address to one of your non white, non Christians neighbors? I wouldn't wanna upset YOU as you clearly don't give a shit about other peoples suffering, only your own.",

Looking at the US, but much, much moreso in south america (countries like Brazil have not too many white people, but these few are STILL oppressing natives and blacks like it was the 19th century). I would do it, if only I had more power. But I want to try to spread this conversation so people star thinking about it. Not necessarily a violent revolution, but just building a new government and society from scratch, and also (this is the most critical point) having advanced technology to defend against white people who will inevitably try to destroy these fledglings with violence, as they have always done (look at the Neo Incan State, etc.). Over time, these societies could grow and usurp the white ones that currently are in many locations. But if we look at modern day, there actually already are some arising new \"native\" bastions -- look at Bolivia, for example. Evo Morales. Looks to be a full blood native, and Bolivia is once again economically growing, and a new native culture is arising there. So yeah -- that general area would be a great place to start. Hopefully there are some rich natives that are passionate about this cause that are willing to do something around there.",

Also, the definition \"white\" in Mexico(like the vast majority of Latin America) has different meaning from the United States' version of their \"white race\" definition, with the US socially using the \"One-Drop Rule\" to determine someone's racial background or purity, while in Mexico or most of Latin America, Castizos(and Arabs too, I think) are sometimes¬†lumped into the same group as \"White\" Mexicans/Latinos.\n\nI disagree with the way the US or Western Media portrays all Latinos as \"brown\" but telenovelas also do absolutely no justice for Latinos in their portrayals¬†of them either(with nearly all the main characters always being white/criollo Latinos).",

If you look white, even if you're not 100% pure I'm pretty sure I myself am not, you should be put on the white category. Not even Spaniards or Italians, or Portuguese people are pure \"white\" they have Arab and North African blood in them because of the Moor Conquest. That \"one drop rule\" is lonnnggg gone now. People who aren't 100% pure white but look white can put down \"white\" in the US census",

Interestingly these aren't diseases which are indicative of  native born Africans. These diseases are due to the high level of stress and limited food sources slaves had to endure for hundreds of years so much so it changed their genetic make up.\n\nFurthermore the medication used to treat these disease only have a 70% efficacy rate on blacks who are descendants of slaves; whereas whites and native born Africans the meds are 90% effective.\n\nI think it's a safe bet that these diseases which are prevalent among Native and black Americans, are most likely attributed to the same historical set of events.",

But racial stereotypes about Native Americans are pervasive just like they are for other ethnic groups. You heard it from these Native American girls first! It IS offensive to wear a headdress for Halloween or any occasion. This past Halloween Spirit Halloween sold costumes marked \"Reservation Royalty.\" If people would stop buying these costumes, Spirit Halloween would stop selling them. \n\nAnd the team renaming itself so that they're not called the Washington Redskins would be nice. But football worship is at an all time high in this country. I mean it's the millenium. Come out of the dark ages!",

However, in Alaska at least, there are Native Hospitals where Native Alaskans of a certain percentage can receive free medical insurance through Medicaid from my research on gov websites. Secondly, there are schools like Fort Lewis College that offer free tuition to Native Americans and Alaskans. I agree that our country had treated Natives badly, I just have heard different things from native friends i have contradictory from this video. Thirdly, Natives aren't necessarily getting \"free\" government money. In the 1970s, there was a huge land settle my act that granted Alaska natives (and possibly Other natives) portions of land that was stolen from them and some of the land had valuable resources like oil. The natives in that tribe covering the land region then receive stocks from whatever industry is using parts of that land and have since created native corporations to manage the land.",

I am Inuit. We pay taxes. There are 6 Inuit regions across the circumpolar region of the world. I am part of the Inuvialuit region. We pay our taxes, which I would prefer over living on a reserve where PERHAPS you wouldn't have to pay taxes. (I don't actually know. I've never lived on one.) My understanding is that some reserves don't even have clean drinking water. Consider the following link: http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/manitoba/bad-water-third-world-conditions-on-first-nations-in-canada-1.3269500\nI think that the way in which the Inuit in the North have set up their agreements seem to be much more practical than that of the reserves, which are set up in the south. It's not working. The people are segregated from society.  They've really become easy targets for eugenicists to do their tests, experiments, etc. Anyhow, that's kind of beside the point.",

Let's trace back your history, shall we?\nEuropean history;\nIndo-European sub-species (White-man) found it's way out of the Caucus Mountains (Hence the name \"Caucasian,\") and was taught by the indigenous tribes of Eurasia (Europe/Asia). After being taught and accepted by other humans, the Caucasian man betrayed and conquered with tactics and tools given to them. Nothing but disease and havoc came from this sub-species. All your ancestors have done, is wonder around the world in numbers (Because we all know these regressive fucks reproduced quickly, yet they call other sub-species by the term \"Roach,\") and spread sexually transmitted diseases that arose only from your blood-type and regressed DNA. Your ancestors were so filthy, African tribes had to teach them how to bathe because they were covered in fecal matter. Laughable, isn't it? \nYour ancestors tried colonizing the Americas, which were already colonized by indigenous people who welcomed your ancestors. Your ancestors did nothing but steal food, hunting tactics which they failed at, and spread diseases that killed off large chunks of the indigenous population. Your ancestors had diseases that caused the skin of a man to fall off, head to toe, yet you ridicule the indigenous people for \"Scalping.\" \nGuess who they scalped? \nYour ancestors.",

It's not like I'm related to every white person.\nBut hey, if you're going to think of people as a collective then fine, white people are the best at war, adapting, and learning in general. You already said they didn't know how to do shit in the beginning but, they were taught and they perfected it. Tech in general would not be nearly this advanced without white people/civilizations. Look at Africa now, look at the Middle East now. These places are the most backwards and savage places on the planet.\nAlso, I'm only 4th generation in this country so no, my \"ancestors\" did not spread any diseases. Also, nobody knew anything about diseases and how they actually spread back in that time. How were they supposed to know they were carrying diseases the natives weren't resistant to? It's not like they just threw diseased people at them.\nAlso, I was making a joke. How the fuck can you find a joke that offensive? That shit happened hundreds of years ago. It's not like I look at an Indian person and say, \"Yeah that Indian man scalped my ancestors let's get him!\"  (as if I'm related to every white person) \nAlso, the white people that came to America didn't \"steal\" food. They hunted for it. (I bet there was one time that it happened and you're going to point it out. But guess what? Indians stole too.)\nAlso, \"regressed DNA\" wow.... sounds like someone thinks their superior, which is actually racist. If you're talking about neanderthal DNA that's a tiny chunk of the white population but it actually helps with cold resistance and resistance to diseases.\n\nBut I'll restate what I said in the beginning, who gives a shit about ancestors? Why would you judge someone for something that happened in their ancestry? That's backwards logic. Judge people based on merit today, it's not that hard.",

I don't mean those fake Natives with a great granny who was \"Cherokee\", I mean actual tribal Natives. \n\nSide note, according to census, more Natives preferred the term American Indian over Native American and those were mainly the full blood's who preferred the term but yes some don't like Indian. I guess it depends on where you are and who you're talking to.",

I know who my ancestors were. my indigenous ancestors had some of the first cultures on this continent and the depictions they made of themselves look exactly like the indigenous people of my country today, they look like all native Americans. blacks hair texture is only native to Africa and no where else on the world. native Americans have the complete polar opposite. blacks have nappy coiled hair that you can't even run your fingers through, native Americans have the softest smoothest straightest hair on the planet. complete opposites. you're a moron. you'll never be indigenous regardless of how many instagram posts convince you that you're native for having \"copper colored skin\" your ancestors came here on slave ships from Africa, and on the Mayflower from Europe. African Americans are a mix of African and European, it's extremely rare to find an African American even with 2% native American ancestry. but people from Latin America have anywhere from 12-100% native American ancestry. delusional",

The only possible way for the numbers to be over 30% is if you're including Latinos. There's no such thing as \"race\" so you can't be \"part native\" you are a descendant point blank.

You should check out Indian Country Media Network, it's like our newspaper but for all nations. Russell Means identified strictly as American Indian / Indian, he hated the term Native American (as do many Natives). It's offensive in some Latin American countries though but in Brazil they call themselves Indians from what I've seen. I guess it's because the Spanish made them ashamed to be \"Indians\" idk.

No one gives af about that ancient outdated superficial definition. There's dark Indians all over the US, there's light skin ones and there's pale ones. There's even Indians in Mexico that are darker than the average African American. Or should I point out the numerous human remains that have been found here that are over 12,000 & 13,000 years old and that their DNA / genetics match ours.

That's a fact. Your statement was blatantly racist. Do you like being part of the problem? Blaming white people for all the issues in your life? Well, that's the narrative that the Government wants you to feed into. It'd be nice if you could remove the blinders you have over your eyes and see who is really creating the division between race and color today, because it isn't white people like me.\n\nFYI, Christopher Columbus came from Spain. I have Irish and Italian in my heritage... guess which one of those in my heritage endured slavery, too... the Irish! Remember that next time you blame a white person for your issues. Every single race has endured slavery... if you're only denouncing the Mid-Atlantic Slave Trade, and not every incidence of slavery in this world, then maybe you should reconsider your views a little bit and denounce it all, like I do.

The number of deaths in that same period rose 5.8% to more than 2 million.¬†Previous studies¬†have shown that more white Americans, particularly middle-aged men, are dying from opioid abuse, suicide and problems associated with obesity in recent years. \nThe study mirrors projections by the U.S. Census Bureau that the country's white population will start to decline in absolute numbers by 2025. Minority populations, particularly Latinos, continue to grow thanks to higher fertility rates, and the Census¬†projects¬†that the U.S. will be majority-minority around the mid-2040s.\n\n‚ÄúThe future of the growth in this country has to do with racial minorities,‚Äù says William Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution. ‚ÄúIf we didn't have minorities in this country, we would be like Japan, which is very old and has a declining labor force and declining population.‚Äù\n\nThe move toward a majority-minority nation isn't likely to reverse itself, Johnson says, adding that several more states, including Vermont, South Carolina, Oregon and Tennessee, could soon see natural decreases in white population in the next few years.",

You say I can't tell her that her problems are small, but then you she says because I'm white I will never have problems as bad as her. I'm trying to teach people to get over themselves. Every time people fail a lot blame white people and racism, which causes more tension. Michael Jordan, Oprah, or Morgan Freeman didn't whine their way to the top. Neither should this girl with \"problems that hold her back\" (which they don't) and neither should I with my \"problems\". I listed my problems because even though they exist, I'm still successful, same thing with Obama, Shaq, and Denzil Washington. America is turning into a big cry and therapy session full of weak, spineless people.",

Much of it was most likely due to distance (in early fighting) and the fact the their was france , spain and uk all going at it also and during this they often equipped the natives to help them fight, well later on they had to then fight these now modern equipped peoples (not as well armed to be sure). But they did do the best in the colonial period that i know of. \nAs for the who owns it, sure you find me a living person that owned land ill concede it. Otherwise well the US was 90% white so ... Or where the American Indians came from was European and then moved into by Asians (the resulting peoples traveled to the new world, this is why pre-Columbus natives have a part of European DNA, largely Asian however). So i mean really their people first aggressed against us that we know of, so if you want to go down that rabbit hole we were just taking back land our peoples would have moved to (i understand that is a retarded argument, as is all you took our land arguments).\nWe can prove from the records we have new kingdom Egypt was inhabited by proto indoeuropeans (best DNA data we have, indicates Persians and Europeans are their closest ancestors). Should we forced those who live there now out (addmixture of largely arab and subsharans)?  \nAll of history is replete with this, its just ew know far more about what occurred more recently.  But if you are addressing morals, then its wrong or right no matter how long ago it is (by your argument) therefore, you must universally apply this. But you don't, you selectively and with bigotry apply this. Langucites at their finest.",

The natives in my bloodline could see the writing on the wall (or so I'd like to think).

We know for sure, via haploid grouping that the Native Americans were a protoasian/Caucasian mix (light on the  Caucasian). That moved from the west side of russia/asia over (how is debated) to the Americas. For a while scientist thought maybe both protoeuropeans and protoasians had independently immigrated to the Americans and interbreed their.  However, with findings of Caucasian remains on the west side of russia/asia rather early in human expansion timeline the theory hypothesis has shifted to it being one group of peoples who interbreed along their travels.  Despite this these people did have the subsequent evolution in asia/russia/europe and changed in the Americas under a different set of environmental pressures, subsequently making them distinct from their founding population.  This last point work like: if i took two groups of saxons who are closely related and put one in a forest on the equator and another in sibera. And put them in a condition of extreme survival of the fittest (low technology) . In a couple of thousands of years (maybe less, depending on the environmental pressure), i will have distinct populations, that can differ greatly in size, brain structure, color, etc.  This process is actually faster if you have a group that has a mid genetic heritage (ie not very related) as there is a greater amount of differing genes to better preform to different environments.",

The data indicate that the individual was closely related to present North American Native American populations. But, the DNA was ancestral to present-day South American and Central American Native American populations. The implication is that there was an early divergence between North American indigenous peoples and those of Central and South America. Hypotheses which posit that invasions subsequent to the Clovis culture overwhelmed or assimilated previous migrants into the Americas were ruled out.[58] After study, the remains were returned to Montana for burial by Native Americans.  Similarly, the skeleton of a teenage girl (named 'Naia' after a water nymph from Greek mythology) was found in 2007 in the underwater caves called sistema Sac Actun in Mexico's eastern Yucat√°n Peninsula. DNA was extracted and dated. The skeleton was found to be 13,000 years old, and it is considered the oldest genetically intact human skeleton ever found in the Americas. The DNA indicates she was from a lineage derived from Asian origins and also represented in the DNA of the modern native population.[59]\"\n---------------\nhttps://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/where-native-americans-come\n\n\"DNA from an ancient baby's skeleton shows that all Native Americans descend from a single gene pool. And their ancestral roots are in Asia, a new study finds.\"\n----------------------------\n\nAnd the haploid groups make them outside of Australian aborigines and more in line with the proto asians (proto southeast asians) and They are of Eurasian heritage. You grandmother just get her a dna test. Its possible for her to me mostly native but appear differently with just a bit of admixture.",

Well sprockets have to be a thing first, someone had to invent them, but some things are invented long before they are utilized (steam engine is as old a ancient Greece) or utilized for long times without much innovation (the wheel). But more importantly someone has to build a way to make them if they ever will see wide usage or improve them if they want to claim some special rights. Maybe first it starts off cutting a single one out from a piece of metal, so you have dozens of people in different towns. Then a few of these people, somewhere down the line, figures hey i can press these out, later stamp these out, and so on. After much physical and mental effort you a get a modern sprocket factory from this. If i spent the capital, time, resources, and so on to build this factory that makes sprockets so improved and distinct from the originals, what claim does one of those first people or dozen towns have on my factory? \nWhy do they, or their children, get to say i was one of the first peoples who ever made sprockets so your factory is mine (in part)? Why do they get to claim because they used the wheel, they own part of the profit for ultra light weight carbon wheels.\n\nTLDR- Europeans built America and the West. Sure they didn't make a new earth to build it on, nor did they reinvent the wheel for all the concepts that made the West. The improved old government and economic systems, in places others used to be (that they replaced). But the immigrants the come into the West didn't build the West. And they aren't helping continue it (You can look up the numbers most, as in over 50%, are a net drain on the system).\n\nSounds awful and its not their fault its the governments fault, but none of that changes reality.",

He didn't exactly invent the light bulb and he didn't even own the first patent for it yet he is known for inventing it how does that work.\"\nNo, absolutely not. Because we aren't concerned with who built the sprocket, just who built and runs the factory. Whoever invented the sprocket is long dead. Now if were were talking about a new specific design for a sprocket (chain saw or bike chain) then that is different, because you could show that you invested the time and effort into producing and developing such a product. Its also different if i was talking about a factory that had been making a certain wheel for 200 years, at this point anyone can make that same sprocket, because no one can show THEY made it anymore (they are all dead) and its uniqueness is no longer a thing as its design is common practice. In this case, anyone can make a similar sprocket, however, they cannot demand to do so with your factory as that is something that is still owned, unique, and a current product of your effort. \n \n\"Similar to how Columbus is credited with \"discovering\" America when no one could have since Natives were already there. \" \nSay he hadn't, say that the Americans existed in another dimension. The West and America wouldn't be there now. It was Europeans that made the West (they built and continue to run the factory). \n\" America existed long before the Europeans came they didn't make it because Natives already had a society and a way of doing things.\" The land, not the Technology, country, or structure. I didn't say the factory owners made their own land they built the factory on. \n\" Immigrants go to school yes? \" Its a bit more than that \n\"A well educated society leads to progress. \" Perhaps, so would sterilizing all low IQ individuals and forcing progeny of higher IQ individuals. So might banning frivolous entertainment and service industries?  Sad reality here is 10 more collective IQ points is worth far more than tons of money in schools systems. And as progress is your virtue i have to ask, at what cost?\n\"They also have to work for a living as well. This makes the labor force bigger and gets more done.\" In an increasingly automated society... we need more people who aren't worth minimum wage.. how do you figure? \n\n\" So again, why are people against immigrants.\" Because they are harmful to them. Its right in front of your face. Humans are greedy. They act on what each feels is beneficial. You do also, you told us yourself.  You want progress and getting more done is good. It is the people the West's fault in that they did not keep control of their governments, but don't twist that with the reality that the answer to your questions is that its the government that put people against immigrants.\n\nIf racist redneck bob could ban everyone, but Germans, from his store, then he doesn't have to care (at least no where to the same degree) if there are a bunch of Irish running around.\nIf the government didn't steal tons of money from Europeans (Asians too) for the benefit of other groups. Then increasing the numbers of people they have to forcibly provide for immigration is going to be taken hostilely. Saying i want more immigration in the West currently is no different than saying i want to take more money from you to give to people that will continually make the State and its people poorer. This is the cold hard reality of current majority of immigration to the West. Its a losing proposition. But not because of the immigrants.\nI could continue this, but again ill end with my personal feelings that immigration isn't bad, its that the State is doing bad things and immigration makes those bad things worse. \nSo the question is 'Why don't we stop those bad things' and my reply is, 'You don't see officers on the take, reporting their fellow officers on the take, but if you are a good officer you don't expect them too. You might still be able to have all officers bank accounts audited regularly. Even if its not ideal, you have to work with what you have.\"\nBut why be emotionally hostile to immigrants, because by they're natrue they have shown they are perfectly find by coming into a nation against your desire at your harm. The immigrants disregard the citizens feelings, so why should the citizens care about them? Furthermore, why don't you hold immigrants to the same standards?",

Europeans came here and wanted a share in our \"factory\" before they even put anything towards it. In fact, we the original creators gave them tools like helping them find food and survive the winter. Without that the Europeans would never have survived. According to what you said if we ran the factory why did they have a say in how it was to be structured. My people were forced from their lands without a choice which were then stolen from us by the Europeans. Now take our current immigrants. They come here to gain an education. What makes them worth less than minimum wage? Unfortunately, I think school cuts are the real problem for schools. In terms of immigrants schools get paid per student. Thus more money goes to schools. That isn't just good for immigrants it's good for students too. More money to schools means higher quality education and a more productive society. We may have lots of automation but nonetheless aren't we all working with that. All workers have to keep their skills sharp to keep up with the new technology. Eventually in the future we might reach total automation. Should that happen wouldn't your question apply to any average worker now?",

You can't condone that,  right?  Then our children were taken to boarding schools forcibly hair cut names taken and given \"Christian \" names and the actual beating of our heritage,  culture,  language and all that makes us human beat out of the children so jesus could be literally beat into them. Jesus never struck a person or child in order to make them believe in him being the son of God. But in his name 5 to 17 yr old kids were beat until they could be possibly saved from thier Indian-ness. Many family and friends in many tribes I know harbour a hate for Jesus because of this. The son of the living God! Was that ok?  When im called slurs or held down by white American college men and told im lucky they chose to fuck an Indian instead of killing one tonight,  was that sacrifice I gave to this country? Did I give my tears and ripping of my genitalia from the rape making this place great,  greatest in the world?  Cuz my dad's a cop, u should try to report this, that was what was said and truly go back to your reservation the cops tell me as a hate crime sexual crime is not reported but addressed as a compliant by a woman with said rapist having 2 friends watch not witnessing but insuring it was consensual. Not accessory to rape,  but proof no crime occurred,  is my very common rape and dismissal not a product of your said sacrifice that had to be made?  I am 1 of every 3 of 5 native women to be and who will be raped by a non native,  higher than the nation's average for any other race.  We must be the sacrifice? My family and their murders and their surviving through more than I will type,  this is ok with you?  I would fight for you and yours if I saw the same atrocities happen to you.  I would do anything to help. I would never call a country who ordered all of it great,  much less the greatest in the world. I would call it an abomination. Please,  don't say things you don't mean and if you truly mean what you said,  please next time you pray,  tell God you feel this way,  for it is written Acts 10-34 God is not partial but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to Him.",

Good one, we do all come from somewhere,  native tribes of north America come from the land of north America. Life started in Africa if you want to get technical so yes every one began there and from africa moved outward all over centuries inhabiting certain lands first.  North America is where my and many other people's tribes first inhabited, there for we were the native ppl or 1st ppl to be here and establish a way of life. Why must we be certain asain ppl? You are stuck on something that is not true, for some reason it's super important for you that my ppl be from Siberia and parts of Asia. Why?  Why you insist  on these untrue \"facts\"  much about a disproven theory that affects no one really in anyway,  it just seems like the more and more  common cry of non native ppl who don't want to be told to stop complaining about immigration when your English ancestors immigrated here illegally and then did bad things(to say the least) to the original ppl who already were here- type of cop out, resorting to saying but no... Native ppl are immigrated ppl from asia so that makes it of course not native ppls homeland that was stolen as well as the lessening of any guilt of what white ppls Engish ancestors did to us cuz 'we weren't from this country neither'. I've been hearing this allot latley when ever white ppl not being here first comes up latley in interviews and the news and the like when a white person is asked certain questions this whole \"well natives aren't native they are Asian\" thing comes up as a defence. I told you before reading your reply above I was done wasting time with replying to you since I have a life I need to live, but had to respond to this one of yours as it's ridiculous stuff you keep replying to me about.  But seriously,  you can't spend life on you tube waiting for reply after reply man,  I don't have enough time in the day to be on the internet for anything other than work,  replying back and forth to you is not on list of priorities so I say to you again,  i must go and you should spend a lil less time trolling around and go out side,  do something worth doing instead of trying to go round with me,  less screen time man,  go live your life and stop with this,  stick a fork in me man.

Just cuz u get food stamps or welfare does not mean u are better off. Food stamps and welfare are not handouts for soley black people. Anyone has a good chance at getting it but they are just too good for it and like to talk shit about other people even though white females lead in welfare and food stamps. And black people that do have it most likely still have to work their asses off and still live in the ghetto so what difference does it make. We have black scholarships made for us but white people think every black person gets a free scholarship. No, that's not how it works. First of all black scholarships are rare. And when u find one u still have to compete with other black people to get it. So 100 black people can apply for it but only 1 or 2 blacks will get it and the other 98 are stuck trying to find a scholarship. Even though minority scholarships exist white people are stastically way more likely to get more scholarships than minorties. Then affirmative action. That is barely exists. If it was a big part then most black people would not be poor. I got a 3.6-7 GPA and graduated with honors but affirmative action did not help me get in. Alot of whites are in charge of the schools and jobs. The only reason affirmative action exists in some places because whites in charge depending who they are can be biased. And if whites are biased then that holds people back from getting jobs because of their color which is why affirmative action exists. But like I said barely anyone gets affirmative action. I never seen anyone get affirmative action. And whites still lead in numbers at universitys so affirmative action is not stopping them from getting their education. This shit whites talk about literally barely any one effectively. Everyone for the most part food stamps or no food stamps has to work to be at the place they wanna be at. I hate when whites come at me like \"I am white and I had to work for everything I had\" im just like so nigga why are u telling me that. That shit is my pet peeve. I had to work too special snowflake so go sit down.",
