But I am so clever. I\u2019ve got so much to offer the world\u2019.', 'They are literally the worst.', 'Jeremy Corbyn has been criticised in the past for giving most top shadow cabinet positions to men.' 'Slamming her own party, the 35-year-old MP added women were entirely missing from Labour\u2019s industrial strategy because it was all about men with shovels.', 'Jess Phillips has become a leading figure in the fight against sexism in politics and society.', 'She regularly faces backlash for her efforts on social media, telling the festival that she has been victim to threats and abuse by dunder-heided Neanderthals on Twitter.', 'She also revealed that after her friend Jo Cox MP was murdered last year she reported all the death threats she received to West Midlands police, adding it was quite a lot.",

Post WW2 Labour demanded full employment and that meant over - manning in what became loss making state supported industries where manual labour was a premium. Wilson blathered about the 'white heat of technology' whilst quietly cancelling technological projects like rockets, missiles and computing because those sectors employed only a few people with brains not millions with shovels - to our dear cost today as we now have no sizable global electronics, computer or internet sectors. Labour governments then invested billions in ramping up coal and rail production because it soaked up manual labour and the result was the painful corrections under Thatcher as the make - work subsidy costs to the tax payer were crippling the economy. Now we have an economy better suited to brains than manual labour we can hopefully push forwards and let the manual labour party dwindle away.Its last bastions are Unite and the other public sector unions who still keep the public sector over - manned as their predecessors did for coal, rail etc.until they had succeeded in destroying those whole sectors.",
