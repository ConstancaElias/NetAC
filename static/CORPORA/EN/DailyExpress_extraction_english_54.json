Things like Terry Wogan hosting a beauty pageant, Benny Hill....the reaction was of disgust and disbelieve to unbelievable. Things have certainly changed, but may be going a little too far.I can well see a point were any comment or innuendo will be considered offensive with women winning the balance of judgment. Women network and people will be ostracized due to a overreaction to some comment or misunderstanding.Men have no course for redress and ignored sent to Coventry is the outcome....See more ",
