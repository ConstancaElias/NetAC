However environmental friendly the Aborigines were in the past, and other indigenous races elsewhere, \nTo return to their lifestyle is of course impossible and has been so for a long time.   Far too many of us for a start. \nThe 20th Century alone saw over a dozen wars that killed over a million people,  the worst being the Second World War. \nAnd there were at least 200 that killed thousands or hundreds of thousands of people.\nAnd the persecution of races by other people continues daily - the Palestinians by Israel, the Tibetans by the Chinese \nNative Indians in Brazil plus <b> racism </b>and intolerance even in developed countries like the USA.  And there is not \nA single thing that anyone can do about it.  All this talk about 'Saving the Planet'  is just that, talk and<b>  nothing</b> more. \nThe destruction of the huma<b> n rac</b>e is inevitable and has been so for a long time.  No amount of conferences and speeches can \nAlter this fundamental fact. \nIf White Australians are so concerned about the fate of the Aborigines, perhaps they could consider returning to the land \nOf their ancestors, whether in Britain, Europe Or elsewhere.  However, of course, this is also now totally impossible.\nAnd no White Australians can ever live the lifestyle of the Aborigines before whites arrived on the First Fleet at Botany Bay in 1788.",

On the European continent and experts in political intrigue the beautiful native peoples of the world simply had no means to cope with the level of violence and aggression from the Caucasians and its still the case today. Many in places like Uganda think the Caucasians are something akin to demigods and still do not approach them with caution personally I think the Australian Aboriginal situation is the perfect of example. Of why you should have the same level or superior violence to the Caucasians I wonder what quiet genocides the Caucasians are planning for the future? I'm having doubts these people are even human particularly reading some of the comments here. Perhaps the Sun cooking them to death is a good thing.",

            "commentText": "'That Aboriginal attitudes towards early white visitors could vary from tribal group to tribal group even within a small area was evidenced by the diverse treatment accorded to three separate groups of castaways from the \"Maria\". The men from the \"Maria's\" cutter were kIlled and eaten; those from a small raft were killed, but not eaten; while those who survived the ordeal on a larger raft were treated with extreme kindness, their Aboriginal rescuers weeping sorrowfully on bidding farewell to the castaways.\nFinally, what was the reason why, when the Aborigines had every justification, according to their own laws, for celebrating the killing of the early white invaders by eating their flesh, the number of white men eaten was exceedingly small in proportion to the total number killed, this being true even in areas where revenge cannibalism was the accepted practice? Alexander Kennedy ^o quoted Inspector Urquhart, of the Native Police, as stating that the Aborigines of the Palmer River area preferred the flesh of Chinese, hundreds of whom were killed when travelling to the goldfields in the Eighteen Seventies, to that of Europeans. Beardmore ^^ of Tiaro put this question to his Aboriginal shepherds. Their reply was \"too much salt, like it macon\". This was corroborated by Urquhart and Lumholtz *2 in North Queensland, and by Fraser *3 on the Mary River. Bates ^\"^ reported the same of the desert tribes of West AustraUa; it was the same with primitive races elsewhere ^5. They disliked the taste.'\n\nTo download this whole document , you need to go to the link and download it .\nhttps://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:242712",

            "commentText": "ABORIGINAL CANNIBALS.\nMothers Who Eat Their Babies.\n\nTo the Editor.\n\nSir - I have written many articles on aboriginal cannibalism during the years, since 1900, when in company with, and at the invitation of the R.C. Bishop of Perth (Dr. Gibney) and Dean Martelli, of Bunbury. I visited the Beagle Bay trappist Mission. At that mission the Acting Abbot (Father Nicholas de Emo) pointed out to us a <b> woman </b>who had recently killed and eaten her newly-born infant. When I asked her how she could kill and eat her baby, she replied, 'I only ate one' and pointing to another<b>  woman</b> she said, \"That jandu<b>  (woma</b>n) ate three.\" I still possess the photographs of the Beagle Bay Mission women taken by myself, and among these are not only the two above mentioned, but others who also killed and ate their babies.\n\nThe whole of the circumcised tribes, from Kimberley to Eucla, the Australian Bight, Ouldea, Tarcoola, and areas as far south as Ayers Rock, Mount Connor &c., were cannibals by rite, custom, and choice. I am making this statement \u2014 as I have made it unchallenged through the years\u2014from personal knowledge of the groups within the areas mentioned . I have explained in lectures and articles the various forms of cannibalism, &c , among the various groups. In steady, quiet, concentrated investigations extending over 27 years among the circumcised groups I have learncd the various group methods in respect of cannibalism. Some groups, as for instance, the kaalur wong-ga of a border area (South Australia-Western Australia) were cannibals by choice as well as by custom. They raided and killed, and then left their victim to be buried by his orher own group (who leave the camp of the dead immediately after burial). Returning to the spot they dug up and cooked their victim. Their \"special\" method consisted in cooking the victim in the position in which he was buried \u2014 legs pressed and tied to thighs, chin resting on knees, the fore and inner arms tied together, and the hands resting near the cheeks. I have buried many in this position, as this mode of burial has a wide radius. Scientists call it the' 'three-fold position.' For eight months I nursed and tended thr<b> ee bli</b<b> >nd </b>old aborigines, at my camp at Wirilya, some 20 miles north of Fowler's Bay\u2014 Jinjabula; the <b> last b</b<b> >lin</b>d old native of the one-time rather numerous group of Ooldea Water; Binilya, th<b> e last</b<b> > bl</b<b> >ind o</b>ld woman of the group, whose waters were along Tar'kula (Tarcoola) road, Yuria Water (45 miles: north-east from Fowler's Bay): and Dau'i, a<b>  dem</b>ented old man from War'darrgana,(the native name of Boundary Dam). Added to these was Jeerabuldara; a poor creature rotting away with disease whom I had known and tended at my Eucla camp, and who came to me over a distance of 240 miles, her relatives having abandoned her owing to her constant screams of agony. From all these I learned when and where they had eaten their last meal of \"human meat.\" I do not ask \"if they are cannibals.\" There is a local term in the vocabularies of all the circumcised groups for 'human meat,' and this term I quietly use when discussing the subject. Cannibalism automatically ceases on their entry into civilized areas, the instance of Nyan-ngauera killing and eating her newly-born infant within a mile of my Ooldea camp, being the only one. Her civilized women relatives had tried to dissuade her, and I had been at special pains to feed her and her family bountifully, so that hunger would not be the incentive to her horrible deed; but she did not want the baby in her new life. Every adult and boy and girl now wandering along and south of the East-West line has eaten human flesh. In the group of 26, including Nyan-ngauera, who came to my Ooldea camp in 1920, all, except the tiniest babies, had eaten human meat.\n\nThere was but one man named Nyeer-dainamong all these wandering derelicts (everyone of whom I knew personally) who told me he had never tasted human meat, and his statement was confirmed by Inya-gooj, whose mother had shared several of her cooked babies with him \"to make him strong.\"\n\nI do not like to cite particular cases; it does not seem to me to be playing the game with these dying people, whose utter need of such services as I have given them was first realized by me during my four months' stay at the Trappist Mission at Beagle Bay in 1900. In all, the years since then I have concentrated on this\none work of helping to make their passing easier.\n\nMy work is entirely \"hush-hush\" work, and no white person, fettler's wife, farmer's wife, or station owner's wife, has\n\nseen me at work among the sick or diseased friends round and about me; but I feel that this letter is necessary, as my personal integrity is questioned, and I hope its publication will do no injury to these poor derelicts among whom I have lived and laboured in this State since 1911.\n\n\u2014I am, Sir, &c.,\nDAISY M. BATES.\nNative Camp, near Ooldea, March 5,\n1928\n [LINK] ",

And I don't think any Australian Aboriginals who has grown up in modern civilised society would do this. \n\nHowever, cannibalism has been documented by many sources, to have been a reality in many if not most Australian Aboriginal tribes, before white man brought western civilisation to the continent.\n\nCannibalism was documented, as being part of burial rituals, and other religious rituals. Also, as part of a custom, or tradition(perhaps religious) of eating parts of the flesh of the tribe that lost in battle. \n\nUntil recently, there was an Australian Pygmy, which has disappeared. I sent a link above of how the Australian Pygmy became extinct. Long story short, it was because of war, and cannibalism as a consequence of war.\n\nThere is a good chance that all people would have done something like this at some stage in the distant past, who knows? This is why it's extremely valuable to study Australian Aborigines, so we can learn more about our own distant , ancient past, tens of thousands of years ago.\n\nHowever, because of the different environment Europeans grew and evolved to give birth to modern civilisation. All races have some advantages and weaknesses. In modern civilisation, built by white Europeans, it's natural that this environment would be most compatible to white Europeans. Just as the outback in Australia, is more compatible to Australian Aborigines.\n\nTrying to say that white invaded into Australia doesn't make sense, as each <b> black </b>tribe that stepped onto australia did the same.\n\nIf white people offer to share their inheritance (western civilisation) with Aborigines, and Aborigines spit in their face as they take advantage of all that they can .....this will not end well.",

                    "commentText": "'That Aboriginal attitudes towards early white visitors could vary from tribal group to tribal group even within a small area was evidenced by the diverse treatment accorded to three separate groups of castaways from the \"Maria\". The men from the \"Maria's\" cutter were kIlled and eaten; those from a small raft were killed, but not eaten; while those who survived the ordeal on a larger raft were treated with extreme kindness, their Aboriginal rescuers weeping sorrowfully on bidding farewell to the castaways.\nFinally, what was the reason why, when the Aborigines had every justification, according to their own laws, for celebrating the killing of the early white invaders by eating their flesh, the number of white men eaten was exceedingly small in proportion to the total number killed, this being true even in areas where revenge cannibalism was the accepted practice? Alexander Kennedy ^o quoted Inspector Urquhart, of the Native Police, as stating that the Aborigines of the Palmer River area preferred the flesh of Chinese, hundreds of whom were killed when travelling to the goldfields in the Eighteen Seventies, to that of Europeans. Beardmore ^^ of Tiaro put this question to his Aboriginal shepherds. Their reply was \"too much salt, like it macon\". This was corroborated by Urquhart and Lumholtz *2 in North Queensland, and by Fraser *3 on the Mary River. Bates ^\"^ reported the same of the desert tribes of West AustraUa; it was the same with primitive races elsewhere ^5. They disliked the taste.'\n\nTo download this whole document , you need to go to the link and download it .\nhttps://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:242712",

                    "commentText": "ABORIGINAL CANNIBALS.\nMothers Who Eat Their Babies.\n\nTo the Editor.\n\nSir - I have written many articles on aboriginal cannibalism during the years, since 1900, when in company with, and at the invitation of the R.C. Bishop of Perth (Dr. Gibney) and Dean Martelli, of Bunbury. I visited the Beagle Bay trappist Mission. At that mission the Acting Abbot (Father Nicholas de Emo) pointed out to us a <b> woman </b>who had recently killed and eaten her newly-born infant. When I asked her how she could kill and eat her baby, she replied, 'I only ate one' and pointing to another<b>  woman</b> she said, \"That jandu<b>  (woma</b>n) ate three.\" I still possess the photographs of the Beagle Bay Mission women taken by myself, and among these are not only the two above mentioned, but others who also killed and ate their babies.\n\nThe whole of the circumcised tribes, from Kimberley to Eucla, the Australian Bight, Ouldea, Tarcoola, and areas as far south as Ayers Rock, Mount Connor &c., were cannibals by rite, custom, and choice. I am making this statement \u2014 as I have made it unchallenged through the years\u2014from personal knowledge of the groups within the areas mentioned . I have explained in lectures and articles the various forms of cannibalism, &c , among the various groups. In steady, quiet, concentrated investigations extending over 27 years among the circumcised groups I have learncd the various group methods in respect of cannibalism. Some groups, as for instance, the kaalur wong-ga of a border area (South Australia-Western Australia) were cannibals by choice as well as by custom. They raided and killed, and then left their victim to be buried by his orher own group (who leave the camp of the dead immediately after burial). Returning to the spot they dug up and cooked their victim. Their \"special\" method consisted in cooking the victim in the position in which he was buried \u2014 legs pressed and tied to thighs, chin resting on knees, the fore and inner arms tied together, and the hands resting near the cheeks. I have buried many in this position, as this mode of burial has a wide radius. Scientists call it the' 'three-fold position.' For eight months I nursed and tended thr<b> ee bli</b<b> >nd </b>old aborigines, at my camp at Wirilya, some 20 miles north of Fowler's Bay\u2014 Jinjabula; the <b> last b</b<b> >lin</b>d old native of the one-time rather numerous group of Ooldea Water; Binilya, th<b> e last</b<b> > bl</b<b> >ind o</b>ld woman of the group, whose waters were along Tar'kula (Tarcoola) road, Yuria Water (45 miles: north-east from Fowler's Bay): and Dau'i, a<b>  dem</b>ented old man from War'darrgana,(the native name of Boundary Dam). Added to these was Jeerabuldara; a poor creature rotting away with disease whom I had known and tended at my Eucla camp, and who came to me over a distance of 240 miles, her relatives having abandoned her owing to her constant screams of agony. From all these I learned when and where they had eaten their last meal of \"human meat.\" I do not ask \"if they are cannibals.\" There is a local term in the vocabularies of all the circumcised groups for 'human meat,' and this term I quietly use when discussing the subject. Cannibalism automatically ceases on their entry into civilized areas, the instance of Nyan-ngauera killing and eating her newly-born infant within a mile of my Ooldea camp, being the only one. Her civilized women relatives had tried to dissuade her, and I had been at special pains to feed her and her family bountifully, so that hunger would not be the incentive to her horrible deed; but she did not want the baby in her new life. Every adult and boy and girl now wandering along and south of the East-West line has eaten human flesh. In the group of 26, including Nyan-ngauera, who came to my Ooldea camp in 1920, all, except the tiniest babies, had eaten human meat.\n\nThere was but one man named Nyeer-dainamong all these wandering derelicts (everyone of whom I knew personally) who told me he had never tasted human meat, and his statement was confirmed by Inya-gooj, whose mother had shared several of her cooked babies with him \"to make him strong.\"\n\nI do not like to cite particular cases; it does not seem to me to be playing the game with these dying people, whose utter need of such services as I have given them was first realized by me during my four months' stay at the Trappist Mission at Beagle Bay in 1900. In all, the years since then I have concentrated on this\none work of helping to make their passing easier.\n\nMy work is entirely \"hush-hush\" work, and no white person, fettler's wife, farmer's wife, or station owner's wife, has\n\nseen me at work among the sick or diseased friends round and about me; but I feel that this letter is necessary, as my personal integrity is questioned, and I hope its publication will do no injury to these poor derelicts among whom I have lived and laboured in this State since 1911.\n\n\u2014I am, Sir, &c.,\nDAISY M. BATES.\nNative Camp, near Ooldea, March 5,\n1928\n [LINK] ",

Rather than a story of aggressive white imperialists disrupting an arcadian Aboriginal people living in harmony with one another and their environment, the long term history of Australian habitation would have resembled more that of humanity at large where the stronger have pushed aside the weaker, irrespective of the colour of either side. Hence, instead of a simple moral tale of goodies and baddies, the history of this continent would have reflected more the hard reality of the human condition everywhere.'\n\n'This is why today the educated but non-specialist public has no inkling that there were ever pygmies in Australia. Knowledge of their existence would pose an obvious question mark over the central doctrine of Aboriginal politics. Hence, for public consumption, politics have made the topic taboo.'",

Only the psychopathic among us view it as ok, and they are a very small minority.  Unfortunately though a small minority, some of these have the most power and resources (banking systems and large corporations). \n\n Meanwhile, the psychopaths of other peoples are also committing wrongs towards others, but just on a less massive scale.

If psychopaths from other groups had the same degree of resources, power, and technology they likely would have done similar.  \n\n   But there is a problem with the western, caucasian culture in general that has become somewhat unique to this group.  That is hyper materialism and increasingly cutting themselves off from nature.  This weakens and imbalances humans.  Unfortunately, this belief system and way of life has been spreading around the globe from the west like a virus. \n\n    Which along with the psychopaths who have the most power, having concentrated and consolidated so much wealth, influence, and resources in the last couple centuries, is leading to a potentially very dark future for humanity.  \n\n    However, the Creator has very different plans for humanity, and plans to severely weaken the psychopaths influence and control on this planet and on humanity.  \n\n    This will be done primarily through a collapse, and people will have to get back to the land and to real community. Electricity and technology will become no more for a time, We will have to get past our silly separations and work together in harmony just to survive.  \n\n  In that, Love, harmony, and unity will start to grow and spread among humans. There will be other catalysts to go along with this near future collapse, but that is the main one.",

Almost all have mis-used that will at times to hurt others, and many eventually grow to become more loving over time and experience.  \n\n    Most Souls have had experiences in various different kinds of bodies, and that\u00b4s only speaking of humans. Truth is, many Souls have had experiences in bodies of other worlds and other peoples in other areas of the Universe.  \n\n     Caucasians didn\u00b4t originate nor solely own negativity.  It\u00b4s just that our culture has allowed psychopaths to take control. This happens because our culture has become too materialistic and too divorced from nature.  This weakens a peoples and allows the worst to rise to the top in power. \n\n  But slavery, conquest, and other evil things have take place among many different peoples and nations over time.  It\u00b4s more of a human issue than anything else.\n\n   Hate and intolerance will not help this world nor humanity to grow and evolve.  Love will though.  \n\n  Personally, I hope and pray that every Soul will grow up to choose the Creator\u00b4s ways of Love, of harmony, of Oneness yet celebrating our differences and uniqueness.   \n\n   I hope this bickering, broken human family can learn to love all its members.",

Rather than a story of aggressive white imperialists disrupting an arcadian Aboriginal people living in harmony with one another and their environment, the long term history of Australian habitation would have resembled more that of humanity at large where the stronger have pushed aside the weaker, irrespective of the colour of either side. Hence, instead of a simple moral tale of goodies and baddies, the history of this continent would have reflected more the hard reality of the human condition everywhere.'\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20040215000812/http://www.sydneyline.com/Pygmies%20Extinction.htm",

                    "commentText": "ABORIGINAL CANNIBALS.\nMothers Who Eat Their Babies.\n\nTo the Editor.\n\nSir - I have written many articles on aboriginal cannibalism during the years, since 1900, when in company with, and at the invitation of the R.C. Bishop of Perth (Dr. Gibney) and Dean Martelli, of Bunbury. I visited the Beagle Bay trappist Mission. At that mission the Acting Abbot (Father Nicholas de Emo) pointed out to us a <b> woman </b>who had recently killed and eaten her newly-born infant. When I asked her how she could kill and eat her baby, she replied, 'I only ate one' and pointing to another<b>  woman</b> she said, \"That jandu<b>  (woma</b>n) ate three.\" I still possess the photographs of the Beagle Bay Mission women taken by myself, and among these are not only the two above mentioned, but others who also killed and ate their babies.\n\nThe whole of the circumcised tribes, from Kimberley to Eucla, the Australian Bight, Ouldea, Tarcoola, and areas as far south as Ayers Rock, Mount Connor &c., were cannibals by rite, custom, and choice. I am making this statement \u2014 as I have made it unchallenged through the years\u2014from personal knowledge of the groups within the areas mentioned . I have explained in lectures and articles the various forms of cannibalism, &c , among the various groups. In steady, quiet, concentrated investigations extending over 27 years among the circumcised groups I have learncd the various group methods in respect of cannibalism. Some groups, as for instance, the kaalur wong-ga of a border area (South Australia-Western Australia) were cannibals by choice as well as by custom. They raided and killed, and then left their victim to be buried by his orher own group (who leave the camp of the dead immediately after burial). Returning to the spot they dug up and cooked their victim. Their \"special\" method consisted in cooking the victim in the position in which he was buried \u2014 legs pressed and tied to thighs, chin resting on knees, the fore and inner arms tied together, and the hands resting near the cheeks. I have buried many in this position, as this mode of burial has a wide radius. Scientists call it the' 'three-fold position.' For eight months I nursed and tended thr<b> ee bli</b<b> >nd </b>old aborigines, at my camp at Wirilya, some 20 miles north of Fowler's Bay\u2014 Jinjabula; the <b> last b</b<b> >lin</b>d old native of the one-time rather numerous group of Ooldea Water; Binilya, th<b> e last</b<b> > bl</b<b> >ind o</b>ld woman of the group, whose waters were along Tar'kula (Tarcoola) road, Yuria Water (45 miles: north-east from Fowler's Bay): and Dau'i, a<b>  dem</b>ented old man from War'darrgana,(the native name of Boundary Dam). Added to these was Jeerabuldara; a poor creature rotting away with disease whom I had known and tended at my Eucla camp, and who came to me over a distance of 240 miles, her relatives having abandoned her owing to her constant screams of agony. From all these I learned when and where they had eaten their last meal of \"human meat.\" I do not ask \"if they are cannibals.\" There is a local term in the vocabularies of all the circumcised groups for 'human meat,' and this term I quietly use when discussing the subject. Cannibalism automatically ceases on their entry into civilized areas, the instance of Nyan-ngauera killing and eating her newly-born infant within a mile of my Ooldea camp, being the only one. Her civilized women relatives had tried to dissuade her, and I had been at special pains to feed her and her family bountifully, so that hunger would not be the incentive to her horrible deed; but she did not want the baby in her new life. Every adult and boy and girl now wandering along and south of the East-West line has eaten human flesh. In the group of 26, including Nyan-ngauera, who came to my Ooldea camp in 1920, all, except the tiniest babies, had eaten human meat.\n\nThere was but one man named Nyeer-dainamong all these wandering derelicts (everyone of whom I knew personally) who told me he had never tasted human meat, and his statement was confirmed by Inya-gooj, whose mother had shared several of her cooked babies with him \"to make him strong.\"\n\nI do not like to cite particular cases; it does not seem to me to be playing the game with these dying people, whose utter need of such services as I have given them was first realized by me during my four months' stay at the Trappist Mission at Beagle Bay in 1900. In all, the years since then I have concentrated on this\none work of helping to make their passing easier.\n\nMy work is entirely \"hush-hush\" work, and no white person, fettler's wife, farmer's wife, or station owner's wife, has\n\nseen me at work among the sick or diseased friends round and about me; but I feel that this letter is necessary, as my personal integrity is questioned, and I hope its publication will do no injury to these poor derelicts among whom I have lived and laboured in this State since 1911.\n\n\u2014I am, Sir, &c.,\nDAISY M. BATES.\nNative Camp, near Ooldea, March 5,\n1928\n [LINK] ",

                    "commentText": "The RZ  Im proud to be born in Australia. My parents were proud to be born in Australia. My grandparents proud to be born in Australia. My great grandparents proud to born in Australia. My great great grand parents came to Australia. Am I not Australian mate? I was born naturally through love of parents native of Australia? If im not Australian than what am I? And how do you come to this conclusion ?  And what country which I was born did my family members build and fight for in all the wars weve been too, so peace would rain through out it ? So we could live together and celibrate together our freedom. Oh and I married a <b> black </b>girl. So my kids are mixed. You know half<b>  black</b> half white. So What country do they belong too? Im confused. Ive worked all my life and paid my taxes and am still working and paying my taxes contributing to my country well i think it is ? Ive never been on the dole and never asked for any handouts even when times were tough. And only been able to afford one meal a day.  So I know ive contributed to Australia and my country ? Well I was born here. What do you honestly recon ? And how does your contributions  compare to my contributions and sweat tears and blood I have spilt for my country or is it ? I dont wont a ps ing  match.  Just to let you know and other trully  indiginous peole know the injustices of the past which i ha<b> d nothin</b>g to do with nor my parents or any of my relatives had to  anything to do with how and why does that past have anything to do with me or my children? And why is it that white Australians are blamed for everything . Thankyou for your time and honesty and help in shareing your urnest and deepest thoughts my condolences to you any of your family that may have suffered. But this was not by the hands of my ancestors as my family tree shows we were nurses a<b> nd bla</b>ck smiths who helped our communities with no predjudice. Lastly I dont beleave colour should segregate us nor where you are born. These descions are not made by man. I never choose to be white and my wife did not choose to<b>  be bl</b>ack. These are simply the gifts of our mother and father. I hope that we can teach our children to treat and love each other as equals thats all. May your heart fill with mercy and your mind with peace. May you love yourself and treat others as you would like to be spoken too and treated. Kindest regards GC",
