        "postText": "University students housed in new pod-style accommodation have moved out after a month due to \u2018appalling\u2019 living conditions.', 'University of West England Students (UWE) described \u2018tiny\u2019 Purbeck Court Flats as shipping containers \u2018not fit for humans.\u2019', 'The 21 8\u00d710-ft en-suite \u2018studio pods\u2019 were installed in the Bristol university\u2019s car park last month, in response to an increased demand for student accommodation', 'First years living there claim they have been taunted by other students in nearby halls of residence for \u2018not living in real accommodation\u2019.', 'Joe Oakes-Monger told the BBC he had decided to move out because it was \u2018quite isolating\u2019 to live in \u2018a very confined space\u2019.', 'He said: \u2018It\u2019s a strange place to spend quite a large part of your time in. There\u2019s not really anywhere else to go.', '\u2018At the time [I moved in] I was desperate for accommodation, but I was pretty appalled. I couldn\u2019t quite believe the prospect of spending a year there.\u2019', 'He added that it was \u2018not an appropriate living standard for a human being\u2019.', 'Other complaints from students have include there being limited communal space, thin walls and being overlooked by an existing hall of residence.', 'The pods are costing residents \u00a3150 per week, whilst campus accommodation ranges from \u00a3111 to \u00a3183 per week.', 'Another student, Jack Fifield, said: \u2018They [the university] say it\u2019s a pilot scheme but they shouldn\u2019t be testing it on live students.', '\u2018They need to reduce the rent and retroactively refund them.\u2019', 'The university has said it will be evaluating the value for money of the new units.', 'It has plans to build a range of 2,000 additional student rooms on the campus, which will be ready by 2022.', 'A university spokesperson told the BBC the pods had been \u2018used successfully elsewhere, including student accommodation at other universities\u2019.', 'They added: \u2018We are working closely with the students living in this accommodation to respond to their feedback.', '\u2018This will be used to inform our future accommodation plans and to see whether the pilot may be extended beyond this academic year.\u2019', 'The university\u2019s vice chancellor, Steve West, has offered to meet with students living in the pods and said a new communal space will be added soon.",

Really nice to not have to deal with a roommate and they stuffed two of us into rooms not much bigger than that in a major PRIVATE university...where as an aside I lived for two years due to  FAR higher cost of housing with NO A/C in MIAMI!  Buildings were from the 1920s, larger dorms were mostly pretty horrid and OMG the bugs.  I'd be happy to live in one of those.  Easy  to clean and care for.  Privacy.  A window that actually opens (unlike some dorms).  Do they need to walk more than 1/4 mile to a library or group area?",
