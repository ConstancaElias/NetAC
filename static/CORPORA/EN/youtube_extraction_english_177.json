I also have fun making these videos and half of my content is satire and the other half is criticism so don't get offended at what I say, you only have yourself to blame for that. . . Generation Z is the current generation of the world. unlike millennials there are several characteristics that differentiate millennials from ZGens.. And Zgens are considered the 2nd worst generation in history. Why? because no matter how hard they try to be, nobody can top that fuck up generation known as the baby boomers. . . .

The mistakes that they did teaches them wisdom and when they get kids or grandkids, they will teach their mistakes to the younger generation to not make the same mistake and fuck up the whole newer generation that way we wont get a nickname for ourselves. Yet, you a 'Gen Z' is completely trashing our own generation that was meant to be better than our last generations, and you entirely ruin that by giving out reasons why Gen Z is bad, when it was not really the Gen Z's problem, but the generation before them. And to be completely honest, you yourself is ruining our own generation by making people think that this generation sucks. In which I can tell that \u2018That' was not your point.",

I know there are some <b> dumb,</b> uneducated,<b>  crazy</b> and whatnot people out there, but you, my dear, DEAR rude shait of a person are one of the worse cases.\nWe are all humans. Gen-Z is the first generation that was most fully born in the modern technologica<b> l ag</b>e. We were born when phones were already invented. \nWho were phones invented by? Baby Boomers! \nSo don't you dare tell me something so rude, SO INSULTING like this! Don't you dare tell me we're bad people, while YOUR generation made us like this! \nIf anything, YOUR generation is more at fault than ours! We didn't CHOOSE to come to life at th<b> is a</b>ge! On the other hand, You guys were the generation that MADE us like this! You're the generation who constantly criticize US for something YOU have caused! \nGenerations BEFORE Millenials and Gen-Z's has caused us to act like we do. \nIf not, then tell me why are most of us younger people unmotivated?? Because people like YOU make us feel like SHAITS!! That's why! \nI don't want to insult any older generations or any younger generations, unlike this guy. I don't care about what generation you're from, but when you go out and PURPOSELY insult any other human being, that's when you've crossed the line of being a dumbass, to being a literal scum of the earth. \nSo please, for the love of god, go back to playing games in your mom's basement, and shut your dirty ass of a mouth.",

People tell you to get off your phone even though it's a link to the entire god damn world, a tool. Gen Z grew up learning about the world by watching it tear itself to pieces. Gen Z witnessed hit pieces on pewdiepie and so many others, and learned to value critical thinking and facts. Gen Z is Left and Right, but I think in general we're pretty good at just being chill with each other's views, with the exception of an opinionated portion of us which is guaranteed to happen in any generation. Gen Z got fucked by some of the worst education our country has seen in awhile and we're still smart as shit, and on the rise to become excellent scholars. Gen Z has people that love all forms of music, and creates all new forms of it frequently. Limiting it to hip hop is an absurd generalization. Gen Z also parties, and drinks, and does lots of drugs, and spends money on material things. WHAT GENERATION DIDN'T DO THIS KIND OF SHIT WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG? Gen Z even speaks its own language- memes. Millennials are pretty good too, and don't get me started on boomer memes \ud83d\ude44. Gen Z has amazing athletes and shut-in programmers. Unapologetic weebs and Kpop fans. Chads and Eugene's. Gen Z will have to face the challenge of completely repairing the political institution of the US, and further prevent nuclear warfare. It's going to be an anxious couple of decades fellas, but I think we're equipped for the job.",

I'm actually okay with boomers they are a silly mixture of being relaxed about religion compared to the silent gen, And so not as materialistic as fucking gen x... They've had their hippy move in their teen years. Millennials... The most hopeless gen. Like myself, we think we are great we be all hippy and try shit like veganism and communism and find out their down sides the hard way. \nGen Z tho... Mentally whack from the dark side of tech.\nHowever... Gen A, I have no hope for them, that will be the generation to live under Internet Censorship, the start of the brave New world type shit. Gen B will be docile brainwashed airheads with no knowledge of the past or the truth. \nGen Z will be in tears missing the older times when things weren't ye all censored when their was still physicality to the world.",

We were born between 1995 and 2010, we're the first true 'digital natives', having spent our entire lives in the burgeoning presence of the internet and the mobile app store. No other generation knows how to communicate quite as well through images on social media or how to apply ad-blocking as fast and as furiously when disrupted by online advertising.  Gen Zers are, without themselves necessarily knowing it, throwbacks to a time in America that's almost ancient history. We share many of the same habits and qualities as the 'Greatest Generation.' Don't believe it? Have a look here and see for yourself. \n\nhttps://blog.2sparrows.org/2009/07/06/the-greatest-generation-tom-brokaw/ \n\nSurveys consistently indicate that today's young people embody 'old-timey' values like personal responsibility, a strong entrepreneurial work ethic, self-sufficiency, an intense preference of quality over quantity and an affable appreciation for spending time with friends and family.\n\nGen Z demonstrates the grit and resourcefulness of earlier generations far removed from them. While we didn't experience the Great Depression, we did watch our parents scrimp and save their way through the Great Recession of 2008, and we share an intrinsic desire for value.",

It really isn't a big deal, and I would say that most girls don't care. (Not to mention that trans girls are girls, not boys, so it's not a boy wanting to join. Though I think most girl scout groups would be fine with an actual boy joining too, so long as he's respectful) What makes you so uncomfortable with it?",

Autism is an actual thing and I have a brother with it, and it's difficult for the person who has it, and it takes a large toll on their family and is not something to make fun of. Personally, I love my brother, but living with very strict parents and being given harsh expectations, along with dealing with constant stress and anxiety has taken a large toll on my health both mentally, and emotionally. Before even saying that to try and insult people, do some actual research. Also, as you can obviously see, pretty much <b> nobody </b>likes this video, unless they're another jerk just like you.",

Go to a high school nowadays and you'll find that most kids who are technically \"hanging out\" with each other are looking down on social media and YouTube. When I walk into a school hallway that kids are hanging out just before school starts, I see that at least 80% of them are on phones.

While there is a huge dependence on technology, this is technically not a bad thing as we find continuously use the internet to fuel our curiosities. It has been easier than ever to learn a new skill. \n\nAlso, how can you be certain our jobs opportunities are scarce when the economical state of this country is better than it has been in a <b> crazy </b>long time and our unemployment rate hitting all time lows. \n\nHow did you make not going to college, but going straight into the workforce to receive and education and job training to avoid debt sound like a bad thing. I am in college right now, however I know plenty of others who opted out and are upward projecting in the workforce.\n\n\"Millennials on steroids\" ok, first off we're typically more conservative than millennials. Second off, you're still wrong about this entirely.\n\nI expect some shit like \"attention span is horrible because if YouTube\" and \"if technology crashed they wouldn't know what to do\".

Plus, the economy isn't really that much better. The unemployment rate is extremely unreliable for determining economic prosperity, and actual jobs are very difficult to find. Most jobs don't pay a living wage, and the ones that do have a very poor job outlook and require higher education, and try getting that without crippling student debt.",

They love believing that.  Especially the Baby Boomers.  \nMy father,  for example,  had little opinion of my generation until around the time the smart phone came out.  I was about mm,  seventeen when they rose into popularity.  We didn't create them.  Our parents gave them to us when they could have just said buy one yourself . \nI truly believe this generation gap is here to entertain people,  so that the older generations can always feel better about the ones that came after.  Even though they created that next generation.  It's so flawed and stupid.",
