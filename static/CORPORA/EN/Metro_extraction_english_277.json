        "postText": "So you\u2019ve got yourself an offensive friend: someone who thinks it\u2019s OK to say something racist, sexist or just plain wrong.', 'This is a tough one to tackle, because it\u2019s going to require either willful ignorance on your part or a bit of courage.', 'You can try to ignore what this person is saying for the sake of harmony and this will probably be your instinct, because we do all like to please people \u2013 and confrontation is hard.', 'My policy is that we can\u2019t let friends get away with saying offensive things because that\u2019s the most insidious way those sentiments become normalised and sneak into our everyday vernacular. We have to be vigilant about our integrity, even if it\u2019s at the pub or a BBQ.', 'Remember that saying: the standard you walk past is the standard you accept.', 'Be brave and set a higher standard of behaviour for the people you know.', 'If a friend or acquaintance of yours has said something undeniably racist, it\u2019s really important that you don\u2019t just let it go \u2013 more so if there is someone present who could be personally hurt by the comment.', 'Letting someone get away with a racist comment implies that it\u2019s OK they said it. Racism is never acceptable and we have to keep the people we associate with accountable for their words.', 'Tell your friend that you think they\u2019re being racist, say it offends you, say you wish they wouldn\u2019t speak like that. How else will this person ever know to stop, unless someone they care about pulls them up on it?', 'If this is a stupid acquaintance, you can afford to be straightforward about finding their comment offensive. If this is someone you cherish, such as a close friend, maybe start by making sure they understand the implications of what they\u2019ve said.', 'You may get caught in an argument if you speak up \u2013 racists don\u2019t tend to take kindly to being called out \u2013 in which case, calmly stand your ground. If you feel like you\u2019re in danger, remove yourself from the situation.', 'And if this sort of behaviour continues, have a pretty urgent think about whether you\u2019d like to have a racist friend.', 'The same rules apply here.', 'If someone you know has been openly sexist, call them out for it.', 'Perhaps they thought it was allowed because they felt it was funny. As their mate, you really need to make sure they know it\u2019s not OK.', 'If it\u2019s presented as a punch line, just point out that you don\u2019t find it amusing. Don\u2019t give them your laughter and if you can, explain why you\u2019re not laughing.', 'A powerful eye roll is a nice start, but saying out loud that you do not appreciate this kind of language is better.', 'If it\u2019s a straight-up insult, tell them that you don\u2019t want to be spoken to like that. However, the power dynamic can be a bit tricky if you\u2019re a woman trying to confront a man, so only speak up if you feel safe enough to do so.', 'It\u2019s especially important that other men point out that sexism isn\u2019t OK, because a lot of dudes rely on the complicity and support of their mates to get away with saying offensive things about women.', 'Same again: if you feel like it\u2019s possible, please, please speak up.', 'Every time someone gets away with a remark that offends the LGBTQ+ community, it only strengthens that person\u2019s resolve to keep saying things like that.', 'If this is a social situation and someone has said something nasty, even under the guise of a joke, don\u2019t let it go uncorrected.', 'Simply find a way to tell this person, whether it\u2019s one-to-one or in a group scenario, \u2018I find what you just said deeply inappropriate\u2019.', 'The best possible scenario is that you convert this homophobe into an ally.', 'Make them understand why it\u2019s cruel and unacceptable to speak about LGBTQ+ people dismissively, mockingly or ignorantly. If they\u2019re any good, this person will rethink their stance and learn to be better.', 'If your friend is regularly being offensive \u2013 or, to be honest, just says something particularly heinous one time \u2013 I would recommend that you think about why you want to keep them in your life.', 'The best friends are the ones who share our values, so if you\u2019re serious about integrity, kindness and tolerance, ask yourself whether this person belongs in your social circle.', 'If they routinely offend you or someone you care about, or simply say things you find abhorrent, then follow through on your intuition and stop spending time with them.', 'The more of yourself that you give to them, the more you\u2019re endorsing and enabling their bigotry.', 'Consider the company you keep, what it says about you and what kind of ally you\u2019d like to be.",

Jim Jefferies recently spoke about his realisation that a portion of his audience may not be laughing at his sexist jokes for the same reason he was- having found that female audience members were sometimes made to feel uncomfortable not by his jokes but by how uproariously some male audience members around them laughed anytime he made jokes about rape. His perspective was 'this is such an extreme thing to say that<b>  nobody</b> would take it seriously' but it turned out that some people were saying \"yes! somebody is finally telling it how it *really* is!\" What seemed absurd to him was actually the genuinely mentality of some people... who may well have left his shows with the impression that he essentially endorses their twisted views. He no longer makes those kinds of jokes and I've got a lot of respect for him for having that integrity.",

I personally can't so if one of my friends started making offensive comments I would likely conclude in absence of any good explanation from them that they're obv not the person I thought! There's one person I used to be cool with who clearly spent two much time in the grubbier areas of the internet who developed increasingly far right anti Semitic ideas... and would excitedly share them with me not realising I had Jewish family who were in concentration camps. Other friends of mine have had some disturbing things to say about women and the whole #meetoo thing which have resulted in immediate demotion from friend status...... the one thing I've never had the stones to do is actually call them on it! So they probably have no idea that their offensive comments are the reason so many people avoid them now- and that's on me and others for not letting them know.There's always a possibility that knowing the things they've been saying have lost them friends might be the thing that lets them know they're headed down a bad road. Unlikely but possible!",
