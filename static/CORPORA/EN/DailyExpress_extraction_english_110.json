It' s a question of slipping away.', 'I 've prepared the Booby [his wife, Jenny] for it. When I'm gone she knows exactly what to do and she 'll be fine.', 'John said he longs for a job and believes work is the most important thing.', 'I\u2019m pining, he said. The broken heart is for a lost job. Work comes first.', 'Put that in capital letters. I always worked. It's the most important thing in life.', 'John recently revealed he has been suffering for much of the year with a chest infection but doctors are unsure of the cause.', 'Earlier this month, John shocked viewers on Big Brother\u2019s Bit On The Side as he displayed a noticeably thinner frame.', 'After fans commented on his frail and gaunt appearance, John revealed he had been ill with the flu.', 'His representative told Express.co.uk: What started with flu in the New Year led to a serious chest infection, he is recovering well but slowly.', 'The star later appeared on This Morning to explain the reason for his new look.', 'John revealed his flu battle left him unable to speak for three months.', 'He spilled to hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: I'm getting better, slowly.I couldn\u2019t speak for about three months. ', 'It really was awful, you get weaker and you\u2019 re on antibiotics. ', 'The star also said he had been feeling depressed since losing his job six years ago as he said: I was over 19 stone, always remember you never see fat old men.', 'Ever since I was sacked in 2012 by Channel 4, when you stop working you feel depressed, you lose purpose in life.', 'He said to viewers: Don\u2019 t retire.'",

By all means enjoy your career to the full, but don 't make it the sole reason for your existence. Too many times I have seen ex - colleagues / friends pass away within months or a year after retirement, after declaring before they retire they 're going to do this, that, and the other when they retire,.....They never do! I always told them, if your not doing it now, for sure you won 't when you retire!........Not all of them mind you, but it is the exception that proves the rule,.......but 99% just fade away! Oh,.....And the other kicker is, they tend to get divorced, as the wife over the decades has developed her own routine! From my observations, it is the major cause of agro when hubby is now under her feet 7 / 24 cramping her style. Addendum: - The above should be a blueprint for all the Journo 's at the DE! Remember: -\"No One Is Indespensible', De Gaulle' said something along those lines!  Lol!",
