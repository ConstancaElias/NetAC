        "postText": "What I should say is that, dating as a black man often feels like you\u2019re playing up to a version of yourself. However, that would only be partly true, as creating any new relationship in a mostly white or non-black space feels like this.', 'There exists this standard of black masculinity that is idolised and fetishised by non-black people, where our blackness (or their perception of our blackness) takes priority over the substantial parts of our character. We black men are left to navigate around this standard and fit in when where we can.', 'I was unfortunately reminded of this quite recently while listening to an American podcast clip of two white women discussing the men they have f***ed in the past.', 'One of them bravely and unapologetically described the nature of a \u2018real black guy\u2019, using terms such as \u2018basketball player height\u2019 and a \u2018deep voice\u2019, and then went on to complain about how he \u2018didn\u2019t act black enough\u2019.', 'It was probably one of the most uncomfortable 1 minute and 7 seconds I have experienced in a while, yet I found myself listening to it again and again.', 'When I hear it from white people, I think \u2018what the hell do you know about blackness?!\u2019', 'Something about the sheer audacity and blatant dehumanisation was enticing, and almost too horrific to be true.', 'I couldn\u2019t help but imagine this clip, exactly in its current state, worked into a sequel of the mystery/thriller movie, Get Out.', 'If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the movie (spoiler alert!), the plot follows a black man who innocently and unassumingly meets his white girlfriend\u2019s family.', 'It becomes apparent that his girlfriend was actually targeting him (as she had done to at least 15 other black men), and that he was at the centre of a cult that collected, auctioned and took apart black bodies to be used by white people who wanted the \u2018more advantageous\u2019 black characteristics.', 'The movie\u2019s success came from its creation of a dramatic and theatrical storyline based on the real life experience of many black men.', 'It plays off this theme that the white people involved are doing the black people a favour by indoctrinating them into something bigger and better than them.', 'You would think this is far too much of an exaggeration, but when you\u2019ve had conversations with a white person, who rattles off a list of all the things they love about black people, you feel like they\u2019re trying to validate your blackness and you get it.', 'It\u2019s almost as if white people feel guilty that they get to be white and I have to be black, so they take on the noble role of reminding me that there are some benefits to my negroness by being my mate or wanting to have sex with me.', 'People often use the difference between racial tensions in the US and the UK as a way to belittle the experiences of black men in the UK or regard them as non-existent.', 'However, as a black man who grew up in an all-white area, I am all too familiar with being told that I don\u2019t act \u2018black enough\u2019, which is why hearing two white women talk about how they \u2018hate\u2019 black men who \u2018try to act like white people\u2019 hits home a little too hard.', 'Often, the standard for black behaviours in the UK is one that imitates London black culture. When you don\u2019t fit into that category, your blackness is questioned and sometimes dismissed, as if it\u2019s something that you can pick and choose when you want to be associated with.', 'I\u2019ve been called an \u2018oreo\u2019, which is supposed to describe how I\u2019m black on the outside and white on the inside. I\u2019ve been called \u2018the whitest black man I\u2019ve ever met\u2019. The list goes on.', 'It\u2019s annoying enough to get that from black people who exclude other black people in an attempt to create a standard of blackness for themselves (another argument for another time), but when I hear it from white people, I think \u2018what the hell do you know about blackness?!\u2019', 'Those phrases remind me of how white people see my blackness and it makes me sick. I\u2019m not an object or a toy for your white gaze, so don\u2019t play with me.",

I had 2 people yesterday tell me that they had been in situations where white people persistently asked them for drugs and couldn't begin to conceive the fact that neither drink smoke or do drugs. Purely because they were <b> black.</b> My partner was say \"fetishised\" when he first came to the UK Because \"everyone  wanted to bag the freshie\" (not my words) People make assumptions on how they think people should look behave and so on. My other half is Caribbean and doesn't like spicy food I'm white and i bloody love it. There are too many closed minded people that have preconceptions about different races. I don't agree with<b>  racism</b>. I don't think people should just pretend it doesn't happen. I do however think that there are cases where the prejudice is a two way street and not a one way. Granted it may be on a larger scale in favour of bigoted English people down to numbers. But hate breeds hate. I really wish people would stop passing their prejudices on to their offspring because children don't know any different and they are the future. Teach them hate and the cycle will continue. It saddens me that in this day an<b> d ag</b>e people aren't on an even keel. No one is better than anyone else. Well unless they are a murderer, mass murderer, rapist, paedophile <b> or terrori</b>st. Hopefully my comment makes sense and hopefully no one takes offence.",
