            "commentText": "I always find interesting how certain groups complaint about something that is normal to everyone and present it as a problem only for their particular group, presenting theories, and bringing new names and biased graphs that never consider all the facts and variables. \n\nThis involves everything from social issues as feminism, <b> black </b>lives matter, white supremacist; to politics like democrats, republicans, left, right; in religion, cristians, muslims, judaism. In this case<b>  ageism</b> is not a discrimination is something \"normal\" (in the real meaning of the words as th<b> e commo</b>n thing) Ask any person over 40 if it is as easy for them to get a job at the<b> ir a</b>ge as it was when they were 20. Look to any professional sport player, do they complain that after 30 they are considering to retire? (yeah i know some have gone al the way to 60-70 but we all agree they were not in the top list anymore) No because they understand their bodies can't keep up to the young new talents. Ask youself if you were a company owner, do you want to hire older or younger people? \n\nPlease I'm not saying older people suck, because they don't, older people with years of experience, knowledge and skill are a really valuable resource, just not in the places where the factor of being young is need. The only difference is people in hollywood or the top speakers of any particular group that comes with something like this have a \"Voice or platform\" because they are famous, or rich, or powerful or werever, people listen to them but ultimately they only care about their group, if they were really into \"This is a society issue that need to change it\", they will be in favor of all the groups and will recognize that there are many outside their circle who experience the same issues not only them, and they will work together to make a change for the benefit of all society not only their group.",

            "commentText": "My buddy does work in Hollywood and says there is indeed a pay gap between men/women.  But he says it's a #s game and due to the nature of men/women, rather than actual <b> sexism.</b>  This is how he explains it:\n\nEvery other girl<b> /woman</b> is into acting, broadway, plays, etc.  They have a dream of becoming a famous actress.  This i<b> s commo</b>n. They join drama in high school and take part in plays, go into drama in college, etc.  And after college, many move off to LA in hopes of being discovered.  \n\nGuys on the other hand are more rare.  Boys don't really grow up dreaming of being big-time actors for the most part, and of those that do, most of them a<b> re <b> g</b</b>>ay.  They don't go into drama unless they want to get beat up/teased by the other boys, they don't go into drama in college...or straight guys don't anyway.  And fewer men run off to LA with dreams of being the next big star.  \n\nSo, in Hollywood, you have far fewer male actors to choose from, and half of them<b>  ar<b> e</b</b>> gay.  In an actor, you generally want a guy who ca<b> n be</b> a sex symbol to some degree, because that brings in a female audience like no other.  So finding the right guy is going to be more difficult.  \n\nSo there is just less of a supply of quality male actors out there to fit the mold of what Hollywood is wanting, so when they find them, they are going to have to pay them more.  \n\nOn top of that, you have to consider that women will go out of their way to see a movie with a particular male lead, because<b>  a m</b>ale sex symbol has some of his appeal tied to his name and status.  Many women will watch a movie that they hate, just so they can see a Ryan Reynolds or Bradley Cooper.  So Hollywood will pay these guys high dollar to bring them in.  Men on the other hand place little of their attraction on status.  In general, men don't go out of their way to see a movie just for a female lead.  Any at<b> tracti</b>ve woman who can even act a little, will do as well as any other to attract a male audience.  And there are a lot of them available. The women who can attract a male audience purely by name, are rare, but those few who can, are paid an awful lot of money.",

I think the bigger question is, are writers creating roles (and producers paying for films to be made) where women have the opportunity to be the higher-paid lead?

I think that's the true \"front line\" of this struggle: we still have yet to figure out how to reliably create top-grossing films with female protagonists.",

It's not uncommon to see actors in their 40s playing opposite actresses in their 20s.\nPay gap's bullshit though. As you say, Jennifer Lawrence got paid $8 million more than Chris Pratt for \"Passengers.\" Where was the feminist outrage? The fact is she got paid more for the same reasons that she got paid less than her co-stars in other movies. As of right now, she's more bankable than Chris Pratt. It's the same reason that Jim Carrey was paid 140 times more than Jeff Daniels for the original<b>  \"Dum</b>b and Dumber.\" At that time, Carrey had just been in two big hits\u2014\"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\" and \"The Mask\"\u2014whereas Daniels was basically scraping by as a D list character actor.",

Their sheer luck of being attractive is a big part of what made them rich (not the only thing, usually, but for many, a big chunk of it), but when their looks begin to fade and they get replaced by hotter young chicks, suddenly they are furious about the shallowness of Hollywood. Well, what the fuck did you expect? You pushed out the older ladies when you were young, and now it's your turn to be replaced. Maybe become better actresses, like Meryl Streep who pretty much gets handed an Oscar every time she shows her face. Also, pick better roles; Sean Connery passed up being both Dumbledore AND Gandalf--no one's fault but his own that he didn't get a slice of those multi-billion dollar pies.",

However, this fellow student mentioned herself that 20th Century Fox considered Mulder the main character and saw Scully as his sidekick. She framed this in a way that it sounded like a mere disguise for the studio to hide their<b>  sexism</b>, and I believed her back then, chalking it up to \"anecdotal (not systematic\", but real examples of actua<b> l sexis</b>m in Hollywood\".\nBut actually, it's a perfectly legitimate point to say \"you're gonna get less because you are not the main character\". Duchovny always showed up first in the intro sequence, after all.\nConsidering how the show developed over the years, you could definitely argue that Scully totally was a main character. Andersson had good support for this claim since the show did continue with her and without Mulder for two seasons and it worked just fine. But then, the bottom line is arguing about relevance of a role and contribution of an actor or actress to a specific film, not about the<b> ir gend</b>er.",

Many women that complain about the pay gap in hollywood have a family member as their agent. So many differences. There are actors who literally have a \"10million minimum\" in order to even think about the movie. So producers start their bidding at higher than that. The backround is interesting too.",

When she started this \"Women paid less\" bullshit, it was for American Hustle, where her male costars got paid $100,000 more than she did. \n\nFirst, because they had more years acting that she had being alive. \n\nSecond, this was her first R-rated film. Yes, she was a big star for tweens, but going into a different genre of film, there was no guarantee that she would bring fans to the box office. \n\nThird, likely because the male co-stars negotiated for higher pay. \n\nForth, the union that actors are a part of generally requires a certain formula in how people are paid, based on a large variety of variables.\n\nJennifer Lawrence knows all of this, and saw an opportunity to bitch so she could make more money, and it worked. The fourth point does take media awareness into consideration, ie articles about you, appearances on news media. She found a cause she could support that would only benefit her, and get the support of so many others.",
