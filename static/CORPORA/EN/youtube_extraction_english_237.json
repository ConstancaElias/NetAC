Maybe I just have bad eyes but I can't see any difference between East Asia and European skin tones. The differences are facial features, not skin tone. I think in Spain we don't care so much about skin tone as in Northern Europe and East Asia, but if you are too pale people may say you look sickly.",

Also it is very well known that white people after the <b> age </b>of 25 and 30, especially the women, they go and appear to look like they are 45 or something, their skin quality turn real bad fast, it is also known that white people have bad odor problems, asians genetically have lesser sweat glands producing less body smell. so the stereotype that white people possesses all the good qualities are all false. Also in Japan there was or still is a trend of women going for a sun<b>  tan</b> darker skin, so the stereotype that all asian women want fairer white toned skin is false aswell.

My dad is a dark skin man, but he's someone that will make remarks about darker skin, especially women.

Even Europeans have a tough time in the US unless their English is impeccable. i guess that goes for everyone. \n\nwhen you're doing business to business work in the US, customers don't like listening to a fuckin' foreigner. I'm sure this is similar in a lot of countries, although Americans have an advantage b/c when we are doing business overseas, it's usually to a room amenable to English speaking business professionals.",

We understood we might have been asked to take pictures but middle aged men filming us without permission all the time made us feel uncomfortable. We tried to ask people to stop in Chinese and with basic signs but no one would. I drew the line when my friend felt ill and started to cry and a <b> woman </b>tried to take a picture with her baby with us after being told to stop-that's just cruel. I know this might not be for the whole of China but we went to Shanghai and felt very unwelcome. (This was in the school holidays so may be from tourists from smaller towns but I don't think this is an excuse, people in some parts of Europe rarely see Asian people but don't react like that and would be called<b>  racist</b> if they did)",

Opposites attract and difference is exciting<b> . Nothin</b>g wrong with that. When it comes down to it, attraction is not something you can control by political correctness. That's for you Asian Boss, you are seem unhappy with the fact that real Chinese are not affected by US style radical identitarian viewpoints. They are honest with themselves, we can learn from that. I respect these real Chinese people. Jamaicans and Africans and Asians want to bleach their skin, Europeans try <b> to t</b>an their skin, we all want to be different. Let us do as we wish without your judgement.",

To be able to get this perspective may seem simple but I believe this is very powerful content and we need more of this.  I always thought Chinese had better manners, so to hear a few folks perspective about whites being or having better manners got a laugh out of me.  While I'm sure that the white folks that live work in China are considerate as they should be I also know education and or good parenting drives good manners.  Rest assured, some whites In USA have deplorable manners.  Thanks again for great piece of work.",

            "commentText": "Let me tell you guys a few important and over-looked points (didn't even bother watching the end of the video tbh)\n1. Chinese people do not 'prefer' white people, people fall in love with people for many different reasons and the key actually is compatibility. I in-fact am a white person who grew up here in china, although I do get interests from girls from time to time but the MAJORITY would be too scared because of language barriers/culture differences. Once the language barrier goes, then goes the culture differences for me as I've grown up here too. HOWEVER it's a long haul because it gets explained every single time and Chinese people (girls) will get a lot of stigma from traditional people for dating a foreigner no matter who it is. On the other side of this, are the kind of girls that really are obsessed, have to speak english with you no matter how much it interferes with day to day life and are completely obsessed with the west and let me tell you they are the WORST kind of girlfriend a foreigner can actually have, they are full of prejudice and usually are having an identity crisis.\n2. This interview was done in a part of china that has the most foreigner influence of all cities... try doing this again in somewhere like Jiangxi or Fujian... LOL\n3. Someone mentioned below that Foreigners have a bad name in China due to the way they act, unfortunately this is true, Foreigners are on the whole, arrogant, unwilling to integrate and generally complain and look down upon the local people and have a lot of social drama. It's the few spoiling it for the many but if you are looking to come to China to work, teach, visit, whatever... remember you are the ambassador of where you are from no matter how tempting it is to slip up or just use being foreign as an excuse. Try find a decent job, and if you settle for a more undesirable job, do it to the best of your ability.",

For example, in Canada asians broadly are treated very well in reference to getting jobs. Its interesting to see that the reverse might be true in China, as for the racial partner preference its also<b>  weird</b>, because alot of White guys (from the perspective of a white guy) prefer asian girls, where as Asian guys prefer asian girls mostly. At the higher echelons of ever<b> y rac</b>e there are undoubtable beauties. Also regarding the academic question, in Canada asians are pretty well known to to better at math and science, where white people tend to lean on philosophy, psychology, and history. I think in general asian people are more reserved, passive and quiet, and white people are more outspoken and brash, but in the end these are just stereotypes mixed with anecdotal evidence of my own, so take it for what its worth.",

I might be living and working there for up to a year, and am just trying to get a feel for how people there look at things, and this makes me feel a bit more comfortable.  I don't mind being \"the minority\" and find it exciting as well, but am also a little apprehensive for being so for the first time in my life.\n\nAlso, it's interesting how some over there are trying to lighten their skin, while I'm spending two hours a day tanning while out jogging and walking. Ha.\n\nAnyway, I'm looking forward to meeting and getting along with everyone there.  I'm learning all I can, and am just excited as all get out about experiencing a new culture.  If I get the job, I won't be very far from Shanghai.",

It is was truly impossible to find any job without Chinese knowledge, regardless of how hard I have tried.  \nWhite skin: I really don't agree with the Chinese traditional consideration of white skin is more beautiful. My GF, and also other Chinese girls, are definitely more beautiful when they have dark(er) skin.  For me! However, protecting the skin from the sun is healthy as the ozone layer is already quite <b> thin.</b>\nChinese girls like a white man: I haven't noticed that. Maybe sometimes I have seen 1-1 girl,  but there is no significant difference than in other parts of the world.  Cheers,",

Even<b>  old</b> french culture has similar perceptions. It's not about just looking \"white\", but more like fair-tone, subtle looking skin. Well, nowadays it's the opposite.

Well at least for the Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Philippino and Vietnamese videos that I have watched.  Not sure about the less popular countries in asia.  Serious inferior complex issues. I knew I knew it. \n\n   Whites mock and stereotype them constantly yet they still continue to worship them?? I guess as long as they get that white approval they will continue to do so. The only thing is that won't ever happen. Only if the white person is a koreaboo, weeaboo, anime/manga otaku, gamer or has an extreme asian fetish... Aka lots of white men lol. Regular white people( the ones they worship)  could care less about them. Its actually kinda sad..... kinda. \ud83d\ude0f\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude04",

            "commentText": "The problem is how things are presented to students. For example its one thing to expose them to Western culture so that they may have some understanding of the outside world since Chinese society tends to be homogeneous (most people do not encounter other races or <b> ethnic </b>minorities on a daily basis), but its another thing to present these things in a way that paints other cultures as being better or something to aspire to. For example the girl who said having a white person represent a company is accepted by many as improving a company's image because this is a traditional mindset. What? Lol a traditional mindset would be something like respect for the family ancestral line or the honoring of ancestors through food offerings and prayer. She even used the word \u50b3\u7d71 to describe it. How can worshipping white people be traditional when white people barely got on the scene? Either that girl has no idea what \u50b3\u7d71 means or she doesnt know traditions because the traditional culture has been lost. If you interviewed real Chinese people meaning ones that know the actual culture and dont just look Chinese on the outside, this video would be a LOT different. Also Chinese can have skin lighter than white people and darker than white people. The preference for light skin stems from farm workers being outside traditionally and thus tanning and having darker skin, whereas lighter skinned people did not do manual labor and could be inside. It has<b>  nothing</b> to do with so-called white people such as Europeans but many of them like to think that way to make themselves feel better. Another way in which white people bend the truth to make themselves feel superior. I guess they have to do that because fantasy is all they have. But whats new",

In ancient China, people thought that lighter skin colour shows a higher social class, cuz they wouldn't work as farmers or be working-class people. And most Chinese people around me tend to think that lighter skin is just prettier, regardless of social classes or status. And also when it comes to thoughts that white people are more good looking, it really depends on the individual experiences. Most people haven't actually met or seen many ordinary people from outside the country, and therefore they are easily influenced by celebrity images. It can also be interpreted as people want what they don't have. To be frank, I, as an asian Chinese, don't really think that white people are prettier, and I really don't understand the way they understand 'white', cuz people from different area do look differently, even they are all called white people.",

You can make fun of this too but even us whites showed class by choosing whiter partner. I'm lucky I'm white because I embrace it. But I know so many people want to be such and they are honest. Some people even latinos in Colombia for example who are darker might not like me because I'm white and very tall. Some people love it. So, it is how you'd react to that! These topics will be here till we exist on this earth. Don't be bothered by the truth. Read and educate yourself and be open to understand. It's difficult for me to explain how we become something we hadn't a choice over! It's probably gods gift or nature. You can't choose your parents that's why you shouldn't blame them nor me. We always ask for others people opinion even if we didn't need it. We are curious creatures !",

I get that \"oh my god, anything i say is going to sound completely stupid\" feeling,  like im just gonna stand here and stare at the floor and hope no one asks me anything. It seems to me that most people being interviewed in videos like these on youtube, are rather nice and polite, id love to interact with people like that, if i can get past the \"i feel so <b> dumb\"</b> stage.  I love the culture because its very traditional yet extremely modern, so its very interesting to me to see the balance as well as it appears to be.  Love the videos my friends.",

And don't forget that Europeans are far less numerous then Asians, and still things like: computers, electricity, cars, planes, telephones, democracy, philosophy etc. Were invented by whites not Asians.\n\nChina got invaded multiple times by countries much smaller in population and size.

In Europe, being submitted to better education, will have a much higher iq. Currently, th<b> e africa</b>n population in Europe is at 2.5%. But by your logic, this lowers the overall iq from 103 down to 99. Bear in mind, there are also a sizeable population of east asians residing in Europe (iq between 105 - 108) which would be increasing the iq. A good example of a European country which is predominantly 'caucasian' is Iceland, which has an average iq of 101, still considerably less than East asian countries. As for the inventions, well done. I take my hat off, but that doesn't take away the fact that caucasians are still about 5+ iq points lower east asians.",

Im a white man from Sweden and i,ve always prefered Asian women but to be honest most people are not interested in mixing races but i,ve got a few friends who rather look for an Asian women to start a family with. Its not easy to find them even though we have plenty here since Asian people usually hang in their own circles. Everyone is beautiful to someone but most importantly you gotta love yourself first and thats not an easy task. And if any Asian guy reads this, there are plenty of white girls who like Asian guys all you have to do is to get some confidence cause from my experience asian guys seem to believe white chicks dont want them but there is plenty of white women who would love a confident Azn dude, i,ve known plenty of beautiful Swedish girls who would SMASH ;) <3",

In life you have to just be happy with who you are.  Females who liked tall Asian guys with sharp facial features liked me, people who didn't like my look, didn't like me.  So be it.  You can't please everyone.  In the end it doesn't matter because you only need your last significant other to like you.  Also, you are forgetting that \"looks\" are only one aspect.

I have almond-shaped eyes just like most Asians, and even though I'm quite tall, often have 5 o'clock shadow, and have a large Adam's <b> Apple,</b> I've had cases where Caucasian males chase after me across the room only to have me give them a look of \"why the heck are you chasing me\" then they realize I'm a man.  I don't have any other aspect that is feminine except my almond-shaped eyes and \"fair\" skin and perhaps<b>  thin</b> build.  Btw, I hav<b> e nothin</b>g against the individuals who get turned on by almond-shaped \"feminine\" eyes.  It's not their fault.  They've been taught by media that almond-shaped eyes = feminine.",

Plus Asians born in Asia have a different priority system and usually care more about intelligence, loyalty, devotion, compatibility, family, etc than physical appearance when choosing partners.  People from western society tend to place a higher importance to physical appearance when choosing partners.  This is why it's very conflicting for Asians who are born in western society.  Basically, ABCs, ABJs, ABKs, CBCs, CBJs, CBKs, etc. have to strike a balance. Need to not only get good grades, go to a good college, get a good job, but also play sports, work out with weights, eat healthy western food like beef and milk to grow tall, and grow facial hair, etc.",

I hardly see any dark skinned actors or actress on TV in India, the Philippines or Malaysia where most people have dark skin.  Thailand too.  Korea is the leader in cosmetic surgery operations and skin whitening products.  It is too bad, people are brainwashed by the white-trash mentality.  That is the reason Asians still cannot form its own alliance or free trade agreement among Asian countries like the North America's Free trade or the organization like NATO.  Asians are not working together but they often working against each other among themselves for the West leading by the US to take advantage of.  Asians rather have the control by the control <b> freak </b>US than work together with China for<b>  common</b> goals to make Asia a more peaceful, more stable, and more prosper place for all Asians to enjoy.  Rising China has made positive contribution to all of Asia.  But other Asian countries see that as threat to them.  How come they never complain about the control over them by the US who is the most powerful and contro<b> l frea</b>k in the world?  How can China control them more than the US?  How much the US has benefited Asian countries economically and politically?  You don't have to look further,.  Just look countries that are allies to the US, have their countries do better or worse?  The Philippines is a good example that it has been the ally of US for long time, but it is still one of the poorest and most corrupted country in Asia if not in the world.  By the way, Philippine has been doing well for a country after having good term with China.  Singapore is a good example of country that don't listen or controlled by the US blindly and doing exceptionally well.  In fact, Singapore is the best in Asia in many aspect.  Again, Singapore has a balanced relationship between China and the US.",

I was born and raised in Kenya and now live in the U.S, my friends from Kenya don't get white standards of beauty. Prior to being exposed to what the western world found beautiful, many holly wood actresses were honestly very unattractive to me, I just didn't get why they were found beautiful. On that note, I notice white women in Kenya often go for Maasai and Samburu men and I realized it's because they fit the western standard of beauty. Slim, tall, high cheek bones, etc. I notice though East Asia and the West seem to heavily focus on features and the form of the body in a way we don't. Heck, the Belgians literally enforced a hierarchy in Rwanda based on the tribe that was more \"caucasian\" looking... I also find that what East Asians find to be beautiful among their own might not even get a glance from the average person in the West. I for instance do not get the appeal of many Asian idols but there are millions of women screaming about how attractive they are. From all the colonial literature, white people are just described as sick looking.",

But, even though the history says that, pale equals rich and dark equals poor. Asian people still have a color complex and superiority complex. This doesn't count for the entire <b> race </b>but, most of them do feel this way. People can say what they want, if I and my family went to China right now, my husband who is white and my kids because they have fair skin and white hair, would automatically be considered as Superior. But me, because I'm<b>  black</b> with dark beige skin o<b> r ta</b>n, whatever you want to call it. I would be considered unattractive, dangerous and, possibly poor because I'm darker than my family. Asian people have worshipped and put white people on a pedal stool for decades and centuries now. Like I said before, not the enti<b> re ra</b>ce feels this way, but most of them have and still do. And the reason why they do this is because, most of them learn what they see on television and a base people off what they see on mainstream and not to mention, most jobs and companies are owned and ran by white people. So, they'll assume that \"white is right\" and they don't even like themselves so which means, they don't like anybody else. I think most of these people hav<b> e a men</b>tal issue and self-hate for themselves and others and, it needs to be corrected with communication, education and self-help. Because, it will never get better and it will never change, if they don't. To look at yourself and others and feel that, you're inferior and someone else is Superior; <b> is a me</b>ntal problem. I think Asian people and anyone else incl<b> uding </b>black people, can be beautiful and good and, I don't think you have to be white to be polite and kind.

But some may feel sad because they was born to look a certain way and would rather want the features that others have. It's not a bad thing but it's also not a good thing either. When choosing a love partner though having a preference for particular features is a good thing though but just as long as your not being a jerk towards or bashing anyone else just because their preferences are different or whatever else. However you yourself are born into this world with your appearance choosing you and not you choosing your appearance but this could change in the future with technology getting more and more sophisticated and because of genetic engineering. I am definitely against plastic surgery and all that fake rubbish aswell anyway.",

For example, when they suggest that the general perception is that they are educated and ambitious, I am slightly concerned. I think they came to this conclusion because most whites in China are probably educated enough to value its culture, and any English speaker who decides to learn Mandarin is likely to be \"ambitious\" in many ways because it is a VERY difficult language to learn as an English speaker. Basically, only the the ambitious and/or educated ones will actually make it out to China. I see plenty of uneducated slobs here in the US. Here, it is the opposite: it is generally though that Chinese are much more industrious. I haven't visited China so I can't say if that's true or not.",

            "commentText": "As a white guy who often goes to the PRC (with a really <b> weird </b>situation, I am an ROC, ie Taiwan passport holder but not of Chinese origin) I would say a few things. 1) This was done in Shanghai. Probably the most open city and most receptive to foreigners in mainland China (only HK or ShenZhen can compare). 2) I found a strange situation that even though I am a Taiwan passport holder and lived here longer than anywhere else, I found as a white guy in Taiwan I face some idiotic ideas (you can't survive in your \"own country\"...). In PRC I found the workers and customers were more OK with respecting the knowledge I had about technical aspects of work than in Taiwan. The Chinese Taiwanese I met there were really friendly to me as soon as they heard me talk, because they noticed my accent etc and straight away knew from my talking what accent that was but if you are a non-Chinese<b>  immigrant</b> (some of who were already here several generations because of those who came in 1949 from mainland China but were not Han Chinese...) or Aboriginal Taiwan citizen here in Taiwan you will face some bad attitudes here in Taiwan. On the other hand it it is really frustrating in PRC when we (the 5% or so of ROC, ie Taiwan people) who are not ethnically Chinese people can't believe we exist, say some BS like \"this can't be real, you are not Chinese and all Taiwanese are Chinese\". I often went to ShenZhen and DongGuan. For me one thing great about there is so many people are not from there so they easily understand what it is like to be an outsider. I know many people who go to BeiJing and some other places have a more negative view.",

The funny thing about a pale skin preference as a sign of class (not working under the sun) is that in the West being super pale is seen as being 'low class' because you're perceived as either a basement dweller or chained to a cubicle to the point where you don't have access to the sun. Though I think in the West a better known indicator of class is how rough a person's hands are, indicating manual labour. \n\nHow are foreigners treated in Canada? I think it's best to ask them how they feel they're received. I can say this though, no one is likely to point at a Chinese person walking down the street and say 'look a foreigner!' because I think the default assumption given our multicultural society is that they're probably not foreign. I mean 1.5 million Chinese Canadians live in Canada, so why would you want to alienate your neighbour?",

Either it was a monarchy or dictator ship but all of them had their nobles, and nobles don't work. Since work was majority done in the farms and fields people would get tanner from doing such works. So nobles had a fair skin compared to the ones who worked. Since humans are incredibly driven by aesthetics and looks this became a norm, to the point the nobles would paint themselves with rice powder.\nThis skin distinction wasn't so pronounced in Europe because the sun doesn't shine so bright in those latitudes and the place is cold, so even under the sun you'll be wearing clothes to protect your skin. In fact, rich people nowadays are inverted in such sense in American and European cultures. They have a lot of time to travel so they are constantly tanned and people that work a lot have lighter skin because they spend their time working inside buildings who don't happen to <b> tan </b>their skin!",

Also for the guy who said that \"whites have better features and we just have to admit that.\" seriously feel sorry for his children because he is going he is going to teach them that hate themselves as soon as they can start to understand. That is just a really sad way of thinking man. every individual has negatives and positives to their features depending on who's looking at them. Like some Asians have surgery to widen their eyes and I think that that's what makes them special because they have the slanted eyes or  some people say that they hate their big lips and then other people have kiss someone with big lips and become addicted. Really  we're all one big hodge-podge of DNA, recessive and dominant genes that's it.",

Qatar is the richest country in the world; does that prove Qataris are the smartest <b> nationality </b>and that Qatar is the most successful society in the world? How about evaluating societies by taking into consideration the entire historical and geopolitical context, such as unequal competitive advantages such as rich oil deposits or a legacy of reaping the benefits of colonialism for centuries? Not to mention climate (Europe enjoys a temperate climate of mild temperatures, low humidity, reliable but not overbearing rainfall, no monsoons/tsunamis, no hurricanes, limited earthquake-prone fault lines, few wildfires due to drought, etc.), while Asians have historically faced much harsher climactic conditions (extreme heat and cold, high humidity, torrential downpours, monsoons and tsunamis, hurricanes, massive earthquakes due to being situated on the Ring of Fire). When putting different races in the same conditions, Asians in Western countries typically outperform white people, while white people in Asia aren't necessarily more successful than the local Asians.",

The Chinese would never put up with the hate whites receive from so called progressive organisations and minority groups who want to be the majority. The Chinese will never allow mass immigration into their country. Good for them. China for the Chinese. Europe for Europeans.",

As much as he accomplished, he has failed to make young Chinese proud of their culture and heritage.",

I use to live in Foshan, and I never felt so comfortable, safe and welcomed. To me, it does not really matter if Chinese look whiter or darker, their skin does not determine the traits of their character.  There are many ugly shrubs, which produce much <b> fruit,</b> while there also lovely looking trees that lack a produce in the time of harvest. It is the inside that counts. Many of the products that these ladies use to whiten their skin can also cause cancer, a risk not worth taking. Be yourself, what you are and natural, not what other people think you should be.",

China's admiration of whiter skin color is not at all coming from white people per se, but rather it's because in the <b> old </b>times, if you work on a outdoor job, like farming, you are much more likely to be exposed under the sun extensively resulting in darker skin,whereas  if you come from a more well off family, you mostly work indoor and less likely to have darker skin. People usually perceive each other through the darkness of the skin to determine their social class. There's tons of ancient literature to prove this,<b>  nothing</b> to do with the white guys.",

Also there's limit to everything. Even if white skin is preferred in general, there is a level for it and anything whiter than that starts to look unappealing.

And for thousands of years only wealthy people who don't work outside are capable to keep their skin fairly, and normally a wealthy guy would be able to find a good looking wife and they received more education which made them look graceful. Therefore, when fair skin often combines with pretty face and graceful manners, after thousands of years, it became part of the traditional beautiful standard. But I personally think as long as the skin is smooth and healthy the color doesn't matter.",

This ideology has existed through out history and that's the reason why pale skin is still a beauty standard among east Asia.",

It is accurate to say that the appearance of most white people does not conform to the aesthetic concept of Chinese people . We like to use white people because European and American economies are more developed than those in other regions. Product quality is generally better than other regions. White people are<b>  ye<b> llo<b> w</b</b</b>>> peop<b> le. Bl</b>ack people are only used in European and American countries to distinguish racial differences. Actually racial discrimination. Although many people in Europe and the United States have higher levels of education than Asians, it is a matter of the past. Nowadays, Asians are not inferior to Europeans and Americans. Europe and the United States also have low-quality and racial discrimination, especially racial discrimination. This is very serious in Europe and America. These people have not been to Europe and the United States. They only understand that some people are not all. There is also the name of this channel Asian boss? We Chinese people never think that we are the biggest boss in Asia. This channel is South Korea. It's not our Chinese. We don't have the idea of \u200b\u200bbeing the boss. We just want to be able to self-strengthen, not invade other people, and not be invaded. Peaceful coexistence",

Now for me, im an average looking white guy, I always thought asian women, like japanese were soo much more beautiful compared to alot of the american women ive dated. But now I live in Japan, I find the opposite is true. Alot of the japanese women, tell me, it is very exciting for them to be with a foreign guy, and that, that is the ideal vision of beauty. Its interesting for me, because I have always felt completely the opposite. Them, oh foreigners, are more beautiful. Me, oh yea Japanese are more beautiful. So then goes the fact that whichever is farthest away from you, or opposite of you, would be obviously very attractive. Personally Ive always like asian women, cuz I think they look very exotic, compared to average americans, which is this huge mixing pot. So it goes to show you just love what is not you. Asians will love blue eyes, cuz all them have <b> black/</b>brown. Asians will love blonde hair, cuz they all have<b>  black</b>/brown hair. I have mixed<b> , colore</b>d eyes, but also kind of brownish, Ive always loved if a girl has blue eyes of course. If a girl h<b> as bla</b>ck eyes and is asian, its fine too. What most matters to me is a cute face, because, that is what i have to talk to everyday, kiss, etc. One that does not wear too much makeup, a little sometimes ok however. She has a nice smile, etc. This seems to be the most important.  The point is, people from one continent, lets say the asia area, will obviously be very attracted to the complete opposite looking person, say america, and alot of americans the same. but I think it matters how much you have dated.. etc.",

Just be proud of youself and be kind to others, that's it. Oh, and East Asians: stop whining about your look, seriously. To be honest, the fact that you're whitenig your faces and getting rid of your monolids annoys me... for me, you look way more attractive with your natural look. Trust me, and be confident!!!!",

It's like doing interviews anywhere else, most probably, people would not say negative things in front of camera. About the fair skin tone, in fact, I take them as realistic and sophisticated by saying they prefer fair skin tone. If they actually lack confident, they would get all defensive and denying such obvious beauty trends in Asia .",

I don't know what exactly they said on the video because I'm Korean, but according to some comments they didn't say white people's facial features are better. Also I don't know why Chinese prefer white skin for girls, but I see the reason Korean prefers white or bright skin. Because it was a symbol of rich people. Since they didn't need to work outside. Preference of white or bright skin in Korea isn't really related to white people. Even some people online in Korea make fun of it by the words that some westerner, who thinks Asian prefer white or bright skin because we like Caucasian skin ,says about Asian preference on white or bright skin.",

Although western facial appearance is indeed appreciated in China, we are also proud of our own Asian features. There's no meaningful comparison between these two kinds of beauties. Actually, it's very apparent that Chinese are having more diversified views about beauty, which can be found in the popularity of a new superstar, Wang Ju \u738b\u83ca. Just search for her and you will understand. ;))",

We have a teacher shortage in NZ because of salary and the working conditions. Lots of people are leaving this profession because they feel undervalued. Wages are low in comparison to living costs which are high and that is not an appealing way to live. I've lived in Australia before and want to get out of my comfort zone and immerse myself in a different culture. Having international experience looks good on your resume as well. The knowledge I gain from working in China will help me teach Chinese children if/when I go back home, plus earning close to double will help me save quicker and pay off my student loan from studying. Is it so wrong to want to learn about a different culture?",

And the lack of blemishes (marks) and moles is wonderful. Also the skin tone (colour) is usually consistent and perfect - light or tanned. We  really want to touch you and kiss your lovely skin.

That changed in more modern times with the idea of vacations and travel to tropical locals thus flipping the standard to mean that having tanned skin meant more free time and more status.

If you were proud of your <b> race,</b> you wouldn't actively avoid the sun like it's the devil & get plastic surgery to change the natural shape of your eyes and nose to look like those of white celebrities. That's why you see many brainwashed north East Asians complimenting even really average looking white foreigners as if they were Angelina Jolie /Liam Hemsworth clones. This also explains why many East Asian girls date white guys in hordes. These bunch of self haters dream about having 'beautiful mixed babies'. SMH. No racial self pride at all.",

They absolutely worship pale skin and by extension any average pale skinned person. One trip to Shanghai was enough for me to understand this. The overwhelming white male asian female combo is everywhere to see in western countries these days - US, Canada, UK, Australia, NZ, Germany, France and many others. Primary factor driving this combo is pale skin obsession of asians, particularly females. Its not going to change any time soon. It will be atleast another fifty to hundred years for this attitude to change a little. It's actually quite sad the whole society thinks like that.

If a white person SMILES, really big and a lot, \ntheir eyes take on the look of what Chinese girls eye look like ALL the time. \nYou're born with SMILING EYES.  It's also a statistical fact, given a choice white guys prefer Asian girls. \nAnd...I don't know what it's like there, but here the Chinese kids are almost ALWAYS better students. \nAlso...these kids have been taught to think white skin is prettier, when all along they have GOLDEN skin !!!",

It depends on what part of China you're in though. mostly people stare at you , take pictures of you, start talking with you in English for practice, (I could be wrong, but I feel like I got charged more money for the same items) , though almost always people are very polite and kind towards you. I guess some people might not like their picture getting taken randomly, but I don't mind it. One time in a bus, I had my feet resting on the empty chair in front of me, and a man who spoke English quite well started scolding me for it. ( I didn't know at the time that it could be considered rude to do that)",

They spent a good deal of time talking about pale skin and everything, not Caucasians or racial superiority or anything. Here's some background story. People in China generally believe that having dark complexion means you are a peasant because only peasants working in the field would get sun <b> tan.</b> This belief remains unchanged for centuries. Interestingly, the European aristocracy shared the same belief long time ago. The entire French court in the 17th century, and later the Brits, was so obsessed with \"white\" face that all aristocratic women and men painted their face white, even though the makeup contained lead and caused a lot of damage to their facial skin. Additionally, many<b>  African</b> cultures prefer pale skin over dark one, and for that reason, skin bleaching has been <b> a commo</b>n practice for centuries in many tribes or regions in Africa, despite the fact that it can cause healthy concerns and some countries, including Sou<b> th Afric</b>an, have even banned it. So it <b> has noth</b>ing to do with SELF-HATE. It's just a cultural thing.",

I suggest you guys do some research before describe Chinese ppl as self-hate one.Especially, many Tang Dynasty's poems on imperial concubine Yang, \u6768\u8d35\u5983 are needed for your reading. To fully understand China, you should be a master of Chinese language and get first hand information rather Jewish control propaganda, if you don't trust any Chinese media, you could do your research in China, and you should not just focus in several international metropolis like Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Hong Kong etc, you should visit small cities and urban areas. It's time to you remove your blinkers and view the world objectively. Prejudice can't slove the problem, only communication can. Don't let me down with you guys. And we are all human beings!

I find it sad that such attractive people wish they could be something else. It's a narrow definition of beauty that Americans don't really understand I think. I also think it's important to realize they are not trying to look white to attract white people or because they think white people are better but they have certain very specific beauty standards.  As close as I got to that was growing up in California and even though I was a tall blue-eyed blonde with an x-shaped body I didn't <b> tan </b>well, which in California is a must. So instead of being confident in myself I'd cover up my body in long pants and shirts even in 98 degree weather because I was embarrassed about my white skin. My point is, I should have embraced who I was and showed off my nice body confidently even if it wasn't<b>  tan</b>. I should have loved myself more. I wish I could go tell my teen self to just enjoy the beach and not hide. I would finally ge<b> t ta</b>n at the end of the summer and be happy the last two weeks of summer , how stupid! I've finally learned to accept my whiteness now but I wish had done so earlier. Confident, considerate, intelligent and funny  guys of whatev<b> er ra</b>ce and body type are sexy",

            "commentText": "edit: I'm surprised that this comment has gotten so much attention, let me reiterate for those who are not familiar with the situation in Asian countries (for those who have or are living in Asian countries, you know what I'm saying). The definition of a trash foreigner is someone who 1). doesn't have the ability or credential but gets much higher pays (sometimes through lying) when compared to locals with more work experiences or higher educational background 2). (Most importantly) abuses the culture and its people, use their <b> nationality </b>or<b>  ethnicity</b> to get laid, talk trash about the country and its people while enjoying all the undeserved love (sometimes the symptoms can be not able to speak a word in the local language even after years of living there) . I've seen and heard of so many cases where foreigners find at least a dozen girls over the span of weeks; there are always cases of rape, obnoxious behaviors (e.g: Logan Paul and Ricegum) etc. You cannot compare immigrants to the US to these kinds of foreigners in China, immigrants are hardworking people trying to fit in and trying to make a decent living. Those trash foreigners only want to ge<b> t se</b>x and easy money \n and GTFO of the country they are taking advantage of. The foreigner scene in China is polarizing, divided between extremely openminded and or well-educated individuals and absolute trash. \n\nOriginal comment: Honestly, I think if they understand the \"foreigner scene\" in China more, the more disappointed they will be. Many foreigners in China (especially whites from more developed nations) are so-called trash foreigners, basically meaning they are the people that cannot find jobs in their home country so decided to move to China to seek opportunities (by taking advantage of their white looks). It's sad to see how people believe those people to be more knowledgeable and capable than hard-working young locals.",

                    "commentText": "Let me explain you: when a Chinese goes to your country to work it's about the individual. If you go to China to work, the point is \"what does China need?\". This is why the law states that if same conditions, the Chinese must be hired first, and why workers withouth great background will not be accepted, as they are not useful for the country.\n\nYet you will see a citizen from a country thas has that mentality (which is legit, of course, the have the right to manage their own country as they wish) call you loser or trash when in fact you will only work there if you're very good at your field. Forget about the \"honest and willing workers\" because that doesn't apply to China, it's not about honesty, it's about filling the needs of the country in a way a Chinese would not be able to (that's what the law says, obviously there are many Chinese workers who are just excellent, my working place, just to set an example, has many of them). It's legit, of course, but that doesn't deny the fact that it's hypocritical to say this when you're exporting low-background workers to other countries and only welcoming those who are highly qualified.\n\nSo what's with the \"taking advantadge thing\"? Actually it's part of the Chinese <b> racism,</b> parents want a foreign face to claim how good his kid is at English, it's also about face, reputation, call it the way you want. A<b>  black</b> teacher with a Princeton degree may be the best option you will ever have, but if you hire him the parents won't be able to tell his friends and relatives that his kid is in a western sophisticated environment, because his teacher hi<b> s blac</b>k, who knows if he may come from Africa? So, who creates the topic? T<b> he bla</b>ck/white teacher, or the costumers that are behind that? But here you see the final result by reading the comments: the Chinese be<b> ing rac</b>ist it's your fault, so you should be ashamed because they have the right t<b> o be ra</b>cist. \n\nDon't get me wrong about that, to me it's very disgusting to see parents cheated in such a terrible way, paying a lot of money that they earned by working hard just to have an unqualified teacher. Anyway, academies cannot hire foreigners, so this is why they look at their skin and not at their background.",

You left that out because plastic surgery to get all of those things are extremely popular in Asia. I think the farmers excuse is really played out doesn't really make any sense, genetics deal with how fair or how <b> tan </b>you are going to be. It would be completely insane to say all the rich people in Asia back then were pale, so thats saying NO<b>  tan</b> people had money, thats a lie. The sad thing about the plastic surgery and pale skin is that they want \"westerner\" features but still look Asian after getting the surgeries ( Asian people love who you are) not all but majority. There i<b> s nothin</b>g wrong with doing any of that because its YOUR body and if you can change you should. But there is an issue when you wont admit to why you want to change it. Plus people in  Asian countries need to learn that not all westerners are white, we come in all colors of the rainbow. P.s I know you didnt say anything about plastic surgery but I just wanted to add that in.",

All the characters look Caucasian... its funny how to be beautiful one girl said you have to be fair and tall...well it's obviously a ploy to wrangle money from normal citizens because the average person in China isn't fair and isn't tall at All! but the companies will tell you so and you will keep spending money to change things you can't change.\n\n In Africa we have issues with skin whitening too but not as standardised. So many darker skinned women who are beyond lauded but skin and \"good hair\" are seen as better.",

It's a beauty standard comes from ancient time when we didn't even know the existence or white people. Not sure why ancient chinese like jade-like skin. But for modern chinese girls, we know we have flatter face. Being a little brighter makes complements the gentleness of our smaller nose and eyes, being fair makes us feels not that flat and gives us more confidance.  Fair skin makes us feels ourselves more girly, I guess due to ancient culture somehow as well.  It's definately NOT abou<b> t rac</b>e. If chinese girls have more dimensional face that looks good with any skintone<b> ,  nobo</b>dy would cares about being brighter or not.

And the being fair tradition thing came along maybe 4000 years ago, it doesn't specifically say, but that is just what I infer. I am almost definite that back then, 99% of the Chinese people never saw somebody with a western white complexion. Just a correction for Xuan Zh, did you mean that in the ancient times Chinese people, especially girls liked to wear jade? Because<b>  nobody</b> that I am aware of in human history has had natural green skin. Or perhaps you meant that the skin was really like soft and shimmery( Even though skin can't shimmer), I just can't translate it to English, and Google Translate says that it means crystal clear, but that is wrong too. Anyways, in Chinese, it is \u6676\u83b9\u5254\u900f. Please correct me if I am wrong.",

By that, i mean, why are you crediting the work that some white people have done, to all of white people? unless you invented math, physics, chemistry, biology, geology, car, plane, steamed ship, phone, computer, and the internet, dont act like you did.\n\nAlso literally anyone can cherry pick to make one thing seem better than the other. Why don't you use actual data to support you claims? And even if you use actual data, there's always people who dont conform to what the data says. For example, even though the average IQ of a human is 100, that doesn't mean everyone has 100IQ; case in point, i can very obviously tell that you are below the average.",

I don't want to repeat my statement again. You have your own view, I have my own. I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it. Do not try to attack other people with different views and impose different western values into non-west ppl, such like Middle East, North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan, Russia, Africa, Southeast Asia, Central Asia etc. Stop spreading Jewish Zionist propaganda, like what Asian Boss do.

It's also a statistical fact, given a choice white guys prefer Asian girls. \nAnd...I don't know what it's like there, but here the Chinese kids are almost ALWAYS better students. \nAlso...these kids have been taught to think white skin is prettier, when all along they have GOLDEN SKIN !!!",

I don't know how ancient asian thinks, but now Its just that we east asian have flatter face, being brighter can make our features doesn't look that flat, and compliments the gentleness of our smaller eyes and nose, makes us feels we are cuter somehow. Its hard to describe. Its definately not abou<b> t rac</b>e.

This is your 50 cent army, hardliner, who repeats \"East Asia Unite\", no matter whether they are Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc... They also hold a ton of contempt for Asians they deem inferior, or have assimilated into other cultures.\n2. Intellectuals. People who value history, science, and just have a general respect for the process of learning and studying itself. These Asian people are smart, and they know it, and they have clear reason for their pride, reasons they are generally willing to share. \n3. Propagandists with Intellectual Capacity. These are Asian people you can still learn from. They share genuine information with you at first, but eventually reveal an unsubstantiated and strong Asian Supremacy, and these people usually hold contempt for Asians they deem inferior, similar to the Propagandists.\n\nI am most interested by your comments.

That does not give you magical insight into a whole <b> race.</b> It reminds me of how I lived in South Africa and had relatively peaceful days interacting with different races, then I moved away and apparently, people in South Africa are killing each other over<b>  race</b>. Then again, this is anecdotal. Also, I feel to weirdly prove your point, you've also somehow vouched for the other side. Especially with your drivel about men pursuing women. Honestly, it has don<b> e nothin</b>g to prove that Asians don't worship white men (I personally don't care if they do, that is not my problem as a Kenyan, I am solely interested in \"decolonizing the mind\" a la Ngugi Wa Thiong'o ). Also, there are plenty of white countries and Asian countries with higher homicide rates than a good portion of Africa. Also, it <b> is Indi</b>an Americans that push the earning gap for Asians. Not sure why that goes unnoticed, but other Asian groups aren't out earning anyone. Furthermore, to come at <b> the bl</b<b> >ack </b>race when countries like Korea have the highest per capita plastic surgery rate is just something. On that note, not sure how we went down this path when white supremacy and the Western world have affected both continents negatively. I notice Churches in Asia are filling up slowly and in Africa they have been full for a long time. I notice that music in Asia is largely becoming rap and bubble gummy pop. At least Africa has seen a rise of Afro pop but folk music is to my discontent, dying. I have no intentions of getting married but honestly, finding a good partner in life is difficult so if you are married outside of<b>  your</b> race and it makes you happy, so be it. I am also one of<b>  those</b> black women who wears their naturally curly hair and quite frankly, there is a massive hair movement<b>  in th</b>e black community right now which is great! I will say, I see more of these type of moment<b> s in t</b>he black community than Asian community which is probably why there is the assumption that Africans have more pride. I might not necessarily agree with aspects of that. On that note, I have no solutions so I am relatively useless to this conversation.",

But in fact, chinese people, especially the girls, has a record of using whitening skincare product, dated back all the way to the Han dynasty, which is 2000 years ago. \n\nIm pretty sure that there aren't that many white people wondering around in China 2000 years ago, so 'white wanna be s' don't not exist back in the days\n\nAnd yes, the typical Caucasian facial features are desired by many chinese people, but Chinese can naturally have very fair skin, it just determine on the amount of exposure you have toward the sun Ray. So yeah, being white is not just a white ppl thing.\n\n\nLast but not least, have you been China? it's so freaking hot. Why won't u protect yourself from the sun instead of getting fried.",

I can't speak for all Caucasians but I  personally love the Asian facial structure, and especially Asian eyes. I remember watching a program about a Korean<b>  woman</b> having eyelid surgery to give her that crease and while she seemed happy with the effect,  I couldn't help thinking she looked prettier before the surgery.",

I look for and judge people by their character; their behavior, much more than their physical appearance. I would prefer a kind and genuinely happy face more than striking physical features, including skin tone.",

Women want to be seen as the smaller and \"fairer\" <b> sex </b>biologically regardless of any socially imposed feminist ideology. Guys also want to be seen as more bigger, masculine and stronger than women, and since having darker skin to females plays to all of those \"male\" attributes, guys also prefer women with a lighter skin tone to themselves. Of course it depends on the general skin tone of that group of people.\n\nI'm a Latin guy with light brown (type 3/4 skin), and I also prefer women with a skin tone at the very least a little lighter than my own and I don't really think of it any differently compared to preferring a<b>  woman</b> shorter in height than myself. However, unlike height, skin colour is not a deal breaker for me all at all. Height, body shape and personality are far more important to me in <b> a woma</b>n than skin tone. \n\nMy experience with women here in the UK by the way is that they prefer the same when it comes to men. That is probably why tanning is so popular here among both men and women.",

So while she didn't explicitly say liti was better, in the context of the sentence she meant that they were. She was listing liti as a reason they are more attractive. That's how the sentence works. \nThe man did not explicitly say he found them more attractive, and instead said they were liti (but he implied it a little by saying that they look like statues.) So the translation isn't literal, but took context into account. I agree that the mans words could be translated slightly more literally though.",

The interviewer asks one of the interviewees if Western people look more attractive in general, and one of the interviewees clearly replied, \"Yes.\" Then she went on to say how Western people have more pronounced features, implying that these reasons were why Western people are more attractive as a whole. Maybe you need to go study Chinese again better, or re-watch the actual video? And not try and shittalk Asian Boss so much just because their views don't fit in with your own agenda/views. Based on what the people were saying about statues and the like, they definitely were not implying the stuff in a negative light. On the contrary, despite what the translations tried to paint, objectively it seems like they all acknowledged that looking \"western\" is an in right now, especially with how products and brands invite western people to model and how businesses use western people to appear more distinguished as a business. Don't know why people get so antsy over this kind of stuff.",

I have also heard that asians prefer white skin, not because they want to be caucasian but because light skin implies wealth, that you dont have to work outside for a job where you get sun all day. As for the Asian girl who outright said that she thinks caucasians are prettier, well, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, there are plenty of caucasian men and women who prefer Asian women.... people are just creating issues where there dont need to be any,,,",

The biggest self hating white worshipping east asians. Going to get worse, more half white kids especially from wmaf having white privilege. White husbands thinking they can speak on asian issues simply because their partner is asian. What a joke of a <b> race </b>this has become. All this effort of chinese economy booming is really for foreigners when government/politicians urging more of them to come here and not even tackling white privilege.",

Yes , they and myself do prefer fair skin but isn't it the same how people here prefer taned skin? Though I live where a country contains 84% whites , I actually try to avoid them (like a lot of chinese people I know) if i don't know them. From past experience,  there is quite a few that are <b> racist.</b> Not all whites are<b>  racist</b> ,of course, but I've only ever been discriminated from them. I used to feel sad from those comments but i don't care about them anymore- it's more to avoid feeling embarrassed for their parents now .\n\nEdit: I've also only ever seen Asian and Asian couples( Chinese and/or other Asians )and not so much with other races.\nP.s A chinese guy friend of mine just started dating another chinese girl. They're adorable!",

            "commentText": "As a white person who's lived in China, how you are treated hugely differs from city to city, and obviously also from person to person. Generally speaking, you have a lot of privilege (positive stereotypes about you), but a lot of Chinese people also tend to think of you as some kind of exotic zoo animal to stare at, take pictures of and touch whenever they feel like it, regardless of whether you protest.\nIt's easier to hitchhike or ask for help as a white person than as someone who looks Asian. According to the Chinese people I've asked about that, that's because they don't think white people would scam them, but they are constantly suspicious of fellow Chinese people. The people in this video are also definitely right that it's easy to get a job as a translator or English teacher, even if your English isn't actually that great, but only if you're white, not some other kind of foreigner. But on the other hand, you can't really get jobs with actual substance, those are reserved for Chinese people. \nAlso, it's hard to get cabs, because cabdrivers are scared of speaking English so they'll avoid you (didiche and uber solve this problem). I've also sometimes been denied service at post offices or food stands because I was white, but that was rare. Sometimes they'll even pretend not to understand what you're saying when you speak Chinese to them (my Chinese level is really not the problem here, because they'd suddenly perfectly understand what I was saying when it was convenient just minutes later). Also, random Chinese people passing by will think you don't speak Mandarin, so they'll say the nastiest things about you while you're standing right next to them. That's also how I know I was denied service specifically because I was not Chinese, they were just like \"\u4f60\u770b\uff0c\u5916\u56fd\u4eba\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5e2e\u4ed6\u4eec\u5417\uff1f\" \"\u7b97\u4e86\u5427\u3002\"",

Even the successful Elaine L. Chao, her and her sisters' husbands are white, too. \nActually the video picks up too little people to interview. What is happening in China is beyond all of your imagination. It is a trend that in Chinese young people's opinions, some white people come to China because they are just low-life losers who can not find a job in their own countries and come. In addition, some of tourists also don't respect Chinese at all. They always take it granted that we should speak English to them and call our girls \"easy girls\" which generated hatred on internet. I can tell you we mainland Chinese people are more and more confident now. Many white people only love to go to southeast asian countries like Philippine for example because it is highly possible that they will be treated like VIPs.",

I would also say they're the most handsome ones among East Asian men. If you watch Taiwanese/Chinese dramas/films, you will see that their male actors do not use much cosmetics or BB cream or unrealistic kind of make-up just to look handsome. They're just simply handsome the way they are and are more natural or masculine compared to Korean stars.. By the way, I studied at a Chinese school in the Philippines and hell yeah there are a lot of cutesies everywhere even the ones who wear glasses.  It's so rare to see cuties when you walk on some streets of Seoul.",

In the video, there were a few questions about foreigners, but it mostly had to do with Chinese people's view on paler skin tones for their own <b> race.</b> It was interesting to hear about the guy who thought it was better for guys to be darker and girls pale because more athletic means more masculine. To answer the question though, my experience includes other people picking on me and saying I should get out more. I do think in areas that value athleticism like the U.S. everyone tries to go for a sun kissed version of their skin tone. That can be near impossible for really fair skinned people.",

Just remember my words, when china continues settling chinese in africa like they do in mongolia and tibet. And just because an economy grows fast doesn't mean it's not a shithole. In spite of fast growth in recent years, Ethiopias GDP per capita is one of the lowest in the world, and the economy faces a number of serious structural problems. Agriculture constitutes around 85% of the labour force. However, the service sector represents the largest portion of the GDP. Also germany is the biggest partner when it comes to export coffee.",

I looked up to this channel, But never expect you would stoop this low? If you do this same experiment to those whites/Caucasian they will never say anything positives about Asia<b> n rac</b>e, except for those few male, who will say Asi<b> an wom</b>an are submissive, that will be the most positive feedback you'll get from them, I've seen it in other channel.

I'm so sleepy right now, well whatever~  first of all ,if you know history well as you claimed\uff0cthan you should know paper making and gunpowder were high techs in ancient time , and we all know how gunpowder change the human history, and without paper making\uff0c how do westerners spread their knowledge so efficiently  during Renaissance and Reformation? Without success of  those, I don't think the British can open the modern world that soon, talk about Capitalist and Industrial Revolution? No way, at least not that early. Not to say China is the first country  invented modern political system and civil service system\uff0cand things like paper money, don't think using paper money is a easy thing back in 1000 yrs ago, it requires  anti-counterfeiting techniques,\u3001bank and high credibility of government. And more inventions but I can't think of  right away\n\nAnd Chinese and Asians innovated and invented a lot of things based on modern industry ,  it just not so revolutionary like car and plane,  just small inventions like LED and OLED, VCD, and some parts of smart phone and car etc, and there are a lot of Chinese American scientist in USA, Nobel Prize winner Chen Ning Yang is Chinese,  but to be honest  it's a fact that most of modern inventions were  invented by whites,   but China has started to modernized only few decades ago , we got a lot of catch up to do, and learn(some say it's copy) from the west,  and I believe that as soon as China reach the same develop level as the West, we will starting to invent and innovate more\n\nPS  the reason  I said 'that's not my job to inform you'   not bcoz I got <b> nothing </b>to say,  first I'm tired, and also due to my terrible english<b>  witch</b> I learn from the TV shows, so it's super annoying and exhausting to write a long comment  and still got a lot of things don't know how to express in english, that's why~",

To list a few of China's most precocious innovations in the field: 1) A functionally complete calculus of fractional operations (not to mention symbolic positional decimal notation) by -300, echoes of which can be seen in a recently recovered coordinate multiplication table from Qin.  2) A binomial expansion algorithm for root extraction with a Ruffini-Horner optimisation, first applied to square and cube roots in the -1st century Nine Chapters_, and eventually to polynomials in the Middle Ages.  3) Also in the Nine Chapters, the world's first general solution for systems of linear equations, expressed as a square matrix of coefficients, via an algorithm known to the West as Gaussian elimination (absent in the West before Isaac Newton).  4) As a distillation of operations with systems of linear equations, the world's first functionally complete calculus of negative numbers, including multiplication (sign inversion), by 3rd-century commentator on _Nine Chapters Liu Hui.  5) This one not strictly algebraic, but well-worth considering: the Cartesian coordinate system, plotting dependent variable (virtue) against independent variable (time), this one casually invented by none other than the most educated<b>  woman</b> in ancient history, Ban Zhao, in her contribution to the _Hanshu_.\n\nIf this tiny list of Chinese contributions alone doesn't strike you as \"seriously important,\" then you are welcome to shun them for what they are and go back to counting livestock with your fingers...\n\nPhysics: While it makes little sense to speak of physics before Isaac Newton, the classical Micians, 2000 years before Newton, did have an accurate concept of the properties of gravity and its relation to directional force and motion (see Mojing B 26, 27), which is farther than Aristotle got around that time.  They were also the first in recorded history to describe the optics of concave and convex mirrors.\n\nChemistry: this field didn't even exist until about 200 years ago when atomic theory was developed (or ~240 if you start with Antoine Lavoisier's stoichiometry).  Before that, virtually all of Western knowledge about matter was based on alchemy of the Four Elements which basically involved trying to burn everything to see if it turns to gold.  At least the Chinese made good of something with their experiments in the form of *gunpowder*... so that ol<b> ' white</b>y can \"discover\" a new continent by heroically stealing it behind a matchlock from the least fortified peoples on Earth, then go on to call it \"insignificant!\"  SMH\n\nBiology: fair enough, the Chinese really d<b> id nothi</b>ng for this field.  \"TCM\" is an abomination that needs to be wiped out.  But believe it or not, the late Warring States Chinese were the world's first ecological conservationists in their rationale for regulating seasonal hunting and forestry.\n\nGeology: Um... the world's first seismoscope?  Hello!  I thought you were \"very well informed on Chinese history.\"  Anyways, considering how the Chinese invented crop rotation and various practical soil sciences (ridge-furrow planting, anyone?) that define modern agriculture and are a big part of what sustains the Earth's population, I don't see how it could be less important than knowing the difference between a stalactite and a stalagmite...\n\nCar: fossil fuel (-3rd century); helical (chevron) gearing (-2nd century); crank-and-connecting rod reciprocal motion mechanisms (-2nd century; first seen in Han rotary querns, industrial-sized winnowing fans, and floor looms) that underlie the internal combustion engine (and the steering wheel)...  Oh, and as for that steel chassis, um...: blast furnaces and decarburised steel (since Han era).\n\nPlane: kite gliders (-4th century), rotor blades (and rotary sculling fans in general, like winnowing fans, from -2nd century at the latest), hot air balloons (flying lanterns), rocketry.  Can't take off without at least one of these.\n\n\"steamed ship\": Hey genius, try crossing the Atlantic in an 800-foot ship without bulkhead compartments and a rudder... or a compass... or steel, for that matter.  All insignificant things, I'm sure.\n\nComputer: binary arithmetic (as implied by a -2nd-century epigraphic reordering of the Changes (OG text circa -9th century) from Mawangdui).  Of course, you could always go analog /s\n\nWell, it's been a pleasure!  Reply for further discussion on China's intellectual history.  Enjoy your spaceships!",

In every<b>  race</b> of humans, even from the darkes<b> t blac</b>k people to the whitest white people, there has always been preference for those who are whiter within a population. The reason is that fair or whiter skin indicates youth and fertility, as skin naturally darkens throu<b> gh agei</b>ng and after menopause when women become infertile. Dark skin is also an indicator of skin damage through formation of freckl<b> es, </b>age spots and other discolorations. And since East Asians have always had a preference for more youthful looks compared to other races and ethnicities, it is natural that we prefer whiter skin as it relates to the attributes that humans naturally find youthful.",

As in comics, characters look very much alike due to the cartoonish artstyle, so coloring of hair and eyes are used to differentiate between characters who would otherwise look alike due to the ambiguity of the design of comic characters if coloring were not used (which i<b> n blac</b>k and white comics, would mean differentiation of characters happening through fashion and hairstyles instead <b> of color</b>ed hair or eyes). And this same reason applies to real life when girls w<b> ear colo</b>red lenses, to show off their individuality as naturally, East Asians all <b> have b</b>lack hair and dark brown eyes, so we<b> aring co</b>lored lenses allows girls to stand out from other girls to draw attention to themselves as girls love attention and being the center of <b> it. So c</b>olored lenses are entirely about wanting to be unique, individualistic, receiving attention and standing out from the crowd, NOT because we want to \"be Caucasian\".

Long before northern Europeans labelled themselves whites and everyone else with various sort of tinge. IMHO human skin has only one type of melanin and it turns to dark brown from clear with exposure to sunlight to protect the dermis. As with nature  some people shed the darkened layers,  others don't easily. That is all to it.  It doesn't confer racial superiority because skin is not an extension of the brain.",

That was the foundation first before white and brown had it. There is<b>  nothing</b> wrong with having light skin, however we can agree the light skin movement was pushed by whites because before that th<b> e blac</b>k planet was about tribalism never about colourism. How did it come across, well let's use the a book called anthropology genectical fantasy author Charles Darwin in his own words said that history of the whites is that they were in refrigerator box meaning the ice cave and developed a unempathic hatred towards natural things even towards themselves and see a deficiency in themselves outwardly and inwardly and as genetically recessive, and  project the worst of themselves on other people. Due to their environment and lack of civilisation knowledge they would sleep with their dead one's and not but u them, drink blood of each other, steal from each other and lie to each other when a little of bit of food would grow so not a lot of them would eat all of it out. Then when the Africans recused them from their inhabitant abode and taught them how to be civilise. They the whites started having kids with the Africans and slowly adopted their custom and took over their culture, and used their kids as a tool to oppress the<b> ir Afric</b>an side. Eventually conquered , and used that as an ideology of survival of the fitness, in terms if what the animals do howvebr in his book mentions that whites Don't really believe that in fact they use anci<b> ent Afri</b>can knowledge to control world e.g sepiroth knowledge= tree knowledge which they got from ancient Egypt, and nilo valley. That been said developed an alter ego called the other which allows them to justify their evil ways of projecting victim mentality in the act of oppressing blacks. Why bec<b> ause b</b>lack people r genetically dominant,<b>  the</b>y age slower,  their organs r built different which is why whites steal the<b> m, the</b> black <b> man an</b>d woman can repopulate themselves in any o<b> ther n</b>on-black men or women non-blacks can only repopulate themselves in themselves. Blacks r envied also for their historical achievements, remedies maths science physics, architectures, fashion, beauty, style which started with blacks first, prymids how we built as multi stone computer system activate by sound and also a heath care place. Also blacks r envied and hated for their intellectual potential in sports and how over 100% of the invention all nations use that desce<b> nded f</b>rom black people was i<b> nvente</b>d by black people and some they did before slavery and some in slavery and after slavery while been oppressed and without going to the same schools as white kids. This is the reason why whites changed and blow off the noses all around the blacks lands why because whites know they r recessive and know that their whole history starts with africans",

This isn't just skin tone it goes for everything hair colour, eye colour, hair type , facial features, body type. Almost everyone wants something they don't have.",

White foreigners usually had impunity within Chinese territories because Chinese police (back in imperial times) wouldn't dare arrest White foreigners for fear of the colonizing governments butting in. Moreover, we fought several colonial wars, the most famous is the Opium Wars, where China tried to outlaw opium but British forced us to buy opium and addict the people of China with opium.",

However, unless you're white with hair that stands out (incredibly long, incredibly wavy/curly, incredibly bright such as platinum blond/red, etc.) <b> a blac</b>k person will attract WAY more attention for their hair (I have stories for DAYS about random Chinese people coming up and grabbing my hair).\nWhite is right, most definitely. Anyone who tells you differently is lying. Just go to any super market and look at how almost all the beauty products have \"meibai\" or whitening in them. Look at all the people wearing long sleeves or carrying an umbrella on a sunny cloudless day.  Ask mo<b> st bla</b>ck English teachers about their job hunt vs. a white English teacher (some ads even explicitly say<b>  no bl</b>ack people). Ask a Chinese person about their stereotypes of white people<b>  vs. b</b>lack people. If they're being honest, the ones <b> about </b>black people are way more negative (we're lazy, drug dealers/users, dirty, violent, etc.).\nThrough all of it, they'll say they <b> aren't </b>racist though (because in China there aren't people from other races, so how can <b> they be</b> racist? <-- This was said <b> to me,</b> a black person, living in China, I obviously didn't exist. lol)\nI will say though, the origin of preference for white skin is because it used to be that the only pale people were rich, as everyone else had to work in agriculture under the hot sun. It started out as more of a status/wealth origin than preferenc<b> e for</b> one race over another. HOWEVER, it has now moved into a preference for Eurocentric things and the media has played a big part in that.",

As a tall white guy with brown hair and bright blue eyes who's been called very attractive in both the States and my time in China, SKorea, Japan and even Guam, when I was in Suzhou, I was fawned over by the Women there. The attention was ridiculous at times.\n\nThe odd thing is, it wasn't just Asia, the attention was also in various parts of Africa when I was doing Humanitarian Aid when I PCA'd on heavies for two years (USAF). being as polite and personable didn't help as I was a magnet for guys and girls which is something I don't have to contend with as much in the US.",

I have been living in China for quite some time, specifically Suzhou which is about 30 mins from Shanghai by fast train, if I am not mistaken its the 10th largest city in China. There is a large expat community here, majority of the expats are white which is why as a <b> woman </b>of color I get more stares and pictures taken of me than my white counterparts. But the level of privilege that you have as a white person in China is well known (job prospects/opportunities), white people here acknowledge as well because it is so blatant. I've seen it within my own place of employment, because Chinese parents prefer their kids to be taught by white teachers, because they feel it their child would be more cultured and poised. Its disheartening but you cant let it hold you back from the strength and positivity that manifests within you. There are always going to be disadvantages wherever you go, but its how you respond to them. You can open up a dialogue about it, keep quiet, or move on to something else.",

Hope my explaination could remove your misunderstanding and anger. After all, every<b>  race</b> have its own good-looking standard.",

                    "commentText": "Linn Z OK. You could have your understanding of fair skin. But that's my conclusion of research. Actually in many small cities and rural areas, veteran citizens still think Caucasian are far from good-looking, they think Caucasian are ppl with \u72d0\u81ed, body odor smells badly, \u6263\u7709\u6d3c\u773c, \u5973\u4eba\u7537\u76f8\uff0c\u7537\u4eba\u91ce\u76f8, some ppl even call Caucasian \u9b3c\u4f6c, literally means ghost or devil. Chinese ppl have strong cultural confindence, you could call them \u871c\u6c41\u81ea\u4fe1, mysterious self-love, it's preinstalled in everyone's mind, China must and should be the best forever. My opinion is beauty standard is just the thing like cutting edge technology, we must have our own rule, just like Hollywood, which is important to national image. After all, Caucasian and any races people include Chinese ppl will look down upon a self-hate <b> nation.</b> That's it. Leave your guidance, if you wish",

Second of all, I don't really want to be educated on a subjective matter such as \"what is true beauty\", that is just ridiculous. Lastly,  from what I can tell you mean pale skinned not grey skinned. Please look up that kind of stuff before posting. In western culture that is such a demeaning and <b> racist </b>thing to say. You keep saying that you don't want to offend anyone yet you use the phrase \"lifeless grey skin\". How could the content of the video ever justify such a statement? It is a disgusting remark and you ought to edit it immediately. Good day sir",

Just another window for your understanding of the world. No <b> racism </b>in China, Almost 100% Chinese are the same<b>  race</b>. No concept of racial discrimination inter-China. Somebody believ<b> e nationalis</b>m and populism, just like Westerners, but government oppress any kind <b> of nationali</b>sm prevent China into countries like Nazi-Germany and former Soviet Union. You shouldnot just want to listen words what you willing to listen, the objective fact is not transferred to the will of human beings. You just want to listen ppl praise that you Caucasians are with good skin and deny the fact East Asian are those who have better skin. I can applogise for my misusing adjective to describe what Caucasian's skin looks like. For better understanding, I suppose you take the Chinese sentences as standard, ignore the English version. And you must realize that Chinese have its own rule define fair skin and almost social science. You have any doubts and thoughts even angers towards this issue means I finally achieve my goal, help ppl understand different concept about Chinese fair skin and Caucasian one. After all, Marco Polo envied rich wealth of ancient China and China's fair skin. If possible, you can help me modify my English version sentence, a better communition, help ppl view the world with dialectical point of views.",

For example, I grew up in the UK, have a British accent and have received all of my qualifications according to the British education system. However, I have repeatedly been rejected by schools of good standing and some affiliated with famous universities in China because I look too Chinese. Many have admitted to me that they still prefer white people to teach their students English, even though they know that I am FAR MORE QUALIFIED and their English is not that good. Asians should stick together and combat the stereotype that 'white people are better.' If not, we would always be ruled by 'white privilege.'",

But because i am always in the sun, my skin gets darker, and i dont really mind getting darker because i am outside.\n\nBut since i'm outside a lot, my skin gets rough and i get scratches and scrapes, etc. So in comparison to mine, (in general) caucasian skin is smoother and softer.\n\nAnd i'm asian. So if there was a reason for me to want to have caucasian skin, it would be because I like the texture, and doesnt necessarily have anything to do with colour",

Hopefully Asians and Africans will stop using bleaching (brightening I think is ok?) products since this lead to skin cancer. So scary :(",

When in reality, white people should recognize how exotic they are to the rest of the world. White people don't realize that they're the minorities at 6% of the global population. So don't feel ashamed or made to feel guilty by others when you want to preserve your beauty and uniqueness <3 .\r Its okay for Asians to love and support each other.

The Chinese teach about \"the century of humiliation\" which was caused by white people being aggressive and violent against China in the Opium Wars.

What I notice is whenever the subject of Asian self hatred comes up, there will be people coming out of the woodwork to declare how lovely we are. Normally, you don't see them.

We have no allies except for a few POC fighting for the same cause. \n\nEven when they do mean it, it's usually in a fetishy way or they only like the Asians who fit the Euro beauty standard.

I guess I just have a wider definition of beauty. If someone is healthy and proportioned well for their body type I think they are attractive. Or, if they aren't proportioned that great but have confidence about themselves, are considerate, humorous, smart and interesting then they are super sexy",

You realize Blacks are better at athletics while Asians have a higher IQ? How do you even process that with your \"all races are equal\" narrative? If you think all races are equally attractive, that is your unique opinion, but when you quantify attractiveness in terms of facial symmetry, jaw structure, eye shape, et cetera, Whites are, on average, objectively more attractive than other races. It is actually because Asians weren't brainwashed into thinking that all races are exactly the same as you were that they acknowledge this. Here, consider this, Whites have more attractive faces, but Blacks definitely have more attractive bodies on average, the men have larger penises and higher amounts of skeletal muscle mass, while the females have larger buttocks, though Whites do tend to have larger breasts. We are all different and unequal and those differences correlate on average with <b> race,</b> it's called diversity and it is a beautiful thing.",

I would not expect a foreigner to subscribe to the show face culture and work longer hours than they would back home. We are also used to speaking our mind (mostly) or expecting equality and not subscribing to hierarchy. The boss is equal to the employee. I am not sure, but from what I've seen that Chinese are not used to this when it comes to hierarchy in the office? So would this mean that Asian employers give foreigners more leeway than the natives?",

Ostatnio nawet widzia\u0142am zestawienie ameryka\u0144skich piosenkarek kt\u00f3re pobi\u0142y jaki\u015b rekord: jedna czarna i dwie latynoski.(cho\u0107 nawet nie zwr\u00f3ci\u0142am na to uwagi) Komentarz o najwi\u0119kszej liczbie lajkow pod zdj\u0119ciem: 'dobrze ze nie ma \u017cadnej bia\u0142ej szm...' Ostatnio jedna dziewczyna z Polski m\u00f3wi\u0142a \u017ce w szkole w Ameryce by\u0142a przesladowana bo by\u0142a bia\u0142\u0105 Polka. By\u0142a mniejszo\u015bci\u0105 na zaj\u0119ciach. Wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 ludzi w klasie to ludzie koloru.Obra\u017ca\u0142 ja nawet czarny nauczyciel. I to nie rasizm.. :) W Polsce my nie mamy poj\u0119cia co si\u0119 dzieje i nadal uwa\u017camy, \u017ce biali s\u0105 tacy wstretni w stosunku do innych.\nwi\u0119c kiedy piszesz \u017ce nie uwa\u017casz si\u0119 za bia\u0142ego to jest im to na r\u0119k\u0119. Ale wiedz \u017ce w Ameryce popularna jest te\u017c wiedza \u017ce bycia bia\u0142ym teraz modne jest si\u0119 wstydzic. \nPowinno by\u0107 tak \u017ce uczymy si\u0119 r\u00f3wno\u015bci wszystkich ras a nie obra\u017cania rasy bia\u0142ej. My biali w Ameryce jeste\u015bmy uczeni siedzenia cicho gdy nas obra\u017caj\u0105 i wmawia si\u0119 nam ze to my jeste\u015bmy rasistami w stosunku do nich.\nPoza tym spojrz na komentarze pod twoj\u0105 wypowiedzi\u0105... pisz\u0105 jaka sk\u00f3ra bia\u0142ych jest brzydka i jak azjatycka jest naj\u0142adniejsza... bia\u0142ych nazywa si\u0119 bia\u0142ymi dlatego ze sa najja\u015bniejsi, \u017caden niewybielony azjata nie jest ja\u015bniejszy od nieopalonego bia\u0142ego. Poza tym zawsze jak Azjatka ma dziecko z Europejczykiem(\u015brodkowy /polnocny) to to dziecko ma sk\u00f3r\u0119 ciemniejsza od w pe\u0142ni Europejskiego dziecka",

YOU ALL KNOW GOOD AND WELL that when someone says you are <b> black,</b> white,<b>  ye<b> llo<b> w</b</b</b><b> >>,<b>  </b</b>>red, or brown that they are NOT talking exclusively about skin color. Who would have thought that anyone would have to clarify that? It boggles the mind that people think in such literal terms, when LITERALLY - you have seen crayons and you know that no one's skin (or very few people) is actually W<b> HITE, </b><b> BLA<b> CK,<b>  </b</b</b>>>Y<b> ELL<b> O</b</b>>W, or RED. Give me a freakin break. THOSE ARE POLITICAL (not LITERAL) TERMS designed create general, cultural, social blocks to put people in. Who needs to be told that we are ALL shades of BROWN? Like, really??! And these are probably terms more accepted, understood, and propagted in the west - specifically in America - where our history and ethos and culture and society and institutions and laws and families and economies have been founded on these types of divisions. It is understood that WHITE people, around the globe are Europeans - period. It is unde<b> rstood</b> that BLACK people around the <b> globe ar</b>e of African descent - period. It is un<b> der<b> sto<b> o</b</b</b>>>d that YELLOW people around the globe are East Asians - period. It is<b>  un<b> d</b</b>>erstood that RED people around the globe are Native/Indigenous. It is understood that BROWN people around the globe are South Asians, I guess.... although brown identification is also a catchall/mutt ident<b> ifica</b>tion as mixed race blacks, latinos, and Middle Eastern people all fall into that category, too. So now we can be clear that the actual color is a representation of a group of people and does not, necessarily, mean the color of the person.

It's actually interesting because if they asked what do think about foreigners, most Asian countries would think a foreigner is a staple blond and blue eyed white person. That's what's I've found whenever I watch a video with that question involved. Also I feel like it's not that a big of deal...and I don't see how many other variations of the question you would like of them to ask?",

People of China please know that there are many white people that value almond shaped eyes, smooth Asian skin, less body hair, <b> thin </b>agile body types! Every<b>  ethnicity</b> has beauty!\nUpdate: I now realize (from other commenters) that the translations were misleading and they aren't saying the think being Caucasian is prettier but just mentioning  some features that fits their beauty standard. They mean like milky white skin not freckly pink white-person skin. I think healthy skin of any color is beautiful and you have to admit most Asians are very into skin health. This does make me a little grateful for America for having a much wider definition of beauty since we have a much more diverse population.",

People look past the fact white people often want to be more tanned and would go to solariums or get spray tans. I was self conscious of my pale skin growing up and would try and get some sun so I could <b> tan.</b> This can cause skin cancer and ages skin. Should I blame this on darker skinned people or is just because it's something we ourselves as a culture came to think is more attractive for our own reasons. Why can it not be the same for asians. Just as the original commenter said people value different things and there are a lot of things I would value in the appearance of a white person that are commonly found in Asian peoples appearance and I find attractive. The same goes for Asian people. There are attributes asians appreciate amongst themselves that just so happen to be commonly found in other races. They only talked about white people in this video but I have heard asians appreciating the facial features of middle eastern, Italian, Brazilian and many other ethnicities too.",

I have never paid attention to nose bridges before in my life but I guess Asian people are wanting to attract other Asian people who feel they should have these certain features. I guess having such a homogenous society creates a very narrow definition of what is beautiful. That's too bad. I guess in that way I'm happy to be American where definition of beauty is much more open.",

I know Asian guys that get insecure about not being this big type and I'm just saying that not all women prefer that type.

I have Asian friends who obsess about their eyelids and I'm just saying from a Western perspective which doesn't have a narrow definition of beauty, all shapes are attractive.

I trust any half intelligent person can see thru your arguments. \n\nJust a last word about beauty standards. I didn't say Western stds aren't broader. What I meant was, they're not as broad as you claim. The Western world still has limited notions of beauty that they're only recently starting to change. For the most part Asians are still ridiculed as ugly and berated for their looks. The Talks Julie Chen was pressured to take plastic surgery in order to advance her career. \nWhen people make comments like the one you made, it's usually in the spirit us vs them. Us, the inherently progressive West, vs these 3rd worlders lacking the ability to question what's been passed down to them. They don't recognize that East and West exist on a spectrum. We're all moving in the same direction except some are further along than others. \n\nWith regards to Asian beauty standards, it doesn't do to generalize. I understand S. Korea has a very narrow definition. I'm not sure about China. Amongst the Asians I know, the beauty standard isn't really that strictly defined.",

For them darker skin means skin that hasn't been taken care of and they take great pride in caring for their skin. I have freckles on my body and Asians don't like that either but I've got a great figure, pretty blue eyes and long blonde hair so I'm not going to stress about it. I do try to take very good care of my skin though. I personally think dark skin is very pretty and I know many other cultures think so too. Plus, I know there are many people in Korea (I'm not familiar with other Asian countries) that think dark skin on Latin and African-descent women  is very pretty. What would be tough is to be a person from the country side in China who has had to work in the sun.  Those are the people being discriminated against and that is sad. No one deserves that.",

They are literally viewed as the most desirable asians. EAs are seen as beautiful while the rest of Asia is seen as dirty and ugly. Not only that, but they are the most privilege group of asians (and as pocs) in and out of Asia. They are seen as the \"cool asians\" and didn't have to face decades of colonialism like other Asian countries. So many people are obsessed with your facial features and culture. Lots of people wish to be East Asian, but never to be any other Asian because they are seen as unattractive.\n\n EAs get treated the best idk why EAs are always living in a bubble and are so ignorant to this. Your from China and clearly don't know how the dynamic works in Western countries. Other Asian groups face lots of racial discrimination for  their skin color. In no way whats so ever are they seen as a beauty standard. East Asians are treated much better then any other Asian group in the West. To assume that skin tone isn't a factor is VERY ignorant and show how privileged you East Asians are. Just as white people do, you East Asians look down on the other asians groups. You guys are always so oblivious to your privileges over other asians and pocs.",

The Chinese notion (or broadly east asian notion) of \"fair skin\" only means the Asian type of fair skin, which is smooth and soft. This is associated with people from higher class who work less in the fields and have whiter skin, and is not a racial concept. Don't mix it with racial issues. Chinese people from thousands of years ago already think that fair skin is more beautiful (\u80a4\u5982\u51dd\u8102\u3001\u5439\u5f39\u53ef\u7834), and that was long before they actually had contact with Europeans. In fact, the European type of whiteness was called \"devil or ghost white\" (\u7f57\u5239/\u767d\u864f) in ancient China, and was not considered beautiful at all.\n\nPlus, economic status is also a key factor. Europeans, thanks to their abilities to rob others of their wealth, established strong economies. That is currently a fact. A strong economy often projects better impressions. What we can do now is work our asses off and catch up with them. Only by working hard will we have a higher status in the world. In the future, we would all consider our asian looks to be the best.",

We are born to love money and resources, therefore rich people leave better impressions on people cuz money represents power and strength.

The preference for light skin might not have had a racial origin but it certainly translates into <b> race </b>now. In our globalized world, the current beauty std affects how we see<b>  black</b>, white and brown people and ourselves in comparison to them.\n\nI agree with your second paragraph though. The high regard for whites is partly a result of their economic status. It's not because of thei<b> r rac</b>e. White ppls economic status is the result of centuries of European colonization which has created a global structure with them at the top. This is called white privilege and it's why they're treated better wherever they go. It's not because the locals worship them, it's because more often than not, white people are at a position of advantage. Ppl often mistake white privilege for white worship, especially when it comes to E&SE Asians because E&SE Asians are already stereotyped as weak.",

And it's not like they conquered in a heroic manner either. Euros mostly did it by exploiting rivalries between local chiefs, spreading disease and in the case of China, running drugs. In the end they failed to fully colonize China anyway.\n\n\"the Greeks created the first democratic civilization\"\nNative Americans beat you to that. \n\n\"the Romans constructed the most prolific architecture of their time\"\nLol no\n\n\"European civilizations are amazing.\"\nI'm not saying you shouldn't be proud of yourself just don't do it at the expense of others. What I notice about you white supremacists is, while you whine about not being appreciated, the moment a poc expresses any admiration for white culture,youll turn around and laugh at them for white worship. But then go back to whining aboug <b> nobody </b>appreciating you. \n\nI think it's time you ppl step back and take stock at your own self esteem.

While less so for men (muscles and the general position of facial features seems to be more important when we judge a man's appearance)\nBack in the Tang dynasty, the Huji, basically Iranian fair-skinned women, were very popular among the elite men of the empires.\nI say it is not out of a self-loathing attitude, because there are very fair-skinned men/women among Asians, too. Dark skin tends to be related with heavy manual labour (because of the sun glares), which implies lower social status.",

What I meant to say was that a lot of my Chinese friends are obsessed with white people and white skin and white facial features. This is not just my particular group of friends, but a pervasive feeling among a large fraction of china's youth - this has been studied at an academic level and a few theories have emerged as to why this is, mostly relating to the Cultural Revolution and the pre-1980s period where China was pretty much isolated from the rest of the world (in short, they say that Chinese were 'dazzled' by the western world once they learned about it, and this went as far as influencing people's beauty standards to try to match western beauty). This lady seems not only completely immune to those cultural constraints, but she's radiant, smiling, confident and has good advice to give. That's all.",

Asian men are systematically discriminated against for their <b> race </b>and<b>  gender</b> yet no one cares because they still work the hardest and make the most money despite the blatant discrimination. Look at the media. I wouldn't care if Asian men weren't portrayed at all in the media, yet they do, only to portray Asian males in such a negative light. Short, nerdy, weak, emasculate. That stereotype has been pushed for decades in Western media even though I know plenty of Asian men who are over 6 feet tall, buff, masculine, and can pull girls of all races. When I was in high school, my white friend wanted to introduce me to a white girl but she declined and her reason was because I was Asian. A week later, she saw me at a football game and wanted our mutual friend to introduce me to her. See? Her perception of me was perpetuated by media yet she didn't even know what I looked like. After seeing what I looked like, she wanted to meet me.",

Very unappetising. In the ancient times people with less education had to work outside. So their skin were tanned.

I think any sensible and educated Chinese will not regard<b>  common</b> White men or Women handsome or pretty. We understand fully that likes of George Cloony and Rooney Mara can be found only in Hollywood but outside of it? We look so much better than them. Lol. We are not envious of whiteness with that of Caucasian, that is for sure. It is not gonna happen. Caucasians thinks too highly of themselves. Lol.",

Long answer:  There was an unspecified meeting among Youtube types & they said that notifications were no longer going to go out to everyone, but only to the channel's bigger or best fans.  They did not expound on that definition or the qualifications.  They apparently have made a change when you sub to a new channel.  You can choose to always be notified or occasionally notified.  But to be on the safe side, make sure your notification bell has the marks on the top right & left side of the bell which indicates 'always'",
