        "postText": "'Phillip Schofield, 57, came out in a lengthy statement posted on his Instagram story, before going on to This Morning to be interviewed by his co-host Holly Willoughby, who said I will always be by your side . In view of his 2.7 million followers, the presenter, who has two daughters with his wife of nearly 27 years, Stephanie Lowe, wrote: You never know what\u2019s going on in someone\u2019s seemingly perfect life, what issues they are struggling with, or the state of their wellbeing - and so you won\u2019t know what has been consuming me for the last few years.', 'With the strength and support of my wife and my daughters, I have been coming to terms with the fact that I am gay.', 'This is something that has caused many heart-breaking conversations at home.', 'I have been married to Steph for nearly 27 years, and we have two beautiful grown-up daughters, Molly and Ruby.', 'Phillip went on to thank his family for their kindness in spite of their confusion over the news.', 'He continued: My family have held me so close: they have tried to cheer me up, to smother me with kindness and love, despite their own confusion.', 'Yet I still can\u2019t sleep and there have been some very dark moments.', ' My inner conflict contrasts with an outside world that has changed so very much for the better. ', 'Today, quite rightly, being gay is a reason to celebrate and be proud.Yes, I am feeling pain and confusion, but that comes only from the hurt that I am causing to my family.', 'Steph has been incredible - I love her so very much.She is the kindest soul I have ever met.', 'My girls have been astonishing in their love, hugs and encouraging words of comfort.Both mine and Steph\u2019 s entire families have stunned me with their love, instant acceptance and support.', 'Of course they are worried about Steph, but I know they will scoop us both up. ', 'My friends are the best, especially Holly, who has been so kind and wise - and who has hugged me as I sobbed on her shoulder.', 'At ITV, I couldn\u2019 t hope to work with more wonderful, supportive teams. ', ' Every day on This Morning, I sit in awe of those we meet who have been so brave and open in confronting their truth - so now it\u2019 s my turn to share mine.', ' This will probably all come as something of a surprise and I understand, but only by facing this, by being honest, can I hope to find peace in my mind and a way forward.Please be kind, especially to my family.Phillip.', 'Phillip opened up about his announcement on This Morning today in a heartfelt appearance with Holly, who hugged him and assured him she would be by his side forever amid applause from the ITV team.', 'Holly asked her co - star how he was feeling about speaking out.', 'He said: It's funny because, everyone that I've spoken to have all been so supportive, so loving and caring.', 'My entire family, to a person, have grabbed us and said it 's okay, we love you, we're proud of you.With every person I tell, it gets a little lighter and a little lighter.', 'On how his wife is feeling, he replied: It's tough.But this is not something that has happened quickly.I 've had to deal with this in my head for quite some time., 'And so we've gone through this together, we've been honest and we've been open.', ' I can 't write in any statement what I feel about that woman. She is amazing. She's incredible.I have never in my life, there is nobody in my life who would have supported me the way, as a wife, the way she has supported me.She 's astonishing.', 'His co-star went on to ask why he decided to speak out today.', 'He replied: It's a good question.The thing is that.You know this has been bothering me for a very long time.I think everybody does these things at their own speed in their own time. There 's no question that it has in recent times, consumed my head and has become an issue in my head.', 'And so I got to the stage where I thought, we sit here, every day, and I'm over there and some amazingly brave, incredible person is sitting here and I 'm listening to their story and thinking, Oh my God, you're so brave.And I 'm thinking: I have to be that person.', 'All you can be is honest with yourself. And I was getting to the point where I knew I wasn't being honest with myself.I was getting to the point where I didn 't like myself very much because I wasn't being honest with myself.', 'And so, when is the right time? As a family, it is the right time.', 'Holly then quizzed Phillip about a potential new partner in the future.', 'He added: I\u2019m doing each day at a time, this has always been a slow process. There is no fast process after this.', 'Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford shared their support to the star in the studio today.', 'The married couple hugged Phillip as Holly teared up.', ' Eamonn then said to the presenter: I\u2019m disappointed in a couple of ways.', ' First of all, I heard it was a big announcement from Phillip - I thought you were going to come in and announce you had resigned and I would get the job!But that wasn\u2019 t to be. ', 'As the team laughed, Eamonn launched into his second joke, saying: And the second is...there 's this great imponderable in life that has always irritated me.', 'Britain's Got Talent and I 'm a Celebrity stars Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly said they are sending love to Phillip after he was announced he was gay.', 'In a tweet the multi-award winning presenters said: Huge respect and admiration for our friend @Schofe. Sending love to you P, and to your 3 lovely girls.', 'The tweet comes after famous faces ranging from Peter Andre to Martin Lewis have come out in support of Phil.', 'Following his annoucement, many other celebrities have flocked to social media to comment, including The Chase star Jenny Ryan.', 'She wrote on Twitter: Huge love for @Schofe and his family today.', 'This can't have been an easy statement to write, but it will be a huge weight off their shoulders - and it will open up dialogue all over the country.', 'Maybe one day it won't be so hard or painful for *anyone* to come out.'",

You see there is no need to come out as straight because that is the assumption that people will generally make about you.Whereas LGBTQ + people will generally have to come out many times throughout their lives, and each time wonder or fear the reaction and the consequences they may have to live with such as being disowned by family and friends Your crass comment, together with your minions chipping in below only goes to show why people, in this case Phillip Schofield, don 't come out.",

Either way, he's grotesque to look at, but he seems happy with the outcome, and well, I'm of the mind that so long as he doesn't hurt anyone he can mutilate himself as much as he likes and should make sure he mixes with folks who indulge his delusions if he wants to feel 'special' for doing it all.  I'm inclined to think he was already unique and had plenty of decent character traits to do something else with his life than be a perpetual attention seeker. We 're already normalising obesity, next we'll be normalising anorexia and saying the 4 stone skeletal look is just another normal body type and something to be 'proud' of .SO be it, so long as we stop wasting taxpayer funding and make free healthcare conditional on lifestyle and subject to charges if not covered.Then we can get on with taking care of genetic non self - inflicted problems and other cases of mental illness that afflict the human species.",

His poor wife will be inevitably reviewing her entire life with him, from the times they were in bed to what he was really thinking of when he touched her and when he decided he wanted men. She 'll be supportive ofc, at least for now, until as with Barrymore's wife she eventually disconnects from the sham and lies she 's been conditioned to accept out of loyalty and albeit fractured sense of belonging.

Firstly, I said I WASN 'T surprised. Secondly, actually I do know what is was like to grow up in the 60 's. Third, Schofield is in his 50 's so was just a CHILD in the 60's. Fourth, do the maths - he married 26 years ago, which is 1994, so well after as you said, homosexuality was decriminalised in the late 60 's.  Being 'openly gay ' exploded in the 80's helped by the music scene Boy George, Frankie, George Michael, Freddy.I was there too! The town where I live has been a 'gay' refuge since the 50 's. I have gay friends, including one trans and my youngest child is gay, so please, save your ignorant jibes for someone else.  My good friend told me how hard it was in the 50 's being gay, and the turning point really was the 60's and he ended up coming to where I live which he said was like a new world.He 's in his late 60's and married to a young man now I went to their wedding.He used to work on the stage for many years with many stars of the theatre / shows, many not with us now. My comments are entirely in support of Phil 's wife, and I stand by calling him arrogant and selfish. How dare he USE another person as his shield!His poor wife wasted 3 decades apparently unknowingly living HIS lie and preserving HIS 'secret' that everyone knew anyway!so he could USE her to play happy families Such arrogance and self - entitlement..",
