        "postText": " In this video, I introduce some foundational theories of nationalism and national identity. I look at primordialists like Edward Shills and Clifford Geertz and modernists including Ernest Gellner (Nations and Nationalism) and Benedict Anderson (Imagined Communities). Finally, I take a quick look at the Marxist Hobsbawm's The Invention of Tradition. . . Then & Now is FAN-FUNDED!

There are a lot of cultures and customs of the west that could be foreign to me. I wouldn't ask you to change your practices. but, with this increase globalization, people have started to take the liberty to change someone else's culture, since it differs from them.  Muslims are more conservative in thinking than anybody in the west. I don't think they are compatible and are bound to lead to conflicts. Not because they are inherently evil or anything, its just this sudden change of environment, that could just shatter their belief systems instantaneously. they react sometimes.

For example Armenian communists and anti-communists came together to fight Muslims.  Obviously prioritizing blood over ideology allowed them to defend against this evil.   The Soviet Union atrocities would not have happened if<b>  ethnic</b>\nRussians were in charge.  85% were Jewish and the rest like Lenin were mostly either half Jews or married to Jews.  Without Jews the gulags would have never occurred.  The Soviet Union only started to change when the last non-Russian - Stalin- died and Russians came into control.\n\nHeidegger makes a similar argument in Being and Time about how for the truth to be revealed the individual must be placed in the context of\na<b> n ethni</b>c group and history etc.  \nHistory has shown awareness of on<b> es ethnici</b>ty and racial\nconsciousness is the surest defense against authoritarian structures.",
