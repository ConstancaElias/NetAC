        "postText": "My partner and I were invited on Good Morning Britain yesterday to defend Girlguiding\u2019s policy that allows trans girls to participate in their activities \u2013 we immediately turned it down.', 'I said no because we are sick of debating our identities.', 'Trans people deserve to be respected for who they are and should be free to have access to the same activities and facilities as other people. This should be obvious and thereforenothing to debate.', 'Girl Guide\u2019s policy has already been in place for several years now and, despite there being no actual factual evidence that it has ever resulted in abuse, this row has yet again resurfaced.It is no surprise that those who advocate against trans rights would seize this opportunity to conflate trans people \u2014 in this instance trans girls between the age of 10 and 14 \u2014 with sexual predators.', 'What is surprising is that trans people and their families are being invited on mainstream TV to argue why young trans girls aren\u2019t potential rapists, Those with concerns claim that by allowing trans girls to join as participants \u2014 or trans women as guides \u2014 some girls and women will say they identify as female just to get into these spaces to abuse girls. Yet someone falsely claiming to be someone they\u2019re not has nothing to do with trans people.', 'The process trans people go through to be themselves is a lot more complex than claiming to be a \u2018woman on Wednesdays\u2019, as a man deciding to stand to be Basingstoke Labour party\u2019s women\u2019s officer, announced.', 'Trans people experience high levels of discrimination in society and go through tremendous stress and trouble in coming out as who they are; often risking losing their family, friends, job and even risk their own physical safety and mental well-being.', 'In addition, anyone that wanted to abuse women and girls certainly wouldn\u2019t have to pretend to be a woman in order to do that. Men already do at an alarming rate, and none of them \u2018put on a frock and make-up.\u2019Girlguiding has robust and well-established safeguarding regulations in place, and those working with them having to go through an assessment and have the proper certification and qualifications.', 'The fundamental problem with this \u2018debate\u2019 is the lack of understanding and compassion towards trans people and their lives', 'They assess every group and individual that take part in their activities, and make sure that safety procedures are met \u2013 what\u2019s more, those that have actively breached their policies and code of conduct have had their membership withdrawn.', 'Without evidence of trans girls being a risk to other girls, any of these concerns about them are based on fear and misleading narratives pushed by people who don\u2019t believe trans people should have the same fundamental rights as everyone else.', 'Masquerading it as \u2018concern\u2019 doesn\u2019t make it any more legitimate.', 'The fundamental problem with this \u2018debate\u2019 is the lack of understanding and compassion towards trans people and their lives \u2013 we\u2019ve seen these scaremongering narratives before, centered around gay and bisexual people during section 28. Trans girls certainly aren\u2019t the same as boys; they have bodies that do not fit their innate sense of self, and this causes them severe distress and anxiety. Those that are fortunate enough to get access to puberty blockers, therefore don\u2019t have to go through having their body form in ways that traumatise them.', 'However, trans girls are just like other girls, wanting to get on with life without being constantly persecuted and \u2018othered\u2019 for their difference. They want to be seen as their true selves, just like any other child.', 'Imagine being 12 years old and seeing fully grown adults arguing on TV as to why they think you could potentially be a sexual predator and shouldn\u2019t be allowed on a camping trip with your friends.', 'Advocating for the exclusion of an already vulnerable group from activities that will benefit them massively, both socially and physically, is frankly cruel and nothing but clear-cut transphobia.', 'Research tells us that trans youth are at a higher risk of discrimination and bullying, and that up to 45% of them have attempted suicide.', 'Trans kids need our support more than ever \u2013 the only abusers here are those wanting innocent children to suffer because of fictional speculation.",
