I started this channel as an extension of my humor blog I write at sometimes- www.frugalistablog.com . Thanks for joining me in all this crazy fun! ",

I just started unsubscribing like<b>  crazy</b>, and if I cant find anything worthwhile in instagram im going to uninstall that app. So many accounts are just sneak peeks of the main you tube channel, or a bunch of teen makeup pictures, like OMG create some frigging content for instagram or get off the frigging platform! Keep it fresh! Change it up every couple of weeks or months god.\n\nI like channels mostly from people close to m<b> y ag</b>e or older. My only gripe is people making boring as hell, irrelevant videos. I often want to see the information Hot and Flashy puts out there,  but the pace, delivery, content and editing is boring as hell. Just can't. I just speed through her videos IF I watch them.",

I'm not a \"make-up expert\" and I feel I represent the average consumer. I would love to see big makeup companies giving us tips and advice on make-up trends and not only the ant-aging stuff. We can be hip beautiful women too!!",

I'm so tired of these filters that make you tubers look like they're not even real people. They put on a foundation and they look flawless like they did without the foundation. I like to see how these products are really working and not by people also trying to sell them to me. I have actually been meaning to ask you if you're planning on doing a retin-a update if you're still using it? That is something I started on about 3 months ago all because of the older you tubers and I'm so happy I did! You were one of the people that convinced me to try it out and living in Canada I don't pay a penny for it! I'd love to know how it's working for you. Continue your great work!",

This is  precisely because of people like you, who represent me on YouTube, as a women over 40.  I appreciate you putting the message out there because it needs to be said.  Thank you!",

I wish there was a way to target women over 40...but that's another topic. I also wish there was a stronger over 40 YouTube community where we can support other over 40 YouTubers. :(\n\nI hear ya about cosmetic companies and advertising. Don't they realize that older women have money to spend on beauty? Probably more than early 20 somethings? It irks me too when I see 17 year <b> old </b>GIRLS modeling for a anti-aging product. And don't even get me started about<b>  thin</b> women modeling plus size fashion (my rage is real).\n\nGreat video Rebecca!",

I then branched out & I found you \ud83c\udf38also Angie hot n flashy , Wayne Goss , StephanieMarie & Nadine Baggot . I realised I had no skin routine, well because when I was younger I'd put moisturiser on & the next day be full of spots lol & I realise we have different skin but I trust in what you say & if something doesn't work it's because i could be more sensitive although you are too lol . What I'm trying to say is you are funny, you give honest reviews & I suppose we will be having similar aches & pains, generally everything heading south lol & we can laugh about it & sometimes we can be sad too it's ok. Well done with your channel I hope it grows from strength to strength my picture might change but I will always watch you \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udf38xx",

Seeing 18-24 year olds in anti-aging skin care adverts bugs the ever living crap out of me too. \n\nI love make up. Let me stress, I LOVE makeup, but what works for a 18-28 year <b> old </b>isn't necessarily going to work for me anymore.

Products that are maybe geared towards the matu<b> re wom</b>an, instead of products that are more categorized for ev<b> ery wo</b>man.  Ya know?!

I louvre the young you tubers they are so talented and their make up is stunning on their beautiful young taught skin. But that same make up will never look the same on my crepe puffy eyes and parched skin, But I do the best I can with what I have. I still love to play with different looks and like to stay on trend as much as I possibly can and will still look good on me. Also don't these companies understand that we are already established<b>  woman</b> with more money to spend especially on high end products. If you look at the comments on a lot of the young influences they are complaints of the YouTuber not using more drug store/inexpensive products. Obviously young ladies just starting out in life with smaller budgets to spend on make up. Thanks again!!!!",

I have wondered if more women in the older <b> age </b>range would buy more makeup if it was easier to find products that really look good on different varieties of more mature skin. I sense that cosmetics companies are pandering now to consumers who just buy more and more, regardless of the quality of the product. Like the disappointing holiday stuff that fewer and fewer seem to appreciate.  I'm very selective in what I will buy, but I will put out the money for an excellent, effective product. Thanks again for speaking up!!",

I have spent so much money on products that don't work for my skin type. My foundation has been a nightmare because of having combo skin and large pores. Eyeshadow has been a challenge also.  Not all of us can wear a shimmer on our lids. Thank you for you videos. I enjoy watching them and I do take away some good tips and tricks.",
