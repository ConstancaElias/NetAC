        "postText": "A diner left a note calling the waiter who had served him an entire meal a \u2018terrorist\u2019 after circling his name Khalil.', 'Khalil Cavil was working his shift at the Texas steakhouse when he noticed one of the tables he was working on had not left a tip.', 'When he went to check the table he saw the handwritten message scrawled at the top of the receipt read: \u2018We don\u2019t tip terrorist (sic)\u2019.', 'Despite the bill coming to $108.73 (\u00a384), the customer at the Saltgrass Steak House in Odessa wrote the number zero in the space left blank to fill out a tip.', 'The shocked waiter posted the offensive message to his Facebook page saying: \u2018Last night at work I received this note from one of my tables. At the moment I didn\u2019t know what to think nor what to say, I was sick to my stomach.', '\u2018I share this because I want people to understand that this racism and this hatred still exists.', '\u2018Although, this is nothing new, it is still something that will test your faith. All day I\u2019ve had to remind myself that Jesus died for these people too.', '\u2018I have decided to let this encourage me, and fuel me to change the world the only way I know how. So to all the haters out there, keep talkin, your only helping me step into my destiny! (sic)\u2019', 'His post was shared more than 20,000 times by Facebook users who were similarly disgusted with the comment.', 'Lisa Ann wrote: \u2018I am so sorry you have to deal with this BS. I and most Americans stand with you. This is so heartbreaking to see. Just remember most Americans do not feel this way.\u2019', 'Mina Ghaffar said: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry you had to experience this it makes me so sad that this form of hate exists in our world. Stay strong bro and really happy to see you\u2019ve dealt with this issue with so much grace and intelligence.\u2019', 'Some have even sent Khalil money to make up for his lack of tip after seeing the post from July 15.', 'Yesterday, Khalil wrote another status to say he would be donating the unspecified amount to his local church.', '\u2018Once again, I want to thank everyone for all of the loving support,\u2019 he wrote.', '\u2018Most of all I want to thank my family who has stood by me during this hectic week. I want to thank everyone who has messaged me over these past few days.', '\u2018There has been so much support and encouraging messages that it\u2019s been hard to keep up with all of them. But to all of the people who have sent me money I want to thank you as well.', '\u2018I want to make it very clear that this was never about the tip nor the money. It was about shedding a light on racism and sharing the love of Jesus.', '\u2018It was about igniting conversations because I believe real change happens when we start talking about the issue and acknowledging it\u2019s there. So thank you to everyone who has invested in me over these past few days.\u2019', 'COO of the steakhouse Terry Turney told USA Today the customer has now been banned.', '\u2018We stand by and support our employee,\u2019 he said.', '\u2018Racism of any form is unacceptable.\u2019",
