        "postText": " Do you ever feel like 'ageism' is the last 'ism' to be socially acceptable? I do! This is a shame, not only because stereotyping and discriminating against any group of people is wrong\u2026 but, also because the world is aging. . .

I have to admit, I paused before adding my <b> age </b>just now. It was more difficult than I thought. I really don't have a problem being 64 , it's looking 64 that I have difficulty with! I have recently joined the ' going grey gracefully ' gang and am happy with that decision. But I was in a store with my 23 year<b>  old</b> son the other day and the sales assistant asked him if I was his ' Gramma'! I didn't take it to heart though especially as she wasn't much younger than me and was rather silly, the type of person who speaks before they think. Anyway, not to worry. Thanks again Margaret for another very interesting topic. \u2764",

I do allow myself a low day or two to look back on what has been and will never be again.  I think it is ok to mourn the loss of fertility or the ability to run any more.  One of the reasons I love water aerobics so much is that I can still move, jump and dance in the water- it's my play time.   I don't give a damm what I look like in a plus size speedo bathing suit as I am dancing to Motown music in class.     I've got more time behind me than in front of me, but I am going to live it until the dance is over.",

I sat around a long time waiting for someone older than me to ask me out until my assistant told me to stop whining that no one was asking me out. He said \" I've heard several men ask you out and you say no! Don't you want to have fun?\" I was surprised and I went out with the next one who asked me out. It was fun. I realized when we put a number on anything it can be inhibiting. Younger or older. I enjoy people of all ages and I work with them. Sometimes they seem like kids...but that's because I see them making the same mistakes I did. We all learn and grow up which is exciting in itself. I finally have enough confidence to travel to Europe which I don't think I would have done when I was younger!",

If you look deeply at who is managing and who they are hiring to design ads, you will discover that the advertising agencies are people in their 30s and 40s. While talking to many of them, I learn that they still think 'retirement' is unplanned and people playing shuffleboard. They may have parents in their 60s and 70s, but they still have a very <b> old </b>fashioned notion of what it looks like to be in our 60s and 70s. The conversations are pretty comical actually.",

(please understand i never cared one bit about being in the photos, i always knew i was just a prop and he had a job to do).\n\nhe said he was only doing what his editor requested. they wanted young and fit. after overcoming the shock i became angry and hurt. wth! \n\nas we continued on our<b>  hike</b> i noticed the few people we met on the trail were all around ou<b> r ag</b>e. on so many levels this was unacceptable and my anger grew. (as he continued to photograph himself while i stood aside) were we not to be recognized as healthy, fit, older adults, active and enjoying the outdoors too? i wanted to know which magazine he meant, i planned write to them. i did do that. and never did hear back. (is a popular well known publication) last year my husband left our marriage for a much young<b> er wom</b>an. \n\nironically, as invisible he (and supposedly the magazine) made me feel, i've been asked to model for two company's this last year, now that i'm on my own. even though it's different and way out of my comfort zone to face the camera, i said yes. long silvering hair and wrinkles, made from mostly smiles now...and a growing confidence t<b> hat </b>age doesn't change my value, these are my best assets. \n\nyour message is so important. we have to believe in ourselves, at e<b> very</b> age. that's what matters most. lori x",

The expectation that retirement is a natural choice for everyone at a particula<b> r ag</b>e reinforces a false perception that our talents and contribution are no longer valuable. Far from reality. We are valuable contributors and fair exchange for our expertise and experience is not only appropriate, but is our right. Regarding the point about using 'for <b> my a</b>ge', I am guilty especially in response to pressures to look younger. I often respond ' I don't want to look 10 years younger, I want to look good for<b>  my </b>age'. When I deconstruct the message, I realize that it insidiously supp<b> orts ag</b>eism. Hence, my retort is now going to be 'I want to look and feel good'. Full stop. No 'just' or 'good enough'. Simply, elegantly, and confidently 'I want to look and feel good'. So now I'm off to put in a good day's work for a client with breaks for a walk and a yoga class. All pumped up and inspired. Thank you Margaret.",
