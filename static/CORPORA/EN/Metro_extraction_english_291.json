        "postText": "The first time I remember hearing the word \u2018gay\u2019, I was walking through my primary school hallway. A student stopped me and said my Spice World t-shirt was \u2018so gay\u2019.', 'A bunch of other students turned and laughed at me. I was mortified. A wave of shame crashed over me. As soon as I got home from school, I took my t-shirt off and threw it in the bin.', 'It took me a very long time to work through the damage done to my mental health because of anti-LGBT bullying and language, and to get to a place where I could be proud of being gay. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so troubling to hear Jeremy Clarkson using archaic stereotypes about LGBT people as a joke, like he did in a recent episode of The Grand Tour.', 'Language is so important and the words we choose to use when describing or referring to someone\u2019s identity has power. Belittling or mocking people who suffer daily discrimination because of who they are ignores the negative impact this can have on people from those communities.', 'It\u2019s incredibly painful and hurtful for anyone to hear parts of their identity being treated as a gag or comic relief', 'We also know that homophobic, biphobic and transphobic language continues to be a real issue in Britain and in our schools. The majority of LGBT pupils (86 per cent) regularly hear phrases like \u2018that\u2019s so gay\u2019 or \u2018you\u2019re so gay\u2019 in school, while almost half (46 per cent) \u2018frequently\u2019 or \u2018often\u2019 hear transphobic language, such as \u2018tranny\u2019 or \u2018he-she\u2019.', 'So when this kind of language is dressed up as \u2018banter\u2019 or \u2018jokes\u2019 that people hear on television, it further perpetuates the idea that it is acceptable. It also reinforces a damaging narrative that being LGBT is inferior or something to be ridiculed.', 'Before I had even come to terms with being gay, I learnt, in that one quick incident, that \u2018gay\u2019 was something to be made fun of, and consequently, to be ashamed of.', 'Unfortunately, this would not be the last time I was the target of such homophobic taunting growing up \u2013 and neither is it the first time the The Grand Tour presenters have made homophobic remarks. Three years ago, Richard Hammond claimed he does not eat ice cream because he\u2019s straight.', 'It\u2019s incredibly painful and hurtful for anyone to hear parts of their identity being treated as a gag or comic relief. Being lesbian, gay, bi and/or trans should never be the punchline of anyone\u2019s joke.', 'That\u2019s why the way the media represents and talks about LGBT people is such a crucial part of making the world a more accepting place.', 'Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s recent comments, and what Richard Hammond said three years ago, are just two examples that show much work is left to do to combat discrimination and the use of hateful language against lesbian, gay, bi and trans people.', 'Changing the way LGBT people are talked about on-screen can have a hugely positive impact on the way these conversations happen on school playgrounds and in the hallways.', 'If we\u2019re going to change the way people think and feel about LGBT people, we need more shows with greater and more diverse representations of LGBT people from all walks of life.",

Everyone and everything is fodder for comedy, and to deny people the right to make jokes about certain topics is to deny their right to free speech. And as that is what's given you the platform to try and dismiss their sense of humour, I don't think it's very fair for you to use it to complain that someone else is using it to make jokes. Unless they start ranting that <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>people are disgusting, men sucking other mens' dicks is wrong, etc., maybe take a breather and consider that 3 middle-aged men calling wearing pink a<b> s g<b> a</b</b>>y might be them making fun of people who still think it actually is a sign of homosexuality. And I haven't watched every episode of The Grand Tour/old Top Gear, but I will bet my last penny that one, if not all three, of them has worn a pink shirt at some point in their lives.",

But as an adult now, you get to pick and choose who you pay any mind to.You may unfortunately be one of the ignorant adults though, if you think that all of the 7ish billion people on this planet are going to speak the way you want them to speak, and think the way you want them to think.  Jeremy and Hammond are funny to me.  Let it be that, and watch what's funny to you. I really struggle to understand why in 2019 that can't be a thing anymore.",
