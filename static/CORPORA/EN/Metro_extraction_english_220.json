        "postText": "When I first came to the UK in 2005, I was shocked to see so many people of different backgrounds living together peacefully.', 'On the first day, when my uncle picked me up at Stratford station, I was crying because I was so overwhelmed.', 'Before I came here, I had never seen a black person or a woman wearing a headscarf. Suddenly, I wasn\u2019t different anymore \u2013 I could walk down the street and nobody harassed me.', 'During my first days in the country, I went into a shop and was greeted with \u2018How are you my darling?\u2019. I felt like I was in heaven.', 'There is a lot of discrimination in Slovakia where I grew up; as a Roma person I couldn\u2019t go to a restaurant or even walk outside without being scared.', 'One day, my father and I were travelling on the train in Slovakia and a group of young men grabbed him by his throat. My father has darker skin than me, so they knew he was Roma, and wanted to throw him out of the window.', 'In the UK, things were very different. I got a National Insurance number, learnt enough English to look for jobs and found work about three weeks after I arrived.', 'I just went to different hotels and offered my services as a cleaning lady. One of the first hotels I went to employed me on the same day I applied.', 'I signed a contract and started working, with colleagues from all over the world \u2013 Portugal, Brazil, Lithuania and the UK.', 'We got along very well. Nobody was better than anyone else.', 'Last year, my cousin was speaking to her daughter in our language while she was waiting for the tube and a woman attacked her.', 'That\u2019s also where I learnt English. I didn\u2019t speak a word of the language when I arrived, but had to communicate with my colleagues and so picked it up quickly.', 'When I found out that I had to apply for settled status \u2013 the new immigration status for EU citizens after Brexit \u2013 I felt scared that they would send us back to Slovakia.', 'I knew I had all the documents like payslips and bills, but I was worried about the application process.', 'I struggle with reading and writing, so it was difficult for me to fill out the form. I applied in December 2018, but I couldn\u2019t have done it without the help of a local charity that supports Roma people known as the Roma Support Group.', 'The atmosphere in the UK has changed since Brexit \u2013 it\u2019s not like it used to be.', 'About two weeks ago I was on the bus talking to my friend in our language. A man sitting behind us shouted: \u2018Why are you talking your language? You should go back home\u2019.', 'Last year, my cousin was speaking to her daughter in our language while she was waiting for the tube and a woman attacked her.', 'She said: \u2018You have no place in this country\u2019 and punched her in the face.', 'I hear so many stories like this from my family and friends and it makes me sad. I no longer speak on the phone in my own language when I get on the bus.', 'I don\u2019t know why these people don\u2019t like us. Maybe it\u2019s not even because we\u2019re Roma, but because we\u2019re European.', 'I believe that this is happening because of Brexit. In all the years that I have been working and using public transportation I have never had any issues before.', 'I never felt scared to say that I\u2019m Roma, yet now I\u2019m more hesitant.', 'Despite that, the UK is still my home.', 'My family and I came here for a better life, and we all work here.', 'Headteacher struck off for swindling school funds to pay for staff parties', 'My brother\u2019s children are five and 10 years old \u2013 they were born in the UK.', 'They only speak English, even though they have a Slovakian passport. They are so happy here; they can play in the park and they love going to school.', 'It makes me think about my own childhood and how I was scared to go to school, because I was beaten up every day.', 'When they are older, they need to know how my brother and me grew up, so they understand how different it was and how lucky they are to grow up in the UK.', 'I still hope that Brexit won\u2019t happen.', 'I want things to go back to the way they were when I felt part of a wider community in the UK, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s possible.",

Yet England was expected to cough up \u00a32 billion per year out of its own budget to pay the bribe to the DUP for voting with May's minority government. Now England is being blackmailed by the whole of Ireland because of the \"backstop\" and Ireland's PM Leo Varadkar mocks the UK to Trump at the \"Friends of Ireland\" summit. We English note, there is never a \"Friends of England\" summit or organisation. We English have no friends, but are expected to pay for everything and to be blamed for everything. This latest <b> Brexit </b>betrayal has ensured a hostile rise in English<b>  nationalism</b>, and the English will demand independence from the UK to ge<b> t Brexi</b>t. By the way, how is sitting on a bus full of foreigners, gabbling away in a multitude of foreign languages, in any way culturally uplifting? Not to mention the number of road traffic accidents, often lethal, caused by lorry drivers from eastern Europe and the Balkans?",

They need to deliver on the promise made or risk undermining the whole institution for generations to come. Can you imagine if the Empire had granted independence to it's former colonies in all but name and maintained control over it's laws, movement of people and trade? Or decided at the final hour to deny what the people of those countries had demanded? Whilst the comparisons are not identical there is enough tangibility there.I don't care however what language people speak as long as they see themselves part of this country and actually want to be. I'm glad the author of the article sees this as home, indeed significantly so that out of all the EU and European  countries she chose this one. Now is the time she stands up for it against the diatribes and globalist propaganda. If she does that then I'm sure we will stand up for her too.",

So far, it hasn't happened, but should anyone ever abuse me because of who I am or what language I speak I'll make sure they end in a trial and prosecuted for it. Other than that, I urge you to judge people individually on their real merits and actions, not on origins and background. Peace and love.",

Unless you have signs which say 'Talking loudly (in any language) is not allowed' what you are saying is illegal or <b> racist.</b> I do not like people smoking in public open places, but the law allows it so I accept it. Imagine someone is on the phone speaking to their mother (who is not in the UK), therefore no need to speak English. How about 2 lady friends talking about intimate issues, such as period? Would that be of interest to you? Just because you were lucky enough to have been born in a country where English is a 1st language it doesn't give you an entitled position. Have you heard of empathy? Well, then how do you think a bus driver in Italy, France, Greece, Spain, China and other tourist destinations feels when tourists are aboard, speaking their own language? You provide public services, it's part of your job, my dear. Accept it or if you can't, make room for those who can.",

I was insulted in the British Embassy and called very horrible names, but I managed to get back, study and a lot of British people have jobs and careers because I am very dedicated to what I do. I believe in developing people no matter of the background, but for that I started with myself and am still paying back. Now, I have no idea how aware you all are but the European Social Fund is something that helps lots of people into work, with childcare and their wellbeing, too. And guess what, 85% + of the participants are not EU nationals. Until anyone finds alternative funding, which is unlikely, without again, some vested interests, the 'British jobs for British people' slogan might suffer quite a bit. I have attended recently a Parliament debate on funding for these projects. It looks like it will take a long route before the British funding gets into education and upskilling, a long, diverted route. These monies go to fund some war projects, some corrupt politicians, some scaremongering campaigns... Oh, well, 'c' est la vie', as  Russians say...(I am fluent in French, in case anybody thinks I can't distinguish French from Russian).",

Then revolution came and corruption and poverty followed. So, I left. I couldn't stand the mentality. I am writing a book with real facts of what I had been through since coming here or even before. It will contain practical advice that I was provided for free and out of love, but I was too stubborn, a bit like Britain wanting to succeed independently. As for divorce, I don't believe in it. I used to believe in marriage till I had to break two engagements. Afterwards realised independence is not good, nor is marriage. A mutual support relationship is.

I lived &amp; worked abroad for 10 yrs ; my children were brought up abroad; it was a fantastic experience for all of us but all this insular attitude gives narrow minded people the impetus to promote hatred of any different races &amp; nationalities. My heart goes out to you \ud83d\ude30",

This London of ours, is one of the oldest immigration-led places in the world. A center of commerce for millennia, it's married people who want to work, with merchants whom wish people to work for them. 'We' start off in the basic jobs, and gradually we (or our children) progress. It's a great, symbiotic system!I grew up not seeing differences in people, just seeing differences in class. I'm a union man, MY people are those who work....in any capacity. Not defined by language, creed or colour.Just all of us, jostling along together, finding <b> common </b>sources of humour in just living<b> .Brexit</b> seems to have given permissions to sub-intelligent, sycophantic cap-doffers, who blame their personal economic circumstances on their fellow workers, rather than than the authors of their own particular miseries, the cold and empathy-less conservative party....whose  raison d'etre is to divide and rule US, the working-class.",

Nowadays I avoid as much as possible talking in my language in public transports. I just don't want any trouble and you never know who is seating next to you. If I get this sort of abuse I will no longer be able to stay. Despite having settled status and my daughter British citizenship I would never live in a country where I didn't felt welcome. It's a shame that things have changed. Now you can feel this tension hanging around even in London.",
