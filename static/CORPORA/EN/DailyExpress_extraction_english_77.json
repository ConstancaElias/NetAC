', 'In one passage cited, Mr Hargreaves characters say: I know what that naughty little lady needs.', 'Another reads: She managed to find herself the perfect job.', 'She now works for Mr Lazy!She cooks and cleans for him.', 'It is further noted that the series, aimed at children two - years - old and over, published only Mr - stories for the first ten years of their print run. ', ' The first Little Miss book was published in the 1980 s. ', ' 47 Mr Men and 34 Little Miss books, published between 1971 and 2014, were analysed in the study - and the findings were proudly presented at the British Psychological Society\u2019 s annual conference in Nottingham.', 'Egmont, the publisher of Mr Men and Little Miss books, declined to comment.'",

Whilst washing up she stared out of the window vacantly, thinking, \"What shall I do today usefully to add to the sum of human endeavour and knowledge? I know. I'll trawl the Mr Men books for <b> sexism,</b> and the world will thank me. So worthwhile. What a good person I am, to save people from such horrid books full of brainwashing stereotypes.\" In the way of PC zealots, full of their own superiority and virtue and desperate need to control other people, she overlooks the fact that stereotypes only become stereotypes because they reflect reality, and the Mr Men books simply exaggerate those characteristics.Sorry, Madeleine, but that 's the way the world is and who gave you the right to impose your own personal narrow narrative?",

I once owned a book that was a reprint of an original first written in India in the late 1800 's, it was called Little Bl\u00e1ck S\u0101mb\u00f4, see how I have to change the spelling lest I set off the moderators?!. I absolutely loved this book but I'm certain today it must be a banned book ? !I loved the story of the little boy losing his clothes & amp;winning them back from the naughty tigers who had stolen them from him!...Most of all I loved the graphics & amp;bright colours, because I was too small to be able to read at that point what with me being a Child!!!Once I started school, &amp;could read, never once did I call other friends names like \u015b\u00e1mb\u00f3 because I 'd been negatively influenced, in fact I made no connection whatsoever!! Please, leave children alone!!!You sully their innocence with your own negative take on the world!!!",
