        "postText": "'Jamie Courtney, the head of South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue, was criticised for using the words eight times when describing the importance of five-strong fire crews.', 'A unidentified member of the public objected to Mr Courtney's speech at a Rotherham Council meeting last month, saying: I felt his language was minimising the role of women in the fire service.', 'There aren't many women firefighters and it's important not to just see firefighters as men.', 'Mr Courtney made his remarks despite the brigade leading the way for women firefighters. ', 'In December last year, it appointed mother-of-one Alex Johnson as its Assistant Chief Fire Officer and last month, the force released a video highlighting female officers' contributions to the fire service to mark International Women's Day. ', ' Diana Terris, clerk to South Yorkshire Fire Authority, said she had spoken to Mr Courtney about his gender-specific speech.', 'She went on: The Chief Fire Officer is grateful for this to have been highlighted and apologises unreservedly. He would have done so without question at the time, had it been pointed out.', 'He is a great advocate of equality and diversity within the Fire and Rescue Service, a point affirmed by both the Chair and Vice Chair of the Authority.', 'Nicky Brown, the female chair of South Yorkshire's Fire Brigade Union, added: The fire service nationally and locally goes to great lengths to promote itself as an Equal Opportunities Employer and it is essential that the senior representatives of the organisation are seen to endorse this ethos. ', 'South Yorkshire has a total of 672 whole-time and retained firefighters but only 42 of these are women.', 'Last autumn, London Fire Brigade's first woman chief, Dany Cotton, declared there was no such thing as a fireman  - only firefighters.', 'She said: I want to shake off outdated language which we know is stopping girls from considering this rewarding and professional career.', 'Mr Courtney declined to comment last night.'",
