', 'We don\u2019t believe the practice is appropriate or relevant to Formula 1 and its fans, old and new, across the world.', 'The time before a race is normally a celebration, where guests and various performers can add to the glamour and spectacle of the Grand Prix and promoters and partners can showcase their countries and products.', 'The new F1 season begins on March 25 with the 2018 Formula 1 Rolex Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne.', 'The Matchroom Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn criticised the decision taken in darts and said he refuses to take the same action with ring girls.', 'He said: \u201cThe ring card girls are actually doing a job which they\u2019ve done for many, many years which is letting people know what round is coming up\u201d.', 'Formula One 's new owners Liberty Media have made various changes in terms of rebranding the sport since taking control one year ago.'",

On the one hand they say women must be allowed to do what ever job they like, then they stop Model's from working in legitimate employment.  My feeling is the feminist's are yet another unelected and dictatorial group who decide women must only do the jobs they think are suitable, and the F1 and darts organisations simply acquiesce. If a <b> woman </b>wishes to be a Model then that is their right, and no feminist activist should have the right to oppose them.Sue them for loss of earnings might help to clear their mind - including their supporter 's in Parliament!",

I bet any industry where women make more will be ignored by the sexists and it will only be where men make more that we will see being targeted for equality. I think companies may just make more excuses not to hire women, I have no problem with women being paid the same as me for doing the same job as long as if they ask for help I have the right to say no. I take it the <b> sexual </b>equality thing means women will no longer expect any preferential social etiquette. One thing I am curious about is that in a disaster where people use to say women and children first, I take it now we can just say children first and then everyone else for themselves",
