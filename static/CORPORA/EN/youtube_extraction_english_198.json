You know Nancy Pelosi is the wrong person for the job when Trump even wants her to be the speaker! That is saying a whole lot!",

Nancy Pelosi is no different than the right, pushing austerity programs and to undermine any progressive movements. That is her main job in democratic party. If people dont unite aginst her and attacking her every step of the way, then she and the rest of the neoliberal class will continue their austerity programs.  Democrats or not, are not to be reasoned with, they are all one in the same and it is evident. So whoppie and Nancy can go fuck themselves",
