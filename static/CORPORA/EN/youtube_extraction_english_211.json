I'm white and I don't want to meet someone who isn't white. \nNot because of <b> racism,</b> but when I find the one, I want her to be white so my children look like me. I wouldn't want to have children with a<b>  black</b> or Asia<b> n woma</b>n because my children wouldn't have my characteristics, I mean someone who was Persian or Argentinan/Chilean would be okay (I've had a Argentinian girlfriend before) but that would be a big concern for me if I met someone that I could spend the rest of my life with. \nI bet a lot of people only want to meet people of their sa<b> me ra</b>ce. \nI find white women the most attractive too. I don't f<b> ind bl</b>ack or south-east Asian women attractive. So having a site where I can only meet white women would be perfect! I may sign up.\nThe fact where white people meet is controversial is disgusting. \nTher<b> e is b</b>lack, Latino, Asian only sites that have no controversy, when white people want to have their ow<b> n its r</b>acist. This is a bad sign<b> .\nThat</b> woman that says that white people can't meet each other is wrong. I've had trouble finding a nice trad<b> itiona</b>l woman. And it's perfectly fine to only date within <b> your </b>own race. I only really date <b> withi</b>n my race. I would possibly be open to a Asian or Sout<b> h Amer</b>ican woman. But I don't really find certain races generally attractive, and that's fine. \nI'm perfectly fine with being friends with people of any races, I've got friends who are Chinese, Korean, Guatemalan, Fillipin<b> o, Mala</b>yan, Indian, Pakistani (one of my best friends is white/Pakistani mixed) <b> and I </b>know a black guy too. But dating and relationships is a total different thing to having friends. \nI wouldn't have any problem with <b> anyon</b>e of any race only wanting to date wi<b> thin </b>their own race. It's natural. Forcing people to dat<b> e out</b>side their race because of some modern progressive ideas of <b> everyth</b>ing being racist i<b> s just</b> foul. That woman that had a problem with is seems like she would have some far-out disg<b> ustin</b>g opinions on race. Definitely a member of the modern progressive far-left intelligentsia. \nAnyway God bless all of you, especially those who read my long comment. I hope eve<b> ryone </b>finds the man/woman of their dreams. I've got my hopes up to mee<b> t a ni</b>ce traditional woman who would like to have a family and lead a simple life w<b> ith me</b>. But finding a woman like that is a hard thing these da<b> ys! Es</b>pecially a young woman as I'm 24! \nMost women these days just want to go out on the town, do pretty degenerate things. Especially after a drink. I love a drink my self, but I hate bars and especially clubs. Proper dens of iniquity. I<b>  certa</b>inly don't want a woman who leads that kind of lifestyle<b> . A </b>lot of women jump t<b> o sex </b>way too fast too. A woman who would open her legs on the first date, and women who open their legs before your in a proper relationship are to be avoided like the plague. Where are all the nice women, with morals at?",

And no, I am not saying that white people are superior or better. Most white people are not geniuses or super-talented or anything. I am just saying that I am indifferent to this, and I find the idea of the gorgeous Caucasian aesthetic not being exterminated to be a nice one. I don't feel personally offended if some white person decides to mate with another white person. To each their own. Why is this even a story?",

It's so easy for them to say this because they are STILL BENEFITING from what their Ancestors did to our Ancestors. Why do you think White Supremacy and White Privilege STILL exist?  Look at the media, movies, magazines, marketing and advertisement. Who do you see them PROMOTING more than anyone?  They still make it seem as though being a pale face is the 'be all to end all'. Why do you see so many BM thinking of WW as a trophy and their own women as the booby prize? When in actuality, truth be told, they may be a CONSOLATION prize but BW are the GRAND PRIZE. We have survived and been through things that would have destroyed MOST of them. Like I said they are STILL BENEFITING from the pain, misery and suffering OUR Ancestors went through. They still get way more and Better OPPORTUNITIES and PRIVILEGES that they did NOT EARN, they still dominate the world, they are accurately represented in the media and movies, whereas as BP are depicted as criminals, drug addicts, trashy, etc\u2026.Think about the political arena. One <b> Black </b>President in comparison to how many White ones?  Other races don't control the Government, Federal Reserve, IRS, Congress, States, Banks, schools, or the legal system. Look into the Fortune 500 Companies and tell me who are the MAJORITY CEO's, CFO's, Presidents, etc\u2026. It's the ones who are STILL Benefiting from what was done to MY ANCESTORS. When WP see a police officer they see someone who is on THEIR side. Can BP say the same? WP have the privilege of not being judged, white kids can be outside playing with a gun and not get shot, if WP were in a time machine, they can go anywhere in time and it would be awesome for them. It is EASIER in America to be white. Do WP benefit from the color of their skin\u2026.Of course!   Why? Again, because of our Ancestors.   This is why it will NEVER be left in the past. When you see more brown, dark and<b>  black</b> skin women in the media, movies, magazines, etc. being represented ACCURATELY\u2026and I'm not talking about average looking Ebony women\u2026I'm talking about our FINEST and most GLAMOROUS Ebony women, then the healing will BEGIN. That's just a part of the RESTITUTION they OWE EW. Just because WW layup wit<b> h blac</b>k men DOES NOT mean they li<b> ke bla</b>ck women. BM are already receiving their RESTITUTION from the WW. You don't see them swinging from trees and being castrated for parading around with WW. That is their RESTITUTION.",

You just check yo<b> ur s</b>ex and then are auto matched to the oppos<b> ite </b>sex. Having a site geared toward strait people, or white people or any other majority seems redundant is my point. However, I don't think it is by default racist/homophobic/or anything else.",

Anyone who has a racial dating preference is <b> racist!</b>. Such a person also has a racial friendship preference by automatic default. Whether or not it is unconscious or not. Being white is not and can never be the same as to say, being  Korean. The history that is attached to each identity is different. One can be pro-Korean without being anti-others, for whites, such a thing is impossible. White people have condemned themselves as the enemy of humanity!.

We can't claim to have equality if white people can't have the same things as other groups.\n\nIt is perfectly OK for white people to want to only date other white people, just as it is OK for any othe<b> r rac</b>e to prefer to be with their own kind.

Unless you're going <b> to <b> f</b</b>>orce gay men to date women, Muslims to date Jews, Atheists to date Evangelicals and Blacks to date the very tiny minority of white sup<b> remaci</b>sts. Black women have a bad reputation for being loud, easily angered, and not treating men very well. These are the reaso<b> ns giv</b>en by black men for not wan<b> ting t</b>o date black women. Whitening men and women have said that when th<b> ey hav</b>e dated black women or men, the first time they were brought home to meet the family, they were pulled off to the side and essentially told that this wasn't going to work out and they didn't want any white people in their family. Asians are very serious about arranged marriages especially in India, and dating within their own culture. You can't force this type of thing, love and attraction are very pers<b> onal. Th</b>ere is nothing at all wrong with people segregating when they want to date, fall in love get married and have children. Many people are attracted to people o<b> utsid</b>e of their race and culture, but that comes naturally, not because they'<b> re told</b> they're \"racist\" if the aren't attracted to someone from another culture or different skin tone. J<b> ust like it</b>'s not homophobic for a straight man not<b>  to<b>  </b</b>>want to date a gay man, heterophobic for the opposite. Come ON, this nonsense has to end. Now.",

I can't even hate them for it, it has been beaten in their heads since they were born: OBEY, BELIEVE, DO NOT QUESTION.

Who started the leaching of homelands? White people could've stayed in the stolen lands of Europe, but they chose to pillage lands to the West for their own greedy gains in the name of the queen, Jesus, trade, gold, exploration etc etc. If white people are a minority this day in <b> age </b>it's no ones fault but their own since they have had a 1000 year head start. That's like playing Monopoly, being the bank, having boardwalk and park place 3 hotels on each property, all other players are broke so they owe you, you are still cheating and the other players finally catching up after 1000 games. Stop blaming actual minorities for your non-issues. How can you fault people who owned<b>  nothing</b>, came fro<b> m nothin</b>g, were stolen or came to stolen America with 2 pennies in their pockets hundreds of years ago and their still barely surviving ancestors for your issues in 2018?",

Asians and Africans have controlled the world for much longer time due to trading systems between them that predate the colonial era. Europe wanted to get in on this trade but they couldn't, not to mention that they were running out of land. The only white empires that came into power before the 15th century were the Romans and Greeks. Both of them were largely southern Europeans and have features that were mostly mixed with those from the Middle East and north Africa, giving them a <b> tan </b>look more<b>  ethnic</b> look rather than the pale look most northern and western Europeans had.",

The reason why those dating sites are put in place is to make it easier for those MINORITY GROUPS to find other people who relates to their specific culture or religion.

I have seen chineese, indians and many others who share what you deem as \"Eurocentric features\" that makes them indistinguishable from \"whites\".

                    "commentText": "\u200b DarthVader  Hah, so now you are using the ad-homs?  Even after having a go at the other guy for that?...typical, back flipping and hypocrisy. I have a feeling it will be your hallmark.\r\n\n\r\nEither way, lets not play coy, I work in the social science field.  I know as well as you do that the studies you are spouting are extremely small scale, rely on using specific parameters to the studies, and plenty of loaded questions in the process.  They are generally on less than 1000 people and are meaningless.  Go look at Pew or a reputable source and tell me I am wrong.  They have worldwide stats for this, so I'm not wasting time on your meaningless stats.  They are in no way applicable to a wider scale of the world let alone a larger <b> nation </b>and in fact, there are many studies, as many if not more suggesting the opposite to your little \"entirely socialisation\" argument.  It is held by a very small and select people in the field who are generally very fringe and picked up by idiots not in the field who think they know what they are talking about.  I believe you called them \"armchair ___________\", making you an armchair social scientist.\r\n\r\nThat aside, you are talking entirely about equity, not equality.  Equality would be to allow them to have their own dating sites so everyone has the same access to both multiracial and same racial groups if they like....which all exist, so problem solved... where is the inequality? oh I see, you aren't talking about equality of opportunity, you are talking about equality of OUTCOME..... that's equity, not equality....I suspected you were a sneaky<b>  communist</b>.  You see, you cannot dictate to people how they choose to express themselves, as that actually is a right, unlike your made up \"the right to love\" which is sickening in itself considering that would include people like Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Polpot, Osama Bin Ladin, etc all of which you believe have the same \"right to love\".  Love is a developed emotion similar to trust, it's earned and developed, not owed or deserved.  So explain to me, how my emotional expression is a resource that you feel you are allowed to allocate?  I mean anyone with half a brain could see the problems with what you are suggesting before even adding the layer of complexit<b> y rac</b>e brings. \r\n\r\nUsing your logic, love is a right, therefore there is a need to have enough for everyone who feels they need it.  So what happens when there is 1 single person left who wants to be single and someone who is single but wants a relationship and they are the last 2 people available?  Does the one who is not in a relationship now have to give up being single as they want to be, to provide that love and relationship to the person who feels they are missing out?  What if one is a sociopath and can't feel love, then are they meant to pretend they do?  So now add the complexities of the inherent genetic and cultural pressures to the mix and its completely unworkable because you are trying to redistribute love like some sort of fucked up relationsh<b> ip communi</b>st.  It's like you actually believe the line \"there is someone for everyone\".  Funny how I am able to express that with<b> out r</b>ace being the factor as to WHY it's a problem.  Completely shatters your idea that its racially focused, or based on inequality, inequity maybe, but inequality...not at all.  You are actually upset that even when the same opportunity is presented, the numbers still fall how they do and you want to blame us for that... it's your own shortcoming.  \r\n\r\nIf anything it has to do with culture, but that in no way implicates the whites by default either, another thing you were quick to suggest.  As mentioned earlier, to tackle this one you need to square off with the issue of Chinese and Indians preferring whites to Africans as well even without the \"eurocentric\" sphere of influence, which to do you would have to admit that it has to do with choice somewhere along the line as you can chose which culture you adopt.  This ruins your entire narrative that they are victims of circumstance, because they actually had agency in the process, unlike AC<b> TUAL ra</b>cism.\n\nIn the current climate, <b> every</b> race is taking their opportunity to have a go at whites as it is in fashion at the moment, why would the whites then want to date those people insulting them and their culture?  You are basically saying that all races can act however they want to whites and exclude them when they feel like it, and if whites then due to how they are treated decide they would like to have their own group (like every<b>  othe</b>r race is allowed <b> to) its</b> racist and discriminatory.  You reek of hypocrisy and victim complex.",

The disparity is wide it's not even comparable. I have infact perused all the stats from Pew and fully aware of the current research. Fact of the matter is, a \"<b> race\"</b> hierarchy exists, not just in US, but other non white countries where whites live, and studies has repeatedly shown it has to do with the overwhelming exposure people get while growing up from the environment, which ofcourse, is fuelled by western media/or a society that glorifies western beauty standards.\n\n\"Two studies were conducted by researchers at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) at the University of Toronto and their collaborators from the US, UK, France and China, that showed racial bias among infants.\n\n\"Following a series of studies, researchers have discovered that six- to nine-month-old infants demonstrated racial bias in favor of members of their own<b>  race</b> and bias against those of other races.\n\nThe findings are said to be a result of the overwhelming exposure infants have to their ow<b> n rac</b>e, and experts have warned it is wise to introduce children to people from a variety of races before the issues deepen.\"\n\n [LINK] \n\n [LINK] \n\nGo ahead tell me they are biased too like  any other right winger when presented with actual studies\ud83d\ude05\n\nHere's another one.\n\n\"they found that higher levels of education was associated with more positive attitudes about multiculturalism and less positive attitudes about raci<b> al sexi</b>sm.

You are pretending it explains why as if you know.\n\n\nI never said they don't date outside t<b> heir </b>race, I said when they do, they tend to pick certain ones over others, ie, personal preference.

Personal preferences CAN!!!!! come from a place of <b> racism/</b>bias, evident from the studies.\" and you pretend like that means you can assert that to any degree.  I said from the start it can be A factor, but you cant assert it as THE factor or reason.  You are trying as hard as you can to suggest that you can make that jump consistently, when it's obvious you cannot.  You really are trying hard, that's just piss weak though.  Stop trying to backtrack and admit you are wrong, it makes you look way worse.   \n\nAlso it's embarassing you used the Doll test, from 1954.  Something that did not even have a control group.  Thats pathetic and has been shot down endlessly since. \"According to Kenneth Clark's analysis, the doll studies were relevant in that they showed how racial segregation interfered with students' personality development. But Harvard law professor Lani Guinier has noted (pdf) that the Clarks' conclusions failed to consider that<b>  black</b> students with high degrees of contact with whites could very possibly have experienced even greater distress over their racial stigma than their counterparts in segregated communities. Plus, plenty of commentators have pointed out that the experiment included a small sample size and no control group.\"\n\nYeah, seems real legit.  Thats just one, I can show plenty more reasons it's a load of shit if you like.  Since you are the master social scientist here i'm sure you are aware a source from 64 years ago is hardly credible on that basis alone...\n\nStop making my points for me.  Like I said, it's cultural, not racial.  Like I said, a culture can be attached to <b> a rac</b>e (stereotyping) but<b>  a ra</b>ce doesn't HAVE to follow a certain culture, they have the agency to choose.  Something you do not give other races credit for.  The exposure experiment has to do with exposure to cultures you moron, <b> not r</b>a<b> ce.  </b>Race is skin colou<b> r and e</b>thnic background, not culture, the stigma doesn't come from the skin colour, it comes from the culture and behaviour associated with that skin colour.  You are asserting they do not have a choice again.  The only actors who can change that stigma is those within it since as I mentioned, our rights end when they begin to step on those of others, like their choice of expression...  Do I need to explain this?  It proves exactly what I'm saying.  Yes, you can get used to other cultures with more contact, doesn't mean there is an increase in meaningful relationship developed within them.  It's like saying you can get used to living with one kidney.  Sure, is it preferable, to death, yes, to two kidneys, no.  These fail to have any prediction power as they are short term, another thing I already mentioned, so you cannot predict based off of them, any REAL social scientist would understand that, it's estimations...  \n\n\"It's called \"exposure effect\" and it's currently in line with the rise in interracial marriages with the rise in multiculturalism. The more people get exposed to it, the more likelihood of being open to it.\".... so explain white flight.... the mass migration of whites from certain areas the more multicultural they become, because it also correlates with an increase of crime.  The reason is again n<b> ot th</b>e race of the people, its the change in culture they bring... what is so hard to grasp?  \n\nAlso \"A conscious lack of attraction toward a whole racial group of people is just a polite, thinly veiled <b> form of</b> racism.

Anyone can disagree with any study saying these variables do effect, but unless they prove it, their opinion holds no merit. There's a reason why his studies were taken into consideration by the U.S supreme Court that determined racial segregation was unconstitutional. His work was not only recognized by supreme Court but many other institutions who bestowed him with honorary titles.\n\nAnd Lani's critique on the \"level of distress <b> black </b>students experience with higher contact with whites\" completely overlooks the varying levels of power both groups hold in society.

Because having been segregated for so long and coming into contact with a group that holds the institutional, structural and social advantage, distress is inevitable but as time goes on, racial tensions lessen, as evidenced by the recent studies showing how<b>  race</b> relations are perceived more positively as a society becomes more multicultural.\n\nWhile cultural differences do shape ones preferences, the root cause, however, starts from the moment they are born, as evidenced by the recent studies with babies showing that their biases were shaped even before they became mature enough to differentiate cultural differences between groups( or are you suggesting 4 month<b> s ol</b>d are smart enough to recognize cultural differences in other 4 mon<b> th o</b>ld babies too?)\n\n\"The findings are said to be a result of the overwhelming exposure infants have to their <b> own r</b>ace, and experts have warned it is wise to introduce children to people from a variety of races before the issues deepen.\"\n\nThat alone rebutts your argument that it's about culture and not skin color and other features.",

Racis</b>m is about power plus prejudice. Whites always had the structural, political and social advantage( to some degree even today) that they were barely represented in medi<b> a. Raci</b>sm becomes a social disease when it systematically places <b> one r</b>ace at the top of a hierarchy at the expense of other races. That is why the N-word stings so much more than any word blacks ever coined to denigrate white people. It's why blackface hurts in a way that whiteface doesn't. There are centuries of brutal history to back up the sting.\n\nIt's as absurd as you asking why we don't have straight parades while the<b> re'<b> s <<b> /b</b</b>>>LGBT parades. Because Straight people aren't a marginalised group as comp<b> are<b> d <<b> /b</b</b>>>to LGBT group.\n\n\"In <b> Hollywo</b>od, racism has historically worked in favor of white actors. They rule the hierarchy. Peele's dedication to a different cause may cost a few white actors leading roles, but it's a twist made necessary by a caste system created by whites to benefit whites.\n<b> \nThat'</b>s why black entertainers deserve the BET Awards and the NAACP Image Awar<b> ds. It</b>'s why black music producers create hip-hop and <b> R&B. I</b>t's why black<b>  autho</b>rs write black liter<b> ature.</b> It's why black p<b> ublish</b>ers launch black magazines. In an entertainment industry controlled largely by straight white men, minorities and other underrepresented groups, like women, need to celebrate themselves or risk going unrecognized.\n\nThe reason why the<b>  curre</b>nt surge in black directors is so important is because they f<b> inally</b> are telling black stories rather than leaving it up to white directors who, when they get around to telling them, rarely seem to get it quite right. (See the recent outrage over Peter Farrelly's 'Green Book.') Blacks were overlooked for so long in Hollywood, and now that they've finally started making their own opportunities, they shouldn't feel obligated to share their newfound wealth with actors who have historically had a surplus of opportunity\"\n\n [LINK] \n\nI have rebutted every single argument of yours with studies but you on the other hand still haven't produced any cogent studies nor argument to back your own politically motivated narrative. \n\nTry harder.",

What's key is acknowledging that bias. \n\nJust saying \"It's MuH PrefErEnCeS\" is a cop out and dogmatic perspective. \n\nReflection, reasoning and questioning can force us to see things which we did not see before, change our perceptions and even our feelings. It is through questionings like this that people became aware and conscious of slavery, women oppression etc, and it was accepting things at face value which turned ordinary Germans into mass murderers.\n\nAlso, I did rebut every ill informed argument he made with actual studies, you, just like him, haven't made any cogent argument backed up with studies so far besides your pathetic attempts at ad hominems.",

                    "commentText": "@DarthVader \nI will start by contesting the idea that segregation is worse than before. There most definitely is undeniable cases of systemic oppression but in no way can that be compared to days of slavery or even precivil rights. With that said let's get back to the arguement at hand. \n\nUnder your logic in a perfect world everyone in the world, or even just the US for that matter, should use a single dating website. The reason this doesn't happen and why blacks have their own and is ok to you is bc we make it hard for them. But tell me if all the white people are being taken bc that is the preferred beauty standard then wouldnt that only leave POC. This then in essence would then become a <b> black </b>only website with the added bonus of leaving an opportunity for multicultural mingling. The only way to then justify<b>  race</b> specific sites is though physical prefrences which I'm okay with. If you dont say that's fine then you would have to admit that those sites are more exclusionary than an all inclusive site and therefor<b> e racis</b>t. \n\nI will concede th<b> at sexu</b>al orientation is innate and will meet you on the idea that prefrences with<b>  in sex</b>ual orientation is different.  Again I will brin<b> g up</b> age as I do not believe it is as irrelevant to this argument as you wish it was. For starter<b> s th</b>e age of consent as well a<b> s wh</b>at age range is usually sought after is culturally based. Tho I too say I dont care who you date as long as its between consenting adults. The reason being that I dont care what physical prefrences you have as long as its between consenting adults. Whethe<b> r it</b> be age, height, eye color, amount of hair<b>  or e</b>ven race. On any of these traits I think you have a right to decide what you prefer and make choices based off that. Even if that preference comes from a cultural background. To add to this arguem<b> ent it </b>is common people to look for a partner that is similar to them. Whether that be physically, personality wise, culturally or any other means in which to compare. \n\nNext onto you point of stereotyping. So far I believe you are the only one holding any preconceptions as even under your definition of stereotyping I have yet to assume one personality trait or behavior associated with bein<b> g whit</b>e or black. Only saying that physical attraction is a thing and because this is different for everyone we have no right to judge their prefrences or tell them they are wrong for having them. If you are a good person then you will make friends despite physical characteristics (this works both fo<b> r whit</b>e and black individuals) but a romantic relationship also holds physical interests which is usually how you distinguish between a friends/family and a person you are dating. This again is why we should respect a person's free choice on this aspect of their life. Also to make clear there is a huge difference between this and an employer or college admissions actually discriminating. For one the example you gave does stereotype and is not an isolation on an individuals thought on another individuals physical appearance as is the case when considering attractiveness in dating. Also as mentioned before the physical aspect plays into a romantic relationship but physical appearance does not impact the merit of an individual and as such should not be considered by employers or admissions. This has been seen in court rulings in the effort to increase equality between the races. \n\nIn addition you dir<b> ectly a</b>ssert racist hold this Imply<b> ing tha</b>t only racist hold this view but <b> both w</b>hite and black, male and female tend to date and have a preference <b> for d</b>ating same race.

There most definitely is undeniable cases of systemic oppression but in no way can that be compared to days of slavery or even precivil rights\"\n\nNo. White activists have always fought diligently to have segregated white schools and it's getting worse. So, we are going backwards instead of moving forward.\n\n\", as well as greater rates of integrated schools for all students, up until the 1980s. But starting in the 1990s, segregation levels once again began to increase, as a different series of Supreme Court rulings terminated or reversed hundreds of desegregation orders across the country.\n\nThe report defines intensely segregated schools as those where less than 10 percent of the student body is white, and the percentage of these intensely segregated schools increased from 6% in 1988 to 18% in 2016\"\n\nhttps://www.bustle.com/p/statistics-on-school-segregation-over-the-years-suggest-its-actually-getting-worse-17865938\n\n\n\"Desegregation can still prompt angry, violent, white backlash. Today, Rooks reports, affluent white districts will sue and prosecute poor people of color who try to access the resources in better districts. In 2014, for example, Tanya McDowell, who was homeless, was sentenced to multiple years in prison for using the address of her babysitter to send her kindergartner to school in the affluent district of Norwalk, Connecticut.\n\nWhen I wrote an article earlier this year arguing that white parents need to do more to promote desegregation, my social media mentions filled up with outraged protests, many of them openly anti-Semitic. Rod Dreher at the American Conservative said that by pointing out that white parents are complicit in segregation, I had contributed to the \"demonization of 'whiteness.'\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/think/amp/ncna978446",

Justify then why would whites need a different site exclusively for them when they still get the most matches?\n\n\"This then in essence would then become a <b> black </b>only website with the added bonus of leaving an opportunity for multicultural mingling\"\n\nHow is this an argument against<b>  race</b> exclusive site? If the platform provides an opportunity for \"multicultural mingling\", then that's enough reason why there shouldn't be white exclusive sites.\n\n\"The only way to then justif<b> y rac</b>e specific sites is though physical prefrences which I'm okay with\"\n\nAgain, still not a logical justification. Especially when ya\"ll still pick the people with white features anyway regardless of exclusionary or inclusive.\n\n\"If you dont say that's fine then you would have to admit that those sites are more exclusionary than an all inclusive site and therefo<b> re raci</b>st.\"\n\nNon sequitur. Your argument doesn't follow from the previous statement. Any site that excludes people based<b>  on r</b<b> >ace/ethni</b>city/their physical characteristi<b> cs is r</b>acist. No amo<b> unt of </b>mental gymnastics is going to refute this fact regardless of whether inclusive si<b> tes are</b> racist or not. The fact that they get the least matches obviously has an el<b> ement o</b>f racism at play, but since they still get an opportunity for multicultural mingling, that's enough reason to provide them a space, not make it harder by excluding them completely. That'll only mak<b> e it mo</b>re racist than the inclusi<b> ve o</b>nes<b> . \n\nAge </b>has nothing to do in our d<b> iscussi</b>on of racist preferences. For one, there's wide range of preferences for all kind of ages( as long as they aren't too <b> youn</b>g nor too old), and aren'<b> t as </b>narrow as race preferences. It's the reason why<b>  you do</b>n't hear Ageism in me<b> dia as </b>severe <b> as raci</b>sm because Ageism only comes int<b> o th</b>e picture when age becomes significant enough to be dis<b> crimina</b>ted, whereas racism affects every non whites<b>  reg</b>ardless of their age. Apples to oranges.\n\nNext onto my point of stereotyping. I have experimented with enough dating profiles to know stereotyping is a thing, more so subconscious than conscious one that dominates over the physical aspect. For example - I had a friend who was Middle Eastern, he consistently used to get matches because of his \"white features\" but the moment women( especially white women), get to know he's middle eastern origin, they block/unmatch him immediately. This is no one incident, I've experimented with several profiles varying different features of one's profile to know the level of stereotyping that exists. This is a FACT.\n\nMy employer analogy is no different here. In both cases, the said person was discriminating based on stereo<b> types asso</b>ciated with ethnicity( which to some extend can be discerned from physical appearances). This is exactly the reason why minorities change their name to a white sounding name to avoid discrimination. It's a real thing. I've noticed the same effects when I changed my name to white name on daring sites. You see, there are so many variables at play besides the physical.\n\nOn the last part, Multiple studies have shown a strong correlatio<b> n with </b>people who hold racist views/bias with racial preferences. This is an irrefutable fact. It has also been shown it is mainly growing up in a society that prioritises white beauty standards as the benchmark of attractiveness. That's a FACT.",

Bottomline as human beings you have the right to date who you are attracted too. Let me be clear I don't condone the choice of words from the founders of this site I do condone the right of people looking for partners who fit their criteria of who they want to date. Hell I can choose what hotel I want to sleep in and if I choose Hilton over the Holiday Inn who gives a damn. Bottomline is we choose what we want because it makes us comfortable stop all this other bullshit. Now I will say again that u shouldn't be out here calling peo<b> ple colo</b>red because the optics of that just shows how dated and lost u are so while I dont agree with the people doing it I do understand the premise of what they are doing. Plus based on the video it seems like ole girl might have some insecurities about her husband dipping in the coffee before and is projecting that shit. As any married man knows you need peace at home so let's make her happy. Hence start a website that shows her I am only about what she wants. Also before the trolls start I am an educ<b> ated b</b>lack man who lov<b> es my </b>black wife and welcomes any meaningful debate",

Most whites do not actually come from the Caucasus region or Europe. Caucasus people include Asian (including India, which is a country of people with dark skin - unless you're considering them \"Caucasian\"), <b> African,</b> Arabic and Russian (and no, not all Russians are white/blonde/blue eyes). Have you ever seen a photo of someone from Mongolia? Many blonde hair/blue eyes/white skinned people there - are you calling them white?\n\nWhy would you ask light skinned people to \"go back\" to a place we've didn't come from and have no connection with? Unless you're also saying all blacks should go back to Africa, but not northern Africa and all American Indians should go back to Asia? Stupid ignorant racists like you are the main problem with society.",

First of, we all orginated from Africa and forcefully segregated ourselves to different places to adopt a few differences, even then we haven't been long enough to adopt significant changes to classify one group as a different species. Speciation hasn't taken place yet through genetic isolation for<b>  race</b>/species to exist. The \"exclusivity\" you're championing for, is based on these superficial physical differences which should serve no logical reason for segregation.\n\nYou folks then invaded and pillaged throughout the whole world exerting your influence, advertising how superior and attractive of a<b>  \"rac</b>e\" you are and the whole world started believing your lies for quite some time. Recent studies have shown bias towards someone who looks like them is because of the overwhelming exposure they get from their surroundings, which here was a consequence of white exclusive segregated regions all these years.\n\n\"Following a series of studies, researchers have discovered that six- to nine-month-old infants demonstrated racial bias in favor of members of their o<b> wn ra</b>ce and bias against those of other races.\n\nThe findings are said to be a result of the overwhelming exposure infants have to their <b> own r</b>ace, and experts have warned it is wise to introduce children to people from a variety of races before the issues deepen.\"\n\n [LINK] \n\n [LINK] \n\nSee? The more you segregate yourself, the more likelihood for animosity to develop between groups, the more you'd see others different and \"not one of us\" eventhough we all are technically humans. This is hard evidence why we need more diversity/inclusivity to reverse the damage that was already caused through segregation all these years. Exposure effect in action.\n\nForced segregation is NOT the same as forced diversity because while the former has likelihood to create more tensions and  negative stereotypes between groups, the latter closes the gap by familiarising people from each group. \n\nHow absurd would it be if you keep believing \"X food is the most delicious food for me\" and hesitates to eat something else recommended to you, without even tasting it a few times? Sometimes, the taste of the food or a music you hear grows on you with time.\n\nYou can argue that music/food doesn't have free will so it doesn't become an issue , but the issue is your decisions can indirectly impact others lives living in society. No matter how much you want to believe otherwise, we are all indirectly depended on each other in a society. Society functions best as collective. If you become too independent and selfish, it'll only create major imbalances in societal structure leading to its downfall. MGTOW, feminism, incels all are consequences of an imbalanced societal structure. The less we start caring about others issues, more and more problems further ensues. As a progressive society, it should cater to the concerns of everyone contributing equally to the society. That's how you maintain harmony and peace in a society.",

Regardless, whites have axiomatically given a net benefit to the world through the highest living standards ever created, they're the reason why you aren't stagnating in your bug infested shithole countries dying from every conceivable STD on the planet. Whites will give back wealth as soon as non-whites give back wealth, when the arabs give back the wealth they plundered from Spain and sicily.

Did atheist and Muslim people  complained about that website \"Christian mingle\"? So I don't understand why this one is an issue?  I know there are many other real social problems to discuss but this isn't one of them.",

The personalities are due to varying degrees of <b> mental </b>retardation. All dogs come from the same exact animal. They're just all genetically fucked up. Humans do not have breeds because we were not bred for certain characteristics. There are no human 'subspecies,' like seen in other animals. There are only humans. You are trying to argue against literally every credible scholar in this field. \n\n'Generally, when it is used it is effectively a synonym of subspecies.[64] (For animals, the only taxonomic unit below the species level is usually the subspecies;[65] there are narrower infraspecific ranks in botany, and<b>  race</b> does not correspond directly with any of them.) Traditionally, subspecies are seen as geographically isolated and genetically differentiated populations.[66] Studies of human genetic variation show that human populations are not geographically isolated,[67] and their genetic differences are far smaller than those among comparable subspecies.[68]'",

Maybe if they didn't get high off their own farts they might have lasted longer.

Meanwhile Africa descended into chaos until the British, French and Germans colonized a lot of it. Bringing infrastructure and stability. And what happened when they left? A return of chaos.

I am a white male outside USA and my preference would be towards white females.  I do not understand why whites are discriminated against in general.\n\nIf I buy one brand of car, based on a number of factors, I would not be discriminating against other brands like Ford over Chevy or Kia over Rolls Royce. I would be exercising a preference and well thought through decision. For buying a car things like price, quality, affordability and local support would be key for me to suit my needs and lifestyle.  And I do not expect to find a Chevy in a Ford dealership, let alone ranting at the Ford dealership for it!  That is just <b> crazy.</b>\n\nLikewise, I am sure other ethnicities and nationalities would offer women with characteristics which would meet most of my preferences as well. But it would add complexities too with religious and cultural differences. While I appreciate that some people manage to find solutions to these natural boundaries, and even prefer the adventure of doing so, I do not.  Hence I want the<b>  race</b> filter on dating sites which by the way does not always work properly across a number of them.\n\nI welcome a dating site where whites have preference.  If one do not like it go to the myriad of dating sites that offer th<b> e rac</b>e <b> or nationali</b>ty of your choice, or the sites offering a mixed experience.\n\nIt is OK to be white.  Just like it is OK to be any ot<b> her r</b>ace.",

They've created a double standard to try to force a victim mentality onto people of color which is wrong and immoral and white liberals are the ones who seem to enforce it so they can rule over and control others....There will never be equality of the races until people in private can freely associate with whom they choose.....    All the races are equal so there should be no double standards at all....",

Oh and for the record. I asked you to justify the things you said and instead what i got was you assuming the moral high ground when you dont have it and then calling me a creepy without justifications and <b> racist </b>who either needed an MRI or a therapist. So no you didnt explain anything. Then you completely skip over my response to hit me with your Shakespeare esque post but as I said. SJW's will cry as sure as the sin will rise.",

There'<b> s nothin</b>g racists about it in my opinion considering how many other different dating sites is geared towards specific ethnicities. \n\nI don't believe the ter<b> m 'ra</b>ce classification'. There's no such thing among the family of nation's flags. Those flags represent different nationalities including <b> the<b>  </b</b>>Red Flag with the Green 5 point star. The moors(muurs) flag that give them rights that protect them in this country. Which is what most awa<b> kened Af</b>rican Americans have adapted, after denouncing their ties to a color and a name that doesn't hold any value or protect them in this country. <b> \n\nOnl</b>y race is the <b> hue'm</b>an race. Anything else refer<b> enced</b> as race is a construct of the supreme courts. Just like the term Caucasian which they also adapted. No such<b>  thing</b> as black and white, which is 2 of many colors in a crayon box. Look at your own pigment and the answer is clear as day. I digress, but people are entitled to have a preference. \n\nI like all types of women.

There's almost 200 million people in Nigeria, over 371 (if I'm not mistaken) tribes and over 520 different dialects. They all retain their respective cultural traditions that identify them. Most <b> African </b>Americans are Natives to this land and have an identity. They just don't know which one they belong too! Some are mixed with their cousins the Africans and others are mixed with Europeans and the Africans. Some are pure native and you can see it in their features. The Washitaw(Washetaw) and Amirands were but 2 of them out of the 5,000,000+ that were here long before the colonialists settled here and brought the small portion of Africans to these very lands.

My point is that yes life here for <b> African </b>Americans is fucked up because of the history of slavery but also life for a lot of Africans in Africa is fucked up because of the history of colonization in Africa. More recently places in Africa have been going thru a lot more than what we currently face in America.

The fact that most dating sites have a racial preference functionality shows that it isn't an issue.\n\nIncorrect \"whites\" can do all those things. That doesn't mean you/\"they\" are entitled to  immunity from the social ramifications of such activities. At one point \"blacks\" \"couldn't\" do those things as well. It didn't stop them even when it was literally illegal. Look my point is you can call your boss a POS it is your prerogative whether or not you get fired for it is your bosses. Whether or not your labeled as a <b> racist </b>or whatever all depends on the observer, but there is literally<b>  nothing</b> stoping you.\n\nYou misunderstood. People who ar<b> e racis</b>t against whites are creating reason why people should care about this. Trust me no one really does except for a handful <b> of raci</b>st.\n\nThis is clearly a none issue. The billboard being removed would be the only thing we might need to talk about. It's harmless in and of itself.\n\nYou're all in a huff just like they seemingly wanted, because this has been a none issue until now suddenly people care.

Match.com, Eharmony are the largest dating sites. Most of the people on these siites are WHITE! look it up.  So there is no point  having a white only site when Match.com, Eharmony and rest are already more than 60% white!!  The reason you have Jewish singles, muslim singles,<b>  Black</b> singles and all these other small group sites cause these people are in the minority. There population is isnt much. It will be like people who can walk getting upset that there is a dating site just for crippled people and then someone decides there will be  a dating site only for people who can walk!

Even if we all blended we would still have in group preferences due to human nature being very tribalistic. Don't believe me? Just look at Africa (or even Europe in the past), wherein people of the same color savagely hate on each other for small differences, even leading up to literal genocides within the same racial group. Simply blending will not cease hatred. Following principles and ideals of respect will help, so will understanding. And understanding that people prefer their own will certainly help with this. We couldn't even interbreed if we wanted. Just ask any <b> black </b>man how half of the females in his family would react if he dated a white<b>  woman</b>. Same goes for about 25% if the white community, and the same is especially true in the Latino and Asian communities.",

            "commentText": "I think it's normal for people to have biases; especially, when it comes to choices for romantic partners. <b> Nobody </b>can or should force people to date the people they don't fancy. However, you should question why you find some people attractive and others not, especially when the source of attraction isn't based on a person's characters but a person's<b>  race</b>. If you look at what is considered beautiful for both male and female, the standard of beauty is people with Caucasian physical features. For proof, see people on TV, movies, magazines, billboards, etc., you'll see mostly white people, and life imitates arts. There is a long tradition in media to discriminate against people of color--I haven't seen an Asian man in a leading-roled superheroes yet, and I'm sill waiting. Although I'm very happy to see <b> a blac</b>k male lead for the latest Star Wars. As a result, people who consume mass media bought into t<b> he raci</b>sm perpetuated by the media, believing the standard of beauty spoon fed by the media. It is not a simple case<b>  of colo</b>red drinking fountain or bathroom anymore. This is 2<b> 018; ra</b>cism is a lot more subtle. It may seem like \"preference\", but it is in<b>  fact r</b>acism when you exclude a<b>  whol</b>e race from your consideration. That said, you will and should date who you want to date. However, I would challenge you to intentionally look for beauty in people of the races you may have judged as unattractive. You don't need to date or even talk to them. You just have to look for beauty in them. Chances are you will find some people<b>  of t</b>he race attractive--it is impossible to find all peopl<b> e of </b>the race attractive, eve<b> n for</b> the race of your preference. You should make up your own preference and don't allow other people, especially the media, to influence you in such an important choice of your life like people you date or marry because I don't believe the media industry have your interests at heart. Besides, when you see more beauty in the world, you are the one who benefits from seeing all the beauty.",

What is wrong with this picture?\n\nBlacks feeling so entitled that they can't even be cool with SOME whites wanting to just date their own <b> race?</b>\n\nThey do not have to want us.  Feelings cannot be legislated.\nNot everyone is<b>  race</b> curious.\n\nDo those who complain step back and see how hypocritical  and trifling it is to expect infiltration and acceptance 24/7???\n\n  White people  should not have to defend wanting some down time with just themselves.\n\nWe want it.  Ya'll know you feel some type of way when white people show up at your church or clubs.\n\n   (What they doing here?  Lawd, can't blacks have anything without white people sniffin up behind us)  yeah.  And some of them feel the same way about us.\n\nWhy is that a problem?\n\nDo any of you know how annoying it is to be hit up by people outside you<b> r rac</b>e over and over but you have no interest?\n\nFr<b> om a</b>ge 11 to present (almost 60) I have been a white male magnet.\n\nNo matter where I go or the decade, white men wanted to date me and came at me l<b> ike cr</b>azy. \n\nEven to this day,  If I make the mistake of smiling and talking to a white guy for over 5 minutes, I stand a good chance of either getting asked out or told how they wish they could ask me out.  Flattering at times now but also Afuckingnoying.\n\nFor years, I never dated outsid<b> e my </b>race and did not want to.\n\nI was very pretty.  I got asked on dates at least 1 per day, often 3-5 times a day.\n\nAny time I stepped out of the house.\n\nThat is NOT  fun or complimentary.\n\n  It vacillated between extremely annoying and scary.\n\nI never have used a dating site.  But if I did and despite my preferences, nonpreferences kept inboxing me, I would feel pissed AND harassed. \n\nDid it EVER occur to minorities that just like they need a break from white  interaction, rules and dominance,  some whites  need a break too.?\n\nIf a <b> white </b>woman is seeking a white male, she should NOT have to put up with minority men cramming her box with invites.\n\nThe fact she goes to a white site says it all: her PREFERENCE are white men.\n\nSame with white men.\n\nTh<b> ere is N</b>OTHING that says whites no longer have the same rights as other races.\n\nThey should not have to share space 24/7 or have to date, fuck or breed with blacks or anyone else.\n\nCan they have ANYTHING at all to themselves?\n\nMost ethnicities have their own customs, dating groups etc.  We force whites to blend, share, accept but we still keep our hoods, ch<b> urches</b>, black pride events, etc.\n\nCongrats white people.  This site is an excellent idea.  If you want to stop the feeding frenzy by minorities, go to this site.\n\nEnjoy each other..no more having to watch whatever you say or do because it is not PC this week.\n\nAs for blacks, hispanics or Asians.  If ever the  white folks who date t<b> heir </b>own race EVER wants some Minority ass, they know where you are.\n\nEverybody needs <b> a break.</b>  Nothing wrong with a place to themselves.\n\nAlso, this dating site should have a filter, if a nonwhite tries to hit up a white person, <b> BLOCK I</b>T.\n\nNobody should have to field calls or emails from groups they are not interested in and no, whites do NOT have t<b> o want</b> your black ass.\n<b> \nIt is </b>not a racist thing, it is an aesthetic preference!!!",

Why not?  My penis doesn't discriminate.  If you're gonna get mad at this website because it promote<b> s racis</b>m then you have to be EQUALLY angry at ANY dating site that is similar, of which there are many.  And maybe you should be angry?  But then again maybe we should just be honest for once and admit that whenever we choose someone to date we are all being INCREDIBLY discriminatory and th<b> at ra</b>ce is almost always a factor for everyone to varying degrees.  We discriminate about every single aspect of that person.  We discriminate against beauty, intelligence, kindness, beauty, religion, beauty, how close someone lives to you, whether they have a good job, beauty, ok . . . so it mostly comes down to whether or not we want to fuck them.  And once again we have to be honest and admit that certain characteristics that people have are almost universally unattractive and those people will almost certainly live and die completely alone, we are all to blame, and that situation is incredibly cruel and unfair . . . but not so cruel as to actually be willing to fuck those people because . . . yuck!  Bottom line, people are absolutely horrible and everything we do is completely meaningless and only serves to perpetuate an endless cycle of human misery and suffering so . . . I guess just give up completely and watch the inevitable collapse of civilization? lo<b> l.  Rac</b>ism could completely end VERY quickly.  It is LITERALLY a problem we could fuck our way out of.  I am always ready to do my part.  Given that our species is mostly driven by fe<b> male se</b>xual selection . . . I blame the ladies for apparently being so incredibly discriminator<b> y and r</b>acist.  We're all just a bunch of penises floating in empty space thrusting in infinite directions.",

That's a pretty rude comment/assumption, but I will give you the benefit of just being native and possibly young....maybe a touch immature. Maybe you thought you were being funny?

This is why people of all backgrounds like to live within communities that demographically speaking represent themselves. People are tribal creatures, thus we are best suited for getting along with people that look like ourselves, talk like ourselves, share the same cultural traits and traditions. I completely respect your opinion but I don't think it's quite right. I will say that you are right that one should be careful about who they marry and not just shack up and dedicate the rest of their lives with whoever comes along first, I know plenty of people who've made that mistake with hideous results, but keep in mind that this is a dating site that filters personal traits like political interests, career fields, life goals and even favorite foods and music choices.",

I love how Blacks portray Whites as always seeming to have a <b> racist </b>agenda.  You actually stated in your pitiful commentary above: \"The people who started the white people site did so JUST to declare they can.\"  So?  Other than YOU, JL J, who really cares if White people ONLY want to meet other White people??  I could care less about<b>  Black</b> dating sites.  If you ONLY want to date Whites, join an only-White dating site.  Since Blacks already have the monopoly o<b> n Blac</b>k this a<b> nd Bla</b>ck that, it's refreshing to see a little EQUALITY in the White man's Freedom of Choice.  You Blacks <b> see rac</b>ism in EVERYTHING because you choose to create false narratives most of the time.  (Remember the discredited narrative about Hands up!  Don't shoot!?!?!)  If you are an American citizen, perhaps you should try educating yourself by reading the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.  You might learn something from these documents.",

            "commentText": "As a white dude, I have to admit I find it difficult to navigate the dating scene in terms of racial preferences and such. Like, on one hand, I have dated men of multiple races, from white to <b> Indian </b>to<b>  African</b> American and Latino. In that, racial issues where I don't necessarily understand their experiences as men of color in America have occasionally popped up. While I have never not dated someone because of thei<b> r rac</b>e, I have to be aware that they can't come to me, talk about their experiences that day in that sense and have me understand it the way a person of color would be able to understand it. Similarly, cultural differences between my suburban white experience and their experiences have led to miscommunications. I personally am willing to put in that work and understand those experiences and try to be there for that person, but you can't expect everyone to do that. Similarly, people of other races do have these \"<b> my ra</b>ce only\" dating sites and thats permitted, often because they want to date someone who has similar cultural experiences to them. I don't think its a problem for white people to do the same thing. While I personally wouldn't care enough that my SO is of a cert<b> ain r</b>ace to make a profile on any website dedicated to <b> that </b>race exclusively, I think that other people having those perferences is perfectly fine.",

Especially in this day in <b> age.</b> I think they could have named it \"where Caucasians meet\" or \" pick your preference dating world\" i don't have good ideas for naming but you get my point! \"Where white people meet\" is just ridiculous, but guess they were going for shock value. They knew they were gonna upset people with this so WHY do it for f$@ks sake?! Let's keep adding fuel to the fire when it's unnecessary they could have went in so many other directions with the \"white people meet\" site, even tho they conveniently claim that all races can join the site.....interestingly saving their asses lol",

Not only did we set the slaves free and ban the act of owning another human being, but we revolutionized that very idea, that slavery was wrong. Whites in America did that, we were THEE first people ever to do that. And we made it an acceptable idea at that, that slavery was wrong. I get so tired of hearing people spew falsities and propaganda about how the whites in America were the absolute worst when it came to treating other people, when in comparison for the times, America was the safest place that people could live together. Granted yes, we did have segregation and such, but that's changed too now! Largely thanks to white men who were the politicians who made that happen.",

Everybody has their preference so what's the problem exactly? I understand that there is no need for a whites only dating site because they own every dating site including the<b>  black</b> dating site so it's kind of like why do you need special recognition when you own the f**** internet but at the same time I don't understand the point of this video. Maybe I'm just stupid but I thought the concept of America was freedom of choice and all aspects of your life so long as it's not interfering with anyone else is right and you're telling me at this point we become so stupid that you don't even have the basic right of choosing who you want to be with without Society stepping in and telling you who you should be with? This is why people hate the f**** news, here's a gem for you guys from West Texas. There was a fire about 2 hours away a couple of weeks ago and <b> a blac</b>k neighborhood in the fire had gotten so far out of control that the fire department decided not 2 try and enter the place despite the fact that<b>  a wom</b>an was screaming that a child was still inside in the child <b> was d</b>eaf and mute, will the dumbass fireman wasn't trying to hear it he was talking about his safety and his guys safety but there was a young white officer that I think was only 22 and I believe his name was Richard Park but I might be wrong about that and without hesitation hearing what was going on he ran into that burning building and saved <b> that b</b>lack child that was in fact huddled up in a corner in the back room. This 22<b>  yea</b>r old white cop that risked his life when he didn't have to for poor blacks is a f**** hero and instead of running this stupid story about a dating site you could have dedicated 30 seconds to this man but this is America and you're too distracted by Donald Trump or Kim Kardashian to give us real info that's relative and enriching to the life of every American",

It sounds like you're trying to tell people that they MUST have these wide open preferences, but that's contrary to very definition of the word 'preferences'. A preference is a discrimination (another word that's been boogeymanned) of things you do not enjoy, find safe, or want to partake in. For example, I do not like hard drugs, thus I discriminate against drugs and my preference is someone who is not a drug user. Otherwise the relationship would be off to a very rocky start. So yes, there is <b> nothing </b>wrong with having discriminatory tastes against things you do not enjoy or find contrary to your own lifestyle and principles. \nAnd to address racial preference directly, I will say that human beings are very tribal in nature. Even in Europe, a place that many people do not affiliate with tribal structures, was VERY tribal not a few hundred years ago. To me, it makes far more sense to want to seek out someone who looks more like you, talks and sounds more like you, has the same tastes in cultural things as you, shared the same interests as you such as cultural similarities. For example, I would find it difficult to share Christian ideals if I had a Muslim wife. Granted that's a religious difference, the same can be said for other cultural differences. \nI find your argument to be hypocritical in which you say people absolutely must seek out people of other races to find compatibility, yet the most fundamental traits of compatibility are cultural traits, and even racial traits in some regards. \nThis is why we have Latino neighborhoods,<b>  black</b> neighborhoods, Asian neighborhoods, etc. let alone markets that are geared towards certain races and cultures, and other institutions that are for or attract members of certain races and cultures. \nIt seems that the vast majority of people who support these ideas that we should mix or that we must are mostly white people, and that most other people (except some in th<b> e blac</b>k community perhaps) don't even remotely feel this way.",

We can't pick sides so just let it be. \n\nIf I say I prefer dating white women I'll face backlash f<b> rom my</b> black sisters and if I say I on<b> ly dat</b>e black women then I'll be called close-minded. We all have a preference and shouldn't be judged based on whom we like to date. Join whatever site you want and be happy. Good luck in your endeavors relationship-wise folks.",

That applies to any site they visit. \n\nYes we all discriminate on others, regardless of our individual genders, <b> race,</b> profession, height, weight etc. I'm just saying that it shouldn't be an issue if someone starts a site or business targeting a group of people without shutting out all others. \n\nFor example some companies like pharmaceutical ones will manufacture drugs designed to treat Caucasian,<b>  African</b> skin and even hair care since we bleed the same but our skins and hair are completely different. Even kids require different medication and dosage than adults thus the different care systems. \n\nPoint is that we are not all the same and shouldn't raise eye brows simply because others want different stuff or people to cater to their wants or needs. Everyone has a favorite color when it comes to a car, living room wall, phone cover and such. It does not mean they hate all the other colors and it's only a preference based on their own personal reasons.\n\nYes I know, this i<b> s weir</b>d comparing babies and all but hey! Lol",

The latter of which isn't even true in all cases given that there's plenty of patches in majority-white countries where whites are a minority. And also the elephant in the room you seem to ignore: That whites are kind of a worldwide minority and that this website is...uh...global. That probably won't get through your thick skull though because you people are desperately grasping at straws for every way to shame whites for existing.

Think about the other social organizations that exist to encourage \"Whites\" to \"stick to their kind\".

If you don't understand what I mean by that, which I guess you don't, I'm talking about being attracted out of identity.

My point on the matter was I'm not better than you so I'm not the one you should be getting an opinion on if you truly disagree w me\n\n3. That's the point I'm making. Your not expressing hate on someone or refusing to date a certa<b> in ra</b>ce based on hateful reasons, ie your <b> not rac</b>ist.<b> \n\n4. Ra</b>cism summed up is a hate for ones culture, <b> skin,</b><b>  race, eth</b>nicity, if you please. A preference is having no malicious hat<b> e for</b> a race, at the end of the day you like what you like.\n\n5. I'm simply stating my opinion shouldn't offend bc I'm not offended by yours. You did educate me. I now have a wider perspective on how some people think. Doesn't mean your opinion is wrong or that I'm ignoring it, I'm just not gonna change mine.\n\n6. I'm not gonna degrade your intelligence bc I don't know you or how you think. If you feel I have then I apologize. At the end of the this debate doesn't apply to someone who knows the difference.\n\n7. Overall my message was targeted to those who do not know the difference between the two. And I've meant enough people who wil<b> l date</b> a black man, treat<b>  the h</b>alf black babies like shit, bc those babie<b> s are </b>half black females, or train those kids <b> to not</b> date black people bc being <b> mixed </b>or non black is better th<b> an bei</b>ng full black. \n\n8. If you actually read my response you would have gotten all that bc that was what I basically said in a lot of words. \n\n9. Your not harming anyone that I know of but you'd be surprised how many people where I come from have so much self hate bc their not light or mixed enough, who feel the need to l<b> ie ab</b>out their race, to bleach their skin and get surgery to lo<b> ok any</b>thing but bl<b> ack bc </b>of hidden racism being called preference. How many people kill or endanger their children bc they don't want dark skinned kids. That's shits sad and it is very real whether you see the effects or not.",

But sadly, not everyone has the same intentions as you, long story short, rejecting someone based off their <b> race </b>can and in some cases cause psychological problems when it comes to self hate. They don't want kids who look like them, or have their genes or features. They want to breed the 'ugly' out of themselves. Ex. Google Lil Kim. Is just one of millions. But people are filled with so much hate for no other reason than believing they are superior to others. They can be so spiteful and ppl with self hate will still flock to them bc their basically brainwashed to think they are worthless. I used to be think that way when I was 7-18yrs<b>  old</b>. I'm in my early 20s now and I don't think that way anymore. Imagine walking into a room full of Native American women and having to wonder if they are 'into' Native American men or even like them. That kind of stuff has a massive effect especially on children. But interracial dating is not a problem for me personally as long as you have the right mindset. But I do wish m<b> y rac</b>e would unite like they did before segregation ended. Your lucky yo<b> ur ra</b>ce sees themselves as one instead of trying to live up to someone else's standard of important acne and self worth. Thanks for educating me on your perspective.",

So is the Banking system, and money printing system (FED). The government is also dominantly controlled by Israel through political Shills who've sold out their principles for a seat at power. Also, education is largely dominated by Jewish Cultural Marxists who teach minority students Leftist Social Justice ideology, and to hate and attack Whites by convincing them to envy or resent them for their nebulous 'White Privilege/Supremacy'; this despite the fact that if White Supremacy was real, it would not be teaching its people to hate and attack Whites the way our real life, inostensible, Jewish Zionist PC Supremacy teaches them.

While I love exploring other cultures, I want to feel like I can be comfortable and myself in a relationship.

Maybe because they got paid to do this.

From what I've seen, more often than not mixed children are just as much of a balance between the parents as mono-racial children and carry split resemblance between both ethnicities.  I tend to treat that argument as another veil.  Agreed on the genetic purity/superiority idea...smacks of <b> racism,</b> that.",

All this effort to force <b> race </b>mixing is ultimately what makes people more<b>  racist</b> and is leading to more hard-line segregationist and ethnonationalist movements. The classical liberal attitude of live and let live has been abandoned, and now different groups feel they need to dominate or purge one another just so they can be left alone.

There is a subconscious bias that this video is aiming to address. It is easier for the majority, with few negative stereotypes, to find partners. That makes the premise of a majority seeking majority dating website redundant.",

Why would you want to date or even be in a long term relationship with someone you're not attracted to? Doesn't mean you're a <b> racist </b>or wrong for knowing what you like. It also doesn't mean you think all people from a certain<b>  ethnicity</b> are unattractive, your brain just has a preference. This is coming from someone who has dated and had relations with people of all shades, and to try and shame me because I may prefer one over another when I'm seeking out a potential partner for the rest of my life is plain ignorant.",

Anyway it's claimed that 40% of ppl, in the us use these sites. I figured it'd be a high number, w/ out reading that article. I just find it amusing that there's prob. A lot of ppl who claim they don't use them but do. Or they act like they're too good for them. 40%! That's close to half of us! Let that sink. And I know there's a lot of cheaters on the net too. Even the married ones. Remember that Madison site? I think that's what it was called. The one where it was hacked, I guess. And there was a scare of releasing personal info? But these are the same ppl who use the i.net. As in, we're all dorks. & No, I've never been on there. It's just that some ppl try to front like they're not & in general. Some ppl have thought I was fake just bc they thought I was too attractive. I've met attractive ppl there as well. They just didn't work out. Besides, ppl juggle so much, dating sites are convenient... But convenient for fakes as well. I don't doubt there's prob. Some evil person out there w/ hiv, pissed off at the world, trying to infect ppl. Stole that idea from law and order. I'm pretty sure they steal their stories from the headlines. At least sometimes",

Did this blonde <b> woman,</b> with the creamy-mud-brown & orangish skin,   claim to be the epitome of what an anti<b> -racist</b> business owner looks like?  Wow, ok. That's really insane, or ballsey.  Yeah, I think, ballsey is correct. Although, it's also (just) a bit wrong... Awe... Shit, maybe she's confused?  \nUm, gee, I just don't know... Mmmph... let me think a minute. \nBut...  \nBut yet... \nUm, but but but but... but yet, Geesh. Ugh, she sure did seem to know a whole awful-lot (before-hand) about what would happen if she & her fella chose this type of, controversial, company name. \n\n- I mean, come-on... They both damn-near-sure knew that this company name would get the desired (WHITE) attention; at the same-time, their clever company name would steer away the \"help?\" and/or deliver the highest return a/o the easiest billing thought process eveeerrrrrr.... Right?  \nI mean, I guess that's pretty smart, of them, right?  \n\nAfter all...  Just because I say they'r<b> e racis</b>t cunts, doesn't mean that ole' Tanning-bed-Billy & Smells-Justaaah-Likaaah-burnin-flesh-Orangina, are actual<b> ly raci</b>st cunts!!!

It doesn't mean these owners meant what they meant when they created, marketed, and maintained the companies name?! \n\nI've decided... It's n<b> ot a ra</b>cist name, and they're not racists and the name is not at all what they, the owners, meant!  Damn! Please tell me that I'm right?  \nWhew...

They are starkly familiar, and not quite 100% human. And they're NOT warm-blooded.  They are male - or some cross section.  You can only know to be sure when you hear what they finally say.  They are mostly Americans and yes, white,  they are considered \"business-men\" and their ages range from the uber young to the barely breathing.  The most fucked-up characteristic is that they are ALL without functional penises.  Not even average sized genitalia.  Their DICKS (aka: penises) are so small, that it's really no wonder why, as a type of hybrid, that they all feel so threatened, and remain living-in-fear for lost of their sad lives, and learning to completely despise All W<b> arm bl</b>ooded Black men.  \n\nOk.  \nDid she?  <b> Did she </b>say \"Colored?\"  Maybe she said, \"Collard?\"  OR \"Collared?\" OR \"Columbo?\"  \"Cuckhold?\"  OR \"Culinarily?\" OR \"Corrupt?\"  OR \"Cough?\" OR \"Coliseum?\" OR \"COULTER?\"  OR \"Collaborate?\"  OR \"Colander?\"",

            "commentText": "Hi, I'm a white <b> woman.</b> I don't personally have racial preferences, but I get how some people do. Especially guys, they are visual so they find a certain 'look' more appealing. The difference is being open to getting to know someone who is otherwise a match even if they're not that persons primary preference. \n\nLike if you prefer brown hair, you shouldn't turn a person down simply because they're hair is blond. Or on eye color preferences. No one factor should be the one physical attribute that you refuse to date,<b>  race</b> in particular. If so, it just means you are shallow and value the wrong things in people.  \n\nI knew a white guy who turned down a girl who liked him with the only reason being 'I don't dat<b> e blac</b>k girls.' I thought this was a stupid reason because he basically just cut off an entire races eligibility. He could have said they didn't have chemistry or he didn't like her that way. But his reason was solely based on h<b> er ra</b>ce alone. He wasn't a catch anyway so she dodged a bullet there. \n\nIt's kind of like how I have a body size preference but I'm open to guys who don't fit that preference as well. If they're a good fit in other ways (emotional, chemistry) I'll still try. In fact my current boyfriend is a big guy, but I am glad I was open to him, 2 years later. \n\nI don't have an issue with the site existing. Not my problem, in the end. But it is kind<b>  of d</b>umb, on the other hand, that a lot of white people (as the majority) subconsiously ignore any o<b> ther </b>race profiles on sites, either because of a preference or just because they don't stand out as candidates. Maybe they dont know any <b> other</b> race of person in their life so they don't think as them as contenders. It sucks for the mi<b> norit</b>y race people just trying to find love being ignored by a majority of other daters on the sites. And with this being the case white people Really dont need Another site that caters to them specifically. They'll find way more white people on the more popular and uncontroversial sites anyway.  Sorry for the freaking paragraph, haha",

Whites are too concern about minorities and they can care less about you.\n\nWhite Americans are mostly likely to date inside their group 85 percentage of the time, and mix racially less than Asian Males.  Whites are not having a hard time dating. \n\nIf you are White and can not find another White person in a White dominate soceity you are an idiot.  \n\nWhat's wrong with a all White site?!

If you want other people to care about your issues you have to care about theirs one hand washes the other.  Take BLM the group wasnt saying only<b>  black</b> lives matter they were saying hey unarme<b> d blac</b>k people are being killed by the police this needs to be addressed and a lot of white people totally attacked them.  Our president said latinos are murders and rapists, with those two things that most whites were apathetic or highly vocally againist why do you think they would care about any of our issues?",

That's just like me opening a shop in the SAHARA desert and calling it\" where to find/buy sand\".Such a person has to be MENTALLY RETARDED or a <b> RACIST.</b>There is no third alternative.They were smart enough to start a website company so I know that they are not STUPID. What is stopping a white person from going on match and eharmony(mind you-you can still set racial preferences by the way on there)? The problem is two fold, it is a GENETIC psychological problem passed down in white blood mixed with and/or decades of racial and identity politics in the USA that causes this. I still can't get over the fact that they live in FUCKING SALT LAKE UTAH(that is whiter than leprosy).Where white people meet is dog whistle politics for where<b>  racist</b> white people can meet(in secret to do and say bad things hence their issues with flag activity), because only <b> a racis</b>t white person would think that they needed a site called where white people meet to meet other white people. As for the whe<b> re bla</b>ck people meet thi<b> ng. Rac</b>ist either don't understand maths or<b>  are ra</b>cist.When you factor in the fact that blacks are a MINORITY, and also the fact that a relative chunk of their population will not yet be online(dating)couple that with <b> other r</b>acist issues like mass incarceration.You have a small population spread over a large surface population area, it would then be GENUIINLY DIFFICULT for blacks to meet a PO<b> SSIBLE</b> black candidate, because i bet you that all those blacks o<b> n wher</b>e black people meet are also n sites like Eharmony and Match they just have to compensate with sites like WBPM....blacks<b>  are no</b>t racist. Blacks don't have a history of murdering, slaving and dehumanizing other people WILLINGLY!!!. Whites have that history and still do it today. Another stupid argument similar to that was passed by that retarded bastard Jared Taylor -whites don't have a home for themselves.There where no whites in the Entre USA, New Zealand, Hawaii, S.Africa and Australia just to name a fee those places are still inhabited by white people due to THEFT and MURDER.If there were no whites in any of the aforementioned coun<b> tries an</b>d colored people where flooding into Europe then we could have a discussion.",

Sites like this are developed because of preference. As a white man, I don't want to have to check filters in order to select a specific<b>  race</b>. I date white and I want white, so there's no reason why I can't go to a dating site that provides a large selection of the white women I'm looking for. I also don't want to be emailed by non whites since I'm looking for whites. I want to be comfortable in my own demographic. There's absolutel<b> y nothin</b>g wrong with this. Saying that blacks have a harder time meeting other blacks is completely ridiculous. Blacks have their own dating sites and utilize every other dating website available. It is more factual to say that blacks have an easier time meeting other blacks. Every non whi<b> te ra</b>ce has their own dating site while whites have to choose from multicultural dating sites (multicultural = less whites) \n\nTo argue against a 100% white  populated dating site is just more anti white bigotry. It's the s<b> ame </b>old song. Non whites attacking whites because they aren't included while whites have to include everyone. Man up and let white people do their own thing. Or do you not like white people?",

You need 'help' dating and a site for whites that want to date only other whites is somehow 'white privilege'?  lol  Well, yeah, we actually DO have the 'privilege' to date whoever the hell we want to, and that includes the choice to date within our own <b> race.</b>  I'm white and date within my own<b>  race</b> because that's who I'm attracted to and would totally appreciate a site like this if I was looking for a dating site.  I would never respond to <b> a blac</b>k guy if I was on a dating site because I'm not attracted <b> to bla</b>ck men, and the vast majority of white men aren't attracted<b>  to bl</b>ack women.  Most white men, and most men in general that date outside t<b> heir </b>race,  tend to prefer hispanic and  asian women.  \n Frankly, I don't give a single crap about your personal woes, and that's any<b> body, </b>black or not, and neither does anyone else.

My best guy friend for the last 20 years, who happens to be <b> black,</b> has a sister with 9...yes, 9... kids by 4 different felons, who weren't around because...surprise!...they were always in and out of jail.  While my buddy and I were busting our asses at work sometimes 6 days a week, she sat around the house on her ass smoking dope all day with her welfare queen friends who also had several kids by 'thug life' types and living all  expenses paid thanks to  hardworking people like me.  My buddy's sister  had a house nicer than I could afford, $3000 a month in food stamps, all bills paid, you name it.  I love that I go to work and pay MY damn taxes so they can go to supporting these loser cunts who are living a lot easier than I am, in nicer homes, with better food,  being no more than brood sows.   >:(   Goddamn that pisses me off.  There should be a limit to how much welfare these bottom feeding bitches get.  After two kids, they shouldn't get another<b>  re<b> d</b</b>> cent.  Let them get off their asses and work if they want to eat.  \n By 16, two of her daughters were already pregnant and 1 of her teen sons had already been busted for theft and is well on his way to a life of crime.   One of her daughters, the oldest and the smartest, said the hell with her mom's kind of life and joined the army.  Thank God for small favors.",

What is stopping a white person from going on match and \neharmony(mind you-you can still set racial preferences by the way on \nthere)? The problem is two fold, it is a GENETIC psychological problem \npassed down in white blood mixed with and/or decades of racial and \nidentity politics in the USA that causes this. I still can't get over \nthe fact that they live in FUCKING SALT LAKE UTAH(that is whiter than \nleprosy).Where white people meet is dog whistle politics for where <b> \nracist</b> white people can meet(in secret to do and say bad things hence \ntheir issues with flag activity), because only <b> a racis</b>t white person \nwould think that they needed a site called where white people meet to \nmeet other white people.

Another stupid argument similar to that \nwas passed by that retarded bastard Jared Taylor -whites don't have a \nhome for themselves.There where no whites in the Entre USA, New Zealand,\n Hawaii, S.Africa and Australia just to name a fee those places are \nstill inhabited by white people due to THEFT and MURDER.If there were no\n whites in any of the aforementioned coun<b> tries an</b>d colored people where \nflooding into Europe then we could have a discussion.",

                    "commentText": "Well I'll say this. Most of the worlds problems have been and are still caused by white people-wars/racism/pollution/genocide. It is true that Europeans have contributed a large amount to the development of the \"modern\" world-but at what cost? and the term \"Modern\" is relative. Egypt would have considered it self the modern world in that time. The term \"White\" is a cult term. What i am saying is that every \"white\" person is born into a CULT-as long as they are born in and grow up in a western country, All right wing parties have CULT like affinities (Totalitarianism/Lack of personal identity(Ergo \"I am white/i am a collective\"/Us vs them mentality/Different set of moral laws relating to those \"others\"(Every white colonial country has had Discrimination directly written into their law books(from New Zealand to S.Africa to USA to Australia but not necessarily European countries(Europeans are not white-they are dutch, Italian etc)/Stigmatization of anyone who breaks the CULT mindset or thinks for themselves(White women who date <b> black </b>men are virulently castigated and are labelled mud sharks other examples include Libtards/Snowflake etc)/Cults feed their members a steady dose of misinformation/ propaganda and as a cult member it is mandatory that you believe what the leaders/group tell you WITHOUT CHECKING IT OR THINKING CRITICALLY Its why you have white people who think that minorities especially<b>  black</b> people get extra points on SATs just for indicatin<b> g rac</b>e,you have white people that said they preferred the Affordable care act to Obamacare and actually gave lengthy arguments about the two, even-though they are the same thing( They didn't bother to check because other cult members/white people told me therefore it must be true. Also cults make sure to ISOLATE its members from the outside world/others SEGREGATION LAWS IN THE USA/J<b> IM CR</b>OW LAWS.What the isolation does is that it enables the propaganda/lies to take deep root.That's why you have 80% of the white population in the 1960s and 50s say th<b> at \"Bl</b>ack people face absolutely no barriers or hindrance to employment/schooling and/or housing due to t<b> heir </b>race in the USA\"--This was in the 60s! when riots where happening, dogs where being set on people, water hoses and all that stuff. Communism is a white affair, the entire soviet union was more or less \"white\" that made it possible to kill more than 40million people plus an extra 7million in ukraine(holodomore)-White people have killed more people than any other group of people on this planet combined -including killing the most amount of white people-Europes entire history is soaked in bloody wars. I am not saying that all white people are bad, there are good white people example G.H Hardy,but the truth of the matter is that most white people are BAD PEOPLE.I think it is a genetic thing-another topic for another day-but i,ll leave you with this lovely video- [LINK]   [LINK]  are part of a cult.",
