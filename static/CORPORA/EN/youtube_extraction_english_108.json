When people are deciding what age to have children at, you'll often hear them say that before they have kids there are a lot of things they want to get done first. Maybe travel the world, maybe concentrate on a career, or at least just wait until the twenties are out of the way. On the flip side, some people will tell you that they want to have children at a young enough age so that they can actively play sports with their children when the kids are in their teens, adding that they don't want to be ageing parents because they fear they won't have the energy required, say, in their 50s, to still be dealing with kids. Today we'll talk about all the pros and cons, in this episode of the Infographics Show, Is it better to be born to younger or older parents?. . .

In my head, I was just like \"um...I wish and he seemed like a cool guy, but I barely knew him. Thanks for making me look terrible in front of everyone.\" \nBut anyway, yeah, that's a big disadvantage to having older parents.",

One person's \"perfect at <b> age </b>28\" is another person's \"perfect at 38\".<b>  Age</b> is just a number. People mature at different rates. Some may be financially stable at 26, others may not be until they're in their 40's. Everyone is different. Eac<b> h ag</b>e group is going to have their own advantages and disadvantages, a lot of times they're personal. \n\nPersonally, I had older parents. Dad wasn't in the picture. I was raised by my mom who had me at 39 (and my sister at 43) and my grandmother. There was definitely an issue of generation gap in the household. Mom was so busy working all the time she didn't have a lot of energy for us when she was actually home. It all worked out the way it was supposed to though and I wouldn't change it. I love my mom \u2764",

            "commentText": "I think it can go either way. Young parents can be financially responsible and ready and some older parents can be the opposite. For example,  I got married at <b> age </b>21 because we wanted too and had been in a relationship for a long time. Our first child was born when I was almost 23. No drugs, no drinking,  we had our finances mostly stable. We weren't extremely well off, but were both debt free and knew how to budget and maintain our household. A few years later we had our twins and were much more financially well off. Our kids are well adjusted and , so far, do well in school and don't have any behavioral issues or anything. But, there's a mom who has a child in my son's class and she had him at 43, unplanned,  and has a history of drug and<b>  alcohol</b> abuse. She still lives with her parents and can't maintain a job as well as relies on her mom to do most of the parenting for her. Her son is always in trouble,  got kicked out of preschool. Has been reprimanded several times for bullying and even cursing at the teachers and had to be held back for the next school year because his classroom performance wasn't at a level that would make the next grade an easy adjustment for him. But, there are older parents that fit the mold you mentioned and young parents that do as well. There will always be exceptions,  but generalizing may not be the best approach.",

I think those women who try to have kids in their late 40's/50's through IVF are totally selfish and the practice should be outright banned, it must be awful for these kids to reach their late teens only for it to dawn on them that their parents will be dead soon. No-one wants their parents to die but it's much more natural and easier to prepare for if you are already in your 40's yourself when it happens.",

As someone whose parents had me when they were in their early 40s, I would've loved (also wished at times) that circumstances allowed them to have me in their early 30s. Or even mid-30s.\n\nAnd there's another disadvantage for the children of older parents: early caregiving\n\nThe children of older parents are likely to start off their adult lives taking care of their aging parents. Their lives/careers are put on hold as a result and they end up staying in the nest longer than expected. It is NOT FUN being a millennial caregiver who's single, unemployed, and stuck in the nest while everyone you know from high school and college have jobs, spouses, and (in some cases) kids. I'm hoping I'm not unemployable and forever single.",

My little  who is 10 years younger than me was born when my parents were 'old'. Her vocabulary is terrible, and now both of our parent's health has deteriorated so she never got to go out and go for walks with daddy or visit family far away. Our family is now less active so she doesn't have any kind of experience with those things. She gets sad because she's feels left out (the <b> age </b>gap, she's now 7 and we are all above 13, me being 17) . She is not academically inclined and shows no signs yet of having any other little talent. Because of an accident my father couldn't work so income was mainly on my mother, who is now sick.\n Maybe   I think it nay have to do with my parents too. My mother was the youngest of her siblings while my father was the eldest. She probably looked up to hers and she matured around their company. My father became independent and was the only one of 6 to move out. So I guess there was a balance coz he's 15 years older than mom. \nI'm rambling, imma shut up now, lol \nIts debatable, but I like the points",

            "commentText": "Based on my experience, young parents.\n\nMy parents had me at 40 and 43. My mom got married 3 yrs before I was born. When I told a high school friend that, he told me that I was a miracle. One time early in high school, a couple of friends were talking about their dads reaching 50 and I told them mine was reaching 60. They didn't have much energy to play with me as a kid (they got tired easily, but I was able to entertain myself and I was able to get over lack of playing time). They're in their late 60s, with my dad turning 70 in a few months. I'm in my mid-20s and I've been taking care of my mom for the last several yrs (my parents are divorced and I'm her lone caregiver). Being a caregiver in your 20s is NOT FUN. At all. I'm stuck in the nest while all my friends from high school and college have jobs, spouses, and (in some cases) kids. And most of the people I was with in high school aren't in my hometown anymore. I'm hoping I'm not unemployable and forever single. Contrary to media outlets, people in my generation (millennials) are getting married early. I know A LOT of people from high school and college who've gotten married in the last 5-6 yrs.\n\nHowever, I do thank the Lord that my circumstances aren't worse and that I'm able to hold it together. And last year, I knew 8 people (11 overall when siblings are included) who lost a parent last year. 7 were from high school, 1 from college. Of them all, most of them were in their 50s when they died. Two were in their 60s, with the oldest being 65.\n\nIf you wait until your late 30s/early 40s to have kids, your kids are at risk of taking care of you much sooner than expected. It's a disadvantage that needs to be made more public. It's better to have your kids take care of you AFTER they get their lives/careers launched and not BEFORE. People label it as selfishness, but to me, you're being careless if you have kids at 40. Barring unforeseen circumstances, have your kids while you're young. DO NOT be a teen parent, but don't wait too long. Rather than tell someone who says don't wait to mind their business, listen to them, especially if their premise is based on keeping your kids from spending their 20s taking care of you.\n\nShould I be childless (and married) by the time I reach 40, I'm adopting, if circumstances allow it. In that scenario, I'm adopting a child that would've been by biological child in my early to mid 30s.\n\nAs far as some of the points mentioned:\n\n-Barring something unforeseen, my mom will live a long life, but it's not going to be because she had me late. For her, it'll be because of genetics. My great-grandmother lived to be 94 (her last surviving sister lived to be 100) and my grandmother will soon turn 91. Those two were young when they had kids.\n\n-Most of my older relatives are still alive. Few have died. My family is relatively big.\n\n-And as far as kids helping older parents with tech issues, it's likely annoying and cringeworthy from the kid's perspective. I'm basing that on my personal experiences.",

There were, of course, some good young parents, but the vast majority of the time the older  parents were better parents - less selfish, more mature, more focused on the kids, more stable relationships etc. Additionally, parents who chose to have only one child tended to be the best (and least stressed) parents, because they were completely focused on that child, as opposed to having to divide their attention between multiple children. Overall, I have been fully convinced that waiting longer to have children is always a good idea - and so is limiting the number of children that you have.",

Of course they aren't perfect, but I personally wouldn't wish for younger parents.",

One of my parents had to work hardcore just to get our families head above water and i rarely got to see them, and the other parent doesn't know how to emotionally handle kids and is emotionally stuck at the <b> age </b>us kids came around. So much so the one parent became emotionally volitile and not able to care for me or my siblings-we ended up having to parent the one parent at times. \nNot saying all younger parents are destined to become this way, I live in a poor area so ofc I know many young parents and it's a mixed bag of some very bad parents and some amazing hardworking ones.\nBut I always felt jealous over those with older parents, like all my friends have. They always complain that their parents don't understand them due to the generational gap (granted, my parents are considered millenials and I'm on the cusp of millenial and gen z generation, so there's not much generational misunderstanding-albeit theres no generation gap with others in my family since we're all poor and in the same boat. They understand hardships much better and can sympathize) but I still felt that the way their parents handled situations were more mature, and some of my friends are a little spoiled (doesnt make them bad people though <3). Sometimes when I watch their fights happen it's the friend and parent misinterpretting each other and the friend might be acting out of selfish though-or rather, not really thinking about what the parent is feeling, and vice versa. Also their fights are never life and death, while growing up with younger parents I've had one particular parent act in rage and threaten to kill or beat me. \nThere's not a lot of benefits to be born with very young parents, and I personally never intend to become one myself. I hope that every person who becomes a parent-either by surprise or planned out-can watch helpful videos, read books, and receive education to help themselves grow into the best parent they can be.",

I've never seen him run, play with us, do sports etc. We did have a lot more than others financially but he retired when I was 10 and it also sucked to always have my parents at home all the time. \nGrowing up we always had to put up with his health issues. He became forgetful, incontinent etc. He passed away suddenly (stroke) at <b> age </b>83 (I was a 24 year<b>  old</b> student, doing my masters degree). \nWhen I was young I always swore that I'd be a young mother and that I'd have my kids b<b> y ag</b>e 25. \nI'm now 36, married with two little kids that I had <b> at a</b>ge 32 and 35. \nI definitely don't see myself as <b> an '</b>old mom' since all my friends have kids more or less the <b> same</b> age. Back when I was young mothers were younger but not anymore. \nI'm glad I lived my life before settling down. I'm definitely a better parent now than I would have been 10 years ago. \nThat being said, it's all about your personality and your upbringing. I know phenomenal young/teenage moms and shitty older moms. \nReading the comments, it's nice to see many people have older dads. Where were you guys when I was growing up? :p",

            "commentText": "Hey, I really don't understand how you guys did the research for the health risks associated with pregnancy and <b> age </b>related to women, and somehow still chose to omit the fact the the health risks for both mother and child are significantly higher, in terms of both mortality and morbidity rates, when the mother is younger than 21. This is supported by both the CDC and the WHO who ran massive meta studies showing that it was biological immaturity rather than other factors which increased the risk.\n\nHaving a child younger than 21 was shown to be far more risky than having one older than 35,  and the increased risks associated with having a child with developmental disabilities also is largely dependent on the<b>  age</b> of the man th<b> e woma</b>n is with. Men over t<b> he a</b>ge of 31 have a notable decrease in sperm quality, and as women tend to partner with men in a 5 year window of of their <b> own </b>age (2 years younger, to 3 years older) their male partner's adva<b> nced</b> age contributes to those issues.\n\nHowever, when speaking about developmental disabilities of children born to older mothers, people will often cite the fact that those risks double afte<b> r th</b>e age of 35, but neglect to mention that that doubling is off of a risk factor of less than 1%, and the doubled number is still under 1%, meaning that the added benefits of waiting for the opportune time to have a child for some couples would still greatly outweigh the likelihood of such defects. It's around the same probability of dying while getting your wisdom teeth out, so people pushing that narrative so much seems far more about trying to dictate when couples (particularly women) should have kids, rather than being based on hard facts and logic.\n\nWhen it comes to women, the best time to have a child from a purely biological stand point, based on the best data we have that accounts for wealth, and environment, is 21-31, with a decline after 35. Men do not in fact \"keep giving and giving\", there is also a reduction in sperm quality following the same time frames.",

Not to mention, I can more relate to things he is going though because it wasn't that long ago for me as well. Often times my son is mistaken for my brother because I still look very young myself. Older parents dont understand tech (most of them), they are set in their ways, they aren't progressive and they're starting to develop health issues.

There's an obsessive focus on the mother, as if the father's DNA has no impact on birth defects, when in fact, it does. It makes it sound like the mother's solely at fault for Down Syndrome.",

            "commentText": "Rushing into having kids is never a good idea. When this happens, any marriage isn't set in stone yet, often parents get divorced early on and stress out the kid. Older parents how have already been married for over a decade have a much more solid, stable relationship, and also will have more established careers, so money won't be so much of an issue. If they've already finished college, then they can help their kids through the entire process. If they're retired, they can spend more time with their kids. My mom started having kids at 21, and had me at 28, got divorced when I was 6, had to work two jobs and send me to daycare, isn't financially stable everything is always paycheck by paycheck. I didn't get as much attention as I should have and ended up with a bunch of issue. My best friend who is nineteen, her parents are in her sixties, her dad has a great stay at home job, and her mom is retired, I was actually displaced because of sibling drama <b> senior </b>year and lived with them and it was so enlightening being able to have a parental figure there all the time, helping me step by step through everything , who doesn't have all those other responsibilities or makes me feel like a burden.",

Thats why I have no qualms about being an older parent, I'm not planning on having my kids in my 60s but I think late 30s/early 40s isn't exactly the worst thing on the planet.\nPeople who are stressing out about losing their parents early need to remember that many people are living way into their 80s and 90s now and being a young parent does not mean that you will definitely have more energy for your kids, my parents worked all hours during their 20s and were therefore too exhausted to play with their kids too. \nAbove all else children just need financially security, a roof over their head and food on the table and most importantly loving parents. <b> Age </b>is just a number.",

My personal reason is because I would like to have more time with my children. Think about it this way. You give birth to your child at 25. Say for example you live until you're 65. That is 40 years you got to be in your child's life, whereas compared to having that child at 45. By the time they're 15, you'll already be 60. That puts a huge burden on both of you. Not only have you retired, but what if you can't help them with college? Not everyone saves efficiently. But now that kid is stuck with the question of trying to support you at such a young <b> age.</b> Also from the child's perspective, they wouldn't have even had that much time with their own parents. These are the factors that I put into this question. <b>  Nothing</b> else. Only time. I'm not talking about family issues or anything else, just time.",

Because people can generalize older parents too as well. Having children when your too <b> old </b>can result in a number of health complications that may not be even worth having a child. And then raising them still might be a problem because you have these career hungry older adults that never had time for a kid in the first place.

But most young parents I have met are struggling and they live in apartments or live broke and I have seen how it affects kids. But. I have seen older parents and hear the complaints of the parents having health issues or they are not interested in doing active activities. In my experience. Most older parents wanted kids more then the Younger parents. A lot of young parents got pregnant by mistake or did not want them. I have seen many of these go bad. Older parents like my <b> age </b>44 with kids 6 years<b>  old</b>. We spend all of our time with them. I feel guilty my kids will graduate college and I will be retiring and prob will die when they are in their late 30s give or take. A lot of us older parents are this way because of our baby boomer parents we had. We grew up with parents who provided well but never spent time with us. This shaped many of us Early Gen X this way. We all know we will be older parents. But I know my kids will never say we never spent time\nWith them or never went on vacations....",

Children born to older parents are more likely to have to become a full time carer to their parents when their parents degrading health takes away their independence (unless the option of a care home is available, at great expense). This will likely happen right at the time when the child is reaching the peak of their career in middle <b> age,</b> and have a family of their own to raise, forcing them to give it all up to be a carer for possibly 20+ years.

I'm not worried about that either. If my kids would be I'll love them the same. And my mom dad have worked with mentally I'll people for almost 30 years. I know how to interact with them anyway. I'll love each and every one of my future kids no matter what. \nP.S. I don't know if you're Russian or not but my grandfather was from Russia.",

I feel like I had to learn everything on my own which puts me at a disadvantage when I'm just starting to understand things like credit card taxes and things like that and I'm just getting in my 30s. It's ridiculous. It's just when you don't know things it can put you behind. I plan on becoming a parent but I'll be an older parent meeting having my child in my late 30s but I will be more prepared financially and better educator. God bless you and your father and you cherish every moment you can",

I didn't play outside as much, I'm not an only child but my sister is seven years older, my mother is a foreigner (Dad's from Australia which is where we live, she's Indonesian) so less time outside and less time watching kid movies (because my teenage sister wasn't into it) but I read way more books, I got a pretty big room for a kid, parents aren't super stressed about money as the house is not mortgaged, Dad hasn't worked since 1992 so I've always had him around.\n\nSome downsides are that we don't ever go out for lunch or dinner because they don't like leaving the house, technology skills are not great, the generation gap (cultural differences in my mum's case) sometimes makes it difficult for them to understand me.\nI did move out and felt extremely guilty for leaving when I eventually came home and don't feel comfortable moving out again because they need me which I guess sucks but obviously they are my family and they are going to always come first whether I feel obligated or not.\n\nI guess my opinion would be there are positives and negatives to both older and younger parents, but I think the most important thing is to have loving, supportive and capable parents which is possible in both scenarios.",

I can testify to that, because my mum is about to be 50 next year and I've literally only recently turned 18 few months ago! And NO, she loses her cool VERY often bc she has a bipolar disorder (which has been hard for me but I'm more positive this year from my own efforts, and I'm glad to hopefully move out next year) and she's a single parent, she has to work her socks off to provide for the both of us and other bills etc. And she's still not retiring, even when I move out next year maybe. So this statistic only applies to kids with BOTH parents but even then, that might not be true considering not all races have the same ways of spending time and teaching their kids etc.",

Natural selection should always come so we can improve as a <b> race,</b> as a species. Death isn't the enemy. It's only bad when you have wasted your life. So no, I won't kill myself now, cause I plan to do a lot still. Death shapes the world. It pushes it to become stronger, better, as evolution works. If we keep sustaining ourselves, many of us, who are<b>  fat</b>, lazy, sick... maybe we won't evolve as <b> a rac</b>e to become smarter and stronger. Maybe there is a better form for ourselves in the future, but we are holding it back, suppressing ourselves because you don't need to be stronger and smarter anymore, you are taken care of, and have no reason to fight. I, for one, don't want to live to 200+ because that's far too long, and unnatural.\n\nAnd better conditions of natural resources and the availability of food.. isn't just down to how good we are at science.

I also have 2 older sisters.\n\nCompare that to my girlfriend, who is almost my <b> age </b>and a single child, her dad is almost 40, mum is quite a bit younger, they are both intolerable and put so much stress onto their daughter. They are split up, dad is getting drunk a lot, is very clingy and has anger issues, being an abosolute embarrasment in public because he loves football.The mum is loud, obnoxious, smokes\u00a0alot, also drinks a lot, and just doesn't support my gf at all. She literally said \"Aww your cute when your angry\" with no support whatsoever. Dad has a decent job, being a teacher, the mum doesn't really have one, still living with HER parents (who are nice, being older ;) ). Because of this, my girlfriend has a lot of stress and can't really talk to her family much about things. There is always a lot of pressure on her. Overall, from my experience, older parents are a lot better.",

You made my night with that one.\n\nRegardless it's funny as hell, but it's not accurate.  As I've said previously men want young women for children, women want men who are either slightly older or if they got some <b> weird </b>daddy thing way older because of resources and security.  \n\nIt simply doesn't work the other way around since the older a<b>  woman</b> is the less likely she is to have healthy kids and the younger man won't have as much to provide to her compared to an older competitor.\n\nSure you might see cougars and younger guys boning here and there, but it's not going to go any further than that.\n\nEdit: Love the name btw.  I love me some diet bleach myself.",

Teenage pregnancies carry significant risk, and younger mothers are often unable to properly raise and care for an infant. It's important to note that the brain doesn't stop developing until around 25--a 16 year <b> old </b>may be technically capable of having a child, but emotionally, financially, and physically unprepared to do so. You also make some strange and biased assumptions: that men want \"young, attractive women\" (yuck) and that women want \"resources to raise their children.\" The idea that men want younger women is entirely sociological, and has no biological or inherent base to it. And women, of course, are entirely capable of desiring a career and a high-paying job, in addition to or without children. You also fail to account for men who wish to stay home and care for their children, or for how men's fertility wanes during their thirties and forties.",

Young people managed family for thousand and even million of years just fine and even happily with the support of their family of course. The government just scares you, so you won't have too many kids. It's basically the government the population control. Don't think government would do that. Look at China and their one child rule. The West is just more settle about it and I don't think it's wrong for the government to have population control. It is needed for our survival.

Now regarding to the comment your mother made that is just her opinion the topic she was talking was way back in the past and I know what had happened in Hitler's regime but the way you call your mother a monster is really hard it was just her comment about the subject of the matter which happened year's and years ago maybe before you were even born and the comment that your mother made was just her sole opinion on the matter remember this one's opinion does not affect the other person's decision solely and ones opinion cannot undo the past and cannot predict the present and future the past is the past but we cannot change fact what effect it has done on our lives THE PAST MAY BE THE PAST BUT SURELY WE CANNOT FORGET THE LESSONS IT HAD THOUGHT  HAS AND LEGACY IT HAS INFLICTED ON THE FUTURE GENERATION. AGAIN THE PAST MAY BE PAST BUT SURELY MUST  NOT FORGET THE HISTORY OF IT THIS IS JUST MY OPINION ON THE MATTER IF I HAD DONE SOMETHING TO INFLICT FOR YOU TO INSULT YOUR PARENTS IM SORRY I DID NOT MEAN THAT LETS GET NOT SERIOUS ABOUT THIS TOPIC AND ENJOY THE FACTS OF IT THANK YOU HAVE A WONDER FUL DAY",

When the Chinese people realize the gravity of the problem they'll leave China for other lands.  Most likely Europe or the US.

The other being conquering other lands through military force, i.e. war.  \n\nA high birth rate is good for your country because put very simply, the cultures who have the most children will control the future.

So essentially men protect and provide for women, but in return they are subordinate to the men.  \n\nKeep in mind there's a massive difference between a soft<b>  patriarchy</b> and a har<b> d patriarch</b>y.  A ha<b> rd patriarc</b>hy is some mad max shit, where women are rape slaves and weak men die in droves.  S<b> oft patriar</b>chy is similar to a relationship between a parent and a child.  The parent may be in a position of authority, but they cannot abuse the child and they are directly responsible for them.  <b> Soft patria</b>rchy is what we had for a long time and only recently did we swap to a more egalitarian system.  \n\nEgalitarianism is a lot like communism.  A good idea in theory, but in practice it doesn't work.  Granted it works better than communism, but that's beside the point.  Egalitarian societies slowly decay over time as the women refuse to have children.  \n\nThere's a lot of reasons why Egalitarianism has serious failings, but for the sake of brevity I'll leave it there.

Frankly if you're an average man with an average mind you're better off going into trades.  Colleges can and will discriminate against you in applications, not to mention that they're full of bureaucratic bullshit and this is coming from a college student.  The Trades as a whole (plumbing, electricians, carpenters, etc) are seeing reductions in their labor pool since much of the <b> old </b>guard is retiring.\n\nThey're not 6 figure salaries, but they're definitely sufficient to support a small family with two, maybe three kids if you're financially savvy.  Frankly the only reason I'm not in there myself is because my entire family put so many resources into me going to college that I essentially have to.  It'd be selfish not to.\n\nAll that aside, people need to stop with the 'I'm not financially sufficient' shit.  Believe me if you have any kind of will, a bit of muscle and decent head on your shoulders you can make at least 30k.  People are just too lazy to find jobs or are complete pansies who don't want to get their hands dirty.  \n\nUltimately I don't care if the birth rate rises, in fact I don't expect it to.  I have precautions for the event of either total societal collapse or demographic replacement.  I'd just perfer it if I never had to use said fallbacks.  I perfer my<b>  nation</b> the way it is and I'd like it if it remained that way.  The only way that happens is through an sustainable birth rate.  I'd definitely like the next generation of Americans to be born in America, not be imported because women want their precious careers and men can barely be considered men anymore.  \n\nWell there is one little silver lining.  For me anyway.  Me and disappointment with my fellow man are basically siblings at this point.  So at least I won't be surprised when Sharia Law hits my streets.  XD",
