To do what she is doing, and not get plastic surgery, the world, as it is today, would be waay harder on her. It would be unbelievable. I believe that she is just trying to live as normally as she can, while still doing what she loves. If people can eventually come to accept Madonna performing in her older <b> age,</b> but LOOKING young as she does, this could pave the way for other female performers to not only BE older, but to LOOK older too.",

            "commentText": "I think Madonna used to be inspiring, she did what she wanted, and didn't care about rules she was breaking. When I was growing up, I always looked up to her. But after \"Confessions on the Dance Floor\" Seeing how souless her music got, the more she relied on auto tuning, it made me lose so much respect. Not only that, but just seeing how she truly only cares about herself. Not to mention, she preaches about fighting <b> age,</b> but showed such signs of insecurity of her<b>  age</b>, and relied on surgery to further inflate her ego. Plenty of women have aged gracefully and didn't fight it, but have accepted it. True acceptance is the only way t<b> o ag</b>e. Fighting it, like fighting the inevitability that we're all going to die, is futile.",

That is not what \"bei<b> ng sexu</b>al\" even is to 99.9% of the population.  Sophia Loren, Ann Margaret, and Raquel Welch are all still considered sexy seniors - the difference is Raquel Welch is not still trying to wear the fur bikini and pretend she's 2<b> 1.  Nob</b>ody says people c<b> an't</b> age and sti<b> ll be s</b>exual.  But there is a pretty worldwide consensus that life has seasons and it's SAD when anybody (famous or not) tries to hold on to their youth.  There are lots of sexy aging 80's female singers who are embracing aging, look<b>  the</b>ir age, and are sexy as hell.  Madonna is just SAD.  \n Secondly:  Her insistence that there is a double standard for men and women <b> as t</b>hey age also rests on the false premise that men don't also adjust their looks and shows and physicality to respect their aging.  Rocking men who did back-flips on stage, flexed their abs, and did jump splits into the audience when they were 20 are not still doing that at 60... sorry Madonna.  \nMadonna used to embrace change and re-invention.  Now she's dug in her heels and embraced victim mentality.  She refuses to embrace aging and is (ironically) SAYING she's embracing aging by \"<b> fightin</b>g ageism,\" but what she's really doing is rebelling against aging.  She's not embracing it at all. Again... SAD.",

Here's the thing:  People who \"need to be themselves\" must accept responsibility if the public is not interested in them.  People who don't want to conform to what the public wants are either celebrated as groundbreaking, or they are dismissed and criticized.  Being celebrated is not a human right.  LOL  Madonna has spent her life being celebrated as groundbreaking - everybody has wanted what she is putting out.  And she has gotten REALLY entitled.  Now she expects to always be celebrated no matter what she does?  Well, guess what Madonna... the world does not revolve around you.  Now she is being dismissed because people don't WANT a sad <b> old </b<b> >woman</b> who is so self-obsessed she eats kelp, work out 8 hours a day, and puts magical clay on her skin to retain her youthful glow.  The public has always had the RIGHT to want what she's selling or not want it.  Lots of people want to be \"true to themselves\" but for the vast majority of us that means being criticized, mocked, derided - not celebrated and loved.  Artistic acceptance is not a right.  Maybe she's at a crossroads in her life where she has to decide what's more important to her:  A)  Madonna being Madonna in pasties with tassles, or B) making changes to retain the fame and external adulation she lives off of and has come to expect.  Here's the thing - SHE HAS A CHOICE!  If she chooses not to re-invent in a way that keeps her adored and beloved - that's on her...not society.  She doesn't get to start playing victim and whine and cry and moan<b>  \"Ageis</b>m!\" becau<b> se nobo</b>dy wants to see a fossil in a thong. <b>  If nob</b>ody wants to see a fossil in a thong - DO SOMETHING ELSE THAT PEOPLE WANT TO SEE IF STAYING ON TOP IS SO DAMN IMPORTANT TO YOU.  The public retains the right to want, or not want, what an artist is selling.  If she values her current brand more than popularity then that's her choice - start playing in smaller venues and accept personal responsibility for making that choice.  Otherwise do whatever is required to stay super-famous.  It's up to her.  She holds all the cards here.  But she doesn't get to play fake victim just because she can't have everything she wants her way.  That's just LIFE.  LOL",

The industry must always be on the look out for fresh talent, someone that can connect with a unique audience and newer generation. The older artist, while good, are not as hot, because, despite how we may feel about them, people actually get tired of paying their attention to the same Individuals. It's a business. They have to keep their eyes open for new talent and groom the new talent. Everything in life has its birth, growth, climax, decline, and then, death. I'm <b> old </b>enough to be realistic about this. Yes, the industry looks away from you the more you<b>  age</b> but, Madonna is personally struggling with aging more than any artist I've seen in a while. The older artist must be able to 'let go' and realize they have had their season and no things are permanent. She can still make music but, she shouldn't expect the industry to give a BIG push to a legendary artist. \nThey pushed the hell out of her in the late 80's and early 90's alongside Michael Jackson and others like, Cindy Lauper 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun'. You don't see Cindy Lauper trying to pull a Madonna these days.",

She's turning some folks off. She recently 'implied' that Cardi is only successful because Atlantic is giving her a BIG push. Well, doesn't every label, push artist who can command the public's attention? People have liked watching Cardi since she was on reality tv and it has trickled over into the rap scene. Nicki Minaj is becoming like Lil Kim when Nicki was the fresh artist. Lil Kim was hating, back then.Lil Kim is not as hot as she was in the 90's and early 2000's but, she's recently released an album and music videos. \nShe's still got her fans but, she cannot command huge market share anymore. Not only that, she looks ridiculous after all that plastic surgery on her face. She was so cute before. Her body ain't as sexy either but, she has done a terrible thing to her face.",

As a 21 year <b> old </b>female I can tell you the average young female is not interested in a casual, let alone<b>  sexual</b> relationship with any man who was born over a decade before her own birth year. Let's be honest, the average older man does not look like Idris Elba, Brad Pitt, or Johnny Depp (before he let himself go), therefore the average older man is not being checked for by women outside thei<b> r ag</b>e bracket. As a college student, I can assure you that the only thing that is attracting a 20-somethi<b> ng wom</b>an to <b> men </b>old enough to be her father is when those said men are sharing the big coins.

What stand out to me besides the overwhelming amount of procedures she has had to her face - She hasn't evolved since she made her album \"Ray of Light\".  If you listen to the lyrics of that album it talks about deep internal changes - growth.  She was evolving when she made that music and then, I don't know, maybe when she hit 50, she decided she had to keep up with the younger crowd to stay majorly relevant.  Her style choices, wearing grilz on her teeth, her music.  She used to have such unique sophisticated style that changed with every album she did.  Now she seems like a caricature of all the young pop stars. It makes me wonder if her talk about <b> ageism </b>isn't about fighting it, but an expression of her complete terror about aging and becoming even slightly irrelevant.",

Tell me there's no difference between her early work in the 00s and what she's done since Hard Candy in terms of quality. She really started following trends at that moment. I don't care about her surgery, the way she dresses, all that. I'm talking about music. As a fan, I would NEVER have thought she would collaborate with Nicki Minaj (THREE TIMES), someone the whole industry has already collaborated with. Now I'm afraid she might work with Cardi B and Migos. Justin Timberlake, Lil' Wayne, Nicki Minaj... What is she doing? Don't tell me she's not trying to appeal to a young audience. Her music has become immature. During Ray of Light, she used to flash her nipples too, and so what? The music was still wonderful. Now compare a timeless dance song like Music to a disposable one like Bitch I'm Madonna... The difference speaks for itself. Her last three albums are extremely weak and uninspired. Not because she's 60, but because she's Madonna, and she used to make great pop music. I wish she would see that instead of hiding behind the \"fighti<b> ng agei</b>sm\" excuse. Hopefully working with Mirwais will be fruitful since he produced two of her best albums. I really don't want her to retire, I just expect better music.",

But sadly instead of copying singers like Adele she copied the behavior and music style from singers like Miley Cirus Nicki Minaj and all the shitty ones, only to stay relevant. But if radios don't play her shit music it must be because they are <b> ageist </b>and sexist. Typical SJW mentality. I used to love both her and her music . Ray of Light was my nr.1 album ever, i was obsessed with it. Music too. And she was chill, calm, confident. Now she is just trash. It took me  a while to accept that i'm no longer a fan but i can't be a fan of someone with such a shitty personality, and crappy music. And her fans should grow the fuck up and stop licking her ass no matter what she does. Artists can fuck up. And she did. Big time",

But I feel with men, \"they may get called out on it too\" but the standard for them is lower than what is EXPECTED for women. That's like expecting a female pop star like Madonna to still look the same, sound the same, & be the same as time goes on. It's unrealistic & delusional, but when it comes to guys that same expectation/expectations aren't there as much. \n\nAside from that, she, Madonna needs to gracefully slow her role & be more of a role model & a \"mother\" instead of making out with various people on/off stage & swinging from poles half naked. I'd hate for the saying, \"once a hoe, always a hoe\" relate to her.",

First off, it's amazing on how all of you psychos come out of the wood work to defend these celebrities when they could give 3 fine shits about you or anyone. When you are in the public eye & KNOW people follow you & look up to you, in growing up with your music & such, (LIKE YOURSELF) in being an obvious fan it carries a responsibility in what you represent, do, look like, & say. If that's not something that's wanted or to be taken into consideration as far as responsibility then, that person is not fit to be in that position. \n\nYou can't have it both ways in saying, \"you don't care about what others think of you\" but yet STILL cater to what you may find is \"hip or trending\" in trying to stay relevant so that others will still be influenced & affected by you. Other than attempting to insult others, how about an intellectual rebuttal disclaiming these actual truths instead of being dismissive and childish.",

She thought for herself and did what she wanted to do instead of following the herd. She never was a victim and never portrayed herself as one. Now that she is older, she have subscribed to the Third Wave Feminist culture of victimology. Madonna should realize that she, as a <b> woman,</b> is actually more free to express herself than ANY man. NO MALE ARTIST, much less female, have gone as far as she had because men will get call out for it EVEN MORE.  Women think their roles in society are circumscribed...men are even more so.",

We're just not fortunate enough to be as high paid as her or have billionaire fortunes. My job is ordinary compared to hers and am not a celebrity like her, so no matter how hard i work (and i do), i'll never earn enough to undergo such plastics. \nYes, exercising and not eating McDonald's help you look young. But i'll ask you to look around at all 60 year olds you know, who exercise and eat carefully and tell me if any of them have that almost wrinkleless complexion of hers.\nMadonna is an athlete, and she's healthy, everyone knows how dedicated to sport she is. But she's had many plastics over the years to keep a young looking face. Eating well and exercising won't stop you from having wrinkles.\nI don't think i said anything wrong or offensive with my comment. It's facts and it's the truth.",

I'm 48, I could like many guys my <b> age </b>go that way, put weight on.  But I'm like hell no. I now train 8 times a week I take supplements, my diet is tight. I've been doing ketogenic diet for 5 year.  I am probably in better shape than I was in my 20s.  And I am criticised for it.  Apparently training that frequently is too much.  I should eat cake and 'be happy' people say oh I could never be like that.  But u know the traditional image of a 48/50 year<b>  old</b> is not something I identify with.  I remember 20+ years ago when Madonna was out training (bodyguards in tracksuits and Lycra ) and I was 19 at the time.  And for me, I personally found it inspiring.  That level of discipline and dedication.  I started to 'workout' (as I called it then) and it's something I have maintained to this day.  So for me, I feel like had it not been for those images back in the late eighties, I would not be the way I am now.  I think Madonna shines as an example that people should take inspiration from.  She is living life on her own terms. We all have the power to be who we want to be",

I guess not smoking and not drinking are also beneficial to keep a young look. But despite doing that, my father has wrinkles.. It also has to do with gen\u00e9tics i guess. I think, like Madonna, you should follow your lifestyle and be proud of it. Maybe the people who tease you are just jealous of your willpower :)",

Mariah ... JLO ... Janet all jumped on the Madonna highway of selling<b>  sex</b> as part of their image and as the<b> y ag</b>e they too will feel the sting of just how far can one take it.  Look at other strong female artists from the 80's still succeeding that didn't sell t<b> he s</b>ex at the level Madonna did... Pat Benatar, Stevie Nicks, Cyndi Lauper ... older than Madonna and not worried about selling 1 million or looking cool for the younger generation.  Of course Madonna has mega talent; but when will Madonna try and tell the world \"hey, i have talent beyond T&A\" and hope that it sells just as equal as before.  Final note.  i've seen comments on here that she is irrelevant or a has been...That, she is not and never will be.  Her legacy and contribution to pop culture forever changed the industry and set the standard for generations still to come.",

As far as anglianchannel goes the bullying you portray shows your insignificance to those who have some inteligence. In other words your not really worth arguing too because you dont have an opened mind and are far to opinionated to listen. Not only is anglianchannel an idiot, your a low grade idiot. Kevin your an extremist save your rhetoric for your looser friends. To all the haters and everyone who gave her hell remember she thanks you for your the ones who pushed her say she would not she should not she must not again Madonna said thank you.\n\nRemember all the controversy around her hanging on a cross during the confessions tour. This was not about religion christ or Catholicism it was about the children who as of that time there were 12,000,000 orphaned because their parents died of AIDS. The message was by 2010 the number of 12,000,000 would climb to 20,000,000. The message was about us as a species treating each other with kindness and respect. The message was we all need to be more like Christ. This part of her concert was such a spiritual and enlightening experience that it filled me with joy and sorrow. \n\nTo all the haters go on living in your distorted little existence and keep on believing your delusional mixed up messages that you get from the media the all seeing eye is watching you and they like what they see in you.\n\nRevolution of love = secretprojectrevolution\nCheck it out on youtube or are you to big of a <b> pussy </b>you cant handle the truth.",

No matter what religion she is, no matter what/who she believes in, it's her soul that is conscious. Our souls are immortal, I believe, to some point. I also believe she is a highly spiritual being. Many of those who left their bodies simply weren't able to continue their life on Earth in their form, as we knew it. That doesn't mean they're dead. This is what I believe in. However, you are right, too. We're both right, because we see things from different perspectives, based on our experiences, past lives, this life, etc., etc. All the best :)",

Then you might get an idea of how important she is.  If you can't figure it out than I feel Sorry for you.",

But apparently we read different books on her.  She still has done amazing things.  We'll just have to agree to disagree on this one and everything you said.  But, I also do yhink that everyone has a right to their own opinion.  So if that's yours, then fine.  Like I said before, whatever you want to believe.",
