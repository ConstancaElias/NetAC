Trump is currently 73, Biden is 76, Sanders is 77, Warren is 70, Klobuchar is 57, Williamson is \"66\". Adding 4 years to some of these candidates puts them past the WHO published life expectancy. 8 years puts many others at the limit. So, whatever they do in office (currently above the law as is Trump--or so he thinks) how much longer will they live everything else held even? Drought, war, famine, climate catastrophes, the POTUS is protected. Even after office they are protected from many events. Let them be able to live long after their administration to reap what they sowed.",

FDR didn't get to live after his administration. JFK didn't get to live after his administration. LBJ only lived three years after his administration. I'd (sort of ) understand if you were worried that he would die in office--sort of because the VP position exists for a reason--but worrying about whether they live after their administration seems silly. And I don't fully believe that this is your issue with Senator Sanders. Also, are you liking your own comments?",

The bigger picture is a burn with the donald again, or sink with a narrow minded aproach, or a  8 years of healing and admiration from the world stage,,,, we'll just have to see what it brings\n\n\npss; williamson is crashing from the pipe before the debate, grandpa joe and grandma warren  and ken doll hair swalwell are laughable.  this is going to be a real eye opener through the rest of the journey",

            "commentText": "Bernie is right on the <b> age </b>issue and Swalwell should have known better.  If you're going to talk about your generation, then talk about the new generation of leadership.  Period.  Swalwell missed a crucial point of JFK's line about the torch being passed, which he was grabbing on to.  JFK made the assertion AFTER he had been elected and inaugurated.  He didn't say the torch should be passed, but that it had been passed. The 1960 election had made that a fact.   Indeed, both Nixon and he were of a younger generation from FDR, Truman and<b>  Ike</b>.  After Swalwell is president (which won't be 2021, it looks like) he can make a comment like that in a positive way, as Kennedy did.  For this campaign, it was a clumsy and heavy-handed attempt to make Biden and Bernie look unfit for the Oval Office just because of thei<b> r ag</b>e.  What Swalwell could have done is to ask Bernie by what percent middle-class taxes would have to go up to pay for Medicare for All and by what percentage insurance premiums and medical costs would come down after an eight-year Sanders presidency.  Has Bernie ever stated those numbers?  If taxes go up 3.7% and costs come down 8.2%, well, we should just hold the election tomorrow, because Bernie wins in a landslide.  On the other hand, how many Americans fear that what will happen is that taxes will go up 3.7% and costs will come down 0.3% or even continue rising for some years, not because the idea of national health insurance is bad, but because the plan to require everyone to convert from private insurance to government insurance is faulty?",

                    "commentText": "You are missing the part about people not having to pay any premiums to health insurance companies.  To say that the out of pocket costs would do down by any percentage you quoted makes no sense. Bernie said this in 2016 but not often enough to get the message across.  I'm not understanding what your costs coming down 8.2% even means.  I know you meant to be hypothetical but it seems to me that the costs out of pocket would come down 100% if co-pays, deductibles and premiums are obliterated. Please explain because I'm not an expert on this issue. The only costs would be an increase in taxes.  Bernie needs to spell this out a bit better so people actually get it.  I don't think that people understood in 2016 and do not understand now that they wouldn't have any  of the current costs they currently have to pay.  But the GOP was afraid that people would figure this out. We know this because they attacked the health care systems  in other western countries and made bogus claims against them.  Most of that was fabricated or were isolated, anecdotal incidents and atypical.  People here were asked to ignore their OWN experience with our health care system---clinic wait times (notice how the mini clinics in stores and malls have sprouted up all over?), denial of care by the insurance companies, exponentially increasing premiums, having to change <b> doctors </b>because your employer's insurance changed, etc. etc.  Most of us have had at least one of those happen.  That message was not broadcast enough but unfortunately, the negative stuff was, most of which was not true. This is one issue that boggles my mind because I knew ,as you stated,  that if anyone actually thought about it, it's a no brainer.",

The split is a hyped up term by corporate media that was used to fuel the concession of sanders in 2016. The reason why they dont talk about modetate ideas (although a vast majority of the candidates are moderates, light republican hacks) is because they know it is deeply unpopular and because sanders' policies are huguely popular with working class and middle class americans throughout the country. Do u know that the corresponding party to republican party in sweden is nonexistent because they are regarded as rightwing extemists. Do u know that democratic party in terms of centrists and moderates is considered to be right wing here? Sanders' views are actually centrists here or regarded as center left which would the corporate media will never acknowledge because they are afraid they they will understand that his policies are the ones that working ppl/middle class has been desperate for over 40 years to take part of....",

Where I worked, I'm now retired, so many of us left around the same time that the persons in charge are floundering a bit. People have moved into supervisory positions after 1 or 2 years with very little experience actually doing the work and NO experience in management.  As a consequence, decisions are being made that aren't very sound.  In the past, people would retire at a much lower rate but there would be enough people around with experience that no one noticed any gaps.  I'm not saying that younger people don't have skills but it takes a bit longer than 1-2 years to see the bigger picture before making management decisions.",

Do I believe that healthcare is a human right? ABSOLUTELY! Do I believe that everyone in the U.S. should have access to affordable healthcare? WITHOUT QUESTION. HOWEVER, let that healthcare be what every individual thinks works for them, not one set system that was set up by a guy who has beef, though warranted in many cases, with the private insurance industry. \n\nHe even said that YES taxes would be raised, but never gave a number/percentage of how what it would be raised to. That should raise some eyebrows. What if that percentage is something that could effect someone paycheck more that they expected? \n\nHere's the reality. IF, and that's a strong if, Bernie gets elected, DO NOT THINK that he will walk into the White House, snap his fingers, and make this happen. The negotiations for this would go back and forth well into, if not dominate his entire first term. Ultimately, there will be a lot of compromises, and I can GUARANTEE that many of his most staunch supporters will turn on him? Why? Because he talked a good game when he was senator, but realized that the games changes when you become President.",

                    "commentText": "@Brent Foster Firat: Let's deal with why he says no to private insurance, you know what is a private company's judicial responsibility?  Maximizing profit! If a CEO does anything other than for maximizing the profit of a business he can be held liable in court. Meaning that no Private insurance is going to keep your interest at mind, and your interest, need I remind you, is staying alive. So first you don't privatize healthcare like it's an iphone. It's not a luxary provided by a free market, it's a necessity, provided by wait for it , ........ DRUMS........ SOCIALISSSMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. Which by definition means people pooling together for the <b> common </b>good of society. You know what else is not private and is socialized? Police, why? cuz regardless of your income you need their help. So if you leave healthcare to private market, here is what happens, they accept all the healthy people by offering very low prices while rejecting and unloading all the sick people into the public system which means profit for them, bankruptcy for our country and our sick people. Bernie says no I won't play this game with Brent's life. That's number 1. BTW healthcare itself is a socialist idea. No other major country treats healthcare as a commodity. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2, Well let's say I'm your avg Joe: My employer wont give me a raise because he is paying<b>  crazy</b> money for my insurance already. Likely, I'm underinsured with high deductable and copayments and premiums, so far I'm not winning with your system. But get this, Pharma charges me 2 times of that of a Canadian, or a French, why? They have power, while we paid for the research behind the drug they are selling us btw. , So I'm not really insured because maybe my deductible is $1000 and I'm part of the majority of Americans one 500 dollar bill away from bankruptcy. So how is this working so far? Bernie says hey Imma change the law and negotiate prices, and all of us will pay through a single payer which has more leverage over negotiations with Big Pharma, saving you drug money, while I'm actually giving you a \"Cadilac\" plan with no deductibles, no waiting, and bureaucracy, No co-payments, no premiums, just a bit more in taxes and your employer can also give you a raise now.  Our people have to call their insurance to see if they can go to thei<b> r doctor</b>s, Canadians call the<b> ir docto</b>rs for that. We can have that same situation here. \n\n\n\n\n3, he is the few candidates in over 200 years in this country who know how to get things done. And he never says imma compromise and make a deal with them, he says I need you to get involved if you want change, and we know that he will be the first president who will stand up to any big power with courage, be it Establishment Ds or Rs, be it top 1%, be it corporations Be it the pharma, be it the big agriculture, be it insurance companies, be it wall st, be it fossil fuel companies, be it military-industrial complex. Be it media. No president has ever done this and survived a full term alive.  That takes guts to say all these out loud and call on these powers to come and fight you. You dont see <b> how cr</b>azy that is? Courage OF BRINGING A POLITICAL REVOLUTION is how he does it.",

Could you imagine something like that happening and healthcare getting caught in the middle? That would be CATASTROPHIC! \n\nI'm not saying that the private insurance industry is full of saints and angels. Obviously, that's not the case. HOWEVER, being the capitalist society that we are, also full of flaws and issues, they have the right to pursue financial success. That being said, their greed is evident and needs to be dealt with.\n\nThrowing the baby out with the bath water is not the best idea for this. You still have not addressed the possibility that the tax increase that Bernie openly admits would happen could hit people much harder than they bargained for. That's why IF he becomes president, he will have NO CHOICE but to make deals. Get out of the illusion and DELUSION that Bernie Sanders is somehow above negotiation and compromise. \n\nThe private insurance industry is not just going to fold up its tents, lay-off all of its employees and somehow find other means of business just because Bernie Sanders says so. To believe that would be ridiculous.",

Close them down. \n\n\nAgain you didn't read my comment addressing how he will have the power to negotiate through a single payer. See if I buy a pen it might be 5 bucks but if you and I pool together to buy pens at wholesale we can get it at 2 bucks. The more of us in the same pool the less we each pay individually cuz of our buying power. Single Payer has immense power.\n\n\n BTW we are not nationalizing Healthcare like UK, we are just nationalizing the insurance which is where our money is pooled to help all of our people. <b> Doctors </b>and hospitals and pharma still work as a free market.

So how are we suddenly going to go from that to no costs for any American?  Also our employers pay most of the costs of health care for the 92% of Americans who have it, so now the full cost of health insurance falls on us. BRILLIANT!",

We pay more than anyone else in the world and get less.\n\n-Bernie's plan provides coverage for<b>  mental</b>, dental, eyeglasses, hearing aids, long term care and saves trillions of dollars because instead of paying 25% on admin expenses and paper works, Medicare would pay 3% for a simpler system. Medicare is the most popular healthcare system right now with 77% approval rating, and while VA has many issues to be fixed including hiring mor<b> e doctor</b>s, it still is one of the most popular programs with 78% approval ratings.\n\n\nToday, more than 30 million Americans still don't have health insurance and even more are underinsured. Even for those with insurance, costs are so high that medical bills are the number one cause of bankruptcy in the United States. Incredibly, we spend significantly more of our national GDP on this inadequate health care system\u2014far more per person than any other major country.

We must defeat them, together. That means:\n\n    Joining every other major country on Earth and guaranteeing health care to all people as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program.\n\nAnd to lower the prices of prescription drugs now, we need to:\n\n    Allow Medicare to negotiate with the big drug companies to lower prescription drug prices with the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Act.\n    Allow patients, pharmacists, and wholesalers to buy low-cost prescription drugs from Canada and other industrialized countries with the Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act.\n    Cut prescription drug prices in half, with the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act, by pegging prices to the median drug price in five major countries: Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan.",

                    "commentText": "@Meaningful Existence Thank you for continuing to post this. As someone who has been on Medicare now for 2 years, I wish people would talk more about the supplemental insurance we almost all have to purchase in addition to the Medicare Part B dollars that come out of our SS check. Plus, the fees and co-pays and deductibles still exist.  I understand that it's still cheaper but the health insurance industry has basically co-opted the Medicare system now as well.  Slowly but surely over time, Medicare is being privatized and most people haven't noticed!  We need to actually call it for what it is!  I haven't heard any candidate say this.\u00a0\n\n Prior to this year, we had Cost Plans, Advantage Plans and Medigap Plans.  Last year, they eliminated the Cost plans and I don't know why exactly.  I haven't been successful in finding out a good explanation for it. The reason provided didn't make sense to me but I suspect the Cost Plans had to be eliminated for the wholesale takeover to happen.\u00a0 \n\nThe premiums this year for these Advantage systems range from very little (under $50) a month to really expensive, in the hundreds of dollars a month.  Of course, the deductibles and co-pays are higher for the cheaper plans but for someone who is reasonably healthy, those are a good option.  Add this to the money deducted from SS and the premiums can be quite high for people living on a fixed income. I realize that this is a lot cheaper than many people have to pay in this country.  My complaint isn't necessarily about the dollars but rather how the insurance companies have been allowed to syphon off dollars from what is a Fed program by providing \"Medicare benefits.\"  I also know why we have to purchase these plans---because Medicare by itself doesn't cover what <b> doctors,</b> hospitals and clinics charge for services.  My point is that we are all in the same boat whether one is on Medicare, employer provided insurance or self-purchase.  \n\nWhen I received my Medicare book last fall, I counted 29 pages with 11 different products on a page. That's 319 options and I'm not even counting the Medigap plans!  It's extremely complicated and took me many hours over several days to figure out which plan to choose.  I had to compare provider networks, drug formularies, co-pays, deductibles, drug costs, etc.  And I'm a social worker who used to help clients on occasion do this but it's gotten much more complex with each passing year. There is a new industry whose sole purpose is to help people choose the best plan based on their individual circumstances. This is ridiculous and I don't believe anyone should have to go through this. The Feds have basically handed over Medicare to the insurance companies now and we all should be screaming about it.  It's a cash cow for them as the baby boomers have retired or will be retiring in the near future.  No one talks about it and I haven't heard Bernie mention this either. \n\nNote: I believe that this is one reason why people at Trump rallies held signs that said \"Keep your hands off my Medicare.\"  Many of us thought that was stupid at the time.  Didn't they know that Medicare was a Federal program?  I understand better now why those people felt threatened at losing their health insurance because to them, Medicare IS their supplemental or Medigap insurance company.  It's still private insurance as far as they are concerned because they pay a premium to the private insurance company every month!",

People are dying on the street, they don't have time to be on Starbucks, my friend. People would save money and get better healthcare like the top 9 healthcare systems in the world all of which are universal, cost-efficient and have better healthcare outcomes. \n\n\n\nToday, more than 30 million Americans still don't have health insurance and even more are underinsured. Even for those with insurance, costs are so high that medical bills are the number one cause of bankruptcy in the United States. Incredibly, we spend significantly more of our national GDP on this inadequate health care system\u2014far more per person than any other major country. And despite doing so, Americans have worse health outcomes and a higher infant mortality rate than countries that spend much less on health care. Our people deserve better.\n\nWe should be spending money on <b> doctors,</b> nurses,<b>  mental</b> health specialists, dentists, and other professionals who provide services to people and improve their lives. We must invest in the development of new drugs and technologies that cure disease and alleviate pain\u2014not wasting hundreds of billions of dollars a year on profiteering, huge executive compensation packages, and outrageous administrative costs.\n\nThe giant pharmaceutical and health insurance lobbies have spent billions of dollars over the past decades to ensure that their profits come before the health of the American people. We must defeat them, together. That means:\n\n    Joining every other major country on Earth and guaranteeing health care to all people as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program.\n\nAnd to lower the prices of prescription drugs now, we need to:\n\n    Allow Medicare to negotiate with the big drug companies to lower prescription drug prices with the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Act.\n    Allow patients, pharmacists, and wholesalers to buy low-cost prescription drugs from Canada and other industrialized countries with the Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act.\n    Cut prescription drug prices in half, with the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act, by pegging prices to the median drug price in five major countries: Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan.",

What this means is you make less than half what your father did.  Capitalism is Capital=Money ~ism=worship.  Or just more palatable name for plutocracy.  By allowing a few to corner the market on currency the country is now dying.  It's slavery all over but with a few steps added and a few terminologies changed.  People work full time and do not get enough to make ends meet.  Not because there isn't enough food, or there isn't enough housing, but because capitalism works to keep them poor and helpless so they may be more easily taken advantage of.

Which doesn't cover co-pays, deductibles, prescriptions, and the 20-30% after your deductible is met. It only covers 70-80% after you've met you deductible and it may not cover a procedure at all, or you may have to fight and provide them with a well documented case of what's going on. So almost everyone's taxes will raise slightly, but that private tax would be saved along with everything else it doesn't cover which could be thousands extra you wouldn't have to pay. So yes you will pay but less than just your monthly insurance bill costs you know. That's a decently large savings. Plus it'll save the country as whole trillions over a ten year period even according to the Cato institute. And that's because there would be a lot of middle men taken out of the equation. And everyone would be covered saving the government the money they spend paying hospitals that have no choice but to take of people that can't pay their bill. The system we have now is terrible and costs us much more than it should. Plus there's so many Americans without coverage, under covered, or they just can't afford to go even while being covered.",
