            "commentText": "I agree with Bill to some extent, but here I believe he falls into the same fallacy that many do. America is not ruled by the young. The millennial generation is only just beginning to assert generational dominance, the political, judicial, military, and industrial leadership of this country is still dominated by the Baby Boomer generation. It's why our country refuses to move forward, because so many of those in power think that progress is a bad thing, that things were perfect when they were young and the key to American success rests in recreating the circumstances of that supposed lost golden <b> age.</b> And this is a cross party problem, our leaders are blinded by nostalgia and ideological entrenchment. Experience is important, but more so is the ability to look forward rather than backward.",

First of all, <b> Jerry </b>Brown never even put his hat in the ring for president and secondly, the most popular candidates in the 2016 election were all in their late 60s or 70s.  When it comes to politics I think there's a more<b>  ageism</b> against younger candidates than older ones, but even then I don't think it's that strong.  I also think it's ironic that Bill implies here that Hillary was incompetent but suddenly thought she was the greatest after she \"won\" the Democratic nomination.  I totally agree with the ass thing though.  I'm a millenial and I think asses are gross (I blam<b> e blac</b>k culture for that whole fetish).  I'm still a boobs guy.",

Yes, some people might think that at 78 you become too <b> old </b>to be in government, but the same is true for young people too.

This may be true for some, but we shouldn't generalize it.\n\nInstead of worrying about whether or not someone is too young or too<b>  old</b>, we should start worrying about how qualified they are. Because no matter ho<b> w ol</b>d someone is, they can still be stupid, but they can also still be relevant and experienced, and no matter how young someone is, they can still be intelligent, but they can also still be inexperienced and unprepared. \n\nWe honestly should stop generalizing in a lot of different aspects...",

Another double edged sword to be added to the arsenal of intolerance. <b> Ageism.</b> Unfortunately when this works against the younger generations it isn't taken very seriously or heard of much.\n\nFlorida quite likely has the largest population of people who are retired or are at least of retirement<b>  age</b>. Because many of them are retired and have no need to work a consistent job. They have more time than most to allocate toward influencing county and state legislature naturally biased in their favor. This consistently includes cuts to school board and foster care funding, amongst other county and state resources particularly geared toward the welfare of children. They also frequent town hall meetings to advocate against allowing certain businesses that would attract young people to establish themselves in their city. They have also saturated the local real-estate economy, not only forcing young adult tax paying citizens and families into unsustainable and unlivable situations, but also working In cahoots with property management to set up communities specifically for themselves, hoarding property and retaining rights to a home that they only live at for 3 to 4 months out of a year.\n\nSo yea<b> h ageis</b>m is a bitch especially when it doesn't go your way.",

But I see women doing jerkwater jobs rather than raise their own kids!  Germans pay women to be their children's caregivers; it's a special job raising young productive citizens and no nanny can ever replace the women who can, at the moment, correct and help her child's behavior!  Diminishing their own roles as peacemakers, raisers of great men, and badgering men for the right to be as aggressive and warlike as men is a horrifyingly bad idea!  I love and respect our young; they fought so hard for Bernie and we need to work with Bernie's coalition in the next four years to build a solid base of progressivism so we can dominate the election in four years.  Grandparents can get along with their grandkids and they need maternal influences so when we meet, they are drawn to my understanding and desire to influence them in exciting ways!",

The BLM are protesting that too many <b> African </b>men are being killed by as in their view as the cops for  being<b>  racist</b>. It's not really abou<b> t rac</b>e at all but because of the stereotypes that t<b> he Afric</b>an American gang culture have produce. Although still morally wrong and some cases the fault of cops, the majority of blacks being reported killed by cops were warranted in defense of their own lives and or in the event that they were  committing a crime of an extreme circumstance. Chicago has the m<b> ost bl</b>ac<b> k on b</b>lack crime in the country and yet people expect cops not to be as a result a little prejudice. So  civil rights were fought for the color of one's skin not to be a subject for being excluded from ones right by their constitution.  BLM people think they are the same but in reality they are  fighting for the right not to be stereotyped. I'm latino and I know when I'm pulled over and the cops think I have drugs, I know it's not because of me or them to blame but towards the people <b> of my</b> race that is tied to criminals.

I look upon it as the climax of all misnomers, the boldest of all frauds, and the grossest of all libels. Never was there a clearer case of 'stealing the livery of the court of heaven to serve the devil in.' I am filled with unutterable loathing when I contemplate the religious pomp and show, together with the horrible inconsistencies, which every where surround me. We have men-stealers for ministers, women-whippers for missionaries, and cradle-plunderers for church members. The man who wields the blood-clotted cowskin during the week fills the pulpit on Sunday, and claims to be a minister of the meek and lowly Jesus. . . . The slave auctioneer's bell and the church-going bell chime in with each other, and the bitter cries of the heart-broken slave are drowned in the religious shouts of his pious master. Revivals of religion and revivals in the slave-trade go hand in hand together. The slave prison and the church stand near each other. The clanking of fetters and the rattling of chains in the prison, and the pious psalm and solemn prayer in the church, may be heard at the same time. The dealers in the bodies of men erect their stand in the presence of the pulpit, and they mutually help each other. The dealer gives his blood-stained gold to support the pulpit, and the pulpit, in return, covers his infernal business with the garb of Christianity. Here we have religion and robbery the allies of each other\u2014devils dressed in angels' robes, and hell presenting the semblance of paradise.\"Frederick Douglass",

What is it? Even pulling a shopping cart is dangerous in their hands.\n    I blame <b> age.</b> To be a good driver, and now it looks like a shopping cart puller or pusher, one has to learn early. More and more non-Asians, home spun people, are bad drivers. Single focused drivers~eyes planted straight ahead, never checking mirrors, (there are three of them in most cars), no awareness of those around them. And sorry, girls, but few of you seem conscious of road share; but don't feel bad, late learners of any persuasion ain't got the 'awareness' of what is not directly in front of 'em.\n    But I must point out, young Asian drivers, who have their experience and licences in their earlier teens are excellent drivers. Maybe a bit too fast, but that is youth.\n   If you want to be a concert pianist, star sportsman/woman, automobile driver, you must learn early and have a great trainer.",

It would be Bernie's win guaranteed. Look into it. Young people love Bernie and support him far more than any other candidate. So as you can see, there has been a meeting of the minds between Bernie, the oldest presidential candidate, and young voters. This happened based on ideas, and based on young people recognizing good ideas. We currently live in a country ruled b<b> y ol</b>d republicans who are put in power <b> by o</b>ld people voting.

I mean ppl do burp & sometimes throw up, sneeze, & cough. Not to mention ppl's breath usually stink unless they brush their teeth, use mouthwash, chew gum, or use breath freshers.

Another word for this is \"public works\", and there is little difference between \"job creation\" and building monuments to the caesars\u00a0-which attracts tourism, heh. As well, it attracts people to the \"lifestyle\" one can only find in Rome. So you're funding a small business, not a statue, but where is the money to buy from this small business? Is it not being taxed to fund small business, which is being taxed to pay \"sov-corp\" its cut? Oh, right, I forgot,\u00a0\"people matter\"!. XD",

Coral reefs are losing their hard shells due to the increased acidity and breaking off, which leaves many fish without a home and protection, which leads to their death.

The point of the Koch tax was to make solar energy not viable, thus making fossil fuels the only real choice, which puts MORE money into the Koch brothers pockets. Good god... good god, that wasn't hard to understand, but apparently for some people it is...\n\nAnd you realize the mega rich and large corporations pay almost <b> nothing </b>in taxes considering what they make right? To ask that they actually pay proportionally fair taxes considering their income brackets is not<b>  communist</b>, nor is it out of line. We have tax loop holes and out of country tax havens to thank for that...\n\nAnd people bitch about big oil because THEY BUY OFF POLITICIANS TO STOP CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS SO THEY MAKE MORE GOD DAMN MONEY!!!!

Plants that make products run on fossil fuels because their equipment does, because WE DON'T HAVE CLEAN SOLUTIONS YET!!!

Yep, no one wants affordable health care with better coverage than most have. Yep, no one wants to graduate from college without debt. Ugh, you are sooo right. Who could possibly want these things? (extreme sarcasm of course, I feel you would miss that if I didn't say so explicitly).\n\nAnd the rich not paying taxes is not a conspiracy theory. If you bothered to educate yourself... Tax havens are real. Did you just... miss the entire Panama papers scandal? THAT WAS ABOUT TAX HAVENS!!!!!!!! And how rich people across the world were using Panama as one. Trickle down economics doesn't work because corporations and the super wealthy hide profits out of the country for themselves, thus do not get taxed on it, and no, it doesn't come back to the employees. It just goes to line the pockets of the CEO's. You are beyond stupid to believe that isn't happening and there is simply no hope for you if you don't believe it.\n\nAnd... What the hell is your argument? You are talking about changing stuff today, but how all these jobs and money will be lost because we don't have the technology yata yata. Are you this stupid? Are you... this stupid? The answer is clearly yes.\n\nOf course WE CANNOT MAKE CERTAIN CHANGES UNTIL WE HAVE CLEAN ALTERNATIVES!!!!!!!!!!!! Jesus christ......\n\nIn the meantime, there ARE changes that can be made TODAY as far as regulating emissions while we develop clean alternatives. The god damn issue is, and has been big oil working to halt the progress of these alternatives by buying politicians. What happens when we move from fossil fuels to clean energy? Oh, they lose money... So why would they want it? Oh! They don't..... So they try to stop it.\u00a0\n\nThis comes in the form of stopping bills to add regulations to control emissions, to buying patents of clean energy alternatives and just sitting on them, halting their development (these things happen and can be found if you bothered to educate yourself), to the Koch brothers controlling media and countless politicians to do things like make it unreasonable for people to power their private homes with solar energy instead of relying on the power plants, which add to emissions by getting politicians to impose a tax on it.\n\nAnd... cutting down trees for clean energy? You lost me... There are places for panels all over, why they would need to go needlessly chop down trees for them is beyond any intelligent person's comprehension.\u00a0\n\nAnd you sound like you don't think the Koch brothers are evil... This... this is where you lose any credibility. If you defend them in any way, shape, or form. No one will take you seriously because those of us with more than an 8th grade education know what they have been doing.",

This gets sent out to tax safe havens, yes, countries that have incredibly low taxes. Meanwhile, the middle class are storing their money in US banks. Income taxes are taken out and taxes must be paid on how much was earned etc, etc... That doesn't happen to the money stored in safe havens. Income taxes are not collected on it because it basically \"doesn't exist\" in this country. That money is not included in how much they made when it comes to taxes. So no, it is un-American to do this. Taxes are required to build infrastructure and support government and courts, schools, hospitals, \u00a0etc. But the rich don't pay the taxes that should be, sooooo it comes on the middle class to make up what is missing.\n\nLook at the state of Kansas and Louisiana that have Conservative tax plans. They went from a surplus of income, to massive debt. They are threatening closing down schools and hospitals because the government has no money to support them. Those states are in complete shambles because of \u00a0idiotic Conservative trickle down tax plans that greatly cut the taxes on the rich.\n\nCrawl back into your cave until you evolve more.",

Call me <b> crazy,</b> but I think it's entirely possible for someone to be an intellectually vacuous loser during their youth and still be an intellectually vacuous loser by the time they're pushing 80. Doesn't matter how many years you give 'em, those who refuse to learn simply won't learn.\n\nOf course, I suppose one could always make the argument that Robertson is actually a genius for manipulating as many weak minds as he does, and that even he doesn't truly believe the bullshit that comes out of his mouth. But even if that were true, it would only be evidence that not all geniuses are worth listening to, not evidence supporting why we should hold arbitrary reverence for our elders.",

Socialism and socialism in effect(i.e. the social democracy) are two very different things. I can tell by his name that Matthias Byheden is Danish. \n\nThe Danes don't have socialism, they have a social democracy. They pay a very high tax which is then destributed into various social interests such as healthcare and education, that benefit the middleclass, which makes up the largest percentage of any western population. \n\nNow in the States most of the social services Matthias grew up with are privaticed, so you'd have to claim them with your own capital. Now this might sound great because you pay less tax and only pay for the services you need. But it also means that when you do need said services, which most people will, you're at the mercy of the corporations that own these services. They're free to charge you anywhere from 1 dollar to 1 trillion dollars. \n\nSeeing as most of the American working class will rely on services like healthcare and education, Mattias, with his high tax, will actually walk away with more disposable income than you. More to the point, because Mattias has free access to crucial social services, he can pursue a life without being dictated by income. So in his pursuit of happiness the final destination is actually happiness, whereas in the American pursuit of happiness, happiness really means wealth. I've always found this ironic, seeing as it's your own phrase XD \n\nOf course the system isn't without flaw, and because your tax is adjusted to your income(the more you earn, the more you pay), it is A LOT harder to become a millionaire... But there's a reason they call it the top 1%.",

I'm glad you asked because ''better career choices'' in your end means really means ''better paying choices''. Now unlike you I actually grew up rich. Not \u00fcber rich, but absolutely in the top 20%. But I teach school children. This is not a lack of trying nor a poor career choice, this is something I genuinely find exciting and it makes me happy. And because I live in a social democracy, I too am Danish, I can actually make a decent living off of it. I am comfortable with the idea that I will never become a rich man. I will never be a millionaire, but I'm very, very happy. \n\nNow I want to make it very clear that <b> nobody </b>is paying for me, because I too pay tax, and I still pay more than any American. Also because so much tax goes into education, the level of education in public universities is no lower than the private universities, so we have no equavelant to your IVY league universities. We do have expensive private universities, but they're worth no more on a resum\u00e9 than a public education. So most of Denmark's top 1%, including our royal family, went to public university, and so they too have used the system. \n\nNow if your tax went up and you had to pay more, you would, from a certain perspective, be supporting others. But is the happiness and security of your fellow countrymen not worth it? I mean looking from the outside it seems like you genuinely despise each other. The problem is that not all people are inheirently bright enough to make ambitious choices so you can A. Leave behind or B. Allow them to live a decent life with a profession they can be productive in.\n\nI mean for fuck sake, you have people calling universal healthcare the work of satan and communism while coughing up blood!!! The only conclusion I can come to is that<b>  nobody</b> in America sees themselves as poor, but rather, because of this ''American dream'' idea , see themselves as temporarily inconvenienced billionaires. Is this true? That was a real question btw, I genuinely want to know.",

Let me start off by saying that I'm going into petroleum engineering which will net me around $100,000-$150,000 a year. At the current tax rate that means I'm going to have to pay between 20,000-30,000 a year in income taxes alone. So right off the bat you can see why raising taxes would elicit such an angry response from me and others like me. I'm not sure how things are in Denmark but in America the lowest class is looked down upon as leaches and not without reason. The average cost of keeping one person on welfare in the states is $25,000 a year. That's disgusting. So no I have no desire to help those people in the least. As for healthcare I can afford my own and I don't want to be forced to pay for benefits I'll never use.

The government won't hand you the bill for Donna's labour. I can't see how your tax situation would affect you emotionally, cause like I wrote I, a 27 year<b>  old</b> working class, pay much, much more than that. \n\nAs for the poorest, who we weren't discussing, you'd imagine welfare leeches would be a problem with our system, but we have an effective solution. This is the problem with American politics, the slightest suggestion that you could learn from other nations, and the republicans and southern liberals cut your hand off, politically speaking, for even hinting that the US might not be the best at everything. \n\nWell the solution is called ''activation'', and what it does is that if you've been on welfare for more than 3 months, the government will find you a place to work, and your pay will be your welfare check, which is less than what the job would actually make you, thus encouraging you to get a real job. This ensures only those who genuinely need welfare get it, because the alternative to a real pay check takes just as much work, but pays less.\n\nAlso you're 22 mate, it's a little early for the victory tour.

And like I wrote, your tax is not paying healthcare, it's paying everything.

Worldwide American approval ratings have gone down quite a bit with the Trump presidency, and people are generalising Americans like it's going out of fashion. It's not fair, and I thought I was above it, but clearly it's starting to rub off.\n\nYou know I'm a teacher, but I have a degree in anthropology(human behavior), and my final exam was a piece on higher education around the world, and I did extensive research into the American educational system, and I'm afraid things are as bad as they seem. I don't practise alternative fact, numbers don't lie. \n\nI think it's great that you were able to make it on your own, truly, and so I sort of understand why you'd think that all it takes is to roll up your sleeves and get to work, and it is a romantic notion, but the sad truth is that some people just don't have that kind of drive. Flushing tax money into social services would allow those people to live a decent life with the cards they're dealt. \n\nI'd like to tell you something about myself. I suffer from a very mild case of epilepsy. I can be without seisures with medicine, I can even drive, but it is a chronic disease, I will have to take medicine every day for the rest of my life. In America I could not live the kind of decent lifestyle I have now. That's not fair, it's certainly not freedom, because I didn't choose to be ill.  \n\nYou can't realistically ''sink'' to our level, but at least make it realistic for a weaker individual to make it. For instance remove the ability for insurance companies to deny you because of pre existing conditions. I recently read an article about a baby being denied health insurance, because it was slightly overweight... That's not just wrong, it's downright cruel. \n\nSocial tax would also help with issues like obesity. I believe the stereotype that all Americans are unintelligent is ridiculous, but the thing about stereotypes is that they're always based on watered down truth. We can disguss numbers all day, but the fact is that many Americans are grossly ill informed. Easy access to education would solve this. It'd also annialate FOX news ;)\n\nLook you have your own opinion, and you're entitled to it, but I just can't see how you can claim socialism will fail, when our working class has a much higher standard of living than yours.",

So when these punk liberal arts majors living on their parents dime, working a day a week if that, and still getting worse grades then me complain about not being able to afford classes and not getting enough help from the government they're not oppressed they're lazy. \nI would argue that. Your income taxes are what, 50%? Cut that in half, more for school teachers, and you would be able to afford health insurance in America. \nAs for that child it's a shame but the insurance company was protecting their business.

You can't run a company like that.\nI'm not sure how you say that Denmark has a better standard of living then the states considering the cutthroat rate you're taxed at and the fact that the American middle class makes on average between 50-140,000 annually, double that of your country.",

We also have a much narrower wealth gap than you, and we have no absolute poverty, and you do. \n\nIn case you're wondering there are two pillars of lower class poverty. The most <b> common </b>in western nations is relative poverty. Relative poverty means you're poor relative to your<b>  nation</b>'s standard of living. You can feed yourself, but you won't spend a romantic summer in Paris. Absolute poverty means you're actually having serious problems taking care of yourself, and you're one payment away from eviction. This is what you sometimes refer to as ''trailer trash''. \n\nSadly this also means you have the highest percentage of child poverty of any wester<b> n natio</b>n. If you still think privatised medicine is a good idea, then consider this. Not only do you have the lowest life expectancy of any weste<b> rn nati</b>on, you also have the heighest infant mortality rate. Which is heartbreaking. This is why I say that looking from the outside, it seems that you genuinely despise each other. The top 30% must know this, and yet they're not willing to have their tax raised. Look, if you cut your defense spending, which is way too high, raise working class tax 15%, and tax the 1% as much as the working class, those numbers would improve dramatically. \n\nYou have inner city schools that spend more on metal detectors and security than books which is just mad. And introducing advanced pedagogy to education would also help at risk students. \n\nIt's hard to say how much people here pay, because  tax is adjusted. People in my field usually pay around 40%, although I pay 50% because my master's degree gives me a slight pay raise, as does my Ph.D(wasn't going to mention that because it seems like boasting, but in this instance it's relevant). \n\nA slight tax raise would also enable you to look into the enviroment. I know many conservatives don't give two shits about this, but if you've ever been to Los Angeles, you'd know what I'm on about. As for my hypothetical life in America, I'm not sure you're right. My epilepsy didn't ''wake up'' till I was 14, however I was born with eczema. It went away after a few years, but it's still a pre-existing condition. I'm sorry if seem a bit zealous, but I just don't see how you can put a price on being healthy.",

I can't agree with your first point. $100,000 a year with 20% tax and less then $10,000 for for all of the same benefits is more then $40,000 with 50% + tax if not more, you don't need to be an engineer to see that. As for the wealth gap that argument is extremely weak when you start to analyze what it really means. Does it really matter that people like Bill Gates makes billions of dollars a year and I'll make maybe $250,000 annually by the end of my career? No. I want to do well for myself and I couldn't care less if 1% makes an outrageous amount of money. Yes Denmark has a small wealth gap but at the same time the average person is much poorer then the average American for it.\nRaising the taxes by 75% is completely unacceptable. Yes the infant mortality rate is high in America but the lives if 1.6% of children born is not an adequate reason for such an unreasonable <b> hike </b>in taxes. The defense budget is too expensive, I'll give you that. Personally I don't think we should spend a dime protecting nations that don't want us in the first place.\nThe reasons the inner city's spend so much on security equipment is because the gang culture breeds violence, they really are necessary to keep the schools safe.\nBoast all you want, a PH.D is something to be proud of.\nI don't really have an opinion on the environment. I don't live near Los Angeles but all of the other cities I've been to a remarkably clean with the exception of Pittsburgh.\nI don't put a price on my personal health, but I'm not going to pay someone else's hospital bill.\nAs for your final point let me put it like this: Denmark has a population of smaller then that of New York City. Do you really expect us to take the option of such a if relatively small country seriously?",

I'm thinking what you ment to write was ''do you expect to take the opinions of such a small country seriously?''. If this is true, then I have to ask you to slow down, because you can't rule a <b> nation </b>irrelevant because of its size. The Vatican, which is actually a country, has the world's smallest population... Yet they house the richest and most influential corporation in the world, the Catholic church. \n\nAlso we're actually quite a large country, because Greenland is Danish territory, and we haven't granted them independance yet. Although to be fair their total population is 50.000. I will absolutely agree that Americans have higher income than us, but our standard of living is still higher than yours because our tax is spent on shit which makes our lives better. Feel free to look it up. Apparently we're also happier. And Copenhagen is the cleanest capital in the world, and trust me mate, you can tell. \n\nI'm a bit curious, have you ever left the States? Also in which city do you live. I'm thinking Houston, or somewhere in Texas. Your name is a bit southern, very strong, and oil is big business in Texas.",

I understand what a utopia really is, sir. A utopia is propaganda for a vicious tyranny. Utopias aren't real, have never been real, and by the simple rules of logic, cannot ever truly exist. So anybody trying to sell you on the idea of a great utopia is ALWAYS, whether wittingly or unwittingly, doing leg work for a vicious tyranny that plans to masquerade as a utopian state for as long as possible before the inevitable crackdown. There's not an odious, tyrannical state in all of Human History that did not have at least one day as a shining, golden city on a hill. It all goes back to a guy named Nimrod. Everything you say sounds exactly like the kind of horseshit he used to talk about and he died at least 6,000 years before you were born, dude. Give me a break. Time to grow up, son. You sound just like Hitler in Mein Kampf, too. Go read it, you'd be surprised how progressive and classically liberal he thought he was going to be. What a free and open State Germany was going to be in his dreams. Perfect justice, no corruption, etc, etc. You sound exactly like every brutal dictator does at the beginning. And as an avid student of History, YES, I will die resisting you! No hesitation and no regret. We are mortal enemies, sir. We always have been since before we were born, we always will be long after we are both dead and gone. I'm born to be a free human, you were born to be a tyrant. We are not the same species.",

Look at Hitler, textbook example. Just smart enough to outsmart himself, in the end, because he made the classic mistake all smart people are prone to: He forgot that other people could disagree with him and still be intelligent. Sounds like your problem too. You know, I'd bet more than half of what you classify as your own intelligence is actually <b> nothing </b>more than intellectual vanity. Big difference between the two.",

Meaning the end of welfare, the end of capitalism, and the placement of the means of production in the hands of workers? No? Then he's not a socialist. FYI, he's a left of center social democrat who still believes in capitalism as a system but wants to improve quality of life while leaving the economy privatized (instead of socializing it like a socialist or <b> communist,</b> or nationalizing it like a fascist). He's a big proponent of the Scandinavian model, which is very much a capitalist system. So now you know.",

Social democracy is left of center, and espouses many socialist ideals, but the fact still stands that it is a capitalist system with socialist elements, not a socialist country. Left of that is democratic socialism, and left of that is pure socialism. Social democrats like Bernie have a lot of really great ideas and could establish a great deal of good in the world, but in truth, he's not a full socialist (as he does NOT believe in social ownership of the means of production, at least not in practical terms).",

Again, he's also not a democratic socialist really since he doesn't believe that we should have social ownership of the means of production, but yes, he's on the socialist spectrum of beliefs. But yes, regardless, we both support him and his beliefs, so it's important to be in favor of him. But I think that he would be a lot more electable to more people if his supporters would always clarify that he is a social democrat who does NOT want a full move to socialism. While I would probably be even happier if his views were more extreme, I also think he would be less electable, so I'm glad that he's not a pure socialist",

            "commentText": "Ok so here's my thought. <b> Age </b>has a factor especially when it comes to governing. I mean one of the reasons why the Middle East has failed is because a lot of the leaders are in the 60-85<b>  age</b> group. Yes wisdom has a key in this but in my opinio<b> n elderl</b>y should play roles such as counseling or advisers rather than Presidents. Someone who can be a part of something but from the \"Small Council\". Having a young leader is not a sign of disrespect but you need someone who can think like the generation that is currently active and who hold the key to the future rather than a leader who is thinking it's still 1950. If a candidate has what it takes and he<b> 's o</b>ld then by all means. But if he's going to bring t<b> he \"</b>old tricks\" which would've worked back in the 70's then I'd rather have another one.\n\nYes Millennials suck big times. We had the spoils of our hard working parents. The 80's and 90's were a lot of fun. We sucked at school and we had boy bands (yes I know The Beatles could be considered as boy bands but I'm talking about...will you know what I'm talking about). So no wonder we stare at asses. But that doesn't mean that's it.\n\nAny way. Feel free to agree or disagree.",

Even when the twenty somethings are dropping like flies.\n\u00a0I don't hang out in top 40 bars... never have, even when i was young; because a straight male dancing in that environment, is still to this day, liable to get in a fight over it.

I was born in one of the last years of the millennials and most people my<b>  age</b> baffle the shit out of me. We as a generation are too self-centered, egotistical, narcissistic and centered on material goods and wealth than anything else. We care little for politics, economics and news and instead are interested in what celebrity is doing what and the newest and best products to buy. I don't hate my generation, but saying I am disappointed with us would be an understatement. We are straying into an individualistic mindset and that is distressing, but I ask older generations and people of my generation to not make assumptions and generalize us because in that 'we' is included many different people. Most of the people that are seen on tv and the internet today that are of our generation doesn't reflect many of us and what we value. The normal everyday Generation Y's are not the ones you see in the media, because today 'news' is not about facts and relevant stories it is about what is 'interesting' and what will get someones attention to make them stay on the channel. Normal people just aren't interesting enough for us anymore.",

And even though there are a minority of atheist trolls, that is no more a reason to judge the group than it is to decide that all evangelicals are closet homosexuals, because a few have been outed like Ted Haggard.\n\nI had been promised an equity stake in my company if I achieved certain goals, which I greatly exceeded. The Company was owned by devout Christians. But before the year was done, and the final results were in, I happened to be at a bar one night with the President of the company who kept badgering me to come and join his church. I finally broke down and told him that I was an atheist - something I had carefully hidden for 4 years. After that, I was no longer invited to board meetings unless my expertise was absolutely required, I never got another raise (I had been getting them about every 6 months) and my division of the company was moved to a holding company and out from under the company I had been working with. The result was that at year's end, they were legally able to honor their contract with me by giving me 2% of the nearly worthless holding company. When the company I actually did the work for was sold a couple of years later with a net profit of 5 million dollars I should have gotten $100,000, but I got almost <b> nothing.</b> At the same time, they liquidated the holding company and I got 2% of it's $10,000 valuation\u00a0 - about $200.\n\nI never spoke about religion except one time, when, after a few beers, I wanted to stop my boss from pestering me to come to his church.\n\nA group of conservative Christians at my club/marina tried to have me kicked out when they found out through a 3rd party that I am an atheist. I don't even associate with them - i never insulted, badgered or bothered them.\n\nThese are just two incidents that happened to me personally. There have been more, and several of my friends have had such experiences too. So please don't tell me about how it's our fault, or it's not really a prejudice. I made more money for my bosses in my last 3 years than any other TWO people combined, and they screwed me.",

This may not meet the legal definition of prejudice but I'm talking about the general definition.\n\nAnd for the voter who doesn't vote for atheists, they also are not being prejudice unless they are PRE judging. See, there's the PRE again. They would have to make a connection between atheism and some other PRE-assumed quality in order to call this prejudice. And that's why you threw in the quality of \"they are not trusted in office\" i.e. Bad policy maker. In that case it WOULD be prejudice. In other words if you are making the connection atheism=bad policy maker then yep, that's prejudice. But many people DONT. there are many people who are this type of voter but if asked do you think the atheist will make for bad policy, they will say no, I just don't want to see an atheist in that office. You see, no PRE judgment. Just a dick voter. The only thing they claim to know about the candidate is that they're atheist and that is TRUE. They are atheist. No bad assumptions involved. Just a person who votes very stupidly.",

I was little, but even remember the tense cold war near the end of it.. \u00a0The rich got very rich in my generation.\u00a0\nThe good music is all gone, there is <b> nothing </b>more technologically that is changing the world.. we're living in a stagnant era. Obama is not the hope or the change we expected, the appearance of our country is packaged to look neat and not so shabby, but in reality is a piece of crap that you can't lend any money to because it has such bad credit. The prison and military have made fortunes for many and because of it, we can't get rid of bombs and bullets fast enough.. nor can we stop the persistent revolving of cell doors to house prisoners. Since the business part of it has us stuck in its wake. The banks are greedily, and even criminally sucking us dry, very often legally, because they count fines within their profit risk.. and<b>  nobody</b> specifically is to blame and jail when a company makes group decisions.. papers get lost. Its a big fuckin joke. Corruption is higher than its ever been.. and everything \u00a0just fuckin sucks... On top of that<b> , racis</b>m is alive and well.. if not thriving.. thanks to the cherry fuckin syrup of all the recent beatings <b> of bla</b>ck citizens by law enforcement. Regard for human life is out the window... we're devolving into shit.. The generation fucking sucks ass... DONT HAVE KIDS! Its a sentence to a fucked up life... wait 10-15 years and determine if you have the time.. cause this time just fuckin sucks.",

I'm 28 and I guess part of the millennial generation, but those lazy inconsiderate Baby Boomers let our country go down the drain. Our grandparents i.e. the 80-90 yo are the greatest generation surviving two world wars and an experiment called America (~<150 yo). Without our grandparents, your parents, we would not have an America (maybe a Germany, but not America). The Baby Boomers are a generation that think they are entitled to something and to give them power to drive our economy further into oblivion is just plain stupid. They argued against Vietnam, but are A okay with Afghanistan and Iraq. Could it be that they were okay with the\u00a0Iraq and Afghanistan wars because they no longer had to fight (dare I say the Baby Boomers are cowards!)? It's a joke and a travesty to hand our government to people that screwed it up in the first place and are okay to send young people to war in their place but dodged the Vietnam war if they could. Oh wait, it's still in their grasp, so stop saying that young people can't govern or can't think logically about the issues, because the way we millennials see it is that\u00a0we need to get into power and stop giving the Baby Boomers any\u00a0more to take from this country (Social Security, Medicare, pensions, etc.) which we\u00a0may not have when we are 60-70 yo.\u00a0\n\nA little shift here, but to make our country better overall would be to have term limits in Congress just like the President has, thus ending the oligarchy and the corporate control. But, that won't happen until the poor are really poor and there is no more middle class, thus causing revolution. I digress and thus will end the comment.",

Young people don't turn out during midterm elections and the establishment in both parties knew that. That's why the candidates spent much of the time talking about perpetuating war in the middle east, denying climate change and dragging their feet on social issues. Hardly any of the candidates made any effort to relate to issues that matter to people in their 20s and 30s. And they were right; young people stayed home, and the older electorate sent more science-denying bigots to the senate and gave the party of \"no\" control of both houses of congress. This country is already completely run by the <b> elderly,</b> and that needs to change.",

(I.e. record labels promoting songs about the female posterior are not run by young people. )\n\n2)  The people in Bill's generation didnt believe in saving like their depression era parents did.  They believed in spending and having a good time, borrowing money, and living larger than their means which in turn wrecked the economy twice very severely.   As a result of this, Bill's generation doesn't have alot to retire on so instead of stepping aside from the workforce they have to stay in, preventing young people from getting career oriented,  middle class jobs.\n\nSo blame young people if you want but look at the whole picture first.",

That's where his rant just comes off as petty and a last cry of \"back in my day\" type of attitude towards the youth.

Even though his personality is magnetic to the zombie viewers and I do watch him along with other late-night news hosts such as Colbert and Jon, I happen to disagree with him the most. Sure, he is hilarious and has a very similar personality to mine, which is why I find him so appealing and entertaining to watch and play around with his (biased) opinions, but that doesn't mean he is a perfect human being. Turn your Maher-Blinders off and actually LISTEN to the ideas he is saying- in this case, he's talking down on our generation, Gen X and Y. Yes, I am disguisted by the things that we happen to worship, such as the human buttocks and Miley Cirus, and I do happen to love Larry King, but the progressive perspective of our generation are THE most relevant ideas for the world and how it is shaped, we are the future and it is now our turn to shine. WE created Facebook, Google and letting technology and letting far-left liberal policies slowly take over the country. <b> Old </b>people like Bill are in our way, but our views are only getting more powerful by day.\nWhat I'm saying is, the younger generation right now is the future and we are as relevant as anything, no matter what anyone says.",

Well whats in heaven? humans. Humans cannot escape human nature. If heaven did exist, it wouldn't be long before humans started setting up their corporations and destroying it and turning it into a toxic waste dump.

Well you should know that many of those folks are in debt because they have kids that need to go to college. Credit card debt are not forgiven for everyone. Many have kids and parents to take care of. And ask your mom to see if she paid for anything for you with a credit card. I am disgusted by some people in our generation. But at the same time, I am very proud that many of us had made a difference. You, however, are sitting here asking your college education to be free. Maybe you should consider finishing it first since you are only 20 and probably don't have much debt just yet. Talk about it when you graduate... if that ever happens.",

It could be shared, across the board, except Gen Z because they are too young yet and they are watching our actions, collectively, and learning from us. Generation X and the boomers have a part of blame, in where we are today, as well. After WW2, when industry picked up in America and the activism of the 60's, took off, we were a <b> nation </b>of ideals, fresh ideas and innovation (we still are, of course), but we got careless. Now we have that activism, turned political correctness, dictating what is acceptable and what is not. We all share a part of the blame for that. Millennials we're dealt a bad hand, inherited many pitfalls, like an inflated economy, rampant politically correct enforced thought, that dictates what individuality is and what is cannot be, and a very uncertain future. Ultimately, maybe everyone is in that boat, now. If the millennials are guilty of anything, it is not caring enough about where society, is going. Many of them are working part time jobs (multiple jobs), just to work to attain a future they have no real assurance, even will exist. Carelessness and uncertainty are everywhere. What I see much of the problem, as being, is people who follow this societal trend of political correctness, without questioning where it is leading our collective futures and people who have a \"generational\" mindset and want to play the blame game, without assuming any themselves. We already have too much of that. Collectively, we are a living society of responsibility shirkers (generally speaking here). Maybe this is going to be our demise, as a society, one can only hope not.",

While they promoted \"free love\" (excuse me again) and peace, sitting passively by, watching, as bureaucratic assholes slowly, but surely, undermined everything that gave America real prominence in the world. And they didn't have to rack up 100k in debt, in the false hope that opportunity and prosperity was on the other side of higher education. All the while selling Generation Y and Z's future, down the river, on a ship called Free Trade. And now, we are decrying carbon emissions, telling this generation they need to \"Be responsible\", while the baby boomers wasted, like there was no tomorrow. And maybe now there really is, \"no tomorrow\". You can't help that kind of ignorance.\n\nGeneration X, Y and Z now get to engage a daily struggle to hold onto jobs, they aren't guaranteed to have, in 5 or 10 years. While the baby boomers will get the full circle return of not championing the benefits, they were given, when the pension fund runs out in a few years because more boomers will be retiring, while fewer will be paying back into the fund. That is, unless the global economy goes, belly up, when the dollar (the world reserve currency), finally is declared worthless because it is being over printed.\n\nAll this bullshit because of a failure to take responsibility. We should stop beating the dead horse, of telling the youth to be more responsible and get their priorities straight, and face the facts for what they are.\n\nFuck it, I haven't even touched on wars and international disasters, but this rant has been long-winded enough.",

There are many criticisms that can be made of my generation, but I would not say a lacking in a sense of social justice and environmental awareness is one of them.\n\nI don't know the statistics, but I'd bet that compared to past generations millenials generally accept the reality of global warming on a wider scale. I know for a fact less of us are <b> dumb </b>enough to believe in a god, so we're already more inclined to be convinced by scientific data, something that often prevents older generations (in my experience) from believing in things like climate change.\u00a0\n\nI ask this of you and everyone so quick to judge my generation; Think your criticisms through at least. I understand some level of disappointment towards people my<b>  age</b>, we certainly aren' perfect, but we have greater potential, in my opinion, than any of you do at this point. Also, the more bitter you people sound the less inclined your criticisms are to actually make any change, as we young folk tend to rebel against any form of authority because we're young and think we know everything. ;P\n\nFor the most part, all I'm saying is you could give us more credit and express your expectations in a more constructive way considering the advantages we have in terms of both development and information distribution.

Your generation hasn't had a real chance to make any impact, and I doubt you know very many of them individually. Even if you did, you don't know what's actually going on in their head. If you haven't found something to like about your generation, you aren't even looking. Homosexuality is most accepted by your generation, just as an example. However, they accept their sexuality, like asses, and buy a new phone every few months, so clearly they're awful right? No.",

The only way a person or <b> nation </b>grows is by learning and applying that knowledge. It's great to learn from history but conservatives want to repeat history and that NEVER works.\n\n\u00a0In the U.S. there is ONLY conservatism. Neither party is interested in learning\u00a0from our mistakes. The Republicans want to go back to them, (hence the fixation on making the rich richer - even though the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries told us that making the rich richer only makes the poor poorer and SLOWS DOWN THE ECONOMY), while the Democrats want a law for every part of our daily lives. (How did that work in the U.S.S.R., or the P.R.C. or the P.R.K., to site an ongoing totalitarian regime?)\n\n\u00a0Face it, our present political system;\u00a0an oligarchy in all but name,\u00a0is\u00a0broken badly and quickly destroying the country.\u00a0Both political parties are really run by a few very wealthy, very self interested business entities. In a few years, unless these\u00a0entities are curtailed, we the people will be<b>  nothing</b> but wage slaves (as many already are) working long hours to benefit those very few at the expense of our own desires and dreams.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0One possible answer is true Libertarianism, the way Robert Heinlein described it, before the conservatives latched onto it and made it much like the present oligarchical system. Heinlein described Libertarianism as a system where minimal constraint was put on the individual while the corporate structure was firmly regulated, (oversimplified but basically what he was saying, I think). What that means is: Let the individual be free to think and create and make sure that no one who is rich can stifle that freedom, by statute or by stealing.\n\n\u00a0From the mind of the individual comes the greatest of ideas: The Declaration of Independence, the telephone, the computer, the airplane, the automobile. The list is endless. I believe that if this country is going to remain at the forefront of human freedom, the only way t o do it is to throw off the oncoming tyranny before it clamps down on us all. We do that by finding the independent thinkers and electing them DESPITE the constant bombardment of lies by a media, again, run by those few very rich and very self interested entities...\u00a0\n\n\u00a9Caelroigh Blunt 2014",

Hell, earlier in the show he made a crack about Pat Robertson, who is himself a crotchety<b>  old</b> fart that I doubt anyone sane would label as wise. No, what he's saying is that older people lik<b> e Jerr</b>y Brown who are incredibly intelligent and have gained so much insight through experience aren't being given a chance because of the<b> ir a</b>ge. He's also pointing out that the millennial generation (which I admit I am a part, I am sorry to say) is incredibly shallow. And it's true. We idolize people like Beyonc\u00e9 and Miley Cyrus because they throw their ass out there, not to mention that every damn generic rap song is about ass <b> and pu</b>ssy and chicks twerking or \"gettin dirty on the floor.\" Hell, anyone remember that song where for the first minute, it's just a guy going \"ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass?\" His point is that we idolize the young because they're young and physical and we discard older people who could potentially save this country because we view the<b> m as</b> old and practically knocking on death's door.

It's just fun to listen to. However, this generation more than ever has seen the rise of Pop stars who don't play instruments, don't write their own music and really have <b> nothing </b>to say or sell other than fame. Look at Rebecca<b>  Black</b>, look at Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus. Their music is so vapid and pointless and just BAD. Even most rap is like that, and the reason why artists like Eminem are so sacred is because they actually do have something to say and that's why they get so much love and attention. I love Eminem precisely because he communicates a point in his music. But Miley Cyrus, her entire point is \"look at me, i'm twerking, I have street cred.\"",

Here are the facts\n\nCalifornia's debt crisis\n\n\n\nThursday, January 9th, 2014\nIssue 02, Volume 18.\n\n\n\nDebt at the national, state and local levels has mushroomed in recent decades. Three California cities have sought bankruptcy protection and there are constant rumors that more may soon follow.\t\t\nAmong the problems impacting California cities are the huge debt obligations owed to CalPERS, the state's public employees' retirement system. For example, Stockton, one of the bankrupt cities, is paying CalPERS roughly $29 million a year, in addition to payments being made to other creditors.\t\t\nDespite passage of a so-called \"balanced\" budget last June, a report by the California Taxpayers Association placed state and local debt at an astounding $443 billion, which amounts to $11,600 for every man, <b> woman </b>and child in the state.\t\t\nMac Taylor, the legislature's budget analyst, recently reported that California's structural budget deficit has disappeared. While this is good news, the report is based on a shaky economic recovery and temporary taxes. It also ignores California's huge future debt obligations.\t\t\nAs we enter 2014, we should remember that all state programs are based on tax revenues generated by private-sector economic activity. Future state and local spending must be reined in so that the debt burden we have accumulated over the last decades can be addressed along with massive unfunded mandates and liabilities that threaten future prosperity. Only then can we truly begin to celebrate California's return from the brink of fiscal insolvency.\t\t\n\nBy Calif. State Assemblymember Marie Waldron (R-75th District",

The end of world war 2 marked the first time in history where we wouldn't disband our army, this has led to a military industrial complex, it might have been the last war that was justified. Between then and the moon landing we engaged in one of the worst wars in US history (Vietnam war), started a drug war that would never end and would only cause more harm. Followed straight up by Reagan who shifted economics in such a bad way by removing regulations, that we would see two recessions from it. Everyone is paying for the past generations mistakes.",

The reason? We have access to infinite knowledge, but we don't have any experience. It makes us think we know what we're talking about, but we don't know anything. We end up being pompous, snooty, know-it-all punk kids.\u00a0\n\nThe worst part? So many of us are socialists when we don't understand economics.\n\nAlso, there was someone in this chain that said that we will be the ones to make solar power, electric cars, etc. Bullshit. These things are already being done by generation X, and people like Elon Musk. The Millenials have literally done<b>  NOTHING</b> AT ALL.",

Technically that was late 1800s. Tesla has a big handle on that, this the name of one electric car brand. 3D printing was invented by a guy born in 1939, and the list goes on. Most of today's creations come from the boomers and Gen X, and most of those are largely based on tech from folks during WWII. Now, do I want to sit there and claim millennials haven't created anything? No, because that would be false. They have the heaviest hand in social media and the gadgets linked to them;  however, they cannot claim most of the tech you've mentioned simply because it was created in their era, nor can my generation,  Generation X, short of more recent tech.",

It's now 2.7 percentage points lower than it was in January 2009, when the president first took office in the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.\n\nHistorically, the jobless rate is now better than it has been most of the time since 1948. The historical median is 5.6 percent.\n\nLong-term Unemployment \u2014 The number went down to just over 2.5 million in June, which is 578,000 fewer than when the president first took office.\n\nJob Openings \u2014 The number of job openings increased further to 5,363,000 as of the last business day in May. That's the highest number of openings since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking them in December 2000. The number of openings has gone up 94 percent since the month the president entered office.\n\nBusiness Start-ups \u2014 New business establishments are opening at an accelerating pace. The Bureau of Labor Statistics counted 224,000 'births' of new establishments in the three months ending last September, the most recent period on record. That's an increase of just under 20 percent compared with the quarter prior to Obama's first inauguration.\n\nThe number of business establishments shutting down permanently \u2014 business 'deaths' \u2014 has gone down by just over 20 percent.",

The difference is someone who has an actual<b>  fat</b> ass it will look like cottage cheese, if someone has a nice ass it's toned and in shape and usually the person is physically fit or has good genetics. It makes more sense that were attracted to phsycially fit women because that's a sign that they would have good genetics to pass on to our offspring and could forage for food/ be a good mother.",

And that doesn't serve its purpose in a modern civilized society, as no one is dying of hunger in America.\n\nI didn't call young people stupid. I just said they were more instinct-driven and impetuous, which they are. The current ass-worshipping trend is more typical of the high-testosterone younger mind that is dominating culture than the older one. But as I said, I don't care much because I don't see those memes as a threat to civilization (yet), as long as the sensitive areas are being controlled by more pragmatic and wise people (who could very well be young, for that matter).",

Well seeing as our genetic imperative is produce offspring likely to survive and a body with store<b> d fa</b>t is more likely to survive in a time period when food was not a given. It is pretty easy to see why such features would be selected for.\n\nWhy do asses indicate youth and fertility? Well I said they suggest that.

But how do you explain the venus figurines from 28,000\u201322,000 years ago, and the statues and paintings of <b> woman </b>through the history that certainly don't have the 3:4 waist-to-hip ratio, but are actually more<b>  chubby</b>? For answers to my own question, see below.\n\nMaybe the waist-to-hip ratio is more important for th<b> e sexua</b>l attractiveness, and t<b> he chub</b<b> >by wo</b>man depicted in art are more of a fertility symbol than attractiveness symbols. But there is also an indicator that the optimal waist-to-hip ratio changes through the time. It could be that people 10,000 years ego find <b> more ch</b<b> >ubby </b>woman more attractive than today.\n\n\"We suggest three possible roles for Venus figurines. Firstly, a minority of images may have been intended to represent young, sexually attractive and nulliparous adult females. These might truly be considered as 'Venuses' in the conventional sense. Secondly, a subset of figurines represented changes in body shape during pregnancy and might be symbols of fertility. Thirdly, the figurines, depicting corpulent and often middle-aged women, may not have been 'Venuses' in any modern or conventional sense. They may, instead, have symbolized the hope for survival and for the attainment of a well-nourished (and thus reproductively successful) maturity, during the harshest period of the major glaciation in Europe.\"\n [LINK] \n\n\"In this study, we demonstrated that the WHR of women considered as symbols of beauty did not vary during the antiquity period (500 BCE\u2014400 CE) and decreased since (at least) the 15th century in western societies. A closer analysis of Playboy models and Miss pageant winners' measurements from 1920 to 2014 revealed a reduction, or even a reversion, of this WHR decrease. The universality of one preferred WHR is thus challenged, and the evolution of men's preferences could be linked to demographic, economic, health or social changes in western societies, which are older than the mass media growth of the 20th century.\"  [LINK] ",

            "commentText": "If we had a parliamentary system I would agree. The problem with electing 78yr olds is not that they are too <b> old </b>to govern. They may very well stay sharp for another couple of decades. The problem is that at that<b>  age</b> (78-86, th<b> e ag</b<b> >e Jer</b>ry Brown would be during a two term presidency) a significantly high percentage of people start to decline mentally. In our presidential system it is very difficult to force our chief executive out. Many believe that Ronald Reagan had already begun to show symptoms of Alzheimer's by the time he left office. If he had, luckily it didn't cause any disasters, but what if he had started to decline a couple of years earlier? What if his decline had been more rapid? What mechanisms do we have to determine that the President is unable to execute his office? Maybe if Congress passed some laws governing these things more clearly it might be an entirely different issue. It is not so m<b> uch age</b>ism as fear of potential senile dementia. If anyone could weigh in with some statistics regarding the actual percentage of people developing Alzheimer's during <b> this</b> age period it would be great. Also, it would be interesting to know how many former Presidents have been afflicted with these types of conditions, how load they were at onset, and how long they had been out of office at the time. If it turns out that very few Presidents ever develop Alzheimer's or that they are diagnosed at a statistically h<b> ighe</b>r age than the general population, I would be less concerned.",

All these people trying to force laws on peoples lives (abortion, <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>marriage, etc.) because they are worried about their children. So ridiculous. Maybe they should go back to raising their kids and actually being parents. Being a parent isnt filling your childs head with your ideas. It is filling it with knowledge and truth, and the wisdom to use it appropriately. How the hell do parents expect their kids to make the right choices in life if they continue to lie to them abou<b> t se</b>x and drugs and politics. Lying to your kids about how the world is doesn't protect them, it sets them to be a pawn in the game of life.

You seem to be confusing feminine for \"sensitive,\" which is rarely the case. As most people can likely attest to, a man can be just as sensitive as a <b> woman,</b> and a<b>  woman</b> can be just as uncaring or insensitive as a man<b> . Gende</b>r roles are largely illusory categorizations which over-generalize trends but ignore the marginal cases that define the complexity of the matter.\nBut anyway, feminism is a kind of misnomer for equality.\nIt means rever<b> se gend</b>er discrimination. So a true feminist wouldn't be any more sensitive than anyone else, unless they saw true discrimination at work. True discrimination doesn't mean, \"let's treat <b> the wo</b>man and the man the same in deciding who gets the job, despite their differences in qualifications.\" Discrimination has to be unfair differentiation. So, if their qualifications were identical, and the employer said, \"I went with the man because he is a man,\" that's discrimination. Similarly, if a bus driver is hiring his replacement, a<b> nd a b</b>lind man applies for the job but the employer says, \"I'm not going to hire you because y<b> ou're </b>blind,\" that's not discrimination, wherea<b> s if a</b> black man applies and the employer says, \"I'm not going to hire you because<b>  you'r</b>e black,\" that is.

There are a lot of variables to this conversation and people commenting can only see 1 dimensionally, should he die in office we'll cross that bridge together. What if he serves 1 term? Until then let's just see what kind of President he turns out to be and how long he'll last (see my prediction). Remember FDR was one of our greatest President who was elected and re-elected\u00a0 a total of 4 terms, who got better at his job as he aged. What's more he had health issues just like JFK.

I don't think people are ever really scared off of a Presidential candidate by the VP running mate, with the possible exception of Sarah Palin in 2008. McCain was over 70 at that point, and had already had a cancer scare - not to mention his years as a POW, which certainly added a physical stress that most of us don't have the misfortune to experience. Now he looks like he's going to make it to January 2017, but back in 2008, his<b>  age</b> and physical history did make that a more relevant question than it normally is. And he was backed up by somebody who was stumped by the question, \"What do you read?\" I<b> f Jerr</b>y Brown ran, chances are that his running mate would be somebody who is both competent and young enough that people expect he or she will still be healthy and strong after two terms.

Not because she is a moron; they didn't know that from the start, but because many thought: 'when (not if) McCain dies, we will be left with a president with little to no experience.'\n\nSo in my opinion, this is the point: candidates who are 75 or older can run, and Bernie Sanders definitely should run, but only with an experienced middle-aged running mate.",
