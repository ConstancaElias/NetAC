        "postText": "'Seven politicians, including five party leaders, joined the ITV debate on Sunday evening. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage left some members of the audience laughing, with others breaking into applause as he clashed with the SNP leader. Responding to the Scottish First Minister, Mr Farage said: Brexit is going to be a great thing for the country Nicola, it is going to give us independence, I thought you liked independence?', 'We are going to be a free nation, catch our own fish.', 'Some members of the audience started laughing as the SNP leader snapped back at Mr Farage.', 'She said: If Scotland was independent, we wouldn\u2019t be getting dragged out of the European Union against our will.', 'Mr Farage quickly replied: You want to be independent? You can\u2019t be independent and be in the EU.', 'The remark sparked applause from some members of the ITV audience.',  'As he turned on Labour 's Richard Burgon, Mr Farage added: Isn\u2019t the real key here - Labour\u2019s referendum would give us a choice, would it not of Remain, versus Remain?', ' The Scottish First Minister was quizzing Conservative representative for the evening, Rishi Sunak, over whether the UK could still leave the EU with no deal. ', ' The ITV debate was hosted by Julie Etchingham as politicians answered questions from a selected studio audience before debating. ', 'Richard Burgon represented the Labour Party, with Jeremy Corbyn also absent along with the Prime Minister.', ' Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrats leader, Nicola Sturgeon the Scottish National Party leader, Nigel Farage the Brexit Party leader, Sian Berry the Green Party co - leader and Adam Price the Plaid Cymru leader all joined the debate.', 'Richard Burgon explained Labour's plan for Brexit if they are elected in the critical December 12 general election. ', 'Leader Jeremy Corbyn has faced criticism for sitting on the fence over Brexit - and has said he will stay 'neutral' over Brexit.', 'If Labour is elected, they have said they will renegotiate a new deal with the European Union before putting it back to the British people in another referendum within six months.', 'The Liberal Democrats have vowed to revoke Brexit, while the SNP have vowed to give Brits another say.', 'Boris Johnson has repeatedly said if he wins a majority in the election - he will push his already agreed deal through the House of Commons.', 'Mr Farage has been critical of the Withdrawal Agreement, and urged the Prime Minister to seek a Free Trade Agreement with the bloc.'",

Burgon challenged this, saying in a fiery exchange: \"You're on the record as saying that you saw the case for replacing our National Health Service with some kind of American-style insurance system. \"Interrupting, Farage said: \"I've never said anything of the kind, I've said that richer people [should have] private insurance. \"Footage from 2012 shows otherwise, however. In a notorious video from his \"<b> Common </b>Sense\" speaking tour, Farage is seen called for an insurance-based system of healthcare dictated by market forces rather than central government. The video has been re-shared by numerous campaigners including anti-Brexit group Led by Donkeys and NHS Million. Hahahaha, if you mean sense is a darn right lie, and I forgot what I said ages ago? Yeah, I sense what you mean about Mr Farage \"Talking Sense\".",

Whether we like it or not some kind of insurance based system may be the only way to preserve anything resembling the NHS. The Parties who have suggested that pouring more and more and more money into the bottomless pit are the same Parties who are in favour of what amounts to open borders immigration. Supporting the NHS and arguing for an open borders policy are 2 policies that are completely at odds with each other.",

We are no less independent than any of the other 27 sovereign members. If fact we\u2019re along with France the most independent as the only two countries possessing our own \u201c Independent deterrent\u201d? Reject Mr Farage nonsense, it\u2019s prehistoric delusional thinking. His brexit leads only to conflict over something we already enjoy. We cannot fight climate change on our own for ours &amp; families future. We have to act together now! The best way to to do that\u2019s is not Farage\u2019s way, just to your own thing go your own way. Climate change doesn\u2019t give a stuff about our borders. With 27 other nations, though, we can take a stand together. Vote against Farage\u2019s brexit, too Exit from brexit. It\u2019s the real enemy to our UK.",

And they do buy a lot of the British catch. Many EU companies actually own UK water fishing quotas and have ownership of UK based boats and fish processors in the UK . Espc. Spain and France Still, the EU Just might be crazy enough.But lets 's consider that UK boats can now catch 25 % or more each boat as they'll have many more days at sea than EU regs.allow, then they 'll be able to accept a lower price per individual fish, but selling enough greater volume and getting more revenue in total , offsetting the tarriffs .",

Keep the fishing fleet and declare the fishing waters Scotland's.....WRONG!  Keep fishing in UK waters when you are a member of the EU will not be allowed.  Get real woman, the EU will see that you have nothing left that interests them, except that they will be able to dump unskilled workers from God knows where on to Scotland whether they like it or not.... immigrants can be paid a pittance whereas Scots would demand a living wage, but the thing is that there will be no work because any self respecting business will have relocated to the other side of the border by then.

We are all British citizens living on the same Island, our armed forces having fought and died together through two world wars to keep our United Kingdom free and sovereign. The SNP is the very antithesis of that, a Marxist group of subversives whose agenda is to divide us and split that close union, hence all the whinging about England. Truth be told, there are probably more English living in the north of Scotland than Scots and they love it up here. So let's understand what all this anti-English rhetoric from the SNP is truly about, it's about divide and conquer and it does not reflect the mind or will of the Scottish people.",

She and her party are largely disliked in Scotland and this raises questions for me about she keeps getting re-elected. Between postal votes and the extending of votes to kids and immigrants, the SNP are twisting the system to stay in power.",

Also the leave vote here was over 72%. So it looks like Liebore have sounded their own death knell by being a remain party and a duffer leader and a unimpressive bunch of miscreants on their front benches!",

A democratic grassroots vote was given to the people, and all that has happened is the politicians have spent a wasted three years arguing and undermining the result and it looks interminable. The political elite have lost control and are doing anything and everything to try to restore it. They had things all nicely set up, then some damned fool allowed the people their vote.There was never supposed to be that much \"democracy\" allowed....See more",

There was no reaction of hystical amusement: what immediately followed Farage 's words was stony silence. Farage is like a mad uncle telling an impressionable 14 year - old: \"When you grow up you can turn your back on your family and friends and live an entirely independent and selfish life, and everyone will do what you want!\" Life doesn't work like that, either for individuals or for nations. It is all a matter of accepting family ties and responsibilites, and to some extent choosing your friends, but then acknowledging the two-way traffic of rights and responsibilites. If we are not going to be a leader in Europe, we are going to have to be a follower to the USA. It is as simple as that. And Farage wants us to be a follower to the Yanks so that he personally can add massively to his already enormous personal fortune. The stony silence indicates that the confidence trickster is at last being found out.",
