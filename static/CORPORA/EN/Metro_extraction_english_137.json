        "postText": "Calls are growing for Baroness Doreen Lawrence to apologise after claiming that firefighters would have tried harder to save the victims of the Grenfell tragedy, if they were white.', 'Baroness Lawrence, whose 18-year-old son Stephen was murdered by a racist gang in south-east London in 1993, said she had \u2018no doubt\u2019 that racism was involved in the response to the Grenfell tragedy.', 'She told Channel 4 in an interview last week: \u2018Had that been a block full of white people in there, they would have done everything to get them out as fast as possible and make sure that they do what they needed to do.', '\u2018Nobody wanted to mention the word \u201crace\u201d in the whole thing. Cos when I saw the residents who lived in that block, to me it was under no doubt around the racism that existed at that time.\u2019', 'A subsequent petition demanding she apologise has so far collected almost 35,000 signatures.', 'It claims Baroness Lawrence\u2019s remarks were defamatory towards the \u2018brave men and women of London fire brigade\u2019.', 'It adds: \u2018At great risk to themselves, they saved many lives which would have been lost without their intervention.\u2019', 'The petition even claims that Baroness Lawrence should have her \u2018honour removed\u2019 and she should be \u2018barred from public office\u2019.', 'A London Fire Brigade spokesperson said: \u2018We absolutely refute the claims made by Baroness Doreen Lawrence that there was any aspect of racism in our response to the Grenfell Tower fire or any other incident.', '\u2018Every single one of the firefighters and officers who responded to the fire that night were fully committed to rescuing as many people as possible and put their own lives at risk to do so.\u2019', 'Baroness Lawrence has been approached for comment.",
