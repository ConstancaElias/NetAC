        "postText": "Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn joined Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield on This Morning earlier today to discuss the London Bridge attacks, anti-semitic claims and if he is waiting to put his Christmas Tree up until after the General Election.',' 'During the conversation, Willoughby was keen to find out why Corbyn had such trouble saying 'sorry' in regards to the anti-semitic claims his party is currently facing.', 'So much so, she sort of forced a half-hearted apology out of him.', 'Willoughby started the conversation about the anti-semitism claims head-on saying:We should discuss anti-semitism within your party.', 'You have come out and sort of apologised on this, it seems that this [sorry] has been the hardest word for your to say.', 'Corbyn quickly responded: Well it's not at all. When I became leader of the party there were no processes to deal with anti-semitism.', 'He continued: I instituted those.I also made sure that in argregious cases there was a rapid system of doing it and I proposed that to our national executive in July.', ' Corbyn went on to say he instituted a process of education in the party, until he was interrupted by Willoug Willoughby said: Then why are so many people upset then ? Can you understand that ? ', 'Corbyn continued: Listen.I want everyone in this country to feel secure.', 'There is no place whatsoever for anti - semitism within our society. ', 'Corbyn went on: Listen a Rabbi was attacked on the streets of north London the other evening - utterly disgusting. ', 'I\u2019 ve spoken to other Rabbis about this over the last few days and they say it was a horrible, horrific event. ', 'Schofield interrupted and said: A chief Rabbi, has said Jews are justifiably anxious about the idea of Jeremy Corbyn becoming Prime Minister, a poison sanction from the top has taken root in Labour - 130 cases of anti - semitism are still outstanding against Labour members. ', ' So here is your opportunity now, to apologise to the Jewish community for any anti - semitism by Labour members. ', 'Corbyn asked if he can explain something and was immediately cut off by Schofield. ', 'Corbyn said: Our party has - but Schofield was quick to interrupt: No just say sorry. ', ' Schofield pushed: I want you to say sorry. ', 'Corbyn finally said: Our party and me...do not accept - but Schofield continued: Are you sorry for everything that 's happened', 'Obviously I\u2019m very sorry for anything that has happened but I want to be clear I am dealing with it, Corbyn replied.', 'He continued: We just do not accept it in any form whatsoever and I think the Chief Rabbi\u2019 s comments really ought to be - I am very happy to meet him very happy to talk to him and happy to talk to anybody from the Jewish community but any other form of racism is unacceptable. ', 'After his apology the hosts went on to talk about the upcoming General Election. ', 'Willoughby asked: Don\u2019 t you just want to put your feet up and go, is it all worth it ? ', 'Corbyn responded : No not a bit of it - you go out and you do what you believe in .', 'This Morning continues weekdays at 10.30 am on ITV.'",
