But if you aren't religious and you wanna get married you're allowed to do it however you want! Some husband's even take the wife's last name. Not every construct is an oppressive. Not every word is <b> racist </b>or sexist or hateful you just choose to preceive it that way because you're selfconcious or scared of the truth.",

No, no matter how wonderful my husband is, and he is, I prefer all of my rights and safety intact as much as possible. No, I was not given away by anyone. I'm not an object. Yes, my husband and I did have a fantastic wedding, our version of one. Did my husband or I change our names? Why would we? It's a complicated mess of paperwork.

But why is it so hard to view a ritual so transformed that it can actually become part of this quest for equality. Marriage these days does not necessarily include any of the things you mention. Also, consider the reasons for including these parts of the ritual. What if your wedding dress is like comepletely see through and short, and white just because you happen to love that color and design? What if no one hands you over? What if 10 dollars are spent in the whole ceremony? what if you actually don't wven sign a paper and just have your friends and family come over to celebrate the fact that you are in a happy and healthy relationship.",

However, today we can choose how we want our wedding and choose if we want our husbands last name. Personally I will walk the aisle alone and not change my name. And I think that if a women wants the last name pf her husband she should not be shamed about it. Because it's her choice. And feminism is about women being equal to men and making their own decisions",

Without a Prenup, partners can be eligible for 50% of your assets. \nIt also depends on who's name is on the papers (who owns the house), and who pays the bills (if a car is in your husbands name, but you pay the bills, you do have rights) etc. Courts will take this in to consideration first. Don't be a dummy. Get a Prenuptial agreement, and marriage can be beautiful and fair.",

I've been with my boyfriend for 5 years and never plan to marry - why should a piece of paper dictate if we're together  officially?  Or enforce it? In America marriage is meh anyway. Most of this  video is educational but seems to be for other countries where there  are tons of <b> crazy </b>human rights problems. \n\nMarriage is a tool for money and to make relatives happy. If it makes sense someday financially I could see it, but to marry for no other reason than to get paperwork saying we're a couple doesn't make sense.",

            "commentText": "I think I must be missing the point feminists are trying to make when they say its oppression to take the man's surname when they marry. When they say giving up their name do they not mean giving up their fathers name? A surname is simply a practical way to identify a family group, a surcoat is a coat that covers  all the under garments, a surname is a name that covers all the names of the family to put them under a group heading.  What is the feminist alternative, Jane Smith marry's Jack Jones, thinks she is oppressed if she drops her fathers name so becomes Jane smith Jones. That seems fine but then she has a daughter Jenny Smith Jones who marries a man who also had a feminist <b> nutter </b>for a mother and he his called John Brown Johnston. Better hope little jenny isn't a feminist<b>  nutter</b> like her mum or she is going to have to change her name to Jenny Smith Jones brown Johnston. Does anyone else see the problem here?\nI think you'll find surnames were not invented to oppress women but as a simple practical solution to identify who little Tommy's mum and dad are.\n\n\nAlso when a father gives his daughter away it isn't him giving his property away, it symbolizes him passing on the responsibility of the protection of that which he holds most dear to another. It isn't him selling his property as you so kindly put it, it's him saying \"this is that which I hold most precious, you had better lover her and protect like i do or i will descend on you like the wrath of of god\"\nIt's an act of love not an act of oppression.\n\n\nLuckily for you though it is unlikely that you will get married so changing your name or being given away will not be an issue. That's not a remark based on your looks by the way it's based on the fact your personality comes across as rather vile.\n\n\nFor the rest of us though most women cherish their fathers walking them down the isle and for most fathers it will continue to be the proudest day of their lives.\n\n\nOh and by the way wedding dresses are not white to represent virginity you clown, blue is the traditional colour that represents purity. White didn't become popular until Queen Victoria wore it and the widely published images made it popular........ I think they call this fashion. If you're going to manipulate history to portray a fictitious view centered around female oppression at least get your facts right. If you are going to be <b> a nutte</b>r don't make yourself look like a stupid one, that's what I say.",

You were pretty, once - once before you were misled; before you wasted your life with the radical feminists who led you astray, spoiling the sweet nectar of your youth like a summer harvest left to rot in the sun. You could have had kids. A family. Loved. Been loved. What's left? Just a few gnarly <b> old </b>shapeless lesbians mowing the lawn and stitching their dungarees. Was this really what you wanted before you got in too deep? The worst thing is: you're a political lezzer, Jules! It means you've spent the last 40 years denying yourself the things only a man can give you. Women's bodies do not move you! I know you like the way we look; the way we walk. Fer feck's sake: you even love Snoop Dogg! Your unbreakable infatuation with that brilliant-but-hoe-slapping MC seems bizarre until we realise you're really one of us deep down. Snoop brazenly tells women to \"eat a d*ck\" and you chant furiously along with him. Interesting, that!  I guess on many levels, you admire that, his forcefulness, his marvellous emceeing washed in adrenaline and testosterone your friends with the funny haircuts can never hope to match. His words lodge in your mouth like a symbolic phallus, and yet, you are unrepentantly infatuated with this glaring contradiction on a deeply Freudian level for a reason. Oh, Julie. Come back! Come back to us. it's not too late.",

Marriage was seen as a partnership between two family; marrying to someone you love didnt become a norm until the late 1800s. Women didnt have many rights and were consider property. They were seen as property, pass to the husband, which the husband paid a dowry annually to the bride's parent. This is reason why the women last name was change because she belong to her husband family.",

            "commentText": "This is a very intellectually flabby video.\nFirst the assertion that the institution of marriage is a tool of patriarchal oppression. It is not good enough to make this as a blanket statement. It may be a fair point in the forty seven countries stated that the legal rights of women are diminished or negated in marriage. The hudood laws in Pakistan are particularly egregious. Making this statement however in relation to all marriage regardless of <b> nation </b>or legality is nonsensical. Marriage in western nations has rendered men little more than chattels who may be discarded and disposessed on the whim of wives and in nations such as the U.K with the financial and legal backing of the state though mercifully state legal aid for divorce has reduced the gold rush of the dregs of womanhood from this mendacious money making scheme. \nSecondly to state that a<b>  woman</b> being given away by her father is a matter of oppression is also erroneous in Western societies since the legal status of this act has become purely ceremonial like trooping the colour or church rush bearing. The legal status of women has been elevated to beyond parity which renders laughable the argument of Ms. Bindel.\n\n\nThe likes of Ms. Bindel attack men in Western societies simply because we are sufficiently reasonable and tractable on average for this to have an advantageous result in many instances as evidenced by the rights and freedoms enjoyed by women and taken for granted. It is however notable that those who week to campaign for social justice (a term which has become horrible corrupted since we should surely all want to live in a just society) dare not speak about the flagrnat injustices carried out in som<b> e ethni</b>c or social groupings for fear of appearing prejudiced. This is a rather difficult dilemma to overcome so white anglo saxon men continue to take a pasting on behalf of the sexist elements of global manhood. How is that social justice?",

Neither does having your husband's name imply that he owns you. Let me also say that no one is forcing the <b> woman </b>to have her father give her away, or to take her husband's name. These are choices that she made. And, even if these things were anti feminist (which they aren't), I think it's a bit ignorant to say that marriage can never be feminist. What if, say, the<b>  woman</b> kept her maiden name and was given away by her mother, or no one at all? Would that marriage still be anti feminist?

First off, women choose to get married and in America it's pretty much illegal to have forced marriages. Second the whole father giving the bride away is just another way families signify the two families coming together and some families have the mothers give the brides away. Third your point on the last name change doesn't really make sense because, that tradition is just another way brides can get welcomed into the family. Besides, wouldn't you think it's kind of strange starting a family with two separate last names? What if you have kids? Do they get half of their moms last name and half of their dads? Wouldn't that make it more confusing when/if they get married? So your points don't really make sense when you think about it do they?",

That is why families used to marry off their kids. Which Feminists like to pretend like it was just the girls. But men don't really invest in children they don't know are theirs without social conditioning. And it STILL isn't effective. So a woman's guarantee of  prevision and protection traded for a man's guarantee that he could pass on his genes.  Love was limited to peasants with no linage because a butcher and a baker had status. But farm hands and manual labor workers did not. Which is why women will date up socially.

But that is past and you cannot blame those people in the future of past mistakes. You could however create a better future by experience of the past. (Pretty basic). Although thanks to feminists movement people realized that there is something wrong about the norms of society that should be changed. But shrugging of marriage is being irresponsible. Marriage is Family, Family is being Human. Though could not be said \"nature of human\", it is system or yea institution that both <b> gender </b>raise  children doesn't matter who's the provider or the one's taking care of their family at home or both provides rather than where you sow future generation. Sacrifice of both person for the sake of their children. If you do not take commitments, how will you teach your child to be responsible? Although people are being<b>  blind</b> about situation divorce takes a big toll on their children. If I were a girl and being married to a person can condemn me as feminist. It is better, than to let my children see how irresponsible I am as a female. Same goes to male.",

We're in a day and<b>  age</b> where it's okay to not have children or even relationships. I think the main take away is acting like if <b> a woma</b>n willingly chooses the traditional life of the husband providing for her while she cares for the home and/or kids, that she shouldn't complain if that is the life she chose in the sense of acting like he's oppressing her when she chose to be a stay at home parent. It's one thing if the guy forced her to do it which is wrong and shows they were never compatible to begin with.  \n\n\nBut I mean take yourself for example. If you're wanting to work in a field that you're passionate about and don't want to be a stay at home parent, that's fine but if you were to have kids, would you be okay with your husband being a stay at home parent? Would you be okay if in the situation where both parents decide to keep working, you'd just hire a full-time caretaker for the kids and in turn, giving the kids less time to see each parent since both would be working full-time jobs (if you have any kids that is)? \n\n\n\nIt's more about things like that though if you don't plan on having kids, this isn't even an issue in the first place.",

First off most of these women who goes by it are either insecure, lowly educated or have tons of daddy issues.

I agree that in some shitty places and people and situations, there are horrible marriages that rely on oppression, stunted education, ridiculous and rigid <b> gender </b>roles etc. \nI just think it's silly to point at a very<b>  common</b> practice and declare that it is one thing for everybody. For some people, marriage is freeing and not oppressive. And as a younger married person, I am just pointing out that most acquaintances I have in the ages of 30-40 are always asking to be set up, complaining about how they're not meeting someone special, and being sad about not having kids or a home life or a partner. A lot of the time, these acquaintances were women in their 20s being heavily sold the \"empowerment\" narrative that says \"you don't need a man in your life!\" \nOk fine, but as life stretches on, and good looks gradually fade, it seems to me that having at least one partner who's got your back at the end of the day is positive for most people. If you're a lone wolf, fine, but I'm just making a comment on most people I have met and known and generalizing. Plenty of marriages shouldn't have happened, but that does not negate the fact that in general, humans are happier with a person who loves them back. Maybe it's an absolutely insane idea and everyone would be happier going to bed alone after rush-eating take out food.",

Yeah it definitely isn't your fault for something that happened 80years ago , but to continue on the traditions today and be neutral in such situations , one have actually chosen the side of the oppressor .\n\nI don't think it is quite right to determine  as to what jobs we would be happier and better at doing based on genders, life isn't all<b>  black</b> and white. Some men are good at sewing and cooking, some women are good at hands on labor and would love to be in combat, other men love the color pink, some women love the color blue . \n\nThere's also <b> a commo</b>n belief that women are bad at math, but is it true? From what I know the valedictorian of my cohort is a female.. It is such prejudice beliefs that stunt the growth and beliefs in many humans, potentials that they could otherwise have. When half the population is held back, is it benefiting society as a whole? \nIf society told a child she is weak and a damsel in distress her whole life, would it be of any surprise that she grows up in that direction? I hope you get the gist of it..",

Men don't care about last names or women working and being managers, we don't care what you choose to do with your lives. Just stop with double standards and if women truly are as tough as you claim to be stop playing the victim when things go wrong. \n\nIf a man touches a women it's harassment, if a women touches a man it's just fun. If a man suffers from abuse he needs to toughen up, if it's a women suffering well the man needs locking up.\n\nFeminists claim women are tough but stop anyone from joking about them as it could hurt their feelings\ud83e\udd14 seems odd. In the case of this Video it demonises marriage saying women are men's property, in the past maybe so but in today's world it's to show that two people actually love each other. \n\nTo me saying to women not to get married is just putting another barrier between women and men. Instead of constantly putting men down (remember we had <b> nothing </b>to do with the past so how can we help it) why don't we work together to make a better future. Let's start with men and women getting married having kids and raising them to not be untitled brats. \n\ndrops mic \n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

Who wouldn't with a partner like that.\n\nPut yourself in the position of the <b> woman </b>how would you feel if a person who claims to love you were to \"drag you around by the hair?\" I'm sure you would kick up a huge storm as well. Unto to others as to unto to you. \nAnd remember the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world, i presume prehistoric women were sure to have warned their daughters of the road that may lie ahead. We do not want history repeating itself. That is the reason why feminism is on the rise. Every time a<b>  woman</b> gets mistreated at the hands of a man, feminism will just increase in popularity. \n\nLet's learn to be respectful to one another simply because we are all human beings with feelings . \nAnd no, I do not agree that anyone be it male or female should be abused or harassed in anyway, it's not funny.",

It's well documented men were beaten if the mistreated their wife, men were also beaten if they let there wife beat them. Hmm women seemed to have it real bad. Women were queens ruled kingdoms even led army's in the past I don't see that as not equal.\nIf you truly think women are unequal google leader of the uk,leader of Scotland, leader of Ireland and then look at head of royal family they are all most powerful positions in the uk and all are women. Next look at who gets into uni more often again it's women. Let's see now maybe let's throw in who is more likely to get picked for a job if you have the same education.. again it's women. \n\nI will be honest with you I couldn't care less who does what but making a video putting down women who want to get married is wrong, didn't proper feminists fight for a women to choose what she does not let a small minority (who can't find a man) dictate to her. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \nI've enjoyed speaking to you though it's made my week",

Lol! \n\nThe original topic is that every <b> woman </b>can get a man. You know this , everyone knows this it's basics of life that we figure out at a young<b>  age</b>. Men desire women intensely. They want to be inside of us, around us, amongst us just to feel good. The lowest o<b> f woma</b>n what would be considered a mere 'one' will still have more power than a man would ever know. The richest man on earth still does not have that power women possess. This is exactly what you mgtows hate us for. You know we are desired by all whereas most men are not desired, or needed.",

If you pay attention to statistics, you will notice that females overwhelmingly vote in favor of things like open borders and welfare, while simultaneously supporting a never ending parade of progressive social behaviors.  In Europe, it is primarily women who have welcomed Islam in.\n\nIn America most women vote Democrat, while most men vote Republican.  Obviously both parties have their flaws, but it is only the Democrats that are actively calling for the abolition of border security and the revision of the Constitution.  So I think it is fair to say that a majority of women are responsible for undermining the civilizations that they live in.\n\nThe liberal world order (democracy, globalism, and unalienable human rights) is slowly dying, and will most likely be replaced by the end of this century.  When that happens, women (and the limp-wristed men who enable them) are going to be in for a rude awakening as they are stripped of their agency in favor of the greater good.\n\nI see this all as an inevitability, more than anything.  Ancient Rome and Mesopotamia both practiced variations of feminism near the end of their reigns.  When the empires collapsed (as empires always do), hardline <b> patriarchy </b>returned.",

Even now it is incredibly unpopular with anyone under the <b> age </b>of 40.  Eventually cohabitation and long-term relationships of any sort will disappear,  as the last traces of goodwill between men and women vanish.\n\nThe modern world is self-oriented.  Women woke up to this fact first, but men are slowly coming around to it as well.  My father told me how he had always dreamed of having a family, and how putting the women in one's life first was a man's greatest responsibility.  I understand how he came to hold those beliefs, but I personally reject them.  Family life is the death of male sovereignty, and women no longer behave in a way deserving of special treatment.  I treat women the same as I treat men, and I treat most men as competition.\n\nFeminism has opened the eyes of countless men, and for that I am grateful.  If tomorrow every<b>  woman</b> in America decided to denounce feminism and become a good little trad-wife, I wouldn't care.  I have seen beyond the veil and know now that femininity is little more than a mask.  It's time for society to start treating women the same way that it treats men.  Sign up for the draft, start working dirty jobs, and stop complaining becaus<b> e nobod</b>y cares anymore.",

If anything marriage and family would likely be a source of strength since many are willing to do far more for those they care about, but I guess that don't matter to someone like you, someone as weak and childish as yourself.  In the end thats all you contemporary feminists and progressives are the way you act to your interactions with others.  It has all the hallmarks of an undisciplined child.

            "commentText": "You seem to be forgetting the practice of Dowry. Parents still loved their daughters back then and wanted the best for them (if they were good parents). They gave small fortunes away to ensure it. Dowries were practiced on nearly every continent. Now I don't agree with arranged marriages but I can see why the practice came to be. Women were married extremely young. Life expectancy was short. People grew up way faster in past times. If you got to pick your spouse at <b> age </b>12 or 14 do you think you would have made a good choice ? Either way it's a crapshoot. Like I said, I don't agree with it, but if you put yourself in those antique shoes you can see why it happened. \n\nAs far as marriage today. I'd say that my wife and I have a very equitable share of power. It's true that, according to our faith, the man gets the say if absolutely no compromise can be reached. Luckily that almost never happens since we work hard to understand each other and compromise. In fact I'd say she is responsible for 80% of the decisions we make. The quote from My Big<b>  Fat</b> Greek Wedding is dead on - \"The man is the head, but th<b> e woma</b>n is the neck. The neck turns the head\"",

I do agree on the point that marriage is legal prostitution. But men haven't oppressed women; women have been oppressed by there own physical biologies. Men have done<b>  nothing</b> but be endentured servants to women. You are way off base here with your feminist misandric  ideaology.  I do not hate women just the way they use the victim narrative (such as yourself). Men are the ones who are oppressed by women. Simply for female validation. It is disgusting and abhorrent the way you spit in the eyes of men. Who have done (and will continue to do<b> ) nothin</b>g more (since the dawning of time) protect, die, build, and maintain our world. All for the approval of this guynocentric agenda. Think about this video and my comment the next you see men working on roads, vehicles, moving men, welders etc... think abjectively without the hatred you have in your heart for men and understand that it is womens own physical biologies which make you feel that you are oppressed. Take care and i hope you find what your looking for in life FEMITARD!\ud83d\udc4e...Always a thumbs down for stupidity like this.",

The reason the lady had to give up her last name( in the past), is... firstly men don't breast feed babies. So the husband is more likely to work and make the majority of the income. secondly women are naturally submissive in a romantic relationship. If she wasn't she would not be attracted to him. If she truly loved her husband she's much more likely to join his family with there child than give there kid 2 or 3 last names. Think about it how many last names would we all have now if we decided to keep all last names for argument sake.",

If you look at the facts, you will see that religion is what paints a picture of male dominance.  The bible oppresses women in many way, such as selling your own daughter as a <b> sex </b>slave, a virgin who is raped has to may the rapist and women are property.  These are all from the bible and other religions share the belief that men are better.  If you truly want equality, look to the athiests.  As an athiest, I know my girlfriend is equal to me.  I am a welder and love my job but will easily tell anyone that my girlfriend who is learning to weld will most likely end up welding even better that I do.  If we were to get married, it would not be so that I own her.  It would be because we want to be married.  Her taking my last name upon marriage, from her own words, would be because she likes my last name better than her own.  Besides, name is<b>  nothing</b> but a word that we give power to.  The women can divorce the man and take the kids at any point.  The man rarely ever gets the kids.  He then also has to pay child support.  A simple name change i<b> s nothin</b>g compared to only seeing your kids a certain times",

Here, in America, fewer women are \"given away by their fathers\", more women work, in the relationship, outside the household (let's face it, with today's American economy, a single income household struggles to stay afloat, anyway), and more men opt to take the wives name out of the feeling of duty if equality in the marriage. Household chores are becoming more and more equally shared, as well as parenting duties. Women are often (in household that can afford this) permitted, or even treated to day spa outings, or daycations, where they can be treated like queens, getting manicures, pedicures, hair treatments, massages, etc. at the expense of household funds. More domestic abuses repeated are still women reporting then, despite the fact that more men are abused by their women than in domestic history, yet fewer of the women reportedly guilty of abusing their men are jailed, on average. And, even if the husband defends himself against an abusive wife, he's still, more commonly than not, the one who gets arrested. Wives, these days, in an equal marriage, appreciate the father of their child (ren) being more active in the shared parenting. In fact, they encourage it. And, by my own observation, both spouses try to work the same hours so the parenting can be done by both at once. Family outings, family nights are encouraged a lot.",

Men and women are not the same, but rather complimenting partners, who for centuries work together to build families and lives together.

No female should have rights. All of them should be the property of a patriarch until the day they die. He should have the power of attorney over her. They should be permanently banned from voting, political office, owning real estate, businesses, stocks and bonds. Female education and a jobs should be the patriarchs option. The patriarch should literally be the king of his home having undisputed power over wife, daughters or any female in his care. Anyone that enters his property without his express permission or to undermine his authority should sued into poverty or dealt with harshly. His authority and property must be inviolate in all circumstances. Anyone in society that indirectly tries to undermine patriarchal power or portray men in an unfavorable manner should be sued into poverty or dealt with harshly.  Such as the following.  Anyone that attempts to make a movie or tv show with a Homer Simpson type character or that shows a <b> woman </b>in a bare knuckle fight with a man and she wins. A drama where the father is evil, the home is broken and the children insult their father. Anyone that advocates a revival of family courts, child support, alimony or feminism. I think under these conditions marriage would be safe, children would be happy and society prosperous. Just like early Rome.",

But, then again - more often than not - I give in, unless it is something I feel so strongly about. But she knows me so well, and understands my reasoning on the very few times I do 'dig my heals in'. Again it is all about discussion. My respect for her knows no bounds, and she feels the same towards me. I am <b> nothing </b>without her, and she agrees from her side. We are far stronger as a couple than we could ever be as individuals. Together we are a force to be reckoned with. each others strengths compliment each others weaknesses. And we are ALWAYS there for each other, through thick and<b>  thin</b>. AND our bond grows stronger all the time, and with every obstacle in life that we face......TOGETHER!! Actually one more thing: In May my mum passed away from cancer at th<b> e ag</b>e of 75. My father is so out of his depth in life now it's untrue. I actually expect him to 'go' at any time. My mum was the dominant one in their relationship, and he can't handle her being gone. Your opinions on the truth of me, my wife......my parents? I await your response.",

People are angry at her and say stuff like: oh she's so ugly, she says that because she can't get a man.... The point is, you don't have to be a feminist preacher to just think about the fact that historically marriage was a tool of opression for women. Even if things have changed nowdays, the simple fact that so many women take their husbands name is a sign that she ,,belongs\" to him and those little things affect a woman's sense of identity. Very seldom you will see men taking up their wives name and they will more likely feel insulted if you would suggest that to them.",

However, do not go to far on the other side either; I've seen tendencies of it lately. Let women do what they want - if you want to marry at<b>  age</b> 20, do so - but if you want to stay single until 35, or even never get married, do so too (I believe most women want to get married in life but \"most\" is not \"all\").",

You encounter these \"feminist\" problems because of (a) your \"everybody is against me\" attitude, and (b) you are painfully unattractive.

There's not a father in the western cultural hemisphere who'd sell his daughter to her husband to be for a goat and two camels - get real! This video perpetuates third wave feminism as a means of breaking patriarchal chains clapped on by marriage yet I ask you this..\n\nWhy are the majority of humans in the western world still getting married? There's no law forcing chicks to marry blokes yet they DO IT ANYWAY..\n\nAnswer to the title of your video.. People still get married because the majority of women don't identify as feminist. You're only preaching to the converted few here. The very tiny few. Good luck!",

And you see why I say mindset isn't based on <b> gender,</b> because believe me, some men are repulsed by women that feel a need to have more rights than them.

            "commentText": "Well The Guardian, this <b> woman(</b> whilst I acknowledge her contribution to the early feminist movement ) is wrong, for a couple reasons. Now first off, about the bride being given to her husband by the father, this is commonly what many people don't think of when they see this image. The symbol commonly symbolizes moving from one family unit to another, and going from being a daughter, to being a wife, and the patriarchal figure of the household entrusting the safety of their daughter to another person. Now whilst the conservative imagery may seem a bit disconcerting, this imagery has<b>  nothing</b> to do with the modern interpretation of the ceremony. \n\n   Second of all, the \"virgin equals purity\" aspect. This is wrong because ( unless you live in an ultra conservative environment  ) this is commonly not how practice is seen, it commonly ( in the moder<b> n ag</b>e anyways ) is seen as a beautiful dress meant to be the uniform for the bride, and did I mention how not all marriages involve brides in white? \n\n  Third, the  ridiculous assertions that child marriage is the equivalent to consensual adult marriage. This proposition is simply too simple minded to even pay attention to. Shame one you for making this ridiculous assertion. \n\nAnyways, in short, The Guardian, please refrain from making these half baked idea videos, they are really hurting your image. Please consider this comment. \n\nSincerely, someone who has way to much time.",

Most of the time fathers don't give away their daughter like property. I'm sure if these people used their brain and tested out and surveyed married people if that's what occurred then the results would be as I said. An issue I see a lot with feminists and far left people is they always make multiple things out to be clear cut terrible and erase all meanings except for the ones they're against for some reason.",

            "commentText": "Marriage is about love, trust, and mutual consent. That is the modern definition, and the Bible supports this vision as well in the book Song of Solomon (one of my favorite books to read because it is all about love). The Bible also says \"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her\" (Ephesians 5:25, ESV). It is true that there were traditions such as exchanging dowry and remaining a virgin until marriage that put certain interpretations and views upon marriage, but those traditions don't apply in the western world much anymore. When I think of marriage, I think of finding that one man in my life that I love and respect, the man who I can't nor want to live without, and the man who feels the same undying love for me that I feel for him. The reason I'm choosing to stay a virgin until marriage isn't because he would think I'm worthless if I didn't, but rather, a) I want <b> sex </b>to mean something more than 5 seconds of euphoria, and b) we BOTH decided it was the healthiest thing for our relationship, so we could base our compatibility on our emotional, intellectual, and spiritual compatibility. Essentially we are waiting to add the physical aspect that often blinds couples from the flaws in their relationships until after we've bonded more and worked through some of the kinks in our relationship. I also think it's absolutely absurd to think of marriage as enslavement or a prison in today's western society. We have all the freedom in the world (or at least the western world) to choose whether to commit ourselves to a man or leave him. No one is telling you that you have to get married. So why do you have to force this agenda down other women's throats, saying they are just \"brainwashed\" or \"blinded\"? Is it wrong to be in love with a man? Is it wrong to want to commit yourself to the one you love? Is it wrong to want to save yourself for that person, rather than give your body to just any man you think you could get a good bang out of? Marriage is a beautiful, wonderful gift from God and if a<b>  woman</b> expects a man to be committed to her, she needs to be willing to commit to him and give him the same love and respect she desires. God Bless.",

On one hand this is one of best unintentionally funny videos I've seen today, and I've seen watched some good ones. On the other hand, I pity Bindel for how she sees the world: everything is political, and <b> nothing </b>is worthwhile unless it advances her feminist ideology. You know, sometimes two people are just in love. That an 11th century daughter of a noble would have been given in marriage as a political deal has bears little resemblance to a modern wedding. What's the solution - a concentration camp for brides? Why does that seem familiar?",

A wife agrees to submit to her husband and raise the children while managing the expenses and keeping the house, not just the physical, but emotional one as well in order. While the husband makes sure his wife never feel dissatisfied, his children never go hungry and he should be willing to sacrifice his life for their sake, as Christ did for his wife the Church. He should be willing to take time out of his day to do favors for his wife and kids. The husbands life should be one of thankfulness, and gratitude, to the wife's willing self sacrifice and servitude. It is when both genders humble themselves and put away the desires of each one of them and focus on the desires of God and their family, that a happy, loving relationship can bloom. Anything other than this is what's really sexist",

            "commentText": "Some valid points about the horrific ways some other cultures use marriage as a means for oppression and inequality, but it's those examples that need to be considered, not the modern British marriage. I've spoken about marriage with my girlfriend and suggested we keep our own names, but she was adamant that she wanted to take mine - she said that we are a unit together. I understand the fact that she is taking MY name is indicative or perhaps even representative of an older, more unequal form of marriage, but it carries none of the same practical appliance today. You're right, this and also being given away by one's father are archaic, but in a modern context they don't seek to unbalance the relationship as they once did - they simply offer a sense of quaint tradition and an outlet for a specific form of heterosexual love. On the other side of the coin, there are plenty of women who are made uncomfortable by these ideas and choose to avoid them, and that's amazing and admirable. Also, I don't want to be 'that' guy (I broadly regard myself as a feminist) but I think many women (not all) look to men for a level of security and protection perhaps on a biological level, and it's upon this basis that some of these paradigms still remain (I've not done the research there, I'm happy to be debunked.) I think it's wonderful if a <b> woman </b>doesn't want to fit with the structures of the past, but it's not wrong for an active feminist to be motivated by their love for someone else or seek that unique sense of protection.",

Doesn't she look happy with her life choices?\n\nWho wants to stop working at 25, spend your days shopping and playing legos with your children, watching them grow, being a part of their life. At around 5:30 your husband comes home, after a log day you are both happy to see each other as he holds you in his big strong arms. Then as a family you all have dinner and a conversation together talking about how everyone's day went. Later on you put the kids to bed, and with the new found privacy you inevitably get a bit frisky before falling asleep in each other's arms.\n\nNah screw that. That's the lies of the<b>  Patriarchy</b>! No you need to get student loans for <b> a Gende</b>r Studies degree that makes you a less employable and more unpleasant person than you were going into college.  That way when you come home from your 9 hour shift serving overpriced coffee to rich commuters you can come home to your studio apartment and tell your cat all about how you got \"Sweat Shamed\" on the bus ride home. Then after watching half a season of Sherlock and pounding a fifth of Jack, you can lie alone on your futon trying to ignore the smell of cat piss and boiled ramen seasoning long enough <b> to bla</b>ck out.\n\nAnd yeah maybe marriage is as bad as you describe in the countries you listed. But here in the western world, with our horrible capitalism and post enlightenment egalitarian values, things aren't as you describe.",

Because they have husbands supporting them. (Not an opinion, by the way, a numerical fact. Check it out.) Nope, marriage is not a feminist institution. Men have let it become the most effective tool of female oppression of males ever seen. Men \u2013 don't marry her.

If she supports you, listens and cares, Marrying her and facing life together can be a wonderful thing that lifts you both up.  You are responsible for taking care of each other.  For a man to come in from work to a tidy home, happy kids, a meal on the table and someone who loves you asking how your day went might sound oppressive to some, but to me and a lot of people like me it sounds idyllic.  The Christian view of marriage is that men are the protectors and therefore the head of the household. This is because the world is full of dangers, that's why women are given away by their Dads.  It's Dad saying I trust this man to love and protect the little girl that I've raised to womanhood with love and protection (Because to a Dad, she's always be his little girl).  Feminists forget that with power comes responsibility.  They also forget what being a man or being a women means, the benefits they bring and how well the two halves fit together to make a whole when it comes to love and family.    Love should be about complimenting and completing each other.  Loves never power hungry, but always ready to give.  This dodgy geezer in this video simply doesn't understand love.",

I used to believe in marriage once and honestly didn't mind the thought of being married. Then I woke up and saw how you women REALLY fucked it up to be a deathtrap for men and a beneficial haven for women. Now the last thing I want to do is get married.\n\nCongrats, Feminists. You got what you wanted. Men aren't interested in marrying anymore, and you've harmed the women more who actually believe in the custom of marriage because us men refuse to get married. You'd have to do a heluva lot of convincing to make many men these days want to marry. Not even all the money in the world would convince me to marry.\n\n#MGTOW",

Citing a number of third-world and non-western countries where a <b> woman </b>can be raped by their spouse in a video aimed at westerners in western countries simply shows that you only wish to shock people in the shallowest way possible. \n Your aggressive shallow and biased opinions are not only offensive to the majority of the population of every western country they are also utterly uninformed and incorrect. \nMarriage is not in the day and<b>  age</b> that we live in a system put in place by men or fair to them in any way (again in western countries....again who is your audience for this video?)\nWhen marriages break down for any given reason with or without children the systems put in place greatly favour women. From a complete lack of equality when it comes to access or custody of children to the dividing of assets regardless of ability or earnings during the marriage or spousal support these systems are geared to be biased towards women.  \n\nIs Today's Guardian truly such a rag that they will let anything be published under their name with no oversight whatsoever or are they simply fishing for views with deliberately  toxic content? \n\nIf for whatever reason this video was published for the women who live in those countries mentioned then I hope that a concerted effort was made to promote and publish it in said countries. Otherwise, this video is just sensationalized shite, and if genuine just shows how truly ugly your soul is to the entire world.",

We have women now who find men obsolete and instead prefer to be married to the government rather than the father of their children.  Places which actually need some feminism are ignored by ya'll.  Seriously, go to Saudi Arabia, go to Africa and fight for the young girls who have their genitals mutilated.  Be the force to be reckoned with that ya'll claim to be!

(that's rhetorical question btw)\n\nPeople assume that Feminism main focus are useless but this is just what media keep spreading because it makes people talk and react, people want to see that stuff. It's a heaven for trolls and feminist hater.\nNow if you look the website :Feminist(<b> dot)</b>org\nin the \"campaign and action\" panel, you don't see this kind of petty problem's but real society problems.\nSo next time some internet troll say's something such as \"feminist just focus on petty problems\" or when you think something that you don't know for sure, use your fucking internet connection like a smart person and look for actual proof instead of rumor.",

Such as women didn't have as many rights and were less represented in their own country. It wasn't until recently women had the right to not be rped by her husband. In USA it seems to be a word those annoying men use, who spend too much time online being angry they can't trap a <b> woman </b>in an abusive relationship with no confudence so they spend a lot of time online being angry, swearing and calling women names, spending their time searching out examples of idiots who talk nonsense to say that's all women who want rights against men like them. Funny how they spend to much time online whinging against women, filling comment sections no matter what the subject as an excuse to whine on against feminists and saying what women should want, but no<b>  woman</b> finds an abusiv<b> e misogynis</b>t who feels threatened by women who have rights against them to be a turn on. I think men and women dislike each other more in USA than Europe. Such as women in USA who tell men they're disgusting if they haven't been circumcised doesn't do much f<b> or gend</b>er harmony, and also it's easy to find examples of idiots talking nonsense there because they think they're only country with free speech, so many talk nonsense for the sake of it and they realise what rest of world does with how annoying they are, so they blame each other",

You run away from facts, you hinder women, and worst of all you manipulate poor uninformed people into believing your garbage. You all should be ashamed of yourselves. Men and Women are supposed to live together harmoniously instead you go searching for the patriarchal Bigfoot that doesn't exist. Why do think more and more people are calling themselves egalitarians rather than feminists? It's because you all have high jacked a once morally justified movement and somehow have turned into this punchline of society. I sincerely hope you are happy with yourselves because you and you alone are the reason your movement is gasping for air.

The concept of virginity seen as purity and basically a value of a bride is also changing. I mean I don't know anyone who actually expects a bride to be a virgin nowadays really. In a time when women don't quit their work after being married the claim that marriage is a legal prostitution starts being outdated (there is still a big problem of financial violence). The name change is also slowly changing. Yes, most women still change their name and those who decide to keep their own or join it with a new one are minority but I guess a new way can be worked out. I like the idea of creating a new surname that both partners would build together, but that's another topic. So all in all what used to be a symbol of oppression changes into an empty form that bears no meaning. I think there's <b> nothing </b>anti-feminist or pro-feminist in marriage itself, the dynamics of the relationship called marriage changes as both participants accustom it to their needs.",

My view is that it would be better if women weren't so ready to sleep with anyone at the drop of a hat and then there would be less likelihood of her being heartbroken in the future.  If a man leaves a women heartbroken, it's terrible, it's equally as terrible when a women leaves a man heartbroken.   If a women takes responsibility for her body and shows herself a bit more respect men are more likely to respect her also.  The same goes the other way and if it doesn't it's simply because women are less picky.  As I said in my above comment.  You can't blame men for modern women being slutty.  If you wanted any so called power you should of been prepared to take the responsibility that comes with it.  It's what we in the real world call a harsh truth.",

It is the man who is most at risk of being abused in a marriage, particularly financially.  One specific point you got totally wrong; no married <b> woman </b>has a utility bill in her name.  All such bills are in the name of and paid by men.  This was brought home to me after my mother died and all the household accounts were in my father's name, despite the fact that by that time he'd been dead for 19 years.\n\nYou say marriage can never be feminist.  I'll curtail my celebration of this to point out the obvious flaw is this claim; today marriage can be between two feminists, of any<b>  gender</b> arrangement you can think of.  Is not a marriage between two feminists, a feminist marriage, by definition?",

The man and the wife are King and Queen, they literally use crowns. So for married and celibate priests alike marriage is very sacred. So, yeah, maybe the celibate priest might not know about marriage, but the surprising thing is that the married ones have the same opinion. Now, even in the West Deacons maybe married, so this might bring the point of ignoring the celibacy moot. Regarding lesbians, well I do not know what to make of that.

What I'm saying is that marriage is not as needed (people choosing it) as it was in the time before industrial revolution and the discovery of the pill.\n\n\"So the ball is in your court really\"\n\nGoogle some US divorce rates chart. The rates were rising slowly since XIX century and then skyrocketed around 1960, the year of the first usage of the pill. Divorce no-fault laws came some time after that (California 1969, Universal 1977) when the rates were already high. The 2nd wave feminism came after that as well. And the 3rd wave feminism is a thing since 1990s. Not to mention even younger intersectional feminism. For me it's more likely that feminism is the result, not the cause.\n\nIt's you who value one idea above other one, not me, cite:\n\n\"difference being that one of these ideas is better than the other :)\"\n\nHence my questions about what \"better\" means. So please finally explain according to what criteria you value marriage and lack of marriage.\n\n\"contesting convention (...) empirical evidence\"\n\nCould you be more specific in your claims? What convention I'm contesting? Could you cite me? Empirical evidence to what? That in 50% cases people choose to abaddon marriage? I've taken the stats from wikipedia. Not to mention that the initial marriages rate is dropping in the first place.\n\nBtw, how long back in time should I go to find this convention? Becasue if I went far enough (before agricultural revolution) I'd see no state and no marriage.\n\n\"There is such an ample collection of facts to pool to make my case\"\n\nFor sure. Though, I don't know what your case is exactly. That marriage is good (whatever that means) or is better than something else? What are the criteria?\n\nThe implication of your claim that \"the drop is caused by feminist propaganda\" is that the success of marriage is based on indoctrination. Is it also true (but opposite) in the case of pro-marriage propaganda?",

Would you like to force people into marriage somehow? Not to mention that marriage is not necessary for fatherhood.\n\nYour answer is \"it's because feminism or liberal values in general, so after removing feminist ideas the situation will go back to normal\". This is the same rethoric as feminist rethoric \"blaming <b> patriarchy\"</b>. A simple and naiive false dichotomy.\n\nWhat if lack of marriage and fatherhood is not caused by social factors i.e. feminism (hmm, parenthood is a social construct, it reminds me something) but environmental and biological factors? And feminism and liberalism is a by-product of the same factors?\n\nRambling about evil women in order to convince them to marry probably won't work.

Why would <b> any wo</b>man choose THAT?\n\nBindel - who does not enjoy the support of a husband (for obvious reasons) - has found a way to earn money by framing all men as evil oppressors of women and writing a stream of books, articles bout this.

Overall, marriage is an institution that has helped on the whole (albeit not perfectly) secure physical and economic security and well being for women, and children!\n2. Statistics consistently show that both men and women (generally) are happier when married, not to mention it is a voluntary contract, so it doesn't \"curtail women's freedom\".\n3. Modern marriage is about perpetuating male privilege? No, it is a voluntary union that both parties have the right to end for any reason. Divorces are initiated by women 70% of the time. Courts favor women when it comes to child custody and the dividing of resources after divorce. \n4. The father giving the bride away...while it may have been rooted in giving away property...NEWS FLASH...if you're a <b> woman </b>you don't have to do this at your wedding! Also, women would literally be the most expensive piece of property and terrible investment a man could ever make.\n5. Women wearing a white dress to represent purity- Men don't like marrying loose women (generally speaking), sorry, we can't help it. Biologically were looking for a<b>  woman</b> who can stick with us and help us raise the family, we've been doing it together for thousands of years. We don't hate sluts we're just not looking to marry one; but if the white dress bothers you, wear a different color.  Also, the white dress is something that is only found in a few cultural whereas marriage is virtually universal to all cultures.\n6. Then don't change your name, there is no requirement. There i<b> s nothin</b>g wrong with starting your own tradition with names although the current one works out just fine. Also, your current last name has been brought to you by \"t<b> he patriarc</b>hy\", so you already bare \"the brand\" If you were a true feminist you'd reject your last name and give yourself your own made up name like Bitchalotapotamus.\n7. You're correct about one thing, marriage CAN NEVER be a (3rd wave) feminist act, because modern marriage is egalitarian and voluntary, your brand of feminism calls for oppression and subjection of the m<b> ale </b>sex.\n\nDerp<b>  THE PATRIA</b>RCHY! Derp\n\nNext video from her Entitled: All these trolls hired b<b> y the patri</b>archy disagreeing with me in the Youtube comments have destroyed my safe space and victimized me!",

I'm American and for the past 15 years I have lived in Russia (twice), Japan, Czech Rep, Ecuador and currently (for the past 9 years) South Korea.  Asian, Russian, Eastern European and Latin American women love men, and they will appreciate your masculinity.  Most of them are also feminine, well dressed and in shape.  You will rediscover your attraction to women and you will be happy upon settling down with a foreign <b> woman,</b> that much I promise you.  Nearly all the Western men I have met or worked with over the past 15 years have had either girlfriends or wives from the host country we were working in and that includes myself.  Do yourself a favor and either get a TEFL certificate, or master's degree in TESOL and teach English abroad.  That or find a degree that will take you far and wide away from the religion of feminism.  You can even search on websites that are dedicated to finding foreign women for Western men.  On the flip side, a vast VAST majority of the Western women I have met during my time working abroad have been single (or just giving blow jobs on weekends) and I am yet to see a website dedicated to finding non-Western men for western women.  The reason is quite apparent - Feminism has made Western women undesirable and in most cases intolerable.  Do it fellas.  Foreign gals are waiting.",

            "commentText": "Just FYI: not all feminists think this!!! I honestly think this is a bit silly and it actually plays into the patriarchy's removal of women's autonomy and freedom of choice. Marriage has evolved so much since its inception. In the Middle Ages, travelling \"priests\" would have couples jump over a broomstick holding hands and then declare them married. No giving away, no business transaction. And nowadays, your average wedding is totally dissimilar to the patriarchal ideal she's suggesting here.\n\nI won't be getting married - not because of my viewpoint as a feminist but because it's honestly not a commitment I would ever feel comfortable making. That's not a political statement in and of itself - she's right in that respect - but it IS a personal one. As a <b> woman </b>making an informed and self-empowering choice, does that not qualify as a feminist action?",

Just because you don't agree with something doesn't mean its a 'stupid decision'. Notice how in my previous comment I did not produce an ad hominem? In my opinion your opinion is anger filled and not thought through properly for all sides. I think that we should all have equal rights and opportunities regardless of <b> age,</b><b>  sex</b><b> , rac</b><b> e, sexu</b>al orientation etc... So if two people make a decision together and 100% agree with each other, ignore what tradition means and are happy how is it sexist? If two females get married or two men get married is it also sexist in your eyes? Ps if your just someone looking through the comments thanks for reading, tell me your opinion c:",

In short, her narrative portrays masculinity and all those who embody as the of the enemy of women. Contemporary feminism has become so divisive.

Just because you don't agree with something doesn't make it stupid. Creating an Ad Hominem just weakens your argument.\nIf two people make a decision that both of them are 100% sure about and 100% fine with that benefits them and hurts no one what's the problem?\nIn our modern <b> age </b>and democracy,\u00a0getting married isn't sexist because people have a damn choice about what they do and don't want to do (including last name choice), its a relationship not an imprisonment for one party.\nI think instead of ranting on youtube people who want to see a difference in other countries where this is not true should go there and see how much just complaining gets them closer to their goal.",

The difference comes in divorce where in comparison men are under privileged because they lose their kids and have to pay large amounts of child support that sometimes isn't even spent on the child.

What specifically do men get in modern marriage that women don't?\"\nWhat about what the video says? men often get to name his family including her wife, it's something cultural it's 'the way it is\" so most of the time they get to avoid all the painful paperwork even though it doesn't have to be this way... this inherently make marriage sexist since there is inequality culturally within this institution, and this not invented just look around you to see how it works.\n\n\"Both can work, both can pay for the house, both can take some time off for children.\" did she ever looked at the society? of course they can work and if they do they can pay the rent and even take some time off from children, but in practice? it's not the same. When you look at how people actually live. ut's hard to work for the<b>  woman</b> when a couple usually makes a baby or two after their marriage, Some jobs can't be done if you are growing a baby inside your belly. Companies know that so they'll find a way to not employ those who will probably get a child nine months after their marriage.\nLook around you once again it's mostly women who takes care of children,  even though it's changing over time partly thanks to feminism who tries to change the way people think about couples ( men didn't just decided to help more for house tasks    #madmen   \u00a0)\n\nit's really regrettable that man are underprivileged in divorce (which is part of marriage) and I mean it, it's bad the way marriage handles money and all the problems around that. and it should be changed but feminism as a lot to carry, go on feminis<b> t(do</b>t)org and look at the compaigns&action panel. more over often after marriage, women lose their jobs or stop working to take care of children. therefore when marriage is over usually men still have their careers while women (for those who can) have to get a shitty job just to survive or go to their parents)\n\nSo this is it are you satisfied? yes, this Chantelle Reed reminds me of pro slavery slaves.",

As any move men make to do so is seen as an attack on the freedom of women.\n\n(conclusion at the start for your sake...)\nMen don't have the right to fight when the winning of that fight would put responsibilities that are supposed to be on women, back on women. For the simple fact that every man has been taught from a very young <b> age,</b> that it is their DUTY to lesson the burden placed on women. And take it on themselves. Because they can take it. And If they can't. They aren't real men.\n\n1. Men MUST pay alimony to women. Because a<b>  woman</b> provided\u00a0 free house keeping services for the entire time they were married. but don't you DARE ask who paid for her food shelter and cloths while she was married.\n\n2. <b> A woma</b>n has 20+ options for birth control, The plan B pill, Abortion, AND paternal surrender if she so chooses to have and abandon the child. Her body her choice. and demanding she take care of her own child will lead to more abortions.\n\nOnce he ejaculates he has no claim to his sperm. If she gives him a hand job with a condom on, take that condom and inseminate herself with it, He is responsible to pay her child support.\n\nIf he takes a less paying job to move closer to his child, he is\u00a0 still required to pay the child support of the higher paying job. Because he chose to take a less paying job.\n\nIf she decides she doesn't want to let hism get his child during his custody window, He has to go to court for a year for the court to <b> do nothi</b>ng to correct the issue.\n\nIf he doesn't pay his child support, He will be arrested, His driver's License suspended, and\u00a0 his wages garnished. He will also have a warrant for his arrest posted. So in the event he comes into contact with a cop, he will be assaulted caged and berated as a deadbeat by the system.\n\n3. And when men DO fight back, they are told they are over reacting, Just mad they aren't getting laid, Or just as bad as the feminists.\n\nLook at what Skeptic is saying about MGTOWs. if half of the things the system did to men, for the benefit of women; was done to women for the benefit of men, MEN would claim that our system hated women. And fight to correct it. Tell me the last time you heard a story of a mother Self-immolating herself on a courts steps because she felt she had no other course of action?\n\nMen spend hundreds of thousands of dollars fighting for rights that should by default be theirs to begin with. But because we live in a world where people like skeptic not only are able to tur<b> n a bl</b>ind eye to the abuse of men. But are given kudos for doing so, Any man or group of men fighting to change that system is painted as an over reacting bitter and sad group of cowards who are just mad they aren't getting laid.\n\nBut the irony is, men who decide they are not going to play this game. and limit their risk of this happening to them are demonized and painted as\u00a0 \"a MGTOW who thinks marriage is a conspiracy created to curtail their resources.\"\n\nAnd anyone posing the question, Well why should a man' resources be curtailed to provide for another able- bodied adult? It is countered with \"What? You hate women or something?\"",

First is that you are advocating for a change. That puts you into an awkward position because you are claiming that you have no right to do what you are blatantly doing. Another possibility is that you aren't advocating for a change and all you doing is bitching at the system. And in the very same post you are basically saying that you are not allowed to do that. And that also kind of means that you are doing what you state you can not do. See, changes in society always meets resistance, the fact that those changes have been made, proves that people can overcome resistance.",

They also should record everything, because in case this utopia turns out to be distopia where all the colony dies out each individual alone, rest of us should have an important lesson about how not to run the society.\"\n\n\"Now, if you've replaced MGTOW, with I, it would have been the most important words in this interaction. See, it is about you constantly being nagged that you haven't created a family and aren't going to. You just so used to defending yourself, justifying your decision, that you are always on defense, even when not attacked.\"\n\nYou say that. But Feminists and Certain MRAs aren't attacking me. They are attacking MGTOW. You want to make it about me. When It is not about me. It is about MGTOW. MGTOW is being attacked. If I as an individual said <b> nothing.</b> Didn't get married. No one but close family member would now to care. But when a group of men that is constantly growing says they have no desire or plan to ever get married. And lay out the reasons. People like you make asinine comments like Move out with feminists and create your utopia. Because you would much rather pretend like the points MGTOW makes about the unbalanced system is all in our heads. And we are exaggerating.\n\n50% of marriages end in divorce. Majority of the fatherless children in the world are fatherless by the choice of the mother, Who alienates their children from the father, And the system enables this. Men who cohabitate with women who have children for too long are then required by law to provide child support for children that aren't theirs. A man will be stripped of his livelihood for refusing to pay.<b>  Nothing</b> happens to <b> a woma</b>n who entraps a man, and refuses him his parental rights.\n\nYou ant to make this about me, so you can ignore the tens of thousands of men who are being destroyed by this system. And the millions of men who are basically enslaved and playing nice so they won't be. No fault divorce was legalized so women could get out of unhappy marriages with half the resources of their husbands. Because if she was to just leave. It would be her fault. And she would be entitled <b> to nothi</b>ng.\n\nYou use passive aggressive means to attack. And then feign ignorance when people call you on it. Why would MGTOW move to create a dystopia, when we get to watch THIS dystopian society eat itself. Where traditional tenants that treat all women like princesses at the expense of men is rightfully dying. And the society that has happily discarded male humanity is fighting against the push back from men. Not me. MEN.",

Could you imagine women trying to run society by themselves? & I'm not trying to degrade female intelligence or anything, there are millions of women more intelligent than I am, but c'mon... \n\nHave a closer look at which <b> sex </b>does the vast majority of the dirty & dangerous work which maintains our comfortable, advanced, & ultimately privileged society. \n\nThe police work, the army, the building, the street maintenance, the sewage work, the garbage work, the pluming, the oil work, forestry work, farming, car maintenance, & so on, so on... There's far too many to list... \n\nIt's 90 - 99% men grinding away in every physically demanding, dirty, &/or dangerous aspect of society,.\n\nAdvanced civilization would straight up collapse without men.

But thats just online shit.\n\n/watch?v=bJmC2xHN7Lo\n\nWomen really DO tend to be their own worst enemy.  They initiate most domestic violence in straight relationships too which is why men tend to be taken away in handcuffs when they inevitably retaliate.  Erin Pizzey used to run's battered women's shelters and noticed a pattern that the women who take refuge there were all perpetrating violence against their significant others FIRST.  Now she's an advocate for men's rights.\n\nFunny how feminists always turn their backs on their fore-mothers when they open their eyes to the other side of the story.",

Those studies did not surprise me in the slightest, I'm just glad it's now being exposed for the truth. \nWomen can be sadistic vile volatile angry bitter creatures, more so with spoiled entitled American women. It's such a scary problem, and the fact that women can't face the truth and stay in denial for most of their lives proves that this issue is just going to get worse. And the legal system helps make sure that women are very rarely held accountable for their own behavior. This is what leads to men going their own way MGTOW and extremely high rates of unmarried men 20-35 in the United States. \nThese feminists can't be reasoned with. The best thing to do really is ignore them. Ignore their <b> mental </b>issues, ignore their cries for \"equality\", and let them die alone with their 47 cats and their<b>  Gender</b> Studies degree framed on the wall.\n Maybe the next generation of women will be wiser",

I am a Canadian and a former PM once said that the state has no business in the bedrooms of the <b> nation.</b> I would add that dictating people are not welcome, either.\n\nI would be called a feminist- first<b>  woman</b> to take a certified skilled trade in the big 3 auto industry in my country, 3 degrees<b> , sexua</b>l experience, 5 kids and in possession of a working brain. I prefer to think of myself as a humanist- a person for all of humanity.\n\nThe facts remain that I am<b>  a WOM</b>AN and that arrived before my stance on many things in this life. The additional facts are that the LEGAL PROTECTIONS for women with children arise out of the laws that men created because they were fully aware of what men get up to. Do they always work- of course not- what does? However, I can guarantee you that if at the end of a relationship you are counting on HIS GOOD WILL to take care of your children-ASK THE KIDS. Research indicates that they only love and care for the children of <b> the wo</b>man they are sexually involved with.\n\nSo, I will put my feminist qualifications smack up against yours.  I claim the right to live life the way I see fit and not to toe some FEMINIST LINE or some other line but the line I BELIEVE to be BEST.\n\nAND just to add fuel to the fire, I will tell you that I changed my name (my daughter in law is not and that is equally ok). No one could spell my birth name and GUESS WHAT - that was MY DAD's patriarchal INDEED- so why should I be attached to it? I liked my ex's name- it had a meaning and I told my kids that the point in life is to BUILD and not to destroy. When my ex left for a 24 <b> year</b> old (hey, feminists, maybe you should chat with the younger members of your ranks about helping to destroy families), I kept the name until my kids were all grown up (it makes it far easier for schools to know who is the mamma) until such time as I chose to remarry- and I liked the new name EVEN BETTER- it suited ME even better.",

Most female circumcisions involved the alteration of the labia. The cutting off of the clit is the rarest form of female circumcision. But you are pretending like it's the only type. Why is it illegal to alter the labia of a girl without cutting her clit off, then?\n\nAlso, a porn actress (or any adult for that matter) has every right to do whatever damage she wants to her own body. How the fuck is that in any way similar to tying an infant down and cutting their genitals off?",

And i saw that the trauma is much more important for that <b> woman.</b> First because the awareness of the fact that prepuce is the most sensitive part is not know to anyone (especially for the boy), and they do it when they are baby so they cannot remember (i didnt said the scare is not there). Also the scare is less visible. I mean by someone else. Some male like when it is with not clit, they said you look more respectful.\nSecond female is more rare, so when it is done to you, you feel really different. And also it is more painful for the<b>  sexual</b> relationship specially at the beginning.\n\nAnd as i said they are not done for the same reasons.\n\nPlus i believed that when mother and father know that is th<b> e sexua</b>l pleasure part they will not remove it for boys that's for sure.\nBut i am not so sure f<b> or wom</b>an because they do it so they have l<b> ess sex</b>ual pleasure (so they are more fidelity)",

I felt it suggested that there is still this contemporary patriarchal intention to hoodwink women and showboat oppression on the sly by continuing these traditional rituals, even feminist women unknowingly snaring themselves into supporting the emblematic routines of inequality. \n\nIt's a very interesting piece on the historical echo of European weddings and of different socially constructed times, illuminating a time of clear inequality, or at least highlighting the inequality to females in that position. I would strongly bet though that none of these culturally inherited rituals or aesthetics of virginity/white dress etc keep that meaning anymore, and have now become visual parts to a holistic experience of what feels like a wedding to us now, devoid of it's original association. Now they are cultural props to help create the ubiquitously familiar ambiance to celebrate two people in love wanting to be together under contract (basically what it is), as it's done in a way that requires the historical gravitas to validate the legitimacy of the act(of course, this is subjective to each couple, nor is it mandatory to have a traditional wedding). \n\nHaving to be educated on the unfortunate history is a good sign, as it means those values are no longer held and have been forgotten, allowing this 'supposed' loophole for feminist to support the<b>  patriarchy</b> a bit of a silly way to present an argument. I was ignorant to the history, much like I'm ignorant about the history of morris dancing, candles on a cake, or children's truce terms when playing hide and seek, as children are to the song ring of roses. How it was put forward was like pointlessly adding bees to a long extinct nest to the<b> n pro</b>d it a bit, mainly by the slightly hostile undertone to the presentation.",

Most women and men only accept those ways because they know there is no such thing as freedom of speech in these types of countries and know they are at risk of death or even imprisonment if they exercise their freedom of speech. You're using the \"Because they like it, we should just ignore it\" mentality although it is blatantly inhumane the way people are treated over there. I'm not saying the West is any better but any halfwit can tell that these people are being treated worse than animals thus why I concentrate most of my activism on them. Maybe if people in the West concentrated on them too, there would be a change instead of crying at how people who voluntarily marry (not talking about forced weddings or child weddings) is sexist and wrong.\n\nAnd next time, make your comment link to my actual one instead of saying women aren't oppressed as a group as if I was saying that. \"I'm just saying\" - And? I never stated that in my comment so there was no point in you adding that.\n\nBut since you want to go ahead and talk about that, if one<b>  woman</b> is oppressed in an inhumane way, it's our job to look out for her.",

On an intellectual level, I agree with you completely and will argue your corner and happily discuss the ins and outs of the marriage malarkey- but on a personal level I must disagree! While there are many, many, MANY instances of oppression that are directly aided by the act of marriage, it is all still circumstantial to ones birthplace, community, family and theology etc. We can all work together to help those less fortunate in their circumstance than ourselves, but when it comes down to it, if I love a man enough, then I would like to marry him and be together for as long as we can stand each other! :D \nGood video though- made me think a little deeper on the matter. And not that you need telling, but many of these other commenters are morons :D",

That's what I've heard. But that's not the reason people wear them today. Women get married in white dresses because they look nice. Wedding dresses are beautiful. But there is no obligation. You can get married in a trouser suit if you like. You don't even have to get married in a church, instead doing it at your local registrar. \n\nWomen are not obliged to change their names. But when there is a family unit, it is practical for all members to have the same family name. There are men who adopt their wife's name. There are families who join the two family names together. There i<b> s nothin</b>g oppressive about a modern marriage. The traditions may be a little outdated, but it doesn't mean they are representative of what they once were.",

People living in tribes, for example, are perfectly capable of sharing child-care, even if the parents die. While it might seem to you that monogamous relationships are human nature, someone from a polygamous society would probably see their forms of relationships as the natural order.

To raise that child requires commitment, otherwise the child won't survive. Marriage was our cultural way of enshrining that commitment required, making it binding in law (and before god), and not easily dissolved.\n\nI see no moral problem with polygamy. But if a man has several wives, he also has to be able to provide for those wives (and eventual children). This takes a great deal of resources and (in modern society) money. Polygamy would have been a sign of prestige and power among the community. Average people would not have been quite so widely \n\nThe monogamous relationship is the most simple of relationships. Simple in principle, and efficient in practice (because it is simple). The wider society is irrelevant when considering it is the two parents who are intended to raise the children.\n\nLike I said, the cultural institution marriage has come about because of several factors. The modern marriage remains because people still fall in love, and want to commit themselves to being together -- the \"human condition\". That urge to be together, with a probable child (or children) in the future, ultimately would have brought a form of commitment promise. I.e., marriage.",

They don't fight for all the little things that make them unequal in society. We tell women what to wear how to talk ect. Not pretty enough? Wear make up, not tall enough? wear heels, your hair is not good enough hide it or wear a wig. The list goes on and on but u don't see feminist fighting for any of this they just want equal pay \" I don't care how u treat me just pay me the same\". They ignore everything else because they have been brainwashed into thinking that is actually their decision to do all this things that is just to please men and look good for them. \" I don't wear make up for men I like wearing a mask that's poisoning my skin\". I don't wear heels for men I like wearing uncomfortable shoes that I can barely walk on and it would break my ankle if I make a mistake\". Just like the women from the middle East that say they like covering themselves from top to bottom in a country where is extremely hot. Sure they do. If u wanna fix inequality u gotta start with the little things like marriage and work u way up to the big ones like equal paid. The problem is they embrace the actual things that makes them unequal.",

However, what the video picks up on is the fact that marriage does have historical roots in such behaviour and that this is hard to disregard. I don't necessary share JB's negative view of marriage but can see that, just because marriage looks very different now, it necessarily contains echoes of an historically oppressive institution. She isn't saying people shouldn't do it, but is taking issue with those trying to overlook the uncomfortable origins of an institution they are joining.",

The whole point of\u00a0 the video is now derailed to some individual men and hypermasculinity (note hypermasculinity, not masculinity) being the problem.

She isin a way\u00a0 saying\u00a0 women \"shouldn't do it\", since\u00a0 it is not feminist to do so (an argument based on her radical feminist position). I don't agree with her\u00a0 either but am not familiar enough with the literature this is based on (and ten minutes of intentional punditry\u00a0 can't be anything but entertaining stepping stones ).\n\nLike any other video with \"feminist\" in the title, the vast majority of youtube comments will be from people hate-watching videos like this to tell the world their \"personal\" opinion on a philosophical position they made <b> zero </b>effort in educating themselves about.

This is reasoned stuff though, and good to see people agreeing, and after putting their opinions across so intelligently.\n\nI agree with you Morgan Roete, that the focus of feminist discussion shoudn't be about whether men feel accused/targeted/excluded. But it is a fair point from ugaaa5. I'm divided: I don't think concessions should be made so that men will feel comfortable, but on the other hand if men are included, wouldn't that be a good thing? I suppose the onus is on men to get beyond that feeling of being accused, to accept like wellybeana says that the patriarchal system is one that we've benefitted from. A bit of swallowing one's pride can be very healthy.\n\nI also think that JB is being deliberately provocative, because it's important that we as a society are having these discussions. She isn't saying that every <b> woman </b>in a loving marriage is being oppressed. But I think the system does need to be changed, and we need to throw off any vestiges of patriarchal  symbolism.\n\nHowever, ugaaa5, I'm going to have to disagree with you on arranged marriages. Forced marriage is one thing, but I don't see a worse problem with arranged marriages than there is with Western (or otherwise non-arranged) marriages. If you have any Muslim friends you should ask them about it (since most Muslims practice arranged marriages). It's certainly very different, but I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. You do get a choice, you know. Plus if you meet someone you'd like to marry, generally you will be able to marry them. (I'm sure some horrendous situations exist where this isn't the case.) It's just that the parents of the couple are much more involved than in other marriage systems. And that can really help to build a stable relationship between the two families.
