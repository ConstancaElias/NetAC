            "commentText": "The laws in place protecting people from <b> age </b>discrimination are very clear and are constructed in such a way that makes it near impossible to prosecute perpetrators successfully. The recognizable signs of the acts of<b>  age</b> discrimination, both overt and covert, are so well known, and hence avoided by the perpetrators, that the possibility of any legal success in prosecution of the offense is impossible. The usual offenders can either afford to employ a legal department or keep legal counsel on retainer to protect their interests...individuals typically cannot afford this luxury. Employers use instructional videos that all employees are required to view, that address these laws, so employers can 'wash their hands' of any liability, while they themselves practice the abuse o<b> f ag</b>e discrimination without repercussion. There are several reasons why the success rate of offender prosecution is negligible. States that are in the 'Right to Work' category, enjoy bathing in the ability to execute <b> an a</b>ge-based termination without ethical justification or having to prove why. This burden falls on the victim who can nether prove, much less afford to prove the act of discrimination. The EEOC who is in place to provide protections in this area has proven to be useless in its management<b>  of </b>age discrimination claims and does littl<b> e to not</b>hing to help the victims. There is also no money to be made in the attempt to <b> prov</b>e age discrimination, so victims are further victimized by a system designed to protect the perpetrator\u2026not the abused. Employers are 'encouraged' by health organizations to 'find ways' to keep costs low and in so<b>  doi</b>ng age discrimination is employed through the use of higher premiums and/or termination of the older worker. This results in what we currently have today, which are useless laws that are used to identify 'what' are considered valid exam<b> ples</b> of age discrimination, as defined by current law, used by legal counsel to 'coach' the perpetrators avoidance rather than ethical governance of a fair, just, and non-discriminatory work environment. IF these laws worked, we would see an equitable distribution of ages represented in the workplace, but that is not the case. While there may be a few instances, they are far and few between and few employers demonstrate that e<b> quit</b>able age distribution is being practiced in the workplace today. We all su<b> ffer</b> from age-based discrimination\u2026some of us sooner than others but one day it will happen to all of us who are lucky(?) enough to last that long.",

If you can\n try to follow the example that I personally checked and rechecked. I \nwork with 5 close friends and all agreed to submit their Facebook \ncredentials to prove the discrimination against older Facebook males. \nTwo males profiles, one 30's and one 50's. Three female profiles, one \n20's one 30's and one 40's. I selected a real profile knowing every \ndetail of the profile to search, a person with an unusual name but not \ntoo<b>  weird</b> and not to<b> o commo</b>n. Kate Moorehouse (Barbie). When searching \nthis name the younger females could search her name and she appeared in \nthe results even though out of one of the females two of the females had\n no connection to Kate at all. The younger male could not find her in a \nseach until he had at least three oth<b> er comm</b>on friends with Kate. Then \nin the search result she appeared only after searching her entire first \nand last name. The 50 y<b> ear </b>old male could not search her. Even when he \nentered her first and last name and her entered nickname the search \nwould not locate Kate Moorehouse (Barbie) not possible because Facebook \nwould not allow an older male to see that profile. When Kate's home \ntown, home city, employment were entered with her first and last name \nand nick name she didn't appear. The older male had to go to a friend, \nselect her out and when he pushed the friend request Facebook warned \nonly send request to people you know. Even though the older male's \naccount was in good standing. When<b>  the</b> old male again pushed continue \nFacebook would not send the request stating he could only send request \nto people he knew, and if he didn't understand that to contact Facebook.\n I have attempted to contact Facebook over a few months about various \nstories and have never, never ever heard any response from Facebook. \nOkay s<b> o th</b>e old guy doesn't talk to the young girl, but what other check\n roadblocks does Facebook use to determine real life situations. Could \nthis guy go up at the library and talk to this young girl appropriately,\n sure, but not on Facebook's real life situations?",

It does not matter when you are looking for work HOW qualified you are, the point is whether you can do the job or not and that what it is all about. I think the idea some employers have is that, because you clearly have plenty of brain power, you will simply not stay in the job and be looking elsewhere one you have attained working status. It does not work like that. Older people, apart from having experience under the belt, tend to have other skills, I call transferable. Those skills you take through life with you, which you have either learned from others or gained yourself.  If you are still not working, I can only wish you luck and maybe a change of path may be on the cards. Something you like doing, but would not normally think it's you.  Maybe the unemployed should form their own co-operatives.",
