        "postText": "Solange wrote a song about it. Emma Dabiri has written a fantastic book about it.', 'Yet in the year of our good Lord 2019, white people (women more so) are still rooting their hands through Black women\u2019s hair \u2013 whether natural, braided, wigged or weaved \u2013 completely unsolicited.', 'There are so many ways to compliment a Black woman\u2019s hair without going out of your way to touch it. The easiest way? By simply saying \u2018I like your hair!\u2019. That\u2019s literally it.', 'This past week, I attended an event where the majority of attendees were middle aged white women and in the hour that I was there, no fewer than six women came up to me and plunged their hands into my hair.', 'One woman told me, while doing so, that she knew she wasn\u2019t supposed to, but she\u2019d do it anyway. I removed my hair from her grip and told her that it was incredibly inappropriate and rude, then walked away and left the event.', 'I recently started sporting this magnificent, excellent afro and I knew that wearing this style would garner some stares and attention in public, as well as a degree of interest.', 'What I didn\u2019t anticipate, however, was to have a plethora of unclean hands digging around my \u2018fro when I least expected it. I felt like an animal at a petting zoo; not cool at all.', 'Upon retelling the story on Twitter, I was met with a few queries from white women asking why touching Black women\u2019s hair was seen as a huge problem.', '*le sigh*.', 'Black women have been using our hair to make more than just fashion statements for hundreds of years. It can also be used as a political statement and a way to express our personalities and confidence.', 'During the early stages of civilization, Black women would have beautiful textured hairstyles to show off their status, and this fascination with the texture of Black hair is certainly not new.', 'Back during slavery, white women would often cut off the hair of enslaved female servants because it supposedly \u2018confused white men\u2019.', 'Given this, not only is it just plain rude, and a disgusting abuse of personal space to touch a Black women\u2019s hair, but it is also a super common racial microaggression, which is a subtle form of racism often done by someone who doesn\u2019t \u2018mean\u2019 to be racist.', 'The objectification of Black bodies has been a part of US and British culture since slavery, and it\u2019s still going strong as one of our everyday struggles.', 'But hold on a minute \u2013 when you touch Black women\u2019s hair, you don\u2019t have racist or sexist intentions! So how does this relate to racism or sexism?', 'The answer comes down to one of our core feminist values \u2013 consent and respecting everyone\u2019s agency over their own bodies, including their hair. Having our hair touched is just one of the ways Black women are often denied this agency in our society.', 'Let\u2019s go into some reasons why white women may want to touch our hair, and reasons why this is a no-go.', 'When they say they are doing it as a compliment: this is a tough one, because I appreciate the good intentions, but then I feel bad for rejecting the compliment.', 'For many of us, natural hair is a political statement of embracing our beauty instead of the idea that we have to change to be acceptable.', 'Take what happened to me above as an example. I arrived at the venue with my hair all fluffed and shaped out, looking amazing. I wouldn\u2019t mind at all if you were to say how great my hair looks.', 'But then you reach out, telling me my hair is beautiful and you\u2019d give anything to run your fingers through it. And we have to stop you right there, because you\u2019re shifting from a kind compliment into fascination territory. It\u2019s not flattering to be petted like a strange creature \u2013 even if you mean it in a \u2018good\u2019 way.', '\u2018I wouldn\u2019t be offended if someone touched my hair\u2019: That\u2019s great for you, but If you treat others like you\u2019d want to be treated, you should respect Black women\u2019s boundaries like you\u2019d want yours respected \u2013 even if their boundaries are different from yours.', 'Because for me and many other Black women, it\u2019s more than \u2018just hair\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s a vital source of empowerment. For many of us, natural hair is a political statement of embracing our beauty instead of the idea that we have to change to be acceptable.', 'So owning and loving our hair is a revolutionary act of reclaiming our worth. It\u2019s an integral part of our cultural experience. A white person touching our hair carries a different context than when you, as a white person whose humanity is affirmed far more often, have someone touch your hair.', 'You find our hair fascinating: sometimes my hair stirs up more than curiosity \u2013 it fills people, like the women at the event I attended, with wonder. Yet being fascinating can be a bad thing.', 'Black women are often \u2018othered\u2019 in society, often treated as if we don\u2019t exist by the media.', 'Our hair is othered with insults and misunderstandings and even when the othering seems \u2018positive,\u2019 it still doesn\u2019t feel good. It essentially disrupts our efforts to simply exist without being treated like we\u2019re abnormal.', 'When you rarely see Black women in the media, and even \u2018positive\u2019 images objectify us, you\u2019re influenced to treat Black women as objects. That\u2019s not a good thing.', 'People can say it\u2019s \u2018just\u2019 hair. But it\u2019s an extension of one\u2019s self and an expression of our identity. To infringe upon and police our hair is to deny us agency.', 'If we can\u2019t run our own hair, we certainly have no ownership of ourselves. My hair is one of the ways I have control over my image \u2013 it\u2019s not just some anomaly for people to touch. Let me reclaim my own beauty and exist without being exoticised.",
