        "postText": "Imagine that you have parked your car in your drive, and are about to walk into your home, when you hear \u2018F**k off back to your country\u2019.', 'It literally freezes you, the shock numbs you.', 'I immediately thought I must have heard wrong. I asked, \u2018What did you say?\u2019 He repeated it three more times, to make sure I understood that I didn\u2019t belong here.', 'I have lived in the same village for years and have never felt that I was so different from my neighbours who are mainly white English. I am a Kurd, but despite being from a different background, I felt safe and lived well. Then a new neighbour moved in just a few hundred metres away from my home and everything changed.', 'Not long after they moved in they covered their window that faced directly at my home with UKIP signs. But perhaps they felt I didn\u2019t get the message because soon my neighbour and his associates made it their mission to turn my vibrant home life into one of solitary confinement.', 'They tried to humiliate me every time I stepped out of my home, waiting outside in groups, drunk.', 'They swore at me, called me \u2018ISIS\u2019 and spat at me. My car was vandalised repeatedly, the entrance to my drive was blocked.', 'I stopped going out totally and had to keep my curtains shut all the time. If I showed any sign of living, the abuse would start again. The English national anthem would be played very loudly from a car parked next to my window. The whole section of wall facing my living room was covered with St George\u2019s flags.', 'I have no issue with flags or national anthems of any country, especially with the English ones. My living situation isn\u2019t an accident \u2013 I choose to live here. I love the English language, love reading it, hearing it.', 'I wanted to read Shakespeare and Seamus Heaney in English, not through translations \u2013 us Kurds are bilingual by birth: we learn our mother tongue and study in the language of our surrounding geography. I for one am fluent in Turkish.', 'To this day I still can\u2019t pin point why anyone would want to be racist but perhaps I was an easy target \u2013 as a woman, I moved here on my own and had no immediate family living in this country.', 'As a result of constant racial abuse I became extremely ill. At first I thought I was having a heart attack but I saw my GP on an emergency appointment and found out that I was experiencing an anxiety attack.', 'I was told by authorities to ignore it and laugh it off but it is not funny and this is not a situation you can play down or sweep it under the carpet.', 'I lost my sense of security. I was afraid that they would throw acid in my face. I got uncontrollable shakes but I didn\u2019t want my neighbour to see me unable to defend myself.', 'I reported the abuse to the police but as I was always on my own when it took place, and because my neighbour was always in a group, it was my word against theirs.', 'I was told by authorities to ignore it and laugh it off but it is not funny and this is not a situation you can play down or sweep under the carpet. Ignoring it and laughing will only invite more tragedy. My neighbour has since died but I still face harassment.', 'I called both the emergency 999 number and the non-emergency number, 101, over 100 times. Calls to 999 are free of charge \u2013 all telecoms providers operating in the UK are obliged to provide a free-of-charge emergency operator as part of their licence agreement.', 'But I recently learned that there is a 15p per call charge for 101 non-emergency calls from both landlines and mobile networks, no matter what time of day you call, or how long you are on the phone. In some cases the charge is much higher: for example, my service provider is Vodafone and they charge 55p per minute.', 'I am now petitioning the Home Office to make calls to 101 free. I fear that the cost could discourage victims reporting crimes against them or witnesses from getting in touch with information. If we want the public to engage with the police we should reduce the barriers, not create them.', 'By no means will simply reporting incidents demolish racism or hate crimes but we need to start somewhere \u2013 if you see it or experience it, report it. This is the first step that we can take against hate crime perpetrators, and then we can ask and expect the police to do their job.', 'We are all members of different and overlapping communities, so it\u2019s everyone\u2019s responsibility to be involved in ending all types of hate crime towards anyone.', 'As Seamus Heaney once wrote: \u2018once in a lifetime / The longed-for tidal wave / Of justice can rise up\u2019.",

With that level of disingenuous ownership, I have difficulty believing any thing they say with the 15p charge for 101 being the only factual element provided. If you think you're in danger you should only use 999 and if the call handler dismissed it (unlikely) then you would be within your rights to at least lodge a complaint if not go so far as to start legal proceedings against the call centre involved.",
