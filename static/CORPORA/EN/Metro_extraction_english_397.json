        "postText": "Piers Morgan has begged his loyal following to sign a petition to keep him in his Good Morning Britain job after a campaign called for his removal.', 'The controversial television host, who revealed earlier today that he\u2019ll be debating whether or not he should be fired from his position on tomorrow\u2019s show, has asked his 6.8million Twitter fanbase to show their support by adding their signatures to a Change.org appeal.', '\u2018BREAKING: There is now a rival petition to save me on @GMB,\u2019 Piers wrote. \u2018Thank you Margaret Lowry! Please sign it if you wish to repel the snivelling snowflakes & keep me in my job.\u2019', 'In another post, he added: \u2018Spread the word, my people\u2026 Sign, RT, and save me as your voice against the shriekingly illiberal liberals who want to cancel everyone who dares challenge them\u2026\u2019', 'The description of the campaign, which so far has 2,414 supporters, reads: \u2018Keep Piers Morgan for his common-sense approach to life. He\u2019s also funny!!', '\u2018He\u2019s not afraid to speak out and says what a lot of us are thinking.\u2019', 'The petition comes days after angry viewers called for Piers to be removed from Good Morning Britain for his treatment of the LGBT+ community.', '\u2018Morgan dictates to his viewers that it\u2019s acceptable to deny an LGBTQ+ person of their rights; it\u2019s acceptable to tell them they don\u2019t exist; it\u2019s acceptable to call them \u201csnowflakes\u201d when they get rightfully upset,\u2019 part of the petition\u2019s description reads.', '\u2018These are the lessons Morgan teaches. ITV, as a major broadcasting corporation with a worldwide reach, are currently tarnishing a long-lasting legacy by using one of their highest-performing programmes as a vehicle to spread hate and intolerance.\u2019', 'It goes on to add: \u2018I understand that viewers are important, numbers mean business and high engagement suggests success, but are there really no other ways to achieve it? Despite Good Morning Britain\u2019s current performance, to be conscious of a majority of their viewership being sexist, racist, transphobic, and generally unwilling to accept minorities or viewpoints aside from their own is repulsive, for lack of a better term\u2026', '\u2018Wake up to the reality of Morgan\u2019s behaviour. Hate crimes are on the rise, transphobia and discrimination over gender identity is becoming commonplace both upon social media and in the real world, and ITV continue to sit idly and let it play out in the name of entertainment.', '\u2018It should be obvious by now that this has far surpassed an acceptable threshold, with Morgan\u2019s rhetoric and actions sitting firmly in dangerous territory.\u2019', 'Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.",
