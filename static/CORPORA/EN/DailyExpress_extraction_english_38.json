It follows claims Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described Theresa May as a \u201cstupid women\u201d during yesterday\u2019s Question Time. A professional lip-leader lent weight to the allegation, which Mr Corbyn denies.', 'During a debate on Mr Corbyn\u2019s alleged comment, Ms Sandbach commented: \u201cI think that the language since Brexit has substantially deteriorated.', '\u201cThere is a deep attack on women both from the far-right and the far-left and I think this has been fed by Brexit.\u201d', 'Mr Corbyn insisted he said \u201cstupid people\u201d rather than \u201cstupid women\u201d adding he was \u201copposed to the use of sexist and misogynist language in any form\u201d.', 'Commons Speaker, John Bercow, said he had not witnessed the alleged incident.', 'He added it had not been picked up by microphones, but it was \u201ceasy to see why the leader of the opposition\u2019s words might be construed as \u2018stupid woman\u2019.\u201d', 'He added a professional lipreader had been consulted, and had lent weight to the conclusion.', 'Ms Sandbach\u2019s opinion was backed by Labour MP Rupa Huq, who appeared alongside her on Newsnight.', 'She said: \u201cI do agree that since Brexit there\u2019s been a coarsening of the debate.\u201d', 'Ms Huq added she wasn\u2019t sure whether Mr Corbyn said the alleged words and claimed lip readers came to differing conclusions.', 'During yesterday\u2019s debate Commons leader Andrea Leadsom informed Speaker Bercow that he had yet to apologise for apparently describing her as a \u201cstupid woman\u201d during a previous debate.', 'Shortly after the Speaker\u2019s Office commented that \u201cstrong and differing views\u201d had been expressed.', 'Mr Bercow commented yesterday that he had dealt with the matter.",

They espouse a process that defies the will of the people, as decided in the 2016 referendum, by insisting that we back a deal Mays that ties us in to potentially decades of subservience to the EU, and loss of our sovereignty and right to self governance. We voted to LEAVE, Mays deal is not LEAVING. The only option presently available that meets the result of the referendum is to LEAVE under WTO rules. We managed before the EU existed, we will do well once out of its grasp. It\u2019s sad that these remoaning women cannot see beyond their slavish admiration of the EU.",
