Right.\n\nAnd then you start talking about hard statistical facts? Really? You are the person who tries to deny any inherent stupidity in your statement and yet you say this? Where are these supposed hard statistical facts? In a video that has a like to dislike ratio of 1 to 2 and where 90 percent of comments are talking about how untrue it is you claim it is based around facts? If anything they lied or manipulated data in most if not all of their statements and conclusions. This really should be obvious to anyone who has IQ over room temperature. They claimed women died double the amount men did in hospitals for god's sake! If that isn't the most stupid statement a supposedly reputable news company has to offer it's viewers I don't know what is.  \n \nAlso you think it's boring for news to be neutral and informative? Well thought luck, the news isn't there to entertain you, but to inform you without any sort of bias. If you want to be entertained go watch one of those cringy late night liberal shows which I am certain you are a fan of, but don't expect the news to share your flawed beliefs.\n\nAnd you claim every human being understands the world from their own subjective point of view. And I won't deny that. However when it comes to researching information about a topic all subjective bias should get thrown out the window beforehand. Every scientist understands this completely as it is widely known in their circles that sampling bias, or expectation bias can widely alter the result of an experiment and would thus provide incorrect information. Additionally it is not the news company's job to publish political propaganda. Their job is strictly to inform in a completely unbiased and neutral manner. Because even though I am not opposed to disagreements per say I don't want things I and lots of other people find completely and utterly wrong to be pushed down my throat every single day under the pretence of showing the news. People shouldn't have to change the TV channel is order to find the other side of the story, they shouldn't have to search other media to see alternative theories. The news should be one and the same whichever media you decide to look at. I wouldn't have this problem if the financial times labeled themselves as a political media with a clearly defined political position. But when they define themselves as a news organisation which is commited to unbiased journalism and the objective search for the truth I simply completely oppose any sort of political opinions being thrown around especially on social issues which isn't even the priority of this organisation.",

They don't care about \"likes rate\". That's for inferior beings like you. \n\n\n2.- Humans gathered in groups (corporations), have a <b> common </b>agenda,<b>  common</b> interests and goals.

To give you an example the amount of money the goverment spends on pencils will be lower than the amount spends on fuel. That doesn't mean working people are being discriminated in comparison to commuting people. There's just a certain amount of money you can spend on pencils for goverment workers efficiently\n5)roads are very important for the economy hence it improves everyone lives\n\nNow for the personal criticism:\n1) I only watched 2 minutes and during that time you managed to be so damn wrong in everything you say that it makes me question whether you're doing it on purpose as a form of art\n2) you clearly have no analytical skills, your statistical data is questionable and you have no understanding of correlation vs causation\n3)you find problems in areas where it doesn't exists creating more seperation between the 2 genders instead of bringing them together as just humans\n4)you should be fired for such an incredibly bad job\nWtf is this FT you should be credible",

Spending is NOT by <b> gender.</b> It's by NEED. Travelling by car is not a priviledge it's a hassle. Also if spend is on something that a majority of men use, it is still not by<b>  sex</b> (a minority of women still use the same so its to their benefits too). Also most people live in families and contribute back to those families. So any spend to benefit one familiy member benfits all other members. \n\nThe whole video is premissed on hogwash.",

You say it yourself: 'a minority of the women will still use it...', exactly pointing out that it helps men more than women. This is the point of the whole video: there's inherit bias in the society and the models we use (and choices based on them) may exacerbate it even more.\n\nI don't understand how you can classify as 'hogwash' examples based on real data and facts exposed in the video.",
