        "postText": "A black woman has shared a video of the moment a white woman called police on her because she was stood outside her building while waiting for an Uber.', 'Darsell Obregon filmed as the woman fumed at police that she was \u2018standing on private property\u2019 while she claims she was simply standing in the street and sheltering in the woman\u2019s doorway in Park Slope, a wealthy area in Brooklyn.', 'Posting the footage to Facebook, Darsell said: \u2018I hid in the doorway outside of a random apartment in Park Slope to shield myself from the rain and call an Uber. No more than three minutes later a young woman who lives in the building opened the front door and told me that I cannot stand there.\u2019', 'Darsell claims the woman, identified as Arabella Juniper Torres, demanded she leave.', '\u2018I told her I was not going to move (unbeknownst to her I was just waiting for my ride and would be leaving in a couple of minutes) so then she proceeded to call the police,\u2019 Darsell posted, alongside the hashtags #thisisamerica and #whiteprivilege.', 'In the clip, Torres is heard telling police: \u2018Are you sending an officer because now she\u2019s recording me.', '\u2018I\u2019m asking her to leave and she\u2019s ignoring me.\u2019', 'She goes on to describe Darsell on the phone, referring to her as \u201950, heavy set\u2019 before adding \u2018she\u2019s black\u2019.', 'She later adds: \u2018I absolutely do not know her and that\u2019s why I want her off my property.', '\u2018We\u2019re the owners of this building.\u2019', 'In a separate video filmed after the Uber had arrived, Torres tells the person on the phone \u2018she\u2019s trying to leave\u2019 and then tells the driver of the car: \u2018If you go anywhere you\u2019ll be committing a crime too you know that.\u2019', 'The video has caused outrage online and has become the latest in a string of videos showing white people allegedly calling police on black people for no apparent reason.', 'In June, a white woman called police after spotting an eight-year-old black girl selling bottles of water near her home.', 'In a video filmed by the little girl\u2019s cousin the woman, later identified as Alison Ettel, can be heard telling what is believed to be the police that someone is \u2018illegally selling water without a permit\u2019.",
