        "postText": "'Women\u2019s groups fear that self-identification will compromise the safety of women in female-only spaces such as changing rooms. The Lib Dems want to make it easier for transgender people to establish their gender identities by amending the Gender Recognition Act. Currently under the terms of the Act, anyone who wants to confirm a change in their gender identity must go through a number of procedures.', 'These include obtaining a doctor 's diagnosis of gender dysphoria, providing proof of living in their preferred gender for two years, being assessed by a panel of medical experts, as well as paying a fee of around \u00a3140.', ' In response to campaigns by transgender groups and activists, the Lib Dems propose to remove the requirement for medical reports, scrap the fee and recognise non - binary gender identities. ', 'The Lib Dems candidate and former Labour MP Luciana Berger defended the party\u2019 s new policy, saying that the party was committed to gender equality. ', ' She said: In the same way we fought for equality for sexuality, for people from different ethnic backgrounds, this is one of those equalities we are working through and fighting for equality as well.', 'There should not be hierarchies of equalities.', 'Women\u2019 s groups, though, have criticised the policy initiative, saying that it is open for abuse and could endanger the safety of women. ', ' Dr Heather Brunskell - Evans, co - founder of the Women\u2019 s Human Rights Campaign, said: The obvious examples are changing rooms, sports centres, prisons, and hospital wards.', 'There are also women who may have been sexually abused or violated in some way that find it difficult to be with male bodied people whether those people are harmless or not.', 'At the policy launch, Ms Berger also took the opportunity to attack Jeremy Corbyn over his failure to combat anti - Semitism in the Labour Party. ', 'The former Labour MP for Liverpool Wavetree resigned from the Labour Party earlier this year after being subjected to anti - Semitic attacks by party activists.', 'She blamed Jeremy Corbyn for setting the ton, and creating a party machine that\u201c protects and normalises anti semitic ideas and individuals.', ' She told journalists: The party is now led by someone who has himself defended a clear anti-Semitic mural, who has called for Holocaust memorial day to be renamed, who was present at a wreath laying ceremony for terrorists who killed Jewish people, who stood in the way of the internationally recognised definition of anti-semitism being adopted by Labour.', 'Ms Berger added: To every voter considering supporting Labour at this election, I ask them to consider who can you for vote for this.', 'What message does it send to not just the Jewish community but any minority community in the country.', 'The issue of anti-Semitism is continuing to plague the beleaguered Labour leader.', 'In the latest setback, a string of high profile public figures wrote an open letter that was published in the Guardian, saying that they could not vote for Mr Corbyn.', 'The authors John Le Carr\u00e9 and William Boyd were joined by Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, the actor Simon Callow , and the historians Antony Beevor, Tom Holland and Dan Snow in declaring they could not vote Labour on account of the party\u2019s failure to tackle anti-Semitism.', 'They wrote: Opposition to racism cannot include surrender in the fight against antisemitism.', 'Yet that is what it would mean to back Labour and endorse Mr Corbyn for Downing Street. The path to a more tolerant society must encompass Britain\u2019s Jews with unwavering solidarity.', 'We endorse no party. However, we cannot in all conscience urge others to support a political party we ourselves will not.', ' We refuse to vote Labour on 12 December.'",

A friend of mine, many years ago was so relieved to learn that as she had no idea why she wasn't like other females. This is what angers me about pushing physically normal youngsters - grooming - to identify as something they are not, wasting medical resource for a current whim, when there are people born for whom <b> gender </b>is a real physical problem. And as for men in frocks wandering about female loos or changing rooms - well, words fail me. Actually, mixed loos are also horrible. And I speak from experience as I spent most of my early life as a 'tomboy', hated all those things associated with girls such as dolls / frocks etc!Thank goodness we didn 't have people like Jo and the Libdems pushing anything or my daughters would never have been born.",
