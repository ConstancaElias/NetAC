I hope to meet her one day since I am so taken with the area of Newark as one of my favorite radio stations, WBGO, is located there. I agree with what she said about how important <b> African </b>culture and their intelligence should be respected in America as they have given so much to America. I very much support the community and have a very soft spot in my heart for them, especially, since I worked 20 years with Afro-American kids and kids with color in the inner city-Brooklyn High Schools and a few in South Florida. These are some of the reasons besides how I love people in general, why I am so proud to do paintings and collage reflecting my experience knowing them . Additionally, they have influenced my taste in music and fashion as well as have, on average, accepted me so many times as a teacher, mentor, neighbor, and, or friend, while I, on-goingly learn how very fair and highly, social they are.....and,  that we have a strong commonality being such social and outgoing people,  as I have learned I am sinceegen though I am a third generation American,  I am from a Syrian/Romanian background. And, my ancestors, too, were slaves, so I feel deeply for them.",

In her time there were battle rappers like LL Cool J, and there were party rappers Rob Base, but then there were also the conscious rappers like Public Enemy, and Rakim. They were all equally known.\u00a0\n\nNowadays, nearly all rappers rap about money, cars, and <b> sex,</b> and if you're not talking about those things there's a good chance people have never heard of you. The only rapper that stands out as unique in my mind today is Kendrick Lamar. No disrespect to anyone else, I just can't think of any other rapper who isn't about the flash, and yet has obtained a heightened level of notoriety.",

She mentioned inequality in pay and asked the question, \"What is the problem?\". The answer to that would be society. Unfortunately, we live in a world that is  highly male-favoring and not very \"female-friendly\", that's been a reality for quite some time. In other words, people, whether they realize it or not, tend to have a negative attitude towards women and a more favorable attitude towards men. What women and girls need more than anything is self-acceptance, if we can get to the point to where we accept our female selves and don't feel the need to measure up to the fellas then perhaps things will start to become better for us. There's a need for a better attitude towards women or just accepting women as they are and what they're known for doing or liking to do, that's where it starts. I would also say that there's a need for our own culture (and lingo) because believe it or not that happens to be something women are lacking in, as we would since we've basically been \"invisible\" in a world that favors men. When you really think about it, it's enough to make you mad, but I suppose all you can really do is fight your best fight, even if you don't fight too good, lmao! Bye! \ud83d\udc4b",

It would therefore kinda be the other way around when you think about it, but don't think too hard, it shouldn't be that complicated, lmao! Bye!",

They were lyricists who were not afraid to express things that would get airplay on mainstream radio but with much dignity. Nowadays rappers just don't say anything meaningful except a bunch of curse words which tear down all that Rap creators built up. Not against the new generation, but wish they would challenge themselves more and be more creative. Stop being afraid to be different and think 10 years into the future about what you are putting in the air. I can still play rap music from Queen Latifah, Sugarhill Gang, Beastie Boys, etc and still get that bobbing and weaving vibe effect just like I did when I heard them for the first time. They grooved all over a lot of my favorite singers records especially James Brown, the GODFATHER of SOUL. They really listened to the music, not just the beat of a lot of artists and they used what was around them in society and made creation in the time period for that generation and those that followed. Rappers took the ground work of Grandmaster Flash, Kurtis Blow and others and ran with it.I know that the rap game has stages, but no one is reinventing the ground work that 2 Pac, Biggie, Snoop, Nas, Digable Planets, Rakim, and many many others left on the table.",

I dont know what \"GOD\" you serve, but if its one who thinks filming 14 year olds screwing R Kelly with dildos in HIS ass and him peeing on them is \"useful\" to God, you have lost your mind. You need to take \"I believe I can fly\" off repeat and go find a real Church. He got you good. Lawd help our sister. R Kelly lets the DEVIL use him, because he LIKES IT and if you keep this up you're going to end up sipping on pee instead of grape juice at communion sis. Ya'll see this? This is proof of how R Kelly controls women, Karen wilding yo, and haven't been peed on yet. Imagine if R Kelly had Karen for a week? She would swear he wa<b> s Blac</b>k Jesus.

Cardi B, Kodak and Tekashi 69 will never get the lyrical respect from the hip hop heads from 70s, 80s, and early/mid 90s because their lyrics are too rudimentary and have no real substance however we respect the grind of these younger entertainers. Yes, entertainers like Cardi are marketable because they are beautiful, crossover between two minority groups and 3 cultural groups. Its undeniable she's very open and charismatic. She does not come off as having a manufactured personality in which people gravitate to real. But I will not call her a rapper. She's a person who raps but isnt a rapper. Just as I can change a tire and change my oil, I would never call my self a mechanic. Just because you do, dont always mean you are.",

But the truth is, there are still extraordinary people in the public light fighting for the cause they believe in through their work of art, in my opinion serves as true role model for ethics, equality, and beliefs. And Queen Latifah in this interview really represent the real Queen presence in my heart! Rosing from misogynistic music culture, evolving to different platforms carrying the same beliefs on <b> gender </b>and racial quality, ethical values, and giving back to community, now almost 3 decades. I think this is just a much better representation of role model for females or minority background or just everyone in general! And Yes! raising  awareness on<b>  mental</b> health issue is so important in our society today! You go Queen!",

My thing is I separate the music from the person in all entertainers lives past entertainers like Marvin Gaye as well as R.Kelly. And all the other entertainers who has done some fucked up shit. I don't get that deep rooted into <b> nobody </b>personal life that will stop me from listening to a song I may like. So<b>  nobody</b> that's around me no not to tell me who or what to listen to. And just to make it clear I don't care if R.Kelly nasty ass rot in hell and go to jail for the rest of his life. Ha<b> s nothin</b>g to do with me. It's funny to me how some people judge others when they have demons. Queen, isn't s<b> he <b> g</b</b>>ay. To me a lot of people have accepted that and still there is a lot of people that haven't accepted that lifestyle, I don't think that people who don't agree with that lifestyle, should not support a movie or a song because someon<b> e i<b> s</b</b>> gay. For me and my husband I really don't care what none of them do, that's their personal lives. I don't care what no entertainer do as long as it doesn't affect my life. Oh yes I do have a 2<b> 5 ye</b>ar old daughter who I have raised her to be strong minded so she wouldn't fall for any<b> thing </b>a nigga especia<b> lly </b>some old ass man like R.Kelly, she is a RN making great money and engaged to a dentist. So we are proud to know we raised her right. These parents needed to do better in raising their daughters. My daughter wouldn't have never been around R.kelly or no other older man without my husband putting a gun to that man head. So R.Kelly will get his day in jail. But I will still rock one of my favorite songs by him until the day I die. People claiming they won't listen to R.Kelly music, but behind closed doors they will be, lol including Queen who claims she stop listening to his music since that tape, yeah right. When they were playing his music on the radio, people didn't turn no stations. I don't like a lot of his songs but maybe 12 play album, and 1or 2 songs off chocolate factory, but ima keep it 100, I'm not sneak and listen to his music like a lot of people are going to be doing, I'm go listen to it when I feel like it and when I feel like it.",
