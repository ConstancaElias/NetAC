When the KKK killed thousands of<b>  Black</b> People while swank to hold Christian morality, we did not asked them to remove their robed, we do not call all Christians bigots.\u00a0\nDo you see it? How we don't label all white men based on the sins of the few?\nDo you see it? How we don't have to condemn a whole class of people based on the actions of the some.\u00a0\nDo you see it? How all the names are different, all the faces are different, how all the people are different, therefore we should not condemn all the Muslims for the radicalism of the group.\u00a0\nIf you want to persecute ISIS go ahead, but to persecute ISIS is to persecute those who gave them power, to persecute those who gave them power is to prosecute the US Government.\u00a0\nDo your research, Islam is not synonymous with terror, its literally submission, it is devotion, it is peace and terrorism actually is forbidden and Jihad does not mean Holy war, it means struggle, it means survival, it means standing face-to-face with everything that wants to put you on the ground and choosing to be alive.\u00a0\nDo your research, stop listening to CNN, stop sharing humanity for hypocrisy, stop staring at Muslims at the airport, stop letting your fear drive your ignorance, stop supporting Billionaire Republicans who wants to scare you to murder innocents and stop supporting leaders who speak peace in native tongue.\u00a0\nIts not the burning down the mosque, burn down the walls around the post muscles in your chest, and realise that we all have one and lastly as a customary greeting goes.\u00a0\nAs'salaamualaikum - Peace be upon you\u00a0\nWaliakum As'salaam \u2018 - and upon you be peace\u00a0\nDo you see it?",

You are trying to decline this but unintentionally proving vice versa. Yes environment has a major impact on \"certain ethnicities\", in other words they have advantage on their own soil (where they were born and and raised and where their ancestors lived). Also we aren't equal either whether it is genetically, intellectually or phenotypically. Every <b> race </b>has its own pros and cons, and every<b>  race</b> has advantage on their own soil. Forcing them to interbreed just worsens everything.",

They don't care about us at all and the sooner we see through the lies the sooner we can fix this mess they made for all of us.",

The barber shop reaction was much better but again that coulda been to do with not wanting to harm the business, but the best comments came from the customers there anyway so yeah I'd say much better reaction. I think for the most part people were probably more confused that someone was voicing prejudices out loud in a place where it's normally just joked or spoken about casually between friends than offended and also both geezers were kicking off it could've been totally unrelated t<b> o rac</b>e and people would've got up and split it up the same. quite funny way to end it though",

In all cases the majority-religion working class stepped up in defence of the victim, and especially when the victim was in an establishment owned by a majority-religion member. It's nice to see that that happens all over the world in all communities. Although one poster here hinted that reactions might have been different in the US, I think that might be rare even in the deep south.",

That you're far more likely to see some <b> racism </b>in liberal areas (New York City, Boston, Chicago ie) that have the most mix of races living side by side. It isn't to the extent in this video. Mostly jokey little comments behind each other's back. And in the places way out. I've never seen it in person, nor have I really heard anything. The stuff you're seeing are tiny little isolated incidents, that the media paints it up to look like a crisis.\n\nIf I took everything I learned about England from videos I would think you're mostly pedophiles, And nit wits.

My take on the whole thing is blacks have been punishing whites in america for nearly a century. They live on the system, create violence, and just make America worse. The United States bringing blacks over in slavery was the worst thing ever. Now we have violence, unemployment, and have to listen to ignorance. I am not speaking abou<b> t racis</b>m I'm speaking facts. Look at the Africa nations where the country is ran by blacks they kill each other in genocides, and there country is a fourth world country. You look at prodominet<b> ly bla</b>ck neighborhoods in America and you kill viole<b> nce bl</b>ac<b> k on b</b>lack violence poverty and a horrible community. Anytime there is a white community the violence is next to none, the education  level is high and the property values are high.<b>  Then </b>black people move into the neighborhood and the price of real estate plummet. Its no a coincidence. I<b> ts sad</b> black people one day need to stop  thin<b> k eve</b>ry race white,Latino,Asian,                   and so on want to avoid liv<b> ing in</b> a black neighborhood they continue to move away from the city and branch out into white communities. The schools are another example white schools education level very high,violence very low,and a group togetherness v<b> ery hi</b>gh. Black schools education low,violence high, and violence against one another very high. I personally don't no why its like this but I would love to see a change one way or another. A<b> nd for</b> the black activists spewing stuff saying they are still owed for there great great great grandparents. Do some research you will find slaves owners were obviously deep south and there were less than 00.1percent of the south. Many white families come from immigrants who at the time of slavery were not in this country. Me for example both grandparents came from Germany so I do not have any family that were in the United States during slavery. And that's goes for the majority of Americans. You also have northern people who died in the civil war to help free the slaves. But the<b>  only </b>thing black people say is they want reperations. I have one thing the United States can<b>  offer</b>. If a black person traces there family tree and there family were slaves they should be offered a, plane ticket to Africa and the US can work out where they would get instant citizenship . they would get a plane ticket,citizenship, and a small amount of money as a start up.once that person leaves there citizenship to the United States becomes null in void. I like my p<b> lan. I </b>am not racist I looked up the statistics before I wrote this its literally the facts.",

I'm not a <b> racist </b>at all but I think it's hypocritical that BLM wants to argue about oppression when that is happening to their brothers and sisters elsewhere, they deserve to be free like us and you never know what the world is missing from some of these people that could do something to change the world for the better",

This video is only uploaded to entertain and that's sad. People continue to make these so called \" social experiment videos o<b> f racis</b>m only to entertain viewers. People continue to spread the white <b> vs bla</b>ck idea and it's only making things worst. Yes there are s<b> ome rac</b>ist people still out there but the media continues to influence and brain wash people by saying whites hate blacks.Its like when you finally leave and forget your ex and someone continues to mention your ex to you. Like, I'm trying to forget! One way to stop people's perception of blacks is by investing in their education and schools. That will reduce drop outs and increase success. Also lower stereotypes. This video is pointless. Just another form of entertainment.",

I didn't think about that as I saw the video as something positive in the end but by keep pointing out \u2018white vs blacks' everywhere - no matter the agenda of the video/article - positive or negative - it is still perpetuating the segregation! And Im a firm believer that this is the wrong way to go! I wouldn't want to be segregated From other colours of people or cultures or races etc... I live in a predominantly Asian (<b> Indian,</b> Pakistani etc) neighbourhood and I'm white! I moved here because I mainly love the food of this culture/race ( or whatever term you would like to use ) of people and the activity on the streets - shops open later - families socialising out later in restaurants due to cultural background etc. I would be bored out of my mind in an all white neighbourhood - couldn't think of anything worse! .... and I can't actually think of an all white neighbourhood where I live :) thank goodness!!!

Talk about a beautiful mix. I got along well with her family, and she got along well with mine.\nWe seemed to get the most hate from the older generations, and (surprisingly for me, but not her) many younge<b> r Africa</b>n American men also showed their distaste for our relationship.\nIt just bothers me so deeply when I see people seek to destroy any positive light shone towards Caucasian people because of their own unfortunate experiences.\nThis is the culture that raised me to love everyone equally regardless of their skin color - has it had its hiccups in the past? Yes, but so has eve<b> ry ra</b>ce, and demonizing us isn't the answer, as we know that there's good in our culture just as there is bad.\nWe've all experienced it, even if you (the reader; not you personally Shane) refuse to call<b>  it rac</b>ism, then it's still heavy prejudice, and that's still very wrong.\n\nTo quote the movie Contact in regard to Humanity:\n\"You're an interesting species. An interesting mix. You're capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares. You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone, only you're not. See, in all our searching, the only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other.\"",

Too bad its still your predicament. I don't think slavery is right or just in any way, just to unite blacks everywhere over complaining where they suffered more oppression. I give it to the UK, since everyone is still complaining over the terribly crowded poor areas spreading over most of your land like the plague.

Have you ever sat down and had a conversation and gotten to know an arab in america? I bet my life you havent. I am arab myself, and i believe in peace love and positivity. Almost every other arab in my life was raised this way and that is what we believe. Remember in school when one or two kids in the class would get in trouble, yet the whole class gets punished? thats how we feel. The media doesnt tell you that islam is a peaceful religion, and that muslim extremists (notice how i said EXTREMISTS) are a TINY TINY percent of muslims. And dont act like there arent christian extremists either. How many times have you also heard of a christian man shooting a <b> black </b>man or a<b>  ga<b> y</b</b>> man <b> or wom</b>an? that is the same thing, it also happens but it doesnt represent the whole culture. It is only the extremists.",

Surely, if he had tge proper skills and qualifications he will be the first to get the job because he's fluent in English.

The only difference you could perhaps draw upon is that this particular group of <b> black </b>people were slightly more vocal in their defence of the victim than that particular group of white people - but you could just as well put this down to the fact that they were mostly all staff at the barber shop and therefore knew each other, as opposed to strangers in a bar.

Every <b> race </b>has suffered slavery. 3rd class people in the colonies and early US were slaves including white people. This consisted of the Irish, Dutch, Germans, Greeks, Italians, ect. The only difference is, we later called them indentured servants because the government feeds off of civil unrest. It's like a smoke grenade to hide what they want to do next. They save civil unrest for the major things because everyone is too pissed off at each other to think about why they feel this way.",

Detach yourself from the past of which you are no longer a part, embrace the present, live for today, work for tomorrow.

It must be said though, Muslim isn't a <b> race,</b> it's a belief system of which you have chosen to believe in or more commonly raised to ''choose''. I will always respect you though, so long as you respect everybody who doesn't believe and their right to challenge the things you regard to be truth. For example if somebody were to say to you ''If the things Muslims believed could be proven as indisputable facts, pretty sure we'd all be Muslim right now and youtube wouldn't exist, let alone the internet.'' it would be an accepted challenge, rather than a reason to pull out the<b>  race</b> card right?",

Remember that when you do, just how many fingers are pointed back at you. You don't want to SOLVE the problem, you are PROPAGATING it. YOU behave with a divisive mindset, an \"us\" vs. \"them\" mindset, and you'll have this division in people. I personally can't stand people being<b>  racist</b> and being unable to see past color - ALL color. \"Multiculturalism\" is a politically correct term for people who are too afraid to call the problem what it is: HATE. FEAR. DIVISION. Don't even GO there. \n\nSo the next time you want to blame all white people for your problems, or say they're the only one<b> s racis</b>t, make sure you look at the whole picture. For now, I'm blocking your ass because I'm not going to sit here and have a debate with someone who's OBVIOUSLY wanting a fight, and a chance to bring somebody else down and tear down their views! Maybe you should consider what you're REALLY angry at!",

I am disappointed the Irish pub owners did not defend the guy who was clearly being abused and the 'offender' was just asked to step outside to vent. (The Irish should understand discrimination! )They just wanted to avoid trouble for themselves, and should have responded the <b> black </b>guys question of his being  welcome . The kind ('non English) barmaid understood, and called it,  but was ignored. \nThe barber stuff was just childish baiting,  the guy was just spouting crap and just trying to agitate foolishly. Of course the guy was a stooge, but he was not even making any comprehensive racial point. Generally the majority  of the barber shop guys were more unnerved and sensitive than the first 'story' in the pub.  The last part was just ridiculous and embarrassing for everyone, that was childish. Most<b>  racism</b> is more subtle and difficult to reveal unfortunately. Trollstation fail.What was the test? Literally so you not have anything better to do?",

US had been multi-cultural for since pretty much the begining, but UK found inself basically invaded by immigrants, and all happened in just the last 50-40 years. From Africans to Muslims, from Asians to East Europeans, UK is full of immigrants. While immigrants come up from everywhere they lost all their colonies. They have their own economical problems, and yet imaigrants continue to come, take jobs and walfare... you can't expect them be welcoming at infinite. They had been welcoming for a long time, but at this point things got out of control really bad, and is not only UK, most of the Europe is in this situation. A big enaf problem, that native Europeans feel in danger.",

Most of the ones you presented are simply<b>  racist</b> stereotypes, oppinions that non-white from non-white regions have about the ''tyranical and deadly white person'' and they are simply ridiculous:\u00a0 pedofilia for example is in West is ilegal, yet in many of those cultures of non-whites, child marriage is a comon thing - so we talk about hyposcrsy. On the other hand, I can understand where th<b> e racis</b>t one comes from, looking at our not so far away history.\n\u00a0The thing is, that you can't can't really put sterotypes on whites, like you put them and Afro-Americans or Mexicans... I mean a Afro-American from Washington, and a AA from Los Angeles or Texas is pretty much the same thing, they are similar... while when it comes too white peoples Americans and Europeans are quite different from each other... And in Europe, there is variety too. So the steretypes unsually need to have a direct target: the way in which the American and Frech see the world is different, even trough they are both white.\n\u00a0A good white sterotype? Well, regarding White Americans: Shitty Tourist's. While there are decent american tourists, there are some relly bad ones that made americans notorious in Europe. Another one can be regarding the rampant obesity. Other example: Germans - hard working; obviously there are lazy peoples in Germany too, but is comonly accepted, that Germans are extremly hard working peoples... is true, but is a stereotype. On the other hand we have Greeks, which are well know as: extremly lazy peoples. Again, is a stereotype, and there are hard working Greeks, but is also true that many of them are extremly lazy and ignorant, that why they are in their actual situation.",

Or GOD=YHWH, Jesus will press you even lower than any others. Depending a body is evil. Good is only to dedicate to GOD=Jesus yourselves.\n\nAryans had lived to far east Asia. Mongol and Manjuria, Uygur, China, Korean peninsula from bronze <b> age.</b> But there are no pure Aryans. Because their blood mixed with northern Asians. But northern Asians are the descendants of the southern Asians as a result of DNA researches. And southern Asians had come from east Africans.\n\nSo our northern Asians can't boast ourselves. but you too.\n\nEuropeans were<b>  sex</b> slaves for Mongolians for about 2 thousands years according to China and Mongol historic writings and ancient paintings.\n\nOnce Aryan fighters had attacked east asian people up to centrel china and centrel Mongol deeply, soon China and Mongolia defeated them and made Aryans as thei<b> r se</b>x slaves. Because they seemed Aryans beautiful. So Mongolians have hunt Aryans for making their wives after meeting Aryans for thousands years.\n\nThis pattern had been repeating since Yin dynasty of China in ancient history books. I read the same pattern contents repeatedly so boared many times. Because this pattern appeared many times in east history.\n\nScythians had been the strongest fighters in the west. But they became weak people and nations in the east which had dedicated women and gold, silver to Mongolians after losing the many wars with Mongolia and China. Northern east asians called Scythians as Sogdians and had been often taken their women and havings.\n\nAfter them Persian then Horasm then Aryan islam nations had dedicated instead of Scythians to Northern east asian nomads.\n\nEspecially when Russia was reigned under Mongolia for hundreds. Including TaTar, many Mongol tribes have changed into European's appearance different from the ancient historic writings of Greek and Rome, China. They originally were rounded faces and have very low and wide noses and very sharp and small eyes, short limbs according to Rome and China writings. You can confirm above history from Russia history.\n\nIf you see the stone cave murals and Orhon stone writings bar in the middle east which Turkeys are worshiping, You will know that Turkeys originally were not Europeans blooded but pure Asians. They are the result of blood mixing above.\n\nAs a result, even Hittler of German worshiped Northern east asian nomad knights.\n\nDo not boast your bodies. Or GOD=YHWH, Jesus will press you even lower than any others. Aryans, the sons of Japheth are Gog and Magog used to attack Israelites by Satan in the Bible. Be careful not to become the slaves of Satan.",

Americans are all about progression and solving this problem, though some may act in counterproductive ways. I don't think you need your ass beat even though you're promoting the same kind of hate, you've just never been told any different.

Do you think someone who sits in prison for the rest of their life, or at least a portion of it doesn't think they made a mistake, while the people who love them and the people they love struggle to cope with their problems on the outside where they can't help? It seems all of the people who've disagreed with me have trouble understanding that they don't understand, and won't, but still continue to think they're the only ones with the right answer.",

Mass immigration and a ton of speech/behaviour laws since the 1990s have meant that it was inevitable eventually that the races would get along. I think there has been a tipping point in the UK's social progression in recent years also.\n\n- In the past four years, violent crime has fallen by 30% (Crime Survey, more reliable than police recorded figures)\n- Teenage pregnancy is the lowest since the 2nd world war.\n- The number of people in Young Offenders Institutes has fallen by 55% between 2010-2014.\n- The homicide rate has fallen by 48% between 2004-2014.\n\nThese are big social changes in a very short period of time. Perhaps in a few decades time, people will look back and recognise this period as one of exceptional social change.",

And athletes from poor areas tend to put in the most effort into sports becuase in many cases that is the only way out of that area, with no parental guidance or influence because the family structre is broken.

These days, unless the establishment is owned and populated by the NF, any random group of white people would react as they did in the pub. The simple truth is that there are some white people who have an issue with skin colour, and the same goes for some <b> black </b>people.\nYears ago, we moved into an area of east London. I was warned by an<b>  elderly</b> white resident that, for whites,\u00a0it wasn't safe to go outside in the evening. The first evening I went to the corner shop a gang o<b> f blac</b>k\u00a0guys followed\u00a0us\u00a0in and threatened us for being in their area. On another occasion, I was beaten almost to death by a mixed asi<b> an-bla</b>ck gang for being white in the wrong place. Some time ago<b> , a bl</b>ack guy actually suggested I deserved it because they must have sensed my inhe<b> rent ra</b>cism! No, I was jumped as I quietly made my way home from work. They didn't know anything about me, other than I was wh<b> ite. \"R</b>acism\" cuts both ways. I had several more enlig<b> htened</b> black friends when I lived there but there are still some blacks and some whites stupid enough to focus on skin colour.\nTh<b> e word </b>\"racist\" is often misused though. These days, it is persistently\u00a0used against people who dare question our insane immigration policy and the consequent burden on UK services.",

Poland, England, Russia, France, USA, all primarily christian.\n\n\nAlso, just out of curiosity, what kind of injustice do you think Muslims in particular faced during ww1 and ww2? I mean.. The Jews heavily suffered, Christians even more so. Muslims? Come on... \n\n\nThe Holy Crusades. Ok. Do you see how silly it is, that you're bringing something up that happened that many years ago, to try and tear down Christianity? \u00a0\n\n\nPersonally I couldn't give a shit, as I'm atheist myself, and believe all religions to be closer related to a theoretical hell, than any heaven.\n\n\nThat said, if you truly want to educate yourself, and trust me, you should want to; then I suggest you check out the link I put here earlier. Also consider this: When did the middle-east last have peace? Because I CAN understand that you think the western world has been meddling too much in recent times (Russians and Americans in Afganistan and Irak, e.g.), but I cannot understand, if you blame us for the last 500 years of power struggles, as all middle-eastern countries have had conflicts on/off since the middle ages, with no outside involvement.",

No, white people living in South Africa can't be <b> racist </b>towards Africans. You'd be right. Because the area is predominantly<b>  African</b>. You can't oppress a majority, you can't oppress an oppressor and you definitely can't oppress a majority group who's (arguably) still an oppressor in your country.

                    "commentText": "+joey clay It's about viewing <b> racism </b>as an institution instead of an action. What you described is racial discrimination. Any time a person treats someone badly or unfairly solely because of skin color, that is racial discrimination. <b> \"Racism</b>\" is the encompassment of the idea of all these discriminative acts causing a group with significantly less power or control, oppression. Anybody, anywhere can be racially discriminative to anyone. But in order to say a person is encompassing<b>  \"racis</b>m\" or bein<b> g \"raci</b>st\", they would have to have the ability to oppress someone with their actions and to essentially add to the overall problem/growing problem of oppression against the group that person falls under.\n\nIn short, calling a shop owner<b>  a \"rac</b>ist\" for not allowing Asians in his shop means you are saying that shop owner is fueling the pool of oppression against Asains that already exists. However, if for example an Asian shop owner living in America doesn't allow whites in his shop, that act may be racially discriminative but it is<b> n't \"ra</b>cist\" because that man will never have the ability to add to an oppression pool against whites in America. Because white people in America have privilege. All presidents until recent have been white, whites are still the most featured in TV ads, and there hasn't even been racial equality in the country for more even 60 years yet. White people still hold privilege in the country so there is no pool of oppression for them. And that's why society doesn't treat white discrimination as an \"active problem\" in America. \nThere are thousands of cultural studies courses that will teach you the same thing. The definiti<b> on of r</b>acism has immensely evolved over time and it's never going to be as simple as the dictionary definitions everyone wants to use. I'm not making this stuff up.",

            "commentText": "Here is smthng to ponder:\u00a0\nFrankly, skin color is not significant, skin color gives no meaning at all to a person's character. What gives a person meaning is his belief, culture, upbringing and his society.\n\nA human is a tool that things can be downloaded into, like a sponge. For instance you have the <b> Black </b>American and the Africans who have totally different cultures,<b>  black</b> americans listen to rap and have that thug mentality, while Africans have a culture that is totally different with no thug metality, no rap music.\u00a0\n\nYou have white Amercans, who believe that anything with skin color is inferior, and they oppress anyone with skin color. This is their belief, a while ago they believed that slavery was right and later segregation was the trend and all that belief changed overtime, and you have white people now believing in human rights, that all men are created equal with a few still adhering to the past believe that nullifies the present belief.\u00a0\n\nYou have the justice system condoning terrorism o<b> f blac</b>k men, shooting unarm<b> ed bla</b>ck men who pose no threat who may still be uprehended in another way. These are what form a person, it could be wrong belief, but eventually the whole society adopts this belief and it becomes the norm.\u00a0\n\nBut if you look under the skin of any human, there is no difference. Thus the skin does not have a value in making a persons nature, what has value is what goes into your brain and heart. The Bible said, guard your heart with all diligence for from it flows the very life.\n\nBut back to the meaning of this writing, if God created all human in his own image, and gave them different skin color, then skin color is not the value of being human. We know that God became human to redeem us from sin, he became Jesus Christ.\n\nSo why did he not choose to become white,<b>  or bl</b>ack because there is no importance in skin color. It is not about skin color people. Beneath our shell is a spirit, meaning the real you is a colorless being, a spirit. It is this world that made everything become confusing.\n\nAgain it is not skin color that determins your final resting place heaven or hell, but it all boils down to your belief and behavior. The Bible said that he had feet like bronze, yet while we know that God is a spirit, and he became Jesus, and even when the Holy Spirit showed up in the form of a Dove, when Jesus was being baptized.\u00a0\n\nThen you can deduce that it is not about appearance that God cares about, since his Spirit can take a form of a Dove, then that means that a body is just a place where the spirit lives, it is the car or vehicle we get by.",

While many brits try to to make a damn pound up in the north Lets start of with the fact that northern England\u00a0 is broke and dosent have any money . and are heavily underdeveloped . And lets do a history trip.\u00a0\u00a0 britian was a <b> nation </b>that depend on its empire but it declared war on Germany and after ww2 it was broke Its empire that it depend on fell to the ground .\u00a0 BBEcause of this britians poverty rate sky rocketed . britian had to recovery. And guess who had to save there asses ?? Oh yes united states of america\u00a0 it had to give britian hordes of loans. and had to trade heavily with there<b>  old</b> enemy Germany lol. speak about standards .\u00a0 OH!! I forgot\u00a0 another delicious part aNd because of this you brits got your first 21 century nick name wells there's two actually. but getting to the point Because of britians failure economically they had to bend over to the rich they had to cater over to the millionaires and billionaires and also depend on them to survive. and Guess WHAT!! it actually worked for a while .\u00a0 But the down side was now they were the bitch of not just america now but the wealthy . Sadly thought this didn't do as much as they thought it would because many parts of britian\u00a0 was poor cough cough northern England\u00a0 Also You know\u00a0 i have to say this do you know your empire is considered the bloodstained monarchy in AAsia because you know you starved and slaughtered millions more then the holocaust :):). so now we can also look at present day England were you<b> r natio</b>n is broke and is suffering Do you how many of English people depend on tourism to survive DO YOU\u00a0 lets just say a lot of your population wont be doing good once winter comes:) also lets not\u00a0 forget many of your population literally only have benefit money :) You see look i doNt hate England but when i see a comment like youRs and\u00a0 other it really makes me laugh because you talk about america Like shit yet. america had to give you hordes a of money with out that England would be the poore<b> st nati</b>on\u00a0 in Europe also\u00a0 you talk about how america shit ..... Dude America economy is rising and the homeless population is going down and americas programs to makes less Peo<b> ple </b>fat are actually working while England is getting poor and remember poor leads to cheap food and cheap food's leads to b<b> eing</b> fat so the\u00a0 En<b> glis</b>h fat rate is going to go Big :) also letS be honest you guys had what like two riots in the last 7 years in your capital like come on get your shit together . dont talk about nations like america because it makes you look ignorant and jealous . Come on be grateful a nations actually cad ABout\u00a0 your well being and gav<b> e your </b>nation money food in supplies you know in Germany we had to become wealthy on are owns we didn't get the mass help you got from america\u00a0\u00a0 so be happy . and appreciate it\u00a0 that's all i want .

Genocide is <b> Nazi </b>Germany shit, genocide is Belgium whipping up hatred in Rwanda then stepping back, You seem to be confusing immigration with genocide, and deliberately so.\u00a0\n\nIt sounds more like your concern is that when people of different colours live together, they get together, have<b>  sex</b> and have mixed babies. It sounds like that's your fear. That your colour won't exist anymore. Which is a ridiculous thing to fear for, especially when you consider that white people came fro<b> m blac</b>k people, when they moved to colder climes.\n\n If you only want to ha<b> ve s</b>ex with people of the same colour as you, that's your choice, however genes work best when they are as varied and mixed as possible, hence the problems that come from inbreeding, but whatever, keep on with your need for \"purity\" if you wish, see where it gets you.\n\nOr maybe I'm giving you too much credit and you're jus<b> t a rac</b>ist troll who wants to watch the word burn, it's hard to tell from your comment.",

Also, when they both left, a white male bystander began to laugh while looking at another, so they were CLEARLY not taking it seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, in the barber shop, the majority were arguing back, encouraging the white male to stay, yelling back at th<b> e blac</b>k guy.

            "commentText": "Yesterday I had a job interview. I was asked how should I \"politically correct\" call a person \"with <b> black </b>skin color\". I responded to that \"human\". The sad thing is that: a) still in 2014 people ask that kind of questions; b) Only I answered like that (other people said <b> \"african</b>\"), and they told me, that I was like 50th person applying for the job... We are all humans, doesn't matter that someone has different skin color, or professes a different religion... Everyone has the right to be free, and is different than others in some way, that's why people are awesome, because everyone is different in one way or another, but you have to think that we are all humans... Look at South Park season 4 episode 8...",

Funny thing is, these observations you talk of were all made by non-black, non-chinese or any other <b> race </b>but the white men<b>  race</b>, the sam<b> e rac</b>e that just some years ago said women had low IQ, the sa<b> me ra</b>ce which had more embracing something so stupid and evil at the same time called 'slavery' than being against it, SMH you people always need something to put beneath you and you want me to believe these so called observations? Lol I would really have to be stupid to.\n\nNow, if you truly believe such nonsense, such crap like how we have low IQ's then you know jack ab<b> out Afri</b>can history... read about Mansa Musa the Mali Empire, The Ghana Empire, The Songhai Empire.\u00a0\nYou (White men in general) say you were the first to go to America even though Columbus admitted to meeting travellers from Africa, but you don't learn that in school. You sit on your assess learning that you created so many things while in truth you are just leaches stealing the inventions of others and saying it's yours. You burned down so many museums, libraries (Timbuktu), destroyed everything that contradicts your lies.\nEveryone that reads inde<b> bted Afr</b>ican history, Arab history, Chinese history would realize why so many people of other races see you as The Devil, even the bible said you were the children of fallen angels. You were thrown out of Africa because of your albinism, and now you have revenge by putting up puppet politicians and getting cheap access to natural resources, you got rich from the hard work of Africans, Arabs, and the Chinese. You don't need a high IQ to realize how evil you are. You keep on doing shit to everyone behind the scenes, then plaster on the TV how you 'heroes' helping the poor, there is no doubt that the Anti-Christ will be a White Devil.",

The War was first fought by the Union in order to preserve the alliance of states and turn them into a single <b> nation.</b>\u00a0\nThen, when the South was doing too well, Lincoln proclaimed the slaves free. The purpose of this was twofold: extra soldiers, which the Union sorely needed; and the moral high ground, which the Union needed more than anything else.\n\nMeanwhile, the Confederacy (and even the blacks of the Confederacy who volunteered against the Union) maintained the same position: Freedom.\u00a0\n\nWhich means that the \"bloodiest war in American history\" was a farce, and that, given the social clime of the times, slavery would have been abolished without bloodshed as it was everywhere else in a matter of a decade.",

That's up you but it's a fairly superficial reason to like or dislike someone.\n\nThis country has benefited enormously from immigration, but you are entitled to your opinion and don't have to like other people, that's your right.\n\nThe United Kingdom is part of \u00a0a commonwealth of countries based on the<b>  old</b> British Empire. If you want, maybe stand for parliament and make your platform that you want the UK to pull out of the commonwealth.\n\nAnd of course when you do, \u00a0petition the monarchy to return all those jewels to the countries they were taken from. And be sure to get the British museum to return all the dead bodies stolen from Egyptian tombs which are now on display for public viewing.\n\nYou've got to give respect to get respect, but when people act superior to others they are only living out a fantasy of their own making.",

I've not accused you of anything yet you've not only tried to label me a moron but also anti-white. I made an observation based on your comment.\n\nRemember this, the people who throw insults around are the ones who know their argument holds no water.\n\nI repeat, if it's only white people you would like to welcome into the country in which you live, then your issue with immigration has <b> nothing </b>to do with numbers coming in or with their religion or views, just the colour of their skin, and just so you know it's not being European that's made the skin white it's a lack of melanin from being in less sunny climes for a very very long time. very simple science.\n\n\n\"Whatever. Have your stupid jewels or mummies or whatever else. I don't value that stuff..\"\n\nStupid mummies? They are human remains that are on display in the nations premier museum, they were buried and dug up by grave robbers and still in 2015 they are on display. Is that the behavior of a modern civilized<b>  nation</b>?\n\nNeither these or any of the crown jewels are mine, I lay no claim to any of them, I merely point out that this country doesn't have clean hands in this world, but then who does? Now immigration isn't an attack or punishment it's just a fact of life.\n\nWe can ether work together for the betterment of all of us or we can try to drag each other down, but then isn't life tough enough already without trying to make enemies of people who are not against you?\n\nSo again, you are welcome to your views, they are your concern and yours only.\n\nGoodbye and good luck to you.",

So the two of you really should stop lying. \u00a0Re-read all of this thread if you need to, So far the two of you have both used the word moron as an attempt to insult, you've not answered a single point put to you and you've claimed I'm anti-white an<b> d racis</b>t when I've done and sa<b> id nothi</b>ng to indicate that.\n\nAnd who is exactly is \"they\" by the way? I'm me, I challenged Brian on his views and told him he was ignorant then you took it upon yourself to jump \u00a0in and have so far not contributed to the conversation have you.\n\nYou don't want non-whites in the same country as you, and Brian throws slurs around like they are going out of fashion, sp is that behaviour that indica<b> tes rac</b>ist views or not? See, that's a question, you do know the difference between a question and an accusation, or condemnation right?\n\nSomeone asks you to qualify your comments and instead you call <b> them ra</b>cist?\n\nThat makes no sense, unless your goal is not to see the truth of how valueless your continued ideas of separation are.\n\nNow I'd said goodbye and good luck to you in my previous reply to you as it seemed the conversation between us was over but instead you've both chosen to start talking about me as if I'm not here, which is incredibly rude. I don't know who brought the pair of you up but you could each do with learning some manners and learning how to treat others.\n\nNone of this is a condemnation, it is merely a suggestion based on observation. If anything that has come u in this short exchange is in any way uncomfortable for you then you may want to dig a little deeper within yourself and ask yourself, \"Is what I'm thinking right now really true? Is it in my own best interests or is it based in fear and all the faces that fear takes, i.e. condemnation, accusation, and claims of victimisation where there is none.<b> \n\nNow no</b>thing either of you have done or written is \"wrong\", you may want to question it's usefulness to you.\n\nYou are free to believe whatever you want, even if it is \u00a0untrue, even if it is less than useful to you, even if it helps you to feel miserable and spread misery to others.\n\nMy part in this conversation is done, feel free to look through any of this for an untruth to pick apart. Feel free to talk among yourselves because I will no longer be looking at any reply you may come up with as none have been worth my time and attention yet.\n\nI hope you both find true peace and happiness in this life and start sharing that instead of your fearful ideas.",

You need to understand there are more ridiculous sins that can be punished by death in other religions such as Judaism and Christianity so why should Islam be penalized only?\n\nNo, I didn't blame Christians for slavery. I said Christians were INVOLVED IN THE SLAVE TRADE. I did not blame anyone. That, in Islam, is forbidden. To think highly of yourself or to be arrogant and judge is something that is frowned upon in Islam and equality is deeply pressed on Muslims.\n\nI am happy, masha'Allah, that you're content with your life and I pray that Allah makes your life even better. Oh and just to point out, the sentence \"I do not believe in God, Allah or anything supernatural.\" doesn't make sense because Allah is virtually God in the arabic language that's like repeating God two times. But, it is an easy mistake.\n\nNo, no it's fine! Don't apologize for those comments and I hope you feel that I tackled your \"dickyness\" well and not in anger or spite.\u00a0\n\nSalaam",

Since there is literally<b>  zero</b> evidence on that. There is same exact amount of evidence on sasquatch and that is not taught as a truth.\n\nI'm not sorry that you are a muslim but I'm sorry you didn't have chance to choose. (Assuming you were raised as a muslim.)",

Seems like someone here lives in a lala land and it's not me.\n\n\"You say there is no evidence?\" Yes I do. There is no proof of the existence of some sort of higher power. There is just some things science can not yet explain that may or may not be caused by a higher power. That doesn't justify the existence of a god.\n\nMuslim scientists were actually way ahead their time hundreds of years ago. And it doesn't take a genius to cut a fetus out of womans womb at different stages of pregnancy. People did nasty things in the name of science too.  \n\nAnd the sea thing. I don't see your point there. That is just simple chemistry and someone happened to notice that phenomenon. Like that would justify that Allah exists. \n\nAnd some scientists may have converted to islam, I believe that. Quoran has some scientifically accurate things in it. And a lot of things make sense. But again, that is very poor evidence of Allah. A vast majority once believed that earth was flat. And a lot of scientists believed that too. But it didn't make it any more true.\n\nI'm not denying that Allah doesn't exist and I can't prove it. And I can't prove that there is no pink unicorn that fires lazers orbiting the sun but is so small we can't detect it. Scientifically it is just very unlikely that there is Allah or a pink unicorn. You can't prove I dont have three legs that each has nipples that ooze chocolate milk, but do you believe it?\n\nYou're about right on that purpose thing. I really don't have a purpose for my life in a traditional meaning. My purpose is really to enjoy life: read, exercise, enjoy nature and spend time with loved ones.",

Although some people do need to know the difference between patriotism and <b> racism.</b>\n\nI'm a patriot and don't agree with the immigration rate and should remain level with the emigration level and illegals shouldn't be allowed here. Also people who immigrate unless they are a high skilled doctor or similar skills that benefit the country then they shouldn't be given a free house and benefits unless they deserve them and earned them, as many people who immigrate get payed more than people who work in offices or supermarkets. Again, I enjoyed the video and pleased with the results :)",

I hate it when people say America i<b> s fa</b>t, America is rude, America sucks, as far as I am concerned, I am fine living here and I think that America is one of the bests countries because we fight for fairness no matter h<b> ow f</b>at we are, if there was someone being attacked, I think most adults in America would punch that guy in the noggin to protect the person in need, not shy away like I have seen in other countries.",

Those are Middle Eastern issues, not European issues.\ufeff They didn't happen here, but of course someone like you would think anywhere that isn't America or Mexico is Europe.\n\nLondon is not a \"welfare state\", it is a city in England. I wouldn't expect a <b> yank </b>to know anything about welfare systems, though, as they seem to fetishise the idea of seeing even children starving to death in the street so they can save on their sweet, sweet taxes.\n\nAnd by the way, that beheading thing happened to way more than just American soldiers, but that you specifically mention Americans like they're the only ones that mattered is the sort of arrogance I expected from your lot.",

First winged apparatus(Flying) was created by a Muslim. Coffee, But most importantly. YOUTUBE. without the Muslims, Youtube wouldn't be a thing. Please, your daily hatred of \"muslims\" just stupid. All it does it enhances the hate in you. Look, I understand they're some fucked up Muslims out there. It doesn't mean the rest of the 1.8 Billion people on this planet are. All your hatred does is prevent you from looking at what good muslims do, and focus on the bad ones. Which to be fair for you. they're the only ones who get the media's attention. I wonder why.

Like taqiyah for example. I did my research on it. Taqiyah is part of the Shia doctrine, which reperesent small amount of Muslims. Even they, the shiiates say you're not allowed to lie. Only allowed when there's a gun onto your head. I do not go to fucking retarded, Muslim hating sites, nor muslim loving sites. USE YOUR BRIAN TO RESEARCH. Like for example. These verses which supposedly mean Muslims have to fight the \"infidels\" Just take the fucking time to look up a<b>  quran</b>, go to that verse, read the verse before it. you'll understand what is.

It's got <b> nothing </b>to do with your colour, it's how you act and the image you project. When I used to hang around the streets I was stopped by police almost constantly, sometimes more than once in a day. Since I grew up and started dressing differently I've had virtually no encounters with them.They seem to socially profile certain people that dress a certain way, especially if your wearing a hoody or hat. As far as the everyday person is concerned I think they're just hesitant of young people in general from all the propaganda about 'hoody culture' in the news. Doesn't mean they're<b>  racist</b>.

You haven't walked the shoes of a <b> black </b>man in America, and I can sure as hell bet you wouldn't even try. The way you see things are far too biased. Even if (clearly not true) what you say is true, don't you think there'd be a reason behind the <b> \"black</b> Americans\" being \"not patient or polite\".\u00a0\n\nSeriously Tom, you have to separate yourself from your opinions, do a lot of research on this topic (you're not an expert) and then come back and revise your beliefs. Let's say if Einstein were alive and he analysed the social issues in the US, do you think he would agree with your points?",

But we knew little of west, central, south and east africa. So there is a huge cultural barrier because of that. But we don't h<b> ate based </b>on ethnicity, but they think we hate them o<b> r that </b>we are racist. And they hate arabs, and whites..... They just assume that everyone is against them, so they become defensive and even attack! Only time we<b>  for su</b>re show racism against them is when marriage comes to question.<b> .....bu</b>t we are racist towards europeans and others too when that comes to question. So there is a very very long wa<b> y from</b> meeting a black guy on the road to marriage purposal. They just need to respect themselves more and stop being critical. Luckily, not everyone is like that...and there is a huge difference between north american and south american blacks, and the \"negroid\" blacks of Africa. The jews that lived millenias in europe are surely not the same psycologically as those who lived in more or less in peace in Isreal all along! It's luckly hard to generalize!
