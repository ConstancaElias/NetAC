        "postText": "A Catholic priest has been jailed after a man he arranged to meet in order to abuse his son, two, turned out to be an undercover police officer.', 'Father Matthew Jolley was duped by the officer he first approached on the Grindr dating app in September.', 'It took the priest less than 20 minutes to tell the undercover officer \u2013 posing as a 36-year-old bisexual man \u2013 that he was sexually interested in young children.', 'Over the course of a number of depraved chats, Jolley, 32, admitted while he mainly liked girls, a \u2018cute\u2019 boy would also be of interest, the Manchester Evening News reports.', 'After telling the police officer he wanted to \u2018do his two-year-old son\u2019 \u2013 who did not exist \u2013 the priest then sent an indecent image of himself.', 'The lurid conversation shifted from Grindr to Kik Messenger and later to Wickr \u2013 an encrypted platform for private chats.', 'In these chats, Jolley revealed his sick fantasy of \u2018sharing\u2019 the child with his dad.', 'Liverpool Crown Court heard Jolley began communicating with the officer while based in Belgium but planned to return to the UK for two weeks before travelling to Rome in October.', 'On 26 September he arranged to meet the undercover cop at a home in Halton, Cheshire.', 'When the priest arrived Jolley described what he wanted to do to the defenceless child \u2013 completely oblivious to the fact he was talking to an undercover officer.', 'When the officer revealed his true identity the priest tried to make a run for it but was tackled to the ground and arrested.', 'On Friday, Jolley from Great Sankey, Warrington, was jailed for three years and four months and placed on the sex offenders register for life after pleading guilty to arranging the commission of a child sex offence.', 'Judge recorder Jeremy Lakser condemned the actions of the priest and told him: \u2018It cannot be said it was an aberration, it was something you considered at length over a time. During that lengthy period it progressed so far as you believed almost to fruition.', '\u2018You are an ordained priest in the Catholic church.', '\u2018I do not impose a more severe sentence for that reason but it goes without saying, although I do say it, that your words and actions and intentions seem to me to be wholly inconsistent with the teachings of the Catholic church and you have done nothing but a great disservice to the church.\u2019', 'Following the sentencing, Detective Constable Louise Murphy praised the work of the task force which brought the predatory priest to justice.', 'She said: \u2018Through his online communications it was clear to see that he was sexually attracted to young children and would do whatever he could in order to fulfil his own sexual gratification.', '\u2018I would like to take this opportunity to thank the undercover law enforcement officers who have been instrumental in building the case against Jolley.', '\u2018This case shows how well agencies can work together in order to protect the most vulnerable people in society. It also sends a clear message that anyone who commits such offences are not above the law and they will be brought to justice, regardless of who they are and what they do.\u2019",

What is with this absolutely retarded justice system we have in the uk, this judge and his accomplices need the law abiding citizen treatment you know what im saying, if not, watch the film.

It didn't mean anything to them for them to act the way they do, so why would they care? Only due to lack of easy contact with kids! and the shame of people knowing! Same as any other paedo! As you said it should come with the very maximum of sentance due to that very fact. It's their job title etc that messes with a childs head even more when abuse happens. No doubt he wont be de frocked he will be moved to aother town like usual. You have to wonder if the judge is not also one with sentences like this! Plenty of them are! Can we not petition sentences like these?",
