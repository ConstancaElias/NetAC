        "postText": "Leader of the Liberal Democrats Ms Swinson is presenting her party as the main \u2018Remain\u2019 option in the upcoming December election.',' 'She has suggested she could be the next Prime Minister and has launched scathing attacks on both of her main opponents \u2013 Tory leader Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Ms Swinson said both are unfit to lead the country as her party plans to revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit without a referendum.', 'Yet in 2018, when she was the deputy leader of the Lib Dems, she staunchly defended calls for a \u00a3300,000 bronze statue of Mrs Thatcher, despite the two of them having completely different policies.', 'As political correspondent Harry Yorke wrote in The Telegraph last year, Ms Swinson was certainly \u201can unlikely ally\u201d for the cause.', 'Yet, her support stemmed from her strong feminist views.', 'She dubbed those opposed to the statue as \u201cpretty sexist\u201d and said there was a clear \u201cwhiff of misogyny\u201d about the rejection of the tribute.', 'Writing in the Mail on Sunday on March 4, 2018, Ms Swinson said: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt some of the vitriol directed at Margaret Thatcher also carries a whiff of misogyny. Whatever anyone thinks of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s politics, there can be no dispute about her significance.\u201d', 'She explained: \u201cShe was our first female Prime Minister and the longest-serving premier of the 20th century.', '\u201cThat achievement alone \u2013 for me and my whole generation \u2013 is more than significant enough to warrant a prominent statue in our public realm.\u201d', 'Despite the cost of the statue being covered by private donors, Westminster Council rejected plans for the likeness in January last year twice \u2013 firstly, on the basis that the statue could be vandalised.', 'Secondly, because the square had reportedly reached \u201cmonument saturation\u201d.', 'Yet, Ms Swinson said: \u201cEleven monuments of men currently loom large around Parliament Square \u2013 and not a single woman.\u201d', 'She did add that the statue of suffragist Millicent Fawcett was to be unveiled in April, a month after she wrote the article, but argued it was not enough to balance the numbers.', 'Ms Swinson also referenced the female royal statues dotted around London: \u201cWhile Queen Victoria boosts the numbers of women status and unnamed nude women are not hard to find \u2013 data suggests fewer than 1 in 30 statues in the UK depict a real woman from history who wasn\u2019t in the Royal Family.\u201d', 'She also said that as a proud Scot, where \u201clocal steelmaking and coal mining industries were hit hard by Thatcher\u2019s policies\u201d, she understands \u201csome might be surprised\u201d by her support.', 'Yet, she argued, \u201con some issues [Mrs Thatcher] was right\u201d, and \u201cshowed impressive skills negotiating the UK rebate with our European neighbours\u201d.', 'Then Ms Swinson added: \u201cWhile I am no Margaret Thatcher fan, there is one thing in particular for which I do thank her. As a little girl growing up in the Eighties it never even crossed my mind to doubt that a woman could be a Prime Minister.\u201d', 'She concluded: \u201cI now spend a significant amount of my time trying to find policy solutions to change the unethical corporate behaviour that Thatcherism unleashed.', '\u201c[But] since when did we only erect statues of men with whom everyone agreed?', '\u201cIf we want gender equality, we have to fight for space for women we vigorously disagree with, as well as those we support.\u201d', 'Ms Swinson's arguments appear to have been overlooked, though.', 'Plans for a statue of Mrs Thatcher in Parliament Square were abandoned and the tribute to the Iron Lady was to Lincolnshire, her home county, earlier this year.', 'Ms Swinson also accused ITV of sexism this week.', 'The broadcaster did not invite her to join a live debate between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn in the run-up to the election, so she declared it \u201can establishment stitch-up\u201d and has threatened legal action.', 'Sky News has since proposed a debate between all three of them and Ms Swinson has already agreed.",
