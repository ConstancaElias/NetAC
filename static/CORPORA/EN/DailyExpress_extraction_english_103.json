        "postText": "The 87-year-old writer claimed that millennials \u2013 people aged between 20 and 34 \u2013 should not be criticised for being self-centred or ignorant because their parents are to blame.', 'She said: \u201cWe should stop being beastly to the snowflakes since we, their forebears, left them with such a mess to clear up and no tools to deal with it.', '\u201cToday\u2019s young grow up into a violent, angry, unstable environment, all too likely to end up jobless, homeless and childless, unlikely to reach their full potential.', '\u201cThey are probably the most despairing generation conceived. The least we can do is not add to their burden by slagging them off.\u201d', 'But she added that the generational resentment was not one-sided.', '\u201cI don\u2019t think they like old people,\u201d she said.', '\u201cWe don\u2019t move fast. We get in their way. We pay with cash. We don\u2019t have smartphones and we criticise them. So it\u2019s a two-way street.\u201d', 'Defending millennials who lack historical knowledge, Weldon accused teachers of teaching \u201conly certain bits of history which they approve of\u201d.', 'She also criticised overbearing parents who put their children under too much pressure, and pointed to the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal and the bankers who caused the 2008 financial crash as examples of a lack of morality in the older generation.', '\u201cThere\u2019s no punishment for anybody provided they can talk well,\u201d she said.', '\u201cThey\u2019re building their own morality.\u201d', 'Weldon\u2019s new novel, After The Peace, follows a millennial and \u201csperm bank baby\u201d called Rozzie.', 'In one passage, Weldon writes of \u201cpoor, baffled, indignant, workdeprived, renting-not-owning millennials\u201d who have been let down by their \u201ccareless, stupid, smug\u201d parents.', 'She said: \u201cIf the new millennials \u2013 at best dependent on the bank of mum and dad, at worst on benefits in a shrinking job market \u2013 should despise and hate the old, it\u2019s not surprising.', '\u201cWe brought the millennials into this rather extraordinary, slightly insane world and then they turn out to be what they are.', '\u201cThrough the drug and money culture of their parents, we\u2019re landed with the product of what is our fault.\u201d', 'After The Peace will be released on Thursday.', 'DO WE HAVE A GENERATION OF SNOWFLAKES?', 'NO - Says Silja Litvin Psychologist and founder of PsychApps', 'I FIND the term \u201csnowflake\u201d very disagreeable and unjustly aimed at anyone who allows themselves the freedom to express their emotions \u2013 something that\u2019s vital for good mental health.', 'I also feel it has lost all meaning as anyone and everyone is called a snowflake these days. Millennials are probably the toughest and most unappreciated generation out there.', 'The economic situation the average millennial faces aside, they also have to deal with a perfect storm of media from early childhood that most members of the older generations would not be able to stomach.', 'Their parents\u2019 generations weren\u2019t informed enough to stop their children watching hours of TV and spending time on computers and mobile devices. Consequently, many millennials were subjected to a whole new level of programming that handicaps them for life if not actively worked against.', 'In one day millennials are exposed to 34 GB of information \u2013 more than the average human had to process in their lifetime in the 15th century. Most of this information is unhealthy, designed to evoke feelings of insufficiency and need \u2013 then filled by products.', 'Young people\u2019s brains are filled with the noise of hypersexuality, porn and economic worries. They often lack intimacy and connections with other people.', 'A decrease in attention span and empathy go hand in hand with increased depression and anxiety. All the while millennials are working long hours, fighting for the good causes they believe in and trying to be healthy.', 'YES - Says Ann Widdecombe Daily Express columnist', 'MY parents would have defined a safe space as a bomb shelter. My generation would have defined sexism as refusing a woman finance without her husband\u2019s signature and ageism as compulsory retirement at 60. Millennials think a safe space is somewhere where you cannot see a statue of somebody who might have had the values prevalent 200 years ago.', 'They think wolf-whistling is sexism and ageism is too many wrinklies on TV. They believe they have a right to go through life unoffended by anything and look for causes of grievance in the most innocent of remarks, wailing to the authorities, the boss or the police.', 'Of course you could blame parents and teachers for always making \u201cpositive\u201d comments even where there is absolutely nothing to be positive about. But ultimately, we are all responsible for ourselves \u2013 including the millennials.",

            "commentText": "Although younger generations have found certain things more difficult than us just-post-war lot, such as affording to buy a house, in a lot of ways their life has been a lot cushier. They have never known rationing, never wondered what a <b> banana </b>might taste like, never had to eat food they disliked because it was that or nowt or craved sweeties that were like gold-dust. Never virtually had to leave home at 17 to go out into the big bad world to find digs and a  job and fend for themselves. One could argue that the protection of, what we would call spongeing, off parents into their 30's and even 40's,  because they can't find a job paying enough to enable them to get on the housing market, is a disadvantage or one could say that  these people possibly lack the necessary drive to get up off their butts and use a bit more initiative. Neither argument is truly fair because over time, the present generation has been brought up by one or two post-war generations, who have gradually themselves lost the skills necessary to instil  traditional disciplines and training into their own offspring.<b>  Snowflake</b> is one description used by those born in different times, although todays' lot have to survive in a world that is equally as tough as any before but in different ways. Who or what has made it so is open to argument but we are moving to times wher<b> e nobod</b>y has ever known any differnt and todays' standards will become the norm. Wherever next I wonder?",

To a limited extent that is true, but one also needs to learn how to control ones basic emotions.

When I grew up my most distant relation an aunt and uncle lived nearly ten miles away, and what a journey that was. But today my brother and sister alllive in different countries and the distance apart is over 5000miles. It was 20 years since  I saw my older brother who has now died in Cyprus. My own children are in different countries and no doubt their children will soon grow a pair of wings. On refection I would turn the clock back to say 1958 and would be happy if time stood still.",

Good old-fashioned parenting and their children will be well prepared for life.",
