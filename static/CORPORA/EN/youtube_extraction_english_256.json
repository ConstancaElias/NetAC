The reservations are DUMPING GROUNDS for toxic chemicals, mining tailings, and nuclear waste...I can go on if you would like.\n\nNow the term environmental <b> racism </b>is a modern MADE-UP term to to help with DEFLECTING blame from corporations who do so under the radar and paying off corrupt government officials. To JUST bring up ONE demographic only is SHEER ignorance. There are MANY demographics that are affected by it NOT JUST<b>  BLACK</b>  it about those who have no voice or are ignorant to being used for profiteering corporations, politicians and others.\n\nThis story is a good one HOWEVER it focuses on just one demographic and IGNORES all other nuances of corruption caused by the elites towards the uninformed people no matter WHAT demographic they belong to.",

As long as people are fighting and bickering amongst one another THEY keep control over the narrative, stop with your naivety. It's in your personal neighborhood you need to fight for, your rights and dignity. I live in Alaska and we have one of the most corrupt state governments bought off by the oil companies. We have personal wells where I live and with the fracking that is being done and fyi I just LEARNED of it last year! My water has been affected by the oil companies not enough to worry yet, but what the oil companies are doing are affecting the water supply in the entire area is poison.\n\n Corruption cares NOT for racial differences its about preventing people from knowing WHAT they are doing. Get involved WITH your neighborhood and the corporate interests that move you. \n\nFlint Michigan ring any bells? Water to flint was diverted from the reservoir they were getting and changed to the river in which they were poisoned by.  No one in Flint knew if this until they were all getting sickened by it. Nestle Bought off the state government by the Nestle water bottling company for $200 a year...and they are STILL getting away with it.... catch my drift!",

Knowing the man has a history of being a bigoted <b> racist.</b> Poor white people can smd with their mother's lips. Poor white ppl do not give af about<b>  black</b> ppl. We have been doing this for 100s of years now. Trying to appeal to the white man JUST to see us as human beings. Doing that WWJD nonsense...Turning the other chek when abused. The PTSD IS REAL...Then there are the coocoo white ppl. The liberals. The feminists...the gays, all the other \"people of color\" who can't gain acceptance from white people. So they corral us all into one big happy family called \"minorities\" or \"people of color.\" Yaayyyy That \"stronger together\" bs where anybody can be a minority. Including a whit<b> e woma</b>n... i'm aware that might be you... no offense.... but this is my reality. And this is why white ppl NEVER get it. \nIt's these very \"poor white ppl\" that go join \"the man\" and enter their police forces... the ones where the only qualification necessary TO POLICE A COMMUNITY WITH DEADLY FORCE is a high school diploma..... and they don't put these uneducated police in white neighborhoods.... no no no..... they put them right in t<b> he bla</b>ck neighborhoods... trigger happy hungry for power \"poor white people\" who when given a chance will not hesitate to end our lives... and find comfort in the system governed by people that look like him. YOU DON'T HAVE WORRY ABOUT WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND BRING MURDERED BY A FVKN COP. U don't have to worry about your child being pulled ober and roughed up by policr and worrying if they'd come home. Our struggles are unique. You do  not come from the legacy that i do Miss Soracco lol.\nM'lady i have no doubt that you're an amazing person that is well intentioned ....... but this has happened before. It happened in the late 1800's into the early 1900's with our women.... where white women seeking suffrage coral<b> led bl</b>ack women into their movement to build numbers, and when they got what they wanted, they left them behind. It happened in the 60's and 70's when we were fighting for civil rigjts and<b>  th<b> e <<b> /b</b</b>>>LGBT hitched their wagon onto ours. Now ca<b> lli<b> n</b</b>>g a g<b> ay <b> p</b</b>>erson gay is offensive..... but a police officer can shoot an unarmed CHILD IN THE FCKN STREETS and walk free....and that child be forgotten.\nCollectively WE HAVE NO FRIENDS. \nOf course there are those here and there that are genuinely good people and want the best for everyone and are solid allies. But i have seen this movie before. It always ends the same. I'd be a fool to continue doing the same thing over,and over, and over, and over again....and expect a different result. That's called insanity.\n\nI am not insane.\nI am no fool.",
