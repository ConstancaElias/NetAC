        "postText": "'The controversial decision to remove the painting comes in the wake of the Hollywood MeToo movement and the banning of Formula 1 grid girls.', 'But critics say a visit to many European beaches would reveal far more public nudity.', 'The portrayal of the Greek myth Hylas And The Nymphs was painted by John William Waterhouse in the 1890s.', 'In place of the painting, which is now skulking in a storeroom to protect sensitive 21st century art lovers, is a handwritten poster.', 'It declares that the removal is to prompt conversation about how we display and interpret artworks in Manchester\u2019s collection.', 'It adds: This gallery presents the female body as either a \u2018passive decorative form\u2019 or a \u2018femme fatale\u2019.', 'Let\u2019 s challenge this Victorian fantasy.The gallery exists in a world full of intertwined issues of gender, race, sexuality and class which affect us all.', 'How could artworks speak in more contemporary, relevant ways?', 'Gallery bosses said the removal of the painting was an artistic act by artist Sonia Boyce. And the poster is plastered with yellow sticky notes carrying comments by visitors.', 'But the reaction on social media has been almost universally hostile. Ali Radicali tweeted: If removing art to appease establishment mores is \u2018art\u2019 then I guess the Nazis were pioneers in the field.', 'Dr Anna Maria Barry tweeted: It is not only ridiculous but borderline offensive to conflate this cheap publicity stunt with important MeToo debates.', 'Katherine Woolf tweeted: We can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t try to erase the past. We need to engage with the present. Give female artists more funding and more space to express their views and ideas.', 'Saffron Blaze tweeted: You just told millions of women they need to be ashamed of their body. Burqas for all.', 'Another Twitter user, Sarah M, wrote: If anyone is offended by this painting then there is something seriously wrong with them.', 'Alan Rain took a harder line declaring: They need to put it back and stop pretending to be the Taliban.', 'Not everyone was outraged. Rachel Coldicutt said: Galleries don\u2019t have to promote compliant, eroticised images of women.', 'Lending weight to the publicity stunt theory, gallery bosses tweeted: However you may feel, it has provoked discussion.'",
