        "postText": "The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee had heard claims from England striker Eni Aluko that she had been told that the second part of a contracted payment of \u00a380,000 would be withheld unless she agreed to state publicly that the FA was \u201cnot institutionally racist\u201d.', 'The Parliamentary session had been called to look into the circumstances of the dismissal of England women\u2019s team coach Mark Sampson for making two unacceptable comments as part of ill-advised \u201cbanter\u201d, followed by allegations of a cover-up and botched investigations by the FA.', 'Aluko had been promised the five-figure sum for her silence over the allegations that would eventually prompt a final, full investigation of Sampson\u2019s tenure, the results of which were delivered two days ago.', 'Yesterday, though, there were gasps from the public gallery as Aloku said: \u201cMartin Glenn said if I wrote a statement he would release the second tranche of the money.', '\u201cI felt that was bordering on blackmail. I categorically refused to write it. For Martin Glenn to say I should say that in order to get a payment I was contractually agreed to is appalling.\u201d', 'Glenn countered by claiming the second payment was withheld after taking legal advice as a result of a tweet Aluko made public which said, \u201cAt least we now know the FA\u2019s stance on derogatory racial remarks by an England manager. Ignore, deny, endorse. In that order\u2019.\u201d', 'Glenn, however, was accused of acting \u201cillegally\u201d when he told a newspaper reporter that Katharine Newton was chosen as the barrister to lead the final investigation because she was black and a woman but retracted that statement by saying his comments were made at \u201cthe end of a long day and came out all wrong\u201d.', 'Chairman Greg Clarke voiced his continuing support for his chief executive but appeared to support the politicians\u2019 criticisms over the due diligence process Glenn oversaw with regard to the appointment of Sam Allardyce as men\u2019s team manager before he himself took office.', 'However, he fired a strong personal attack at PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor, further adding to the sense of a culture of in-fighting ripping apart the national game.', 'He recounted the story of a \u201csafeguarding victim\u201d who wept openly in front of him because the PFA had stopped paying for counselling while still giving \u201cmillions to the CEO, and to his pension\u201d.', 'Clarke added: \u201cThey are walking away from alcoholics, they are walking away from addicted gamblers and they are walking away from people like him \u2013 I\u2019ll never look up to their governance.\u201d', 'The FA panel, which also included technical director Dan Ashworth and human resources director Rachel Brace, revealed that Sampson is currently considering an unfair dismissal case but began the gruelling four-hour session with a statement of apology from Glenn.', '\u201cOn behalf of the Football Association I would like to sincerely apologise to Eniola Aluko and Drew Spence,\u201d he said.', '\u201cBased on new evidence submitted to independent barrister Katharine Newton, she has now found that they were both subject to discriminatory remarks made by an FA employee. This is not acceptable.', '\u201cIn her final report Katharine Newton concluded that on two separate occasions Mark Sampson made ill-judged attempts at humour, which as a matter of law were discriminatory on grounds of race.\u201d', 'However, when offered the opportunity to apologise there and then to Aloku, who was sat behind him in the room, Clarke declined but said: \u201cI will apologise to Eni personally. What will happen is I will get up, shake her hand and ask to speak to her personally. I will listen to her reflections. I want to engage with her.\u201d",

Personally, I thought the BBC were very fair with her, they mostly just did close ups of her and if her shaking hand was in the picture they quickly put a banner with her name on screen to hide the shake as best they could. Those of us who watched this programme know that she is not being truthful and Labour are not doing themselves any favours keeping this in the media !!!",
