        "postText": "Quizzed last month on whether he\u2019d resign if Labour lost the upcoming election, Jeremy Corbyn refused to answer, simply insisting the party was \u201cnot expecting to lose\u201d. But with increasing scrutiny on the Labour leader\u2019s vague Brexit policy, some believe it\u2019d be impossible for him to continue.', 'Here are all the possible candidates, with odds courtesy of Ladbrokes.', 'The shadow Brexit secretary, 57, was instrumental in forcing Mr Corbyn to accept that Labour would offer a second EU referendum.', 'His tenure as Shadow Brexit Secretary has made him a popular member of the Labour front bench.', 'One July 2019 poll named him favourite to succeed Jeremy Corbyn with 68 percent approval ratings amongst the Labour Grassroots.', 'The 40-year-old committed Corbyn-backer was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of John McDonnell.', 'She has served as shadow business secretary since 2017 and deputised for Mr Corbyn at PMQs earlier this year.', 'Ms Long-Bailey has been mentioned publicly as a potential future leader.', 'Yvette Cooper, 50, a former cabinet minister and leadership contender, has a wealth of experience in frontline British politics.', 'She has won praise for her Commons performances during the Brexit debates and was reportedly being lined up to replace Corbyn after the general election in 2017.', 'She has strong support from MPs and was described as the \u201cReal Leader of the Opposition\u201d by some in Westminster earlier this year.', 'A long-time Corbyn devotee, 39-year-old Angela Rayner Rayner shares her mentor\u2019s radical position on many issues.', 'The shadow education secretary has led the charge against sexism and bullying in the party.', 'Ms Rayner also has a fascinating life story which endears her to voters: she fell pregnant and left school at 16 before rising up the Labour ranks.', 'Ms Piddock, 32, was appointed to a junior shadow role, but has been promised a cabinet-level employment if Labour wins the general election.', 'She was elected MP for North West Durham in 2017 and quickly became a favourite among Corbyn supporters.', 'She was criticised early in her parliamentary tenure for saying she had \u201cabsolutely no intention of being friends with any Tories\u201d, calling them \u201cthe enemy\u201d.', 'The 59-year-old shadow foreign secretary was sacked from the front bench by Ed Miliband after a poor showing in a by-election and a distasteful tweet.', 'She returned under Mr Corbyn, but has since clashed with his allies over the party\u2019s Brexit policy.', 'However, she has won praise for her performances filling in for Corbyn at PMQs, as well as for her straight-talking media appearances.', 'A Corbyn loyalist, she has emerged as his de facto No. 2 and enjoys strong support from more left-wing party members and, importantly, many of the unions.",
