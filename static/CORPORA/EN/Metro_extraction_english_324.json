        "postText": "I was dismayed to read about the recent ruling that has denied Freddy McConnell\u2019s request to be named as father on his child\u2019s birth certificate.', 'Not only that but the registrar insisted he was listed as \u2018mother\u2019 with no option for a gender neutral alternative \u2013 despite the fact that Freddy is legally recognised as male.', 'The judge, Sir Andrew McFarlane, made his decision based on a definition of motherhood as \u2018the status afforded to a person who undergoes the physical and biological process of carrying a pregnancy and giving birth.\u2019', 'Yet he himself has highlighted the limitations of this definition and subsequently called for an overhaul of the current legislation.', 'There is clearly an urgent need for reform, as this issue affects other non-traditional families, not just transgender parents. At present, for example, UK law only permits the birth mother in a lesbian couple to be listed as \u2018mother\u2019 on the birth certificate (with the other listed as parent).', 'I\u2019m a transgender man who transitioned much later in life than Freddy. I came out when I was 45 years old and my kids were already 13 and 15.', 'Although I gave birth to them, I don\u2019t tend to think of myself as a mother anymore. I refer to myself as their parent \u2014 or sometimes jokingly as \u2018the uterus guy\u2019.', 'For those who are wondering, my kids call me by my name rather than using mum (which would feel very weird these days) or dad (which was already taken).', 'On official forms I choose \u2018parent\u2019 where possible. However, many forms don\u2019t allow that flexibility if they are asking for details of both parents.', 'My eldest daughter has just started university, and when I was filling out the forms for Student Finance I was faced with the question: are you the: 1) father 2) mother?', 'My first thought was: \u2018what on earth does it matter?\u2019', 'This narrow definition of motherhood, which focuses purely on pregnancy and birth, excludes cisgender mothers of adopted children, too.', 'I suspect that most transgender men would feel deeply uncomfortable at having the title \u2018mother\u2019 forced on them against their wishes', 'If it had been on paper instead of online, I\u2019d have been tempted to add: option 3) parent, or else leave them both blank and scrawl \u2018it\u2019s complicated\u2019 underneath. As it was, I checked father.', 'Later in the same form I had to give an emergency contact who lives at a different address. I put her biological dad\u2019s details down in that section. When asked to explain his relationship to her I put father there too, hoping it wouldn\u2019t confuse things.', 'My partner\u2019s details also had to go on the form as he lives with me, even though he\u2019s only been in my life for two years. Much to my amusement, a few days later he received an email from Student Finance that began: Dear X, Your child, Y, has applied for student finance.', 'I told him that it seems like congratulations are in order, as he\u2019s now considered the father of an 18 year old \u2014 according to Student Finance England.', 'Joking aside, I suspect that most transgender men would feel deeply uncomfortable at having the title \u2018mother\u2019 forced on them against their wishes.', 'When you identify as male, present as male, and go about your day to day life as a man, it\u2019s very jarring to be misgendered, and mother is undeniably a term which, until this ruling, has exclusively been applied to women.', 'An easy solution would be to introduce the system now in place in California, where on birth certificates they have space to list the details of two people, simply stating \u2018name of parent\u2019 for both. That takes care of business, leaving individuals to choose whatever gendered or non-gendered terms they wish to be used in their own families and day-to-day lives.', 'Making birth certificates more flexible would also benefit the child as well as the parents. How strange would it be to have the man who brought you up listed on your birth certificate as your mother, when to you he\u2019s always been \u2018dad\u2019?', 'I believe this is a human rights issue and an example of inequality that needs to be rectified urgently.', 'Transgender people already have to fight hard for recognition and acceptance in our society, and anything that can be done legally to make that process easier should be a priority. I see from Freddy\u2019s Twitter that he has already decided to appeal against the court\u2019s decision and I wish him the very best of luck.",
