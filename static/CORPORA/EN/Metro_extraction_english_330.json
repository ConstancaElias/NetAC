All feminists (and especially the radical ones) hate men and boys, but Terfs don't stop even when the men change <b> gender.</b>Sadly they are not few or far between. They are many, as the core feminist credo is to hate men, most of feminists are closeted Terfs and there is no way around it.That being said, to arrest a person, because of a \"hate speech\" online is pure insane and evil. You should also arest all those that where in the posts, and I am sure plenty on both sides where insulting each other!And you should also arest the police, as they are the only ones that actually use physical force against people  in these cases. Everyone else are just speaking, while the police actually does the most harm, they should be prosecuted with impunity, including their chiefs.The damage done by the Police is of huge magnitude comparing to the damage done by words online. If they want to prevent (or punish) emotional damage, then they should never ever touch a person's freedoms or even dare to call it! If you pretend that the people's \"emotional\" well being is sacred, then what the Police does is the worst crime in the entire debacle.I expect people to wake up and sue for emotional abuse the entire Police force soon enough. After all, if we go that path, we better make sure the state gets what it deserves when acts abusive towards our emotional well being.Arrests and threats to personal freedoms are way more abusive than mean words online! Prosecute the police asap!",

We shouldn't need to explain to adults that online abuse can be stopped by blocking somebody or not frequenting the chatrooms/social media platforms where the offence is deemed to have been caused. If the online abuse had manifested itself in the physical world (aka \"reality\") then yes, absolutely bring the police in.The victim needs help in dealing with the reality of the body they are in, not forcing society to pander to them and then having cosmetic procedures to maintain the illusion which, based on the article, seems to only fool themselves not those around them.I will reiterate my opening point, though. Bullying of anybody is wrong and should not be tollerated. That shouldn't necessarily be a police matter though as most adults have heard the phrase 'sticks and stones' before.",
