            "commentText": "I am obviously a bit late to the party but I have to support the particular statement of <b> sexism </b>being pleasurable because of it being a type of dominance assertion. With that said, the thing that is just as pleasurable for social justice warriors is asserting dominance by seeing<b>  sexism</b><b> , racis</b>m, hate speech and microagressions everywhere and feeling superior by pointing it out, even in situations where it is so ridiculous one wonders how someone can take their arguments seriously. Also for the last question of the video, i feel both threatened and annoyed, threatened by the real possibility of having to alter my everyday actions that are not propagati<b> ng sexi</b><b> sm, rac</b>ism etc. of any kind or not being able to express myself because of political correctness and annoyed by the hipocricy of SJW's trying to oppress anyone's aspects of a certain lifestyle just for the sake of avoiding microagressions that most of the time just are not there. This was not my original tought on the topic back in 2014 and political corectness probably got more radical than it was before, but seeing this video in 2019 just screams \"lack of critical thinking\" for me, since taking away something immoral but pleasurable just to cause more unpleasurable events is just not worth it. Summary: Screw human trash whose best part of the day is being sexis<b> t or ra</b>cist unironically. Screw SJW's whose best part of the day is having an argument about non-existant microagressions. And most importantly, let the man wear his goddamn t-shirt.",

            "commentText": "In all of history and today still men were always superiror to women in every way other than nurturing children. We know now from decades of research that men and women are about equal in intelligence, and hence the majority of positions of influence, like politics, corporations, government or publications, just to name a few, can be performed equally well by either <b> gender.</b> Personality and temperament varies greatly from person to person regardless of<b>  gender</b>. \n\nAnd yet men are still superior. In our civilization it is not acceptable to promote that view, but that view is part of the mentality, conscious or not, of millions of Americans and Europeans. In less advanced and democratic parts of the world <b> a woma</b>n is explicitly inferior to a man, her worth ranging fr<b> om\nnothi</b>ng to the value of her virginity and family honor. And what's more that is completely natural to deny women equal standing and allow for them to be abused.\n\nBut here in America try as we may to demonstrate our commitment<b>  to gen</b>der equality, the reality is much different from what we want to believe. Men still call the shots in business, government, technology, positions of power. The women who make it into the ranks of the magnates are indeed admired, for the ironic reason that they are women who have won the privilege to matter as much as the greatest men. By recognizing successful women we empower women and pay due respect to the established social order of male superiority. The women's sucess is not so much in whatever they have achieved but the fact that their achievements were great enough to prove their equal value to successful men. \n\nWhy? Why are men assumed naturally superior, more capable, more intelligent, more fit to make decisions, to lead, than women. This is the unspoken truth shared by everybody, even those who fight against it. We all accept that as the norm, even if we want to change it, our mind somehow assumes it the natural assumption a<b> bout ge</b>nder, wrong though it may be...\n\nI have an idea. Men are clearly superior to women in a specific way. And I mean, not an opinon, but a concrete, undisputable superiority over women. Men are faster, stronger, more physically able than women. Sure there are women who can take down a man three times their size or who can outrun 95% of men. But the fa<b> stest </b>woman will always be much slower than the fastest man, the str<b> ongest</b> woman will never match up to the strongest men. The most <b> skille</b>d woman fighter will lose when up against an equally skilled man. Because no matter how hard or how much she wo<b> rks, t</b>he woman will never close the gap of physical ability between herself and the man who has done an equal amount of work. This is fact. and we all accept it as fact. And deep down inside, despite all our enlightenment, we value physical superiority like all animals. because in the beginning of our history, it was the only thing that mattered. The strongest person was the most valuable person, in all ways that mattered. And that is thousands of years worth of foundation of the value we ascribe to a human. By this value women are inherently worse than men. Though they may be strong, capable, intelligent, or whatever admirable quality they may have, it's really insignificant when compared to their male counterparts. The barrier was so impermeable that all character traits were subject to it including intellect. Men are superior, because they have always been superior, that is the normal state of <b> the h</b>uman race. This is the fou<b> ndation</b> of sexism. It may sound ridiculous, but it is very deeply ingrained in our understanding of the world, reinforced millions of times in every culture everywhere at every stage of human civilization. The fact that it is no longer relevant given our great intellectual achievements, our technology, our weaponry, and the advancement of our logic, is not enough to overcome the instinct to give all respect to the strongest person among us, and that will<b>  never</b> be a woman. In fact I see no way of c<b> hanging</b> this sexism so long as the physical superiority remains true. So it is interesting to watch the devel<b> opment of th</b>e transgender movement, and the complete confusion it causes. Apart from the bathroom issues, what does this mean for women sports? From a purely biological standpoint, the<b>  defin</b>ition of woman is becoming hard to figure out. If anybody regardless of their physical compo<b> sition</b> can be a woman - or a man - then what is the need for genders? add to that the mo<b> vement </b>to reject gender altogether, those who identif<b> y as an</b<b> >dr<b> ogy</b</b>>nous, gender queer etc, and I think this is the point of human evolution, the very early stages anyway,<b>  of the</b> rejection of gender as no longer needed for social order. Obviously it's a small rather unpopular movement right now, and in many places so offensive that those individuals are in danger of being killed, yet it it is a movement nonetheless, and growing. And if it persists <b> that is</b> what will end sexis<b> m - the</b> uselessness of gender when it is no longer clear and defined and seen as natural. Feminists are wasting their time. That's why I'm not one. Someday I see a much more advanced society of beings who are not divided because of ridiculous physical differences and who see the mind as the only relevant expression of a person. Or maybe I'm just imagining the society ai's who outlive our extinction or self destruction",

            "commentText": "From what I know one of the biggest correlations known to sociological research (a heavily liberal/leftist-dominated field, by the way) is the one between how egalitarian a country/culture is and how much men and women tend to differ in interests and career choices (it's 0.7 I think).\nThe more feminist the culture the more male-dominated the male-dominated fields and the more female-dominated the female-dominated fields. Like in Norway, Sweden and such.\n\nIf more women are needed in STEM fields, for reasons of diversity, why isn't there the same emphasis on getting more men into psychology or veterinary medicine? Or to put it this way: If formerly male-dominated fields like these two became female-dominated after the second wave of feminism, why didn't STEM fields? Or...I don't know...plumbing...\n\nAlso, the dominance hierarchy of \"call-out culture\" (gaining prestige b y exposing <b> sexism,</b><b>  racism</b>, etc...) on the internet is associated with growing up with social media.\nAnd what it is people are in danger of losing are their jobs. Or careers. Like Lindsay Sheperd for example. Because it's a prestige system that has external costs. Other people, who are not part of this call-out culture, and don't want to be (i.e. anyone born before 1995 :D), pay the price. Also more and more ex-SJWs are coming out with stories and accounts describing an environment of anxiety and depression. So, not even SJWs are actually enjoying being SJWs. They're just conditioned that way. Just like only 3 percent of all teenagers on Instagram & co. are actually liking it, while the vast majority feels anxious during, yet still participates.\nTo me it's not a question about whether or not to let them be, but about how to help them.",

However, if I saw someone wearing that equivalent, it wouldn't make me feel like I was present among misandrists so much as I would be enjoying the presence of the entertaining shirt worn by someone who normally wears quite plain work attire. It's not objectifying becau<b> se s</b>ex is quite the oppositte, it's humanizing. A romantic motive in a story makes someone int<b> o a<b>  </b</b>>red blooded mammal with a real set of motivations. We've known this for long enough that a cheap way to make a character appealing in an otherwise uninspired movie is to add a romantic subplot so that the movie has more mass appeal. Titanic being a very real example of this. \n\nSo when people get upset about sexualization and call it objectification, it's really not.",

Human male are more prone to evolutionary mutations than human female, so there is more extremes on male Gaussan distribution than on the female one. That reflects in human species behaviour as well: males tend to take more and bigger risks, while females tend to play it safer. STEM field is a high-risk one: one can work hard for decades, and not get any ground-breaking results. I understand that there is <b> gender </b>bias inside the hard sciences communities, and it's something that should be fought, but putting the blame for disproportional number of females in hard sciences SOLELY on mysoginism is criminally stupid.",

I completely fail to see the connection between 'Guy wears a shirt' and 'fewer women go into STEM careers'. You can't really lean on 'boys club' mentality either, as studies have shown that fewer women (as a percentage) go into STEM careers in very liberal countries than they do in countries with stronger <b> gender </b>roles\n\n2) As clearly demonstrated in the beginning of your video, plenty of women are not offended by the shirt, and plenty of men are. Therefore, acting like this is both completely and solely affecting women is both disingenuous and an insult to the women who are sensible enough to not let something this petty bother them\n\n3) Characterising<b>  sexism</b> as a power trip is essentially a strawman that allows you to tar anyone that disagrees with you. You offer no evidence that anyone actually thinks this way, only rhetoric. This point is so lacking in substance that i'm amazed you even mentioned it, nevermind trying to spin it as a life lesson to close out the video\n\nTo answer your question, i'm both annoyed that one of the greatest achievements in human history was blighted by a ridiculous overreaction to something barely out of the norm, and threatened that completely innocent behaviour with absolutely no ill intent behind it (no, not even subconscious ill intent) can be spun so dramatically as to stir up a mob of hate against someone who di<b> d nothin</b>g wrong\n\nPS: the shirt was designed and made by<b>  a wom</b>an, so all the criticism of the shirt is having an exponentially worse effect on women in creative industries than the shirt itself is having on women in STEM. If I made something for my friend that got such a bad reaction from the public that he had to make a tearstained apology over it, I'm not sure I'd ever want to make anything again.",

When i spoke to him about it after class as to why he felt the need to say something like that in an entire room of men he simply said ' you do not potray the image that the STEM division of this college. Tone down the look and maybe well talk. Then he jokingly said 'or grow a penis' i just laughed because i didnt know what else to do. This is a man who ran the STEM department at my college and could have a very big impact on my future. \n\n\nAll i do now is keep my head down and kill it on exam days.

This seems like a<b>  re<b> d</b</b>> herring to stop us from examining the issues of far greater importance. The shirt is the equivalent of showing up for work on casual Friday with a swear word stamped across your chest. I wouldn't want to be that guy, but it wouldn't be personally upsetting or stay with me longer than any other water cooler story. I've had a man stick my hand down his pants in a grocery store, been groped on the bus, been denied a promotion due to not wearing makeup. I could care less about the shirt.",

The <b> sexism </b>piece comes in when one<b>  gender</b> is far more often portrayed as being sexy, and that their worth is, in part, derived, from their physicality and sexuality. So, women are far more likely to not only be portrayed a<b> s sexua</b>l, almost ubiquitously, but also more likely have their sexuality emphasized as important over other important features (one example is how rare leading roles in media are for non-physically attractive women, when the reverse is not true of men).  Another example, it is rare to see a camera linger and move over a man's body as if that body was being viewed through the eyes of someone sexually attracted to the man's body.  There may be reasons this happens, but those reasons do not change that this contributes to a cultural understanding of women's bodies and who i<b> s \"sexu</b>al.\" This actually is unfair to both men and women . Men often complain about having a LACK<b>  of sex</b>ual presence, never being complimented, never being pursued, as opposed to  always being the pursuer. All of this, in part, relates to how men and women are portrayed sexually, and disadvantages that come from being either reduced to one's sexuality, or conversely, having one's sexuality ignored entirely.<b>  The se</b>xism  at work piece comes in when employers, co-workers, interviewees, also start looking at women through this len<b> s, as s</b>exual beings first instead of fully human, and w<b> e know </b>sexism does show up in this wa<b> y, from</b> sexual harassment onward.",

That shirt presents women as <b> sexual </b>objects, and<b>  sexual</b> objectification of women is immensely more prevalent than that of men. There'<b> s nothin</b>g wrong with sexiness by itself, but over time our culture has started to focus so heavily on the sexiness of women and so little on anything else women have to offer (case in point the existence of the Bechdel Test) that women start to feel like the message they're getting is that only their sexiness matters. This is the root of self-esteem issues, because culture is telling them that if their appearance isn't up to pa<b> r, nothi</b>ng else is going to redeem them or make them worthy of love. This shirt is another of those thousands of images that reinforce this same theme. \n\nThis is something that only women have to put up with.

                    "commentText": "goateeguy11221122 Ok. So I watched the video again and nope. Opinion is the same. Exactly how I argued it months ago with I guess a few tweaks. And now to your response...\n\n' \u2018It's just a shirt' shows a lack of understanding of the power of symbolic meaning.'\nLooks like I'll be introducing the concept of symbolic interpretation.\n\n'That shirt presents women as <b> sexual </b>objects, and<b>  sexual</b> objectification of women is immensely more prevalent than that of men.'\nHere's where that symbolic interpretation(might be a thing not sure) comes in to play. See the problem with this argument is you are asserting your interpretation of the meaning of the shirt. If you're going to use the argument of symbolic meaning you have to give way to interpretation and that what you think the shirt means might not be what it means, because other people are going to see it differently. Also, I have to say demand and supply theory applies here. It's not a suprise to anyone that objective sexuality is more focused on women than in men\n\n\n'There'<b> s nothin</b>g wrong with sexiness by itself, but over time our culture has started to focus so heavily on the sexiness of women...'\nI'm going to need to stop your quote right here just to interject something. What do you think the reason is culture decided to focus more on the sexiness of women. What exactly do you think caused this shift? \n\n'...and so little on anything else women have to offer (case in point the existence of the Bechdel Test)...'\nWhat exactly do you mean by so little? Are we talking percentages? Any numbers? In comparison so say, before all the sexiness came in to the scene or in comparison to something else and if so, data? Also, the Brchdel Test is <b> a  du</b>mb test. It has no bearing on the quality of a movie or its characters(yes including the women characters).\n\n'...that women start to feel like the message they're getting is that only their sexiness matters.'\nMaybe you, but this just sounds like more conjecture conclusions. Yes women are feeling more and more that only their sexiness matters that's why they make up 60percent of college graduates.\n\n'This is the root of self-esteem issues, because culture is telling them that if their appearance isn't up to p<b> ar, noth</b>ing else is going to redeem them or make them worthy of love.'\nIs this the argument for man's shirt harms women?\ud83d\ude10 listen. What exactly do you mean by culture is telling you x. Through what medium is culture saying x? If it's entertainment, don't watch it. If it's ads, ignore them. If it's people mocking you then it depends(bullying would be more get authority figures involved, but something like person x doesnt like you because xxx features... Is that a problem needing fixing? Do we need to re-educate people to like what they don't like?) I don't see a solution underneath the complaining. The only solution I'm hearing implied here is that we need to take a conservative approach to sexuality to stop this(and that sounds insane). In fact, your cranking up what some people would call a tendency to the extreme to make a point. But, besides that, in a lot of ways culture isn't saying this stuff. It sounds more like you're living in the 1980's. \n\n'This is something that only women have to put up with.'\nOk. This is just a false statement. A falsism if I've ever seen one.\n\n'It's not a situation where women are being coddled for something that any person should have the grit to put up with; it's a situation where men don't have any issue like this at all, and it's a disadvantage that only women face.'\nAre you still talking about the shirt? Because I do think if your problem is the shirt then yes I would call this coddling.\nAlso, again false statements. You can't just make claims like this with no empirical evidence and expect no pushback.\n\n'That's where<b>  the se</b>xism is, in the fact that men aren't made to obsess over their appearances to nearly the same degree.'\nOn AVERAGE sure. But you just said two statements ago that 'only a problem for women' yet what you're saying now already proves those statements false, because those statements can't be true if men ever worry about how they are perceived. If men ever worry about their appearance then yeah any media about showing the ideal man would get to some men. \n\n'It's not that we're trying to protect women from things that men deal with on a daily basis without breaking a sweat; it's that there's a real aspect of this that alienates women and just women. Not all women, sure'\nAnd that real aspect that alienates just women is....?\n\n'But I do think the women who speak out like \"this is fine, I don't know what everyone's getting so worked up about\" aren't sensitive to the fact that there really are women that are upset and turned off certain sub-cultures and communities by things like this.'\nOk. Also, there are some people that get really mad and turned off over certain things for the most benal of reasons. And I say to them what I say to people complaining over the shirtstorm. You're making this matter way too much. Society isn't this one big feminist critical theory lens to where every small thing that could be interpreted as gendered has this bigger societal purpose.\n\n'Having the grit to work through a less-than-ideal workplace environment because it's the career you feel passionate about is admirable, b<b> ut no </b>woman should have to work through issues like that in the first place. Trying to remove barriers like that is still fi<b> ghting </b>sexism.'\nI'd agree but we aren't talking about a situation of workplace harassment or men refusing to work with women or even keeping down women. What we are talking about is a shirt. A shirt ma<b> de by </b>a woman to this guy as a present he decided to show featuring drawings of women who for the most part looked like they were taking hold of their own sexuality. What this isn't is an opportunity to apply something such as<b>  this a</b>s sexual objectification, because once you can label something as objectification you can throw the book of sociological feminist theories to it and go off on several tangents about the state of society, self esteem of women, and workplace harassment. Because that, somehow has something to do with a shirt.",

Mainly here...\n [LINK] \nSo, now to your thing...\n\"You're in ability to understand basic concepts doesn't make you right.\"\nHere's where you are wrong. Because you see sexualization isn't a 'basic concept'. Sexualization is a term interpreted in many ways(though it's usually negative). The standards on how it's defined change a lot and have a lot of criteria if you're trying to be a bit nuanced about the subject. Am I right? Eh, I don't know. But with this link I've at least found a more nuanced definition.\nAs for your other stuff it's kind of complicated. Because from what I read the study I linked the 'problem' the authors of that study seem to have is with media. \n\n\"In other countries a naked person isn't necessarily seen as something <b> sexual,</b> ex. A nudity at baths or beaches in Europe. The reason this is bad is because when people see others in some state of undress there mind immediately goes to something<b>  sexual</b>.

It paints a disgusting target on women because it treats them as little more than objects f<b> or sexu</b>al pleasure. And to disrobe even partially is to make yourself a likely victim.\"\nThe way you paint it, it kind of sounds like a less tame version or sharia like culture. But the Apa paper I read comes to a more different situation. The problem for them seems to be that our culture treats sexuality too loosely and attempt to instill adult like themes of sexualization into children. To many people treating sexuality as important as you say but not by the same reasoning. For example, I'm not sure how the authors of that study would treat the idea of women going out without shirts considering for them that could be sexualization and promoting child pornography.\n\n\"But they are not all that women are capable of and not what they should be reduced to\"\nWell the study also offered some solutions to our problem including but not limited to...\nEducation programs in schools.\nReligion and other ethical institutions teaching kids.\nTeaching parents about the implications of media messaging.\nIncreased athletic programs.\n\nNow I don't Imagine any of these 'solutions' are going to make a 4 y<b> ear </b>old girl without a shirt look like 'not a problem' but I'm sure this will do some kind of good maybe. Though honestly I'm not really much of a fan of the work that's being said about APA and also I do agree with you that a lot of the things that we treat in our culture as big deals when it comes to female sexuality is a bit ridiculous, but a lot of that has more to do with prudishness than sexualization.",

I think some feminists are way too hostile to freedom for me not to get worried. However, I regard myself as being a liberal feminist, a free-speech advocate and I know there are others (but we tend not to be heard unfortunately). Obviously he should wear that shirt if he wants to. Yes, it's objectifying women and he should have that in mind, cuz he makes himself look bad to me and I bet to a lot of women. But he does not deserve to be treated like the devil for it. There are far worse people in the world we should focus on critizing.",

            "commentText": "People (including some further down this feed) try to end discussions by declaring that women today are experiencing greater equality than in the past or by demanding to be shown an example of a right that men have that women don't. It's not productive to stop the discussion once we reach the end of easily quantifiable things like \"can women vote.\" The discussion is more nuanced now than it was 100 years ago, because the problems that face today's women can't necessarily be fixed by introducing legislation. That doesn't mean they don't exist. It's also more difficult to quantify today's inequalities because not all women respond to the same issues in the same way, and not all men perpetuate these problems (and men are, obviously, not the sole perpetuators of harm or stereotype against women).\n\nAsks like \"Let us vote\" has been replaced with asks like \"Don't objectify us,\" which are harder to explain and don't change as visibly, since they're not binary. Something as innocuous as this shirt presents a problems for not all, but a good number of women who are treated poorly in the workplace by not all, but SOME men, and wearing such a thing in an academic or professional setting makes those women remember the current state of things: that they are generally less well-regarded in STEM (I was a software engineer at Google when the Damore manifesto leaked; that didn't feel awesome), and that their <b> gender </b>faces a greater likelihood of experiencing<b>  sexual</b> violence at the hand of SOME, NOT ALL men who are influenced IN PART by media that portrays women as status symbols valued for their aesthetics to be \"worn\" by men.",

Sorry if this reply sounds stupid, I'm kinda tired rn.\nDo you think most men think of women as human beings?\nI will be answering for most men, so \"not all men\" doesn't apply here. Men are aware of women as humans, better than ever before (just look at all the progress made from 19th century). They're just not considered as human as other men. The shirt discourse points to one of these problems: 99% of things women do is sexualized. Like, to the point of not being able to bend over without feeling awkward (this is a <b> lame </b>example but I'm sure you've seen more).  Men also have a hard time accepting women who don't fit a certain stereotype. If a<b>  woman</b> doesn't fit the long hair stereotype, then she must be pushed into th<b> e lesbia</b>n stereotype (ever heard the go<b> od o</b>ld \"she's doing it for attention!\"). Women are never encouraged to do anything that isn't considered feminine (I think there's a YouTube video about boy vs girl toys), so each girl that doesn't fit this stereotype has to face the consequences. It's not just \"you<b> 're we</b>ird haha\" it's more like \"how dare you? You aren't supposed to be like that.\" (I hope you got it)\nSimply put, men do think women are human, but there are still some double standards present in society. I know that some things will always be like that (women being considered weaker, because biology and not being able to take off their shirt in public), but I also know that some things just aren't ok ( women getting assaulted by co-workers, sexualized by the media, catcalled in public etc.)\nI hope you got my point, this took me a while to write.",

Small minded people with <b> nothing </b>better to do than shit on other people make mountains out of molehills and ruin other people's lives. You didn't used to meet these people: they are the brother of your friend that no one has seen in five years, and the sister of the guy who fixes your drainpipe that he thinks might be selling crack. /ignore, and move on with your life. Getting worked up over their opinion is not worth your time and effort. \nThe problem is that girls are told from Kindergarten, if not earlier by their parents, that math and science are not for them. They are steered away from these subjects early on. Math and science teachers, often the first male teachers they encounter, do little to make the subjects interesting to them. Vapid books written to appeal to girls whose idea of a good read is Seventeen Magazine do even more to push potential female scientists away. Those aren't the girls who are going to become scientists anyway, it's the ones who find the magazines ridiculous.  When a girl shows a talent for languages she isn't directed towards programming, but instead towards French lessons. Not that I am saying my French classes were a waste of time, but it would have been nice to know that programming languages were an option when I was nine instead of finding out about them in my 20s.  \nTo make matters worse, College usually sours women (and this is definitely true for me as well) on the idea of a career in Academia. The petty bickering, the harassment, the long hours and low salaries, the near-impossibility of landing a tenured position: most women just don't want to deal with it. There are plenty of jobs for a<b>  woman</b> with a scientific degree outside of academia, and the barriers for entry there are lower.  As biology, chemistry, physics and computer science become ever larger parts of the regular economy: Academia will need to change or struggle to attract anyone. It's primarily this which causes the statistics that you cited. Women may not be working in the field that they studied in college: that doesn't mean they got a shit job.  Since they work outside of universities, they also don't publish as frequently or at all. \nFinally: the usual definition of STEM fields is inherently biased. While they include the traditionally male-dominated field of video game development-despite the fact obvious to any gamer that at least half of video game devs are artists, not engineers-they do not include the traditionally female dominated fields of nursing and social work. These fields are equally quantitative, requiring a strong background in science. If you want to say that you are advocating for female scientists, you cannot just conveniently forget to count scientists when they happen to be mostly female.",

The human body should not be threatening. Remember?\n2. The women were not depicted negatively. They actually looked powerful and strong. I mean, they were wielding weapons, which are associated with men and male-dominated fields. They also were not being abused or harmed by a man (or anyone else). So what was the sexist message in the shirt? Their bodies? I thought being offended by <b> a woma</b>n's body was...sexist. So the women are scantily clothed. So what? I guess the characters are edgy or something. Women can dress however they want. That's been established. But when a man admires the female body enough to buy a shirt with one on it, it's immoral? Okay.\n3. The shirt h<b> as nothi</b>ng to do with the stem field. ANY man<b>  or wo</b>man could have worn that shirt. It just happened to be worn by a science guy.\n4. Many women avoid stem because it's not convenient enough to juggle with our other roles in life. It's not that deep. Everybody knows that child-rearing ends up falling on the women more than the men, while providing usually falls on the men more than the women. Stem degrees are time-consuming and expensive. They pay off over time, but they remain demanding. Not all women will be able to manage a family and demanding careers. It's just not realistic. But that's okay. To be honest, these constant scandals are actually putting more pressure on women to be in stem when we don't like it, not the opposite.\n5. I think the offense surrounding women's bodies comes from depictions of violence against t<b> hem, se</b>xual and nonsexual. This sometimes triggers women when we see an exposed female body in media. It's not just the body that bothers us. It's the primal fear of what we have been socialized to expect when our bodies are exposed to men. Understandably, this makes us uncomfortable. But that speaks to a bigger issue. This was a conversation we should have had with ourselves first, not men.\n6. Kim Kardashian has<b>  done no</b>thing wrong. Leave her out of this.",

I'm not even saying that you are incorrect in pointing out that there is a boys club in stem. However imagine you were a smart, if impressionable, young girl interested in science. However, every time you bring it up every one makes sure to tell you that stem is a toxic, hyper masculine boys club and you'll have you work cut out for you if you make that your career, fighting an uphill battle against a prejudiced and patriarchal system. Would you feel discouraged? Perhaps discouraged enough that you might much rather get a degree in literature or philosophy, which you also very much enjoy and which are apparently less of a pain in the ass for women to make a mark in? I would not blame you for that decision. Now what if you are a girl who is not discouraged by the notion of an uphill battle against tall odds, the kind of battle that multiple cultural figures like the nerd writer here have convinced you that you will most certainly encounter, will you likely be discouraged by a scientists goofy shirt because it has sexy women on it? I don't think you will.\nIf you were, I might feel inclined to call into question your commitment to the pursuit of science as a career in the first place. \nThe point of what I am staying is that, even assuming that science is a patriarchal boys club, if you are concerned about who might be discouraging girls from pursuing science you should look into the mirror. Frankly, I think that if a girl is young enough to be discouraged by this man's shirt she will only be so after someone like you has explained to her that it is something that she should find discouraging. Otherwise she might not have even noticed the shirt, being too distracted by the amazing scientific achievement taking place before her eyes.\n\nI have a few more questions for any one willing to answer. Should women, by majority opinion (or most vocal opinion as the case may be) be able to dictate the way a man is allowed to dress in public for the sake of their own personal comfort?\nIf so, should men be allowed the same control over the way women dress, like they had back in the day? As I recall it was one of the things women found very oppressive about olden times and it was considered progress when women were allowed to express themselves in whatever way they saw fit.\n So, if a female scientist were presenting her project on TV wearing a fairly tight, brightly <b> colored,</b> low cut shirt and bold<b>  re<b> d</b</b>> lip stick and was lambasted by men across the media because tho<b> se sexu</b>al displays were unseemly and shameless and she was probably trying to assert <b> her sex</b>ual power over the men working with her and she was giving women a bad name in the process, would you feel sympathy for those men or for<b>  the w</b>oman they were attacking for wearing a shirt they did not approve of?",

I notice that people also use the fallacy of composition with this topic as wel<b> l: \"sex</b>ism still exists, therefore<b>  the ge</b>nder disparity in industry X is d<b> ue to s</b>exism.\"\n\nI don't deny tha<b> t some mi</b>sog<b> yny and</b> gender bias still exists. But to argue t<b> hat tha</b>t sexism is systemic is a different claim altogether. When these arguments that vict<b> imize o</b>ne gender are made and propagated (especially without sufficient evidence), they perpetuate an \"us vs. them\" mentality throughout our society. This has the opposite effect that's desired. The same stereotypes that hurt women, also hurt men. The same stereotypes that hurt men, also h<b> urt wom</b>en. Gender issues on both fronts are very different, but arguably equal. You cannot solve one without solving the other. I'd be willing to go into this further, but this comment is long enough.\nThis same issue can also be<b>  appl</b>ied<b>  to rac</b>e and racism, but that's a discussion for another day.",

Every new idea or opinion is not meant to make you feel comfortable and if we are meant to stay quiet at just the though of making someone uncomfortable, that would be removing our right to express our thoughts or who we are.

We have desires to be loved by many, to compete against others and win (in order to feel better about ourselves now rather than anything but in the past it probably this trait was a crucial for hunting)etc and these desires are part of our human instincts to survive. That explains lots of things in my opinion; wanting to have more - of what? Well, basically everything. More wealth, more beauty etc. At the same time, we want to believe that being different from what we are immediately 'wrong' and perhaps that comes from the fear, fear of not knowing what the newness is, not being able to understand fully what it is. The modern world we live in is such a easily developing and changing one though. If you think about it, it has changed so much even within the past few decades - e.g the state of racial segregation in 50s America was pretty shockingly atrocious. Given the facts of history, I think we're heading to the right direction and hopefully that sort of fear or ignorance will eventually dissolve to <b> nothing </b>in the future.",

To say I think other wise to me is absolute horse shit but I come from a Conservative place. Now do I think that the shirt that guy wore was okay, no. I also think that he should be able to wear whatever he wants free from internet abuse.  I believe today's ideal of <b> sexism </b>is<b>  dumb</b>. I believe if you <b> a woma</b>n have a certain role just like men. I think th<b> at wom</b>an have a just as important game on a different field. If you ask me what I feel threatened by you're just gonna sum it up to a flip in power. For generations men have done the strenuous labor why women have done the heavy emotional lifting. If ever sin<b> gle wo</b>man can go outside right this second and do everything i've grown up learning then ill drop my views. If they can build a house, fix a pluming leak, dig a water well. Then every fear you assume I have will disappear no questions asked. But i've seen women do shit I couldn't even fathom emotionally. But does any ask how we feel. does anyone ask that we've been trained to shove our emotions down for some good reasons and now its a habit. what about all the loses we take or the suffers we endue but does anybody say anything. very few. this idea <b> that w</b>oman are sexulized is true but you know what. men may start out fantasizing about women but it ends up with us wanting a family someone to come home to to comfort a long days work. All I see from women now a days is this need. give me a shinny ring, give me shoes, give me this and that and shit on men for liking the way they look.\n(pause)\nRANT OFFICIALLY OVER.",

While the shirt here is probably not the one anyone should wear in a media announcement in science (it draws attention away from the subject), I have to question if anyone would really be uncomfortable working beside a person wearing it. In other words, the main problem is that the outcry was disproportional  to the offence. In my view, what this shows is that social media are a bully's medium. I'd be more uncomfortable working next to someone who participates in a media pile on like this than someone who wears a dorky shirt.",

A lot of men these days feel genuinely threatened by feminism because they feel as though the tables will flip and they'll be discriminated against.  Heck, I've been calle<b> d racis</b>t, bigote<b> d, homophob</b>ic, and sexist all because I'm a religious straight male conservative.\n\nI think that the autonomy of women encourages different career choices or just staying at home and teaching the next generation how to not screw humanity over.  Whereas the autonomy of a male encourages hard labour to provide for a wife and the next generation.  Do I think that women should be discouraged from STEAM jobs?  No!  But tumbler feminism (extreme feminism) has been more or less forcing women into those jobs and degrading women that stay at home or work traditional female jobs.\n\nWhen one party pushes their ideals too far, it flips the other on their back.  Then you have the same situation you were trying to get rid of, only reversed.\n\nIn short, all things in moderation.  \n\n\n(I know someone is gonna be like \"so you mean we should have fascists and evil people?\"  The answer is no.

As with coiling a spring and letting go, it always uncoils a little too much before settling back down. With any social/societal shift there will always be a little overcompensation, but what I've come to notice these days is that the feminist movement is straying from radicalisation. Fewer and fewer women are being belittled for choosing the traditional female path of raising children and staying at home, in fact they are encouraged to do whatever the heck they like, and that for me gives a sense of peace and that everything is finally starting to calm down a little. Of course, there are those \"radical feminists\" that are still kicking around out there, but just like that one bigoted, sexist arsehole that lives down the street, they do not represent the whole.",

Why? It was the same task! But they are lead to believe that there is a field they are naturally good or bad at.\n\nAnd of course it would be great if that wasn't the case.\nAnd of course starting a huge campaign in empowering women or at least paying them the same would be kinda cool.\nAnd of course it's \"just a shirt\".\n\u00b4But you know who started a 13-month-lasting Bus Boykott for civil rights which lead to many more Civil Rights Movements? Rosa Parks, a <b> woman </b>who just did not stand up in a bus.\n\nYou shouldn't tell yourself \"it's just this or that\" because it isn't. The world is<b>  weird</b>. The smallest actions have the largest impacts and vice versa.\u00a0\nIn the same way he would've been praised if he had worn a shirt full of female scientists like Marie Cury, he now as a grown independent man has to live with the consequences his other choice had.\u00a0\nWhat if he had worn a shirt full of female scientists? He might have inspired just one girl to join who might have found out something incredible. Or not. Who knows? But no one can say there is no chance.\n\nThis is what you have to keep in mind. Everything, every slightest positive change we can achieve, is something we hold on to.\nAnd if \"just a shirt\" matters so much to us and so little to you, would it kill you to simply not wear it in such occasions?\nIn the end, it's \"just a shirt\", right?",

The thought that women will stop pursuing their dreams because of a shirt is ridiculous and deeply sexist, but since that suggestion is made with a tone of compassion it's passable. Ultimately, when something like this happens, results in a very confused apology by the \"offender\" who learns that women are fragile so he must be careful, deepening the already existing stereotype. The same happens to women who witness the outrage and the apology, who then interiorize the same fragility.",

            "commentText": "\"What is it that I am in danger of loosing?\" WOW you made a really fantastic video. Thank-you.\nActually, I just thought of this. It is interesting how much thought women have to put into what they wear. Like, I know growing up I really had to consider the clothing choices I made before I walked out the door. \n\nThere were situations where I had to think about, is what I am wearing too risky? Is this shirt sending a bad message. Interestingly, It never seemed to matter how prudishly I dressed. Head to toe, fully covered in conservative clothing, I still was sexually harassed. I still had to face aggression. \n\nBut I just wonder if guys ever stop and think about what they are wearing. Much like women who are blamed for poor clothing choices that lead to aggression, is the concept of 'I don't have to think about what I am wearing' part of privilege?\n\nThe reason I ask this, as well, is that being part of the punk/alternative scene, I fully understood that in the early 1990's in a largely conservative town, bright blue hair with ripped jeans and confronting t-shirts is going elicit confrontation. Given the political situation of where I came from, 5 years earlier, wearing that same outfit would have had me locked up. Possibly questioned, placed under police surveillance and had a file kept on me. It is all very well for me to 'rebel\" when the risks are low. Ramp those risks up and it is not so comfortable. \n\nWhat did he think when he put that t-shirt on? Or could he afford not to think at all. When he puts that shirt on his life is not in danger. When he puts that shirt on he will not be thrown in prison. When he puts that shirt on he will not go under police surveillance and a police record will not be kept on him.   If he is out late at night and he is sexually assaulted he knows it was not because of the shirt. Or that he was \"asking for it\" because he was wearing the shirt.  \n\nHis risk for wearing the shirt? people publicly calling him out on it. hmmmm big risk! :-\\",

THAT is why I support people to wear whatever they want or however else express however they would like. What SJW morons, feminist morons and their ilk just can't seem to grasp is the concept that a reaction will come by itself when it is warranted, and requires no artificial cultural bullying.

Because people who are annoyed by the outcry of feminists/SJW's over stuff like this do not feel threatened - they simply feel annoyed, annoyed because they are witness to how many people are making unjustified and misguided remarks because of their own problems and insecurities that they have. The point in the video could maybe apply if somehow a lot of men got upset over some provocative shirt worn by a <b> woman.</b> \n\nHowever in the end both men, women and groups of people by any other definition have the capacity to feel threatened in their mind by something which would simply not be relevant if they chose to ignore it. When certain groups of people constantly display this behavior it becomes annoying to others who are exposed to it, and who can see the futility of it all.",

A shirt like that is not sexist, it is, however something unnoticeable until pointed out by someone. I have done no research on this, but I would like to know how many women planning on entering the STEM field were offended and/or discouraged from entering it. The problem with matters such as this is that we have become invested and inflamed over trivialities, one of them being this fucking shirt. It doesn't matter. It seems we are looking for something to complain about. And this was an easy target. And, perhaps, women aren't entering the field because it's not that popular a subject amongst women. Don't get me wrong, and it's not just society propagating it's control over us, but basic human nature dictates that women are naturally interested in certain subjects whilst males are interested in others. And women, wishing to enter the field, will not be discouraged by a fucking shirt. As all it is, is a printed piece of fabric, and the desire for a long term career in something you want to do would overwhelm the minor irk that a printed piece of fabric would trigger. So, all I'm trying to say is, it's a shirt, move on.",

And i don't want to become an makeup artist and noone is complaining why the vast majority of makeup artists are female. On retro perspective, why don't you complain why the ratio of college graduates is 6:4 in favor of women? That should rather be a bigger problem since college represents more a general achievement in academics than representing interest in a particular subject(like stem) \nIf you had evidence that women are less respected in that area despite same or similar results, than that is surely a problem.

One man wears a shirt with scantily clad women. Life goes on. Conversations continue progress. There are more important battles to be fought than policing peoples clothing- and I'm plainly not alone in wanting to live in a society that does such things.\n\nThe reason people fear giving an inch is because they are rightly afraid of the extremes. Feminism in the extreme blends into an anti-intellectual cult. Disavow the <b> crazy </b>(gravity is<b>  misogynist</b> and other insane tropes) and feminism becomes much easier to accept. The more people focus on asinine shit like this shirt, the more the<b>  'commo</b>n man' is alienated and driven towards whatever alternative exists.

Since i really like reading yaoi manga i found the outfit to be very cool, on the other hand however i thought to myself that it wasn't very appropiate to be wearing<b>  ga<b> y</b</b>> porn in a con where kids were around.\n\nAs<b>  a <b> g</b</b>>ay man i did not feel particularly offended nor objectified by the tshirt, but that might be because we havent been as fetishised as women have throughout history (yet) , and in our case genres like yaoi despite how unrealistic and objectifying<b>  fo<b> r</b</b>> gay men can be, it has helped to increase accepta<b> nce<b>  </b</b>>of gay relationships in media and fandoms. \n\nBut i couldnt help feeling a bit cynical about it, because even i would have felt offended if the tshirt had hentai girls instead. That's not right. Why am i ok with one and not the other? may it be because of people's tireness o<b> f femal</b>e sexual objectification made by the straight male compared to the still new and niche objectifi<b> cat<b> i</b</b>>on of gay male for female consumption?

Would I be OK with this if the roles were reversed? So if someone wore a shirt with a bunch of beefed-up cartoon action men, would that make me feel insecure? No, it wouldn't. \nIt's such an insignificant thing. I'd be more interested to know what Mike Taylor's opinion of women is. You can always tell talking to a guy if he's sexist or not by the way he talks about women, especially when there's none around. For me, if a guy in conversation refers to women as 'dumb sluts' or anything like that, that is a million times more damning than wearing that shirt.",

The artwork is high quality, the women on it are beautifully depicted - even 100% straight women are capable of looking at the female form and appreciating its beauty. WE ALL DO IT, guys - even the really prude-y girls! If I'd been standing next to that guy I would have said to him \"I LOVE your shirt!\" Does this make me a female<b>  misogynist</b>?\nAnd before we go any further, I've worked in male-dominated workplaces for most of my life - and had to put up with WAY more sexist behaviour than guys wearing 'sexually exploitative' shirts. But a shirt's easy to pick on, isn't it? You can see it and point to it and go \"There! That's a symbol of The Entire Problem - that's wha<b> t sexis</b>m looks like!\"\nBy turning such things into shorthand f<b> or sexi</b>sm - a logo <b> for misog</b>yny - we're dumbing down the problem. We need to be smarter than that. I'm personally quite insulted that anyone would assume us women would feel so intimidated by 'the implications' of a man wearing a shirt with sexy women on that we'd be put off entering the sciences as a career. REALLY? I'd be far more put off by being groped in a dingy office by a male superior, or told by an arthritic man in his late fifties that I couldn't be considered for the role he was leaving becaus<b> e \"a w</b>oman couldn't do my job,\" or that maybe I should \"smile less\" as I walked through the factory shopfloor so that the male workers \"wouldn't feel like they had to flirt\" with me. (All of which have genuinely happened to me in the past.) THESE are the kinds of reasons that REALLY explain why the numbers of women are so low in the sciences and other professions. But they require more guts and more brains to point fingers at. Way more than one man's shirt.",

Everyone is agreeing that the shirt is exploitative, the people who disagree just say they don't care.  They are fine with exploiting women because that's just the way things are and as the man said, they get pleasure from it.  They refuse to see that what might just be a t-shirt to you might be something much more to someone else.  Also, when we are talking about STEM we aren't talking about women and women's feelings about the shirt, we are talking about GIRLS and girls choosing to study something else because of a systemic problem that is typified in that shirt, such as treatment from a teacher who doesn't give girls the time of day, her relationship with boys and how a STEM career might affect that and the fact that the shirt itself made it seem like women aren't welcome in the science field in the same way that the calendars of biker babes seen in every garage I've ever been in shows they just don't welcome women.  That is the role women are allowed to have at that garage, and that's as decoration.  It's all the same thing. \n\nYes, it's just a shirt and in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter and I agree that this guy didn't deserve to get personally attacked about it.  But what is the most problematic is that so many people don't care that the shirt typifies a problem that goes much deeper in society than a shirt because they don't want to change their ways.  Changing is hard and they would rather insult people for caring to make the world better than do anything positive.  \n\nAnd fyi if you hate social justice warriors you're an asshole.  Think about what that means.  These people are fighting for social justice.  That's pretty amazing.  You might not agree with them, they might be right about the issue but wrong about the particulars, but they are fighting for what they think is right.   And if you live a democracy and you have the right to vote, you owe a social justice warrior a thanks.   So if you are a male member of nobility then you were happy as a clam before the damned SJWs showed up forcing you give people civil rights and pay them fairly, but for everyone else you have a SJW to thank for your current empowerment, empowerment you are now using to keep other people down.  That makes you a massive asshole.",

Whether it's this field, or any other professional field, it's always dedication, motivation and hard work that propel you forward, or the lack of those qualities that keeps you back. I am not giving up on having women girlfriends, because some of their feminists peers wear ridiculously stupid and sexist shirts. The thing is - everybody is free to do whatever he/she likes, as long as it's legal and wouldn't harm anyone else in a direct or indirect fashion. I never knew t-shirts to be such a dangerous weapon, even the ones with sexy women printed on them. In my opinion the modern western culture is as tolerant as it will ever get, and far more tolerant that at any other time in human history. Go a while back and one human tribe was slaying another for food, then for shoes, then for a costume, and then for a dollar. And now, since we ran out of awful things to be offended from, some individuals are getting offended by words. Sure, words could be bad. But other, troubled individuals, are being offended by what's on a shirt. I don't know how entitled is that, but the word we are seraching for is probably quite. Rant over.",

(hyperbole) :D\n\nNow I know I took this way to far, but my point is simple: If everyone can do as they want, because we are free to do as we want, as long as we don't insite violence or infringe other peoples rights, then why can't men (a lot of individual people) choose to objectivy women in some areas? That is legaly speeking ok.\n\nAnalogy: 10 unrelated people tell a person walking down the streat at diffrent times that they look like s***. => That is not mobbing, because it would only be mobbing if they had all planed to do that together. If it were mobbing, it could be brought to court, but as it issent => STFU about it. It is ok for everyone to do that, even if it is an asshowl move.",

Perhaps a better phrase would be \"alpha speech\" (rather than \"hate speech\"), or \"superiority crime\" (rather than \"hate crime\")? \n\nI wonder if there is a suitable reward that can match or exceed the pleasure of exerting one's dominance, and if that may be a more effective tool for combating bigotry than merely hating it back?  \n\nWhat can someone do in the context of a situation like shirt-gate to be praiseworthy, and what would the appropriate accolade or response be?\n\nNot for <b> nothing </b>but maybe Mel Brooks was right - that the best tool for handling hatred is to turn that hatred into the butt of a joke.

To me, this suggests that maybe we've gone to far in trying to uplift them. Thoughts?",

It actually makes me angry how I was able to understand that I, being white, was oppressing poc, and how it didn't took that much out of me to not make use of my privileges, and yet lots of men are not even willing to realise that THIS MATTERS. Anyways, absolutely loved the video.",

Keep in mind the right to wear revealing clothing, Cross dress, who they can marry,  drawing a picture of  a person, Drink from the same water fountain as you or even saying something like the word Pregnant on TV are some of the things that upset people and there were laws restricting these things and we fought against that. \n\nSo I can see why people on both sides get upset, but these are just my views and hope they offend everyone :D",

So I'm going to play Devil's Advocate here and ask, does appreciating or admiring an image of <b> sexual </b>expression automatically constitute oppression and/or perpetuate exploitation by default?\n\nCase study: I see a seductive photo shoot or advertisement with a model, done completely of her free will, who I think is stunningly gorgeous in a<b>  sexual</b> way. Now, I'm not about to go out and rape the next girl I see. I under no circumstances believe she should be paid less than a male counterpart doing the same job. I don't believe her opportunities should be restricted due to he<b> r gende</b>r or that she should be pigeon-holed solely to similar lines of work. I don't believe that it would be fair if she was presented with no opportunity to make a living, other than by appearing in sexy photo shoots. I absolutely don't view her as an object, I see her as an attracti<b> ve wom</b>an expressing her sexuality. I understand that there are many other facets that complete t<b> hat wo</b>man as a person, be it intellectually, emotionally, spiritually, altruistically, etc, but at this point I can only appreciate her physical beauty/sexuality that I naturally find attractive. What does that make me? \n\nAnother question I have is, what counts more? A person's freedom to be able to express themselves sexually or how offended some people might get by <b> that se</b>xual expression?\nSomeone offend<b> ed by s</b>exual images can easily turn away, but would it be morally right to stop individuals creating such consented content? We know sexuality comes in many different forms and not everyone shares the same tastes, but as long as it's not harming anyone then it should be respected.\n\nAre we on course to creating a society so sterile, sensitively fragile, and devoid of emotion that we'll no longer be able to revel in openly expressed sexuality? That would be a travesty <b> as the </b>sexual diversity and expression found within people (everyone) is one of the most beautiful things about humanity. \n\nWhat if the sexuality itself is not the issue, but how it's being interpreted and used by certain sections of society? Is eradication and hyper-sensitivity really the solution then or would that create a paradox of reverse oppression? <b> Call m</b>e crazy, but I'm of the belief that educating people on how to deal with all forms of sexuality would go further than a campaign of censorship driven by the minority who i<b> nterpre</b>t sexual expression as an avenue for social dominance.",

I do have to say, as someone who's wife is a chemical engineer and being chemist myself, I have to say I think your argument comes from one of ignorance on this issue as you aren't active in the STEM field yourself. Having been embroiled in STEM for going on a decade now, I can say that it's a woman's world today. My wife, and my female classmates who graduate have much more opportunity in the job market compared to men in America at least. Now, since I took on bigger job with worse hours and higher investment of my time I've since been able to make more money than my wife for the first time in our relationship. It's not because I'm a man that this is so, over half of the lab I work in is women, it's because I had to take a harder job to make more money. My wife is content at her job while I competitively sought more opportunities. We don't have kids so both of us are free to pursue our careers to our leisure, but there is a quantifiable difference in the ambitions and desires that I and my wife share. She's happy where she is making less money with a generally higher earning degree than mine, and I want to go out and conquer the world so my opportunity increases and hers stays the same. I think people need to look at these issues not from a reactionary perspective but an experiential one. And in my experience, there no quantifiable evidence that suggests that your assertions are factual, but rather, they are hypothetical.",

Women are less likely to choose these professions because indeed they don't want to, but studies show that when they do, they are more likely to be accepted. Also what about the statistics which show women dominating pedagogical fields and medicine? Is that <b> sexism </b>against men? Also are you implying that women will hesitate entering Stem research because of a shirt? I do not think that women are weak and to imply that is deeply troubling. Family and education influence people not shirts.Yes, we should encourage children to enter their preferred professions regardless of<b>  gender</b> but if they are intimidated by a shirt depicting fictional sexy women in comics? Well, maybe they are not the best people for this job.\n\nAlso why aren't you and feminists describing the lack of representation of women in dangerous workplaces a<b> s sexis</b>m? Logging workers, fishers, roofers, refuse and recyclable material collectors. These professions have the highest workplace accidents and deaths and are all dominated by men? Also do not ignore the fact that women are the most educated demographic group. \u039fh the hypocrisy. Male privilege at its best right? Also the irony? The infamous shirt was a gift from his wife.  \n\nPlease do not speak about subjects without doing the proper research first.

The problem now is that idealists want to make use of one without accepting the other. If you want to argue that stem numbers are a cultural created situation that could be different, you also have to accept that the shirt effect is cultural created and needs to be unlearned. so yeah, if you want to be liberal, dont be a dick about a shirt, but be invested in teaching CHILDREN about equality",

If Kim K feels empowered by expressing her sexuality there is absolutely <b> nothing </b>wrong with that, however the issue occurs when when the female body is commodified for the consumption of men. The issue with the over sexualization of women is that it's dehumanizing. It reduces a<b>  woman</b> to an object o<b> f sexua</b>l desire. It's the difference between being a human being in touch with their sexuality and being<b>  a s</b>ex object. I don't know that displays of sexuality lower discourse though. I don't think banning expressions of sexuality does anyone any good, but it's important to think about how those expressions are used and who has the power.",

I know I might be shouting into a void now but I think the whole lack of women in STEM will be fixed gradually. While we see a divide now, within a few generations these <b> gender </b>norms that are lasting from bygone times while fade further and further into antiquity and I feel that wearing a shirt wont stop that. What I am worried about is the pleasure that you mentioned not just in the traditional way but also in a reverse sense. There must be a sense of pleasure felt by the people demanding that these types of images be taken down when they eventually are. I worry that free expression might be damaged by these people and the pleasure they seek.",

I also agree that such things are probable in negatively affecting the self-esteem of young women and how, on the merit of valuing women's worth in society alone, wearing a shirt like that is best avoided.  However, I cannot agree with your conclusions or by what means you got yourself there.  Evan, is it not obvious now the questions you were begging these three years later?  How, in fact, feminism widely came out in favor of Kim Kardashian and what you did here is considered by your this very narrative as slut-shaming?  The depictions on Matt's shirt were not unlike Miley Cyrus's at the time.  Did she disuade women from entering entertainment or singing?  And now we have proof that Miley wore such images not unlike a shirt herself, that she can easily slip in and out of.  Were her images empowering or disempowering?  Or was she glorifying a type of sexuality far more damaging than this shirt, an identity that other <b> woman </b>cannot so easily change in their lives because they don't have the resources to do so.  However, the narrative you used here would never be applied to her.  Why is that?",

They're only 1% of garbage collectors and sewage workers, but those jobs are icky and gross and no one will think they're smart for doing them, so no one cares.\n\nIf you were consistent about expecting everything to have 50-50 representation, you'd be downright neurotic.  Let people live with the life choices they've made.

I thought it was a field dominated by women until I discovered the statistics of just how few women are working in the fields of science and math. None of those girls persued science. One of them, a damn genius I couldn't compete with, went on to get a mathmatics degree. Where does she work? She's the drive through order taker at our town's mcdonalds. Constantly criticized by her boss for not being friendly and smiling.",

It says that he wants to reduce women to cartoons, that he finds women inherently aggressive and punishing and that they make him feel small and a victim. It is what is behind most <b> misogynist </b>behaviors, a fear that women are going to beat them, that they are inherently superior. We ain't. I have been living with this for sixty plus years and am so disappointed to see it still coming up, still being relevant. Pubescent girls are told to wear golf shirts and baggy khakis to class because anything else distracts the boys (hate to tell ya, but the abaya results in as much<b>  sexual</b> harassment of women in public as do short-shorts. An Abaya is <b> a blac</b>k burqa without the eye screen.) Girls and science - we LOVE science. We tend to be very good at science. Heck, chemistry is cooking you can't eat. Quantum mechanics is right up our alleys - we are not naturally linear thinkers and qm is a balancing act of plates on poles. In four or five dimensions. Heck, bring it on! But the erosion starts with breast buds and our first periods, with teachers and parents directing us to make it easier on the boys. With teachers who are still more likely to wait for a boy to raise his hand before allowing a girl to answer. With publications that won't take our work without a man's name over ours. (This even happens in fiction publishing - Nora Roberts publishes her science fiction mysteries under a pseudonym that <b> is gend</b>er ambiguous. Rowling was told to not use her first name because no one would buy that kind of fiction fro<b> m a wo</b>man.) It wasn't until 1957 that women could sign for a loan, be the name on a mortgage or car title. I see signs everywhere of politicians and other groups trying to push women back that way. It is what is behind the anti-immigration sentiment - a fear of having to compete.",

It's only discrimination when people decide that it is, and that just makes me question whether people aren't being a bit too sensitive at this point. I could understand if he wore a shirt that said \"WHORE\" or one with PoC that said \"N***\" then that'd be a clear sign, but a shirt with some good-looking, objectified women? Come on.

You seem steadfast in your belief that the differences between men and women are based on socialization alone, but this just isn't reflected by statistics. As societies get more equal, and men and women have more leeway in choosing careers, the gap between men and women in STEM gets wider. This happens across the board. Why, in societies where they have more options about what career to go into, would women choose to go into STEM less unless they really didn't want that in the first place?",

I wasn't aware of shirtgate until now, but I am not personally stunned by it or consciously discouraged from participating in STEM. As a female, though, I feel part of that lack of emotional response is a cultural conditioning around that sort of issue. I feel as though I'm used to seeing images like that all over. They don't consciously rattle me too often, but I think a large part of the feminist movement around stuff like that is the movement to take away that sort of layer of apathy. I think the movement is important because it's a way for women to turn the tables and declare that it shouldn't be that way: that women should be conciously bothered because otherwise it gets subconsciously internalized. Also, dear intellectual Nerdwriter, I think the large portion of people who would benefit from your point won't try hard enough to understand it or will disregard the main message. I hope not. Thank you for your wonderfully crafted essays! I am in awe of your analytical mind.",

I almost couldn't get past 3:36; opinions are fine and dandy but the build-up of that music just makes everything you say sound ridiculously condescending.\n\nI believe there are legitimate <b> gender </b>inequality issues present in STEM but not so severe such that wearing the wrong shirt is considered important, especially in first-world countries where often girls are being motivated wherever they can to pursue a STEM major.  As a female studying and working in CS/Engineering in a first-world country, I cannot stand this constant babying of girls here--often certain opportunities are given (especially in tech) exclusively to women and under-represented minorities (i.e. non-Asians and non-Caucasians) while we are in university.  All they've done for me is distance myself further from my male peers who feel slighted at the idea that they have a smaller shot at certain internships and opportunities just because I was born the right<b>  sex</b>, despite having a weaker resume.\n\nThere may definitely be some biases at the graduate and post-graduate level that I'm not aware of so I can only acknowledge that they may exist; I don't know enough to comment further.  But my perspective is that if you can be so easily deterred from studying STEM because of someone's choice of clothing, then maybe you shouldn't study STEM in the first place.<b> \n\nSexis</b>m in STEM is complicated and goes beyond \"STEM hates women\".  I'm sick of discussions about this issue being focused around shirts and toys.  We could be helping elimina<b> te sexi</b>sm effectively and where it's readily present but instead we're jeering at people's choice of sweaters and character models in video games?  What the hell?\n\nSorry if I sound overtly aggressive.  I'm young and there are definitely a lot of issues revolving aro<b> und sex</b>ism that I might just not have lived long enough to experience.  Your video and holier-than-thou attitude just reminded me how I'm just tired of us women being babied and protected against the big scary real world and told how repressed we are again and again.  \n\nYour film analysis videos are still pretty damn good though.",

So he didn't choose the shirt or if to wear it.\n\nAnd YES, I do feel threatened by feminists and SJWs, my liberal ideology of equal rights and progressive values is being severely undermined by the very people most actively advocating for such.

Take it from a 17-year <b> old </b>in a public science high school from a third-world country trying to pursue a career in physics, which is arguably one of the most male-dominated fields in research. In my year, the ratio of boys to girls is two is to one. Overall, there are more males than females in my school. This can mean that when there are issues affecting the student body, such as, let's say, overpopulation (because our country had just adjusted to a K-12 curriculum and they were not able to build additional dorms because of budget constraints), the males would be given a higher priority than females. In our campus, there are 2 dorms each for males and females. For the past four years the females only occupied one, so the following school year, when the student population was expected to increase by 25%, they decided that to give the unused dormitory to the boys. Somewhat reasonable based on the logistics, however, the girls were either forced to cram their already full dormitory to accommodate the new tenants. Some of the girls were forced to vacate the dorm, while the others, like myself, were forced into smaller, more crowded rooms. Unfortunately, the stress accumulated due to the taxing requirements accompanied by the new, less-conducive-to-studying atmosphere of the room. My<b>  mental</b> health degraded and I started have panic attacks. I was not able to attend classes for a long period of time--long enough for the higher-ups to consider my dismissal from school. Take into account that I had been performing exceedingly well before I developed severe anxiety. I was one of the very few in our year who was consistently in the honor roll. In the end, the school gave me an ultimatum: either catch up on everything that I missed (which was half a year of work) within two weeks, repeat a year, or withdraw. I chose the last option for the sake of m<b> y menta</b>l stability. \n\nMine was not an isolated case. At least 20 of my batchmates also developed some form of (clinically-diagnose<b> d) ment</b>al illness. Most of us were girls. Our already-dwindling female population in the science high school decreased all the more. Even a close (male) friend of mine would tell me that (non-verbatim) ours is a male-dominated field and always will be because men are really better at math than women. He would tell me this when I ask about his math competitions abroad and inquire on the percentage of females competing and winning the event.\n\nNot to worry, though. I still plan on pursuing a career in physics and I don't think I would consider any other path than that.",

Yes it is unfortunate that more women do not go into STEM fields, and that the ones who do go into them are taken less seriously. But just placing those numbers next to a feminism-related story does <b> nothing </b>to establish a causal relationship. Numbers only add credibility to an argument if you know how to use them.\nI think there is also something to be said about the \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" mentality in modern feminism in regards to sexuality. Some will condemn it as inherently degrading, while others herald it as empowering. The<b>  woman</b> who designed that shirt as a gift for the scientist and encouraged him to wear it on air as a promotion for her designs most probably belonged to the latter of those mentalities. I wonder how she feels about all of this",

            "commentText": "You mentioned that women get more degrees but you failed to mention what areas of study those degrees are in. I won't use the word 'propaganda' like a lot of other people would, but it's hard to take an argument seriously when in misses out key facts. Also, without even going into the fact that you provided no evidence for it, your assertion that prejudice comes from pleasure and/or being threatened is somewhat incorrect and only applies to a very select few of the people you're targeting. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy your videos and herald many of the causes you support, but this video is disappointing. On top of this, you're focussing on what is ultimately a non-issue. Criticizing this one guy for his choice of shirt isn't helping when there are actual instances of the abuse of women happening every day. Surely targeting those cases would be more helpful to the cause?",

            "commentText": "So rather than consider other points of view such as: the main reason why women don't go into STEM fields is because they demand a lot of work, and when such work isn't necessary for\u00a0a group of people\u00a0to live, such as having a men (or just\u00a0their money) to take care of them, then more often than not people of\u00a0that group\u00a0are simply not gonna work that hard.\n\nOr another point: <b> Sexism </b>is rooted in putting men and women in particular roles and circumstances, particularly having men do the work that needs doing and having women keep safe and rear the coming generation. The reason why we see women as weaker and incompetent compared to men is to keep them in the safe parts of society, which is why we also tend to give them much more sympathy than we would with men (this is why we can have a<b>  woman</b> get away with trying to slit a cop's throat wit<b> h nothin</b>g more than a slap on the wrist). So when people complain about something as benign as a shirt because it supposedly oppresses women, they're basically playing into the roles that kee<b> ps sexi</b>sm going.\n\nInstead, you'd much rather paint anti-SJWs simply as people who don't want their power taken away...\n\nFuck you and the horse you rode in on. Oh wait, you are the horse, and the one riding you are feminists. And if you think that last statement was an unfair take on you, then maybe you should look at your take on us for a change.",

You have attempted the definition of terms, impossed definitions on these via rhetorocal order, and have used them consistently as best you could. You have often begun with questions. You have kept the focus on plain logic: have maintained strictly the venerable method of pure Rationalism; pure Rationalism being the only possible way of justifying pure Empiricism, truly the only method used by all demagogues  on every side of every debate ever. The demagogue's method works thus: The demagogue speaks, \"We observe this, we call it that (we have snuck in a value judgement). And we say that this is having that effect--this effect of that being axiomatically bad. . . Therefore. We command you. [Pause]. Smash. It!\"\n\nThe method of the video is merely a fairer version of the above. \n\nI am happy there is so much capable argument, and on a democratic scale. That is something to write poetry about 1000 years in the future to honor an ancient golden <b> age.</b>\n\nDo you think Athens was quiet? Was France's, then, a quiet riot? \"Paris, Venice, the litter of Italian republics. . .When they made these things they were boiling with revolutions.\"\nAmerica has been quiet for too long. Blast the brazen horn! Find your manhood. Regret that you have found it! \nAnd defend feminity, whatever it may be.\n\nThat was a bit of fun. But with a point. Maybe we should discover what masculinity and femininity really are before we start prescribing treatments. What are the sexes, are they intrinsic? If not, we must decide if we want make femininity more like masculinity. If so, then what does respect for women really mean? \nObjectification was never really the question. An ancient Christian may have scolded a certain man that wearing a cloak patterned with erotic women was wrong and then covered her hair. A more extreme female femnist may tell you so and then bare her breasts. \nIt is perhaps a difference in method indicating a disagreement about fundamental things.",

Now, why aren't you complaining about the falling male college graduation rates? Also, the Labor Department, under Obama administration, already concluded that the wage gap is entirely explained by choice, not <b> sexism.</b> There have been laws in place since the 60's that prevent compensating women unequally for same work. If corporations could pay women less, then they would only be hiring women. Now, let's talk about some real examples of<b>  sexism</b>: 90% of workplace related deaths occur to men. Men are forced to register for selective services and potentially be drafted for a war, as they were in Vietnam, where men were forcefully flown into a foreign country to die in a rain of napalm and bullets. That's a possibility men have to contend with every minute of their lives. While women are assured that, in case of war, they will be allowed to stay home. Also, men get their genitals mutilated at birth, occasionally resulting in infant death.",

There have been countless studies which show that men are naturally better at maths and sciences and that women are better at languages. So naturally more men gravitate to STEM fields amd it's a good thing that they do, simply because they are better at it and we would want to have the best scientists we could have in each field. The fact that women are less likely to make it into peer review can be explained through the bellcurve of probability of intelligence. While women cluster around average intelligence, men are more spread out, which means there are way more male idiots but also way more geniuses. Since it's those geniuses that produce a vast number of important scientific discovery it is only natural that men are \"overrepresented\" in peer reviewed articles.\n\nAll of this has absolute<b> ly nothi</b>ng to do with cultural norms<b>  or sex</b>ism.

You might want to insert an intro saying \"for those who don't microscopically examine every transient meme, this is what Vox and the Huffington Post are obsessed with this week\". Now just glancing at that guy and his shirt, it seems to me pretty obvious what's going on here. This guy is a nerd and has always been a nerd. When he was growing up, he had a fascination for the abstract and otherwordly. He spent much of his time marvelling about the stars and solving maths problems. The other kids in the school laughed at him and ostracised him. His social life was confined to the chess club because his priorities were different to most people's. The girls were not interested in this nerd; most were more interested in the popular jocks in the class. Meanwhile, this guy was reading comic books. So what does this shirt mean to him? It means \"comic books are cool\". What does it mean to feminists and people who write for the Huffington Post? \"I am enforcing my violent, patriarchal dominance so women can't study physics.\" This is utterly delusional. Listen: People who are professional astrophysicists don't pay attention to, or even notice, other people's clothes (unless they are extremely garish and feature something they're interested in, like comic book references). They are absolutely obsessed with their field, to the exclusion of almost everything else, including other people's perceptions of their appearance. If you don't have that obsession, you probably don't have what it takes to be a top scientist. If seeing a nerd in a comic book shirt is enough to discourage you from studying STEM, consider whether you have the sort of laser-focussed obsession with physics that the job requires. Would I wear that shirt? Hell no. But for Christ's sake, you're microanalysing the dress sense of a guy who buys his shirts at a comic book shop.",

It's easy to hate on some guy for his shirt and feel good because you're \"fighting against <b> sexism\"</b> or whatever. It's hard to actually fight for women's rights whether it's the wage gap, abortion rights,<b>  sexual</b> assault you name it.

Marie Curie, for example, was one of the most important scientists in history. But, neurologically speaking, women operate differently than men. Men's brains tend to navigate structural problems better, while women's tend to navigate interpersonal problems better. Not that this matters, but it does help to explain the lack of women in STEM fields. Assuming oppression without evidence does not. It's okay for women to be scientists, and it's okay for them to not. It's okay for men to be nurses, counselors, and elementary school teachers, and it's okay for them to not.

People are entitled to their emotions, but emotions are not facts. And just because you FEEL that a certain situation, person or object is \"wrong\", \"bad\" or \"sexist\" doesn\u00b4t necessarily make it so. \nApart from the histrionics and often misplaced outrage and consequences that follow, the SJW movement as a whole does something worse: It often completely removes the focus from REAL issues that ACTUALLY need solving. The more time we (us, the media, politicians etc) spend debating very small or even completely fake issues, the less time we spend on things that could have made a difference in areas where feminists and the SJWs (allegedly) want to see change. \n\nWanna stop <b> sexism?</b> How about the SJW and feminists protest the Kim Kardashians of this world? How about challenging the women of Instagram, FB and the plethora of other social media, who unapologetically use<b>  sex</b> to promote themselves and/or get a shortcut to the good life? How about being pissed off at female pornstars for making it super easy for all men to be sexist and objectifying women?\nBut no. Because the root of the problem is an underlying hypocrisy: If <b> a woma</b>n makes bad choices \"t<b> he Patriarc</b>hy made me do it!\". Unless she adamantly stands by her choices, because then she\u00b4s a \"str<b> ong wo</b>man\", or \"a sell-out\" depending on how SJW you are. And the pendulum of hypocrisy keeps swinging merrily: \nWh<b> en a w</b>oman strips naked and shows her tits to get attention, she is \"a strong, indepe<b> ndent </b>woman\".\nWhen a man stares at her titties, he is a misogynistic, sexist pig who objectifies women. Seems to me that (according to a lot of feminists and SJWs) women demand equal rights, as long as they can reserve the right to be a victim when it suits them. \nSeems to me, that \"equal rights\" these da<b> ys has n</b>othing to do with rights, and everything to do with entitlement.\nBut let\u00b4s not get into that issue.\nInstead, let\u00b4s focus on a man with a shirt.",

Feminists seem to argue that when women in a culture are continually sexualised in a certain manner (objectification) their perceived non-sexual values are diminished. If this is correct it stands to reason that if all women in a culture are not as valued as men for attributes such as intelligence, decisiveness, etc. that women would not enjoy equal opportunities in many areas. So, it seems that responses to this controversy are predicated on the belief or disbelief that the kind of sexualisation apparent on Matt Taylor's shirt would precipitate such an effect. In order for that to be answered one would have to have a great depth of knowledge of the psychology of sexualization and its consequences socially, something which I, the authors of \"think pieces\" and other laymen lack.",

Sexualized imagery is only hurtful if it's the only message women receive: IE \"You can be this, and only this, if you want to be desired.\" I think that's both unfair and untrue. I think any modern movement should be less concerned with tearing down sexualized imagery and more concerned with promoting imagery that celebrates the diversity of choice that women could have provided society gave them un-biased opportunities (it currently doesn't). The problem of sexualized imagery is that by attacking it, you're just introducing more shame onto women by telling them that it's not ok to be attractive. I'd like to see society change in a way that is more permissive and hands-off, so that men and women are free to live however they decide without consequence or fear of resentment from other human beings. Controlling a person's behavior by ridiculing their <b> sexual </b>identity, needs, or expression, is as<b>  old</b> as agriculture and getting kinda stale, yo.

Feminists, and I believe there are many women with these bullshit ideas, seek 'equality' only when it suits them. They bitch about everything because they want to have their cake and eat it too so I am not surprised a stupid T-Shirt is controversial. It is annoyance because they want special privileges because they are women at the expense of  men, that's fair to them and all of this is out of control. \n\nIn the previous decades we agreed on most things and kept quiet because there was some argument there but now it is out of control. One of the main reasons we amended laws and put up with silly hysterics was because we sought partners and wanted harmony so we compromised. Today its far worse, they don't know what they want at all. Sadly, they don't want partners but want to work and compete with men, not raise families and dress promiscuously to 'express themselves' but not for men at all. Its sad and society is getting worse thanks to them.",

It never made stay away from STEM fields, I'm a biologist now and it has never occurred to me that wearing skimpy clothes can't coexist with science. That stuff doesn't even make any sense to me, maybe it's a US thing. Do you mean what a male scientist wears on his shirt suggests something about what women should do about science or clothes or what... Maybe if you Americans weren't so obsessed with demonizing sexuality then you would realize that looking sexy or wearing skimpy clothing isn't a bad thing. At least it isn't seen as demeaning or bad in Europe. Women wearing skimpy clothing is all about empowerment and the right to do so.",

When a hard working, intelligent, dedicated, and apparently nice guy like Matt Taylor can be brought to tears by self-anointed moral crusaders because of a shirt, we have ventured into dangerous territory. You talk about how racists and sexists and the like derive pleasure from their sense of superiority and power over others, and you are absolutely correct, but this is the same thing happening with people who go around saying that everything under the sun is somehow prejudiced and harmful. They are taking pleasure in asserting their dominance over others by shaming them, turning them into a pariah, over barely perceptible slights. This culture of hyper-sensitivity pushes society further from the ideal that its adherents, as well as many of its victims, desire. In hindsight, we can see that this is exactly what happened with the Clinton campaign and why it was such a failure. More than any candidate in the last two decades, Clinton spent much of her time campaigning attempting to shame the opposition, and the results have clearly been disastrous, having the exact opposite effect to what was intended. This is what we were afraid of losing; the once liberally minded, socially conscious, free-speech advocating left has been corrupted by this authoritarian and hateful ideology that is no more self-aware of its own hypocrisy and the harm it does than it claims Taylor was of his shirt and its supposed detrimental effect on girls' ambitions.\n\nRegarding differences in male and female career choices, and <b> gender </b>norms in general: there is a plethora of evidence from multiple lines of scientific inquiry that supports the hypothesis that there is a biological basis for the observed differences in male and female preferences. Obviously, this doesn't say anything about whether or not there is<b>  sexual</b> discrimination in STEM fields, but it should at least make one pause and think critically when presented with some sex-based statistics so as to avoid committing a base-rate fallacy error.",

He was used as a scapegoat for an imporant subject matter that truly affects millions, but that truly has <b> nothing </b>to do with wearing such kinds of shirts, or even liking such kinds of aesthetics. Dr Taylor deserves a global apology, especially now, when halfwitt public officials like trump are elected for office. A man's taste is not to be put in question, so far as he is not deliberately hurting anybody, your capacity to feel hurt by others is no justification for acting against them and making them feel hurt in return. A good man cried, and felt deep regret and sorrow and shame for just being himself. Dr Taylor deserves better. The scietntific community deserves better. Our children, who want to live in a free world where personal tastes are accepted if not necesarily shared, deserve better.  Best wishes.",

They're \"smarter\" and \"get paid less\" right....wrong. The fact is that women don't want to go to science fields and the wage gap is a myth. They choose other career paths. Most science programs are funded thru the government and there's women in congress and in the senate running the government so opportunities are there. Same with construction, there perhaps up to 10% of women in all fields of construction but why isn't there more women in these fields??? Because the truth is that women don't wanna do dirty men jobs.

That should a <b> woman </b>have several<b>  sexual</b> encounters over the course of her life made her a whore. That <b> a woma</b>n's greatest contribution to life was being a mother/wife and that she should have no other aspirations, especially not those that were suited for men. The more I thought about it the more I realised I was a misandrist. None of those ideas were really based on anything, but instead seemed to have been absorbed through societal ideals and enforced by an insecurity I wasn't aware of, that used other women as means for poorly building on my self worth through an ill educated sense of morality. I only wish I had realised these things about myself sooner but that I will as time goes on, question long standing ideas for their merit as opposed to the pleasure I get from them, especially if the end result is an attempt to take away the ability for others to live their lives the way they see fit. I endeavour to never again accept an idea without looking at it from as many angles as possible before making a decision. This I can at least pass on to my daughter in hopes that she will be more compassionate and understanding of others than I have been.",

Yeah, I think the shirt is a part of negative images of women, and yeah, I do think it has an effect on how people think (and before anyone says that it infantilizes women to say that they're influenced by things like that, everyone is influenced by their environment; there's no such thing as a personality or choice that isn't). People don't realize the influence because they take it for granted, but I do think it matters.\n\nBut this was just one instance; the guy wore the wrong shirt, and it wasn't great, but he probably just didn't think about it. He absolutely did get skewered, if not here, then plenty of other places. And that's ridiculous; everyone makes gaffes from time to time. The thing to do is talk to the person; usually, they'll apologize, be more careful in the future, and everyone moves on with their lives. And honestly, one shirt choice is the least of reasons why women might feel unwelcome in STEM fields. Why was everyone suddenly attacking him? \n\nI'll tell you why: bandwagon mentality. It became something to talk about and have an opinion on. And people felt self-righteous about those opinions, on both sides. But I think THAT is the main reason people don't want to hear it: it's less about talking about attitudes toward women, and more about trying to make yourself look more enlightened than everyone else. It's true that people don't want to give things up, but when you bring things up in a more down-to-earth context, they might disagree, but they're a lot less likely to get hostile.I actually think one of the biggest problems facing modern Feminism is its own sanctimonious attitude; <b> nothing </b>makes people shut down faster than acting like you're better and/or smarter than them. Fortunately, I do think there's a movement against that trend, with people saying things more like, hey, I'm not trying to say you're bad or stupid; this just bothers me, and here's why. I don't even think you have to give up everything that has some<b>  sexism</b> in it... but that's a different subject.",

            "commentText": "I've been ruminating on a term that has become ubiquitous on youtube in as diverse discourses as politics, sports, gaming, and flaming. That term is being someone's \"bitch.\" Although it is used to describe the dominance of one allegedly straight man (Putin) over another allegedly straight man (Trump), it originates from, and correct me if I get this wrong, the disempowered position of a female dog beneath the male dog that is humping her. The use of this term even by what I believe are enlightened, progressive people perpetuates, I believe, the rampant verbal sexualization of all competition. I believe the term, being someone's bitch, has extended into the <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>community as well so that in those relationships, too, instead of venturing into new, egalitarian modes of communion simply parrot all inside traditional heterosexual relations that keeps the politics of power alive. Women use this terminology as much as men, and never before have I heard articulated a reason for its popularity until I watched this video: the pleasure of domination. So long as we slice up domination and focus on all the \"isms\" lik<b> e racis</b><b> m, sexi</b>sm, etc. We keep the lens focused on the victims instead of what inspires a perpetrator to act out aggression. I think it is indeed this pleasure of domination, which is reinforced in myriad ways throughout our culture, so much so that we don't blink when we hear of someone being another's \"bitch.\" It's a sort of pathology of competition, the threads of which are so woven into the fabric of our society as to appear, as you say, invisible. To this day, for example, few people know who Lynn Margulis is or the era of symbiogenesis she introduced to evolutionary theory, effectively bringing to an end the view that survival meant solely competition. Our vocabulary egregiously lags, ever tapping into medieval concepts of brute dominance when in fact at every turn, cooperation has been shown to be as much a key to success as any other. Some people might see a shirt like that as a bunch of admittedly over-sexualized \"kick-ass bitches\" and admire those images of women as somehow empowering to the female. Some people might see a shirt like that as objectifying women, belittling the significance of their intellect, and blaming the lack of women in important STEM fields on the biases that are obviously alive and well. Then there are others who might question why it is seen as admirable for women to enter the traditionally male arena of competition, e<b> ven sex</b>ual competition, testosterone hype, and the politics of dominance. Do claiming those things add one iota of freedom and empowerment to the state of women? How can it when we still have in our language terminology like \"being one's bitch,\" which immediately connotes that the traditional position of the female is that of disempowerment? Do we then somehow empower that position? Or do we summarily divorce it from its origin? I don't know. But it seems to me an important question.",

            "commentText": "I suppose the point I raise has already been raised ad nauseam sempiternam, but... just on the off chance that someone may not have heard it, or may want to engage... the question to me is the correlation. When you claim that Matt's t-shirt is 'part of a culture' that 'influences women away from STEM' (Mike's apt comparison with the colors of poisonous frogs sort of summarizes it rather well), what I miss is the evidence other than the fact that there are fewer women than men in STEM fields. As the saying goes, correlation does not imply causation, and one should always be distrustful of easy \"just-so\" stories. The truth to me is that we still don't have a good science of \"social engineering\" that can really answer the question, 'what is the expected impact of this or that element (be it a work of art, an idea, a tendency, a meme, an ideology, a scientific fact...) on society as a whole?' To pretend that we do -- that there is a simple causal relation between \"sexualized images of women (or men) in the media\" and <b> sexism,</b> for instance, because \"it's obvious\" -- begs the question. There is research supporting this idea, and there is research supporting the opposite idea -- at best this is far from being a settled question.\n\nBut, as you said... the dirty secret of<b>  sexism</b> -- and of ant<b> i-sexis</b>m -- is that it's a pleasurable way of asserting dominance. If a group can dominate the narrative -- \"sexualized images\" <b> > \"sexi</b>sm\" -- and silence other narratives, or at least make them avoidable for thinking people... then what have we escaped from, really? Certainly not oppression, as it is now understood<b> .\n\n\"Patriar</b>chy\" is not in itself a bad concept; like, say, \"primitive society\", it is simply trying to capture some sort of anthropological intuition about society. It's the use that is made of it that can be, and often is, cringeworthy. \"Primitive society\", which could have been simply a technical term, became offensive because of its use to justify evolutionist views of human groups, thus placing higher importance and higher worth on our own group -- the danger of bad ethnocentrism (there is a good ethnocentrism, but that's a topic for a different post) is quite obvio<b> us. \"Patria</b>rchy\" as a justification for anything that is seen as (as opposed to being proven to be) bad for women (or men<b>  as a g</b>ender, lately) similarly begs the question. Boogeymen never really explain anything, because they don't exist. A number of things that are bad for wome<b> n as a </b>gender (or for men, for that matter) probably have much deeper (and surprising) roots than the i<b> dea of \"pat</b>riarchy\" gives them credit for. Here, as was the case for 'primitive society\", the danger of (over)simplification and reification -- of assumi<b> ng that \"pa</b>triarchy\" is something material, like a bunch <b> of se</b>xist pigs hiding somewhere and controlling everything, rather than a complex and basically still unexplored system of relations -- may end up with t<b> his word, \"</b>patriarchy\", becoming similarly dangerous and ultimately counterproductive. As I watch would-be SJWs consistently misrepresent problems and their solutions in the internet, the end<b>  result -- </b>'patriarchy' been reduced to just a word used to silence certain people, e.g. white men, which is what MRA's are trying to do to it -- seems woefully unavoidable.",

None of this stuff is \"cultural stereotypes\", or \"oppression\" but evolutionary psychology.\n\n Men and women are objectively, scientifically, on average, different. This is proven. And the reasons for it, <b> sex </b>hormones, are proven in their effect on behaviour. \n\nIts \"women and children first\" because men lay down their lives, instinctively - testosterone makes men protective of women and children.\u00a0The reason why- if you can't work that out, go back to school (its offspring survival).\u00a0Men work longer hours at work, have longer tenure, because they are providers, same reason as above. Both things are built into testosterone. So are a whole host of other evolutionary behaviours. \n\nWomen want to attract the best possible mate, they are the choosey ones, they aim up the social chain. Pregnancy has a high cost, so mate selection is a priority. Men are concerned about genes and health, so a display of health and genes is employed to attract the best possible mate. So they sexualize _themselves_. Repeat, women sexualize themselves. For their own\u00a0_advantage_. \n\nThey are<b>  sexual</b>, and social. This is built into oxytocin and estrogen. It is why less women enter stem fields, because women are people orientated on average, rather than thing oriented on average, like men. Hence, they CHOOSE, teaching, nursing, secretary etc. Because o<b> f se</b>x hormones. These are more rewarding socially. Not everyone thinks about dollar bills or quarks, or equations all day, and that doesn't make someone less valid. \n\nThere is no \"cultural oppression\" o<b> r \"gend</b>er stereotype threat\", there are on average behavioural differences that persist _across cultures and across history_. \n\nThese are basic differences between men and women. It is the absolutely known, established\u00a0and strong effect<b>  of </b>sex hormones. \n\nLadies If I can live with cut guys parading with their shirts off, you can live with sexy cartoon ladies. Get over it, and hey, maybe get to the gym, if you feel that threatened by the social power of other women (even when they are cartoons, lol). If you want to get into science, get into science. Not only is no-one stopping you, you'll be hired preferentially at a ratio of 2 to 1, lol. \n\nAs for the author of this video, Nerdwriter\u00a0- read up on some legit evolutionary psychology. Study the known biolog<b> y of</b> sex hormones. Science is not confused or ambigious about this stuff, our culture is.\u00a0 When you read the legitimate, unbiased science outside of the bubble of feminist mythology, I know your a smart guy, it will really open your eyes, trust me.

They are PhDs, grad students, and undergrads. Those who are passionate about the sciences, just are. I've never experienced this \"boy's club\" mentality. To pay the bills I work in a small, locally-owned company and I definitely experience it there, so I don't feel like it's something I'm <b> blind </b>to. \n\nAnd, as a science major, I can tell you for a fact, no researcher cares about the<b>  gender</b> of the author in a potential citation. None. Most of the time you can't even tell who they were, as most published names have an initial for first letters, and there is no way, no way tha<b> t gende</b>r would somehow quell the hunger we all feel when we're making an argument in an abstract to our own research paper or grant proposal. Maybe that doesn't make sense to someone who's not in the sciences, but there is a desperate, desperate hunger to build substantial arguments, and I can't even imagine a proclaim<b> ed misogyni</b>st googling each author for a citation, just to make sure there weren't any women in there... Some publications have upwards of 20 authors! Can you imagine the time requirement necessary to be that petty? Not to sound self-important, but those of us in the sciences have way more pressing matters absorbing our time t<b> han gen</b>der exclusion.\n\nWith that in mind, the citative(made up word) disparity is entirely fascinating if it really exists. Given there's no easy way to <b> tell ge</b>nder, this is an issue that should be studied at length. I'd have to see if I thought the stats held up on the citation disparity, but if they do and I decide to do a lit analysis to pad my CV I'll post back with a link to my findings. For now I should probably stop wasting time on youtube and get back to my Linear Algebra homework. \n\nThough I think you probably missed the boat here, or at least temporarily squandered an opportunity to seriously explore a valid issue, I do love your work.

            "commentText": "While this video makes some very valid points (though certainly appears to examine them through a pretty one sided lens), it closes with a pretty awful strawman. It strongly implies that those people that are annoyed by SWJ's are actually threatened rather than annoyed. Not only does it couch this as a neutral (\"ask yourself which you feel) while making a thinly veiled accusation (\"you're probably threatened\"), it also means that your fallback position (\"I'm not threatened\") is one of a trivial emotion (\"annoyance\"). It's a classic debate strategy cleverly (or, hopefully, unintentionally?) used as a closing argument to the video.\n\nPeople can defend a scientist who they feel is wrongfully maligned for reasons other than annoyance at his accuser. The lack of civil debate that occurred (yes, on both sides of the issue) is the real argument that most people have against SJWs right now. Frequently, those people on the side of SJWs (and I realize I'm painting with a broad brush stroke here... my goal is not to equate all SJWs... it's convenient short hand here) want to create binary situations (he's either for us or against us) out of grey situations. They want to stifle commentary. They do this either by shouting louder or, in Mike's case (and I say this as an avid subscriber to Idea Channel), use lengthy sentences and big words to sound objective and academic while displaying a veneer of elucidation when persuasion is their actual intent.\n\nI like intelligent discussion. I like coming at these things with an open mind. It's been 2 years since this event (debacle?) and I think we can all agree that the number of women harmed by this man's shirt was probably small. The amount of change that has been made in a predominantly masculine industry has been minute at best. And the amount of reasonable discourse that has actually been made here has been slim to none. Getting outraged (triggered?) at these things doesn't advance the cause. It sets it back. Over and over and over again. There are people that want these things to change but they don't want to do it by torching the whole system or by demonizing those individuals who succeeded within the system they grew up in.\n\nLastly, PLEASE, read some broadly sourced academic literature on pay disparity. There is sooooo much more going on then I think you realize. Pay disparity has many, many factors and some of them deserve a very different discussion. Currently, recent female graduates actually out earn men. Given the historical bias in favor of men, this is pretty surprising. How much pay disparity is due to job steering? How much due to education steering? How much due to different priorities and what portion of those priorities are biological vs. sociological? How much should society work to subsidize the biological end of those equations given the (in this at least) competing goals of fairness and procreation? These are all difficult questions that do not have clean moral answers. The involve competing interests with valid arguments on both sides. Demonizing the other side and just saying that they're wrong and should go \"fuck off\" does no good when the goal is to find a solution that everyone can live with.\n\nI know this video is two years <b> old.</b> I know this was a lot of writing. Hopefully you still read these and glean something from this.",

It implies humans are slaves to their own history and unable to ever change or resist its effects. Since our society is so rapidly changing and evolving in so many ways, you can see why that is an absurd thing to believe.\n\nIt also implies that reverse versions of discrimination are something to be argued against, when they simply don't exist. The default definition of any form of discrimination is made so it can apply to anyone in society. No reverse versions, no exceptions.",

It's a bigger problem all these people brought so much notice to a shirt which was difficult to see anyway. When I watched it, I was too enthralled with what he was saying to notice the shirt. And to those saying he's stupid for putting his point of view and unsubbing, you are doing the exact opposite of what he just said to do. Feminism isn't meant to tear men down but  to build women up to an equal standard, so those women you hear talking about how piggish men are and how feminism is the greatest thing in the world. They don't even know what they're talking about. Thank you.",

                    "commentText": "I think Evan is circling a valid point but I agree more with this. Yes, <b> sexism </b>is very real and I think normalized mysoginist archetypes can often do harm to women who wish to pursue historically non-traditional careers. But if a shirt displays imagery that supports stereotypical or sexualized portrayals of women, is that shirt actually part of the reason for the wage gap and<b>  gender</b> bias in STEM? I think Evan went really soft on the people engaging in character assassinations. You might consider a guy's fashion sense to be in bad taste because of that, but it's a whole other leap to say the images conveyed on it confirm sexist intent or that \"even if it's unintentional it still does harm\". Does it? Really? That thing specifically is doing the harm? Just because something is associated with the greater harm by implication, that doesn't mean the thing is directly contributing to it. Whether it is should depend on portrayal and context. It would be one thing if he actually expressed sexist ideas verbally to support such conclusions but he didn't. I feel like a lot of progressives (and I generally consider myself one) tend to unfairly prioritize breadth over depth of harm. In this case it's all women versus one man. An unintentional slight should not excuse rabid personal attacks, even if that slight may contribute to a larger problem. Implicit association with a greater harm does not make something more harmful than the character assassination of one man. Shirts like that may be a symptom of sexist society, but they are not the cause o<b> f sexis</b>m. Attacking someone for it do<b> es nothi</b>ng but make people feel victimized. Not because of the fact that \"oh no I like this shirt, that's annoying\" but because the social policing is so strict and unforgiving, that it puts them in that position by default. Going about it so aggressively gi<b> ves z</b>ero room for a person to learn/change and makes it far less likely for people to take the overall issu<b> e of se</b>xism seriously. That feeling of digging into someone and ripping them apart while self-righteously waving the banner of social justice is far more pleasurable than whatever that guy got out of wearing a shirt.",

It's like if i wear my maralin shirt where she is holding guns. like does wearing that make me pro gun? thus pro school shooting? nope. its just a cool shirt. This is probably my least favorite video from you cuz i thought progressive ideas support wearing whatever u want. Like when that guy put his shirt on in the morning, he was a human being puttig on a shirt. like anyone who thinks someone wearing a shirt keeps women down. like how? Its a shirt. its not a shirt that says \"women are hoes\" its a retro shirt. :/ like if we keep this logic women shouldn't wear anything that says \"juicy\" or \"slut\" or \"i swallow\" cuz that just demeans all women. cuz it follows that if a man wearing a shirt of scantly clad women is offesnive so too should it be a scantly clad women wearing directly sexualizing words over the parts highlighted by tight clothing should sned a message that demeans women u know? like what id really like to see, is some smart bitches wearing juicy shorts in the stem field admiring and complimenting some punk looking dudes cool retro shirt while they pass around a joint and listen to pink floyed while solving some stem field problems.

The women shown there are shown as dangerous and sexy in the same time. A women just like a man wants to be respected and looking phyisically attractive. When you think it through the end the women shown there are feminist archetypes - amazons. Pure feminists in this sense. These images are typical for Heavy Metal culture. Metalheads back then used to grow long hair, singing high pitched and even wearing womens cloth but acting at the same time ultra masculine. That was a true rebellion. To me it seems our generation has <b> nothing </b>to rebel against, there are no taboos anymore. So feminists rebel by doing the opposite of rebelling.

We do not hold a torch and say we are the bleeding hearts for our <b> gender.</b> The rationale that we must have equality by numbers rather than by opportunity is a farce. All the same, we are all equals and to say that the underlying thread is invisible is to say that it is non-existent.

Also, I've heard stories of top level pro Smash Bros. players, a game I'm a frequent player of, inappropriately touching girls. I didn't pay it much attention though because really, it's not relevant to me, even if they're prominent figures in the competitive Smash scene. I'll still enjoy games. There's way more cool guys who see me as just another gamer than sexist douches. And even if there weren't, that's no reason to give up on something I want to do.",

Let's be honest, the reason MOST people don't enter STEM fields is because they are extremely difficult and require a lot of hard work and dedication. That is a big reason why these jobs pay so much money. Aside from those with a truly undying passion for their job, a large incentive for having a STEM job is the financial security. In my perspective, it seems that males in our culture have far greater expectations to provide financial security than females. This makes it so that females don't feel as pressured to choose jobs in these more difficult fields. Now, one could argue that the expectation of women to depend and men to provide is \"sexist\", but that's an entirely different arguemnt than \"men prevent women from getting engineering degrees because they hate when women have more power than them\". It seems your point in and of itself is also a cultural assumption.",

It was hard to put my finger on at first but a lot of the guys going into the sciences don't have much experience working with women and have an anxiety that if women are getting good positions or moving up in the field then there is less success or opportunities available to them. There is also the issue that some men tend to see all women as potential<b>  sexual</b> partners instead of just colleagues and are angry when they have to keep relationships professional. And then there are some that are just plai<b> n ol</b>d misogynistic and think women should stay out of the workplace. That last one is the most uncommon- most guys seem to just feel a general dislike to having to work with women. Also, there tends to be this idea that older men are more hostile to women in STEM than millennial men but it's actually the opposite. Younger guys are a lot less likely to work on a project with a female colleague, whether it's doing research or just writing a paper. I remember one man that even turned down a grant because the team would have included<b>  a wom</b>an we both worked with. To sum it up- I've never been sexually harassed (although I know it does happen) but for a lot of women, I think it's hard for them to feel excluded in a workplace that otherwise works as a team and to deal with the passive-aggressive resentment that<b>  is com</b>mon with young men these days.",

While I think it is true that men are pressured to go into \"masculine\" fields such as STEM versus something along the lines of fashion design, I think your mislabeling the reason there aren't as many women in STEM fields. Think about it - just because <b> a woma</b>n doesn't feel as \"pressured\" to be the financial support of her family doesn't mean she doesn't want to make money, or that she doesn't want to be her own financial support.",

Men definitely are sexualized in this society, but it occurs much less often and at a much older <b> age </b>than women. Girls as young as 12 often have moments where they realize men are looking at their bodies in a<b>  sexual</b> way. Women's bodies have been sexualized in media and advertisements for a long time as well, whereas male sexualization in media is a more recent development. Just look at advertisements from the 50s; women are displayed just as much as the products. The real problem with all this is that it can teach some people that women exist only objects to be sexualized, to be looked at or touched for pleasure alone, without consideration for the fact that women are people who deserve empathy. Male sexualization can have this harmful affect as well, but because it occurs less frequently and to a smaller extent, there hasn't been a push for a movement preventing male sexualization equal to the feminist movement preventing female sexualization.",

We aren't talking about physical or psychological abuse here (Why do you even mention IPV and <b> sexual </b>violence?). Just some scientist and his freaking shirt! (BTW, are we seriously going to start expecting 'nerds' to have better social skills? If there is one social group I would excuse for asocial behavior and not understanding social norms is scientists)\n\nAlso, why did the leaking of the Damore manifesto affect you in such an awful way? It wasn't a public statement, just some guy expressing his personal concerns about the way the company in which he worked operated. As far as I'm aware he wasn't even the one who published the memo online, meaning he expressed his opinion in as a tasteful way as he could. \n\nAnd why is it a problem that some media portray and treat women in a certain way? If you don't like a TV show, you can change the channel. If you don't like a movie, you can see another film. If you don't like a magazine, you can read something else. Mass Media follows the money, people start leaving for channels/movies/magazines that treat women fairly, then that's what they will offer. If a<b>  woman</b> doesn't study a STEM field because media portrays \"women as status symbols valued for their aesthetics to be \"worn\" by men\" then she probably is unable to cope with any kind of frustration and should study in a less stressful, competitive and demanding field. G\n\nFinally, what can be done to solve this alleged* issue?  You even recognized that this can't be solved by legislative means, so... what's the proposed solution? Publicly shame and harras those who act in a way the crowds find distasteful?  Best scenario, that ends like anothe<b> r R<b> e</b</b>>d Scare, worst, it polarizes American society even more and violence escalates. \n\n*Had I mentioned that there is no way of proving whether or not an issue even exists? The only way of demonstrating that there are more men than women in STEM due to cultural reasons rather than biological or evolutionary ones is to raise a human population in at least the hundreds completely isolated from the rest of the world and see what patterns emerge. Since a study like that one would be really expensive (and would violate a couple Human Rights), it's impossible to affirm with absolute certainty which explanation is correct. \n\n[This shouldn't be taken as an attack of any kind, I just vomited everything that I could think about and I'm honestly interested in the answers. Why did I do it? Idk, probably how you described modern feminist issues as hard to visualize and explain, which made me think that maybe you could explain some of the problems I have (had) with 'shirtgate' in particular, and modern feminism in general.]",

He did not wear the shirt to assert <b> sexual </b>dominance. He didn't even pick the shirt himself. The shirt was a gift by a<b>  woman</b>. You can argue whether it was appropriate to wear the shirt in such a public context and you can try to find out whether the colleagues (and potential colleagues) generally find this appropriate for their workplace when it's not on TV -- but you can't blame him personally for being \"sexist\".\n\nYou point out that being sexist/racist/whatever is pleasurable, but so is being morally outraged. And outrage culture is exactly that: a hedonistic outlet that allows us to righteously harass and denigrate people in a way that would be wholly unacceptable if they hadn't been declared as valid targets for violating social norms. The people \"calling him out\" were harassing him in a way that's socially acceptable -- this is where the slur \"crybullies\" comes from: harassment being justified by either portraying yourself as the victim (\"so how dare you question my behaviour\") or speaking on behalf of the supposed victims (whether they actually exist or not).\n\nThe employment gaps are interesting, yes, and they may be the result of social norms that make certain people feel unwelcome in certain fields, but mob justice is never acceptable and psychological violence is still a form of violence (and can be far more traumatising than mere physical violence). This poor human was harassed to tears over a shirt that would have been perfectly acceptable in other contexts. It was never about him or the shirt, they only served as a proxy for the<b>  \"patriarch</b>y\" or \"misogynists\" or whatever -- a confused mess of actual network effects negatively affecting women and the various individual abuses by men throughout society. They saw a guy who fit their bill for a sexist scapegoat and they tore him to shreds with complete disregard for his actual person.",

If different people are feeling different things about a situation then either A. those people's feelings of that situation are irrelevant and it's ultimately a moot point or B. one side has the better argument and logic. But this is besides the point.\n\nBecause you see the paradox comes from the realities the shirt actually entailed and how much it diverged from my imagination.\nFirst thing that I tried to figure out was what makes the shirt so bad?\nOnly two findings come to mind.\n1. Revealing clothing\n2. <b> Sexual </b>clothing\n\nOther things I was surprised to not find.\nSubjucation\nDegradation\nTorture\n\nSo I had to come to the conclusion that people are offending by the sexualization of the females. And said sexualization is objectifying to women and it perpetuates something something harmful culture. Basically the stock feminist argument. Which raises an interesting question...\n\nIf the bar for objectification is sexualization then wouldn't that call into question<b>  sexual</b> freedom?\nNow usually the defence I'd get from that is that it's different when people are consensting, but if the people who are viewing said image of consenting porn stars and consenting models why would you expect them to discern these details?\nFrom our youth specifically it's all the same whether or not it's a cartoon or real people or drawn people. It's all objectifying in their eyes.\nFrom this assumption it'd call into question our entire basis fo<b> r sexua</b>l freedom and liberation as it can have untold effects on our young girls by perpetuating harmful stereotypes and an offensive culture. \n\nThere in lies the paradox of female objectification. You cannot ha<b> ve sexu</b>al freedom with<b> out sex</b>ual objectification. And I'm assuming you aren't a \u2018family values' porn is evil super conservative. But at the same time according to you this shirt is problematic. I can only assume because of the sexualization. So I'm confused.\n\nIn response to this confusion I have a few questions...\n1. Where do you draw lines of women's portrayal in visual mediums(what are your standards specifically)?\n2. How does the shirt contribute to an offensive culture? Can you prove it?\n3. What is your opinion of women who consent to over sexualization?\n4. How am I to believe feminist objectification argument is different from the opinions of prudish conservatives?\n5. Which side of this argument is right and why?",

We've all worked with assholes before.

That's on you and people are right to call you on it.   \n\nIf you are putting up with shit,  you are doing yourself a disservice to put a shirt in the same category.

It's the male-dominated system, powered by money/profit, ensuring that those women's bodies appear to the viewer in a \"pleasurable\" way.

            "commentText": "The answer to the Question at the end: Annoyed.\n\n    I believe women should get equal pay and absolutely think there should be more women in the stem fields; however, I'm not pleased with the way the feminist movement is going about trying to make that change happen. Constant complaining and less action. If you want a change in legislation, devote your life to it and become a politician so you can effect that change, I know some women have done that already but not enough, when you're best option for a president is Hillary Clinton you know you don't have a lot of options  (not trying to get into a political debate about the election, but I think most people if they had their first pick of who would represent women as a president would probably have someone else in mind). My point is there's a lot of talking, a lot of being offended, a lot of complaining, but not a lot of action.\n    Secondly, I feel that the feminist movement has actually deepened the rift between genders (in recent years) more than actually helping. When people are constantly comparing the two genders instead of accepting their differences, saying that equal has to mean the same, it just forces us farther apart. I don't like the idea that women and men are the same, I think we're different and I think that's beautiful. For instance, I think women are better stay-at-home parents then men, not that the women are incapable of going in to various carriers but that statistically men make worse stay-at-home parents. Men (usually) as good as nurturing and comforting, I'm not arguing whether that is is because of conditioning or biology; regardless the fact remains that they aren't as good at it. I definitely don't want a future where children are sent to nurseries and raised by hired babysitters, I find this selfish on the parents side and think this is detrimental to future generations. Although that is besides the point, it's meant to be an example of what I'm trying to say which is that equal doesn't have to mean the same, this is perhaps my biggest problem with the feminist movement.\n    Lastly, the \"man-haters\". I know quite a few feminists who try to be social justice warriors but the more I hear them talk the more I realize they never have anything good to say about any man. I know this one girl who I heard complaining (rightly so) about a man being sexist and misogynistic, then just the next week heard her complaining about a man who was trying to defend feminist ideals saying \"he couldn't understand our problems so he has no right to talk about them, he's never been in our shoes\". So we can't be misogynistic and we can't be feminists, what are we supposed to do? I realize that not all feminists are like this but there is definitely a good sized group of feminists that hold this disposition.\n    I suppose I'd like to draw a line between what feminism and what I'm going to call hyper-feminism. If you define feminism as wanting equal rights, pay, and respect towards women then count me in, I'm absolutely a feminist, but if you take it a step farther to what I believe it has become, then count me out. And in addition to counting me out please leave me alone, stop twisting my words to things they were not intended to say with your extreme political correctness, let me speak my mind in my own way - I promise I don't have any hatred or superiority in my heart towards women and I don't see <b> gender </b>as a competition. If you're offended by everybody then maybe you should tone down what offends you, maybe I'm not the problem, maybe you're just easily offended. So to recap: not threatened, just annoyed, please leave me alone!",

Fuck off, Imma buy that shirt with the naked anime girls now. I've been pondering on that for a week. \n\nHonestly I knew a girl in high school who was a nice friend of mine, she was good at every subject so she wasn't sure what to study later but her mom kept pushing her to study physics because \"there aren't enough women there\". She kept refusing because even though she wasn't sure what she wanted to study in particular she knew it was not going to be physics. She eventually studied psychology. And guess what, her mom wasn't even in the science field herself. It shows how women can make their own decisions now and some of us decide against other peoples agenda. The male-female gap exists because we can make our own decisions. My mom studied engeneering and economics so of course she'd be much more happy if I studied something the likes, but no, I study arts. This is what I've been noticing for quite some time, people want to FORCE diversity. They ignore the voices of people whithin and claim it's social norms while society literally tells us the exact opposite. And here's the big part. When people speak of social or cultural norms, they forget that they are part of the culture. THEY are society. It's not some magical creature, WE design our way of living.",

Now why, instead of just denying <b> sexual </b>dimorphism, don't you think about ways to prove or disprove what hypothesis better maps reality. Is it that women are not that much into hard sciences or that there's a bias or discrimination against them? You mention one idea you don't like, and pass judgement on it as (maybe) people just following an invisible bias. But what if it was true that women statistically don't like that much the STEM field, what would that imply? Should we close the sciences to women? Well of course not. It speaks about what's generally the case. But there's where the individuals come in. You can have an incredible female physicist or mathematician that stands out among everyone else in their field, and there should be room for her too. But trying to unnaturally balance the score is wrong and painful for both sexes, and as with your video on dragons, it has a negative impact on the results and overall progress of our civilization.\n\n2. Then you state that it's pleasurable to assert your dominance, there are contexts for that too. I mean, if I'm playing chess, I like to win, and I get pleasure from winning, yeah. But there are other situations where I would despise myself if I was trying to assert dominance. With my family for instance, I try to please my wife and I try to get my kids to learn skills that will make them (hopefully) better than I am, you can see that I'm hardly trying to dominate them. Or at work, I team up with some other people to get things done, and since the goal is to get things done, it's really easy to work as a team. And it's unnecesary to say that with my family or my team at work I also get pleasure. If asserting your dominance is such a driving force, then the ultimate achievement would be to dominate yourself, and we would all arrive to that conclusion. Whereas mocking someone's physical characteristics, preferences or ideas is not asserting dominance. Despising is not subdoing. Rejecting is not controlling. \n\nSo no. In my case the annoyance has<b>  nothing</b> to do with fear or loss of pleasure, but with detecting bias and willful ignorance: you don't say here are the two (or more) explanations for the numbers given by the statistics, you dismiss the explanation you don't like and keep on the one you do as if it was the truth. Yep, my annoyance is about the lack of rigour on feminist/sjw arguments, and how they try to dress them as the truth.",

The shirt is representational and invites the topic that women feel discouraged from entering STEM fields because of objectification/sexualization. \nFrom a young <b> age </b>women are heavily criticized in regards to appearance (this statement is oversimplified, I can explain if anyone wants me to) but this criticizing heavily impacts self-esteem.  These issues with self esteem and the pressures of looking a very specific way effect the confidence (and interest) of women joining STEM fields. \nIn regards to the interest of joining STEM fields, If you look at commercials for children's shows (for ex.) you'll notice specific marketing for \"boy\" and \"girl\" toys (girls have makeup, baking, beauty related toys while boys have super heros, guns, robotics and remote controlled cars). Even in womens fashion you'll notice it's fast paced and complicated compared to mens fashion. That may even relate to how markets prefer having a target group of customers who want the same thing rather than a bunch of individuals with varied interests. I guess in saying this I'm trying to illustrate how<b>  sexism</b> is not as simple as a tee-shirt. The tee-shirt reminds us of an underlying societal issue.

Ironically its also apart of a culture that promotes individualism. Why wouldn't women use this individualism to ignore such images? If the answer is something like, \"because we live in a culture that works to indoctrinate women into gendered norms\" then wouldn't the solution be to to educate women about the illusionary nature of norms showing them that they need not follow these norms, instead of attacking things that work to promote these norms?",

Margaret Atwood's poem \"Male Fantasies\" from The Robber Bride really sums it up - you feel like you're constantly under observation to perform as <b> sex </b>icons such as Kim Kardashian perform, for the gratification of men even if, like me (a<b>  lesbian</b>), you aren't attracted to men: you're still programmed by a society that proliferates images such as those on that guy's shirt to crave male approval. In image, yes, but also if we propagate the idea that men approve of women who fit the roles assigned to women, roles firmly outside of STEM, it becomes increasingly difficult for a women to be taken seriously in anything outside what is perceived to be her role.",

Perhaps women are less inclined to join STEM simply because they aren't interested in STEM. The fucking idiots with <b> gender </b>studies degrees fail to realize that, instead of getting a degree with practically no related jobs, they could have gotten a STEM degree and been a scientist who makes good money, instead of complaining about a lack of women in these fields and how there is a<b>  gender</b> wage gap (which, by the way, is statistically bullshit, since there are more women lower paying fields, take more time off, are less likely to ask for a raise, etc.). And, if some asshole who says \"women can't be scientists\" makes you decide to give up on being a scientist, you deserve failure. You reap what you sew. Many of the greatest accomplishments in human history were done by people who were told that what they were doing was impossible. If everyone listened when they were told that what they were doing was impossible, we would never have traveled into space, the Americas would remain undiscovered by Europeans, women/minorities wouldn't have rights in many parts of the world, and you wouldn't be watching this video, nor would I have ever written this comment.",

So stop using culture as your straw man. \nits simple not the reason for a lot of peoples choices in life. And if you look at it from animal/beastly perspective, it make more sense that when one <b> gender </b>can birth children and the other can't, that their desires are not always the same nor should it be. There is a reason our survival instinct isn't always the same.\n\nPeople should not be afraid of expressing themselves even if there is a camera pointed at them, if he likes the shirt, he should be allowed to wear it. He should not cover in fear of offending someone.\nIf people can't be themselves home,work,public etc.. they have a more difficult time enjoying life\n\np.s. as far i have heard from the story, it was a<b>  woman</b> how also gave the shirt to him. Some other's don't like it, but people will always find a reason for not liking it. Stop worrying about it, and be true to who you are, you will have a more full filled and happy life.\n\nI do agree culture also affect a lot, but don't think its the only reason all the time without proof.",

Because the image of the women that's portrayed in this is that women are petty and weak willed (at least that's how I see it).\n\nI'm for equality I just think that wanting a quick change will only antagonize (reactance) people who were on the fence and further antagonize the one of the other side.

            "commentText": "the movement doesn't even seem to have a single position on this. half of them hate the porn industry for objectifying women, the other half are like \"Fuck off, women should do what they want with their bodies, including sell them.\" half are like \"you go girl, sleep with as many guys as you want. Yay <b> sex </b>workers, yay all female body types.\" the others are like, \"Damn those dirty men for feasting their piggy little eyes on naked women! Think of the children and the stereotypes!!\" as an outsider i'm at a loss. how do you get to a society where women are sexually autonomous, while also keeping their sexuality under wraps where it cant be exploited by media and consumers? i dont think it's possible. we are<b>  sexual</b> beings, programmed to objectify each others' bodies, and evidently those urges are much stronger in men than women. i dont see how we'll ever get away from that short of 1984-lik<b> e sexua</b>l reprogramming. \n\ni guess the conclusion i'm reaching is not that the guy's shirt was a problem. the shirt in itself hurts no one except those prone to victimizing themselves. the problem is not male consumption of female sexuality. that has always happened and will always happen so long as society remains free, as will the reverse. so what are we worried about? women being driven away from STEM by the perception that it is <b> an o</b>ld boys club? it certainly doesn't affect women in school, who perform as well as if not better than men all the way through university now. in my own graduate office there are easily more women than men. perhaps that is the exception, but taking a look around my building i think not, although i am in the biological sciences and not math or physics. no, women leave STEM AFTER their graduate studies. the reason why is pretty self-evident. the post-graduate years are the end of prime baby-making time. STEM are generally highly competitive fields. employers want people they can trust to be productive virtually all the time. building a research program in academia requires a relatively constant stream of publications, new projects, new students, etc. women consistently state throughout their teenage and college years that they prefer more work-life balance than men do. raising a family rather than being wedded to a career. perhaps there are a handful of women who genuinely get snubbed for funding, professorships, etc. for no reason other than suspicion of future baby-making, when in reality they are as single-minded in their career pursuit as any man, but i find it hard to believe that is any kind of epidemic. and again, even if it were an epidemic, the issues would be well removed from a sexy shirt and would not even come close to justifying the disgusting character assassination on what would otherwise probably have been the proudest moment of that man's life.\n\nhere's a final thought: maybe those images dont exploit female sexuality, they exploit male sexuality.",

You can be a more leftist feminist, a more liberal one or a more conservative one. Personally I think you are mixing up women being in charge of their own bodies and women being exploited by others. While a single <b> woman </b>sleeping with a lot of guys doesn't harm anyone and is about her choosing to do that, the porn industry on other hand reinforces views that harm women as a group because it is prone to sexualising violence and innocence (which ties into the sexualization of young teens). Additionally, the porn industry is run by men who also get the most money, so it is no longer a single<b>  woman</b> in charge of her own body and nudity.\n\nI'm curious to why you think this guy's shirt harmed no one. While I think it doesn't necessarily discourage women from going into STEM, you have to think in a larger context. How do you think girls feel seeing themselves portrayed as objects? And why would he choose to wear a shirt like that, since it was obviously a natural choice. Don't you think that it is harmful that he put on a shirt with a women that sexualised without further thought? do you honestly think you would ever see a women put on a similar shirt, if not as a protest therefore with thought behind it? Don't you think that this shows that it is a problem that goes far beyond his shirt, and rather ties into our society's views on female vs male sexuality?\n\nYes we will always, as individuals, view other people sexually. The problem lies within a society where a shirt like this can be manufactured sold and worn with no one along the way questioning it before it reaches the public. Additionally, does male sexuality really have to be tied to women's objectification? \n\nPlease comment back, I'm genuinely interested in a discussion.",

                    "commentText": "Okay, I can sort of see where you're coming from with all this, but, to be honest, I don't agree with most of what you said. To address the first paragraph: just because different people in a movement have different opinions on things and on the best course of action for resolving what they see as a problem does not mean that the whole movement is thus worthless and should not be taken seriously. For example, just because Martin Luther King Jr and Malcolm X had differing stands on what actions should be taken during the civil rights movement does not mean that <b> racism </b>and discrimination were (are) not issues. It just means that they were complicated issues that had no clear solution. The same is true of feminism in the modern era.\n\nIn response to your second paragraph and the implication that women are less successful in a demanding field because of the fact that they are the<b>  gender</b> who can get pregnant, well... I mean, I won't say that's not what causes the lack of women in STEM jobs. I don't really know if it is the case or not. What I will say is, even if women are losing out on STEM jobs just because of their \"baby-making\" tendencies, it doesn't mean that that's not still a discriminatory practice. Last I checked, it takes two to make a baby. Just because th<b> e woma</b>n happens to carry the baby around with her for nine months does not mean that she is the one solely responsible for its care. Men and women can both want children, or they can both want to not have children. It's not a purely female thing to want to be a parent. Just because we've grown up in a culture that socialized us to believe that women should be the primary care-givers to children and men should primarily focus on their careers does not mean that that is an appropriate or non-discriminatory belief. In fact, it's quite reminiscent of the \"separate spheres\" ideology of the 50s which said that<b>  a wom</b>an's place was in the home, behind <b> the o</b>ven, and I think we've all moved past that kind of thinking. There is no reason to expect that just because a person wants to have children, they should not also be allowed to have a career. There is no reason to believe that a man who wants children should be able to do so without devoting any of the time previously ascribed to working to taking care of his new child, while it is assumed th<b> at a w</b>oman will do so. The assumption that beca<b> use a </b>woman wants a family she should not also be able to have a career she enjoys, while refusing to apply the same logic to a man is, in itself, unfair and unequal, and harmful to women. What you're saying is <b> that a</b> woman must choose between having children and having a career, while a man can have both without making the same sacrifice. I don't blame you for thinking this way, as you were socialized to do so, but that doesn't make it okay.\n\nThat's basically all. Reply if you want to, I would love to hear some other perspectives.",

Mainly, I think, this confusion and emotional shouting is because we still haven't quite grasped <b> gender </b>equality and<b>  sexual</b> liberation as humankind and individuals.\n\n2. What the heck; the pictures show an actio<b> n woma</b>n with guns, probably a femme fatale assassin, that uses every means necessary to be as dangerous as possible and use her individual power, maybe even on the expense of others' human rights. So how does that fit into any picture of being inferior to others? More like a goddess of war and deceit portrayed here, wouldn't you agree?",

The themes are all there for it. It feels much like the outrage is over them being scantily clad, and sure, some of them are at the \"how do you physically wear that?\" level, but from the brief glimpse I saw, those are no more 'wrong' or 'bad' than anything else.  The idea that how someone dresses on a shirt has some impact into the life choice of what interests you and you want to pursue seems... strange to me.  There's a LOT of stuff that says to women \"Don't go into STEM\", but I just can't wrap my mind around how a shirt does this.  I am big into computers, not because society said I should be, but because when I was 10 my dad started teaching me about them and I fell in love. The idea that 'background noise' dictates someones choices is silly, primary sources, parents, teachers, mentors, when were are young and looking are the thing that matters.",

If a pervasive culture of <b> sexism </b>really discourages women from entering the stem field, then shouldn't we teach people that those sexiet opinions don't matter and to forge on in spite of them. It is almost impossible to change a culture other than simply waiting it out, but I think we can teach people how to succeed despite that obstacle.\n\nIn the end his shirt might be indicative of a problem, but him changing his shirt won't help women.

Little boys are encouraged to be audacious, courageous, tough and to affirm themselves ;once they grow up, they are able to easily differentiate them from whatever objectifies them because of the education they're given. The same can't be said about little girls, who are taught to be pretty, gracious, delicate and that they need to please others as well as society to be respected and liked ; therefore they feel pressured to fit society's demands, and it is much more difficult for them to ignore the objectification of women. What I'm triying to say is that objectification can be oppresive to anyone, no matter your gendre or <b> sex,</b> but that overall, the education girls receive does not provide them with the tools needed to escape the pressure of objectification. However, things are changing, and women are given better education and are slowly being freed from their cultural shackles, but its much easier to end objectification than to end centuries of toxic education and stereotypes. I do agree though that we honestly shouldn't give a fuck about the shirt, its really not important, but these kind of things allow us to discuss deeper and bigger problems which are realted to things like that shirt.",

For example, sophisms are continously used by politicians and public figures and people still fall for them because they listen to their emotions and don't make the effort to make use of reason, and that ability to make use of reason is something that is taught, its not biological, or else let me tell you shit like the holocaust would never habe happened. I would like to discuss more on  this subject with you, you actually make some good points, but you try to taunt me and tell me to ''fuck off' and etc.', which makes me think you're too emotionally invested in this discussion and therefore will not be able to listen to my arguments. It's normal to be convinced of our perceptions and opinions, but the human experience is completely suvjective so I'd tell you never to fully trust yourself. Anyway, small parenthesis here, my previous argument was inspired by Simone de Beauvoir's writing, and I think its still holds. Honeslty 20 years of education (keep in mind, education hasn't changed for everyone) is simply not enough to destroy centuries of social and <b> gender </b>constructs that are still present in different degrees in our everyday life.

Same as abortion. I'm not going to try and proclaim something about an isolated village in a foreign country's culture if I've never been there, or don't speak the language, or let someone take my advice betting their life's savings on a rugby match if I've never watched a game in my life. I'm not going to lecture a physicist or a surgeon about things I'm not informed about. You can have an understanding of what life's like for different people, it's when you make the mistake of demanding your theoretical understanding be prioritised over theirs that you encounter serious issues. Like insisting you should be the one to do a job someone else in the room is better informed and qualified to do because you've read the Wikipedia page and maybe a book on it. \n\nAnd yeah, not all women represent all women, duh. So the conversation should be largely driven by women. You're off the hook, judgement regarding a type of life experience you'll literally never have is unasked for and unnecessary. At it's most basic, men will never have the same experience of culture and societally bred discrimination (if they're straight and caucasian anyway, #buzzword but it's true, no simpler way to phrase it don't get offended) (I'm also both straight, male, and caucasian fyi) that would inform an opinion about that shirt. YEAH FUCKING DUH men aren't offended by shirts of really beefy guys with abs, or feel insecure about it, because there's no cultural structure of sexualisation that dehumanises men, leads to absurdly disproportionat<b> e sexua</b>l assault and rape statistics (the most significant factor), and affects their lives and career opportunities.\n\nAnd if you're offended by the implication that you might not know everything there is to know about someone else's lived experience, ask yourself (not me) why you assume you don't have more to learn on the subject, or why it's such a 'sexist' injustice to imply that people have different experiences and there are certain ones you'll never have the authority to speak to. Why does that aggravate you? \n\nOnce again, I really doubt you'd be offended by someone asking an astrophysicist to work at NASA or someone with a law degree to defend them in court over you, because you'd say \"oh sorry, I don't really have the qualifications to provide a contribution compared to the other alternative options you could ask in this context.

There are several problems with this line of reasoning. \n\nFirst is that there are only a few experiences in this world which are truly limited to a certain group of people, say child birth or getting kicked really hard in the nuts--each experience the exclusive province of people who have vaginas or testicles.  Yet even these experiences fall under the broader umbrella of \"Pain.\" \n\nIf you ask someone: \"How did it feel to get kicked in the nuts?\"\n\nand they respond... \"It was painful.\"\n\nYou will be able to understand their experiential state of being, based on your own previous experiences with the sensation known as pain. In fact, this is why we wince when we see people get hurt. Our brains have what are called mirror-neurons, which read the emotional state of other creatures based on physical cues and activate similar brain patterns in our own minds. In other words, you literally feel vicariously through other people. \n\nSecondly, knowledge can exist without experience. Take your \"isolated village\" for example. Let's say you happened upon this village and found that they had a religious doctrine which demanded that every brunette female, upon her eighteenth birthday, be raped by the entire village, skinned from her waist down, and then roasted alive over an open flame to become a sacrificial feast to the gods. Tell me, do you need to conduct an in depth ethnographic study to understand the experience of these girls? \n\nLet's take another of your examples that's less extreme: You wouldn't lecture a surgeon on something you aren't informed about (his job I assume). Wise choice.\n\nBut tell me, does a doctor need to have cancer to treat people with cancer? No. They have medical training. But where did that medical training come from? Did they learn how to treat cancer by surviving cancer? No. They learned about cancer from a completely ABSTRACT body of knowledge, which was created by conducting empirical studies on people who do have cancer. \n\nSo you see, we agree. You say we should listen to experts, but the experts are using the exact same methods to reach their conclusions as I am--statistical data.\n\nYou can have all the first hand experience in the world, it only makes you an expert on yourself. To determine the veracity of a claim about anymore than one person you necessarily have to use statistics.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay, your second point. It seems to be something along the lines of \"issues that affect women should be decided by women because only women can understand them.\"\n\nThis is not only sexist as all fuck, but it also defies basic common-sense and contradicts your previous point.\n\nOne, it implies that there are \"things that can only be understood by women.\" If we accept this premise we would necessarily also have to accept that there are ideas which can only be understood by other groups of people such as men, or asians, or <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>people. If we go down that road, then the door opens for the case to be made that some groups have 'better brains' than each other, or are biologically superior, since they can understand certain ideas that other groups can't. If this were true--as you suggest it is--it would validate every argument ever made by Social Darwinists, who sought to subjugate people of different colors on the basis that their skin color reduced thei<b> r menta</b>l capacity and therefore made them sub-human.\n\nNext, your contradiction. In your previous point you suggested that we listen to the people who have extensive knowledge about a topic to form our conclusions--I agree. So why would the conversation be \"largely driven by women?\" The criteria to be<b>  a wom</b>an is simply that you were born that way by chance. It doesn't make you an expert on all women. Take for instance women's health.  \n\nYou said before that we should rely on surgeons <b> (or doct</b>ors) for medical advice, which I agree with, because their title implies that they have actually gone out of their way to educate themselves on a certain subject. So tell me, which group would you say knows more about women's reproductive health: \n\nA group of world renowned gynecologists, who happen to all be men, or a group of women who work various retail jobs?\n\nIf you want to remain consistent with your previous point it is the former.\n\nFinally, how, if we can't understand people's experiences without living them, can you make all those claims about women's oppression? Women don't know what it's like to live as men--they've never done it--how do they know it's any easier? It could be far worse for all they know. You're a man, but you've never be<b> en a w</b>oman. How can you compare? I know, I know. You've got facts and statistics, but I thought you said we couldn't understand experience through abstract measures such as those? So which one is it? Are statistics a valid method of determining the average experience or not? And if they are in your case, why aren't they in my case?\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt doesn't bother me that I'll never experience something EXACTLY the same as someone else does--they won't ever know my exact experiences either. But what does aggravate me is this notion that we should just shut up and believe extraordinary claims people make because they've experienced some hardship, when there is ample evidence to the contrary.\n\nIt's perfectly fine if someone wants to say... \"That movie made me sad.\"\n\nI could point to the fact that they were laughing, and smiling, and looked pretty happy while they watched it. But at the end of the day I don't have a Sad-O-Meter to measure their emotions, so I just have to trust their self-reporting of the experience.\n\nHowever, it's something entirely different when someone says... \"I experienced X, therefore, EVERYONE who happens to have the same genitals as me also experiences X,\" even though there is evidence which clearly demonstrates that that is not true.\n\nAnd it's especially egregious to make claims on behalf of other people like that when there are millions of people who fit the criteria and say...\" No, that's not been my experience.\"\n\n\nUsing one persons subjective experience is the exact opposite of what scientists at NASA do. The entire point of Science is to get past our own subjective experiences, because we know they're always biased, and extract some objective-truth about the reality outside of ourselves.\n\nThe point is, when you make a claim outside of yourself, you need to back it up with evidence outside of your own experiences.",

I'm as big a supporter of feminism as anyone, and I know the issues brought up in this thread are very real issues, but I also know how to pick my battles. Some things are only an issue when you make them into one, and a <b> dumb </b>shirt - which was made for Matt Taylor by a female friend, I might add - falls squarely into that category.\n\nThe backlash to his shirt only made things worse. Not only was Taylor bullied to literal tears on social media (but his feelings don't matter - right?), it took the attention away from a major scientific achievement in favor of the clothes he was wearing. It also increased sales of the shirt in question in support of Taylor.<b>  Nothing</b> gets accomplished when we make mountains out of molehills.\n\nLastly, I feel the need to respond to one specific part of a comment left here -\n\"YEAH FUCKING DUH men aren't offended by shirts of really beefy guys with abs, or feel insecure about it, because there's no cultural structure of sexualisation that dehumanises men, leads to absurdly disproportionat<b> e sexua</b>l assault and rape statistics (the most significant factor), and affects their lives and career opportunities.\"\nActually there is, and there are scholarly articles about the subject.

Now, i for one am not necessarily against the <b> sexual </b>portrayal of women in something like a shirt, what i son't appreciate is the idea that people unconsciously assume through extensive imagery that women are to be portrayed like that in the real world. Maybe if me were portrayed in a similiar fasion there would be an equal standing on the matter. But would it solve the problem, or just create another one reversed? Are we to sacrifice our freedoms of these unconscious actions for the sake of a better environment for everyone? Everything related to the loss of freedom is a huge dillema, especially in the USA. The good ol'debate of \"don't do that, it offends someone, somewhere\". Is it even possible to live in a world where<b>  nobody</b> is offended through these unconscious portrayals? Would we like to live in such world? Maybe. Hard to know. But as of now, let's make an effort to change some of our habits that we unconsciously do, but actively know we shouldn't.",

I wish to note, though, there was an interesting dichotomy he brought up at 2:00. That is: a central focus of the feminist movement is to condemn the depiction of female sexuality as a commodity. In this, there can be no doubt, they are in the right. The manner in which media and the public at large has been conditioned to view the human body, particularly a woman's body is deplorable, to perpetuates objectification and projects a cultural expectation that can limit a person's development. However, I recently had a discussion with a friend who said she wasn't offended by such images in and of themselves because a person, regardless of <b> gender,</b> should be allowed to express their sexuality as they see fit. That is, if someone wants to flaunt the fact that they are a<b>  sexual</b> being, to display that to a wider audience (Kardashian), they have a full right to do so. What I am concerned about is that while I suppose this is true, each person has a right to express themselves however they please, I think that as a culture we should limit it. In the same way as we condemn the use of certain words because they are considered profane or obscene, perhaps we should frown upon certain imagery because it lowers the tone of the conversation and leaves open the door for exploitation.",

If Kim K feels empowered by expressing her sexuality there is absolutely <b> nothing </b>wrong with that, however the issue occurs when when the female body is commodified for the consumption of men. The issue with the over sexualization of women is that it's dehumanizing. It reduces a<b>  woman</b> to an object o<b> f sexua</b>l desire. It's the difference between being a human being in touch with their sexuality and being<b>  a s</b>ex object. I don't know that displays of sexuality lower discourse though. I don't think banning expressions of sexuality does anyone any good, but it's important to think about how those expressions are used and who has the power.",

As for demanding more violence towards \"evil\" females, well, we have to have more female villains for that, don't we? You will of course find exceptions, but the vast majority of villains are men, and I don't know any feminists who think that's a good thing.\n\nAlthough I will point out that there IS a huge amount of violence towards women depicted in media - it's called torture porn, and it is often unnecessarily sexualized. I would love to see more violence towards women depicted in the same way as it is for men - not as some creepy spectacle with lingering camera shots over her body parts while her gasps of pain sound weirdly orgasmic.\n\nYour arguments definitely come across as tone-deaf, and I can tell you've employed a heavy amount of confirmation bias and write from a place of defensiveness rather than actual reflection or research. I struggle to believe you've even read the feminist perspective when not twisted by trolls on 4chan, let alone had an actual conversation with one.\n\nThe last point I will make here is this: MEN are the ones that are controlling how they are portrayed. A vast majority of people in positions to create, produce, and ultimately shape the depiction of men are...men. Whereas women do not and never have had the power to shape the way they are depicted on a macro level. (To be clear, I'm not interested in you rattling off a list of female directors or producers to try and prove some point. The statistics show that largely, men are the ones in charge of these things.)\n\nIf you have a problem with the way men are depicted, you have the systemic power to change that depiction. Women do not have this luxury. When we even have the gall to complain, we get shut down by men, our arguments are refuted with insubstantial, irrelevant evidence, the problems are shifted in an attempt to distract, and men will prove over and over again that they cannot handle the SLIGHTEST criticism of their beloved institutions and systems. Any amount to reclaim some power is met with obstinance from all fronts, often abusive on some level and sometimes outright violent.",

This may indeed dissuade some women from entering a STEM field. Moreover, cultivation theory says that if feminists repeat enough times that scientists are sexist, and mass media gives them enough exposure, women will really start believing that scientists are sexist, even as it is not true. This most surely can dissuade some women from entering a STEM field. See, cultivation theory makes the most sense when speaking about the tv audience that spends 7 days a week in front of it - in other words, it needs continued and regular exposure to a single source in order to be able to change the perception of reality of the subject. So while a single shirt can't possibly have such an effect, the 24/7 whining that a shirt is sexist certainly comes much closer to what the cultivation theory is about. \nOn the other hand, research done on violence and video games pretty conclusively shows that violent video games don't actually cause violence. That seems to imply that as long as one is sane and can separate reality from fiction, he can't perceive the fictional women on a shirt as something sexist. Because, you know, fashionable designs are also a kind of fiction. \nUnless, of course, one uses the other definition of <b> sexism,</b> and then pretty much every shirt a man wears can be seen as perpetuating<b>  sexism</b>. Because the cis white male is the top of the social hierarchy, so everything connected to him is also sexist<b> , racis</b>t, bigoted and so on.",

Your whole argument is well-worded, however, entirely misconstrued for the simple fact that if women donn't want to be portrayed this way, then don't allow yourself to be on a shirt dressed like this. Also, your argument is tremendously flawed because if this situation were reversed, this outrage wouldn't be there. Also, if men were treated as <b> sex </b>objects, I highly doubt someone would complain to the degree you have. Lastly, by implying that this shirt is sexist, then you must infer that the women on it are sexist, since they agreed to having this image shared! Therefore, I would arguing you are excluding women from being allowed to choose to be a<b>  sex</b> symbol, and stating that being <b> a se</b>x symbol is sexist. The fact that something is on a shirt does not define anyone. Many of guys own shirts that have athletes, or musicians, etc, yet they don't often end up achieving what is on that shirt. If someone wore a shirt with an image of the Bride from Kill Bill, how would that be defining anyone besides the character from that movie? A t-shirt can't define<b>  a gend</b>er, that is absurd, and despite your extremely well-made video, the ideas you present here are incredibly flawed.",

Nerdwriter is tackling the idea of <b> sexism </b>by using the shirt as an example, a way to guide the thought process surrounding<b>  sexism</b>. He explains that the shirt is being criticized because some people think that it is leading women away from pursuing STEM related fields, which is why it matters that the shirt had sexualized images o<b> f woma</b>n because it may lead women to think that STEM is, like Nerdwriter said, \"a boy's only club.\" You're saying that he gives no proper facts or statistics, but in the video at 2:42 he gave legitimate facts and statistics to defend his argument on how women often do not pursue STEM careers. Nerdwriter talks very little about the sexualization of women or whether or not the shirt is propagating it he is just using it somewhat as an introduction into the topic <b> of sexi</b>sm, therefore, I still believe that your argument is still a little flawed itself.

I have tried to be neutral in explaining the video, but you clearly remained very biased for seemingly no reason. If you are going to be relatively closed minded maybe you shouldn't bother watching or commenting on videos like this. Honestly, you're the biggest hypocrite here, you're asking me to provide evidence, but you have none of your own. Have you ever taken a sociology class? They do plenty of studies on <b> gender,</b> I'm sure I could look in my<b>  old</b> sociology book right now or even just do a simple google search. Are you actually saying studies on how society views different genders don't exist? Calling that bullshit gives me a good idea of your intelligence level. And again, I never said my opinion on the shirt. I was just explaining the video. You continue to pull assumptions from nowhere and this argument is continually going nowhere therefore I am done replying. Obviously me explaining isn't going to change you in any way and is just a waste of my time.",

It can also be worrying however, because when the problems of a group of people start getting channeled into one thing, it can indeed, at least theoretically become very dangerous, as history has shown many times. Like when social problems in post WWI Germany led to the rise of National socialism. Terrible example I know, as it's thankfully ridiculous to compare the severity of those \"problems\" and the percentage of population affected and misguided by them, but at the core I'd say it's the same phenomenon.",

My boss from the stem cell company I'm working in at the moment is a <b> woman,</b> and I have to say women tend to be a bit more guided on an emotional level. Sometimes we argue about things where I'm pretty sure that I am right (and others agree). Though, her cognitive dissonance is so strong that it's really hard to convince her. I don't see this very often with male scientists. It's not necessarily a bad characteristic to think emotionally but it's very hard for women to be cold blooded like men and just accept things the way they are. Since science is all about facts and not how we want things to be (nature isn't always the way we expect it) you have to face the truth. I'm talking about the average (and not all women). It's quite easy for men to stick to rules (of nature). Especially when things aren't the way my boss wouldn't like them to be she says: \"that's not possible, that cannot be\". People may disagree and the thought isn't very friendly to say but I think that in average women think more on an emotional level. I think that is (among other reasons) why scienctific fields have less women (men are better at focussing on small things, a very important skill in science,  while women are much better at keeping things organized and thinking in context).\nOf course there is other reasons why women don't get into science (cultural reasons, etc.) but I think what I mentioned is the main reason.\nWhat's your thoughts on this?",

I was a cheerleader through elementary/junior/high school.  No one ever pushed me toward math or science in any way because it was just assumed that I was a blonde, ditzy cheerleader.  But, as a freshman, I decided to get a head start on school the summer before, and picked up my geometry book for a self guided lesson.  I wanted to give myself a little jump on things since I often had little time for studying with all the cheer practice & games we attended.  I finished the geometry book in a few days....on my own.  I checked out an algebra book from the library - giddy with the excitement that comes from learning.  Finished it in 2 weeks.  Moved on to advanced algebra & on and on.  My sophomore year, I placed 1st out of my entire school of 3000+ kids in math, across the board, and was placed on our school's academic team.  Finished 6th in our state that year.  And yet not a single teacher, parent, or counselor EVER SUGGESTED I CONSIDER A CAREER IN MATH.  People thought it was cool that a cheerleader literally WAS the math team for our school.  But, they treated it like it was \"cute\".  In fact, NO ONE EVER MENTIONED COLLEGE TO ME AT ALL.  I ended up being accepted to UCLA 3 years after graduating high school, because a good friend saw me waitressing and said \"what in the hell are you doing?  Your'e going to college.  Apply immediately.\"  My point is, women deal with treatment throughout their lives that you will never grasp - and that they themselves have a hard time coming to terms with.  My little story probably didn't clarify the issue for you in the slightest, but I hope that it helped you see the difference between INTRINSIC personality traits, & things that have been learned from a world that undervalues our work, minds, opinions & accomplishments.",

It's the fact that some women, like myself, disagree with the way we are portrayed in the media by some people, because it comes down to saying that we need approval or help to do what we want to do. I've never felt discouraged to study in a STEM field, it's actually quite the opposite; I've felt pressured to do so. This reminds me of the time when some feminists shamed women who chose to stay home with their children instead of pursuing a career. We're perfectly able to make life decisions, this is what these women are saying.\n\nAnd why should there be as many women as there are men in every field anyway? I don't understand why it's so controversial to suppose that men and women have some differences (on a statistical level).

It's about equality.<b>  Patriarchy</b> hurts both sexes. It tells men that if they don't act in a certain manner they are \"pussies\"/ not real men.

Women enjoy social interaction more than mechanical interaction.. this is already seen in studies on newborn babies. Emancipation of women is no where higher than in the west, yet women choosing STEM fields is lowest in the west. This is because our wealthy society allows women the freedom to choose without endangering their livelihood.\n\nWhy do you people feel the need to push women into STEM when most of us simply don't enjoy the work? Why does everything have to adhere to your naive interpretation how you think the world should be?",

Yes, men have been disposable, but why do men \"make\" women the \"crown jewel\" you speak of? The question we should be answering before completely dismissing feminism is: why have men gone through so much trouble to idolize women? To quote from you \"all they ever asked for was a cute wife and children\". Sure, that is a valid answer, but you forget to see this statement through a feminist view. We idolize the perfect family (which we sustain) which is undoubtedly the male goal, but why should this be women's fault? So the problem is not \"why are women bitching when they are idolized from the womb?\", but \"why do we, as men, put these pressures on ourselves?\"\n\nIf we cannot answer this question without saying \"that's what a man is supposed to do/be\" or picking at straws with biological defenses/solutions (because, let's be honest: we are not born knowing how a man/woman should behave), then this means that we feel as if our masculinity is being threatened. We cannot even think of blaming masculinity for women's issues, MUCH LESS for men's issues. Let's be honest, without the pressures of our own masculinity, the problems men go through (some of which you listed in your last paragraph) would be no more (or at least more manageable).\n\nIn this context, it makes sense why we see feminism as a clusterfuck (for lack of a better word) of ideas that make no sense. Masculinity has made men feel disenfranchised because it has made our lives seem secondary (after all, all we accomplish is for the \"cute wife and children\"), but has also made men competitive which is why we have a predominant male ratio in positions of power. All of these male issues feed into feminism because women are also affected by it.",

But would I criticize this guy for wearing that shirt? Nope. It's just stupid.",

In fact, women and men tend to have different interests. While women tend to more social jobs, more men in average go for the stem jobs. I think many people forget totally about average differences between hormon levels of men and women, which were not caused by society, but existed even before societies existed. Many phenomenons such as slut-shaming for example have their roots in the differences between men and women. While men can give their semen at almost every time, women only can get pregnant once in a month and when they are, they can't become pregnant for at least nine months. This causes an positive view on males who have<b>  sex</b> a lot and a negative when it comes to women. \nIs that apologizing slut-shaming? Absolutely not, but it shows that gender-issues are not rooted in an patriarchal society.",

With that being said, I also don't believe that this makes it \"okay\". Even though society has a history of sexualizing women and not taking them seriously, we can still make conscious choices. With all the discussions happening today about the subject, it is hard to believe that the people perpetuating that mentality haven't been giving the opportunity to think about it and reflect at least a little. So when somebody wears a shirt like that without thinking twice, for example, they most likely are either totally okay with where society is at or just didn't find it very convenient to care about what's going on so pretty much just continued living as if it wasn't really a thing. Sorry for the huge response, but this is basically why I do believe that critique is valid in this case and social tendencies shouldn't be an excuse anymore.",

(albeit in much smaller numbers) It's true that differences may cause discrimination, for example females are less physically fit than males, females (in the past at least) only had the option of nursing their young, which meant they stayed attached to their kid, but these are mainly problems that are irrelevant in the modern context (most work does not depend on manual labor, there are bottles now, and there are more women than men who graduate with a college degree in the US - so let's not knock women intelligence-wise.)\n\nMaybe consider that biological differences led to the discrimination in the first place, which were passed down the generations (aka became part of that society's CULTURE) so discrimination still occurs even now that biological differences are not that much of a deal. Also, you're making a fallacy, if A causes B, B does not necessarily happen because A happened. If more men then women are in stem fields, it could be because women are more social by nature or it could be because people in that industry still think it's okay to send <b> a woma</b>n a message such as \"Don't bring your laptop, bring your bikini, and we will talk about business after a swim.\" (this actually happened:  [LINK] ",

How do we know that women don't choose more social jobs because that's what society, on a conscious or subconscious level, urges them to do? I think there are really two extremes people take this, one where it is all society's fault, and the other where it's all biology, but I bet it's somewhere in the middle. I guess my point is that it isn't a valid claim to disregard these statistics regarding fields that have been male-dominated for thousands of years are today just because \"women and men tend to have different interests\". Without examining a society which lacks any form of<b>  sexism</b> against men or women, how can we really know that this is true?",

We live in a society that empowers women and encourages them to pursue any goal or dream that they have and the same goes for the <b> gender </b>pay gap, there are laws in place that strictly forbid the practice of paying one<b>  gender</b> more than the other or hiring on<b> e gende</b>r over the other. The opportunities are equal the choices are there to be made. Equality of outcome is not equality and only degrades the ambition of the people in question. I personally think that it is demeaning to tell someone that they cannot achieve this on their own and that they need special help or incentives because the paths they are picking are the wrong choices. Feminism had a place, and still does to some small extent, however instead of focusing on what divides us why not focus on what joins us, what we have <b> in comm</b>on, what our passions are. To some extent the 90's did this, being \"co<b> lor bl</b>ind\" was a virtue, treating other people not by what they looked like but by how they acted was encouraged. But somewhere along the line we forgot this and chose to focus on what divides us and wear our differences like badges to parade around and compare against others to see how we ranked on the oppression scale, and look at what our society has become. A society epitomized by division and hate. A society that is told constantly that it is failing and that society at a whole is at fault for the poor choices and lack of judgment of individuals. We need to, as a whole pull up our proverbial sleeves and work together instead of against each other to move forward instead of backward, because if we don't we will just keep regressing until we will have lost everything we have gained in the last 100 years. In short personal responsibility is key. You are the master of your own destiny even more so in the current world. Forge your own future not the future decided on by someone else.",

It's<b>  weird</b> the way you guys try to co-opt our language for your purposes. Authoritarian would be STRICTLY dictating that you are disallowed from wearing the shirt by an authority figure. That's not what's happening here.\n\nThere'<b> s nothin</b>g that prevents you from wearing the shirt to work except your boss. Just like you're allowed to express yourself with the shirt, women are allowed to be disgusted by the shirt and to avoid places in which the shirt and attitudes that come along with it are seen as normal. If your field is one wear you can wear a shirt that is covered is caricatures <b> of bla</b>ck people eating watermelon, don't exp<b> ect bl</b>ack people to be excited about entering that field. You've clearly demonstrated to them that your field isn't a hospitable place for them.\n\n>Heck, do you think somebody who'd think about doing science would ever care about fashion choices? \n\nUm. Yes? I know plenty of scientists who care about what they wear. They're not all goobers with no social skills or care for how they present themselves. \n\n\n>As usual, feminism demands a change for the sole reason to cater to a non-existing demographics.\n\nUh.

Last year I checked, the liberals had won the culture wars, and the social justice was in a position of power. \"Authoritarian\" does not mean \"governmental\".\n\nYou're making a basic mistake here. Not all <b> black </b>people would react in such a way. Actually, I'd wager if somebody had the mindset required to be a scientist, he wouldn't care about a fucking shirt.\n\nYou perfectly well know I don't mean all scientists hate fashion. I mean that scientists wouldn't judge a person by his fashion choices, if they are presented beforehand a proof of his worth. Of course, scientists are assholes at the same percentage as the rest of the population, but their value system is skewed towards rewarding intellect.\n\nFeminism caters to quite a small percentage of women in our society. The rest of the female population tends to not call themselves feminists.\n\nAnd the outrage came exclusively from people who were not in the STEM fields, and who would never be in the STEM fields. That's what I call \"non-existent demographics\". There is<b>  nobody</b> who would be turned off because of the fashion choices of the Shirt Guy.\n\nVice versa! Seeing some scientist on a live stream in such a silly shirt may make women feel more comfortable about the idea of working in a STEM field, considering it shows you don't need to keep rigid and official all the time. It shows a laid-back atmosphere, which is traditionally taken as welcoming by people who have second thoughts about going into a field.\n\nSo, for all I know, this shirt could have had a positive impact on how many women go in the STEM fields, but noooo, now that everybody bullied this guy, I'm sure women are scared to enter such a field. After all, statistically speaking women put less emphasis on money and more on work atmosphere.",

Pure chance is one possible reason. In such situations half of the time a man would get the job, right? But if you can prove intention, that the employer took the man because they prefer men over women, that's now sexist and punishable by law.\nOn the backdrop of this, the collectivist definition is indeed lost to many. In the collectivist definition the act itself is divorced from the intention of the individual, and is set in the context of the collectives the actors are part of.\nGoing to our example; if the employer is a school trying to hire a teacher, hiring the man is not sexist, because most educators are women. But if the employer is for example an IT company, it is sexist, because most IT employees are male. But if the man i<b> s a bl</b<b> >ac<b> k</b</b>> gay muslim, it is not sexist, because hiring the<b>  white</b> woman w<b> ould be</b> ra<b> cist and ho</b>mophobic.\n\nSo yeah, I completely agree most people on my side of this argument completely misunderstand this.\n\nThe problem is when people overstep the line between telling Shirt Guy \"I think this shirt makes women stay out of the STEM fields\" and telling Shirt Guy \"I think you shouldn't wear this shirt on live feeds\".\n\nYou see, the two sides of this debate are actually really close in opinion. Both sides recognize the power of societal conditioning and cultural clues. Why do I say this?\nBecause \"our\" side argues two things:\n1) Our society and our culture have instilled in most of us that being sexist is bad.\n2) The cultural authority of what is sexist and what is not is the surprisingly marxist academia in the social sciences. So this authority can exert authoritarian power over the normal person - and, ergo, by virtue of us living in a democracy, it can exert authoritarian power over everybody.\n\nThere are examples to support this: how Sir Tim Hunt was fired for example. Our society was manipulated, and outrage was fabricated in order to fire a man. This is clear abuse of power - this power being social capital, and ability to define what is sexist and what is not.\n\nSo yeah. On the other side of the coin, the same thing is being argued for:\n1) Our society and our culture have instilled in most of us that some sexist acts are good\n2) The cultural authority of what is sexist is the white male, and he's decided tha<b> t most </b>of sexism isn'<b> t actua</b>lly sexism, so by societal pressure he can exert authoritarian power over women and minorities.\n\nOf course, this line of thinking also has its set of examples. Take the War on Drugs: people have decid<b> ed it's</b> not racist*, while it's obvious it mainly targets minorities.\n\nThen again, why would anybody be surprised that two sides of the Left have similar views?\n\n*yeah, if we go by individualistic d<b> efiniti</b>on of rac<b> ism, it</b>'s not racist. But that just goes to show that it's not enough to<b>  implem</b>ent not racist policies, you have to actually implement policies that help the underprivileged classes. What do I mean by that? Identify a pr<b> oblem </b>that many black americans face (segregation into poor neighbourhoods for example), then device a policy to solve this particular problem (targeted programs for improving poor neighbourhoods over the whole country, no matter if t<b> he res</b>idents are black, latino, or white).",

I used to be much closer to your side, until I found myself asking the question: \"which side is actually doing more harm?\" I've come to the conclusion that the side which has endured the most marginalization, the side which is simply arguing that there shouldn't be any kind of innate power and privilege, the side that wants to escape from being reduced to an object, a stereotype, or a disadvantaged person is the side that is doing less harm. The shirt in this situation is a stark reminder that women are \"<b> sex </b>things\", much like the<b>  black</b> version of the shirt mentioned earlier is a reminder tha<b> t blac</b>k people are less than human. This kind of reductionist caricaturing doesn't exist for white men in any real significant way. What would the white guy shirt look like? What kind of shirt could they make that would make a white guy feel as though this wasn't innately a place that is available to him? What shirt could they wear that would evoke a history and an extant reality of the dehumanization of white men? There is no such shirt because there is no such history or situation like that. But that's how it should be for everyone. Everyone should be playing on that same field. As far as I can tell, to try to claim that everyone shouldn't....that everyone should continue to be relegated to the place in society that is dictated by a system that is made to benefit white men simply to avoid \"cultural marxism\" is inhuman and hateful.",

While I don't think that \"white male tears\" mugs and the \"basket of deplorables\" are  helping the situations -- you cannot compare slavery, segregation, voter suppression, the eradication of jobs in <b> black </b>inner cities which resulted in the erasure of jobs, which caused the drug trade to replace legitimate economies, resulting in squalor and mass incarceration, of redlining, in women being prevented from voting, from being socialized to be passive dwellers of homes and raisers of children to the detriment of their own agency, etc. etc. This DOES NOT EXIST for straight white men. This stuff has never happened to straight white men. I have to reemphasize that there IS NO history of oppression and marginalization for white men in this country. So you might be annoyed by those mugs and that statement by Clinton, but those things are not evocative of a systematic dehumanization of people like you as a whole. The comparison is just silly.\n\n>Besides, it's not that the white males didn't suffer in the past, it's that the civilization created by them survived, proving to be a better choice of lifestyle than all the rest.

Individualism is giving way ever so slightly one step at the time to collectivist values -- but those values have proven to be instrumental to happiness and well-being in regions like Canada, Western Europe and Northern Europe where the quality of life and genera satisfactions of its citizens are considerably higher than that of Americans. The people who are trying to stand in the way of that are conservatives, who actively want to return to a situation in which women are relegated to positions of subservience and<b>  black</b> citizen continue to exist in squalor because of a history and a legacy of apartheid in this country.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, let's put this aside.

Because there's an innate irony to want to escape stereotyping, while at the same time supporting identity politics, which is all about labeling yourself with the stereotype that most fits you.\n\nABSOLUTELY NOT. Labels are VERY important. They facilitate communication and understanding about the ways in which human beings are different and experience the world differently. The whole \"I don't see color\" or \"I don't treat you differently because you're<b>  a wom</b>an\" comes from the conservative side. Whereas our side is all about being sensitive to the differences in which we experience the world. I just went to get tacos in my neighborhood. On the way home, in the dark, I walked down the sidewalk an<b> d a wo</b>man walking in front of me turned her head to see who was walking behind her. She did that because she's concerned for her safety. She<b> 's a w</b>oman. She's physically probably not as strong as most men. She's in a position because of who she is where she has to be concerned about how vulnerable she is. I come from the school of thought where we don't try to pretend that she's exactly the same as me.....she's different...and I should try to accommodate the difference by being sensitive to her experience. So I walk ahead, in front of her so that she knows she's not threatened by me. If we just act like we're all the same then we aren't being deferential to one another's humanity. <b> I'm a </b>black guy. I don't want white people to treat me like a white person. I want people to acknowledge th<b> at I'm</b> black, and that it's possible that my experience is different. Similarly, I confer the same sort of acknowledgement and respect onto people that I know are different from me out of respect. What we want is for all humans, regardless of differences, to be treated with respect and decency and deference to humanity, so that no person by virtue of who they are has to exist at some kind of disadvantage. If you get rid of labels, you're not actually acknowledging the problem.It's like saying \"Well, if we just treat different kinds of broken legs the same way we'll have the same results. No. Leg breaks take different forms. We need to acknowledge each kind of break so we can accommodate it accordingly.",

The whole point is that you protect these rights, because you want everybody else as an individual to protect yours too. It's about the relationship between two peers, not about the relationship between a person and a group.\n\nThe point of socialism is to benefit EVERYBODY. Not \"the most number of people\", but EVERYBODY. Even a billionaire has a vested interest in socialistic policy, because he knows that he may go bankrupt one day.*\n\nSocialism is also designed as a way to make individual people succeed. Why? Because the specimens of Homo Sapiens are really risk-averse creatures. The social safety net is designed to eradicate the risk inherent to trying to succeed. Without it, less people would ever try to succeed.\n\nVice versa, capitalism in practice doesn't benefit individuals. It benefits corporations.\n\nThat's why if you try to implement capitalism without socialistic policies to counter-balance, you quickly devolve into corporatism and oligarchy. And, of course, if you try to implement socialism without capitalism, it quickly devolves into communism, national socialism, feminism, or some other collectivist ideology.\n\nFrankly, humanity can't do without collectives just yet. Even though it's proven again and again that the societies that are the most individualistic survive at the end.\n\nP.S. Yeah, and some people just have as a \"guideline\" that blacks are often thieves and murderers. They have <b> black </b>friends, hey! They are not<b>  racist</b>! It's just that they \"understand\" that if they see somebody who self-describes as African-American, there is a somewhat higher chance he may off them for a few bucks.\n\n*while a libertarian may say \"taxation is theft\", a socialist would say \"money are just a system, and as a system they must benefit all of us\". In this sense the billionaire is benefited from paying more money for taxes, because everybody knows countries with enormous income inequality are pretty much gonna get ruined sooner than later. After all, there must be someone to buy your products in order for your wealth to continue existing. So wealth redistribution benefits the wealthy too - in the long run at least.",

It isn't possible to determine what women are offended by, let alone determine that it is a precursor towards losing STEM jobs as pointed out by many women responding. The statistic is even misleading as only 2.6% of women explicitly go into engineering (most go into professional fields such as nursing and architecture, etc.).\n\nThe onus is on them to extrapolate the issues of women in STEM to the so deemed sexist mentality of STEM. They have to prove that it isolates better quality of work, more experience, is not a stay-at-home mom, etc. etc. The fact that they are using this man's shirt as an example of<b>  sexism</b> in STEM I feel undermines the grand scheme of \"privilege\" wherein women are simply raised to not like hard sciences and should be parenting.

Equating them is a fallacy of equivocation.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, <b> nothing </b>happened to the shirt-gate guy that hasn't happened to Anita. If one is okay, the other is. (Anita has probably received less negative attention from the mainstream media, but those aren't communications directed toward the man, nor would they usually be unjustifiably harsh, so I don't count them.)\n\nSaying that \"no actual threats have been verified as not being from her or her clique\" sets an unreasonable standard. Barring the threat-sender being caught, which hasn't happened and probably never will unless someone goes through with a threat and is arrested, no such verification could possibly occur. There is likewise no threat that has been proven to come from her, nor am I aware of any case of a feminist threatening themselves like that. She has received enough threats that it is unlikely that none of them are authentic.\n\nAlso, while I suspect the numbers are very, very different than you say, (I'd imagine less than a third of what she receives is criticism, and less than a third of that is constructive), it doesn't matter how much constructive criticism she receives compared to harassment. Imagine someone who received 1,000,000 harassing communications. Consider the level of badness that would have. Now, imagine that they receive 99,000,000 pieces of constructive criticism. Have the 1,000,000 communications lost badness? I don't think so. (The person might see fewer of them, but that doesn't decrease the badness that has been done, just the degree to which it had its intended effect.)\n\nI'd like you to show me where Anita has belittled or demonized gamers. Video and time slot, please. If I were unduly charitable, I might say you could accuse her of demonizing the designers of some of the specific games she criticizes, but certainly not all of gamerdom.

As long as the country is not ruled by the priest class and there is civilian police and court system, the priests are just authorities on what is good and what is bad, but authorities without legal power. Doesn't make them less authoritative. Same with the experts. This argument may be coming from the fact that I'm not used to the Pope pretty much pulling the strings of everybody throughout history, as my high school education didn't happen in a Catholic country.\n\n\"There is likewise no threat that has been proven to come from her, nor am I aware of any case of a feminist threatening themselves like that.\"\nSome threats were with suspiciously specific language, leaving people to assume they were written by a feminist or an ex-feminist. \nOf course, even one threat is too many, but that doesn't mean most people are simply trying to critique. <b> Nobody </b>should be expected to drop his criticism just because somebody else sent a threat. Same with harassment. Though I'd make a distinction between harassment and the brass chan culture. It's as if a Japanese thinks the American guy who enters his home with his shoes on is harassing him. It's not harassment, it's cultural differences. Sometimes people should just ignore the pointless rude words and try to get the message, the way every anon acts in every chan. In my opinion harassment should also be systematic and devoid of actual meaning, besides containing insults. \n\nOh, but that's not the question, is it? It's not about what the author wanted to say. She said what she wanted to say. It's about what messages the audience sees in the work. If I want to be 100% charitable to Anita... I'd still have plenty of problems with her, but we're speaking about the reaction she receives, which is not connected with 100% charitable reading of her videos.\nBesides the media did try to declare that \"the gamer identity is dead\".

The right to not be conscripted is a benefit (you may think men can't be conscripted anymore either, but no, the government technically can resume the draft whenever they want, and it will still be men-only). And women who decry feminism actually do have a problem with reaping this benefit. Women would have gotten the right to vote anyway - probably much later, when the draft stopped in the 70s - but feminists made sure to win this benefit instead of lobbying women to not oppose being conscripted. Don't misunderstand me, without feminism women would have gotten the right to vote waaaaaay too late.

People have this misconception that women were treated like shit through out history and that women were oppressed left right and center. But that's not strictly true, there are many cases through out history of women voting and women owning property, even as far back as the ancient Egyptians. In fourth century ancient Greece, over two-fifths of the land in Sparta was owned by women. In the fifteen hundreds, there were many female aristocrats who owned property and were able to vote. Same with eighteen hundreds and also in the nineteen hundreds too. In America many men weren't allowed to vote either, only property owners (that includes women) were allowed to vote. As far as I seen it, only the rich and powerful, no matter what <b> gender,</b> were allowed to vote back in the day and the poor were not, it had<b>  nothing</b> to do wit<b> h sexis</b>m. It just so happens to be that most of the rich and powerful people back in the day happened to be men, but also most of the poor people back in the day happened to be men too. People conveniently like to gloss over this fact.\n\nAs far as you personal story, I doubt the teachers separated the girls and boys because they were sexist, it's just that girls and boys enjoy different things. Generally the girls like to make food and play with dolls and the boys like to make electronic gadgets and play with cars. But if a girl asked to make gadgets with the boys, I highly doubt that the teachers would refuse and force the girl to go back to making food.",

If you look at the examples I gave in my previous comment, pretty much every society in history had a property/wealth based voting system. But that doesn't really matter, the past is the past and I want to move away from what happened back then because it's pretty much irrelevant now. What I want to know is how people can still say that institutionalized <b> sexism </b>is still a thing.\n\nAs for your school experience, I will admit that it's a little strange for your school to have such a policy. Your story is anecdotal so I can't know for sure if you're telling the truth, but I'll assume you're not lying and take your word for it. Even if that is true I don't see how that's sexist, I just think your school was a little too traditionalist. But either way it's irrelevant, point to a school in the western world now days that still does that?",

Yes women have been lacking power and certain rights but on the other hand men had too many rights and thus too many responsibilities. I find it very unfair and illogical that one has certain responsibilities because who he's born, especially when those responsibilities don't make any sense.\nWhen you choose to run for president you can't just complain over the hard job because that's what you chose. But men are born men and they have some rules and limits because they are men. Don't get me wrong, I don't ignore <b> sexism </b>against women but women's rights have become such a painful thing that we have completely forgotten about men's rights.

They have built up feminism as a terrible monster, a toxic ideology that is unreasonable, ridiculous and hates and oppresses all men because they need a reason not to listen to feminists. They need feminism to be evil and dangerous so they can justify not knowing about it, so they can continue enjoying the privilege of being sexist without feeling guilty. They are so angry because no matter what they do, they still can't escape feminism and they're not stupid enough to not feel guilty. \nA bit like some Christians know in their heart that God isn't real so they can't deal with any criticism towards him.",

Even now, when for decades they have been told they are men with vaginas.  \nMen feel less emotion (not no emotion) and are more able to get a grip on their emotions. The only point I would concede is that 50s men were encouraged to not discuss emotions (eg I feel shit because of my divorce) , I saw this in my father. \nMen and women are much happier when they realise they are complementary , not interchangeable.  I have seen Eastern European women flirt with random men , and they look much happier than the poor brainwashed young in todays institutions of lower education... the women have a permanent bitch face and look like they want to kill all men and themselves.\nHApiness levels for women have been going down steadily since the 1940s.  And now 1 in 4 women is on anti-depressants - way to go feminazis.",

If you work at some place where they hang calenders with nude girls on the wall, I could maybe see the \"boys club\" aspect, but this 1 guy who individually chose to look like that? The shirt communicates \"I'm a comic book nerd and/or hipster with a<b>  weird</b> fashion sense\" more that it communicates \"get back in the kitche<b> n woma</b>n\". Maybe we put too much value in the collective/the systemic whatever over the individual when we see that shirt as being a threat to society, when we cater to the weak and afraid girl that cares more about petty stuff like this than her own passion and career. In that case, no disrespect to girls that might feel like that, but that's really a personal problem, not a societal problem. I'm a very shy guy, but I don't expect society to not be so loud and lively all the time because they're really oppressing me.",

Or of the complete and utter bias the court system holds towards women and against men? Or the male suicide rate? Or the male homeless? We always speak of female issues, but males seem to be left out. In a male dominated society, surely these would be flipped? I believe we have been fed so much talk of the 'Evil White Male' that it seems that when equality sped up, the complaining never declined. Leading to there being an imbalance with cultural priorities. Instead of the magnitude of the issue we are now focusing on who the issue effects, when in reality it should be the other way around. And instead of focusing on the feelings potentially being hurt of some women (though not to discredit the issue as it is a problem) maybe the men of the world should get some love.",

And, I believe that's the point the Nerdwriter is trying to make that somethings have been invisiblised. (I don't completely by his \"oh, people like Taylor get pleasure out of it\" stuff, though.) Why it may feel like there is too much of this women's feelings are being hurt is because things are coming to light now; we are able to identify these small behaviours that are symptomatic of larger assumptions. And really, feminism is not about \"women are the best\"; feminism is about breaking the roles that people are traditionally put in, so it's not just for women, it's also for men and the assumptions that are made for these roles. And before you ask me why it's called feminism, it's because it started with the idea of women and their bodies.\nANyways, like I said, behaviours of <b> sexism </b>and<b>  misogyny</b> that people may find \"annoying\" or not worth thinking about or calling out, are symptomatic of larger assumptions--and these assumptions lead to bigger problems in places that you seem to be insulated from. There are places that women are still repressed and abused because of the cultural assumptions about their roles. So before we start to not think about these small behaviours o<b> f sexis</b>m and pat \"the men of the world\" on their backs for being nice enough to acknowledge that women are human beings, we should think about the orange that sits in the White House, who can pass of highly threatening comments like \"grab them by t<b> he pus</b>sy\" without being held accountable for them. We should also think about the women in certain countries who do not have access to education or even the basic human dignities of sanitation. So, if you think that society is dominated by women, please, pause, and think again.",

They just think I'm a <b> woman.</b> Also on a side note do you live in Europe, the USA or somewhere else. If it's the US I perfectly understand where you are coming from, although once again saying that it's engrained in society is still incorrect of you to say, as it's only shifting the blame from the person to the society, when in reality society is trying it's best to NOT be sexist,<b>  racist</b>, etc. If you truly believe that you (if you get the chance) should give Europe a try. It has much better laws regarding ant<b> i-sexis</b>m and an<b> ti-raci</b>sm, and if you still think that those societies are sexist, than it's not the society, it's probably either the specific people you met were sexist or you are being sexist.\n\nAt the end of the day, being discriminated against because of y<b> our gen</b>der happens all the time, but it's not rooted in our societies, it's rooted in our genetics, because for tens of thousands of years, we didn't have such a thing as philosophy, and so we couldn't understand the true meaning<b>  of \"ge</b>nder\" or \"sexuality\". Take medieval Europe for example. Yes, men saw women as baby-makers and something to brag about and flaunt everywhere at parties, but women saw men as fools who would do anythin<b> g fo</b>r sex, and who would do literally ANYTHING they wanted if they so much as asked. \n\nAbout representation in STEM, I meant public people like that. I just didn't mention Marie Curie, because she is the one token s<b> cience</b> woman who everyone brings up. It would be nice if we had more than one commonly known science gal. (Though honestly I know plenty of people who can only name Albert Einstein and no one else) I was however also referring to modern public women in science. For instance, Neil Degrasse Tyson. He is popular, semi-well known, and good at explaining things that people who don't have an IQ of 142. I can not remember a<b>  singl</b>e woman who was in any of the many science debates or shows that I have watched in the past week. So what? Is science sexist? No, it isn't. Why? Because science doesn't give a shit what genitals you have or wish you had. Are you smart? Yes? Great you can be a scientist. Get in line.\n\nAt the end of the day/month/year, Social media and the news likes to make a big de<b> al abou</b>t r<b> acism a</b>nd sexism, etc. But in real actual life from my own experiences and feedback from others of bot<b> h gende</b>rs, nobody fucking cares because there is no problem. Most men aren't monsters and most women aren't bitches. The only thing they claim that is real is the number of men in STEM jobs vs women in STEM jobs. I personally blame that on the fact that we have a technological revolution so often it makes it impossible for women to catch up. Now that society is no longer b<b> ias tow</b>ards gender, we just need a few decades where no big tech revolutions happen so that women can c<b> atch </b>up in a race they have been behind in for the past 12,017 years.\n\nToo bad that break probably won't happen\n [LINK] ",

Because you're high on passing privilege and girl privilege (yes, those are very real things) and it feels like you're finally in the driver's seat of your own life. You were the one who defied everyone's expectation that you would grow up to become a man, and through sheer self-determination compelled the world to accept you on your own terms as <b> a woma</b>n. A genuinely impressive achievement, but it comes with<b>  a bli</b>nd side.\n\nWhat you have done is authentic and valid, but it is not what most women experience, it is the trans experience. We experience something women cannot imagine because they had no choice but to be women. We had the option to CHOOSE to become women (rather than remain caricatures of men). We could do so because originally as men, we had exclusive control over our own lives, extending even to the point of choosing to discard the exclusive privileges of men. \n\nWomen do not have comparable privileges, because everywhere women must negotiate the terms of their lives to meet the approval of men. No matter what society you name, the range of options available to women are exquisitely circumscribed to limit their perogatives to fit within men's expectations of women. As we all know, that is a large part of the charm of bein<b> g a wo</b>man, how we confine our behavior to fit gracefully within the perimeters of the role. Most men are not even aware of the effort this requires, simply because they do not experience being a man as limiting their options in life.\n\nThe notable exception to this state of affairs is the realm of heterosexual love<b>  and</b> sex, one of the few opportunities men have to experience what it is like to negotiate the approval of women. While some men choose to rise to the challenge, many others clearly resent women's power to act on their own perogatives in this one special arena. The pity is that this novel experience seems to give these men so little insight on how the world is likewise experienced by women.",

Models are not necessarily being treated badly, but the whole culture of exposing women's bodies in movies, video clips and ads just for the sake of it, for example, without serving any purpose in the story, contributes to men viewing women as <b> sexual </b>objects and treating them violently, even if the actress themselves were not.\nI don't see what \"task performer\" has to do with \"object\", this is not about profession at all.\nThe point is, when people say objectify they mean \"to treat some as less than human\" and usually in a<b>  sexual</b> way. Language is not something set in stone, it changes and words meanings changes with time and with the context they are used. Objects can be treated well or badly, but comparing humans to objects is always seen as bad because of the context.\nAny further and we're just discussing semantics, so I'm gonna leave it here.

It's objectification in the absence of anything else that's a problem. We all objectify people when we exhibit attraction. They literally become the \"objects\" of our attraction. It's harmful only when your objectified perception of someone becomes the defining factor of your perception of them as a whole. When I see a coworker who I find attractive, part of me is going, \"that's a thing I want to have <b> sex </b>with.\" If I stop there, it's harmful. But if I also consider that my coworker is not defined by my<b>  sexual</b> attraction to her in any way, that she has skills and feelings and a moral disposition, then it's not so bad. She does not exist to be attractive to me, I have no claim to her because I am attracted to her and she is vastly more than just something I want to get into bed with, even if that is something I want on some level.\n\nApplying that to the bus driver, he's not defined by his role as a bus driver, that's just his job. Models, on the other hand, are almost entirely defined by their roles. They literally make a living out of being looked at as the objects of people'<b> s sexua</b>l desires. It transcends a workplace and on a very large scale, they're basically thought of as being important solely for the reason of being attractive. I'm not arguing models should go away, but the objectification of a model <b> is nothi</b>ng like the feelings most people have toward bus drivers. The reason it's damaging to women in general is because it perpetuates an idea that women in general are only valid as objects<b>  of sex</b>ual desire.\n\nUltimately the harmful nature of pu<b> rely se</b>xual objectification comes down to where you rank<b>  your s</b>exual attraction to someone in the list of reasons that validate their importance as humans. If you see it as a defining characteristic of a person, you're doing them a disservice and shortchanging them. If you know that they bring more to the table than giving you a boner, then it's not really a problem. You're allowed to find people hot, you're allowed to pu<b> rsue a </b>sexual relationship with them (within reason), just make sure you thoroughly understand that people you're attracted to are people too.",

You ask us to consider whether our cultural norms affect our thinking but you should ask yourself the same thing as your generation is growing up under a regime of hypersensitivity to even the slightest possible \"micro aggression\" ffs. Just because someone is offended doesn't mean they have a point or that anyone has to accede to their preferences. It's this kind of AUTHORITARIAN fascism that is wrong with the regressive left. Conversion by swordpoint? No. And the thing about the extremist left and statistics is that they alway ASSUME MALICE whenever they look at a number favoring men but LOOK DEEPER on numbers favoring women.

Examine whether a 70s era film theory notion of objectification NECESSARILY speaks to the real world and human behavior and psychology when it comes to things like fashion models and romance fiction book covers. And watch christina hoff sommers and camille paglia talk about these kinds of issues as feminists who think this kind of stuff is bullshit.

They offered us incentives to go to their all girl meetings. Girls just didn't show up. Most already had other career plans in mind. Those meetings specifically made me feel like I needed to go or otherwise I was failing my <b> gender.</b> It was pressure that I didn't like. This is just a personal gripe. I don't care  if they continue to do such things as it will either help girls get into the field or do<b>  nothing</b> at all.\n\nIf girls arent interested I don't think it's because men are scaring them away though. I would assume it's more because they never thought of those jobs as an option. There's an argument that girls follow their dreams more when they get a job and men go for the higher paying ones. Biology and being a doctor are dreams for plenty of people but other STEM jobs aren't.\nIt's a complicated question that could have many variables to sift through.",

We held events for young kids and it was obvious that for elementary and middle school <b> age </b>the girls were just as interested in the boys.

No one would have batted an eye if a female scientist had been wearing a shirt covered with artistic drawings of scantily clad men but Matt Taylor did get crucified and it was unjust for a plethora of reasons that you already know and I don't have time to type. I appreciate you putting forward your differing point of view, but I was irritated when you said \"we're not trying to crucify him\". By we I can only assume you mean feminist minded people rather than you personally. If this is the case, that was inaccurate or,\u00a0dare I be so rude as to say, a lie. You, as a group, did crucify him and that reaction says a massive amount about your stance and your moral validity on the issue.

            "commentText": "Your theory is that people take pleasure from <b> sexism </b>and establishing dominance and that not going against even a small thing percieved as such would be driven by fear of losing that pleasure. In a way you're saying we may be addicted to<b>  sexism</b>. That may indeed be the case sometimes, but I believe you've failed to consider that wearing that shirt may not be sexist at all. That kind of art derives from comic books, where both men and women are sexualized and whose bodies are portrayed as what we percieve or accept as ideal. Would you say, for instance, that my girlfriend telling me, after we sar CA: Civil War, that she wanted someone as strong and handsome as Captain America, is an example o<b> f sexis</b>m? Would the criticism follow, should<b>  a wom</b>an wear a shirt like this with male characters? Or compliment a hot guy's body on the web or anywhere else? If you believe, as I expect, that ev<b> ery wo</b>man has the right to do so, then the problem isn't sexualization, it's how we percieve it. Female sexualization is percieved as a sort of aggresion these days, but that is an assumption based on what you believe the person's values are towards females. If you s<b> ee a w</b>oman dressing in a sexy way, is it because she wants to be objectified by men or does she want to feel empowered or does she simply like the way she looks? If a guy wears this shirt, does he believe you should abuse women or does he merely celebrates the beauty of the female body? I think we haven't learned to see sexuality deprived from hate, abuse or dominance. Which is sad, really. How much better our relationships could be if we did? Peace.

Honestly I think the shirt looks quite ugly and I would never wear it myself, but to say it is offensive or that he can't or shouldn't wear it is ridiculous. Women graduate less in stem areas because men and women are different. One isn't better than the other, but the interrests of people tend to fall in line with their <b> gender </b>identity. You say that we might only think these are facts because they have been engrained into our society, but let me ask you this. Why is it that the majority of men in the fashion industry are<b>  ga<b> y</b</b>>? They are men, so if your theory that it is the cause of societal pressure were true then you'd assume that sexuality wouldn't be relevant, right? Yet it is. It seems that men who are genetically more feminine also share the same interrests as the majority of women. So would it not be the logical conclusion that genetics and actual biological differences between genders plays a major role?",

If that wasn't the definition then I would not magically alter my argument. I would just say \"psychologists, sociologists, antropolochists, etc\", instead of \"soft science\". Please stop whining about this insignificant bullcrap, all it does is show that you don't have an argument. I've seen this countless of times.

We already established that women do not get published less proportionally, they even get published more. Your argument, and please correct me if I am wrong, seems to be that scientists are sexist because they cite women less frequently.\n\nHaving established that, for your theory to work you'll have to assume that:\n1. Either that men and women are equally represented in all fields(which we know is not true) OR that all fields get cited equally overall(which seems very unlikely).\n2. That everyone in an industry that revolves around rational thought has an irrational hatred against women.\n3. That said people don't hate women enough to not cite them at all.\n4. That women don't simply work less hard. (may I remind you that you had absolutely <b> zero </b>trouble accepting that \"men work less hard\" when I pointed out that women are overrepresented in published articles on engineering. I agree that this is probably the reason, but I also think think that you can't have double standards. I also think it is possible that women simply work less hard in other fields, just like men work less hard in certain fields. )\n\nI'm sorry but these are not simple assumptions. All my theory requires you to assume is that soft sciences get cited less than hard sciences, and I even have arguments for why I think that might be the case.\n\n\"You assume, that the field in which women work are less based on hard facts and this is the reason why these papers publish less, thus women have fewer publication.\"\n\nNo, I KNOW that the subjects most female scientists work in are less based on hard facts.\n\nI ASSUME that this means they get cited less\n\nI DEFEND that position by pointing out that soft sciences change more than hard sciences and are less based on hard facts. Which again, I KNOW.\n\nAs you can see, I only assumed one thing. And I even have arguments for that assumption.\n\n\"But since it's just your theory, it's as much worth as my theory.\"\n\nI'm sorry but I don't believe in the notion that anything is \"worth\" anything outside of the field of economics. For example if you have to choose between killing a stranger and killing your father, most people will kill the stranger. Not because your father is \"worth\" less. The motivations for your actions have<b>  nothing</b> to do with \"worth\".\n\n\"Women, work as hard as men.\"\n\nThat's not a proven fact. That is your first assumption.\n\n\"But still women have less publication and citation\"\n\nWe already established that women get published MORE than men representatively. So no.\n\n\"These are facts.\"\nNo, one of those three things is a fact. One is straight out false and the other is an assumption.\n\n\"My theory is that they have fewer publication, because some men do discriminate them.\"\n\nThey discriminate them why...? If they can actually use the information in a study, why the hell would they NOT do so JUST because the person who wrote the study is female? That is a HUGE assumption.\n\n\" I make this assumtion because I have seen men rejecting women, based on thei<b> r gende</b>r. I do not claim this is a fact.\"\n\nWell at least we agree on that, it isn't a fact. Anecdotal evidence is never evidence.

It's just the thought that women are bad in general, without any reason to do so.\"\n\nWell no, that's not what discrimination is. You can discriminate and have a valid reason to do so. Discrimination isn't inherently bad. For example if I own a bar and won't let anyone under 18 in then I'm discriminating. But I have a very valid reason for doing so.\n\n\" So if you see a article is written by a women, you assume it's bad and don't cite it.\"\n\nSo why would people ignore scientific evidence that might further their own goals just because it was discovered by a <b> woman?</b> I find that very hard to believe, and since you don't have any evidence you're not going to convince me.\n\n\"Even women might think the work of a<b>  woman</b> is worth less. I don't know the reason for that. \"\n\nYour usage of the word \"might\" is crucial here. You are literally just assuming things without a reason for doing so except that it fits your political narrative. That is the very definition of irrational.\n\n\"Please give me some proves, which show that women are less productive in some fields like engineering.\"\n\nI already told you that this is merely an alternative explanation for the data you have shown me. I don't have any reason to believe this is the case, so I don't believe it is. All I wanted to point out is that you shouldn't jump to the conclusion that fits your political narrative if there are other explanations which are just as likely.\n\n\"Because the Study I showed you clearly says that the article by women are significantly more often published in better journals.\"\n\nAnd I already told you that this might be for other reasons than \"women are better than men\". For example, positive discrimination. In this day an<b> d ag</b>e positive discrimination is the new discrimination, so it could be very much possible.\n\n\"Papers published in better journals are cited less, if they are written by<b>  a wom</b>an. I'd like to hear a resonable explanation for that.\"\n\nMe too. Too bad that neither of us have an explanation for this data which we can back up with EVIDENCE. If you don't know what the explanation is then don't just believe whatever you want to believe, just say \"I don't know\".",

Life is too short to get mad about a shirt. Of course we're adults and we don't know what that does to a kid. Of course the same can be said that we need to make our girls stronger and make them understand that they will have to see that stuff and to look past it. I guess I am on two sides of the conversation. I don't see what's wrong with a shirt, at the same time I am not a 9 year <b> old </b>girl looking up to a man that's wearing the shirt. We need to explain better to our kids the difference between<b>  sexual</b> cartoons and pictures and becoming something better for ourselves. Be the change you want to see. Encourage the girls to join science and look past the shirt to see the science. In the end, it's about just teaching more girls and inviting them to stay.",

At the same time, if someone got turned away from a whole field of science or science in general then they might not truly have a passion for it like others do. And we can all agree that there are other variables that could play into this and not just a man's shirt. And I think that if we treat everyone to not get offended and to look past these little things then all of those things will lose whatever negative effects that they were having.",

I can't think of a single person I've met who matches that description.\n\nYes, some feminists are outrageous in their claims, but I think the number who think that way is in fact far smaller than many people believe. That community certainly doesn't warrant the backlash it receives when one considers how many flat earthers or anti vaccers there are.",

All of those are cogs in t<b> he sexi</b>sm machine, it's a system (that's why it's called a systemic oppression). The cogs are not the same size, and some (like here) are not illegal or dangerous, but they are still a part of the whole. To understand and deconstruct a machine you have to take ALL the parts into account, to see how the parts are related to each other. That's what academic femini<b> sm (gen</b>der studies) is doing, looking at all the parts. You can't just solve the big pieces, like the right to vote and contraception, and say you solved the system. There still a looooooot to unravel.",

You can try all you want but people will still find something more sexually attracting than others, it doesn't matter if it's a body, size of the wallet, brains or any other thing. True harm comes when person can't see anything boyond it and diminish a whole existence of a person to a<b>  sexual</b> object an<b> d nothin</b>g else, but even so it has exception as most people want to be desired and willingly beco<b> me sexu</b>al object for another person and in returncdo the same to them just because they believe they'll never meet again(it's called one night stand)...\nWe must educate nuances and self worth to the children. Most girls wants to be liked and it's ok, but if it's in a way of the goals they need to learn liking themselves despite popular opinion and find people who like them despite or because they exert 'bossyness' and leadership instead of becoming timid, just another face in the crowd/group...\nP.S. that shirt is not at fault, people who can't see it as his st<b> yle/sex</b>ual preference and not as an attack is.

                    "commentText": "Nope. But many repeated instances of such occurrences does build up into a normalised stereotype that STEM subjects are a \"man's\" field, which may subconsciously sway girls away from pursuing the field early on.\nThis happened to a handful of my friends around me when we were choosing which subjects to pursue in \"highschool\". I was in a high achieving class and many of my friends like me were high achievers in both the arts and sciences. By the end of the year a majority of my female friends chose to pursue the arts and to drop their science subjects. At first I assumed it was because they were more interested in those subjects, but then when I asked them (all of them) they said they actually had no preference between the two. If this was the case I would expect a 50/50 split, so I probed a little more and asked specifically why they chose the arts over the sciences. The replies were either \"I don't know\" or something vaguely along the lines of \"it fit more\" or \"parents/teachers expected me to...\". I was one of only two girls who actually did carry on with the sciences, and I did so with a very conscious almost giddy excitement that I was \"bucking the trend\". \nEqually, among the boys there was a similar phenomenon but in reverse. Most went to the sciences, a few remained in the arts (again in my class we were all-round achievers so these boys also were previously high achievers in both). I also chatted to them about this choice, I got similar responses referring vaguely to sentiments of \"belonging\" and \"I don't know\" (also one or two replies about better career prospects). I personally theorised that this trend reflected the culture of machismo that sways many young boys which often suggest that being \"artsy\"or \"creative\" is abnormal or emasculating. But that is just a theory.\nThat a guy owns a shirt is none of my business. But I do think he should have picked a more appropriate one to wear at that convention. It would be like an Arab at a prominent \"Celebrating diversity; let's all be friends\" convention wearing a shirt covered with bombs and explosions. Not exactly encouraging everyone to befriend the Arab is s/he?",

I don't think that the probably existing prejudice and expectations people have about i.e. scientists as being mostly males are things that should be discussed, because the level of awareness, where these attitudes, that we are talking about, sit, is immodifiable trough consciousness.(1)  Also I take issue with the fact that these disputes are terribly elitist trough their high intellectual demands. (2) \nI am personally a rather misanthropic person and do not believe in the human ability to truly better ourselves. (3) I think (because I'm a rather solution oriented thinker) that the only way to truly better humans is external unconscious behaviour- manipulation. We need to be taught like children, because we might be able to express a 'free' will, but we lack the ability to comprehend all the things that go into the making of our decisions, and even worse, what all the outcomes are. \n\n\n1. note that actually the consciousness is a rather small and also weak part of our mind\n\n2. the format of your video was pretty comprehensible though\n\n3. Our behaviour towards climate change is a good example (I'm no better either... just observing)",

Has it ever occurred to you that the lower number of women in STEM fields might be, at least in part, a product of many individual women choosing to pursue fields that are not STEM related? We should really take a step back here, because I worry that the thinking behind your outrage is more collectivist than what would be accurate to reality. And, by the way, there's no need to think that women are inherently worse at or less interested in science than men to hold the belief that it isn't completely institutional <b> sexism </b>that causes these discrepancies. I also think that it is backwards to think that a<b>  woman</b> expressing her sexuality oppresses women. There's something deeply conservative about this thinking, and a stigma against sexuality doe<b> s nothin</b>g to help women.

Many of them cannot seem to see past the \"system\" level (a consequence of adapting Marxism to cultures and identities), and largely ignore the autonomy of individual women. In this way, anything can be blamed on the \"system,\" if the ideologue doesn't see the desired outcome, rather than acknowledging more intricate truths. The choices that women make, if they don't fall in line with the ideology's goals, are the \"wrong\" choices, even as the ideology supposedly advocates for women's free and coercion-free choice.\n\nFor example, why do many people simultaneously encourage so many women to take <b> gender </b>studies degrees while complaining that not enough women are joining STEM? The ideology often seems more interested in perpetuating itself than actually advancing the placement of women. If women were found to be equal tomorrow, professional big-F Feminists would be out of a job, and thousands of people with<b>  Gender</b> Studies degrees would be straddled with debt for a purposeless degree. Therefor, they have an incentive to find more and more ways in which women are being held back, real or imagined.",

I promise you. Yes, in the family, men are statistically worse and unfortunately, have higher rates of abusing their family members I STILL PROMISE YOU...women are NOT innately nurturing. There's moms who allow abuse and moms who perpetrate abuse, there's moms who have drug problems and let their kids starve, go homeless, sell their kids for more... moms who purposefully have crippled their children just to keep them close by. moms who've sexually abused their children. moms who've abused their children so badly physically and emotionally, the child live streams their suicide on the internet? moms who've drowned their children? moms who've purposefully had boyfriends drown or kill their children for them?

                    "commentText": "+ThePuppyTurtle\nFeminism nowadays has its baggage of prominent voices, classes taught in universities, and actual actions taken by self-proclaimed feminists. \n\nIn short, feminism nowadays is largely understood by feminists and non-feminists alike as \"egalitarianism + the premise of class warfare between men and women\", if you allow me to oversimplify and paraphrase for the sake of brevity. Just don't take this literally, but as a general direction of what people (feminists and non-feminists) understand as feminism. \n\nEgalitarianism is far from the prominence of feminism, so the term is still quite free-floating, without any baggage attached to it. \n\nOf course, the real question you are asking is why people would use \"egalitarian\" or \"MRA\" to describe themselves, when there are (only a few) feminists who share their opinions? \n\nWell... first consider that \n1) feminism has accrued too many <b> black </b>points lately, so is in dire need of criticism\n2) most feminists are collectivists, as I mentioned earlier. This means that for them the \"in-group\" is \"the feminists and the women\" (interchangeably), and the \"out-group\" is everybody else who doesn't share their opinion. \nSo, in order to criticize these people, it's easier to ditch the label \"feminist\" outright than to suffer constant abuse that you are not a \"real\" feminist. Because the moment you start criticizing, you're no longer in the \"in-group\", so you are an enemy that must be defeated.\n\nSecond consider that public opinion on what feminism is is also created by your own actions if you call yourself a feminist. So if you think there is a systemic problem in the movement, it may be wise to ditch the label, as to not confuse the general public. \n\nFurther reading on this topic:  [LINK] ",

Do you feel like you have the higher moral ground or something? Your life finally has found meaning in acting smug in a random youtube comment? Sadly no, you don't have the higher moral ground, as normally defined. Because most people don't have the morals of a cultural marxist. Of course it doesn't feel like you're stealing something. The usual term used when acting systematically to gain societal power is \"usurp\". \n\n>Think about it.\nYeah, well, I'm not a teenager anymore. My morals won't simply change to align with a cultural marxist's just because feminism said so. Once established, if there's enough room for flexibility so that there aren't any internal inconsistencies, morality is quite the inertial thing.

I think it's a sense of morality each person has and if one's is abused then the individual should be taught why it is wrong to everyone else. We shouldn't just shut the person out of the conversation because it would only make them feel left out, angry and misunderstood. If someone is mentally ill and the right to express themselves is manifested as a right to use violence, words that might deeply hurt people etc. then we can't do anything but... sue them/put them in a psychiatric hospital because the sense of morality in such individual is damaged in the brain. Not influenced by anything. So if you for example see someone sharing <b> racist </b>thoughts then okay it is an abuse of the right in some sort but i believe what is good is explaining to the person why it's bad. Or just going deeply inside the source. Asking questing where the idea came from etc. because that's what this person believes is right! Also to support your point -The law tells people what's a good/bad thing to say. Basically what might hurt other people and objectively is wrong (shared sense of morality I guess) is forbidden and the person might even go to jail for it. That is an abuse of such right but unless we teach people what's good in our sense of morality they won't understand. So in a way we have to first give them the right to then make them understand why they can't use it how they like.",

I don't think they think<b>  a wom</b>an shouldn't get into office because of some underwear commercial.\n\n\"Just because you are female does not mean you are well educated on these kinds of issues.\" And just because you are well educated on an issue, doesn't mean you are correct on this issue. Being educated implies someone educated you, someone who could be wrong. So stop being so pedantic and rationally discuss the issue, instead of pointlessly judging people for \"not being educated\".",

While there is, of course, some validity in saying there exist people who are more or less educated, informed, or impacted by an issue, there must exist a line after which this litmus test (political, not chemical) goes from encouraging the populous to become educated, into degrading or demoting the vote and speech of everyone who disagrees with you under claims that boil down to \"everyone who disagrees with me must be too uneducated to have a meaningful opinion.\" I don't claim you have crossed that line in your comment, but when discussion strays near implying (through implicative patterns of speech) \"having (some opinion) means you are (or are not) educated\", many precautions must be taken to make sure we don't become enshrouded by our opinions like earplugs- they're so comfortable, and it's so much less comfortable to take them off, but the world continues around us whether we're listening or not.\n\nTo explain \"though implicative patterns of speech\": Essentially, you have applied the Kuleshov effect to your writing. Though you draw no pedantically provable connection between \"Just because a <b> woman </b>says stuff like this is okay, doesn't mean it is...\" and \"Just because you are female does not mean you are well educated on these kinds of issues\", their sequential use in speaking (and other speech-informed media like comments or film) is often assumed to draw a connection between one sentence and the next, and I think you'll agree there is a somewhat reasonable certainty that this was your intent (though again, of course, not pedantically provable).",

I wish the sexism/feminism debate used statistics, sadly the only ones that seem to be floating around are either completely wrong, or misleading and used out of context (ex. an earnings gap is not the same thing as a wage gap).  \n\nI also love the claim about how male geeks/nerds are now magically at the top of some social/cultural hierarchy.  There is a no group more picked on, ridiculed, or mocked than geeks.  There are entire shows that air weekly around making fun of geeks/nerds.  Long before Big Bang Theory there was Urkel to mock and denigrate vicariously.  Even the words geek and nerd were intended to be insults, until they were reappropriated...  Now I'm sure some people will make some comments about how female geeks have it harder than male geeks (or <b> black </b>geeks harder than white geeks), either way they are all scraping the bottom of the social barrel.  To claim that they are at the top of some social hierarchy is completely ludicrous, and flies in the face of all evidence.",

I've seen some experiments that attempt to test or measure latent biases, but in general these have only served to demonstrate that we as a species are programmed to react differently to people who are different, not because of our culture, but because of our biology, and I've only seen this demonstrated in extremely young people.",

The only reason of why STEAM fields are predominantly composed by male is because of women choice and there are not really any force that tries to decide for them. What we have here is a group of people with their own insecurities that want the rest of the world to please their needs. You ask if we are afraid to lose power...

But there's a fine line between appreciation and objectification. It's more easily defined as \"expression of the female body\" when it's a women doing the expressing, when it's on a woman's terms. That's a man, which changes the context. I COULD be wrong, but I'm confident the shirt is an example of objectifying women. Frankly I'd have no problem with the shirt, or occasional objectification, if genders were equally represented in that regard. Women are FAR more often objectified than men, which is where the real issue, for me, lies.",

Since you seem to be more concerned about who's wearing the shirt, than what's actually in the illustration.\n\nBetter question would be, that was the illustrator male, female or trans? And that shouldn't even matter, since artists intent cannot be grasped by some prejudice about his/her <b> race </b>or<b>  gender</b> etc., and furthermore, artists intent is many times irrelevant in art, and meant to be concealed, so that the piece would truly be open for audiences interpretation.\n\nOf course one can interpret the illustration's intent as objectification, but here people seem to lack the humility of seeing it as just their 5 cents. There are not many hard fast truths in interpretation, so it's alarming to me, that people are so quick and righteous in their anger. Having said that, I'm open to hearing your points that make you think or feel like the piece is objectifying.\n\nWhat exactly was naive in your opinion, since I had several thoughts? We might be talking about an actual character of some pop culture fiction, who has a persona and back story, and I find it concerning that people are so quick to anger about one superficial aspect, that \"pops\" to them from the illustration. In that case the interpretation debate is in vain, and we should just educate ourselves about the whole story, before making conclusions from \"a couple of still frames\" that we saw.\n\nNevertheless I stand by my view that by ignoring the context of helicopters, guns and explosions, people are oversimplifying art to be about something they project into it. In this case objectification. And to treat that as absolute truth is worrying.\n\nAs an artist, I find a gun such a strong symbol of self-determination, that for me it's very far fetched to interpret the picture derogatory towards th<b> e woma</b>n portrayed, or women in general. Art shouldn't be censored anyhow, where would that lead?\n\nSparking conversation is positive, if the conversation is constructive and productive - and if that has been the case, the piece might very well have served its purpose [optimistic speculation].",

Indeed a powerful piece, and one to cause emotional reactions and controversy.\n\nInteresting twist with the gun symbolism is, that a brainwashed soldier is a perfect example of 100% objectification and submission to hierarchy, be it voluntary or not, but without that context, a gun is an asset to its holder, and thus a symbol of liberty, equality (in terms of self defence) and personal power (also in terms of offence and abuse).\n\nAnd usually normal people are casually wearing pictures that they find admirable and beautiful, rarely to assert their dominance, even though the latter happens also.",

I can easily see that being the artistic intention. But it's not fair to discount the way I looked at it either, even if it was a snap judgment. It matters less that these kinds of conclusions are concerning, though they are, than the fact that these reactions exist. For that alone they cannot be ignored. Whatever people are projecting into the shirt is just another indication that something is going wrong--not that it's the shirt's fault. Really, with the majority of people looking at this image or others like it, most likely in passing, what are they going to think? That's a strong symbol of self-determination or that's another unrealistic depiction of beauty on some guy's shirt?\n\nAnd who is wearing the shirt is entirely relevant. Ignoring the fact that it is a man would be to ignore the patriarchal system we live in. I'll acknowledge that I have no idea about anyone's intentions with the creation or wearing of the shirt, but note that intention is meaningless in passing encounters. People will see what they see.\n\nThis conversation is evidence that this stuff is just tricky. I'd like to say that intention is an important thing--and in the right context it is. We can always look deeper. I'll concede to just about everything you said as a potentially precise interpretation, but the truth of the matter is that these things are open to interpretation and people just won't tend to look deeper. Also, I find this discussion (about the shirt in general, not exclusive to our part of it) not entirely warranted just because this shirt is just inconsequential compared to the much bigger fish to fry. That's in part because, you're right, we shouldn't be censoring art no matter what, and there's <b> nothing </b>we can do but critique it. Also in part because the thousand other reasons we still have a<b>  patriarchy</b>. BUT. You've had some interesting things to say, so it was worth my time.",

But does that mean that any expression of male heterosexuality is inherently mysogyinistic. I like media that contains images of sexualized women because I am heterosexual. Does that make me Sexist? Is it sexist of me to have those images viewable in public space? Is it only okay for me to like pictures of sexualized women and just hide that I like these images?\n\n\nI understand that these images can make women feel insecure. As a man I will never go through this to the same degree that women do. I do however feel insecure about my body image. I consider myself to be to <b> fat </b>to be liked by women. But I never would turn around and expect anyone to remove images that reinforce my insecurities. I think it's important for me to socialize myself in a way, were I can deal with my own insecurities and not get in the way of things that other people like. I am a big proponent of personal responsibility in this respect.

They are just bullies who hate men, picking on nerds or people who are \"antisocial\" has always been the norm for bullies.\n\nThe fact that mainstream media tries to pain them as righteous is the anomaly, not that bullies are attacking intellectuals.\n\n\nThe idea that he wore the shirt to assert his dominance over women is just stupid, stop pushing these absurd agendas. You yourself admitted that women contribute quantifiably less to science than men, on average they have lower IQ, and on average those in STEM have higher IQs. What you see as an oppressive system is really very simple statistics. The higher IQ you have the more you contribute, there are proportionally fewer females with high IQ than males, especially if you disregard soft sciences, you can plainly see that it's just statistics.\n\nLook at basketball, there are more blacks than whites. Wtf is with that shit? Obviously <b> racism </b>right? Well, maybe you should consider that<b>  black</b> people are on average taller than whites, so in a sport where being tall is an advantage, there are more tall people, and statistically, more blacks.\n\nFYI if something holds across all cultures, al<b> l ag</b>e groups, all demographics, then maybe it really <b> is gend</b>er insight. Compare Europe to Africa, the more \"equal\" a country is, the more freedom that people have to choose, the bigger the STEM \"gap\" is. In Africa people go where the money is, they don't have the luxury to make the choices they want. In Sweden for example, people can choose, and so they make their choice. Maybe it's time to just accept that \"male dominance\" in STEM is because men are not identical to women.\n\nNo one complains about female dominance in nursing, psychology, housewifing, teaching, etc.",

I don't know what happened exactly in this case but the recipients of the feminist wrath are bullied, harassed, deplatformed, disinvited and they sometimes loose their jobs. Should these men and sometimes women really be subjected to such punishment for dissenting opinions or how they express themselves? You suggests that the STEM fields being more attractive to males is just something we tell ourselves which is just not true. Men and women have different aptitudes and ambitions and therefore populate different fields plus women who are  very talented in science and technology are usually also talented in communication and might find more desirable to go into a different field. Lastly I just don't see how sexualized females in media is offensive and denigrating to women or might cause <b> sexism,</b> same as with violence there is no causation link that has ever been proven and I doubt it ever will. I think there is something to be said about unhealthy beauty standards but I believe both men and women can be strong enough to reject them.",

I can't believe this was almost 2 years ago!\n\nAlthough I more lean to the side of thinking that women don't go into STEM partly because of biology and partially because of the way society is set up. I also don't believe it's sexist. \n\nEquality is about equality of opportunity and not about equality of outcome, for example men certainly dominate in fields such as Maths and Physics, yet the opposite is true for Veterinary Sciences, Nurses and Clinical Laboratory Technologists where women take the majority. \n\nBoth men and women can go for the same subjects if they want, yet when given the same opportunities, there is still not equality of outcome. We don't seem to have a problem that only 9% of men go into nursing jobs, so why do we have a problem that women aren't going into other STEM subjects in the same number as men?\n\nAs for the shirt, probably not the best idea to wear it when appearing on live TV, but I don't have too much of a problem with it. It was actually a gift from a female friend of his. I think if a shirt depicting sexy cartoon women is enough to dissuade somebody from studying in STEM, then they can't have been that committed to that route in the first place.\n\n---\n\nAll in all, extremes are really annoying, on both sides. SJWs are ridiculous about most things and MRAs are just plain irritating most of the time. Let's just be reasonable and stay in the middle ground.",

It's all well and good to say don't discourage young girls from taking an interest in the space program but what about not discouraging them from doing arts. \"Do you like to draw pinup art deary? Oh well that's lovely: you draw so well. Just don't associate with men who share your interests. They're sexists.\" :D",

By saying that women bein<b> g sexua</b>l is sexist you actually make women think that they shouldn't expose their bodies. That by doing so they make themselves weaker and a target for violence. This is the same thinking that Islamists put out to push women to wear Burkas. Women don't go into STEM fields because those fields aren't interesting to women. The same reason why you don't see men going into Teaching, Child Care, Nursing, or even being stay at home dads. I think just calling the entire situation we have now \"Sexist\" is overlooking all the other factors that make this situation a reality and does a disservice to women who a<b> re sexu</b>al with their bodies.",

            "commentText": "Let me start by saying that I'm astounded that you (Nerdwriter1) are still taking the time to respond to comments on a video you made that is almost two years <b> old.</b> Good on you. I'm envious of your dedication.\n\nUltimately this video is discussing a specific example of a more general theory. In this case, many people looked at a shirt, decided that the 'message' conveyed by the shirt was sexist and supports the stereotype of a boys club. These people responded by attempting to point this 'message' out, no doubt hoping to help discredit the stereotype of the boys club, hopefully reducing any sexist barriers in place preventing women from entering stem fields. The sentiment rings with me. Fighting oppression is a good and honorable goal to have.\n\nThe problem I have isn't with the intentions, its with the theory itself. It sounds way to similar to the hypothesis that video games were making kids violent. Its the same fundamental idea. We have a cultural object that is assumed to have an impact on the way people think. In the case of the video a T-Shirt, in the case of the attempting banning of violent video games, it was the videogames themselves. People looked at the video games and saw the wanton violence and believed it was harming kids, making them more violent. People look at the shirt with scantily clad women on it and believe the shirt is making people more sexist, contributing to systems of oppression. In the case of video games, we know that the intuition people had was wrong. There is no good link between violence in video games and violence in real life. The cultural object failed to have the impact that the people assumed it would have. So given we can't trust our intuitions in the case of video games, how am I supposed to trust peoples intuitions when it comes to a shirt. Does the shirt contribute to the notion that science is a boys club? Is women's representation in science problematic and how does the shirt impact this representation? How am I to know?\n\nWhat I do know is that the man is not a shirt. The scientist, along with his team, achieved something incredible. They hit a bullet with another smaller bullet, landed successfully on a comet for the first time in human history. He was invited to speak for public new agencies, no doubt excited to share his passion with the world, to encourage young kids to imagine a future in which they too could be making groundbreaking scientific accomplishments, and rather than discuss the landing, the comet, astrophysics, science in general, he ended up being vilified for wearing a shirt that people didn't like. \n\nTLDR : Representation is far more complicated than any shirt, vilification of a fashion choice is insane to me.\n\nEDIT: To be clear, I'm not claiming that you or your video vilified the scientist. In fact, my post ignore the thesis of the latter half of your video. The idea that sexism/racism/etc is perpetuated because people like it is interesting if non-actionable. Honestly, I merely lament the fact that a shirt can get more coverage in the press and online than putting a lander on a comet.",

            "commentText": "Let's say your right. Let's all assume that the women of the world, those with any aspirations of ever entering STEM fields are so easily dissuaded by a shirt, that their biggest dreams become null. What does that say on this arguments ideas on these women with scientific goals? That they have no backbone? That they can't stand up and do whatever they want for themselves? If you are so easily turned away from the sciences, then maybe they just aren't for you. And yeah, STEM is a \"boys club\". So? So is garbage removal and construction, and no one ever raises an eyebrow about that. The sad fact is that different genders have different brains, fabricated by evolution; the evolution of a society, of psychology, and biology. This isn't a bad thing. Sure it means that men are more likely to take CEO jobs and STEM field jobs, but it also means they are more likely to die. And I would argue that that isn't an assumption. After all it is based on countless scholarly articles and alike. \n\nHere's some food for thought though; There seems to be ingrained systematic <b> sexism,</b> as well as other prejudice based -isms. In the case of<b>  sexism</b>, they can be explained by two different hypotheses. 1) Different evolutionary trends have developed different brains which make different choices which, for better or worse, create different trends of employment based o<b> n gende</b>r. 2) There is an ingrain<b> ed sexi</b>sm that causes the trends we see. And the biggest difference between these two ideas is the evidence. We can and have identified the evolutionary trends, so we know for a fact that they exist. What we have not done is identified the ingrai<b> ned sex</b>ism, because as you say yourself , it is \"invisible\". So invisible that they are, in fact, undetectable, immeasurable, except for the outcome they predict, a society that seems to have an ingra<b> ined se</b>xism, and that would prove it's existence if not for the other hypothesis.\n\nNow there are two explanations, one with evidence to back it up all along the way, and the other with an assumption as it's base. Occam's razor tells us that the hypothesis with the least amount of assumptions is more likely to be correct and therefore should be operated with, and as such, the second hypothesis is eliminated. So although the explanation is not simple, it allows us to really understand that there is no syste<b> matic s</b>exism in the first world. And really think about it for a second; if I told you that an invisible, intangible flying spaghetti monster was having a great influence on all of my ideas and perceptions of other people, then you would tell me that I was a moron, and rightly so. Now obviously this comparison is no more than hyperbole to extenuate the evidence based flaws in your argument.\n\nSo, if you can prove that what we observe in soci<b> ety is </b>sexism, and you can make that argument with logic and evidence, and not just with logic as you have been doing, then I would happily consider thinking it over in greater detail, and probably put a lot of deep thought into which explanation was more likely to be true, which fit our model of society better, but until anyone can do that, I will remain stoic in my understanding. If anyone disagrees with me, and would like to have a civil discussion about the topic, I would be more than happy to oblige/",

How on earth is a woman's comfortability with her body and her sexuality tied to her ability to solve physics or math problems? Women aren't in STEM because they grew up being told that they're not supposed to be good at math and science, NOT because they are living in a society more open to female sexuality. This guy's work has <b> nothing </b>to do with the women on his shirt because one's physical appearance and one's<b>  mental</b> abilities aren't at all related.

Society does create <b> gender </b>roles but noone is forced to follow them. This becomes evident when you see home schooled girls of the same family go into entirely different fields. One went to the army and the other wants to nurse and be a housewife. Society does not prescribe to women their interests, society sells them what they have decided to be interested in. Its people like you who remove the responsibility from women and all of humanity alike by building a boogeyman made of white cis males. I don't lose anything by women going into Stem. I fucking hate Stem. But I love video games and football and reading about history as well. My stereotypes run abound from<b>  fat</b> nerd to sports nut and around the block again picking and choosing my interests from what society sells me. I was never forced into these things, and for those of us lucky enough to have a normal childhood we all buy what we like from society and the fact that 25% of women do go into Stem shows you that society does not prohibit women from doing it, women as the individuals they are just don't take stem as their interest as often. Ultimately shirtgate and the idea that someone else (white males) are actively rooting for women to stay out of Stem on the whole is absurd and only serves to prove that feminism and social justice don't believe in a woman's right to choose but instead their right to choose for women on the whole. As you so easily dismissed those women who have raised themselves above being influenced by a man's shirt, or attributing any power to it. No one makes women not go into Stem besides the people who would also make them not be a housewife because they see it as degrading, society doesn't build the narrative, people buy whatever they feel like best suits them. Constructive people realize you don't have to be even close to as shallow and confined as a human being, as Social justice warriors would tell you to be.",

Without which we go extinct.They are naturally less likely to take risks in all areas like things that are dirty (germs) difficult (stressful) and dangerous (death) and risk in general. But those are things that make work valuable. The system you fight is nature and womb-men uphold that nature not men.

It is right to be annoyed by that. \n\nIf instead of assuming that many girls would be discouraged of following STEM because a shirt sends a message, how about the amount of girls that would be encouraged by talking about landing a satellite in a comet? \n\nI completely get by people getting angry at the sj police. The angry people on the internet, the internet commentators, they  don't create value. What comes trough, is the complete disregard for the actual fact, as in the sexist shirt discussion is more important than anything the guy was actually there to talk about. It is stealing the spotlight. \n\nI would say that a scientist saying bad shit about women is a first order <b> sexism.</b> He, personally, is being responsible for pushing women out of science. A scientist that inadvertently gives lower grades to womem would be second order.  What do you think that a guy wearing a colourful shirt, that-if-you-really-look-at-it-you-realise-it-has -women-depicted-in-sexualised-poses, is? \n\nMy point is that we are all in this treadmill, we all live in a sexist society and we all perpetuate these ideas.  Why is this of any importance or deserves any media coverage when everyone else contributes to<b>  sexism</b> in some way or the other. \n\nSo was this guy moving forward women in science? no.

It's a human problem). If anything, I just think of it as a celebration of the female body. ;)\n\nI think you're right about prejudice being \"enjoyable\" though. It sure seems like it is the way that some people are so obsessed with holding on to it and it's odd how angry people get when you challenge their stance. Everyone likes to feel superior in some way and holding biased beliefs about how much \"better\" or \"smarter\" or \"right\" you are than another group is an easy way to do it. I think what lies at the heart of prejudice is scapegoating. People are so unwilling to see their own flaws that it's much easier and more comforting to replace self awareness about one's own shortcomings with a false sense of superiority or even self pity, thus avoiding growth. I can't tell you how many men I've encountered who believe their non existent <b> sex </b>life is due to \"feminism\" or how many unemploymed Trump supporters think their situation is due to immigration. Scapegoating is all it ever is. If only we lived in a world where people had truly open minds and open hearts. Sometimes I think humanity is not capable of that kind of self awareness.",

I am aware of some MGTOWs, that have an overlap with MRA groupings, that are hyper-aware of the trend of female hypergamy, all the way up to women simply marrying the state. And the intricate way that men, doing there biological best to be supporters, now support a system that women use to subjugate, and dispossess men. Male taxes are the only reason that social services have funding in front of the outgoing curve. Men fund this system. And the supply the vast majority of its enforcement staff. It's to the point in the new tribal mind of the <b> woman </b>now, that the system is her best friend, not her husband (yes, generalizing). So she can go get knocked up with that thuggish dude, ditch that sucker and have the collective man pay her way. There is an broader disconnect between the instincts that women have to select men, in the civilization they inhabit. They aren't useless instincts. But it all plays into the intricate structure of men subjugating themselves to female bidding. And for men to get the thanks in return, that the system they die to uphold is.... misogynistic. Which is of course, just part of the big sympathy dance to keep men on the ball upholding it. Trained morons, sleepwalking into the mincer.\n\nI too, I'm a general disregarder of labels. General. As long as a label is kept pure and unencumbered by bullshit academic baggage, I'm unphased. Like Egalitarian. I'm pretty certain, that the wanktacular lecturers that would ever attempt to parasistically attach all their pseudo-scientific blather onto it, would be arbitrarily disregarded. Unlike Feminism, it actually IS just the dictionary definition. You believe in a society that is demographically<b>  blind</b> in doling out resource and opportunity. End of.\n\nWhen you speak of \"allegiances\" this to me, also hits at the finer point of misguidance. When you make a label, it becomes a banner. Groups operate under the banner, and it becomes tribal. Us and them. Are you with us or not? And yes, I take the same lens to MRA's, when it comes to association with a group rather than a keen focus on policy. And it's from this outlook, without any sentimental favor about the trends and traits within, that I thoroughly reject the notion that MRA's bare a resemblance to Feminists, just from the other direction. Even if I think the title \"MRA\" is the muddled \"course correction\" same as Feminism has a sided nomenclature, in practice the two camps behav<b> e nothin</b>g alike. The MRA's are very DEconstructionist of the flawed methodology of the evangelizing feminists, who tell a tale that's about as complex as a cartoon. They're a conflicted Grrl power fantasy, demanding society be constantly to the rescue of these hyperpowerful heroines. Which begs of the men, to come rescue them from the evils of men. And then fuck off because it's all men's fault, and we didn't need your help. To analyse, the general trends and traits of Feminism are fuck-ing-in-sane. Not hyperbole. IN-SANE. The MRA's, while they may have the odd gaf or blunder, are hugely founded in comparative reality. They take a solemn, realist look at the nature of maledom and femaledom, and the delusions that people have about the structures they inhabit. But they never act like men are perfect, or incapable of going haywire. Even in shit like Domestic Violence. The MRA's push an honest attempt to understand the dynamics and the potential solutions, while recognizing the fallibility and accountability of all. In the mind of the Feminist, there's no delusion too great, to canonize women and demonize men. And this delusional state, is the status quo.\n\nSo me? I too prefer a focus upon policy over labels, because policies exist in their own form. They don't lug around the baggage. People play spitball on labels.\n\nIt all depends on how you define privilege and oppression. When you see MRA's talking about oppression, what they're generally doing, is deploying the Feminist's own index against them. They think that their \"Wage Gap\" fantasy is a signifier of oppression. And at no time will they ever bring up the Workplace death gap. And what broader dynamics surround it? What does a man have to do to not be alienated from his children? I mean, Men are usually the providers, which makes her the presumed carer. She throws a tantrum and wants out? Well court rules on her side. So you better work, man. And what work is available for you? Keep chasing that dollar down the mine-shaft. You might die, but your wife wont leave you. Or will she? She might just complain that while you're paying the bills you're not there, so she fucks the polite neighbor that she borrows sugar from. And divorces you and marries the state anyway.\n\nMRA's are usually taking their yadstick of oppression, and applying it to men, to show how ridiculous their claims are in a vacuum. And also how biased their application is. Take Domestic Violence. Feminists broaden the terms to the extent that they're nearly meaningless. And when they do, the guilt that women would accrue under their loosened standard is off the charts. But... It's only Domestic Violence when men do it. This is LITERALLY the only way they can mentally reconcile their lunacy. And when they apply this biased metric, they continue to use words like \"equality\", with a straight face.\n\nSo what is oppression? Women have genital integrity enshrined in law. Men? Got VAWA? Got primary aggressors and guilty pleas for corrective programs? Got basically every men's group listed as \"Hate Groups\" on the classic comedy troupe over at SPLC?\n\nAnita Sarkeesian has the ear of the UN committee to complain the people don't like her on the internet. Because harassment and trolling on the internet is a women's issue. And anyone with two peanuts to roll around upstairs would really compare feminists to MRA's. For various reasons, including the name, I wouldn't use the name. But as a broad overview of mentality, advocacy and representatives? MRA's to Feminists are like comparing rigorous scientists to spoilt lunatics.",

I doubt they'll let you in, but you can try.\n\nMen make up the majority of the working force and pay the most taxes, but men usually also get the most in return. If a man choose to share the capital they earned through hard work with a <b> woman,</b> then that is their choice. It's not like there is a law that obligates you to do so. The only argument you guys gets rests on divorce settlements, but prenuptial agreements are a thing, remember? Plus you don't HAVE to get married to be in a relationship.\n\nI believe in a society where everyone is equal under the law, and everyone is responsible for their own problems. It's not the government's job to make sure enough women to choose a stem career, that's women's own responsibility. It's not the government's job to make sure you make your wife sign a pre-nup, that's your own responsibility.\nYou see how this works? I believe that as long as everyone is equal under the law, everyone is responsible for their own lives.\nSo no, I'm not an \"Egalitarian\". If a demographic ends up worse than some other demographic even though they have the same rights, then that is not a problem for the government to solve, it's a problem for that demographic to solve.\n\nI can't lie, this: \"They're a conflicted Grrl power fantasy, demanding society be constantly to the rescue of these hyperpowerful heroines.\"\nIs a pretty accurate description of a lot of women in the western world. \"I'm strong and independent, but please pay my bills.\"\nBut like I said, if you don't like it then simply stop paying their bills, or stop dating shallow arrogant cunts. It's that simple. \n\n\"So me? I too prefer a focus upon policy over labels, because policies exist in their own form. They don't lug around the baggage. People play spitball on labels.\"\n\nExactly, which is one of the reasons why I do not support any special interest group, even the ones that are in my favour. Why would I poison my own well? Plus special interest groups are usually willing to sacrifice what's good for the whole of society, for the specific interrests of their individual group, which I find morally and intellectually reprehensible.\n\n\"They think that their \"Wage Gap\" fantasy is a signifier of oppression. And at no time will they ever bring up the Workplace death gap.\"\n\nBoth the wage gap and the workplace death gap can be explained away by personal choice. I don't think either is a problem.\n\nLook I understand the argument, I use examples like that as arguments myself. However the difference is, I end my argument by saying that I believe neither is a problem, which a lot of MRA's don't. They just want to replace the thing we're supposed to whine about, instead of wanting everyone to stop whining all together.\n\n\"She might just complain that while you're paying the bills you're not there, so she fucks the polite neighbor that she borrows sugar from. And divorces you and marries the state anyway.\"\n\nWell sounds like you chose to marry a shallow cunt, instead of someone who loves you the way you love her. The situation you described is awful indeed, however it is your responsibility to not marry a fucking cunt. You don't just marry all of a sudden, do you? You get years to get to know a person before you marry them, that's plenty of time for you to figure out whether or not they're a cunt.\n\n\"So what is oppression?\"\nOppression is having someone else decide what you can and can't do, without having a choice in the matter. Which is something we rarely see in the western world.\n\n\"Anita Sarkeesian has the ear of the UN committee to complain the people don't like her on the internet\"\n\nMate you don't got to convince me that the UN is horrible, I already agree with you.

                    "commentText": "@Kenny Naicuslik \nIn the grand arc of tax distribution, women are far and away the greater recipients of benefit from men's earnings. A study of several western nations performed recently showcase what many of us already suspected. That women are literally behind the curve in tax contribution. As an aggregate accumulation over their lifetime, women don't break even in the tax line. As the major beneficiaries alongside being the minor contributors, they are highly privileged in the western world, without even an obligation to any specific male that provides for them. That's not to say that the benevolent social structures of the west don't benefit men, too. But we're talking aggregate distribution of benefit here.\n\nYou're overlooking the degree of interference in parts of the western world. Where the government actually DOES see it as their job to act on women's behalf to enact \"de facto\" legislation. Where I live, are subjected to spousal claims simply for living with a <b> woman.</b> She could just as easily claim it. The governement effectively marries you without your consent, and makes all the same \"what's yours is mine\" provisions available to a divorcing<b>  woman</b>.\n\nAnd your prenuptual agreements are frequently made a mockery of pragmatic reality.\n\nWhat you're describing actually is egalitarian. A more Anarchic iteration of Egalitarian. I'm not out to brand anyone. But Egalitarian, isn't to be mistaken for the \"equity\" farce of modern feminism, that incessantly tries to make it everyones business to account for the demographies. Do we see feminists complaining about privilege for the hyper-successful Asian communities? Fark no. Work ethic is so deeply ingrained in their culture, that it leads them to excel. But they're also what they'd consider a<b> n ethni</b>c minority many of the places they are, so they're an aberration to the feminists' mer<b> ry ment</b>al distortions.\n\nI also have a certain provision to the notion of opportunity when it comes to demographies as well. I don't support demographic recognition before the law, or before social programs, or quotas and any of that drivel. All the same, I don't think their are social programs that can be rightly enacted, to account for past failures of discriminating government policy. That have set certain regions and cultures on a trajectory, that is very downward. This kind of momentum, can't be underestimated. Once you achieve a more enlightened social structure to enable opportunity for all demographies, they have to take a role in this. But the generational repurcussions of past mistreatment can be longstanding, and a gradual healing process to lift wrongly treated communities back up. And to reiterate, making the terms of a program that brings this help to communities Demography based, is a benevolently misguided disaster in process. There's no accounting for what kind of demographic aberration you could be inadvertently carving out of assistance with dumbass demographic pandering. And all the same, if the assistance is mismanaged with patronizing lack of account, you end up doing more harm to trigger dependency than good.\n\nIt's not me we're talking about on this front. And the context is far large than guys who submit themselves to female hypergamy and chivalry. Chivalry isthe ironic mechanism that pervades western society all the way up through law making and social provisions. We're not talking about the agency of one guy. We're talking about the gynocratic government that guysare subjected to. Which to be honest, doesn't actually phase me. Gynocratic care is an natural development from a biological imperative. The beef with the whole operation, is the double-think, dishon<b> est misan</b>dry that goes along with the bogus operation. It's not enough that women get to be the primary concern for society. Men don't even get a fuck you very much in the process. It's about as insulting as it could be. Men slave their guts out, in major discomfort and frequent death, to do honor to their lady-folk. So they can get back to the nest, flick on the tube and be endlessly informed about what horrible piece of shit they are, and how do women put up with you? Those powerful and independent women that can do it all themselves. Men in western society, are bombarded with a ceaseless torrent of insult, that is so deafening to behold, that you eventually become death to it. And many live out their whole lives, laboring under this bad joke. \n\nExactly, which is one of the reasons why I do not support any special interest group, even the ones that are in my favour. Why would I poison my own well? Plus special interest groups are usually willing to sacrifice what's good for the whole of society, for the specific interrests of their individual group, which I find morally and intellectually reprehensible.\n\n\nThis, further elaborates why I too steer clear of labels and banners. It's like selecting a team, and once you select a team, it's as if you're acting in accordance with what benefits that team, instead of the honest truth of the bigger picture. This much I fully concur with as a mechanism. That said, there is still a high range of insight you can draw about the different ascribed teams and banners. And the legitimacy of their conduct.\n\nPrecisely again. The key point here isn't of course that men don't choose to do the dangerous work that gets them killed. That IS precisely the point, and we're talking about the selective inclusionism and interpretation of data in pursuit of a slanted agenda. Yes, men CHOOSE to do this work. And it has many implications. Firstly, if men didn't do it, it wouldn't get done. Period. The men I've worked at in different jobs instinctively and obviously know this. We used to joke about handing off gigantic steel rods to the women that would come down from reception. No dice. Women have become conditioned to live under a shelter of civilization, provided by male work, that they take for granted. As if they're children that interpret food as this thing that comes from the grocery store. And they're often full of egocentric stream from this girl-power cartoon that installed their attitude. And keen to tell the world how awesome they are. Including the guys that dynamited the tunnel she's driving through, in the air-conditioned car that's powered by the petroleum that was accessed and refined by male labor. This begins to encapsulate what is meant by the \"infantilization\" of women. The obnoxious patterns that are socially accepted, to conditioned women into clueless brats. And of course, this only speaks of that hearty supply of women who have boughtinto this bullshit. Their are in fact, plentiful women out there, that get it. Really get it. The bigger picture of how the genders depend and compliment each other. But the media isn't too keen on giving them a voice. Reality is offensive.\n\nIn some ways, maybe. But the thing to recognize, is the searing ways the MRA's are actually right. One rational stopping point could be an anarchic egalitarian structure, and everyone fends for themselves. However, we're not even remotely their in legislative terms. Feminists are petitioning<b>  for NOT</b>HING that is relevant to legal opportunity. They think because bad things happen to women, that this shows society is misogynistic, and that rape culture is a thing, and the society enables this attitude towards women. The great irony being from the MRA camp, that they can actually prove that this is true regarding males. Feminists petition under a banner of female bias that is so phenomenal, that they've been able to run amok and life-ruin on the power of a say-so. But males are privileged. Trash like the VAWA bill, and Primary Aggressor laws. When the real MRAs talk, they mean serious business. Not \"whaaa, the interwebz didn't wike me!\". No, they have a knack for potent illustrations of legally enacted discrimination. Like for one example, Mike Buchanan's standing offer for Feminists to refute every time he gets on a panel with them. And all they can ever do is ramble and deflect. It's such a watertight document to tackle.\n\nHis organization outlines 20 specific, demonstrable areas that the law \"assaults\" the rights of men and boys, comparative to women and girls. He gladly offers his ear to hear them both refute these examples as written to the letter of the law. And encourages them to offer a single legal example where males are advantaged. A HARD, written, legislated example.\n\nAn example from his side would be, the females are legally assured of genital integrity. Its on the books, as a matter of female concern.\nI think there's a better solution than that. Don't get married at all. This social structure that males are raised under, is basically designed to direct them like cattle to the killing floor. Conditioning them with all the high ideals the please and impress women. And as a collective, men compete against each other i<b> n the</b> race to the killing floor, instead of uniting as a collective, to put all this bullshit on ice.\n\nAs someone once wisely illustrated. The rampant feministic abuse of men in society, can only be sustained with the complicity of men. It's a structure of ingrained thought control and indoctrination that begins early. Works really well now, with the number of guys raised by the venerated \"single mommy\". That probably began as a marriage. And retains the petitioned ideal of a marriage. And as I've remarked often, that if males ever awoke to, and balked at the nature of the whole system. If they went on strike for ONE day about it. This shit stops, tomorrow.\n\nMen, are the conditioned tool to keep men under control. And as long as their is enfranchisement without responsibility (most women shouldn't even have the vote. Not because they're women, but because their suffrage has no responsibility. Those Israeli women though? There's some badass women there).\n\nThe MGTOW movement is one of the only ways to avert the oppressive impositions, that are continually closing in on, and interfering with relationships. And the great irony is, it's a lose-lose. Women will ultimately fuck themselves over. Like Janet Bloomfield points out. Women will wise the fuck up, once they've aliented the western males, and made way for an <b> ACTUAL patr</b>iarchy to take over. And their memories of the freedom they squandered will fade in misery.\n\nI don't \"participate\" in the special interest groups. But I'm fine to take stock of the merit of their activities.\n\nYou know, it's a kind of alright to talk with someone switched on Naicuslik. You should stay in touch, we can form a special, special interest group.",

Advocating for the goverment to treat men and women equally, or the fact that they dare to say men face issues as well?\n\nLet's see, men get longer sentencing for the same crime and in some countries women are not included in the definition of rape (meaning they get even less time).\n\nThe man has no right to decided if he wants to be a father, while the women can. I believe in abortion, and I also believe that the father should have the same time frame to say that they don't want to be a parent...\n\nUnder the domestic violence laws called the 'Duluth Model', which I know Australia and Briton work under, the man is assumed to be the perpetrator even if they are abused by the women. After all, all domestic violence stems from men's desire to control women. Women can never be evil, and if they hurt a man, the Duluth Model proposes that it was the fault of the man. I shit you not, this was conceived and implemented by feminists.\n\nI know in Australia, the government funded;\n-The National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children ($119.5 million over four years) \n-The National Awareness Campaign to Reduce Violence Against Women ($30.0 million over three years)\n-And on men? 0\n\nIn the UK, the amount of male domestic abuse shelters pales in comparison to the amount of female ones. No thanks to feminists, might I had... Erin Pizzey, the first women to create a domestic abuse shelter in UK, was harassed by feminists because she dared to suggest that maybe they should help men too. Please, search up her story, she is a true hero that helped victims and yet was ostracized when she suggested helping men\n\nNow, just to clarify, this is not me saying all feminists are evil. Or that all are 'delusional'. Not all feminists follow the same ideas, and many truly want equality, but often get caught up focusing on only one <b> gender </b>and not listening to the other side, dismissing them as 'delusional' as you did. MRA's are not all delusional. Men DO face serious issues that are not addressed, and some feminists, weather or not you explain how they are Not True Scotsmen, had a hand in it. So please, don't dismiss those who advocate for men's rights just because you were told they are all<b>  crazy</b>. I know I don't, I just want the issues I highlighted above addressed.",

You don't have to behave as nature says. We don't live in the nature. Nature also says that we should let the weak ones die, that doesn't mean we should do it. Nature says men should rape females to give offsprings, that doesn't mean it's true. Nature also says if you wanna take dump, just stop and take dump in the middle of the street, that doesn't mean we should do it.\nWhat a lot of anti-feminists don't understand is that you can't argue with what nature says, simply because we have made this civilization by overcoming our instincts and becoming INTELLIGENT species. Now we have to build our \"nature\", our rules. And we already have. We have built hospitals to care for people who, according to nature, should die. I'm sorry to say this, but implying that everything in nature is right and humans should act as nature tells is stupid and hypocrite. It's just another excuse to ignore nowadays' problems and go like \"Oh it's in the nature so it's normal\".\nI'm not an MRA, because I'm not an activist, I just don't care. But I think feminists have beaten the same dead horse for years and it has led to a society that criticizes and hates female discrimination while thinking that the men are privileged. And of course, this much attention to female rights causes ignorance toward men's rights. Now that feminists have fought fo<b> r woma</b>n rights, it's<b>  a wom</b>an's birthright to have children but fuck men, they don't love children, they aren't parents they are just unemotional perverts who only w<b> ant </b>sex. \n\nMaybe MRAs or feminists are annoying but if there were more MRAs, everything would be more balanced.\n\nSometimes I agree with anti-feminists who say that women have equal rights, but I know for sure that people are ignorant when they say that men have no problems and are privileged.

It's survival of the FITTEST, not survival of the STRONGEST. The fittest in a western 21th century society would the smartest and most creative. And those people do indeed appeal more to most women. Most women would fuck a brainsurgeon over a trashman even if the trashman is \"stronger\" or more attractive.\n\n\".Men are stronger and therefore they are the ones that should care about the family?\"\n\nMen are more ambitious which is why they are usually responsible for the largest portion of a family's income. Of course this isn't always the case and a lot of women do pursue a career over a family. That's their right if it it makes them happy they should by all means do it.

If we st<b> ayed </b>dumb we wouldn't be compassionate\"\n\nNo it IS in our nature, the intelligent thing is often not the compassionate thing. If we were truly rational enlightened beings like you claim we are we would be going around making intelligent decisions rather than compassionate decisions. For example, if you strand on an island without food with 10 other people the intelligent thing would be to eat the person with the smallest chance of surviving so the other 9 can survive.

My point is that everyone should have freedom to do whatever they want. Men have the right to be feminine or masculine and women have the right to be feminine and masculine. When I say \"the right\" I mean they can do it without being criticized or hated by society. That's what feminists and MRAs fight for. When they see a standard traditi<b> onal w</b>oman who prefers kids over career they don't complain about that.\n\n\"No it IS in our nature, the intelligent thing is often not the compassionate thing. \" You got me wrong. \"Intelligent\" does not mean smart, it means a higher brain capacity, capable of interacting with the world on a higher level. When you see someone being stabbed your high capacity brain has the \"power\" to imagine the same thing happening to you which makes you feel compassionate. Other animals don't know what compassion is because their brain isn't smart enough to think of something else than the survival of their own body. Humans don't have the compassion in their DNA. When we evolved from apes to humans our cells didn't just suddenly start changing our DNA. \n\n\">\"Hey guys, half the town is on fire!

I don't agree that feminism is abstract. It's not abstract, it's just people who disagree with it are too hateful. For example you. I don't want to offend you but I don't see real argument here, only insults.\n\n\"That prevents any \"us vs them\" thinking sneaking into your mind.\" Ok, I'll agree here. Feminists fight for women's right but then organize parties and events \"ONLY FOR WOMEN\". So they want to make everyone equal by segregating them from men even more, which is plain stupid.\n\n\"No, you';re not. Egalitarians are not MRA's.\" Egalitarians are people who think that everyone is equal. MRAs are Men's rights ACTIVIST. ACTIVISTS. People who FIGHT for those rights. Having an opinion and fighting for that opinion are two different things. I don't fight for men's rights but I agree that men and women should be equal.\n\n\"Special interest groups will without exception eventually try to execute plans that help the members of their group while hurting every other group.\" So? There are people who help kids in Africa or workers in third world countries by damaging our economy. Of course the damage isn't that huge but it's still there. I guess I'll repeat my balance theory here. If you get another group to balance the \"fight\" everything will be fine.\n\n\"Because feminists represent the interests of women AT THE COST of the interests of men, while MRA's do the exact opposite.

It is a special interest groups and those are always bad for society as a whole.\n\n\"So they want to make everyone equal by segregating them from men even more, which is plain stupid.\"\n\nSo what you are saying is that special interest groups will do things for the betterment of their particular group, while hurting all other groups.....? Which is the literal reason I gave you for why I'm against special interest groups...\n\n\" MRAs are Men's rights ACTIVIST. ACTIVISTS. People who FIGHT for those rights.\"\n\nI don't give a damn what you call it, it's still a special interest group.\n\n\"Having an opinion and fighting for that opinion are two different things.\"\n\nFor anyone who isn't a hypocrite they aren't.\n\n\"So? There are people who help kids in Africa or workers in third world countries by damaging our economy.\"\n\nThose people help those kids by giving them shoes, food and clothing. That's very good for those children, the people that special interest group is trying to help. It is absolutely terrible for the country those children live in though. It ruins their entire economy by putting all grocery stores, clothing stores and shoe manufacturers out of business. The example you just gave me is the perfect example for why you SHOULDN'T look at what's best for a group, but at what's better for society as a WHOLE.\n\n\"If you get another group to balance the \"fight\" everything will be fine.\"\n\nNo, it won't be. You're an idiot if you think it will be. You will end up with a shitload of laws that oppress men, and an equal amount of laws that oppress women. The end result is more oppression, not less.\n\n\"and everyone else doesn't care about men's/women's rights, who should do something about these issues??\"\n\nWhoever cares. Just don't be a part of a special interest group, that's all. You can be in favour of a bill that makes men and women more equal without being a feminist or MRA. That's important because otherwise you will start supporting bullshit like affirmative action because you think it makes people \"more equal\" while in reality it makes them less equal.",

It would seem that the suffix \"-gate\" will in the future be considered proper English when referring to a scandalous event. Hell, the word gate in itself may eventually change its meaning to be synonymous with scandal. Through out human history, older generations have always complained about how younger generations speak, but eventually that becomes the norm and then the cycle begins a new. My suggestion is stop complaining and just realize it's a part of natural linguistic evolution. The way we speak now would be unrecognizable to English speakers a millenium ago or even 500 years ago and it's the same vice versa. Only time will tell what English will be like centuries from now, but this is how it starts.",

Due to technology companies and university's being so desperate for more women in stem. There being less women in stem fields isn't<b>  sexism</b> it's just that men tend to pick stem jobs. Same reason why their are more female nurses, evolutionary women's role where to care for their children so that her genes could get passed on through her kids. So essentially evolutionary women's primary role was to be a caretaker, that crosses over to the modern world and that why their are more female nurses because a good section of a nurses job is taking care of their patient's.",

(2) structurally it is easier for a <b> woman </b>to become a nurse as opposed to a man since cultural biases EXPECT women to enter the field, so resources and opportunities are catered towards them in this sense; however, there are tons of male nurses! and this statistic is only growing (3) I can tell you that nursing is a far stretch from caregiving! I have worked in the ER and I can tell you that both female and male nurses have to acquire a set of skills to be efficient. taking care of children is very very different from drawing blood from your patients or setting up IV, so you can't make that comparison! \"care\" can be a very detached and specialized set of skills",

The people that think women are weak minded are the ones mad at the shirt. I for one know women can take care of themselves and don't need me to be a white knight and come to their rescue. If a shirt can turn you away from a career then maybe you didn't want it all that bad. Does no one see the hypocrisy in starting women are equal to men and then say we must protect them as if they were children.",

Now it just means any male who expresses feminist opinions, regardless of how many women agree with him.

(reinforced by TV/media/other agents that surround us all the time)? be made-up,<b>  sexual</b>, have a good body, etc., and it's often shown that borderline rapey contexts are attractive. purely externally based. men on the other hand, there are plenty of examples where the physically unattractive intellectual is still attractive to others because of his mind (sherlock? romanticizing alan turing? any troubled intellectual protagonist - crime and punishment? any james joyce book?). so the male mind can be attractive, and internal substance can override external appearance. i have never seen this concept for females, ever! (if you have please point me to it, i would be so happy to consume some kind of media that glamorizes the intellectual female mind!) \nthere's two concrete problems from this that i can pinpoint. everyone wants to be attractive! for men, they can still be ambitious and serious, and the attractiveness will come from their success or intellectual capabilities and that's totally fine. their success ENHANCES their attractiveness. a successful and brigh<b> t woma</b>n will have to COMPROMISE her attractiveness to reach the same level. so it's a sacrifice for her. since it's a benefit for men and a sacrifice for women, it's only natural that more men would be ambitious and driven than women in that sense in this day a<b> nd a</b>ge. here's a logistical issue. maintenance for male attractiveness is very low in time and money it takes. females on the other hand have to invest actual time, resources, and money to maintain their conventional attractiveness, and that's time away from success! i'm serious. if you look at the amount of time women collectively spend on their external appearance, and if you think about all that time and energy being diverted to some kind of intellectual pursuit, there would be such a massive shift in female success! and why are they so strongly conditioned towards maintaining this standard of external appearance? because of media!\nit's a more complex issue than you paint it as, and it's worth thinking about a little more. interesting stuff.",

You act as though objectification of ONLY women in marketing and otherwise is ubiquitous, as though every person isn't objectified. Undoubtedly, women have this occur more, a neurological study showed even women view other women as objects at a much higher rate than men. I think it's a mistake to view this as a problem, however. If we did not do this, we would pick very poor mates for breeding. Research shows that \"attractive\" features and \"healthy\" features are one and the same. If we are to change how sensitive a world we live in, define the terms. How far do we go? Do we silence our comedians? Our politicians are so afraid to offend, they speak often and say very little. It's what makes Trump look refreshing despite being an idiot.

Kim K's photoshoot has <b> nothing </b>to do with Matt Taylor choosing to wear a shirt, and yet the comparison was made based on \"The potential damage it did to girls\" Why are we blaming these people for how 'damaged' girls are? I don't obviously mean just these two people, I mean this is a trend where we hold an incredibly small fraction of society to this standard where what they do must benefit what we want. In which case, their actions and what they mean to them individually means<b>  nothing</b> to us, and the image of their actions and how we can consume them means everything to us. Matt Taylor does not exist, and neither does Kim Kardashian, at least not in a way that respects who they are as individuals. They only exist as a collection of meanings, feelings, and ideas that we have about ourselves and superimposed over and upon them.

So girls and guys and everyone else like dressing sexy in cosplay, which is good for them, because they are a human being that decided for themselves to dress like that, and they wanted to feel sexy. But when men create a female character that is hyper <b> sexual,</b> then you can't say its a person making a choice for themselves, because its a person giving a fictional character this hyper<b>  sexual</b> persona. And this wouldn't be a problem, because there ar<b> e woma</b>n who like bei<b> ng sexu</b>al, if it weren't for the over abundance of this. Artists, unless they are going for the opposite, usually portray what they think is the 'ideal', and this has been that way for like centuries, back to the  Paleolithic era. Male artists will portray women<b>  as </b>sex symbols and men muscly because thats the ideal to them. However, at least for straight men, they identify as the men, and portray the ideal of what they wish they were, and the women as what they wish they had. Like how in comic books for many decades (recently they have made changes tho) every single female character was designed as hyper sexualized in revealing outfits and heels and such. They gave not nearly enough variety in women as men did, with some men being supermen and some being doomsday. If they had some women in hyper sexualized outfits and some in more modest clothing, it would be fine, but they didn't, and instead created a culture where a majo<b> rity w</b>oman had to wear this tiny skirts and heels to be heroes or important.\n\nAnd yeah, men can be sexualized too, and it does happen, but to the overwhelming extent that women are. And some women do like this sexualized culture, but a lot of women don't, and can't really escape it. A lot of women who find hyperventilation disempowering will always feel that way because so much of media and society is misogynistic. It also creates expectaions for men that women will never reach, because they are fed ideals made by other men, that are so over abundant in our culture they aren't seen as ideal, but the norm.\n\nTLDR Women being portrayed as sexy and half naked are called out for being harmful towards women because there isn't enough variety and e<b> nough </b>woman NOT being hyper sexualized, while men do have that variety. In real life, people do make the choice to be sexy and thats okay. Women like Bayonetta because Bayonetta is a good game.",

But I don't think there will ever be an 'enough', people will still make sexist portrayals and people will complain about everything, we'll never be perfect. But I guess the realistic ideal for portrayal of women in games and such is when the hyper sexualized <b> woman </b>isn't the norm, and it's more equal to the portrayal of men now. I don't think it's an issue even of \"Men making Games/art/movies are all perverted and only protray women as<b>  sex</b> objects!\" but for most creators making these hype<b> r sexua</b>l women, its just always been the norm, since the days of women not being allowed to make these kinds of things, and men just stayed with this flow. And now these discussions and converstions have people realizing that maybe its not okay to always make women always super sexy, but to branch out and make different types of women.\n\nAlso, kind of seperate to address your last issue, but I believe that discussions like this should always continue. Even for things li<b> ke raci</b>sm and anything that ends with -phobic, people continuing these debates and discussions are necessary to make progress. If not, then we would be the same morally forever. We could argue ab<b> out sex</b>ism and the portrayal of women forever and never be 'perfect', but we would get alot farther than if we just gave up and never talked about it. It kinda sucks but discussions like this encourage progress.\n\nTLDR: We are making progress towards equality because of the continuous discussion, and, even though things will never be perfect, we shouldn continue these discussions to learn more about how we could be better and compromise",

Some people feel that as long as a single fictional female is \"demeaned\" in any way shape or form, there is a serious problem, and I think it's important to consider an end goal for this debate. To use metaphor, you shouldn't offer someone payment without specifying an amount, because they'll always feel their eventual payment wasn't enough. In the same light, we can't just ask that women not be sexualized, without somehow defining how much sexualization is or isn't acceptable.",

All these feminist things like this where even Nerdwriter seemed to bend over backwards to agree that \"oohh men are so misogynistic and women are poor victims who must be protected and given preferential treatment\" is such an american thing. You are way too 'on the outside' over in the US. Way too people-pleasing and fake to each other. Be more honest, man, and move through the mud when people shoot you down with their virtue-signaling dominance.",

They just get to feel righteous about it.\n\nI'm going to try to note that I am not condemning here, because this dominance feature is deep in our DNA, and has always been a part of the human condition.

Also checking on that, if you want to prove something is libelous then the burden of proof is on you to show the harm it's caused, and that it's false) [also are you the type of person who gets really upset when someone criticises their work?] \n\n If you survey wide range of people in general about their experiences, that's always by some measure an anecdote, therefore a lot of people dismiss certain points of view because they've not personally experienced it. \n\nIn an example of this, an abusive person is generally only abusive to their abuse\u00e9, and can be lovely to everyone else. \n\nSo what needs to be disproven by you is that there's A. harm done with the above statement and B. so few men disregard women in STEM subjects that the sentence is empirically false (the sentence did not say all men, but the implications is enough men so that it causes issues within the scientific community, unless you misread it and thought it said \"all men\" )",

I will say that a survey that questions a thousand people is a better source than just one example, but it still isn't empirical evidence.

And if we wouldn't, I'm pretty sure we could find evidence that suggests they do. \"Some scientist wore a shirt I don't like\" is not evidence by the way, especially if you consider the fact that the shirt in question was a gift he got from a female friend.\n\n\"So what needs to be disproven by you is that there's A. harm done with the above statement and B. so few men disregard women in STEM subjects that the sentence is empirically false (the sentence did not say all men, but the implications is enough men so that it causes issues within the scientific community, unless you misread it and thought it said \"all men\" )\"\n\nHahaha nice try, but that is a logical evidence.

Besides that fact, I am a female who has actually lived through the sexist bullshit this study is explaining.\n\nFirst of all, what i gave you is not anecdotal. Please go read the definition of anecdotal. What i gave is empirical evidence (meaning it is based on objective facts, supporting research and peer revision). That means it's a scientific study to examine what is causing the <b> gender </b>gap in STEM.\n\nSecondly, the study used scientific method to further show that the gap is not caused by a biological predisposition in women to not like STEM based studies (as you so crudely finagled in your misguided rebuff). In laymen's terms, no women are not mentally inferior when it comes to math or science. This hypothesis has to be scientifically beaten to death because until now it has largely been the gas-lighten excuse for why there aren't enough women in the field. \n\nThe study goes on to show that there is a direct correlation (a scientific term for a direct relationship between a statistic and a catalyst) between sexist cultural influences in those fields (ranging depending on the country but still existing in all countries) and the #\u00a0of women working in the field.\n\nThirdly, just for shits and giggles, in science, largely inconclusive means not strong enough data to support the hypothesis. This, for scientists, usually means they are ruling out that hypothesis (think darwinism, if a species isn't evolutionarily competitive, it goes extinct). I have an entire family gene pool of scientists and mathematicians at my definitive disposal to don't even try to play the condescension game with me cause I. will. fucking. barry. you.\n\nHonestly, I have no further interest in arguing these well established facts and statistics with butt hurt males who have no idea what the fuck their talking about. So, Kenny, if you decide to grow a pair and discuss this in a respectful mature manner, I'd be happy to continue this conversation.\n\nUntil then, go choke on your own clueless snark. You clearly have no fucking clue how much bullshit an intelligent<b>  woman</b> has to deal with to full-fill her ambitions in this patriarchal world. *mic drop*",

I had originally commented because i genuinely could relate and appreciated what you had to say.\n\nI'm sure we don't see eye to eye on a lot of things. The subject matter of this video might be an example, which we don't need to discuss further, i'm sure my comments have made it clear where i stand on this subject. However, I agree with you on the subject of pleasure out of sanctimonious moralism.\n\nUltimately, whether 2 people agree on a matter is irrelevant. As long as by the end of the conversation each person has learned something the didn't before, the conversation was worth while. The best experience i've ever had was living with an historical libertarian who was passionate about free speech and debating with him on what was the grey area between cultural terrorism and free speech (and, from his perspective, what was the grey area between a anti terrorism government organization and a ministry of truth or censorship state such as that in 1984). We never really came close to seeing eye to eye, although we both emphatically believed in a lot of the same perceived rights. However, we both ended the lease with insights we had gained by being introduced to information from another perspective.\n\nI sort of wish i could private message you this as i know trolls are going to try and hi-jack what i'm asking YOU specifically. If you know a way to pm me, please do so. I don't usually comment in youtube.",

For now he calls the press the 'lying press' but he hasn't taken any measures to censor the press. Now if that starts happening than yes, Trump may be heading at least a fascist government (although not all governments that censor the media are fascist). I recently read an interesting article about how Jefferson hated the media as soon as he was president:\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/17/trumps-war-with-the-media-isnt-new-thomas-jefferson-railed-about-newspaper-lies-too/?utm_term=.62fc5d867a7c\n\nI'll read your articles soon but I find it very hard to believe that the American government doesn't have enough checks and balances that one election can magically be turned into a fascist regime. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong but if I'm not and in four years there will be another US presidential election along the same democratic principles as before and the American people have a chance to change their government, this whole business of calling people fascist will have lost a lot of its meaning. Calling someone a fascist will make the average person think \"oh here we go again\" instead of \"this (wo)man is dangerous\".\n\nThe same goes (with far less severe consequences) for the scientist in the video that was being called a sexist because of a shirt with bad taste.",

                    "commentText": "Reply to OP:\nThe things he does (like killing methane regulations) are concerning. But whether or not Trump's a 'facist' doesn't seem to get anywhere. He definitely has fascist tendencies, and the fact that he has a lot of ties to <b> old </b>white supremacist and the crime world in the New York & New Jersey area are deeply concerning. But it seems that to have a shot at the presidency, or any public office these days, you have to be an organized criminal. There was an investigative journalists who tailed Trump for 30 years and wrote about all of it once Trump announced his candidacy, i can't remember the name of it off the top of my head but if your interested i can find it for you.\n\n [LINK] \n\nThis is one of my favorite journalists, he's spent his whole career talking about mass incarceration and on the ground writing about proxy-wars (look up his bio). Here's one of his most recent articles, to quote:\n\n\"This problem is not going to be solved in the 2018 elections,' warned Akuno, the author of the organizing handbook 'Let Your Motto Be Resistance' and the former executive director of the New Orleans-based People's Hurricane Relief Fund. 'That hope is an illusion. The democratic apparatus will be completely gutted by then. We have to look beyond Drumpf. We have to look at the consolidation on the state level of these reactionary forces. They are near the threshold of being able to call for a constitutional convention because of the number of governorships and state legislatures where they hold both chambers. They can totally reorder the Constitution, if they even continue to abide by it, which they may not. We are facing a serious crisis. I don't think people grasp the depth of this because they are focused on the president and not the broader strategy of these reactionary forces.'\n\nI think a lot of Americans are scared of Trump as opposed to Bush or Obama (even though the policy really hasn't fundamentally changed) because Trump has no spin on what he does. Bush catered to a neo-conservative narrative, Obama catered to the neo-liberal narrative. If taking that veneer off what has been happening for decades finally terrifies Americans into doing something real about their authoritarian government, maybe it will not have been a complete loss. I also think it's interesting to see an isolationist hold the executive branch hostage while the CIA is trying to get it's next war (Iran) revved up.\n\nAnd your right (to get sidetracked), publicly scrutinizing one scientist who might have grown up with some questionable views on women doesn't solve a lot. But maybe getting more men to empathize with trauma women face will reconnect victim with perpetrator. I'm sure in the time since this all happened, a lot of discussion between different people has forced a lot of men to confront this issue. An amazing friend of mine, whose trans<b>  gender</b>, told me after her surgery she had this huge reality change. She went from being a man in society to <b> a woma</b>n in society. The change revealed to her all sorts of every day gendered prejudices that she had never noticed when she was a guy. \n\nI guess the point i'm trying to make is; if your a male, your not going to get the whole perspective. That frustration of being called out for something you thought was harmless (and, lets be serious, we ALL face that moment at some point) is an opportunity to express kindness through empathy for someone else's struggles. Ultimately, if we want to survive as a species, this is something we are all going to have to get better at.",

An other-minded person, the type who feeds off Facebook and always thinks about how he appears to others will jump on a moral bandwagon and agree that the shirt is repulsive and offensive to women while an ego-minded like the guy wearing the shirt will do so because they have an attitude and to communicate a sense of how they view themselves or to have a striking personality. Could be <b> sexism </b>too, but excuse me... was anyone killed here? Was this really a crime against humanity?\n\nAlso, half of those gender-studies are fraudulent, I've heard. There are first-hand accounts of women partaking college degrees in feminist-related sociology studies, science-history etc. that have said there's a toxic bias from the people running those organizations to shove viewpoints and agendas under the rug to promote feminist ideals.

In fact, if anything puts women off science, it's probably the fact that a person can be publicly humiliated for what they wear.",

But the examples you gave aren't really accurate to represent the huge disparities between western feminists's so called \"oppression\" and middle eastern women's oppression. I'd rather say that feminists complain about a flu whereas other women suffer from cancer.\nFurthermore the difficult conditions of women in other parts of the globe are still worth pointing out because 3rd wave feminism does very little for them. They proclaim that women are all sisters, \"women together strong\" but they are not doing much for women in the middle East or in Africa even though they are the ones who need more help and way more people in the west would take feminists seriously if they did.\nBTW 3rd wave feminists are often using arguments to accuse men that have been debunked a thousand times like the wage gap.  It's important to often compare yourself to others to relativize on your problems and realize that, sure there are bad things happening in your life but you are also blessed somehow; mainstream feminism always makes their lives sound more difficult than anybody else's  because they never put themselves into someone's shoes, especially men. Many people are pissed at feminists because they seem to be constantly blaming everything on men, even when they are responsible for what is happening to them  and they are never thankful. They sound more like spoiled little brats asking for more entitlement.That's why they are less and less taken seriously.\n\nBut please explain to me how the European culture disrespect women.",

Why is there such an enormous emphasis on beauty that women who do something as simple as not shave their legs are publicly shamed or \"making a political statment\". Your just repeating yourself in that we can't complain because other people had it worse. Should we not fight against abuse in law enforcement because it's much worse in China?

All the problem you are talking about are the results of women choices.\nThere are less women than men in the Senate or the Congress but <b> nothing </b>is preventing them from enter the Senate or the Congress. Are there any laws prohibiting women to make up 50% of the Senate. Are there any studies that showed that women SAY they are not interested in politics because a man told them not to do so? It is the same with STEM fields. Go and ask women why they don't want to go into this fields. I doubt that there is any pole that shows that most of teenage girls say \"STEM fields aren't women friendly, that's why I am not going there\".If your motivation to become a engineer is destroyed by the guy in that stupid shirt, then I don't think you would have been able to succeed it that field.\n Maybe girls just don't WANT to work in these fields! \n\nI usually consider this issues by picturing a<b>  race</b>. What matters to me, and what is in my opinion the real equality, is that everyone starts at the same point or/and have the same distance to run. People are different, some are naturally faster than others, so they will finish th<b> e rac</b>e earlier. When your only concern is that there is an equal number of men and women in each position, you are ignorant these differences. It's like saying that you don't care whether some are faster than others, or they didn't have the same distance to run, you only want them to arrive at the same time. Equality of opportunity is more important than the equality of outcome. We should make sure that girls have the same rights to education and employment than boys, if they choose different paths than boys it doesn't matter, as long as it is their CHOICE.\nThere've been many policies to force \"equality\" in the west and they are doing more bad than good. If you give someone a job just because of the identity and not there qualification, you might take an unqualified women and let more qualified men unemployed. Not only does it hurt your business but it also hurt the women who actually deserve their place because it will minimize their accomplishment. Take firefighters for example. Their job is very physical and the test is the same for both men and women but because men are naturally stronger than women (even though feminists pretend the contrary) it is easier for a man to get hired, therefore there are more male firefighters than female. But these women pushed the boundaries of what a women is able to do and became as strong as men, that's awesome!! Sure the training was more difficult for them, but the success is legitimate! If the requirements to be a firefighters are lower for female just to hire more of them, it will not only put people's lives at risk, it will also be condescending towards us because it's basically saying \"ladies, you are too weak to become as strong as men so we will make the job easier for you\". We don't need special treatment.\nPlus there <b> is nothi</b>ng wrong in not being able to perform as well as a man. Women perform better than men in some cases and in other cases they are better than us. What is this obsession with doing exactly what a man does? As long as everyone is doing what they like, who cares that we are not equally represented in every fields? If women are happy even if they don't work at the Senate are you going to fire some males senators and  OBLIGE women to leave their job to replace them?? That's my number one issue with feminists, they pretend they want to set women free (even if we already are) but then pretend that they know ourselves better than we do. They know what job we SHOULD be doing , how many kids we SHOULD have, if we are really free, let us make our own choices!\n\nAs far as beauty is concern, it's women themselves who decided that it matters a lot. The cosmetic industry is run by women. Women are the ones telling other women what to wear, what is the perfect hair length, eye color, boobs size...because we love comparing ourselves and creating/following trends. Have you ever wonder why men have less clothes choices than women? Because they just don't care about it as much as we do! There was a time when everyone shaved their legs or other body parts, it's a roman costume actually. But at some point men stopped doing it but women decided to keep shaving. Sure nowadays there are some men who are uncomfortable with women not shaving but it's because they are not use to it. BTW it's often seen as a political statement because it was used by feminists as a political statement.\nAnd again if a women worth is based on her attractiveness is because women themselves made it that way, if there are people shaming a girl for her appearance it is usually other girls.\n\nAgain, I am not saying that we shouldn't complain about our problem because some people have it worse. I am just saying that it is good to relativize instead of constantly pitying ourselves. That's what I usually do because I am naturally optimistic. Plus if you are constantly complaining without acknowledge how much you are blessed sometimes (which is what feminists do) you are just going to piss everyone off. You will sound like a spoi<b> led b</b>rat. \n\nPS: Sure there are more men than women doing high paying jobs but why don't you complain about the fact that men are the only one picking up the garbage or coal mining?",

I think you really went all over the place while only scratching the surfaces of complex sociological dynamics. \n\n- To get into the idea that women are simply disinterested in politics because it's boring is incredibly shallow minded and would take too long to dissect tbh so I'm just gonna let you go on believing that only 20% of women honestly care enough about politics to pursue it. AND that those few coincidentally get elected into lower tier positions or ones that primarily focus on child welfare, national healthcare, and environmental rights. I'm sure that has <b> nothing </b>to do with bias of a women's role in society.  \n\n- Second I'm not quite sure why you brought physical jobs such as firefighting into this? I think you assumed I was under the impression that ALL jobs have to have equal hiring rates, which I strongly disagree with, especially with intensely physical jobs such as firefighting. But striving for equality in an office job and in firefighting are 2 separate things. \n\n-The fact that your saying \"If you give someone a job just because of the identity and not there qualification, you might take an unqualified women and let more qualified men unemployed.\" already shows you believe women being less qualified than men is the reason that women get less employed. THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF<b>  SEXISM</b>. Women being the obvious minority in political jobs for example is what's worrying because it's THOSE societal barriers that restrict women's involvement in integral decision-making processes. \n\n- Also men run the majority of cosmetic industries seeing as how they take up both the C.E.O and the vast majority of board seats in several companies including: CoverGirl,  Est\u00e9e Lauder, Revelon, Neutrogena, L'Oreal, and MAC Cosmetics. Although to be fair, men run those companies not because they're more interested in beauty produces, but because there are so few women in executive positions. \n\n-As I said before it's pretty obvious that a women's worth is most often placed on how sexually attractive they are, thus the emphasis on looks placed on us today that are constantly enforced by media and commercialism, run by men. Not by the gossipy girls in high-school. \n\nListen I'm not saying we can't do anything and that we're all jus<b> t se</b>x slaves with no rights and no free will, I'm just saying we don't HAVE to ignore things we find sexist. If you don't find these things sexist that's fine, Its' okay to voice your opinions, like it's okay for me to voice mine. I think women have made incredible progress in society but this last stretch for equality is that hardest to achieve because people keep trying to say we have it \"good enough\" and should stop complaining.",

It was found that there was a gap in abilities: boy did better in Math/Science and girls did better in Reading/Writing/Social Studies. The Canadian government implement programs to help girls catch up and now girls do as well as boy in math/science, but boys still fall behind girls in Reading/Writing and Social Studies. Why didn't the government also make programs to help boys?",

With that argument you're saying people who are perceived to be superior are automatically experiencing more pleasure than people who arent socially defined as \"masculine\" (the role not the <b> gender </b>necessarily...)And thats definitely not true. No matter what the statistics say. People who are perceived as \"poor\" are sometimes quite happy, and sometimes not, same as rich people...it just all depends on circumstances. I dont think they're experiencing more pleasure, I think its just the status quo. You know \"heavy is the head who wears the crown\" I dont think Henry VIII was happy, I think he just had an assumption and so did everyone around him. That assumption was based on the fact that he was  wearing a crown and was called a \"king\" and people bowed to him and thats just how you do things, no one questions it. i think his ego was being fed because he was winning some kind of game, but I dont know if i'd equate that to pleasure. pleasure is genuine and i dont think you experience it from manipulating or projecting onto someone. and if you do it doesnt last",

Narcissism is not grandiosity but a defense against change [the definition of The Last Psychiatrist]. In this way the ego at once PROJECTS its sense of  INSUFFICIENCY onto the OTHERS, and never has to recognize that this sense of insufficiency comes from within. It is a phantastical handicap; self-defeating for the attainment of the professed aim yet achieving stability for the ego. See Beyond the Pleasure Principle, part IV, paragraphs 5-6. Too long to quote herein. Further questions: 1. Why is your advice for women any different than your advice for budding writers? ( \"Just start\" ). There are infinite reasons to NOT act; your impulse for idle men is to attack them, yet your impulse for idle women is to defend them against a phantastical, projected superego. \"It's reddit's fault.\" Really? 2. Is this double standard in your treatment of idlers not what is actually holding them back? Rather than ENCOURAGE them as you say one must for beginning writers, you are ACCEPTING their excuses as reality. All they have to do is start.",

Why is it presumed that in order to appreciate a purely visual and even titillating image of a human, one has to be dissociative? Is it because this is the way it is or because this is the historical model we're used to? I think it's the latter. Because if the dissociative appraisal of the eroticized image of a human being is symptomatic of a dissociative attitude towards people, then it would be easy to assume that the eroticization is a cause as well as a symptom. But if we're using historical precedent, keep in mind that global cultures traditional place hierarchical provisos on human worth--i.e. humans aren't valuable until you measure their qualities such as status,<b>  gender</b><b> , rac</b>e, religion, clan membership, etc.--so there's all these dissociating attitudes that tailor the behavior, and then the symptom becomes an expression of it.\n\nWe're not used to the idea of an eroticized or iconic representation of a human independent of a message or culturally reinforced intention. We can't imagine the idea that someone can wear an eroticized shirt and see women as equal humans because in order to do so, he couldn't be interested in those kinds of displays (I'm not using Matt Taylor as an example because I don't know him...I'm referring to a hypothetical male). The presumption that sexualization is denigrating seems to be as much of a problem as sexualization being used to denigrate is.\n\nSexuality is (for the most part) an integral PART of the human psyche. It would seem that the issue about sexualization is more to do with conceptual integration failure rather th<b> an sexu</b>al imagery itself.",

Making a big deal about things like the shirt will dissuade young women from taking up STEM. It is one shirt of many shirts scientists have worn in interviews but when you draw attention to it and say the shirt means 'Look science is a boys club' you are reinforcing that message.  It is <b> common </b>knowledge that STEM subjects are male dominated and so you are not raising awareness for that.

When you go ahead and try to criticize someone because of their <b> sexism,</b> and so on, you are placing yourself in a superior position.

Not just a good person, but a wiser and more articulate one. There is pleasure in this as well, the pleasure of elitism. You become a moral law giver, the one who has the power to judge others, and that feels good. When I see people who are not educated, but have simply adopted, for example, feminist ideas, because it is hip to be a feminist, I see someone who will react to anything that can be, even so slightly, interpreted sexist just to get that \"high\". Then, if challenged, he will react  with anger, simply because his power of authority is compromised. I myself am a left wing anarchist, I believe in equality of all human beings, and therefore i despise elitism and cannot support those who use \"political correctness\" just to feel better and superior then others.

I agree. But wealth is a separate issue from happiness. I applaud women who make it to the top on genuine merit, but that is different from the concerning feminist habit of forbidding them (implicitly or explicitly) from settling for traditionally female roles IF that is where each lady's instincts call her, as is the case for many; given that men and women generally form different preferences and priorities for work and life, attempting to establish parity will absolutely result in more people ending up in jobs and lifestyles to which they are not inclined, and therefore, ultimately unhappy. This creeping, sanctioned androgyny seems not unrelated to polls which indicate both male and female working class adults (especially women) to be less happy than in previous eras, despite being more prosperous. Now, you may determine for yourself that ambition is more important than happiness, but that is not for you or any spokeswoman to say for all women, and therefore feminism would seem an affront to individualism the more political it unquestionably becomes. \n...It must also be noted that the increased careerism of women may be considered a sign of social progress, but without women sufficiently giving birth and raising children, there will BE no society to progress. We must never suffer the hubris to forget that our natures evolved to make our species survive, and yet fatherhood is not denigrated nearly as much as motherhood is, for political purposes of all things.\nSecondly, absolutely no one has said that women should be \"barred\" from entering peak positions, least of all myself, and there is no evidence of widespread institutional<b>  sexual</b> discrimination in the U.S. In fact, among millennials more women graduate college than men, and currently they are earning greater income on average.\nLastly, I acknowledge that quote from my source, as all of them, but you keep misusing them to attack positions that I do not even hold. I have been applying generalities this whole time; did you think I was saying \"all\" women are a certain way? I hope not. That said, general intelligence is indeed the same \"on average\" for men and women, but still not identical. How is this? Men tend to inhabit the ends of the \"intelligence\" bell curve -- both the highest and lowest ranges of intelligence -- while women tend to inhabit the middle. For the question of ambition, this scientific fact -- combined with men's larger tendency towards risk, both as it succeeds and as it fails -- would perfectly explain why men are both more likely to end up at the top of the career ladder (CEOs) AND also the bottom (jobless, homeless). In other words, men get both the best and the worst of society, while women tend to stay comfortably or restlessly (as each woman's individuality will dictate) near the center. And yet, feminists seem to be arguing that women should share the TOP with men, but not the BOTTOM as well. No? This tells me that the movement is either missing the big picture, or chooses to ignore it. I would love to give them the benefit of the doubt, as I hope you can give me (after all, like all men, I have a mother).",

It's been over a year since Iwrote it and to give proper citation I'd have to dig up my paper so for now I'll just write what I remember from my findings, Ok?\n\nSo, Psychology is a male dominated scienbce and like most scientists they have a certain assumptions what theywant to prove with their tests etc. so it wasn't uncommon that tests that didn't prove their desired result were simply ignored and only those surveys that did prove the theories were published. Also the surveys themselves often are very biased and the sanalysis is usually going to be in favor of the own assumption.\nI don't say psychology is useless and wrong but it is very very debatable and for every survey you can find or make a counter survey\nFurthermore it is proven that the brain is built mostly during your childhood. So depending on how adults treat you other neural links will beformed, thus it is atleast suspected (here the same is true as above ofcourse! These people will interpret the data according to their assumption) that the different treating od girls vs boys leads to a difference in the brain. What is true though is that in primary school girls often do not believe maths and science to be only for boys but in puberty they suddenly tend to believe they aren't good in maths even when their grades are quiet good. Boys with similar grades will on the other hand claim that they are good in maths because they are boys, which is kinda odd. So basically statistically both genders do just as good in the subjects in school. nonethele3ss girls perveive themselves as worse!\nAlso the way teachers, parents etc treat the two genders in this regard is important. Since many believe boys to have a natural talent they expect them to figure stuff out on their own, while girls will more likely get a more detailed explanation on the assumption she has a harder time to get it.\nI could go on and on, also bout how we only learn about male inventors and scientists in school although it was <b> a woma</b>n who eg invented the first computer, and that there used to be pletny societies were women were equel to men or even regarded as higher! But I think this is enough\n\nthe point is this is hard to prove. Sure there are biological factors, like hormones, sturcture of the brain etc. But Women and men are over 90% similar in their phyisical and genetical properties\" We are more similar that different, and culture can even overrule some genetic properties!!!!

It's the same reason males grow up engaging in riskier behavior, with both outstanding success and outstanding failure as a result.\nIf men were simply most of society's wealthy executives, then their behavior could be the result of unfair social conditioning; but men are both most of society's wealthy executives AND homeless derelicts. Men occupy both ends of the spectrum of success in overwhelming numbers, while women are mostly clustered in the middle. So where exactly is the inequity?",

A recent assessment of 172 studies involving 28,000 children found that boys and girls are given similar amounts of encouragement, warmth, nurturance, restrictiveness, discipline, and clarity of communication. The only substantial difference was that about two-thirds of the boys were discouraged from playing with dolls, especially by their fathers, out of a fear that they would become <b> gay<b> .</b</b>> (Boys who prefer girls' toys often do turn ou<b> t g<b> a</b</b>>y, but forbidding them the toys does not change the outcome.) Nor do differences between boys and girls depend on their observing masculine behavior in their fathers and feminine behavior in their mothers. When Hunter has two mommies, he acts just as much like a boy as if he had a mommy and a daddy.\"",

If you wanna go by Webber's definition then Feminism is concerned on why and how <b> Gender </b>A can make<b>  Gender</b> B conform to wha<b> t Gende</b>r A's determination of the world and it's societal relations.

When you ask yourself whether there are enough women in the stem fields you have to ask yourself is it because they assume they're not capable or that the stem fields are no places<b>  for w</b>oman rather than that they consciously don't want to go down that path. In the case of Affirmative Action you have to look at it through an anthropological perspective, practices and the way that societal life develops through practices in the eyes of the younger generations will determine the world they reproduce for themselves. In other words, although affirmative action won't solve the core problem it will help attenuate the stronghold that defined female roles have on our present culture.",

I for example read a similar paper (I'll look it up if you want) and there the author also talked about some differences in the cognitive processes between men and women BUT he also pointed out that they were minute, especially with regard to modern social and working environments. In other words, while it is true that men and women are not the same, the differences do not in any way justify i.e. the disproportionate presence of women in high-level positions or certain science fields. And they certainly do not justify gendered marketing from early childhood which still are some of the most troublesome phenomena modern genderists (a term I like to use even though \"feminism\" would equally include men) and really everyone else too have to deal with.",

Many people confuse that if you want to be a feminist, women must be conservative with their <b> sexual </b>aura, if you will, to perpetuate the idea of desexualising women. But to talk about equality means to also try to fix the large difference between the sexualisation of women and the sexualisation of men. We also cannot perceive the world's people as equal yet, so to say since each<b>  gender</b> has particular traits. Men generally are more reactive to sight and sound which is why men like porn, if you follow. Women are the opposite, more stimulant to touch and thoughts which explains why most women don't watch porn, because there is porn out there that doesn't degrade women. Knowing this it must mean that the sexualisation of women will be higher. And to fix that inequality would mean to either bring the sexualisation of men up of sexualisation of women down",

I just wanted to state that this video in particular made a lot of assumptions in your arguments presented and the one set of statistics you brought up are not related to each other. Total number of women who graduate college does not tell someone how many of these graduates are in STEM subjects. Furthermore, number of graduates doesn't tell you how many women apply for jobs in their field vs the number of them who are working in their field. This doesn't count the choices people make and assume that there must be some other factor involved that is assumed to be there and oppresses them. \n\nAlso, you indirectly implied that anyone who is angrily defending the offensive shirt guy is only angry because they are in pain due to losing the pleasure of enjoying a status above women. But not every person who defending the guy was a man, so the last point you made seems moot.",

If you are truly standing for equality, shouldn't you been targeting  those jobs too? I would like a feminist to respond.\n\nOn the flip side, there are also fields such as teaching, nursing, and cosmetology that are predominantly female.  Are there practical barriers for males to get into those fields? For me I was just never interested in teaching, nursing, etc.\n\nLastly, what is the inherent value of <b> gender </b>diversity? In other words, assuming that there are no practical barriers to any one<b>  gender</b> and males and females can perform at the same caliber, how do we benefit as a whole from policies artificially populating a field with people on<b> e gende</b>r at the cost of people of the other who performs at the same level/possibly higher?",

He's not wearing the shirt for the pattern, he's wearing it because it is made out of rayon, one of the lightest most comfortable fabrics to have on in a place like Florida, and also one of the cheapest. I live in Virginia, and every summer I buy a whole new spate of rayon shirts with all manner of prints on them, because it gets fucking hot here in the summer and they only cost 12 bucks for a week's worth of shirts. And I don't examine them that much before I buy them, I go based on the base color behind the pattern. A blue one, a green one, a <b> red<b>  </b</b>>one, and so on. I don't even try them on first.\n\nSecondly, he's not exploiting an<b> y woma</b>n by wearing it, because the women on his shirt are fucking cartoons. They never were real people, they never will exist as real people. Those cartoons are a fantasy brought about by the imagination of an artist; an artist that might, in fact, be<b>  a wom</b>an. Women artists draw other women, shocking, I know. Can you fucking believe it? And not all women artists are like Marie Cassatt or Georgia O'Keeffe in their approach to drawing or illustrating women. Hell, Jane from Breaking Bad drew \"Apology Girl\". Are you telling me that wasn't a sexy drawing in any way?\n\nNow, if he had seven copies of the same shirt, and he wore one every day. Then y<b> our sex</b>ism argument has a leg to stand on, because clearly he is sending a message with his shirt. But why on that day? You might ask. I chalk it up to him figuring that it would be a success and he was going to leave work early and hit the bars to celebrate, so he dressed in his bar-going outfit, not figuring ahead of time that someone might interview him on his way out of the door.\n\nAnd also, the idea that his shirt reinforces a \"boy's only club\" mentality is plainly ludicrous. The shirt, by itself <b> does not</b>hing, because, again, the women on his shirt are a fantasy, most women don't look anything like that. You could pick the pattern apart in the same way, but instead complain that the women are all white and call the <b> shirt r</b>acist, or you could complain that because there are no dogs on the shirt, he must also hate dogs. He didn't make the fucking shirt, he's just wearing it, and if he is anything like me, he probably didn't examine it too closely before buying it.\n\nMy wife works in STEM, she has a doctorate in virology. We got married while she was finishing grad school. All of her classmates were women, and all of them washed out, she was the only person who graduated in her class. They didn't wash out of the program beca<b> use of </b>sexism. Some of them quit because grad school wasn't what they expected in terms of workload and pay (writing grant proposals sucks), some quit because of family problems and planned to come back sometime later after they had been resolved, and some quit because they did the math and a masters degree would be a faster route to the job they wanted. Most of my wife's coworkers are women. The statistics you quoted earlier might have been true at some point, but they are not true now. I've been to conferences with her and the male to female ratio is about the same as the general population.\n\nAgain, I can't tell what side of the \"issue\", if you can really call it an issue, you are on, but the shirt is harmless. So is the guy wearing it. Your ire, if you hate the shirt, should really be directed at the factory owners that used children to make it in the first place.",

With SJWs, like Mike, which Nerdwritter inserted as if pulling a pin on a grenade, they tend to speak in a collectivism of goods and evils without considering nuances. Mike, in particular, exudes white-privileged, arrogant speech indicators, disguised as beaming smiles of certitude, that triggers the worst in me. For undergraduate work, i attended a small christian college for small christian minds, that--to my dismay--produced beaming faces of certitude. Perhaps, Mike resembles too closely the certitude of noble Christian soldiers; for me a PTSD episode.",

We don't really know why societies came together the way they did, or why the same moral and value judgments of those societies seem to be in agreement. What we do know is that societies that espouse what we might call 'family values' are more successful at bearing children. Population growth creates economic growth, and those in turn create knowledge, science and the technology we are communicating on. To tamper with that formula has often in the past lead to disaster, such as the social experiments in Soviet Russia, <b> Nazi </b>Germany and Maoist China. The worry I have is we're chopping away at the foundations for a literate, technologically and socially advanced civilization and all we'll have left is the ruined, toxic leftovers of a gender-fluid society that collapsed under its own arrogance and and (oddly) anti-western bias.",

People are so afraid to look inside themselves and see a monster, and see someone who is harming others (whether they mean to or not), and see someone who is afraid of giving up some of their power and realizing that they might only have what they have because they're better and deserve it, but because they were born lucky and into a society that automatically assumes they are more intelligent and hard-working just because they so happen to be male. You hit it on the nose when you said they're afraid to give up their power, so they go on the internet and write angry comments and tell women to die, that they hope they get raped, etc... to assert their power even more.\n\nI was accepted into philosophy masters an PhD programs and I'm one of 2 girls who were accepted into the program I am most strongly considering (I'm also thinking of doing an international relations course, which has many many more females and minorities represented). I'm scared, because I was an undergraduate in philosophy classes and it's so hard to be one of the only females in a class full of males, because even though I did really well in all of my classes and even though I know that I am good at philosophy, whenever I spoke up in class, I would be attacked like no male in my classes--- even when I was putting forth ideas that a male would later say and not be attacked for. I even considered not entering philosophy and doing something else instead just because the <b> sexism </b>is so pervasive. Those little things make a big difference as far as being accepted and welcome into a program. So, yes, a shirt does makes a HUGE difference. Not just shirts, but words on the internet (as can be seen in this comment section which is not even as vile as on a lot of feminists videos), attitudes,  and everything. \n\nI am being sexually harassed at work here in Japan (one of the most sexist developed nations on Earth) and when I told people about it they said \"Oh, it's just a joke,\" but it's not just a joke.

If a person has images of scantily clad women or men on their shirts, then my first assumption is going to be that this is motivated by one's libido, rather than some declaration of superiority.\n\nObviously, we shouldn't think of anyone a<b> s se</b>x objects, but we can't just ignore that most of us find the opposi<b> te s</b>ex (or the s<b> ame </b>sex) to be sexy. I believe sexuality is something to be celebrated, and it feels natural to me for men to enjoy images of naked ladies. That's biology, folks.\n\nI'm not concerned with the focus on female sexuality so much as I'm bewildered that it's <b> less co</b>mmon for men to get the same treatment. Here is where I suspect that are patriarchal society is at fault, but I don't think the solution is to demonize make horniness, but to celebrate female horniness.",

I think its satisfaction, to me its the feeling of relief at not losing, at avoiding that shame.  In my opinion, pleasurable is a word more aptly suited to the feeling of connection, of equality even, dare I say.   It feels wholly more satisfying even than winning, but its a different type of satisfaction.  And its one that is found in nooks and crannies, while the pleasure in the context you're defining <b> sexism </b>to be is found practically everywhere, and it perhaps should be the opposite.  Perhaps what I'm saying is that yes its pleasurable, but its not specific enough.  The word becomes de-contextualized almost the instant its said.  The further describing afterwards is a good thing that you added, I think, but it doesn't change the fact that the word was just decontextualized, and it decontextualized itself, almost.   Or perhaps I'm rambling at nonesense, haha.\n\n\"In danger of losing.\" mic drop ;P",

Having a PhD in Art History does not qualify you for a STEM job. How about giving the stats of STEM-related Graduate Degrees held by women? In fact why not include even undergraduate degrees in your stat since most STEM jobs do not require a Masters or PhD. Also it is stupid to compare the <b> gender </b>makeup of the whole workforce. A huge chunk of the STEM workforce started their careers three decades ago (when there was<b>  sexism</b>) so they bias the sample against women representation. The only honest stat to measur<b> e sexis</b>m in STEMs is by compare the PRESENT hiring practices of STEM companies. Are QUALIFIED men applicants hired disproportionaly more often than QUALIFIED women for comparable position in 2016? But most feminist don't what to find out the answer to my question because they are scared that it will not conform to their world view.",

To me at least, women as depicted in this kind of images are the product of fantasy, just like dragons, mighty knights or gnomes. I would never expect women to look or behave like that in real life, and it's certainly not a feminine ideal of mine. Even more so, as a man, I don't feel empowered by this kind of images, because I consider them to be very far removed from the true nature of REAL people, women or men. Maybe Matt Taylor is as detached from these concepts as I am, and doesn't think that those fantasy characters are derogatory depiction of women in the real world. Just a thought.",

You provided<b>  NOTHING</b> concrete and just invented a bridge to get; He wore that short with sexualized females, and because of this, females are dismissed from serious STEM studies... You provided a light hypothesis, basically that women see sexualized women, see the emphasis on sexuality, feel inferior, than aspire to sexuality, but facts don't even support that.. In fact, there are numerous credible studies that show that females seeing sexualized females makes them feel better about themselves, that they too can be sexy and badass, and that female sexuality is a unique kind of power over the typically high mal<b> e se</b>x drive... and most importantly of all, in my opinion, is that no one should EVER be considered responsible for another person's passions and decisions, because of something as microscopic, in the realm of influences on ones identity, as a fucking shirt they wore, that may or may not have, and very likely does not at all, demotivate or stigmatize a group of people.

The reason why I believe this is that in the most egalitarian societies that we currently have, primarily the nordic countries, women are more likely to choose careers in nursing, teaching, etc., and in places like India that are still very sexist, women have a strong economic incentive to choose STEM fields and are more likely to do so than in Nordic countries. Men and women are not completely the same once you look past their genitals. The same hormones that have massive effects on our bodies have effects on our brains as well. I say this as a highly rational, proficient female scientist. I won the award for the best graduate student in the chemistry department at my university. I knew I wanted to be a scientist since I was 4 years <b> old </b>and watching Bill Nye, yet, I'm willing to admit that a lot of the women that I know are highly gratified by working with individuals rather than ideas. Most likely, when comparing men and women on most factors, they are two bell curves that mostly overlap, but they are not completely identical. All of this is fine as long as we accept that the women who are in STEM fields are just as proficient as their male counterparts. Likewise, male nurses are paid less and promoted less than their female counterparts because we expect women to be caregivers. Sticking our fingers in our ears and screaming \"MEN AND WOMEN ARE IDENTICAL IN EVERY SINGLE WAY EXCEPT FOR SOCIALIZATION\" ignores reality and doesn't fix the problem. We are an animal that is fantastic at heuristics, but we need to retrain ourselves to approach every individual as just that, an individual, rather than as a member of any one group first.",

Science, unlike other fields, extends a warm welcome to who will push it into new and uncharted territory.  Its acceptance of diversity is well noted through out its history.

Instead, it serves as a symbol of what women, even in the science industry, have to face on a daily basis. Even though we've gotten far since the 1960's where women were finally allowed to enter the workforce (both influenced by their service in the war and by the suffragettes who had made this a possibility) the market as we know it today is still male-dominated. As he states in the video above, though many women enter the field of science, few of them actually get a position, and even fewer get cited in news and magazines. And this isn't even taking into consideration how many girls, even today, are sexualized through media.\nImagine if that were a girl, sitting with a shirt with half-naked men on it. The only critique she'd get would be that she's a pervert, and that it (frankly) is immoral to wear that shirt to an interview. This is because men don't face the same thing women do; they aren't used to being objectified, and the mere thought grosses them out, most probably resulting in her not being taken serious as a professional.\n\nAs he states, we are too used to sexualizing women, to the point where we even don't notice it anymore.\nThe shirt is, in my eyes, but a symbol of how unequal the world still is.",

            "commentText": "People are offended by this shirt because it depicts women in a moderately <b> sexual </b>manner. Well, what is it about female sexuality that is so offensive, even to the supposedly liberal and open-minded? This isn't about<b>  misogyny</b>, it's about our collectively rocky relationship with sexuality. If this shirt was covered in scantily clad men, people would think it was funny and goofy. Why? Because in many ways, we continue to perceive male sexuality as funny and goofy. For us, female sexuality still carries darker connotations, something dirty and even taboo. When we see an image depicting female sexuality in connection with a man (Matthew Taylor and his shirt, Calving Klein's new \"I flash in my Calvins\" ad) our minds often automatically jump to thoughts of denigration and exploitation even if that isn't what is necessarily occurring. We think that showing women bein<b> g sexua</b>l is degrading to them, as if women are incapable of being strong, independent individuals a<b> nd sexu</b>al beings at the same time. There is definitely an undercurrent<b>  of sex</b>ism here, but it isn't Matthew Taylor's. It's ours. At the end of the day, WE need to sort out our issues with female sexuality rather than constantly trying to police it in all it's forms.",

            "commentText": "TLDR: I'm right, your wrong, also i gave up half way through spell checking this to study for AP exams\n\nResearch has shown over and  over again women prefer arts, literature , and music, and social sciences (psychology and sociology). Women's often most preferred science is biology. Men tend to prefer math and science as well history. The reason isn't some collective cultural conspiracy that we are all a part of but just don't know it. It is in fact a difference in our very biology which influences all other aspects of ourselves. Men and women have biological differences no sane person could dispute that it is an observable fact, but what is often not observed or recognized is how these biological differences affect our interest and  psychological differences. Why do these biological differences affect i   cannot say and i think it is a question that can be answered but the idea that men and women are influenced, in every society, to have the exact same differences in interest in just an assumption that i find strange for a rational person to make. And it is a rediculace idea that we can destroy all hierarchys in human culture. Heirearchys exists everywhere in everyday life some people have more value that others, usaly depending on the sistuation. A mathmation has less value at a track meet than someone who has trained for the events there, yet both have less value at whietlifting compettion than a professional whetlifter. Someone who has stuided algerba and calculus has more value say when  planing and constructing a birdge than someone who spent their time reading silvia  plath and preforming shakespere. Peopels intrest in these feilds or activies is depenednt on a murade of things but since we are governe by our biology it is resable to assume that our biology affects our intest, and to an extent our study or practince in them, whihc would lead to greater profficeny in them. To take it out of the academic setting , when going to see movie you decied you want to take a freind with you, if the movie is a drama than perahps you will take your freind who is quite and shares intrest in film, rather than your freind who is loud, or don't have money, or you just dont like very much compared to someone else. Its not pleasure to particapte in an heirearchy, it human, and to an exctent animal nature. When you say people get angry over these issues i defitatyl agree with you but your resaonfor why; it takes awy popel's pleasure, i simply cannot. Its becasue when poeple make the claim that there is a socital and cultural consiracy to keep women down, despite what data says it gets poeple angry espsly because men fet much of the blame, not to mention and this is my own opion mind you that this guy right achived somehting great and insted of being celivbarted he is riducled for wareing a shirt taht demeanes women just gets me angry, this guy achived something amazing but instead he isn't great he's misogisnistic. Men are fucking tired of taking the fucking blame for so much shit taht we didn't fucking do its not our fucking fault <b> dumb </b>cunts can't get fuckiing jobs THAT THEY HAVE NO FUCKING INTREST IN GETTING!! AND WHEN WE DO DO SOME SHIT THATS AMAZING LIKE THIS MAN WHO WORE THAT SHIRT HE REIDCULED HE HE WAS A FUCKING WOEMN HE'S BE GIVEN SO MCUH FUICKING PRAISE MEN ARE FUCKING TIRED OF PUTTING UP WITH THIS BULLSHIT.

To me that whole debacle with the shirt felt petty and instigated by a group of ppl who go out of their way to be offended.

I guess its easier to see something as simple a shirt than to comprehend or fathom the complexities of landing on a comet. It makes the more <b> common </b>among us feel equal or superior to this scientist's achievement. Or maybe it could be my own bias for scientific breakthroughs and pioneers who i personally believe aren't credited enough in our current culture of celebrities and instant gratification.",

Would you care to tell me why the engineering department of my university has 18% women. The university isn't keeping them out, in fact they're actively trying to get MORE women in stem and engineering. I'd honestly love more women in stem and engineering. Women earning 60% of graduate degrees but holding 25% of stem jobs is the most obviously cherry picked and skewed statistic as that doesn't mean that they're getting degrees in stem. Also being angry about a shirt is one of the biggest first world problems I've ever heard, like grow up dude american citizens have freedom of expression that isn't dictated by people's feelings.",

And why? Because withholding what was desired is as good as saying you aren't worthy. And \"the boys on the corner\" are all about massing together in their little gang where everyone is forced to pass and asserting their presence, desired or not, on everyone's day.

If it was so difficult for girls to get published because of a bias in the industry then a smart girl would do a study by publishing under a fake name and then rub it in their faces when multiple publishing is accumulated (changing results). That alone will gain them a lot of renown and respect and would turn a bubble theory into a quantifiable fact. (ps science is about proving things)\n\nOr are you assuming that they are stupid? \n\nYou sexist you !\n\nPs the only real sexists/racists are the ones who reckon that certain groups need special help or attention because they are to fragile to make it in the world otherwise...  Believing that someone needs help/protection/lregulations is believing that they are to weak to make it on their own.",

The only thing it threatens is the focus on the actual subject to misdirect people's attention to forced self victimization. This trend of hyper sensibility is going too far as you've pointed out, and your analysis tries to suggest it is only targeted towards women based on the narrative that they are portrayed in a derogatory manner, but consider the same narrative for men: super heroes are always muscular, with pronounced cheek bones and other favored male characteristics, women praise attractive <b> sex </b>symbols like George Clooney, Brad Pitt and so on. Why not consider that as a form of oppression as well? It's because that kind of self pitty gets you nowhere, and that's equal to both men and women, and that is equality.",

Not because of women, but because of, indeed, the mindset that comes with social justice warriors.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nThe small town I study engineering in has two universities (kind of three, but that's besides the point): the regular, highly marxist university and the university of technology. While both schools have their share of similarities, there's also a huge cap in political stance and the general way of doing things. In the \"regular\" (no hidden meanings, I just can't think of a better term) uni, there is a very hostile climate, where the totalitarian and socially controlling and exploiting marxist ideology chokes out all opposing views and opinions, leaving behind an echo chamber, the intellectual void. In my school, on the other hand, the atmosphere is very different, the political background is secondary, and the things that actually matter are your devotion and skill. There is no political strongarming to gain control of anybody, there is just, well, engineering. Math. Physics. Architecture. \n\nWomen have always been just as welcome as men. The \"<b> gender </b>gap\" between men and women is becoming more narrow every year, there is about 60/40 ratio for men to women currently. I don't see how enforcing an incredibly hostile, highly ideologically zealous cult would make things any better for anyone.\n\nPlease, stay in your own \"safe spaces\" and leave us alone!",

We don't disregard one form of oppression because it is less powerful than another, we work towards resolving both because they are equally valid. Creating this idea of \"real prejudice,\" I assume in contrast to \"fake\" or \"lesser\" prejudice, does two interrelated things: It invalidates some forms of prejudice over others, and it creates a divide between the two, and therein ambiguity in where an issue falls leads some to use said ambiguous nature to further invalidate issues which you even may be working to resolve.",

            "commentText": "I know this is an <b> old </b>topic, but as someone who has female family members wanting to pursue a career in the STEM fields, this bothers me. My issue with this type of argument saying that a simple shirt (which was a gift from a female colleague to the man in question) is enough to keep women out of STEM. To me, that's a more damaging idea than the sexaulization of the female body. Why? Because it's implying that women are delicate and don't have their own agency or will power pursue their dream of being in the STEM field. My sister is adamant about being a doctor. A shirt with a bunch of comically sexaulized women isn't going to stop her from her dream. She won't even let her depression and anxiety get in the way of that. So, when I hear people saying \"oh look women won't join the STEM field because of a shirt\", I have to call complete bullshit on that. Not only that but it's offensive to the women and girls already pursuing STEM but to the women already in the field who aren't offended by insignificant things, like a piece of cloth a man wore.",

            "commentText": "The main problem with current feminism, is its devolved into a <b> witch </b>hunt where its more interested than indicting more men with<b>  sexism</b> an<b> d misogyn</b>y who in fact aren't. The actual practice of hating women and discriminating against women or supporting actual observable instances of clear prejudice, is less of a concern to feminist than growing  into the very authoritarian ideology it initially set out to oppose. Far more often than not feminism and most feminist take an approach that it and it alone is qualified to define and determine all human experiences, particularly that of men, and render absolutist judgments. These days the indictments by feminism extend beyond actu<b> al sexi</b>sm as an obvious practice, but instead into shrill indictments against men for assumptions of thought, interpretations of once banal words, and obscure meaningless gestures. Feminism isn't so much interested in equality but rooting out potential or assumed dissidents via the kind of call for over the top punishments for what amounts to Orwellian Thought Crime. \n\nFeminism, similar to Big Brother and the oppressive government of the novel, absolutely tolerates no criticism of its practices. To critique it is virtually an admission of practic<b> ing misog</b>yny and once labeled, then whatever one has to say in critique becomes meaningless as the now misogynist's observation has no value. Feminists, never question the methodology of the statistics they depend upon and most statistics used by feminists are almost always the ones accepted that forwards a prefe<b> rred ge</b>nder narrative that under any honest scrutiny is overly simplistic, particularly when it comes to the lives of men. Feminist don't ask men about our lives, they tell us, and thus places themselves in a rather irrational conviction that they and they alone are more qualified to define and determine the life experiences of men than the actual men who live them. \n\nbecause feminism today sees itself as the exclusive ideology of higher morality and ethics, feminist truly believe that  anything external to its label and submission without question examination or critic to its often hypocritical values, cannot reflect legitimate morality and ethics. Thus feminism embraces a form of hyper elitist absolutism. An example of this is when feminist universally declare that one is a feminist is one believes in equality and social justice and if one is not a feminist then one doesn't believe in equality and social justice. If on insists that one does, then they decide for you that you are a feminist. if you continue to say you're not, then they can only conclude one of two things. Either you're a feminist and don't know it, or you don't really believe in equality and social justice. \n\nModern feminism has become in away a lot like the poose i<b> n th</b>e old movie \"The Oxbow Incident\" All too willing to operate on hyper righteous indignation, its own sense of self manufactured moral superiority and unexamined consideration of its mounting hypocrisies, double standard and fanatical practice of wholesale persecutions to realize that the majority of men they  metaphorically lynch are in fact actually innocent. The recent UVA false rape hoax is a visceral example of the Oxbow mentality currently sustained by feminist practice. Its really a story that can best be summarized by an analogous destroy 100 innocents to get to the one guilty person approach. In the wake of the UVA rape hoax, it did not matter to a single feminist that the men whose lives, reputations and university experiences were forever altered for the wors<b> e by a</b> woman  and a feminist reporter they supported without question. all that mattered to them was maintaining the very methodology of presuming the guilt of men on just an accusation, even in the face of proven false accusations. Feminism version of what accou<b> nts for</b> sexism is anything anywhere at any time past present of future when its convenient for women to use to discredit a man for well, anything. oddly no feminist addresses the sexim women practice against men with impunity. \n\nThere can be no real meaningful discourse with or about feminist or feminism when the entire method employed by feminist is to regard any  form of legitimate counter arg<b> ument as </b>misogyny. Thus in the end, like Stalinism or Germany's National Socialism or any other institution  that eventually develops totalitarian features, like the North Korean government, modern feminism generally exists within an impenetrable opaque dome of extreme self-righteousness, <b> for whic</b>h nothing outside of it has meaning or validation.",

I also do not think that even if I granted that the shirt or incidents like it discourage girls from joining STEM fields that it has a strong or any correlation with your subsequent points on women being published or the stat cited mentioning women getting majority of graduate degrees and still not participating in STEM. That last point about the graduate degrees in particular I find disingenuous since 60% of degrees is not equal to 60% of STEM related degrees. I tried to make this comment brief and I did not address the issue with women being published since I am unsure of that one but I do take exception to the implications of correlation that do not exist between the elements mentioned and the misrepresentation of the statistic you provided. Keep up the good work.",

They don't give a shit and they say, if anything, it was easier for them. \n\nNow you could make the \"oh, but it's the ones that DON'T GO INTO STEM cause they're scared that...\" Lemme stop you there. If China and the Middle East and India, not exactly bastions of <b> gender </b>equality, have such high rates of women in STEM do you really think it's \"ingrained cultural attitudes\" stopping girls going into STEM or maybe the fact we live in the freest societies ever to exist where women truly DO have the choice to do what they want.

Images such as the man's shirt automatically light up area's of a person's brain related to sexuality, cultural condition, or any number of areas depending on one's personal history. We can dissect and analyze what effect such images will have at the conscious level, but the damage has already been done, so to speak. We can't unsee images. And, to a large extent, we can't undo the initial effect images have on us. But what we can do is study the totality of imagery within our culture and attempt to come to an understanding of what effect this imagery is having on us. And then, the next time we encounter a certain type of imagery, we can choice how we interact with it instead of just reacting how we have been socially programmed to react. \n\nTLDR: images fucking matter because we have <b> monkey </b>brains and think stupid shit before we even know that we have thought anything. but, we can do better by understanding how stupid our brains actually are.<b>  sexism</b> is real, wake up people.\n<b> \n-Monke</b>y brained \"person\"",

Why is the notion that the overall majority of women aren't interested in science just dismissed as a sexist idea and social construct? The overall majority of men don't care about fashion. Why don't we as a society feel the need to investigate the ideology behind that. The vast majority of nurses and caregivers in any society are women. Where are the social mobility programs trying to encourage more men into those fields. I'm annoyed by the wage gap argument because that is an argument based on metrics that disregards how society actually works. It disregards that more women choose to exit the workforce for longer periods in order to raise children. It disregards that women don't have to be gainfully employed in order to enter relationships. It disregards that over the course of any relationship, the male tends to be the primary spender. I'm threatened because I'm worried about what happens to men at the end of this social experiment we call \"equality.\" Women aren't as attracted to men the same way men are attracted to women. Without gainful employment, we are disregarded. So we push women into high power positions as a means of equality. They have no time to play a role in a family. Men can't get that well paying job because a <b> woman </b>has it and he's forced to be alone because he can't play his role financially in a relationship. Population decreases. It doesn't make sense.",

That should have been the channel name: poor anthropologist- you snaky clever man, you. I understand the channel's survival is based on the charm of pulling reality's face off in every single video. But it also leaves me skeptical bc just like the popularity of Donald trump's image- it too is crafted and chosen by trump before we receive it. The charm and magic of all these videos has to be known by the creator who uses the editing to exploit on this gear & it becomes unnatural but actually manipulated & pre-crafted- like most sustainable things are. But this is an example of positive manipulation that serves a good beneficial to both parties viewer and creator - I'm just saying he's obviously in on it and assumingly edits around this idea of the mind-blowing Magic",

You're not entitled to safety. This is a universe law, beyond people. At the same time, people need to be protected. That's a humane response. But look at the victorian era. It was very uptight and, I feel, misguided. How can we act? Women are oppressed by sexualization and the lack of sexualization. They are oppressed by this shirt. They are oppressed by the blankness of the Middle East.\nI think that erring on the side of expressive freedom is the better err. It's going to hurt people. The Civil Rights Movement hurt people that would not have been hurt had it not happened, but it was the better way, I feel. So too, I think a person's right to express him or herself is the better side of making a tough decision. Honestly, I think we are all repressed and that society has been dominated by the power holders. And the power holders aren't men. They are at this moment, but if society then puts women in power, there are still people who hold power over others. That is the source of trouble, of pain, of problems. These people causing the real harm are adaptable.\nThat shirt was not offensive. The same way that two men French kissing is not offensive, the same way that anyone's kink is not offensive. People can take offense to it. That is their problem, not he person expressing themselves. The problem comes not from the shirt but from the context of the shirt, which is our world. That guy could be a great guy (he landed something on a comet and he then apologized for wearing this shirt, so, I mean, how bad can he be when he had every right to act like a cocky bastard, but chose not to?). Also, that shirt is cool, it is artistic. It is <b> sexual,</b> and well crafted. \nThe problem is that our world has problems, and this makes people afraid. Women are a power minority. So are non-whites. This is a problem. There are groups of people who hold power over others. This is a problem.\nBut don't solve the problem with exclusion. That's just stupid. You're going to antagonize potential allies. Be inclusive, celebrate everything that has an iota worth of achievement. Do not make the slave the master and the master the slave. That doesn't fix humanity. Do not tell people how to go about their personal decisions. We need to balance our understanding of intent and impact. \nThis shirt is not bad, and it is not a bad thing, and calling this shirt into the spotlight is not worthy of the efforts of people who are trying to fix humanity. What is worthy? A slow progressive, inclusive dialogue that makes gradual but permanent social change that brings about equality and camaraderie and allows for everyone to live and express themselves as they want to.\n\nAnd it's not because \"It is just a shirt.\" Any small thing can have magnificent impact. No, it is because that shirt represents expression. That guy liked it. I like it. I am a man, and if any of you think that devalues my opinion, then you're an idiot. This shirt is ok. The world is not. It is not the shirt's fault. That guy could have worn a plain<b>  black</b> shirt and the world would be just as bad off as before. And that shirt does not represent what is wrong with the world. \nThe fact that we are simultaneously trying to tell people to be one with each other, but also to be sterile. That is the problem with the people who claim to be on the side of progress.",

And then there is a lot people who are feeling there is prejudices happening to men which I am sure is right as well.  \nProbably our world is going through a lot of very major shifts in perception, and it is hurting everyone in various ways, though I hope what ultimately happens is a world where both genders are happy and get along with each other in the environment.",

Usually I get pissed off at feminists, but your voice and music are so soothing.  \n\nAnyway, to answer your question at the end: I am afraid of society becoming unforgiving and hypervigilant about what I say and do, that a one-off comment could send a hate mob of feminazis doxing me, sending letters to my employer and getting me fired.  And I don't mean tweeting something sexist.  I mean saying something that could be interpreted as sexist/racist/homophobic/whatever, and everyone being eager to get angry, but not to give me the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI don't want to worry about my political views getting me fired.  I don't want to whisper or keep my mouth shut.  I'd rather talk with people, with the intention of maybe saying \"Yeah that is a bit sexist\" or \"No, I still think I'm right, but I get where you're coming from.  Anyway, thanks for making that peanut butter & jelly sandwich.  You don't know how happy that made me.\"\n\nI'm afraid of Orwell's 1984 becoming reality.",

From that point, there is no such thing as justice -social or otherwise. \n\nFollowing this logic, justice require freedom, and freedom requires offense.

However, many of the quantifiers for the success of anyone in science require a pretty great level of seniority.\n\nMy worry is that because it takes so long to get into any real level of success in STEM (especially science, where at the very earliest you finish your PhD at 25, have three years of post-doctoral research and aren't leading your own research properly until you're about 30) we are mistaking the fact that it takes a long time to see the effects of promoting women in STEM for a direct effect of<b>  sexism</b>.\n\nGiven that a scientist is unlikely to be producing really impressive, citable work until they are at least 35/40 it probably should be taken into account that the demographics of STEM workers at that level of achievement haven't been effected as much by the great programmes that are now under way and perhaps we need to wait a while to see the full fruition of what has been done.\n\nObviously we aren't done yet and I am definitely all for having more women (and non-binary genders... and more diversity in general) but I'm more in favour of the correct use of data!",

I'm a feminist but it's obvious to me that he should be able to wear that shirt without it being controversial. You should have quickly stated this and moved on to more interesting and good examples of<b>  sexism</b>, and how it can systematically affect what women and men choose to do with their lives.

They're annoyed because they are tired of seeing people complain over matters that seem trivial to them, and then feel that they are being preached how to feel about it.\n\nThe biggest hypocrisy of this video is that it preaches personal responsibility of ones actions in a larger scale but completely feels justified in making an example of publicly shaming a man who did <b> nothing </b>wrong for the sake of an agenda. It doesn't matter if people were not intending to \"crucify\", it's not up to you or anyone else on how you are being perceived. You should know this because that was the point of telling people how the shirt was harmful in the first place.\nIf a simple shirt can make women run away from stem research, then how can it be okay to tell people that what they are doing is wrong for just being themselves? You don't think people who see a guy get heckled for what he's wearing won't have an effect on other peoples choices to the point where we all remain too afraid to offend others? Or is that less important than the equality of a workspace?\n\n Did Taylor need to wear that shirt? No. Should people be adults and know how to deal with the idea that people think and act differently and are occasionally going to piss them off. Yes, at least I strongly think so.\nI myself hate how much ideas like this have to reach so far to turn the smallest of actions into larger than life problems that are holding women back. Ideas like these only serve to make women look weaker and paranoid and men more evasive and frustrated.\n\nThere should be more back and fourth communication with both sides. Instead we have every opinionated asshole getting on their little internet soapbox and putting a magnifying glass on some anonymous people who got an adrenaline rush from calling you a<b>  faggot</b>.",

In high-school many people were confused as to what they needed/wanted to be in their life, all that was important to them was netflix(otherwise media), video games, sports, drugs/alcohol,<b>  sex</b>, sleep, or even just food.(really quite material concepts even if they can be virtually or mentally related) so when it came down to it they went with what their friends said, but every semester of highschool they would get in a different class with influential teachers and they would want to go into a different field. One second they wanted to do computer science, the next second they wanted to be a chemical engineer, the next second art. so where does that vicious cycle end? I for one know that it didnt really end, some still dont know, some arent happy with what little college they have done.\n(Stick with me, i know it seemed unrelated but ill try to connect the dots.)\nReally i said all of that to say this, i dont really think that women dont like science as much as men. However i do feel as though culturally women have been raised to be more social than men, like some kind of female keeping up with the Jones's social game. and that in turn has led them to be connected to our seemingly over-connected media and social systems, a product that our wonderful science and technology has brought us. i guess a question then arises, are we over-connected, or under-prepared for this kind of connection? and then at the same time, assuming that a massive cultural following causes young girls to be social to a flaw, then doesn't that mean that the very studies they aren't getting into is what would drive them further and further away from those studies? and not directly of course but in an indirect but still connected way. its like <b> a monke</b>y finding the wrench that can disassemble its cage and knowing how to do it but then t<b> he monk</b>ey is distracted by <b> the ban</b>ana ornaments built onto the cage.\n\ni hope that wasn't confusing, im no writer. id much rather be a computer scientist, astronaut/space explorer, or even a sociologist.(i am studying to become a computer scientist). but these issues saturate my brain day in and day out. maybe im just connecting points i cant fully understand but ive started to predict peoples actions and things just fall in line. this makes too much sense to me, ive seen it over and over, in my brothers generation, in mine, and even in my parents generation.",

I do think you missed one element that annoys me... do you think the vast majority of Feminists/SJW/less prescriptive identifier are considering the statistics or their unrealized STEM careers or these other higher-order motivations?  Some definitely are, but I would conjecture for the vast majority there are similar cognitive and emotional processes in play on both sides of the argument... one side just happens to be on the right side of history.  What brings me to this conjecture? I don't think it is a coincidence that 'females' (those with the most to gain from feminism) make up most of the pro-feminism argument and 'males' (those with the most to lose, [or so the perception goes]) make up most of the anti-feminism argument.  When personal grievances gain moral righteousness one observes some pretty gross behaviour.",

That's all it is...the only \"pleasure\" is directly connected to male <b> sexual </b>response to images of female sexuality.

I think a much more interesting subject is the broader question of why female sexuality...or maybe\u00a0a still\u00a0broader topic of \"female attractiveness\" is so universally powerful upon human behavior. The bizarre coupling of \"worship\" with ...take your pick from \"need to control\", need to dehumanize, conceal, enslave........so it IS a very complex issue....but the social aspect seems beyond real comprehension without first evaluating the biological evolutionary basis for what shows up in a social context",

            "commentText": "Treating privileges as rights, and their absence or any threat to them as an attack, and meeting that attack with defensiveness or even a counter-attack (or a preemptive strike), that's one of the big problems we face in the world.\n\nMy main problem with the racism/sexism/representation debate is when I spot existing inequalities and see people argue that adding some to the missing side isn't fair because you haven't also added some to the bigger side.  I've seen this crop up in my personal life when we (my family, including my 12-year-old nephew) go to McDonalds or a store, and we have the idea going in that we're going to get <b> ABC </b>(say, a drink for each of us), and I decide that since I don't want a drink as much as I want something else, I'll switch my drink to something of roughly equal value (say, a cheeseburger).\n\nAnd dang if that kid doesn't walk out of there with a drink AND a cheeseburger.  Because I got a cheeseburger, so he should get one too, right?  And my dad prefers to get him the burger than to argue the point (if my dad even notices that the point exists).  This happens even when we have specifically pointed out earlier that we are operating on a limited budget for the day, and go in with the idea that we are only getting drinks because we're saving our money for later in the day -- and then I feel like if I assert equal privileges (getting two cheeseburgers to match his two items), I'll be draining the budget before we've even left the first stop.\n\nThis is kind of what the atmosphere is like for the sexism/racism/etc. debate, in that when some people say \"Hey, we could use some female characters\" or \"Hey, we could use some Asians instead of all these musclebound white guys\" or the like, people on the other side say it's just not fair to focus on stuff like that, in part because it takes away from the existing setup.  Because THEY already have their ice cream, and they don't want to see other people get a scoop of ice cream unless they get a second one.  Etc.\n\nI'm a white girl with no claim to minority status of any type (not even female: we make up half the planet), and I want to play a wider variety of characters from different races and such.  I really don't care about strong, active female characters (I've always gravitated toward Dark Horse male characters even in like Buffy the Vampire Slayer or The Slayers, where they have strong, active females), but I want to play Japanese characters and Korean characters and Kenyan characters and Cajun and Sumi and Argentine and Fijian and Romani and mixed-race.  And I want to play males who don't have musclebound bodies, and females who have flat chests (it would be nice to have some fantasy play there: I have a build like the female<b>  dwarf</b> in World of Warcraft), and to have more choices on Rock Band (which, coincidentally, I just typed Rack Band) than<b>  \"thi</b>n\" and what my friends and I dubbed the \"starved in Africa\" look.  (I'd actually like to play some of the aging country stars, or like Meatloaf, which requires a different body type than all the<b> se skin</b>ny sticks.)\n\nCompared to the people who look around at all the media and see themselves barely represented at all, it's not like I have a lot to complain about.  But it bugs me.  Sameness bugs me.  Variety interests me.  I don't see how there would be enough people in the world for whom the opposite is true, that the entire media has to continue operating from a fear of variety just to stay in business.",

If a <b> woman </b>pursues STEM she can,<b>  nothing</b> is stopping her most certainly not T-shirts. I don't believe women in STEM are treated differently to their male counterparts, women in STEM have actually spoken out and said time and time again that they don't feel discouraged to work there.\n\nThere is no invisible culture barrier stopping them, it's mostly biological and psychological. Why is it so hard to admit that on average women and men have different interests? It does not make one more superior than the other. It doesn't make a female mathematician inferior to a male mathematician, it merely means men are more likely to go into mathematics and be interested by mathematics.\n\nPeople, stop being offended at reality and channeling your anger into people who wear T-shirts that you happen to dislike. Our brains are for the most part (with exceptions) wired differently.",

            "commentText": "THIS video is amazing. I've went from .. how do I put this?... NOT thinking that I was immune to prejudice but at the same time NOT fully understanding the extent to how it applied to me as a white male. What I mean is, as someone who generally tries to stay calm and be a good person. It's just hard to hear \"white privilege\" and not think it's overblown and get defensive about it even when you concede that the idea is probably true. Like anything in life, you need to be able to objectively look at things and read GOOD sources from BOTH sides (very important) for NOT hours but days, weeks, months to start to truly understand it. Even when you're sure you get it it's not until some period of time in that you'll read, or hear a quote or argument that just blows your mind and opens your mind up to new possibilities or, in my case here, simply clarifies the issue even more so. \n\nSo what clarified the issue so much more for me? The quote about \"cultural norms being SO invisible that they seem like insight is AMAZING\". It expresses so much about all of these prejudices in a way that I wish I had heard months if not years ago. \n\nThere is something AS important to me that is not discussed that often, but I know people feel, that I feel is just one reason why these conversations are so hard to have productively. My main problem with stuff like \"white privilege\" REALLY wasn't admitting it was probably true, or to even what extent, but the fact that when I tried to have conversations about (all of these, really) topics like this it very often turns into passionate people with good intentions and motivations SHOUTING at me and others, calling us idiots, not 'woke', telling us to kill ourselves, etc. I've NEVER understood how this furthers the conversation and I get that people are going to be passionate (and that's a good thing) but if you ever try to question these methods you'll be told your an asshole, <b> racist,</b> homophobe, whatever, and that you're just trying to \"tone shame\" them.\n\nThis is ONE thing that I ABSOLUTELY do not agree with because the premise is that you're wanting them to quiet down in an attempt to silence their passion, message, and (usually) that it's a further attempt to assert your dominance.  While I'm sure this happens every once in a while, FOR ME it's not about that. I AGREE with the premise, I AGREE with the passion.  You can ONLY master a few things in your entire life. Like one or two. You can only be GOOD or even DECENT at a few more. There is simply not enough time to spend 10 years on every subject and truly immerse yourself in it. Yet we talk about EVERY TOPIC like we are experts ON BOTH sides. Therefore, what I think is super important to concede is that ALL humans are wrong MOST OF THE TIME and so when you run into someone who is TRYING to have a conversation about topics as difficult as this FROM EITHER SIDE, the best thing you can do is remain calm and get out your passionate thoughts in a way that is as absolutely effective as possible. That is, people, like me, are going to have ideas that AGREE with your message but haven't spent as much time as you and are, therefore, still going to say some stupid ignorant things. Sometimes, to understand the situation better, it's even IMPORTANT to question the worst aspects of these topics specifically to get a different perspective on them. When it feels like you're being yelled at I can't help but feel like it pushes people further away from these conversations and stifles progression. \n\nFINALLY, it is SUPER IMPORTANT to note that the pleasurable feeling that people with prejudice feel by being above others isn't exclusive to them. A lot of people subconsciously seem to ALSO get off on SHAMING OTHERS for prejudice and I fear that this is where the yelling comes from NOT just because they are passionate. Don't get me wrong, I'm NOT saying that SJWs are wrong. I agree with the core ideas they have. I'm just saying that if the point is to ACTUALLY change people, we need to find the best way to talk to EACH PERSON individually. I'm NOT tone shaming because you can't say that it doesn't even always work, I'm trying to say that the passion needs to be tailored in different ways to be the most effective for each person. \n\nIf you solely get off on shaming people ON EITHER SIDE, be it prejudice OR SJW, screw you. You're alienating your movement/cause and stifling the progress instead of helping it. Negative reinforcement doesn't work well as rational thought. It was talking to understanding people who put these issues into new ways of thinking that started to make me start to fully see the extent of these issues and how they affected me... Like I mentioned at the top of this comment about the quote in this video. THAT is what we need more of.",

Scientific inquiry carries far too much pragmatic value to realistically conceive of it ever being seriously threatened, let alone by a couple twitter zombies and tumblrites . I think it's a dishonest tactic to try to shut down critique of science as a social institution by indulging in a paranoid fantasy where anyone speaking a negative word must be silenced lest they ruin science and bring us back to the dark ages. The whole thing has the wreak of something vaguely religious about it: The moralizing tone, the use of big vague concepts like \"Truth\" and \"Light.\" my God man, next you're going to be telling us not to take Einstein's name in vain.\n\nNo, science isn't going anywhere, and it is for that reason that it is not only okay to criticize science, but indeed necessary to.

Feminists actively attempt to stop progressive research not only in neurology, but in other areas of research as well. Feelings and not perpetuating stereotypes is now larger than the truth behind the universe. I can tell you're not within the STEM sciences, because you really do not understand the structure that it is built upon. You can't deny and cherry pick what is true and what is wrong based on your own personal views, if you do, who is to stay what is truth and what is false? It's all deniable, or none of it is.\n\n\n\"it is not only okay to criticize science, but indeed necessary to.\"\nYes, Criticizing is good, but within the sciences, this finds facts and weeds out bad research. But, what science doesn't need is people who have no idea about the research, criticizing it because it doesn't fit in with their agenda. You don't see me walking into your <b> gender </b>studies lecture and telling your professor everything he is teaching is a lie without a speck of proof. That is essentially what this Social Justice movement is doing in science fields.\n\n\n\"then I want some people watching damn closely to make sure that...\"\nWhile, I have<b>  nothing</b> to hide, and no agenda to push, that isn't true for the reverse relationship. Giving someone the power to say what is true and what is not true shouldn't lie in some outside government who can cherry pick what they like and what they don't like. This responsibility lies within the hands of peer review between scientists.\n\n\n\"to make sure that ugly ideas which may have become associated with scientific practice\"\nWhat ugly ideas?

I guess you don't believe that Mussolini or any of the axis powers were that bad since they wore reall<b> y gende</b>r neutral clothes. Who cares about their message or the marks they left on society? What is really valued is that they choose to wear nice suits and nice ties and nice military uniforms.

We're just having a conversation, there's no call to be hostile or discourteous.\n\nI read the article you linked and I fail to see what you find so devastating about it. My major criticism of her would be that she highlight this \"major study from December\" and criticize it for methodological flaws and faulty assumptions without outlining these flaws and assumptions and producing an argument for why they're wrong. Hell, she doesn't even name the study she's referencing, talk about some shitty journalism. \n\nAs far as concerns the meat of Virginia Hughes' argument, namely that she wants to criticize the tendency in neuroscience to jump from brain structures to universal proclivities inherent to the sexes, I am actually quite sympathetic. The brain is massively informed by environmental influences and is an incredibly complicated machine; I would be wary of any claim that tries to make a direct causal connection between a brain structure and some universal human proclivity, let alone a study such as this which does have ideological stakes, stakes which very conceivably are coloring the researcher's interpretation of data.\n\nAll that aside however, I still fail to see why you find this article so threatening. I don't see any laws being passed about what kind of research can be done, I see no thought police donning white coats and entering the labs to enforce conformity with the feminist party line. All I see is a small <b> woman </b>with no power besides that of the pen raising a rag about how maybe there are some sexist stereotypes getting unwittingly reproduced and legitimized under the penumbra of good scientific research. My faith in the durability of the scientific method remains unshaken. I mean just look at global warming and the failed attempt by the goddamn Republicans to deny it: almost everyone takes climate change as a fact by now, and if all the moneyed interests and political power that went into resisting that scientific fact failed to do so, then what chance do some online writers have? Your belief that internet feminism presents a legitimate and pressing threat to scientific inquiry is fantastic.\n\n\"Yes, Criticizing is good, but within the sciences, this finds facts and weeds out bad research. But, what science doesn't need is people who have no idea about the research, criticizing it because it doesn't fit in with their agenda. You don't see me walking into your<b>  gender</b> studies lecture and telling your professor everything he is teaching is a lie without a speck of proof.\"\n\nYou kind of are, bro :) The basic tenant of feminist theory is that patriarchical thinking informs our psychology and beliefs to such a profound extent that examples of it can be found surfacing just about everywhere, including in such seemingly removed fields as scientific inquiry. You disagree and are trying to summarily dismiss that theory despite only having a tenuous grasp of the philosophy behind it. I am trying to rebut your position through providing further information and through argument, not just by saying \"lol, you're just a STEMlord who can't understand the TRUTH! Go back to your Chemistry 101 class and don't come back until you've read the completed works of Judith Butler and Simone de Beauvoir.\" \n\nThe ability of laymen to converse over issues in which they aren't specialists yet which nevertheless concern them as public citizens is a cornerstone of democracy. I don't presume to criticize science in its most esoteric reaches--hell, even working scientists can't really criticize science on that level save for in the areas in which they're specialists--but I am still informed enough to give an opinion on how we should receive some bit of research, and I sure as hell can criticize th<b> e sexua</b>l disparity in STEM fields and how it relates to Matt Taylor's poor fashion choice. Drop the bunk arguments to authority, they are distasteful and not very productive.\n\n\"And who is to stay what constitutes as good, and what constitutes as bad? If it hurts some feelings is it bad? If it agrees with the Social Justice agenda is it good. This is where your argument breaks down, because there is no good or bad facts. There is accurate and inaccurate facts, but bringing morality to facts is just something that is objectively impossible. Facts are factual, they exist whether you believe that they are right or wrong. Facts exist outside of human perception.\"\n\nNo, REALITY exists outside of human perception. Facts are linguistic/symbolic constructs made by humans to try to get a grasp on that reality. These constructs, being so intimately tied to the human, are naturally subject to human error. It's only too easy for mistakes in judgement, and yes, even for ideological bias to seep in. The history of science is replete with examples of this: Galileo thought the planets orbited in perfect circles as opposed to ellipses because he was deep into Platonic philosophy which stated that the circle was the most beautiful and perfect of shapes. Newton's calculations of the universe were hamstrung because he refused to confront the fact that the fundamental nature of the  heavens might change over time, and he artificially divided the rainbow into seven colors because the occult bullshit he was into stated that seven was a sacred number. Einstein refused to deal with quantum physics because it introduced the concept of real chance to the functioning of physics, and Einstein was too enraptured by his fantasies of a deterministic universe put in motion by some Spinozist watchmaker God to consider that possibility. There's an entire extinct branch of science called phrenology deeply informed by t<b> he raci</b>st ideas of the 19th century which sought to scientifically legitimize th<b> ose rac</b>ist fantasies of white superiority by referencing the shape of the skull.\n\nYou keep acting like science gives us this undiluted, transparent access to truth and that just isn't the case. Science as a discipline has this almost miraculous power to generate ever more sophisticated models for understanding and manipulating reality, but it never just gives you truth, it never allows you to completely escape the bias of your historical moment. I think it's dishonest and worse, counter-productive, to pretend that it does. The Copernican revolution would never have been possible had the man remained faithful to the simple TRUTH of geocentricism insured by the fine reasoning of Ptolemy and Aristotle and their inclusion in infallible Catholic dogma. On that note and as regards social justice warriors, I don't think it's at all difficult to imagine that the revolution would not have occurred had the 16th century's version of a social justice warrior, Martin Luther, not broken open a political rift in which it was possible to doubt the absolute authority of the church.",

            "commentText": "The thing missing from this comment section is that, time and again, the existence of stereotype threat and self-prescribed <b> gender </b>limitations has been shown again and again in study after study. \nYou cannot deny scientific data that shows that many women have negative perceptions of their ability to achieve in some fields, and not in others.\n\n [LINK] \n\"Findings suggest that men and women do not differ greatly in their online abilities. However, we find that women's self-assessed skill is significantly lower than that of men.\"\n\n [LINK] \n\"When women perform math, unlike men, they risk being judged by the negative stereotype that women have weaker math ability. We call this predicament stereotype threat and hypothesize that the apprehension it causes may disrupt women's math performance. In Study 1 we demonstrated that the pattern observed in the literature that women underperform on difficult (but not easy) math tests was observed among a highly selected sample of men and women. In Study 2 we demonstrated that this difference in performance could be eliminated when we lowered stereotype threat by describing the test as not producing<b>  gender</b> differences. However, when the test was described as producin<b> g gende</b>r differences and stereotype threat was high, women performed substantially worse than equally qualified men did. A third experiment replicated this finding with a less highly selected population and explored the mediation of the effect. The implication that stereotype threat may underl<b> ie gend</b>er differences in advanced math performance, even those that have been attributed to genetically roo<b> ted </b>sex differences, is discussed.\"\n\nAnd these are just two, easy to google examples that are members of a substantive amount of research showing that women have negative perceptions of their abilities in areas, even when their abilities are the same, and therefore end up underselling, underperforming, and underachieving. There are dozens more, but I don't have my binders full of women handy right now.\n\nFor any female scientist on here to say 'well, I don't feel that way at all' is incredulous. Not because they don't know how they feel, but they act as if their anecdote supercedes the evidence.\nThe very fact that so many people think that one or two or even twenty women's testimony to the contrary of this scientifically observable trend points to the fact that many people look to the confirmation of their belief <b> that ge</b>nder discrimination in any capacity is wrong. That CONFIRMATION BIAS has also been shown time and time again.\n\nAs a teacher, I'm sad because I hear too many accounts of female students who were top of the class, bright, and outgoing in Years 1,2,3, and are now quiet, afraid to answer questions, and no longer achieving greatly in Years 7,8,9. This is not an anecdotal attempt to convince you. I just said I hate the anecdote arguments (or rather, non-arguments). It is an emotional appeal to get people to DO THEIR FRIGGIN RESEARCH AND SEE WHAT THE MAJORITY OF SOCIOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, EDUCATIONAL, AND DEVELOPMENTAL STUDIES SAY!\n\nSo, yes, that shirt was not okay. And no, one person saying 'We have a Women in Tech event at my company' does not mean that it is better. We are talking about ingrained, widespread, SCIENTIFICALLY DOCUMENTED!!! trends that permeate the very fabric of how people, in their many identities, move through the world.\n\nI'm not being poetic. I'm reading the research. It's clear.\n\nAnd if one person in the comments links to one study that shows no stereotype threat, I show you the meta-analysis of stereotype threat that says \" For women, subtle threat-activating cues produced the largest effect, followed by blatant and moderately explicit cues: ds = |.24|, |.18|, and |.17|, respectively; explicit threat-removal strategies were more effective in reducing stereotype threat effects than subtle ones: ds = |.14| and |.33|, respectively. \" And wearing a shirt that shows women as violent-loving, exceptionally attractive, bodacious babes, while talking about your team's scientific achievements, seems like a pretty good example of a \"subtle threat-activating cue\".

Some people operate under that assumption that [[women biologically prefer other fields to stem fields]] because they may be misinterpreting invisible social norms as statements about biology. But honestly, everything starts with biology, even social norms. It's not like they're pulled out of <b> thin </b>air or are an accident. Maybe social norms are a result of biology as well, and this feed back loop has caused a reasonably large segmentation between the sexes as far as participation in different fields are concerned.\n\n [LINK] \nThis talks about a study which found that, while the deviation of brains is pretty high in general, there is still a light correlation between certain traits of the brain and the<b>  sex</b> of the person with the brain. Surely, because this correlation is light, it cannot describe the large disparity between wo/men is different fields. I think it's much more likely that these differences are the result of biology, not society.\n\nBut even then, this assumes that the relative lack of female participation in STEM fields is a bad thing, the result of evil misogynistic social norms forcing women out of STEM fields. Rather, this is just how society works; it influences people in ways which hugely affects what they do later in life. You certainly wouldn't be a YouTuber right now if not for certain societal influences, right? And that's not a bad thing.\n\nWelcome to humanity.",

Equality of opportunity is infinitely more important than equality of outcome. This is why statistics mean <b> nothing </b>without knowing and understanding underlying root causes, and therefore it's extremely facile to concoct spurious correlations, even in completely unrelated concepts (which is why pseudoscience remains rather prevalent in the modern<b>  age</b>). Maybe this, maybe that - little more than maybe's. I<b> f se</b>x asymmetry in STEM is primarily due to actual discrimination, then action should be swiftly taken when the actual discrimination takes place. Otherwise and regardless, don't raise females to be so complacent to cultural norms, or demand that subjectively offensive material be prohibited, if for whatever reason you must absolutely demand that there must exist a 1-1 male-female ratio in STEM (or really, any other job/career). Everyone has the right to be offended; however, no one has the right not to be offended.\n\nThis equally applies to males as well. I would be singing the exact same tune if STEM was dominated by females, and wearing shirts with [drawn] scantily-clad, sexualized men was the norm. There is no \"pleasure\" that I could possibly derive from being associated with a dominant subset of humanity (in a given field, career, area, topic, or any other category) - nor is there any good reason for me to focus on subsets of humanity within the context of STEM, which has aims above and beyond the trivial and petty categorizations concocted by flawed, mortal organisms. I am a libertarian and a classical liberal in this sense - individuality is more sacred than authoritarianism. Provided discrimination was not occurring, there <b> is nothi</b>ng wrong with wearing such an article of clothing in an absolute sense.\n\nHence regardless of what the root cause is, Matt Taylor <b> did noth</b>ing wrong (other than perhaps wear something that's inappropriate for the occasion; a lab coat would have been a better choice to appease the [clearly abundantly] shallow public - but certa<b> inly not</b>hing wrong within the conte<b> xt of s</b>exism in the form of workplace discrimination). In the case of #shirtgate, there was no discrimination occurring - only inference that was immediately connected to a conjecture of sy<b> stemic </b>sexism in STEM, and Taylor immediately became the whipping boy of such an inference. The Rosetta event was twisted into a platform mainly utilized by the vocal minority (hopefully) of SJW fanatics, which not only primarily downplayed the scientific achievement (in which both males and females were directly involved), but regressed the original goals of feminism by inducing further divisions in various scientific and social communities. Do not mistake this as an implication that discussion should be suppressed, but rather that such discussions should not require the exploitation of an incident which did no actual harm.",

And <b> nobody </b>is arguing that that exact shirt is the cause of the problem.\n\nRather, the shirt is a symptom of the attitudes that are at the root cause of the problem. The belief that STEM is a manly field, and the lack of women, and the laissez-faire attitudes toward certain behaviors (such as choosing such a shirt to represent one's group instead of something more neutral), are all factors that feed into and reinforce each other.\n\nFinally, a generalized comment about how to discuss complex, touchy issues: Don't say \"this thing that I disagree with must be an ass-pull.\" That's quick and easy, but also cheap, unconvincing, and kind of annoying. It would be better to try and find out what facts, beliefs, assumptions, and trains of reasoning led to someone making a claim or professing a belief.\n\nIf it turns out to be convincing and solid, so that they were probably right, then you get major intellectual-honesty points for following the line of reasoning and accepting it. And if it turns out that they were wrong, then finding how they got to an incorrect conclusion can give you the tools to construct a compelling and effective counter-argument.",

From my research I've found out that the <b> woman </b>on the shirt is the creator of the shirt herself. This brings up my argument. I believe that if one exposes themselves with consent, they, to a degree, should expect objectification to occur. In this case, the scientist isn't even objectifying her. Hes's just wearing her merchandise. He isn't perpetuating the \"boy's club\" mentality at all, in my opinion. He's just wearing a fucking shirt. Everyone is thinking too hard on this \"issue\", if it even is one.",

People are morons sometimes.\n\nI know this probably wont get read and I'm potentially casting my thoughts to the void, but I think its worth saying in the idea of acknowledging +nerdwriter1's general bravery for stepping up in the face of what could have been a hellstorm to smite him where he stood. I love the channel, love what you do nerdwriter, youre a good man. \n\nIn regards to the whole thing-- the swirling murky gross M-word and the sticky people that brings to mind on both sides of that fence, I'll have to say I disagree with the notion that the shirt was ever an issue. not because of the fact that it was or wasnt sexist or freedom of expression or any of that, but just... the environment around this just speaks a lot to be said for what people cared for the man and his life, and the subsequent value they place upon women actually joining STEM careers. \n\nMy girlfriend is in school to become a web systems architect, has been for years now. She adores the field and enjoys the challenge that it provides her. when I first showed this to her asking 'does this intimidate you from going into these fields?' she simply laughed in my face and went back to her sandwich she was eating. I asked her 'Well, do you think it intimidates any of the other girls in your classes?' to which she rolled her eyes and replied 'I wouldnt know, the ones we had dropped out in the first year cause it was too hard' \n\nI want you to bare in mind that my girlfriend is not a straight A student, and that she's failed a few classes and this has been stretching out her degree plan. EVEN with this, she still tries because she feels a certain passion for it. when she speaks to her female friends about this, generally they shake their head and wonder why the hell she would want to ever do something 'so boring' \n\nNow, I realize this all comes down as anecdotal, and that maybe theres something to it all... yea, taking away someones pleasure to expose an ugly truth is a rough sell, but lets sorta pause for a moment here; the sacrificing of this man's proudest moment, his magnum opis in life, for the promotion of something that might or might not just boil down to someones subjective opinion, is his blood worth the uncertainty of such an ideal? what does undermining something else to provide as a platform say about your ideals own validity or strength to be stood alone? Food for thought. \n\nLike I said, at this point I'm skipping stones across the lake for a bit of kinda sorta public personal reflection. the video if <b> nothing </b>else gave me plenty to think about. its nice. \n\nsometimes you just gotta yap out into the aether.",

I'm all for equal pay and women on the front lines but when we sacrifice quality for equality thats a problem. \n\nI'm my opinion, however pointless it my be to express, we need to empower women to look inward at themselves and the same goes for men. knowing who YOU are is what matters. i know strong women who could give a rats ass weather a man calls them a bitch and i know women who that would destroy, and the same goes for some men i know. the problem isn't <b> gender </b>its a problem with self image of everyone. everyone has insecurities and i believe insecurities are the root of the problem, how to deal with them is another topic entirely and depends on religious beliefs and much more.\n\nwe live in a society that thinks not offending someone is the most important issue, but maybe it should be reversed. who cares if that guy over there thinks women are less than men? if he thinks that then his opinion shouldn't matter right? I'm sure people will disagree with this and discredit me somehow so why can't the guy who thinks women are less than men be discredited also?\n\ni think society is focusing on the wrong problem by trying to silence mean people, that will NEVER happen. for example the government outlaws drugs but people still get them, use them, and sell them. so, if the government can't stop drugs, a physical thing that we can handle, what makes us think we can stop an idea. all that we as a society can do is replace the idea, so instead of stopping the hateful language or symbolism lets try to replace it with nice speech. you can't kill an idea but we can try to balance the negative with a positive and in time positive will win out.",

            "commentText": "There is a great documentary called 'The <b> Gender </b>Equality Paradox' on youtube (made in Norway) that outlines that men and women really do make different choices based in large part due to genetic drivers. The studies by Simon Baron-Cohen in particular are brought to the fore in proving that young babies (we are talking days<b>  old</b>) exhibit this difference clearly in the shape, texture and form the toys that grab their attention the longest take. \n\nBoys tend to look at straight edged polygons and three-dimensional mechanical structures such as cars and lego etc - things unrelated to human interaction. While girls tend to remain fixated on dolls, and in particular, faces - things that assimilate human forms.  \n\nSo, in places famed for having made great strides i<b> n gende</b>r equality and breaking down the so-called harmf<b> ul gend</b>er norms, such as Scandinavia, all the government initiatives to create parity in male-dominated arenas have failed to influence the free choices (let's not get into the illusion of choice rabbit hole for now, please) of women who simply do not want to enter STEM or elsewhere. Consequently, and paradoxically, in countries in other parts of the world with less socio-economic liberty and availability of choice, <b> the gen</b>der gap is diminished and mitigated in comparison to, say, Sweden, where those (apparently) pernicious norms persist. \n\nSo, what this tells us is that given more freedom, women go tow<b> ards ge</b>nder normative jobs that involve more socialising or human-to-human interaction. \n\nMatt Taylors shirt can be viewed many MANY different ways. But, really, this is just another case of Feminism doing more harm than good by over prescribing a social malady that doesn't exist. The shir<b> t did no</b>thing. The response did everything to keep women from STEM.",

Please forgive me if this is presumptuous:\n\nHave you ever heard of the concept that \"Every Cause Wants To Be A Cult\"?\n\nSomething I think the social justice community is not aware of is there is little to no correlation or causal connection between the righteousness of a cause and the quality of the community associated with a cause. A good cause is just as likely or nearly as likely to attract a bad community as a bad cause. Therefore, fighting against institutionalized prejudice, exclusion, or oppression may be a good cause, and it may attract good individuals, but it may still attract a bad community.\n\nI learned this concept from this essay:\nhttp://lesswrong.com/lw/lv/every_cause_wants_to_be_a_cult/",

In that moment people should be tweeting about his achievement and related scientific topics, not about sexist interpretations of clothes.",

Yes, you did mention offense and state that the fact that people got offended is enough to prove your point. I disagree. \n\nWhat is offensive? Isn't it true that everything and anything can be offensive? Is it because the offense taken is related to sexuality that this offensiveness is particularly bad? When is something offensive enough to be deemed a valid reason to give up a career? Would an A&F bag justify the same treatment if the webcast came from a nurse gathering of some sort? If a shirt is the tipping point for someone to give up a career in STEM, I would argue that the field never was intriguing enough for the individual in the first place. You may deem this a straw man because you try to analyse this within a huge context. I think the analysis should include a reflection of how you would react if the representation was 50/50 - and would you still think the shirt was that bad? \n\nTo say that the man wasn't crucified but got something \"explained\" to him is blissfully ignorant. Someone writing: \"I think your shirt is offensive, here is why ... \" on twitter is a very rare occasion. It is more like: \"perpetuation ... rape culture ... <b> misogyny </b>... male gaze... # # #\" and I don't think this is fair at all and I think people should be more open to being criticised about this.",

And in the science fields there's even differences in where women tend to want to pursue careers. I'll turn around your assertion about \"annoyance vs uneasiness\" and ask are you just annoyed at people jumping the gun on controversial internet discourse or are you perhaps uneasy at losing hold of something yourself? Some loss of being able to operate within a hierarchy or framework?\n\nHonestly it's your assumption that i'd \"feel in danger of losing something\" in the first place that pisses me off because it didn't start off seeming like there was something to lose in the first place!

Our <b> sexual </b>strategies are very much alike to those of humans thousands of years before. Please don't give into the illusion that we're very much different.

It should be discouraged, so better ways emerge (like the K selection - two parents are way better). What i mean, is that it appeared for a reason, and that's not the feminist narrative where all rape is about power fantasy. Many animals have reproductive cycles that would be called rape nowadays, where the female resists because of the biological imperative. It mutated into a societal filter that is meant to scare and shame most men, it's not a conspiracy but an emergent feature.\n\nAs a side note, i am firmly convinced that we have an advantage trough our neocortex and self awareness to correct the shortcomings of biology. However, we shouldn't fight it and repress sexuality so violently, like using shaming tactics to nuke a guy that just wore a shirt.

Should we start setting government mandated quotas for schools to graduate x amount of female STEM students? certainly not.\n\nThe modern feminist movement has pushed women further and further from STEM careers and made them more likely to pick a field in the humanities than ever before, just so they can turn around and complain about it. It makes <b> zero </b>sense, whatsoever, as there is quite literally<b>  nothing</b> standing in the way of women getting STEM degrees compared to a man of the same socioeconomic status, and in fact, because schools tend to favor female adolescent behavior from the time of K through grade 12, they are generally more likely to go to college, get private scholarships, and be prepared for their courseload after HS.\n\nPeople that are agitated by SJWs don't feel that way because we fear losing some hegemony over women, but because we fear losing tangible things, such as our liberty, or our constitutional rights. There are many voices out there on feminist activist sites that would like to see laws put into place to make that shirt illegal. This is an egregious offence to civil liberty and is blatantly hypocritical, because no one ever addresses the exploitation of male sexuality in media at all. If you took the movie \"Magic Mike,\" and swapped it out for \"Magic Michelle: The Story of a Female Stripper Making it Big,\" SJWs would cr<b> y misogyn</b>y like no tomorrow.",

Why is it that if you even imply a <b> woman </b>could improve herself or just be more than she already is it's a bad thing?\n\nThese are rhetorical questions obviously.

In my country (Australia), research is showing that young males are actually experiencing more body dysmorphia and eating disorders (bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa) than ever before - even higher than females (which is strange because these conditions are typically associated with females). So I don't think you should completely discount males and their need to appease some socially constructed body image. \n\nTo become a physically desirable male is arguably a lot harder than the process for females as well. While women gain more<b>  fatty</b> tissue from eating, typically, it is also easier for a female to be desirable for a female than vice versa. Male reproduction is about maximizing frequency, so standards are lower for males. For females, the aim of the game is quality - so women are aiming for the best they can get, thus higher standards. \n\nTo be a 'hot<b> ' woma</b>n, you generally just have to restrict your eating.

Physical standards, societal standards, personal standards,  it's inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.  I have heard voices on both sides talk about these issues, issues that I find it silly over all because it's not really helping either side.  I personally would like to a world that looks past <b> gender </b>(which is nearly impossible because we are<b>  sexual</b> beings after all) and that's just my own view.  But, the problem is whether or not we, as individuals, feel any worth in today's society.  \n\nWith that being said, I feel there are issues that are over looked and we shouldn't marginalize males or females...period.  But we do.  If you're good looking, chances are you're going to  find it easier to attract the opposit<b> e se</b>x (or sa<b> me s</b>ex if that's your preference), get a job, get paid more, and become more successful in life.  But it also comes with problems as well.\n\nWe live in a society that really does put emphasis on appearances and not so much on substance.  This applies to both males and females.  And I do believe this is a bad direction to take in society.  \n\nFor the men out there, I do have something to say.  Fuck modern standards of masculinity.  Fuck it!  Why try to live up to those  standards?  Just try to be the best human you can be and fuck what others say.  If some one calls yo<b> u a pu</b>ssy, fuck'em.  If someone questions your masculinity, they're probably insecure themselves.  And just remember we're all in this shit hole of a world together and we have to make the best of it.  \n\nAnd for the women out there, the same applies to you.  Fuck the standards of femininity, shrug off the bullshit and join your fellow men and try to build a better tomorrow.  \n\nI am a thirty three <b> year</b> old man who doesn't try to fit any preset idea of what a man is.  I have my own way and I am my own man.  I have feminists friends, I have misogynists friends, and people who fall in between.  If we just respect each other as we respect ourselves, imagine how much easier things would be.  But unfortunately, it seems like everything in modern society is based around a power struggle, even if these ideas started off with the best of intentions.  I mean, look at the right/left paradigm, capitalist/socialist,  theist/atheist, Star Trek/Star Wars.  I find all of this absurd, and this is coming from an absurdist.  \n\nI personally have no problem with someone walking down a street with either a shirt of scantily clad women on it just the same as if it had scantily clad men on it.  I mean, after all I'm not the one wearing the shirt and I think it's <b> kinda </b>tacky.  I personally like shirts with bands on them.  It's a great way to start a conversation with a stranger.  \n\nMen and women view each other sexually because <b> we are </b>sexual beings.  The point really does come down to respect.  Do we really respect each other?  I think that is a question we have to ask not just each other, but ourselves.  \n\nOkay...I'm done ranting for now.  Let the love come at me.  :-)",

Honestly I did expect your stance on this to lean towards the side of SJW and third wave feminism due to your presence on Tumblr. If you REALLY wanted to do a piece on this you should have approached it from both sides equally without your large amount of bias. Also the shirt was made by his FEMALE friend to wear. Also what you failed to report was the emotional toll it took on him after all of this went viral. Feminists claim for equality but more or less came out as a hate group. You're a smart guy and I like your channel a lot but you need to do some more rethinking in this area, there's a bigger picture you're missing.",

Lets talk less about who was and wasn't offended by the shirt, more on who is or isn't going to go into STEM research because of it.\u00a0\u00a0Here's the truth. One people are surprisingly reluctant to accept - some jobs appeal to one <b> gender </b>more than the other, in general.\n\nScience has always been seen as a \"masculine subject\" as it naturally appeals to younger, less artistic boys. On the flip side, Art related jobs appeal more to women. Its a social construct yet not a preventative one. No ones saying \"You can't go into STEM because you're a girl\", it just a job field\u00a0appeals more to boys. Less<b>  woman</b> are naturally interested in it - nor should they be if they don't want to, as some detractors seem to suggest. \"Why shoul<b> d woma</b>n work in\u00a0 the fashion industry? They could work in STEM!\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThink of how boys are more interested in building sites, computing or mechanics, generally speaking ofcourse. Does that mean <b> no wom</b>an is or ever wants to go in those fields? Of course not, but that's not the point. \n\nI work in an industry filled with women.\u00a0Out of\u00a025 staff, I am one of three males. It happens.\n\nWhenever there's this kind of discrepancy, when ever people notice that a male/female ratio is not 50:50 (a ridicules concept) - they look at what to blame. Who's stopping them? Why aren't there more? Look at that shirt, I bet that's at least part of the reason!\n\nNo. That does not string together. Point me to evidence<b>  of wo</b>man being denied jobs or bullied in the field then we'll talk. Point to a guy's bikini shirt and I'm not even going to bother.\n\n...\n\n\"Problem\"\n\n\nAs if women not wanting to do a certain job is a problem.\n\n\n\"Put down that book little Suzy!\u00a0 Stop doing what you want and enjoy!

Teaching people to be as less affected by presented images of what they should be seems more doable and preferable to expecting people to hide their sexuality and restrain media from capitalizing of of it.",

They don't want to fix what they can't, intuition and want, but they believe they can fix the social deterrences women have in STEM fields.

This ignores the one main reason these people are there, the amount of work they put in.  \nSecondly it always appears to be people with degrees in the humanities and social sciences complaining about the under representation of women in STEM. To these people I always ask, why did you not study physics? Interestingly weather male or female the response it near universally \"because I wasn't interested in it\".  Equally if you want to explain the male dominance of physics you also have to explain the female dominance of biology and general practice medicine. Women seem to be designed as to be less likely to take risks and this follows from an elementary interpretation of evolution. The male population is disposable, that is to say if necessary one man could kick-start the human <b> race </b>with a handful of women and that the reverse would not be true.Thus men are more likely to take risks which is a key component of physical science thus more men are physicists and<b>  engineers</b>. Equivalently women are more likely to take up caring roles. Thus women re more likely to be GP's.",

            "commentText": "Just a disclaimer: I'll be paraphrasing.\n\n0:54 - The shirt will discourage girls from joining STEM research because it perpetuates the idea that is a Boy's Club.\n\nHow does someone wearing a shirt discourage people from joining a field of research? The shirt had women that were sexualized, sure, I concede that point. What's a bit hard for me to swallow is how wearing a shirt with cartoon women on it will dissuade young, aspiring, potential female scientists.\n\nI'd also like to point out that the shirt itself makes no mentions of STEM research, nor does it independently associate itself with that field of work. The only association it has with STEM research appears to be that someone reporting big news as far as our progress in space is affiliated with that occupation.\n\nIf we're to assume that this shirt will have any impact on young girls, we'd have to conclude that the girls' thought process goes as follows:\n\n1. There is a shirt with scantily clad women on it.\n2. That shirt is being worn by a scientist.\n3. Those women must be referencing the field of study this scientist is involved with because he is wearing it.\n4. Because this shirt is involved with his field of study, that must mean it is a symbol dissuading us from becoming scientists.\n5. All things considered, I should not become a scientist because, through looking at this shirt with women on it being worn by a scientist, STEM research must obviously be an all boys club that does not encourage women's participation.\n\nConclusion 3 makes little to no sense because we don't know how, or in what way, the shirt is affiliated with STEM research outside of being a scientist's choice in outfit at the time. Some explanation would be appreciated.\n\n2:33 - We're trying to show how wearing a shirt like that might add to a culture of denigration toward women.\n\nThis goes hand-in-hand with what I wrote earlier. You don't seem to provide a method by which this shirt is doing this.\n\n2:46 - Women comprise less than 25% of STEM jobs, and they are far less likely to be published in peer review journals. Maybe this is because women don't like Science as much as men. If you think this, however, the only thing I can tell you is maybe your assumptions follow cultural norms so invisible they seem like insights about <b> gender.</b>\n\nThere is a lot I take issue with here.\n\nYou propose the explanation that it's possible that the statistics are not just a coincidence and instead are the result of invisible cultural norms, but you don't provide any evidence to back up that assertion. What reason do we have to assume that this tendency among women and STEM jobs as well as their frequency in publishing peer review journals is anything but a coincidence? What are these cultural norms you're talking about? How can you demonstrate that they are, in this case, responsible for the statics we've been given?\n\nThe only explanation you provide in the video is, \"Well, maybe you're wrong.\" Well, OK, maybe I am wrong. So, what? You didn't give us anything to consider. No proof,<b>  nothing</b>. Just a suggestion with a lack of citations proving your point. If you provide some kind of proof tha<b> t gende</b>r discrimination/\"cultural norms\" are responsible for these statistics, please provide some evidence.\n\n3:54 - *In issues like this, you need to keep in mind that we're talking about people's pleasure; about taking it away from them.\"\n\nWhat? I'm going to assume that the issue you're referring to is the discourse over the shirt. The actual arguments themselves. From what I've seen so far, there really hasn't been a connection between this shirt a<b> nd sexi</b>sm established so far. Far too often are these sorts of issues brought up with little to no evidence supporting it. This video is a y<b> ear </b>old but it still has issues that keep coming up of little things like this shirt.",

'its different when men do it', thats special pleading. HYPOCRITES!\n\n3) This was a hijacking of a scientific achievement  for all time, by the trendy identity politics of a few, to make it ALL about them. Then they complain that if people are hostile to the intellectual equivilant of squatters house invading, as somehow proving their point that <b> sexism </b>exist. The self-fulfilling prophetic narcissism of these people is disgusting. NARCISSISTS!\n\n4) I don't see feminists campaigning for the rights of men in the female dominated STEM fields of psychology, nursing, and other biomed fields?  Only maths ,engineering and chemistry. Well done on cherry picking your arguments.  HYPOCRITES\n\n5) Rather than bitching there is no women in science,  BECOME A SCIENTIST!",

Please hear me out, as i heard the whole video out and will respond to any comments or questions.\nMaddox, as divisive as he may be, makes some astoundingly good points about the illusion of wage gaps and glass ceilings. Look up his video on it, I tried linking sources but youtube wont let me. He listed them all on his site (google maddox wage gap). In it, he breaks the <b> old </b>\"men make more than women claim\" by first exposing the fact that the statistics are way off (it's closer to 6-7% difference). He then goes on to show that the more reasonable wage gap has a much more simple explanation: women are less likely to negotiate for salaries. Turns out when you tell women all their lives that they are going to make less than men, the feel okay with crappy wages and are less likely to vie for higher positions or pay. \nYou were on to something with the stats about women in the STEM field. The problem is, coddling them like this only perpetuates the myth women are weak and need to be coddled. We cant take you seriously when you get this bent out of shape about a shirt. Women need to nut up. Stand up for yourselves. Demand better pay, and go into the field you want to go into. I believe in you, now believe in yourselves. Show us what you're capable of.\nTLDR; thank you nerd writer for having such an articulate community where people can discuss this kind of stuff meaningfully.",

You're picking him out because he is a face to direct your hate at, because you can't target \"the culture\" because it is in the air you breath, the water you drink, and so fractured into subcultures and interpretations there of that any such criticisms fall on <b> deaf </b>ears, or are attacked by people who misunderstand your words or disagree with them.\n\nHe was a person who could be singled out and dragged through the mud because he was a person, and this is profoundly unjust.  Psychologically people are better equipped to critique people than abstract concepts, which is what you have the issue, not his stupid shirt.  \n\nYou want to talk statistics?  Do you have statistics on the effects of fashion choices on women going into Stem?  No?  Well than what you have is conjecture only.   As a student of physics I can assure that it is a fucking hard field, even in undergrad; you need intelligence, talent, and mountains of determination just to get a BSc, never-mind a PHD and a career in any space agency.  If you think that a cheap shirt is going put a dent in the mountains of<b>  mental</b> force you need to be successful in the sciences, than you are delivering a grave insult to my female peers. \n\nThen there's the question as to why you would assume that cartoons of women in poses which are barely suggestive by modern standards would have any deleterious effect on women at all.  Unprofessional, surely.  Ugly and in poor taste, arguably so.  But careful that you aren't simply trying to justify your disgust, but trying to solve an actual problem.\n \nLets look at an illustrative example;  <b> a woma</b>n who just put on a dance performance hailed by critics as a masterpiece in our time chooses to conduct an interview wearing a dress featuring drawings of shirtless me with rippling physiques.   Would YOU be equally offended by that?  Would you say that her shirt is pushing men away form careers in art? Would you claim that it is her right to wear whatever she damn well pleases?  Would you deride her for having poor fashion sense or forgive her trespasses since she is a eccentric artist?  \n\nI don't know what any of you would do personally, but I do know that many internet commentators would hold her up as a hero of feminism for flipping the script of men objectifying women in this profoundly idiot<b> ic gend</b>er war we're all supposed to be fighting.   And I see that as fucked up; that even the most pro-women elements of our culture have absolutely no problem with representing themselves as the perpetual victim, always downtrodden and in need of support when times are tough, and praise when they assert themselves, where as men are inherently so tough and privileged that they need to be torn down a peg or smacked back in line.  \n\nAm I arguing that women don't on the whole have it worse then men, or that they are underrepresented in STEM?  No.  \nI am arguing that you're psychologically tearing apart a science nerd because he has fashion sense, and putting on airs as if this is justified, and good.  Ad if humiliating one man will end <b> the patriar</b>chy.  As if you don't have your own problem<b> atic ge</b>nder-based biases.  As if your ineffectual attempt at social progress were more important the the scientific progress this  mission has achieved.  I'm disappointed in you.",

If you think about your life as a whole then you would realize that you have probably done something someone could choose to take offence at. That is why when someone does something you find offensive it is good to ask yourself  if they intended to be hurtful and if they did not then don't be horrible to them. Instead use a bit of christian charity and kindly point out the problem in a way that's not going to make them publicly brake down.",

Plus, people define these words differently, and most of us don't sit patiently and reasonably to ask, \"What do you mean by 'sexist'?\" What do you mean, apart from being an awesome Justin Beiber song, is one of the most useful questions to ask in debate and discourse. \n\nPersonally (based on my own definitions and life experience), I don't think that shirt was sexist.<b>  Tacky</b>, yes.

That's perfectly valid, and I might even agree. Great shirt for a night on the town, bad for being recognized for your accomplishments of landing an unmanned craft on a fucking meteorite. \n\nBut letting something like that influence your educational decisions would make me very concerned about your overall self worth and <b> mental </b>stability. It is like a man whining about the vast majority of teachers being portrayed as women making him not want to pursue a career in education. \n\nLikewise, harassing the person in question- especially after you find out that a female friend made the shirt for him and there is an emotional attachment to it- until he breaks down and cries is a thousand times worse than what he did in the first place. It would be like if someone called me<b>  fat</b> and my response was to break their arm. It was completely unreasonable and those involved were scum. This is pretty clear cut, and the fact that you even question it is... problematic. \n\nAs a good rule of thumb, any time someone complains about something being sexist reverse the genders involved. If it still seems sexist to you, it probably is. If it does not, then you are probably the one being sexist<b> . Tack</b>y shirt with half naked members of the opposi<b> te gend</b>er plastered all over it registers only the slightest of discomfort. \n\n1:16 Mike is right. If he was trying to get laid that would have been a terrible choice. As is everyone is coming across like they are picking on that socially awkward guy who speaks Klingon and sticks his fingers in his arm pits before smelling them at work. This isn't highschool. \n\nFor that matter, the shirt didn't phase me. Now if he was being a jackass about it, drawing attention to it, asking<b>  me we</b>ird questions like 'would you like to dress up like one of these girls for me' or constantly singing about how much he loves Pamela Anderson's tits yeah. When that socially awkward guy who speaks Klingon and sticks his fingers in his arm pits before smelling them at work starts staring at you at lunch and licking his lips while winking at you and using his ridiculous moonspeak language to <b> make se</b>xual passes you don't understand to you it is time for him to fucking stop. \n\n2:20 \"misogynistic undertone\" aaaaaaaaaaaaaand pissed off. Fuck you. Just so we are clear, I have tried to be as eloquent as possible else where. So when I finally did directly insult you, it might carry some conveyance of how supremely livid I am. \n\nStop misusing that fucking <b> word. Mis</b>ogyny is the hatred of women. Objectifying women is not the same as hating<b>  them. </b>Sexism against women isn't even the same t<b> hing as m</b>isogyny. You can be blisteringly sexist but actually LOVE women. The white knights of the world can attest that. \n\nAppreciating the female (or male) form is not 'misogynistic', even in undertone you rancid cunt. You festering cock. You take away from the power that word possesses every time you misuse it. You HURT women when you misuse it, because when it comes time to address something that is <b> actually mi</b>sogynist people will be expecting you to be bitching about Kim Ka<b> rdas</b>ian's fat ass,  and dismiss you off hand like the boy who cried wo<b> lf. \n\n</b>AS A WOMAN, AS A FEMINIST.

I am blameless, regardless of how much pornography I have consumed, how many how low cut my outfits are, or whatever else you want to kvetch about next I dunno wearing my hair long promotes worrying stereotypes, why not? You are hurting women. You are restraining what we can do just so other women (and frankly more men than I would ever have thought) don't feel uncomfortable. You are the religious right winger complain<b> ing<b>  </b</b>>about a gay couple kissing on television because it offends your ridiculous sensibilities and then calling it 'hatred of Christians'. The two homosexuals could be Christians themselves, devote and faithful to every tenant not dealing with homosexuality itself, and it wouldn't matter. They sinned, you decided because they did so publicly they must have been doing it SOLELY to offend you, and it makes you a piece of shit. \n\nAnd if all the mean words hurt your feelings? Good. Because this hurts me. I doubt anything I have just said to you in the last few paragraphs can even compare to how you misusing that word makes me feel. \n\n2:24 Could have fooled me. Maybe a few of you just wanted to have a polite dialogue, but deluging him in constant criticism from all angles, criticism that in most cases amounted to 'let me tell you why you hat<b> e women' </b>(see misogyny) until he had an emotional episode is a metaphorical crucifixion.

                    "commentText": "2:38 Yes, what matters are facts. Statistics less so, those can be very \nunreliable, just see the statistics on your average Fox News program. \n\nYes, very few women are <b> engineers.</b> Very few men, to use an example from earlier, are elementary school teachers. So how about instead of automatically assuming either of them WANT to be these things we consider the possibility that... the average man doesn't want to be around screaming children all day, and the average<b>  woman</b> wants a career that might allow her to spend some time around her screaming children every once and a while? \n\nBut no, it is invisible cultural norms getting into my blue collar, manual labor femal<b> e lesbia</b>n brain and telling me that not all women want to join the military for some reason other th<b> an sexi</b>sm. Or maybe not all women want to scissor with me because a very small portion of the population<b>  is<b>  </b</b>>gay. Really most women are secretly bisexual and I just have to sexually harass them until they drop their panties for me. \n\nThe sad thing is, you could be right, at least in some cases. Maybe a very small percentage of women are off put and don't join up because of a bunch of subtle things influencing them in society. I of course mean join up with the marines. Why would<b> n't a </b>woman be just as naturally predisposed to hours of rigorous training, someone screaming in their face, being shipped off overseas to fight, seeing their friends be horrifically killed around them before slowly succumbing to their wounds and dying in a pool of their own blood? \n\nThat one is a little easier to answer than the STEM question, fair enough, but when asked women are more interested in going into fields where they can help people directly. This is why the equally difficult and high paying medical school doesn't see as bad of a gap in genders. This is also why my female cousin, a nurse, immediately quit her job when she had a child. Reering a child shouldn't automaticall<b> y be a</b> woman's obligation, but she did this under protest from her husband because she made more money than he did. She did this against the advice of a lot of us, honestly. She was actively being coerced in the opposite direction by the 'culture' around her, yet... she choose family over work. \n\nCould it be, that some biological functions born from hundreds of thousands, if not hundreds of millions, of years of evolution are at work here? That culture derives from biological and external needs in some cases? Will I be told I have 'internalized misogyny' for suggesting so, even though I personally have never had these urges and they <b> seem s</b>o alien to me? Despite my living in the same culture? Considering that I may well have a very different biological leaning compared to the<b>  avera</b>ge woman, being a six foot two inch testosterone ridden bear dyke? Can I still call myself a dyke? Do I need to be saved from myself by SJWs and intersectional feminists? \n\nSome of them would say no and yes respectively to those last two questions. \n\nBut if for one moment you are right, and this is completely, absolutely, 100% due to external cultural influences... why is it we are using it as a reason to complain about only a fifth of STEM jobs going to women (who compose 60% of graduates) and not that men despite making more money overall are usually more impoverished, compose a massive majority of the homeless, constitute roughly half of domestic abuse victims yet are laughed at when their abuser is female, etc. As a feminist I believe in equality of genders. Sorry, that includes men. Just so you know, I think there are biological reasons that lead to the lopsided statistics where men are disadvantaged too... but why are we focusing on what is clearly a minority of women when there are larger problems facing larger groups of women and men? \n\nThe most important question though? Are you honestly suggesting Taylor was trying to dominate women by wearing that shirt? Passively dominating them though! Are you honestly suggesting indifference perpetuates microaggressions? Isn't that akin to saying \"if you aren't with us, you are against us!\"? Here's the thing... if you push a fence sitter hard enough, you might shove them on the opposing side's lawn. I am seeing a lot of that lately. The harder you pull on this, the more radical the reaction is going to be. Stop fucking yanking on it, try giving it slower, gentler tugs. \n\nTry to stop calling people misogynists when at worse they are being insensitive. \n\nYou do understand why you lose all credibility and sympathy when you make that sort of outlandish claim, right? You understand it isn't because of cultural norms, right? Because I am about as counter-culture as you get. It is why I hate overt political correctness, because it certainly has a massive cultural pull and denying that is truly ignorant. \n\nAnyway, took sixty seconds. I am not annoyed... more absolutely livid. I am threatened. Because I have to wonder, the next time I complimen<b> t anot</b>her woman on her appearance, am I going to be branded a crazed womanizing sexist and harassed until I break down in tears? The next ti<b> me anoth</b>er lesbian I am attracted to flirts with me, will you do it to her? Because even if we are both okay with it, it might make some Social Justice Warrior/Religious Fundamentalist who saw it uncomfortable? ... Because you know better than we do what is good for us?",

Censoring people for saying things you don't like is craven and lowly, and getting her comment hidden is definitely censorship.\n\n\"No one aspires to be a sewage worker or a miner.Man or <b> woman.</b>Physical labor (mining,military) is for men as they are biologically stronger.Who's complaining about that?\"\n\nNo one, and that is sort of the problem. How are men suppose to feel when women demand the good jobs they are dominate in have equal numbers of men and women but never squeak about the (quite literally) shitty jobs?\n\nYou aren't wrong, men ARE bigger and stronger than women on average. But if we are being honest several of these careers are requiring less and less brute force. Garbage trucks have mechanical arms to gather trash, soldiers only really have to worry about carrying their equipment and possibly another soldier and if all their squad mates are also small women that shouldn't be an issue. We already lower the physical requirements for women in basic training... how is a small man who wants to be a Marine, can't pass the male training but could pass the female training suppose to feel about being denied?\n\nThis is the thing that is really peeling my onions about modern feminism. It is like they want women to have all the perks men have had... but none of the draw backs. I always thought it was suppose to be about<b>  gender</b> equality, that means you have to take the good with the bad.\n\n\"STEM fields however aren't.Women, including married women with kids, in the third world countries work in them and they're doing extremely well.\"\n\nI am glad for them. Though I have to ask, what is their home situation like? Who is caring for their children? Relatives? Friends? Daycare centers? The state? If they can balance a demanding job and caring for their children all the more power too them. That is commendable and respect worthy.\n\nNot all women can manage that, and many want a more hands on approach with their child rearing. Fathers who work demanding jobs don't always get to be there for their baby's first words, for their first steps, and I would imagine a mother with a demanding job could be in the same boat. Children will develop stronger bonds with whoever spends the most time around them. For a significant part of my childhood I had a slightly stronger bond with my grandmother than my mother, because my mother was a single mother working all the time and my grandma had me all day. Apparently I called my grandmother 'moma' before I did my mother, and that bothered her a lot. So she got a job under my grandfather in the oil field as a secretary and they allowed me to hang out with her all day in her little office. Not a perfect solution, as sometimes I made it hard for her to do her job. I was a rambunctiou<b> s tombo</b>y who liked action movies and when I went full John Wayne and shot her with my finger and she didn't act out the part (say because she was on the phone) I became a waili<b> ng br</b>at. \"\n\nLikewise I know many fathers who look back on how little time they had to spend with their children due to work and lament it heavily.\n\nIf they are okay with that, that's fine. But these aren't choices to take lightly, and I find it hard to believe it is more due to syste<b> mic sex</b>ism than it is women weighing the pros and cons of the paths they choose. I know of many women who are not okay with it. You and I have apparently seen examples of both, and all the more power to them whatever their choice is.\n\n\"Well in our (sexist) culture they marry girls only to boys who earn more than them.So they could just sit at home and do household work.No one would bat an eye.But they don't.\"\n\nI can't speak for how sexist the culture is in India so I won't. I have heard stories that confirm that.\n\nIt does sound <b> like In</b>dian women are more ambitious though. I think in the west, laziness and complacency is becoming a big problem for both genders.\n\n\"Btw most STEM jobs have 6-8 working hours here.I heard you have similar laws there too.No? Do they work for twelve hours a day there?\"\n\nI can't speak for STEM but I work twelve hour days. I had another job that frequently... 'requested' overtime that had me work more than that. I eventually got sick of it an quit for a job with a more stable schedule because I valued my free time over the money I was making there.\n\nStill, eight hours five days a week is a massive time sink. If both the ma<b> n and </b>woman in a relationship are working eight to four they need someone else to care for their child.\n\n\"Your society need not say that science and technology are not for girls out loud.\"\n\nThis is true, but assuming that is the cause with out stronger evidence than shirts and jokes is a bit presumptuous don't you think?\n\n\"In the 1990s the percentage of American women in those fields was more than it is now.They drop out or transfer to other branches.What could be the reason for that?\"\n\nHow much of a difference is it? I can only find articles saying it stalled.\n\n\"Isn't that evidence enough that subliminally influencing damaging stereotypes or some other reasons like that are preventing them from entering those fields and pushing them away when they do?\"\n\nNo, it isn't. Negative stereotypes about women, homosexuals or people<b>  of my </b>ethnic background have never stopped me. In fact, most of the time it makes me angry and more determined to prove them wrong. Other times I react indifferently because I very rarely care what other people think of me.\n\nBut I am not all women, so it could be effecting those with weaker resolves. But if you are implying that is effecting half the women interested in the field and getting them to drop out or not attempt it in the first place... you must think very lowly of women. Likewise, it hasn't prevented them from entering other fields where there is no doubt just as much harassment or even MORE.\n\nI find it hard to believe that the s<b> hirt </b>or lame joke of some nerdy laureate compares in either severity or frequency to the lewd comments of teenage boys. Women are not stopped from being teachers.\n\nHel<b> l, in m</b>y senior year I was flirting with one of my teachers, albeit she wasn't quick on the uptake and I don't think she realized what I was implying... until I stapled the lyrics of \"Hot For Teacher\" by Van Halen to one of my assignments. She handed it back to me with \"Don't Stand So Close To Me\" by the Police stapl<b> ed to it</b>. Nothing beyond that ever came of it aside from her narrowing her eyes disapprovingly at me when I looked up from it, and I am pretty sure that blows the shirt out of the water.",

He might profess he wants to help or at least fight for some higher ideal but he's really just exploiting a bad situation for personal gain.

I was going to criticize him in the comments section, something I have done before and gotten a response in at least one case him admitting he was wrong. But I stopped because near the end of the video he points out that places like Tumblr, Rational Wiki, and college campuses have made it really clear the sort of feminists that Sargon would agree with (like me, Christina Sommers, Liana K, and so on) typically are adamantly accused of not being 'real feminists'.\n\nAnd it is true, the way modern feminism treats feminists that disagree with them is very... Stalinist to go back to the communism analogy. Any form of Marxism or socialism that didn't adhere to Stalin's core principles, like those espoused by Trotsky, were belligerently removed.\n\nAs to rather or not modern feminists want to wage a class war, some of them very clearly do. They are either a majority, or a deafeningly loud minority.\n\nThey behave in a cult like fashion at the very least. I literally witnessed a feminist I disagreed with, JJTalkz, be harranged for agreeing with an MRA on one point. Likewise, Laci Green (another feminist I disagree with) was given death threats and photographs of her place of residence... for calling Islam a sexist religion that disadvantages women. Mind you, the context was her calling Mormonism the second most sexist, and listing Islam as the only one she could think of that topped it.\n\nSee, there are reasons people don't want to criticize Islam. There are reasons even other Muslims are scared to criticize Islamic fundamentalists. They are afraid of being killed.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to be the case with intersectional feminists. They seem to have decided that Muslims are a disadvantaged group and there fore any criticism of them is inherently bigoted.\n\nI disagree with Sargon on a lot of things, and I am not shy about telling him so... or anyone else for that matter. But there are several things he says, even comes across like a broken record on, that I think need to be paid attention to.\n\nI certainly would be a hypocrite for calling him overly bombastic too. ^_~ Though unlike him I try to reserve my ire for people I think genuinely deserve it.",

Seriously people, knock it the fuck off with the spam flagging on comments you don't like. It is obnoxious at best, and makes you a spineless coward at worse.\n\n\"The dictionary definition of feminism is about building women up to a level equal to men\"\n\nAnd communism is theoretically equal distribution of wealth. Was it equally distributed in most states that assumed the <b> communist </b>model?\n\nNot just picking on the left though, free market capitalism is suppose to have little state interference. How often do people who purport this belief hand out massive, stringless money grants to corporations? How often have they abused government power like imminent domain to benefit one company over another?\n\nI clearly disagree with Sargon here, or else I wouldn't call myself a feminist. But he isn't without a point. Feminism has been hijacked by those misandrists. They aren't misusing the term, they are using it as a shield for their abhorrent, puritanical behavior. Well, not entirely puritanical. Just when it comes to policing men, shaming a<b>  woman</b> for her sexuality will get you hen pecked. It is not a minority, it is definitely a majority. Or maybe it is just a loud minority... but if it is, there are a bunch of apathetic and quiet feminists who really need to start speaking up against it.\n\nInstead, I see quiet support being lended to women like that bitch you linked to, and feminists who are disregarding this behavior or criticizing it being shunned, are being ostracized... how else do you explain the OP, seemingly a level headed fellow, calling a man <b> a misogynis</b>t for wearing a shirt? He is the face of the majority of feminists, I am sorry. Not taking part in the attack or being bombastic about it, but gently nodding his approval and rationalizing why it needs to be done.\n\nI despise it when people are afraid to voice their opinions, or when their opinions are censored. It is why I get so mad when people like you or Sanj get their comments hidden... or when guys like Gregory Allen Elliot get in legal trouble for saying mean things about people like Steph Gutherie online. That is my berserk button.\n\nSocially shaming someone for behavior you don't like until they are silent is more of a grey area. So I tend to go on rather or not I think someone deserves it. Obviously I am not going to agree with everyone, so when I think someone goes too far (again, like with the shirt) I feel it is my duty to counter it hard. If I am not everybit as vocal as they are, they win. That is part of why I got so testy in the original comment.\n\n\"The seventh, I would be lying if I said part of my trouble with him wasn't that his channel drowns you in dozens of hour-long videos upon viewing one.\"\n\nThat is less him and more youtube.

What's mostly getting me reading many of the responses to your original comments is how people seem to have decided that the style of your argument invalidated your claims. \n\nAs a shout out to people (in general), arguing the use of a word -- even if it is only to be somewhat pedantic -- is a vital part of linguistic evolution, and especially so in cases where a word is transitioning definitions. Look at the TECHNICAL definition of feminism and the NEW definition of it for proof. The word started out only referring to advocacy for women's rights, and has now taken on the popular modern definition of advocating for both gender's rights. While <b> misogyny </b>might undergo the same conversion (to a less severe definition) it is still CHANGING, and language being the purest form of democracy to a certain extent the largest body using a given definition will 'define' it. There's<b>  nothing</b> wrong with arguing for th<b> e ol</b>d definition to remain, as it DOES fill a void in the English lexicon that would be empty otherwise. Sure she argued it somewhat crudely, but again, that's STYLE not CONTENT. It's well within a person's rights to say that her particular mode of argument failed on them, but to use that as your sole ammo for arguing her points is not only silly but ineffectual. \n\nAll that said I'mma let y'all finish but Girl Buu is the best commenter in this thread.

But the fact is that<b>  misogyny</b> is - among other things <b> - sexua</b>l objectification of women. Was that shirt objectifying women? Yes. Did he deserve to be dragged through the mud and publicly lynched because of it? Of course not. You define your world(or at least your arguments over this situation) very much on yo<b> ur sexu</b>al orientation, which<b>  is lesb</b>ian and that's fine but this \"problem\", either your hatred for the word or his decision to use that shirt<b>  has not</b>hing to do<b>  with s</b>exual orientation. It's a shirt of poor choice. \n\nThe second problem with your argumentation is that you are using straw-men examples. Of course there are women (and men) who quit their job when they get a child, but these are not representative f<b> or the </b>gender as a whole. That's what both the mysogynysts and the radical feminists are doing, which you seem to have really strong feelings about.\n\nThird problem I find is that you misrepresent Nerdwrighters argument. He didn't call the scientist a mysogynyst, he said the shirt was mysogynystic. And if you don't want to bend your world by definitions that's ok, but then you have to respect the people that actually do. And then you ramble on and judge him even though he has the textbook example. And of course you have to compare him to christian conservatives because they are the ones who would not get angry about a situation but discuss it in a civilized matter. It's not like they are throwing rocks at abortion-clinics. Although you glorify yourselves in slurs like \"bitch\" and trying to come off strong , modern and approachable when you say that you are a bitch it still seems like you're kinda cheapening your own argument when you compare him to the conservatives while you are the one throwing a hissyfit and insult him. Point is that you're the one who ends up as being the Westborough Baptist Church-goer. \n\nFinally, statistics are facts. You again use the same stuff the mysogynysts and the radical feminists are using when you discredit statistics because Fox abuse them. \n\nNow of course you could disregard this message and say \"wow this tool doesn't know what he's talking about\" but then you fall into what was essential about this video. You lose some part that's been so integrated in your body, so much that you want to completely disregard it, you feel like you lose something if you actually agree with my point of view.",

And we can all see how by a forced perspective see that the shirt kind of fall into the category, even though you chose to be condescending. So the problem is how it is used, and that's why I wrote about @Girl Buu\u00a0's relationship to the word. How she has some hatred of it, because she's looking at the shirt and don't see women being neglected, abused or something along those lines and that's fair, we all have our own words that trigger us. By the way Zeke, if you read the whole article on wikipedia instead of just the first parapgraph on top the page you'd understand where I come from.\u00a0\n\nSo the problem is more in the sense of how <b> misogyny </b>is being used. Because \"hatred of women\" translates to a very wide definition. As I mentioned earlier institutional<b>  misogyny</b> is for example in the 1850's people actually wholeheartedly believed that women weren't set to do politics. They didn't hate women, they just didn't know better. But! back to the problem at hand. I of course base this on the presumption that it's how we us<b> e misogyn</b>y. Even though we can go way back and look at how the priests and scholars in the 1600's used the word, which was in the same sense of \"haters\" artists use it nowadays(this is just my own understanding of the writings I've found on the word, but it's really not relevant for my argument). But for the sake of relevancy let's hold it at least in the 20th century. Look at pinup-women from the 30's are those prejudiced against the female body? They are refurbrished from reality and it's almost identical body with another face. They were targeted for specific purposes, and in that matter were condescending for women. It cheapens their own individuals to be categorized as pretty things to look at and not much else, these women werent pictured as scholars but dressed provocative(read sexy). I would argue that this shirt were either pinups or an homage to pinups. And there is t<b> he misogy</b>ny, when you \"cheapen\" not one individual but a whole group of people you get <b> the misog</b>yny. As the Wikipedia article states \"the\u00a0Macquarie Dictionary\u00a0expanded the definition to include not only hatred of women but also \"entrenched prejudices against women\". And as I said earlier, we're all rational people here so I don't feel that I have to explain the prejudices on the shirt.\u00a0\n\nSo the final guestion is then \"where is the line w<b> here se</b>xism sto<b> p and mis</b>ogyny begin?\" and that's a question for greater minds than me to decide.\nIt's quite late so I'll probably come back tomorrow for spelling mistakes but my point is the same.",

Forgetting the likes, it had made a positive impact at least to me. Reading her comments(not the only one where she might have went slightly off the rail) proved and reminded me that there are still true feminists out there.\n      If all you got from it are the insults, I am questioning your reading ability. You completely missed her and this video's points. This video provided both sides of the argument while ended on the note that the criticism he got for the shirt is justifiable, said everyone including professor is <b> misogynist,</b> and claimed that most people who are annoyed with what is going on are not annoyed but threatened(for whatever reason). \n      Buu's counter-argument was that there is no single argument that can be made that would justify the response Taylor got for simply wearing a shirt. She has also argued that the statistics Nerdwriter pulled might not be because of<b>  misogyny</b> o<b> r sexis</b>m. If someone wanted to go into this field, they would not be deterred by something as trivial as the fashion choices of one of his future colleagues.T<b> he sexi</b>sm <b> and misog</b>yny are present even more so in other fields that are even or might be even dominated by women. There probably is a biological and evolutionary reason for the stereotypes and such disbalance in the STEM fields. All of this and more Girl Buu has argued in those comments, but all what you have picked up were the insults towards Nerdwriter. \n        A significant part of his argument was based on this misuse, so distress is justifiable, especially when this channel has a significant youtube base and he is trying to teach people something. Insults and hate did go overboard in my opinion. The reason for it though was not just the misuse of the word, but also the claim that \"none of us are blameless<b> \" in miso</b>gyny that is going on. He basically called everyone a women hating piece of trash. I don't think that all of that was directed towards him though, and I don't think that all of that was only because of the his misuse of the word and that \"none of us are blameless\". It was probably more because of her passion towards this issue and the feeling of deep injustice because of what happened to Dr. Taylor. I think a lot of it was directed towards all this people who went on harassing, attacking, and sending him death threats while disregarding all of his achievements. And all of it was Over. A. Shirt. That being said, it is true that the insults were unnecessary, but there was much more to her comments than that, and the good outweighed the bad.",

Highest values for me are truth, rationalism objectivity. I guess i feel threatened in a sense that if we continue like this then society will devolve into the middle ages and all the strides we have made because of science and logic will be for naught. I'm also tired of women being the protected and coddled class and men getting the shit end of the stick everywhere when in reality we should be equal. It's the feminists who are really perpetuating inequality, often not due to a sense of equality but because of self-interest.\n\nSociety needs to stop treating women like children and women need to start taking responsibility for themselves and their actions. WOMEN DON'T NEED TO BE CODDLED. Because <b> nobody </b>gives two shits about offending men.\n\n\nWomen are less interested in science and tech. I know, I'm a computer engineering student. Even in my field or in engineering in general women gravitate towards the easier wishywashier or more glamorous areas like design and economics. I've yet to meet one<b>  woman</b> engineer who's passions is computer security while at the same time i know many men, including myself. Now you can argue why it is like this and i personally think it'<b> s nobod</b>y else's fault but women's. Education is equal. Actually in most cases women have an advantage with special scholarships and organizations. What separates men from women MORE is that women care more about and are more susceptible to social perception, image and trends. It's pretty obvious everywhere when the majority of really nerdy hobbies and jobs are dominated by men. It's easier for men to say fuck you to social conventions and pursue their dreams and interests. For some reason women are more dependent on society and have a bigger need of being accepted.",

But... what if I told you that it's because women and men are different, not just physiologically, but also psychologically? What if I told you that the above assumption is not based on cultural norms, but biology itself? There are plethoras of studies exposing dramatic differences in male and female cognition. Why are we so against this idea that men and women are different? Why can't we simply accept (and perhaps even celebrate) the fact that men and women are different instead of trying to forcefully androgenize society by assuming that a 50/50 <b> gender </b>split in the global population ought to translate to a 50/50<b>  gender</b> split in every single populace (be it STEM or a different one), and subsequently trying to enforce an eve<b> n gende</b>r split based on the notion that women are psychologically identical to men?",

I mean, isn't classifying someone as part of an oppressive group because of the shirt he wears and disparaging him because of it, asserting oneself in a hierarchy? Of historical oppresors, the do-ggoders, and at the top of the pyramid, the historically oppressed? That's what I think some people have against SJW's. Granted, some people who don't like SJW's are just straight up awful people, sexists, racists, homophobes etc, but I think that some people who are annoyed at them occasionally, myself included, are annoyed because we see in their rhetoric the same system of 'self hierarchy assignment' that hate groups use, the only difference is their order is the reverse of the status quo. They patronizingly hold traditionally oppressed peoples up on a pedestal, below them are the righteous warriors of justice, the enlightened, the humble do-gooders, and at the bottom are the traditionally privileged. Now as I say, I don't hate social justice or most people that espouse it, but at the core of the movement, at the core of most movements actually, is the so-called self-hierarchy assignment that you described, and only attributing this behavior to the pro-shit side of this argument shows a deep lacking of self-awareness.",

            "commentText": "Let me make a counter-proposition, women aren't being driven away from stem by subliminal messages, they are being driven toward something else by positive messages. Here's the thing, we should know by now that negative messages don't drive people away from a subject, if you are bombarded by negative or repellant messages you are only driven closer to what cannot be obtained. This was the driving force behind most civil rights actions in the first place. Because humans are driven toward that which they are told they cannot have, it makes no sense to suggest that women are driven out of stem by negative messages, we must assume they are being driven toward something else. \n\nIf you buy your daughter a barbie, it's not out of the malicious desire to see her conform to femininity, but because it is something you think that she would like. Girls, like boys, figure out what other people think they should like and accept or reject such notions based on their relationship to the suggestive figures. If dad who you love gives you a barbie and is happy and wants to see you happy then you associate barbie with happiness because clearly that's the effect the object is meant to illicit. If parents are guilty of assigning a <b> sex </b>to their daughters through the objects they give them, it's only because generally that's what they are told girls will want. \n\nSo a person determines part of her identity by observing what other people expect them to want and conforming to that notion or rejecting it. Most parents are shown by commercials that their children want ovens, toy babies, and nurse tools because most adult women go into culinary or nursing professions or else identify themselves as mothers. Likewise when women are given these objects and expected to find joy in them they are taught to associate cooking, nursing, and motherhood with joy.\n\nSo if the above far more likely premise is valid then some random scientists shirt isn't harmful, you're just using that baseless supposition to criticize an irrelevant detail because you see malice where there is none. After all, we are not slaves to subliminal messages, as Sarte would suggest we are radically free. If fewer women are in STEM it's not because they're given a message that it's a boys club, it's that they don't pay much attention to it at all because it's not related to what they form emotional attachments to typically.\n\nIf you want more women to go into stem, don't complain about some random scientists harmful shirt, start marketing chemistry sets for girls that are... you know... regular chemistry sets.",

Perhaps the scientist just likes garish shirts with eccentric designs. This one happened to feature scantily clad women. Perhaps it is merely an expression of his outgoing, buffoonish personality, rather than an act of intrinsically satisfying dominance. I can't say - I don't know the man. But neither do you and to argue either way is just speculation and should be noted as such. Also your attempt to somehow equate his behavior with the stats about women not entering stem is at best a reach and at worst somewhat disingenuous. Your dismissal of women who are not bothered by the shirt is also pretty troubling.\n\nI can tell you exactly what I thought about the event of 'shirtgate'. Firstly I was mildly irritated that a great scientific achievement was being overshadowed by one man's (admittedly awful) taste in clothing design. Then I was shocked, horrified and dismayed at the disproportionate response by his critics. A response that, need I remind you, drove the man to break down and cry in public. \n\nI can do the empathy exercise and imagine being a young <b> woman </b>eager to enter a stem field. I guess I would find his choice of shirt extremely irritating and boorish and when combined with all the other media stories about<b>  sexism</b> in x,y,z field it may have a demotivating factor. But I also know that if I was truly passionate about my chosen field I would not let things like this dissuade me from entering it.  And if I still possessed any sort of moral grounding I would not be demonizing the man or trying to force an apology from him.\n\nWas his dress inappropriate for a Public work event? Yes. Was the fact that there were pretty women on his awful shirt an indicator that this man is sexist? No. Poorly attuned to the needs of others, a bit clueless and certainly not likely to win an award for SJW of the year, but not sexist. The vituperative response of his critics revealed far more about them than it did him.",

To illustrate why this is ridiculous: there is a<b>  gender</b> gap for teachers in the US. The majority of US teachers in K-12 schools are female. Does this mean a female teacher shouldn't wear a skirt because by doing so she is implicitly asserting that you need to wear a skirt and be part of the girl's skirt club to be a teacher? It's damn arbitrary to start pulling connections like these out o<b> f thi</b>n air based only upon the existence of discrepancies.",

            "commentText": "Your analysis is even headed, but I don't think you understand why many people are annoyed. As a person that actually works in STEM, there were several things that annoyed me about this situation.\n\nFor starters, it's how the public missed the real story. A person, whose team lead us to the next milestone in space exploration, is telling you all about it and all you care about is a shirt. I won't even bother with thought experiments on changing the roles. Just the fact that everyone is talking about the shirt is just so depressing. For me, this highlights in the most obvious way how backwards our priorities are.\n\nBut the thing that gets to me the most is how counter-productive this discussion has been. We, who work in STEM, care about the lack of women. It affects us daily on a personal level, not just in the abstract way that SJWs try to \"fix\" things. Many of us have invested effort in bringing in more women to our field. Every practical reason not to join has been removed and the only remaining obstacle seems to be that women think there would be something wrong if they joined. It is a matter of perception and this whole story reinforced the problem tenfold. Not the shirt, mind you, but the reaction to the shirt. The shirt may or may not have been noticed by some women, who may or may not have cared. But the message that got heard by everyone was when SJWs started screaming about how unwelcoming the STEM fields are. Now, more women think STEM is bad for them than ever before. So much progress was undone in the name of making things better.",

Whether I, you or he has a problem with it is irrelevant because it might not affect us personally.\n\nYou admitted that the engineer field is looking to be more inviting to women. Fantastic.

The men who attacked the SJWs are the deterrent. The SJWs do not scare me and most do not affect me at all; It's mostly complaints and pointing out of various unfair stuff to certain degrees, most of which I ignore anyway or just accept. The\u00a0 hardcore bashing of women as a reaction to the SJWs, however, is doing the real harm. The violence-talk and aggressive attacks on anyone who brings up feminism or women's issues is downright scary. It makes men look bad and fields dominated by men become terrifying to even consider. I refuse to believe that men are that horrible, but the impression those that attack SJWs in such emotionally triggered manners leads me to believe that male-dominated professions are dangerous to<b>  woman</b>, or at least downright unwelcoming.\n\nPersonally, I wish I went into Biology which was a great interest of mine in school, but I had some bad experiences with male colleague on the university level. I started in the Physics department because I did well in the AP class for it at my high school and the teacher got me into a good university program on scholarship; However, when I got there, I didn't get the support I needed so I switched out to the liberal arts. I regret my decision and wish I attended an all-female school instead. I sincerely hope you are right about the changes you speak of in your earlier comment, because I could not find any mentors, and fellow male students were inappropriate around me (sexually mostly, but also skeptical of my abilities, talked over me a lot and i got excluded from study groups--sigh). It was not easy being alone at a difficult university and feeling isolated. I met lots of great women in Sociology, so that's the path I took. It's not the one I wanted most, but it was a lot friendlier at the time.\n\nBut thank you for caring enough to help mentor and respect the women in STEM. I hope there are more people like you who will believe in the young women that try to break barriers and give them the much-needed support that I never got.",

Unless you can give a reason why a presentation on a STEM subject is so drastically different from other presentations or conferences that it would effect how I would react to the behavior of the speaker, I don't see how WHAT the person was talking about is relevant to my perspective on what's appropriate for a conference. Until you can point out a difference, I'm going to think you're arbitrarily nitpicking ways in which the situation is not perfectly analogous as a way to ignore a contingency of people telling you it IS a problem.\n\nThroughout this thread, there's kind of some circular logic going on by citing women in the STEM fields that were fine with all of this. On the one hand, they are, for the most part, the only demographic this concerns and therefore they are the authority on whether this is a big deal. On the other hand, if the whole point is that this kind of behavior is off-putting and driving women away from your field, doesn't that mean the women you're citing are essentially \"the ones left\"?\n\nI'm interested in sociology and law.

It doesn't give them any authority or power on the community. You don't have to inform your perspective by who's talking. You only have to understand that your opinion will be rightly ignored when it is not relevant. You're not part of the community, therefore you do not get to dictate the rules by which we operate.\n\nBelieve it or not, there are millions of women working in the field and they're all adults. Our HR departments are open for them to voice their concerns, and most of the time the reaction is to their satisfaction. And HR departments are staffed mostly with women, who do care about appearances. If the women in STEM don't care about the things that you do, then we don't care either. Why on earth would we ever care to be attractive to people, who never seriously considered a career in STEM?\n\n\"doesn't that mean the women you're citing are essentially \"the ones left\"?\"\n\nWe're very aware that this can play a part, as we are aware that this cannot be but a small part. We're much more worried about losing women who do fit, but they are lead to believe by people with no personal experience that they will be mistreated. There aren't women leaving at any noticeable rate because they couldn't handle the dresscode. Surely, if your point was good, some would have joined and found things to be worse than they thought. In reality, they all find things to be normal. Not to mention that men can be just as preoccupied with clothes, but men aren't bothered either.\n\nIt is a far more likely explanation that analytical minds, which tend to make good scientists and <b> engineers,</b> are also not inclined to cater to emotions and appearances. Did you know that engineering positions used to have \"normal\" dresscodes, but companies are relaxing them in order to attract better<b>  engineers</b>? I've heard of employers who now explicitly ban formal clothes, so as not to make coworkers uncomfortable. You may think your dresscode is good and ours is bad, but we think the exact opposite.\u00a0It turns out that not every personality type is attracted to every field of work. We're not trying to impose our style onto your fields, so why are you pushing yours on us?",

That doesn't mean you couldn't possibly gain anything from listening to me. We are BOTH outside of the sweet spot on the Venn Diagram of who this concerns. I could just as easily flip this around and say \"Well you're not a <b> woman,</b> so shut up, u dont no\" but I'm not. Because how the scientific community operates is something I have no experience with, and therefore I should listen when someone speaks about their experience, even though yours is going to be only one subjective vantage point of many. So if you really have an analytical mind, I assumed you would feel the same and therefore, you know, might be interested in hearing the WHY behind what a<b>  woman</b> might object to, the REASONING behind the descenting point of view.\n\nEspecially because you still actually DON'T seem to understand what the actual issue is. You're still conflating casual attire with non-antagonizing attire. We're not talking about a guy wearing a Hawaiian shirt; no one would GIVE A SHIT if it was just a Hawaiian shirt. It's a more extreme example, but if the shirt had pictures o<b> f blac</b>k slaves picking cotton, would you still be trying to defend it?\n\nAnd speaking of giving a shit, clearly there was at least one person who is more a less a part of your community who was bothered by it. Because feminists aren't psychic; if it came to the attention of people who were only interested in the shirt, it was because at least one person watching the presentation was upset by it enough to speak up.\n\nJust now remembering what the original comment said, I chimed in because either you or someone else was claiming it was the attention being called to the shirt scaring away women from the field, not the shirt itself. And I chimed in because that's horseshit. It's the \"talking abo<b> ut raci</b>sm is racebaiting\" argument. If women ARE being driven away, then getting inside the head o<b> f a wo</b>man being offput by all of this (which is pretty damn easy for me), no, it's definitely the shirt.\n\nSo. Are you going to do the very reasonable thing of just hearing the perspective of<b>  one w</b>oman and filing it away upstairs for next time you make a judgment call about what's appropriate (In case you're wondering, yes, I am doing the same about you saying your female colleges said they weren't upset) or are you going to continue to only take into consideration \u00a0the perspectives of people who agree with you and/or exist outside the demographic in question the same way YOU exist outside the demographic in question?",

You can't just combine numbers from uneven things and say you're reasoning about the whole. STEM is by definition a combination of uneven things.\n\nI don't know how to explain this simply, except with a example. Let call it a hypothetical example, because I'm too tired to pull up the official numbers, but I do remember the numbers approximately. Computer Science has a 15-25% female students (depends on country, university, year etc) and the same exact representation in the work workforce, as far as the new generation goes. Another STEM field, biology, has 60-70% female students and the same representation in the workforce. However, employment prospects for computer science are much better than biology. When carelessly merging the numbers from the two fields, it looks like a <b> woman </b>is less hirable, but it has<b>  nothing</b> do with the fact that she is <b> a woma</b>n and everything to do with the career she tried to pursue. If you look it up, you'll see that the STEM fields that are popular among women are also among the least profitable.\u00a0So, no, you don't have evidence that women are being blocked from the workforce.\n\nThis tricky case of statistics has tricked almost every researcher the first time. It's not you fault if you were tricked (unless you studied a science, in which case shame on you). but it is the same mistake that lead feminists to claim that<b>  a wom</b>an gets paid 23% less for equal work. So be careful, if you want to be correct.\n\nIf you want to erase the disparities, not just in STEM, you need to stop beating on employers and the workplace, and start beating on those who bring up women to make poor career choices.",

I am also in STEM, a salesman of scientific solutions, and I dont see the \"professionalism\" evident in the dress code; I see it in the intellectual contributions made to the field by both women and men. We have men that wear goofie shirts and let their chest hair hang out, we have women that wear over tight pants and shirts and reveal their cleavage. This is ok. We respect each other for each others intellect, contributions, and passion, not for dress codes. As a salesman, I can not be repelled by a <b> woman </b>who bends over and has a thong hanging out, or a man that looks too casual. I have to find the good and the value in every person I deal with. I feel like this whole situation was critiqued by fashionistas. STEM people tend to be pretty quirky, the world can learn to deal with it.",

Many people get a degree and then get a job in an unrelated field. To be honest, there's no reason why women should HAVE to go into STEM jobs or any job for that matter. If women aren't staying in those jobs, it's their choice. We don't live in a society that forces people into certain careers. Also, when men are the minority in careers such as nursing or teaching, you hear a lot less complaints about it. Somehow, it's only a problem when women are a minority but not men.",

From your sample of women who work in the STEM fields, you argue that the women interested in STEM are not bothered by what outsiders bring up as cultural problems. I believe your observation to be more or less correct, but I'm not certain your explanation is (though it is a valid hypothesis).\n\nYour hypothesis seems to be that an interest in STEM subjects and not having a problem with these issues is in some way or form correlated with each other (and thus, the culture is not really a problem). From your observations of the women that work in the STEM fields, there definitely seems to be one, whether there's a direct causal link or some underlying variable that affect them both.\n\nHowever, another possible explanation is that the women who do care are somehow selected against. Only the women who do not find the culture problematic \"survive\" to become your colleagues, while the ones who do experience it as hostile to women drop out, to study other fields instead, meaning that the observed correlation is spurious.\n\nTo test which hypothesis best explains the observations, you can't look at the women who work in the field (that would give you a survivorship bias). You have to look at all the women who started out interested in working in the field, figure out how many dropped out, and furthermore why those who dropped out did so.",

I'll give you a few more pieces.\n\nThe first part is that women are not dropping out at any significant rate. The reason there are so few of them is that they never begin on this path. The percentage of women employed in STEM is the same as those graduating, which is also the same as those applying for studies.\n\nThe second part is that \"fixing\" the workplace changes <b> nothing.</b> Most prominent tech companies and institutions offer incentives and advantages to attract women, on top of an already perfectly balanced workplace. They do big gestures to convince people that they are women-friendly, and<b>  nobody</b> has good reason to doubt them. Still, the ratios don't change. It's so hopeless that Google hiring leads know openly say that they will offer advantages to women in the hiring process, in order to skew their ratios towards a 50-50.\n\nWe know, through years of research, that kids decide at a very earl<b> y ag</b>e what kind of role they are going to play. They form impression from multiple sources, including media and the general public discussion. The leads in popular movies are the biggest known predictor for what hobbies the next generation will pursue.\n\nWe don't have the means to create the next Big Bang Theory so that it has better female leads. However, at the very least we can help fix the public discussion, which right now is based on caricatures and no facts. People are just lazily guessing that something bad is going on and then passing it on as a given. The whole discussion is framed in the form of \"when are you going to stop hitting your wife?\". Girls are watching people have discussion in this context and conclude that they shouldn't <b> be enginee</b>rs. And then the same people will use the product of their own words as evidence.",

My mom and step mom are both <b> engineers </b>and I started down a STEM career path (math is the family tradition) myself before switching to an English major (the only rebellous path left). I'm a<b>  woman</b>, and while I can't say that it applies to the whole of STEM fields when I asked other women why they weren't pursuing a STEM job their answers predominantly focused on the fact they didn't think they were 'good enough at x' to pass. \n\nA large part of what I personally think the STEMS need isn't more consternation about the dressing and behavioural habbits of mal<b> e engineer</b>s (we have enough, we all get the point, reiterations on the subject nowadays feel more clickbait than illuminating) , and more on making the careers seem more 'accessible' as it were. Before I decided to follow my passion (corny I know) one thing I loved to do was show other women how the computer programs I was working on actually functioned. Lots of them thought it was a cool brain teaser of sorts and asked questions, it's just that initial hurdle of 'I'm not nerdy enough for that' that pushed most of them off. Once I showed them it's not nerdy so much as just something they hadn't been exposed to they warmed up to it a bit. \n\nOne last trend I've noticed in the STEM classes (this is all in Alaska, so while we have an iiittttty bitty sample size the one thing our university is proud of is it's engineering program, go figure) is that, on the large part, most of the people are there for the paycheck once they graduate and get a job. I'm not trying to say that a<b> ll enginee</b>rs are there for the money (again, family of math nerds, I caught my brother writing theoroms about his reflection) , but I will say that in a profession that's known for earning money and with our current economical situation, most of the people that are willing to pay for the education or go into debt for it do tend to like to think they won't be living under a debt rock their whole life. As a lady in a very lady filled department of my university (seriously, it's a clam bake. me and the other women even go to philosophy department functions just to find men to talk to) we're all dominated by our loves for the subject. Very starving artist follow my dreams stuff. I don't see as many men actually shelling out thousands of dollars of debt to follow their dreams, so it makes sense the more... pragmatic, if you will, jobs are 'manned' more by men than women.",

Plenty of them who fit perfectly into STEM, but they don't try because they are taught that STEM is a horrible industry full o<b> f sexis</b>m. Who told them that? Everyone but the people who actually do work in STEM.\n\nI should also note that all the above is abo<b> ut sexi</b>sm specifically, and not about the overall culture, which is frequently thrown into the mix of criticism.

(there was one time when my lab tech told me that i had joined a \"boys club\" - my lab - and socially it took me a long time to fit in because of that, but putting in extra effort really isn't enough to deter me from something i love as much as research)\nin contrast, when i was in 4th grade i had a passive interest in chess and math and joined the chess and math clubs respectively. i was the only girl there, and there isn't that huge of a push in these fields i think - or it's a lot more recent of a push than it is in fields like biology and chemistry, which i think are much more <b> gender </b>neutral (biology moreso than chemistry). of course as a kid i wasn't passionate about math or chess or anything, i was just trying it out, but since i didn't see anyone like me and i picked up on subtle unwelcome language cues and couldn't relate to the people around me that much, my kid self thought the fields weren't my thing and i ended up never pursuing those fields. it's sad that i still don't think math is my thing even though i took diffeq and multivariable calculus in my junior year of high school and did quite well in the classes, but i think once you internalize that something isn't your thing it's hard to get out of it. i think the point of the shirt being such a big deal is that small cues like this can really push someone out of a field, especially when they're in this entry-level stage of trying to find out what they like. he doesn't deserve the brunt of all this force, but i think people are trying to find a way to not let \"small things slide\" or get pushed under the rug, and this is what ends up happening",

If I was a <b> woman </b>who wanted to enter a STEM field, a shirt sure as hell wasn't going to change my mind - if it did, then I clearly didn't want to study a STEM field enough. Let's look at this logic from another angle - the overwhelming majority of romance novels and young adult novels are written by women as opposed to men, and a huge chunk of books that end up being turned into movie franchises (Hunger Games, Harry Potter, Divergent, Twilight, Fifty Shades, you name it) are written by women. Does that mean that men are being discouraged from becoming a romance/YA writers? Is there a culture of<b>  misandry</b> which seeks to disempower men and keep those genres dominated by women? Or is it simply that men and women have different tastes and aspirations, and as such choose to learn different career paths? You be the judge.",

A male-heavy culture exists as a result of the male majority in certain fields, simple, do not get cause and effect mixed up.\nResearch the enrollment in college and university programs -- in general the different genders take different programs for different reasons. In general men want to provide for women and a future family and so enter fields enabling room for growth in that desire -- yes even today after decades of \"feminism\", it is still expected by society and peers ( though communicated in more subtle ways than in the 1950s etc.)\nWomen do not have an equivalent drive or societal expectation -- so they (most, obviously not all) enter non-STEM programs, for various reasons... without a strong requirement to actually do something career-wise with that education.\nBecause WOMEN always have the option to be \"taken care of\" by a man -- an option that is very much not available equally to the other<b>  gender</b>. THAT is an I convenient truth, but thankfully more and more are willing to point this kind of truth out. Even at the risk of being shamed or ridiculed or shouted down -- irrational emotional methods of silencing an opposing view. (Pause...) Which says a lot about the view held by the shamers.",

I've considered that it might be perceived as communicating \"it is the norm that women are sexy, therefore women should focus on just being sexy, and not anything else,\" but if that was the point the opponents of the shirt were making, then they would not only arrive to the conclusion that it dissuades women from getting into STEM, but that it dissuades women from doing any careers outside of things like acting, modeling, porn, and other careers that largely revolve around physical appearance. No one is making such a broad claim though, so what am I missing?\nI also dislike the claim that bigotry is pleasurable being made without supporting evidence or argument. Would be an interesting subject for research; it would require some kind of video game, and something that reads brains like an FMRI.",

As if men are s<b> o se</b>x craved that they can't possibly control their behavior. That just because<b>  a wom</b>an is attractive a man will desire her, despite her entitled attitude? Or the commercials depicting men as <b> the d</b>umb dad who nee<b> ds a w</b>oman's guidance? Male and female stereotypes are both used as tools for marketers to sell you on an idea.\n\n\"Although men and women have pretty much all the same de jure rights in the US, a place like India, for instance, is a perfect example of men having more rights than women by law\"\n\nYep. totally agree. The middle east does this as well. Feminism is needed more there than in the first world where men and women have equal opportunities.\n\n\"Most female rape victims are punished for having been abused. Women don't get anything in a divorce.\"\n\nThis part was sarcasm, no? Men accused of rape are immediately assigned guilt without any evidence. Where were you when the whole rolling stone debacle went down? Or the duke lacrosse team. or jameis winston, or the hawaii quarterback who had to transfer schools, or the middle school student who was in jail for an entire year without evidence!!!!!\u00a0 I mean, seriously. Rape is a serious crime and carries a serious penalty, so it's good to take every precaution to avoid arresting someone who is innocent. As for divorce. No. Just...no. Women have always had more leverage in courts that even the most hardcore feminist don't contest it.",

Women are trailing behind when it comes to positions in STEM fields.\n\nThis video felt a lot like it emphasizes more on fact number 2 than it does on fact number 1, which just isn't something I feel is correct.\nIf we truly want each field to be equal, than surely fact 1 is just as important as fact 2.",

Why? In a lot of ways they're similar genres, so why such hostility? Because both groups thought that their genre was better and fans of the other genre were worse. As someone who as recently as January this year was a huge metal elitist, I can say with 100% confidence that that kind of tribal superiority complex is SUPER rewarding.

They want to attain the \"pleasure\" you speak of, and that is somehow fine, because there's some arbitrary consensus that what this people do is \"right.\" It is not right. Or wrong, really. It just is, like most everything else in life.\n\nThe social justice crowd are just humans, live everyone else, no matter how much they claim the opposite and to hold some philosophical and moral high ground. As simple humans, like the rest, they are greedy, power thirsty, selfish, and all the other qualities that we may at some point or another consider negative in a human being. Therefore, allowing them to ascend above others is just trading one evil for another.\n\nHowever, the social justice movement is arguably worse. I see it as a guilded cage. Yes, there may be many, many benefits. But these benefits are enforced. You will have them whether you want them or not. Contrary to what they claim, once again, the social justice movement is quite oppressive and authoritarian. Are some of their ideas good? Yes. Should we allow them to govern us? No. Should we then allow things to stay as they are? Of course not. But, a measure of moderation is required, and that is something I have yet to see from the social justice crowd.",

And it's not about scarcity in jobs, because the 40% of men are still able to get 75% of the jobs.\nIt's about culture: STEM fields are still male-dominated, and that on itself perpetuates the idea that women aren't as able at those jobs, and are thereby less likely to be hired, even when they are as qualified as the men they're up against.\n\nThe shirt is one of the many symptoms of the so-called boys club that keeps the <b> gender </b>disparity alive: the objectification of women displayed on his shirt can make women feel uncomfortable, and they'd be seen as 'too sensitive' if they were open about not liking it, and maybe even judged as less competent as a result of it. This way, only the women who either don't care or don't speak up survive in the business.\nFurthermore, it's a double standard: Matt Taylor has said he didn't get called out on wearing the shirt because people cared about his work, not his clothes.

And of course it is women who have the much more difficult time escaping the consequences of an unwanted pregnancy than men.\n\n\u00a0A single parent doesn't \"choose\" to pursue a \"career\". Getting a job is a necessity that is forced on one if one finds oneself in such a position and doesn't want to live in abject poverty.\n\nThe issue is not whether or not mothers get to have jobs, the issue is the discrimination they face in the job market. Less pay, less opportunity, less possibility of advancement. Mothers are held back more by the burden of parenthood than men. Women are the ones expected to stay home and sacrifice for their children. Because employers are loathe to allow any flexibility for their workers' outside obligations, the discrimination against parental leave falls disproportionately on women than men. Since the 60's women have been allowed into the job market, but they are now expected to fulfill all the duties of a housewife in addition to whatever career they pursue outside the home.",

I.e., women statistically are attending college more but are also still economically struggling more upon entering the job market; they're getting out of the system less than they put into it when compared to the male population. On the surface level, one would hypothesize that a demographic that has higher rates of education would also have a higher long-term income, and just based on this little bit of information, that's not what we're seeing in this case. But of course, there are a lot more factors at play than just degrees and jobs, and to really unpack the thing would require a crapload more studies and statistics than just those two. It's a very complicated phenomenon.",

I agree with you that maternity leave is a huge issue between expecting mothers and employers, however I would like to once again bring up the point that most of the time they often have the choice of having the child. As far as single parenting goes, you are right that there are more single mothers. However just because there are more single mothers currently does not mean you can discredit the growing population of single fathers. As for the consequences of pregnancy, I won't even get started on the fact that fathers have little to no choice when it comes to reproduction rights, planned or unplanned. Women and men both have their struggles when facing difficult decisions like having children. Please stop making assumptions that everyone 'expects' women to make sacrifices for their children. People expect parents to make sacrifices for their children.",

Not that it doesn't exist (both ways). It's just that there is a lack of information given on the problem, and especially the solution. We've had laws for a while that attempt to punish discrimination, not just against women but all demographics, and you can't prove or stop much of it. we also have an economy moving toward information (degree based jobs), and more young women in college.",

I value all of these fields as they provide a very valuable service to society, you however seem to only think of the monetary value.\n\nA large part of the reason why men out earn women is that fields which naturally interest women tend to be in the public sector and fields that interest men tend to be in private sector.\n\nNow first I'd like to mention that if you want a really good documentary type thing to watch I recommend you watch Hjenervask, now it is a Norwegian documentary series, and over my assumptions of what kind of person you are it will offend the living shit out of you, however it is well sourced and if you can't challenge your beliefs you shouldn't hold them in the first place.\n\nIt also deals with <b> gender </b>dominated fields and how government quotas do very little to improve the ratios, I believe the very first episode deals with the phenomena in Norway. Every episode deals with a different subject and the guy basically fly around talking to neurologists and psychologists refuting the social sciences.\n\nNow the WAGE GAP, you hold a few misconceptions about it so let me adress it.\n\nThe wage gap is the average pay of ALL women and ALL men compared to each other, IF you account for:\n\n-Overtime (Men are far more likely to work overtime as compared to women meaning that they naturally earn more working the same job with the same education and qualification)\n\n-Pregnancy leave (The popular wage gap myth doesn't account for pregnancy leave for instance)\n\n-The fact that men take more dangerous jobs (Over 90% of work related deaths are men, something women and feminists are not interested in addressing although, it would be \"equality\")\n\n-The fact that women and men simply have different interests as I've mentioned above. Here is where STEM comes into play and the big nature vs nurture debate. I'd say the jury is basically in with different quotas in Norway and Sweden aggressively pushing equal workforce in fields like nursing and engineering doing jack shit, but if you want you can keep pretending this isn't the case.\n\nLook, I'm really sorry, but men and women are different. If you want to strive towards equality that's fine, but you need to realize that we are not psychologically the same. I don't understand how feminists seem to believe that somehow men and women are vastly different when it comes to our bodies, but somehow when it comes to our<b>  mental</b> aptitude we are exactly the same.\n\nReality isn't always what we want it to be, women and men tend to be different and behave differently. You can literally observe this in every other species of mammals, why the hell would humans be any different?\n\nDifferent =/= Superior or inferior. Get that through your head.",

So, the shirt is not what keep women out of STEM fields, it is the narrative you and other social justice warrors push, that painting of us women as victims o society, the idea that we are being hold back and cannot make it, that is the exact opposite from providing motivations to girls to give it a try. So, for someone who seems to think a lot, you maybe should have thought a little more about what you are talking here about... but I guess you could not escape your own bias and jumped to the defending women mode without really realising how sexist that attitude is, even though you probably thought that you are doing the moral just thing, you failed, you made girls and women just to be <b> nothing </b>more than damsels in distress that need special attention from the men to care more about the female<b>  gender</b> then pretty much everything else.\n\nI just discovered your channel and most other videos seem much more analytical on what is going on then you did with this video here, hope this is just a bad day at the office kind of think, and that you next time consider your own bias better and try to avoid to come as sexist across as you did, since the shirt di<b> d nothin</b>g, the things you project on it is the problem.",

The attack on Matt Taylor was literally fucking ridiculous and yet another example of radical feminists attacking anyone or anything that they can find as ammo for their <b> misandry </b>and to fuel the revenue they make as speakers on the publics purse (women's studies? Literally a fucking joke). Lets get real for a fucking second. No young<b>  woman</b> is going to look at Matt Taylor and think, \"Fuck, I was going to go in to a STEM field but this guy wore a shirt with naked women on it\". The reason people hate SJW's isn't because we're afraid of losing something. It's because we're sick to fucking death of you wanker keyboard warriors picking at the scabs of society every other week and destroying peoples lives in the process. You're all a bunch o<b> f f<b> undi</b</b>>e nutcas<b> es. Gen</b>der inequality doesn't exist, neither legally or socially. Both genders have both benefits and disadvantages.",

Many guys in the stem field(some in other fields) have been ignored and looked down upon by women all there lives. The endured and existence of soul crushing defeats romantically. \n\nI know many guys like this and deep down they are sad, lonely and hopeless. Imagine what its like to watch other men succeed with women while you continually endure heartbreaks with women you never even got a chance to date.\n\nStuff like sexually explicit shirts are a way of taking back control and embracing the harsh reality that no matter what most women will never be turned on by you. Its a sort of fuck you to all the women that made them feel like shit. A way of saying \"I dont care if you think this is offensive\".",

You could argue that such are intertwined to the point of interdependency (i.e. our perceptions of others are largely determined by our immediate environment, including the media), but I honestly feel a few classes here and there about such topics, as well as some simple,  controlled self-questioning, would do wonders for our modern society.

Obviously anecdotes do not indicate trends but at a minimum we appear to be experiencing some. \n\nYour experience is different from mine. Amusingly the \"strict\" female profs I know actually complain the least about it. One of the strictest does believe it is occurring and is one of those that \"laugh it off.\" She's one of the ones who suggested I look for a female PI. Additionally, easy/difficult female/male profs seem to be pretty equal in my experience. \n\nBasically your argument suggests that a person has to explicitly say \"I hate X\" for there to be X,Y,Z motivation (plug in whatever you want here, <b> sexism,</b> etc.). As a result, we shouldn't do anything when X,Y,Z statement has not been made. Personally, I disagree with that because it is totally possible for someone to not explicitly say some similar statement but think and act on it. Here we differ, I suppose.",

For another, that is an extremely niche area within STEM, and one of the most liberal; I'm not surprised it's the first to see such a change. And what exactly do you think drives them to favor women, if not feminists putting up a fuss when women are given the short end of the stick, together with the current imbalance favoring males? Others have mentioned affirmative action, and I'd like to reiterate that the idea is to give those who have had less privilege and opportunity a fair chance versus those who have it better. You say you're annoyed at \"how they think they deserve privleges for being part of a minority group\"; yet by implying that you don't want to be treated differently from men, you're implying that you want to be treated with the same privilege they are, and that's exactly the point. I can understand the desire not to be treated like a \"delicate little flower\", but you speak as one of a lucky few who have not been discriminated against (as far as you know) or discouraged by society to enter the STEM field. I'm not trying to say women aren't strong; quite the contrary: they have to be incredibly strong to do what they do in such a world. Props to your strength and skill, and I'm glad you're speaking your mind here. But I think some of the things you're saying might be dangerous to others who have not been so lucky.\n\nI want to specifically address +TheAtomicMango and her reply to +U Go Girl: that was incredibly insensitive and ignorant, to insult someone's country without sympathy after they admitted to abuses they've suffered, and then falsely claim that it doesn't happen in ours while flaunting your entitlement that you did<b>  nothing</b> to earn. You realize that's a person you're talking to, right? And the USA is in fact at 14th in this (incomplete) list of rapes per million people:  [LINK]  and 28% of them are committed by strangers:  [LINK]  I'm especially worried for naive young women like you going to college, where supposedly one in five are sexually assaulted in the USA:  [LINK]  I'm not trying to scare you, just warn you to be careful. Just because it hasn't happened to you doesn't mean that it doesn't happen, or that it won't.\n\nFinally, I think another point worth defending is what he mentions at 2:57 in the video: that much of the trouble is in the way society discourages women from going into STEM in the first place, but people tend to interpret this as inherent differences in the sexes. Nature vs. nurture is a tough question to crack, and I'm sure there are some biological differences, but I reckon it's more nurture than these people think. The influence of media and advertising and the prejudices of parents and society in general starts at a very youn<b> g ag</b>e and is extremely deep-seated. Take the field of computer science, for example, and see the \"Why aren't more women involved in computer science?\" section here:  [LINK]  or this talk that explains it better than I do:  [LINK] \n\nThanks for listening.",

                    "commentText": "+Sean H, here are a few reactions to the points you raise. I hope you're interested enough in the topic to want to discuss it.\n\n\"I find it disheartening to see these people who have never experienced or witnessed something firsthand speak out as if that means it doesn't happen, and react to a few overzealous feminists as if that's how they all are.\"\nI also find this a bit much, but then again, the \"overzealous feminists\" you mention are among the most obvious ones because they're the ones with Tumblr accounts accusing others of all kinds of bigotted and sexist feelings. The feminists who are, say, fighting to improve women's conditions in the Middle East tend to be a little too busy with real-world issues to become as vehement in internet debates. So I'm not surprised that many people know the \"overzealous\" variety better than other types.\n\n\"For one thing, that's nice to hear. For another, that is an extremely niche area within STEM, and one of the most liberal; I'm not surprised it's the first to see such a change.\"\nSure, but note that things depend on where you look. I don't think it's \"the first\"  to see such change. In my field (linguistics, somewhere in an orbit around STEM -- see speech recognition technology), there is currently a (slight) majority of women in tenured-track positions, holding scholarships and even actually among students. This higher level of acceptance has been increasing. Certain subfields of biology also have a majority of female researchers. It's not just \"the first one\"  to see such a change; this change has been ongoing, is cascading down the line, and is supported by pretty much everybody, especially in the younger generation.\n\n\"And what exactly do you think drives them to favor women, if not feminists putting up a fuss when women are given the short end of the stick, together with the current imbalance favoring males?\"\nSure, but there is a difference between the more visible ('overzealous')  feminists, who complain about things that aren't really \"the short end of the stick\". Besides, I'd claim that a lot comes not from \"revolutionary activism\" (feminists putting up a fuss), but from internal reflection based on one's own life (having women in your family, talking to them, having peaceful conversations with feminists, equalitarians, etc. about <b> gender </b>questions) without a \"fuss.\" All in all, you have to win hearts and minds -- and \"a fuss\" is not really the best way to do that.\n\n\"Others have mentioned affirmative action, and I'd like to reiterate that the idea is to give those who have had less privilege and opportunity a fair chance versus those who have it better.\"\nSure, but if you soften your quality criteria for accepting students, you demolish the meritocracy, and you slowly sap the efficiency and high quality of the education of the institution in question. I'm all in favor of more minorities in all areas of education, but I would rather do this by improving the quality of their basic education so that they don't have any quality disadvantage when applying for higher education -- that seems to me fairer than quotas.\n\n\"You say you're annoyed at \"how they think they deserve privleges for being part of a minority group\"; yet by implying that you don't want to be treated differently from men, you're implying that you want to be treated with the same privilege they are, and that's exactly the point.\"\nTrue -- but that is ismply because, in many cases (e.g., affirmative action), what is being asked is not 'the same privileges they have', but actually more or stronger privileges, presumably to offset a disadvantage. I don't think many people these days would subscribe to a<b>  gender</b>-centric (non-meritocratic) vision of education (\"only for boys\"); what upsets people is that measures that are supposed to redress the differences appear to be (and sometimes really are) not doing that, but simply allowing underqualified people to get into institutions where they shouldn't really be, because they were not adequately prepared for them.\n\n\"I can understand the desire not to be treated like a \"delicate little flower\", but you speak as one of a lucky few who have not been discriminated against (as far as you know) or discouraged by society to enter the STEM field.\"\n'Lucky few'  begs the question of statistics. As I said, in my field, that is not at all the case. We need some hard data here, if we want to argue for the need for some kind of behavior.\n\n\"I'm not trying to say women aren't strong; quite the contrary: they have to be incredibly strong to do what they do in such a world.\"\nHmmm... Again, this sounds more like chivalry than like hard data.\n\n\"But I think some of the things you're saying might be dangerous to others who have not been so lucky.\"\nWhy? And how? I think Tomato is simply saying that people should strive to do their best, and be judged accordingly. To the extent that htis happens -- and I would claim her case is not simply that of a small minority -- she's actually right.\nYou don't protect or help victims by telling them they shouldn't be fighting to improve themselves and get ahead, that it's the world that should be saying \"sorry\" to them. BOTH things can be true simultaneously, and should happen simultaneously; but so many minority activists strive for the latter without doing much for the former, not even in the form of lip service!...\n\n\"Finally, I think another point worth defending is what he mentions at 2:57 in the video: that much of the trouble is in the way society discourages women from going into STEM in the first place, but people tend to interpret this as inherent differences in the sexes.\"\nAgain, I'd like to see some hard evidence connecting these two -- in my field, this is not true at all.\n\n\"Nature vs. nurture is a tough question to crack, and I'm sure there are some biological differences, but I reckon it's more nurture than these people think.\"\nThat's a personal opinion. Maybe I reckon it's more nature than nurture. I suppose we need the research here, right? (Notice also that saying something is an innate biological difference doesn't mean we can't change that: as DNA manipulation techniques improve, we should be able to increase and/or decrease any capacity in women, or in men, that we think we should. So biological doesn't mean \"unchangeable\").\n\n\"The influence of media and advertising and the prejudices of parents and society in general starts at a very youn<b> g ag</b>e and is extremely deep-seated.\"\nAgain, I'd like to see the research. Personally, I think there is a very complicated relation between the media, prejudices, etc. and the individual. Activists tend to see it as a simple relation: these things are evil, have no good effects, and we should change them fundamentally or get rid of them. Sin<b> ce nothi</b>ng in life in simple, I am somewhat sketpic about this. I think people influence advertising, the media, etc. just as much as they are influenced by them -- it's a give-and-take relation, not an imposition from above. The media ain't that powerful, and people ain't that weak and impressionable, I reckon.\n\nThanks for your opinions, and have a nice evening!",

                    "commentText": "+Asehpe Hey, this is awesome. I'm certainly interested enough to discuss it, and I appreciate you taking the time to address my points! \n\nI hope it's cool that I numbered your paragraphs for brevity, starting with the second one:\n\n1. (\"I find it...\") Agreed: as in many areas, it's likely the noisy/offensive/melodramatic ones getting a disproportionate amount of the attention that leads to this perception that (I think) errs on the negative side. (Maybe I'm just another one of those.)\n\n2. (\"For one thing...\") Quite fair: I should have said \"one of the earlier ones\" or some such. In general, your response makes me wish I'd thought mine out better, which is a welcome lesson.\n\n3. (\"And what exactly...\") Agreed, and this partly comes down to semantics and what constitutes a \"fuss\", which admittedly I didn't specify. Regardless, I love your last point\u2014with a nuanced subject like this, winning hearts and minds requires a calm, respectful, patient approach, and outrage and emotion aren't good ways to convince anyone. I don't mean to say yelling and screaming made this happen, yet when I hear that women are twice as likely to be given positions in a department that has historically favored men, I can't help but imagine there's more than purely conscientious motivation involved and, at this point in time, necessary for significant change. (Or maybe I'm overly cynical; regarding universities, maybe, but surely not regarding everywhere.) So the fuss I speak of is the negative attention I think they're partly trying to avoid, and the more visible feminists, though liable to overdo things, do contribute to this. I shouldn't have spoken like it's the only motivator, though.\n\n4. (\"Others have mentioned...\") \n5. (\"You say you're annoyed...\")\nHmm... I do see the same ideal future. As for how to get there, and the arguments for and against affirmative action, I probably shouldn't speak of things I know so little about, so I'm going to shush about it for now.\n\n6. (\"I can understand...\")\nYour field aside (though it's nice to hear of the equality; and I think it's fair to call it STEM, what with it being the scientific study of language; and this isn't really relevant but I think it's SUCH A COOL SUBJECT), doesn't the number of women going into STEM positions today count as hard data? Evan mentioned a few statistics at 2:40 in the video. My field is computer science, and though it is gradually changing, it is still massively one-sided, and projected to be so through 2022 (again I quote this site:  [LINK]  As for arguing for the need for some kind of behavior, I'll save that for paragraph #8.\n\n7. (\"I'm not trying...\")\nAh... Here I probably wanted to dispel the notion that I was being overly patronizing, or chivalrous (a kind way to put it). I do believe what I said, but if that's why I felt the need to say it, it's probably because I was indeed being that way. Ha! Apologies for that.\n\n8. (\"But I think...\")\nI heartily concur with all you're saying here, and I don't think it conflicts with what I meant, but I was unspecific, so I'll try to clarify. Let's look at her last sentence in particular: \"if a fucking shirt prevents you from doing what you love, may be you didn't love it that much in the first place???\" I think I understand her point with the same interpretation as you, that women\u2014like anyone\u2014should stand up for themselves and not expect to be pitied or babied (or infantilized) by anyone. And I'm not arguing that. But in this case, she's also saying if you REALLY want to work in your chosen field, you shouldn't be frightened off by evidence that your peers in that field may well objectify and mistreat you based on what you are, not your merit. (That's what the shirt suggested to me, anyway, as it's something I've known to happen in my field; for a taste, see this blog post by a <b> woman </b>leaving a relatively prestigious position because of its community dynamic\u2014it's not primarily<b>  sexism</b> that pushed her out, but that's a part of it:  [LINK]  The point I take from such stories is that changing a community as one of the minority is incredibly slow and difficult and painful, and not something that anyone should be expected to undertake if they don't have to.) So my issue is that I find this to be a perfectly valid reason for someone not to enter a field, despite being interested otherwise, and thus I find it a failure on the part of the community, not the individual being discouraged from joining it. In other words, when you say both things should happen simultaneously, I completely agree, but I worry that words like Tomato's are helping one while hurting the other, just as those of the overprotective SJWs do in reverse. I imagine for most people it won't make a difference, but for some, it's more ammunition against feminism.\nAll that being said, I can appreciate just about everything Tomato said, especially after hearing your points, and I'm glad it's being said. I just feel that the other side is being under-represented here. (I see your comment above mentioning your willingness to listen, and I appreciate you turning that toward me!)\n\n9. (\"Finally...\")\nI think my response to #6 applies here too.\n\n10. (\"Nature vs. nurture...\")\n11. (\"The influence...\")\nI suppose we do need the research. Here's a bunch, referenced through a blog post:  [LINK] \nMy opinion here also has a lot to do with the femal<b> e engineer</b>s in my life. For example, observing the personalities of my mechanical-engineer friend and her materials-scientist sister and hearing how their parents raised them in a purposely gender-neutral way has called into question much of what I once believed to be inherently female traits.\nAnd I don't mean to say the adults targeted by advertising, TV, movies, etc. are so impressionable: more so their children.\nIn the end, I reckon (I suppose I am stealing this meaning from southern U.S. colloquialism) that time will reveal the truth: young people, as you mentioned, are especially amenable to these ideas, and it will affect how they raise their own children, y'all.\n\nThanks again for the thoughtful response, and have a good one!",

But the enjoyment of power - the sadism - that activates <b> sexism,</b><b>  racism</b> and other kinds of prejudice is also present in the fashioning of moral codes with which - perhaps rightly - we condemn others. Two thinkers come straight to mind here: Nietzsche's discussion of the genealogy of morality; and Lacan's notion that the history of philosophy is the history of desire - that is, there is something in our ethics that is not part of our moral framework. Forget this and one will practice one's own sadism in blissful ignorance. What shivers of delight so many SJWs feel when they have another person to 'call out'... and this sadism is all the more sadistic - and invisible and powerful - because it is 'doing good' for its subject. This is why, although I didn't like his shirt either, it is absolutely the case that Taylor was crucified by social media.",

But to me, believing in the \"oppression crap\" actually helps me closen the cap between genders, seeing as i personally hope that <b> gender </b>wouldn't matter as nearly much as it does nowadays.\nAlso, i really don't think radical feminists are proper feminists because they fail to follow the basic definition of the word, \"equality for all genders\". And as you probably know, radical feminists only favor women and often insult men or think that they are the worse<b>  gender</b>.  This happens because they usually feel the need to revenge to men that have been sexist towards them.\nAnd one more thing to add. Saying \"life sucks for men too\" really makes me doubt if you read my original reply, as i'm sure i mentioned that feminis<b> m=gende</b>r equality. So that's why it's pretty much the same thing as saying \"not all men\".",

I don't see how believing in the oppression helps to closen a gap, since that leads only to the issues men have getting ignored in favour of supposed women's issues, of which plenty are completely imaginary, since they are based on forged statistics by feminists to create the paranoid view that we live in an oppression. How do you plan to end this paranoid oppression?

All the hard work for fighting for women's rights in the past has built up to complaining over a shirt. And while that was going on <b> woman </b>in Saudi Arabia are being stoned to death for doing absolutely<b>  nothing</b>. Is feminism really needed here? No, not really, today the name is used b<b> y woma</b>n who feel they are being held-back, when in reality women today in our culture are put on a pedestal. They claim to fight for equality, yet they some women don't hold themselves to the same standard as men. You know how you're told to never hit<b>  a wom</b>an? Has anyone realized how much of a double standard that is? You know how when men say something disrespectful t<b> o a wo</b>man? They get slapped, to society that's okay. But what if the roles were reversed? Would it then be okay for the man to hit<b>  the w</b>oman? Society say's \"NOPE! It is never okay\" and why exactly is never really explained. I think it's because women are seen as weak and tend to get more empathy because of it. With men it's completely different, you're a man right? Stand up for yourself, you've probably been told to never be a pushover right? Never take shit from anyone, and that's when the double standard really starts to show. Look if we're fighting for equality, why can't everyone be under the same standard? Do you think women are just as capable as men? Then why is society perpetuating this double standard bullshit?",

Simply making the claim that something is sexist (or the result o<b> f sexis</b>m) doesn't make it so. Some women were offended by his shirt, some weren't. It's really as simple as that.

Just the same as women ask to not be judged by how they dress, and that if you're distracted by what they wear that's your problem get back to work, it's the same the other way around. And it isn't like he wore a swatika, or a shirt that sai<b> d \"wom</b>an are objects, let's disrespect them\", or anything clearly and undeniably sexist. It just offends some peoples tastes, and it horrors them that others may have the same tastes as well.

                    "commentText": "@Aveline De Grandpr\u00e9 I see where you're coming from, but a field being dominated by men should incentivize, not frighten women when it comes to joining. A person fearing alienation or being unwelcome in a given field is often unnecessarily worried. Male friendship is imperative to us males as well, but the professional environment shouldn't have to be subject to our personal social preferences. In fields of science, people pick their professions based on what they like - not which <b> gender </b>is most prevalent. A high-schooler might reconsider their place of education in case of<b>  gender</b> overrepresentation, but we're talking about people with years of experience and dedication, judging one another not based on genitalia, but merit.\n\nAnxiety - especially social anxiety - and not being \"particularly comfortable\" with a job based o<b> n gende</b>r disparencies are two completely different things. A person with legitimate anxiety is crippled in situations and needs to reset his/her life completely to change. Women feeling uneasy about jobs because of an overrepresentation of men is a problem that can be fixed. Not by drastically changing the system, but by assuring these worried women you talk about that their fear is misplaced.\n\nAnd hey I don't want to sound harsh; if I was in that position I'd probably be a bit uneasy, sure. It's a scary thing when you're alone in a crowd. But if I opted out because of that, I wouldn't blame anyone and I wouldn't claim to have had undying passion for the field. True passion doesn't negate incoming challenges, true passion makes people great in spite of those challenges. That's what is driving scientific research forward, that's what's giving us these brilliant minds, and I'd hate for such a great endeavour of humankind to be downplayed because of a fucking shirt.",

But the problem lies in the fact that so many other women shy away from it. Especially considering that these are high-paying jobs they're missing out on.\u00a0\n\nI think the strong western patriarchal society we once had is still echoing today. In institutions, women (especially women of color), are underrepresented. No particular <b> gender </b>is at fault here, but I think the best solution is to urge more women into these male dominated industries and thereby encourage other women to follow along.\n\nFriendly relations with people from your own<b>  gender</b> is generally important to everyone, but I think, broadly speaking, men do not feel threatened by entering a female dominated field (as +Turtoi Radu) pointed out. The reason women most often feel unsettled or anxious, is because they fea<b> r sexis</b>m, microaggressions, harassment and alienation.\n\nAlso, yes I agree that a person with anxiety disorder should seek professional help, but there are many different contexts in which the term \"anxiety\" can be understood. For example, \"I'm anxious to have the criminal caught\" or, \"I'm anxious about performing this presentation\".\u00a0\n\n\"True passion doesn't negate incoming challenges, true passion makes people great in spite of those challenges.

On that spectrum, women usually do cleaning, as backbreaking as trash collecting, but the pay is worse and it is less regulated.\u00a0\n\n\nNurses do a job that is almost as qualified as being a doctor, but is also back breaking (washing and moving patients) and get less pay for it.\u00a0\n\n\nSo, from my point of view, when there is a <b> gender </b>bias against men in a job it is usually because it requires more education and pays less or is plain worse. \n\n\nThere are many jobs that I would never want.<b>  Nothing</b> in the health industry, for instance. But the first time I made the exact same amount of my male peers was when I started working for the government. While I worked as a programmer  they  always found an excuse to pay me slightly less. Even on the government I have spent many years proving that I am not a secretary. None of my male colleagues  where ever asked to place a call or fetch coffee. Trust me, I was watching.",

                    "commentText": "@Jessica Wollstonecraft\u200b\u200b that was the worst attempt at sophistry I have ever seen. Women don't want to be like other women you imbecile, they want to do what they feel comfortable with and enjoy. How about trans men, they obviously don't to want be like other women, or can't anyway. Most women think alike and most men think alike, so in a free society, when choosing what one wants to do for a living, it's largely based on personal choice. You know just like the first two women to complete navy ranger school, or the ever growing women in STEM, they chose to do these things because they wanted to, just as much as the women who chose to enter early childhood education, or the women who decided to pursue those \"useful\" <b> gender </b>studies degrees.\ufeff\n\nEdit, January 12, 2016: the reason why men, on average, choose certain jobs that differ from the jobs women choose, and vice versa, is because men and women have different brains.\n\n\"Females and males maintain unique brain characteristics throughout life. Male brains, for instance, are about 10% larger than female brains. But bigger doesn't necessarily mean smarter.\n\nDisparities in how certain brain substances are distributed may be more revealing. Notably, male brains contain about 6.5 times more gray matter -- sometimes called 'thinking matter\" -- than women. Female brains have more than 9.5 times as much white matter, the stuff that connects various parts of the brain, than male brains. That's not all. \"The frontal area of the cortex and the temporal area of the cortex are more precisely organized in women, and are bigger in volume,\" Geary tells WebMD. This difference in form may explain a lasting functional advantage that females seem to have over males: dominant language skills.\"\n\n [LINK] ",

                    "commentText": "@antiantipoda did you just conflate nurses and <b> doctors,</b> that doesn't make any sense. Notice how you said \"nurses do a job almost as qualified as being a doctor\" the key word there is almost, and even at that you're completely wrong:\n\n\"Apart from that,<b>  doctors</b> are limited to their specialized field whereas nurses are able to work across several wards or units depending on their job descriptions<b> . Doctor</b>s need to be specialized in order to fully assess the roots of an illness or a problem. For nurses, their specialty is more task-oriented and patient-oriented. Once a doctor is convinced that a patient's condition is out of his specialty range, he will refer the patient to a colleague who has a better understanding of that condition. The nurses, however, are to inform the replacement doctor of the patient's condition and subsequently follow up with the patient's progress until he/she leaves the hospital.\n\nIn addition, nurses enjoy a closer relationship with their patients as compared <b> to docto</b>rs since they have more direct contact with th<b> em. Doct</b>ors also have a constant need to detach themselves emotionally from a patient so as to be able to continue with their work. As a result, patients will often times identify better with nurses than <b> with doc</b>tors, usually showing their preference by the form of the co-operation they offer.\n\nOn top of <b> that, do</b>ctors need to read a lot and thus take a longer time to acquire new and accurate knowledge whereas nurses rely more on their experience to provide the best treatment possible. This is not to say that nurses do not study and advance in terms of education levels. Nurses in fact are able to study for\u00a0bachelor's degrees,\u00a0master's degrees\u00a0and\u00a0doctorate degrees\u00a0in nursing.\n\nTherefore, the more education a nurse receives, the better the chances of gaining better income levels. This sometimes brings an overlap of authority that becomes a source of disputes b<b> etween d</b>octors and <b> nurses. </b>Doctors generally have authority over their patient's conditions and treatment and will then require the nurses to implement certain procedures. However, when priorities <b> collide,</b> doctors may need to succumb to the authority figures of Head Nurses or Head Units since the latter group has managerial control over a specific ward, floor or unit. The same authority overlap problem also occurs when new p<b> racticin</b>g doctors first join a medical facility. Experienced nurses tend to question analysis given by<b>  the you</b>ng doctors since nurses' knowledge is based on actual past experiences, not from theories. Nevertheless, in general, the two share a mutual respect for each other's responsibilities.\"",

                    "commentText": "+R. Ringshifter Hey guys, what's going on here? You sound confused about the facts... Well, I'm pretty well-educated in (intersectional) feminism, so I'm here to help you out if you'd like. Ask me anything you want to know, I might be able to help you out.\n\nLet's begin with the clear question: Why does it matter that STEM fields are male-dominated?\nFirst sub-question: Would the shirt be less sexist if STEM fields weren't male-dominated? Here's the thing: If it wasn't a male-dominated field, the shirt-incident never would have happened. Why not? Well, in a field where women are fairly represented and comfortable enough to voice the issues they have at work, he would've gotten called out way before the interview even happened. It doesn't really matter if it would be one of the women to call him out, or one of the regulations that are in place to make women feel accepted; it just doesn't happen in those kinds of places. Proof is empirical, though I accept counter-evidence.\nThis actually goes on to answer the question: the shirt is a symptom of the field being male-dominated, so it makes sense to take the male-dominated factor into account.\n\nAlso important: the STEM fields being male-dominated is actually something we as a society are trying to fix, mostly by finding ways to encourage girls to enter those studies. But what if all that effort was for naught, because the women that got a degree then don't get jobs? That's where the 60%/25%-disparity comes in: apparently there are factors that make qualified women unable (or unwilling) to get a job.\nThis is because the STEM fields are a 'boys club': a field where the atmosphere is based on what makes men comfortable, gives men easier access to promotion and assumes men's capability, with the opposite being true for women. The shirt is a symptom of the boys' club: none of his male colleagues found personal offense in his shirt's depiction of women as <b> sex </b>objects, so he never got complaints about it. The<b>  sexual</b> way he talked about the Rosetta-mission is also a great indicator that this isn't such a female-friendly field.\nIn the end, the attacking of the shirt represents us standing up to this atmosphere as a whole.",

                    "commentText": "+Anouk Fleur Reasonable point. \n\nI think you are probably right about the shirt and that was a good addressing of the first point. However, I don't think Nerdwriter really makes that clear in his video (so I still think this is one of his worst). \n\nAnd I agree all about STEM being a boys'-club and that - I realise that. I just didn't connect that to it's relationship with the shirt and this discussion really. I still think it's a bit incorrectly stated, because really, if STEM was a gender-neutral field, and the shirt still somehow got in an interview (which I agree would probably be a lot less likely but I think still possible) it would probably be just as controversial and garner a pretty much identical reaction. \n\nAlso, I still stand by my second point that this video tries too hard (or seems to) to demonise this guy. I pretty much feel this was a faux-pas and not really much more. Sure, the shirt probably grew out of an art style which grew out of a sort of <b> sexism,</b> but I'm not sure I'd characterise it as necessarily sexist. I certainly don't think the guy was deriving any kind of sick social pleasure out of the wearing of the shirt - at worst, he was just being quite ignorant.",

I do and I could wear that shirt tomorrow, <b> nobody </b>would give two shits. In reality people just don't care what \u00a0I would wear. Was the shirt well thought out? no, I don't think so. Was it particularly harmful? no, certainly not. If it weren't for that outcry, the only takeaway would've been the commet landing, motivitating any aspiring astronomer. In fact, I'd wager that this did more harm then the shirt itself.\n\nAnd seriously, regulations to make women feel accepted? This repeating theme of women being precious butterflys that will break at the mere mention of anything seems \u00a0extremely prelevalent in feminism (and is quite sexist at that). We are talking about the real world, where women have a spine and can say what they want without needing regulations.\n\n\"That's where the 60%/25%-disparity comes in: apparently there are factors that make qualified women unable (or unwilling) to get a job.\"\n\nYes, there are factors at play, mostly the lack of women actually studying stem fields. However, feminism apparantly doesn't care that much about investigating what factors could be at play and prefer protesting.\n\nEven at our campus, those idiots appeared, demanding a bigger female representation. Do you want to know what the result is? Females are massively preferred during hiring. Isn't this amazing? feminism actually succeeded in creating even more<b>  sexism</b>. How am I not supposed to hate this?\n\nGranted, protesting the shirt is a step in the right direction in that it at least appears to focus one of the factors. But did it really have to go as far as harassing that guy until he cries? A letter/opinion piece would've gotten the message across quite clearly but instead those social justice wariors wasted someone's time who does actual research. His time is far more valuable then yours.\n\n\"club': a field where the atmosphere is based on what makes men comfortable, gives men easier access to promotion and assumes men's capability, with the opposite being true for women.\"\n\nBullshit. How dare you even imply that those are the only factors at play? Women are actively encouraged and preferred. There are more grants available, they have higher hiring chances and the entire school system is better geared towards girls; After graduation, the focus is on research.\n\nLet's talk about plausible factors; For one, there's a biological difference right from the get-go. Furthermore, there are more inteligent males then there are females. These are qualities that are emphasized in stem fields. Then there may be societal pressure, an issue that won't be solved by campaigning a shirt.\n\n\"Th<b> e sexua</b>l way he talked about the Rosetta-mission is also a great indicator that this isn't such a female-friendly field.\"\n\nThis bit made me unsure if I should even bother writing a reply as this seemed just too trolly. It's really hard to tell with you feminists.\n\n\"In the end, the attacking of the shirt represents us standing up to this atmosphere as a whole.\"\n\nFunny, the message didn't really get across to dr matt taylor.",

Women in the west are one of the most privileged group in the whole world and still we all think they need protection from society. Are we not asserting dominance on women by telling them they're too weak to be able to gain merit in STEM fields without us cushioning every-damn wall? I respect women enough to think they're strong enough to not be phased by someone's shirt. You see, although it's true we shouldn't bring hate into this, your argument eats itself from the inside because it can be used by both sides in the same way. Social Justice Warriors only do it because they seek the same desire of dominance, if your right. Shirtstorm was one of the stupidest things to ever happen and the people who feel bad about a shirt don't deserve to be respected as mentally strong people are. If a shirt is so offensive it keeps you from following your dreams, you don't deserve to accomplish your dreams.\n\nBesides, everyone only gets pissed off about the sexualized imagery of women because only women (feminists actually) give a fuck about it. If it was a female psychologist wearing a colorful shirt full of male bodies or whatever, no one would give the slightest of fucks.

He wasn't being a 'winner' - \"Hey I got one over you ladies, you'll never have this kind of job and career, hahaha, men are better, I'm going to wear a depiction of you in scantily clad clothes to assert my dominance.\" I really really doubt that was the subconcious thinking that led him to wear that shirt. In fact that's what we should ask: why did he wear that shirt? Maybe he thought it empowered women, maybe he thought a guy wearing a cool shirt would get the attention of kids, both boys and girls - and it ha<b> d nothin</b>g to do with subconsciously enjoying institutionalized male status.\u00a0\n\nThe point is you automatically labelled the guy's behavior as sexist without even asking the guy why he wore it. More than anything, we all should know a picture or video NEVER gives the full context about the intentions of a person. So I think before you label his behavior as sexist - you should ask him. Otherwise, you're just using a picture out of context to justify your framework - not find the real truth.",

What I cannot accept and certainly not approve of is the manner in which shirtgate played out. Making a grown man who also happened to be a genius cry on camera for something so banal, so unimportant as the shirt he was wearing for a few minutes on an interview. A man who just achieved the unachievable and landed a spacecraft on a comet, I mean just think about that.\nMeeting a person who is so gentle at heart and so intelligent and so significant in human history with this much hate and bigotry, when in fact he should have received celebration and praise, and then patting yourself on the back for doing it, I find that to be absolutely revoltingly disgusting and I am repulsed by anyone who can find the audacity in themselves to defend it.",

However, while<b>  misogyny</b> has vastly been eliminated from any\u00a0legislation in the U.S., it still exists in everyday life, which has the most impact on girls, I think. That is my\u00a0answer to\u00a0your question, \"where does it come from?\"It is\u00a0true that society both encourages and discourages girls from going into STEM fields at the same time. For example, growing up, I saw all these politically correct campaigns about how girls are just as smart and capable as boys, but then I would return to my everyday life and be reminded that I was to grow up and be a mother, a nurturer, etc. Look in the toy aisle at Wal-Mart if you do not believe that I was influenced to think this way. It is filled with soft, domestic things for girls, and tough, manly things for boys. And that's tragic for BOTH genders! Boys should not have to put up a masculine, unemotional front every day of their lives, just as girls shouldn't have to follow traditionally feminine roles.I'm just\u00a0an 18-year-old girl; I'm not a follower of feminist blogs, and I am in no way a radical feminist.\u00a0Likewise, I have no groundbreaking theory on how to fi<b> x sexis</b>m, either,\u00a0but I do know that pointing o<b> ut sexi</b>sm when I see it is the right thing to do--whether it<b>  is sex</b>ism against women OR men!\u00a0I do NOT hate men.

You come across very balanced and reasonable.\n\n\nYou're right in pointing out <b> sexism </b>when you see it but often this can be a bit misleading. Let's take your example for the toy-collection in a local supermarket. The company that sells those toys isn't trying to be sexist, they try to make as much profit as possible. If they could sell the same toys that they make for boys to girls, they wouldn't hesitate for a second. The truth is, they can't and any attempt to do so results in a loss of profit.\n\n\nThis phenomenon has been studied, take for example this study\u00a0 [LINK]  . Granted, the sample size is pretty small (it is psychology after all...) but the same has been repeated for different primates with analogous results. This suggests that there may very well be differences between male and female brains on average.\n\n\nThis is the problem with trying to point out<b>  sexism</b> and hoping it will change things. When I point out that there are barely an<b> y blac</b>k people in my country's government and that this is a sign <b> of raci</b>sm, I may be trying to do good but the truth is that there simply aren't that m<b> any bl</b>ack people in this country. When trying to do good by pointing out inequalities, it's important to find out where they come from instead of simply protesting them.\n\n\nThis all isn't to say that there aren't any societal influences at play, there may very well be. It's important to never discriminate based on statistical averages, it's what a movement striving for equality should move towards (also, why feminism and not egalitarianism?). However, I think we're past this point.\n\n\nYou say you're 18, if you're going to university or college next year, I hope you consider stem. I think I speak for most of my colleagues in saying that a more diverse group would liven up the place.",

However, I don't\u00a0agree with\u00a0the other examples you used. The toy companies can't sell \"boyish\" toys to girls because of reasons beyond simple biological differences. From birth, we treat girls differently. We handle them as if they are fragile and delicate, whereas we roughhouse boys. (I'm sure you've encountered this concept before. This is a well-known study:  [LINK]  We also play different games with boys than girls; we are more inclined to teach girls to play domestic games like house, and boys baseball, soccer, etc. Our brains are different, but the social influences in our lives augment these differences. The other example you use is pointing out that <b> black </b>people are a minority in our government. I would agree with what you said if you didn't grossly overlook that even though they are a minority, they are still disproportionately underrepresented in our country!

Furthermore, underrepresentation in the U.S. would still make sense as in general,<b>  black</b> people have less money and politics is primarily a rich men's game. Protesting inequality in governement would therefore be the wrong move (stupid at best, harmful at worst), you'd have to find out why there is a difference in earnings.\n\n\nAnd while there are reasons beyond biological differences, the source you cite even admits that it's difficult to distinguish between nurture and nature. If the differences are mostly nurture then surely the problem will be solved by having less sexist parents, not by forcing target to remove their gender-specific toys?\n\n\nIf the main source of this societal pressure are the parents themselves then not only will this problem be solved by our generation, feminists should be informing parents. But that is not what they're doing, is it? They're lobying for extra grants for femal<b> e engineer</b>s, they're trying to close the paygap by artificially giving female-employees more mone<b> y (sexi</b>sm at it's finest). It's gotten so bad that in my field, a female with the same qualifications as me will have a 2 to 1 advantage when applying for a job.\n\n\nI don't think you sounded rude but you did misrepresent my point. I don't think pointing out inequality is harmful in itself. It's just that you need to know the cause before you can properly protest. To demonstrate this point, here's a bit of history.\n\n\nThe country I live in is split into two parts (actually three but the third one is negligably small). The northern part speaks flemish, the southern part speaks french. Because of historical reasons, the northern part has more industry and is on average wealthier. More governement grants should go to that part because there is a more pressing need for infrastructure. However, in the past people pointed out this inequality between the two halves. With their mindless lobying they succeeded until relatively recently in creating the \"wafelijzerpolitiek\". When a big project needed money in the northern part, they'd seek out an equally expensive project in the south and fund them at the same time. This resulted in ineffective spending and a loss of a lot of taxpayer money.\n\n\nMayoring in english literature? Not all hope is lost, you're still young.

There was a great study on the effects of culture on job choice where several researchers tested kids from <b> age </b>10, 6, 3 and 6 months<b>  old</b> about what kind of things they would like to be in hundreds of different ways and found overwhelmingly the same results. Furthermore they also looked at the trends between education rates an<b> d gende</b>r equality and the types of jobs that those genders tend to go towards. As the equality divide lessened, there was a disparity on job wants. To put it simply, in countries like Sweden and UK, girls BY FAR, EMPIRICALLY SHOW that they want to lean towards more 'traditional' styles of jobs. I am so sick of everything being blamed on culture as if men and women have the same brains. Why is it so easy for people to think \"men and womens bodys and hormones differ but in the brain they are the same.\" Equal opportunity does not mean equal results.\u00a0\n\nI also find it hilariously ironic that they criticise this guy who landed stuff on a fucking comet for wearing a shirt, then go on and protest about letting women wear what they want without being judged and how it is harassment.

I think a sober-minded view on the subject, that also illustrates the complexity of the phenomena we're talking about, is Susan Fiskes theory of ambivalent<b>  sexism</b>. What she, and others, have noted is that so called \"benevolen<b> t sexis</b>m\" is cross-culturally correlated with so called \"hosti<b> le sexi</b>sm\". Ideas about women being beautiful, innocent, precious, good, and kind often co-occur with ideas about women being weak, fragile, deceptive, things to own, things to control etc. (and if I recall correctly, correlated within cultures too).\n\nThere is no dirty secret ab<b> out sex</b>ism bec<b> ause se</b>xism isn't one thing. It's a clusterfuck of different processes. Often it's simply about beliefs and assumptions. It's viewing women as very different creatures than men. Sometimes it's about motivation, like I imagine being heterosexual messes with your head and often prompts you to put all women into the<b>  same m</b>ental box. Sometimes it's about visibility. Seeing male as the default human being. Sometimes it's about power. Sometimes it's about ideology. Sometimes it's about religion.\n\nWhy were people upset about shirt gate? here's my two cents: I think it varies from person to person. But I think for the most part that it wasn't about STEM males being afraid that girls would enter their boys club, but maybe sometimes. I think it often was people feeling like they've been equally sexist at other times and that thus the accusation was vicariously also about them. So they got defensive. So they went too far, like people always do when they get defensive. So they found an attraction in a narrative about how all the evil feminists have come to ruin science with<b>  their</b> fuzzy bullshit, cause that narrative works well to extinguish their self-doubt about their own moral standing.\n\"They're saying I'm evil? I say they're the evil ones!\"\nAnti-feminists are constantly waiting for feminists to say something overly sensitive so that they can say \"look at how overly sensitive this is\", \"they're professional victims I tell you!\"",

Ultimately, the main argument being used against this man is that while his shirt isn't inherently and single-handedly oppressing women out of STEM fields, it is a minor contribution to the force that keeps men so heavily in the majority within these fields.\n\nMy issue with that argument is that I don't really see the other forces at hand. If this shirt is the <b> snowflake </b>to the avalanche of<b>  sexism</b> keeping women out of STEM, I don't think it's snowing. I have seen no compelling evidence showing women actively or even passively being pushed out of these fields. Certainly, the statistics you cited about how women aren't getting as much recognition once they are trying to be published are troubling, and undoubtedly an issue, but even that to me doesn't feel like a particularly compelling argument to say why women aren't going into STEM.\n\nFurther, I don't think it's at all unfair to say that women may just not be as interested in STEM as men are naturally. There's an extreme aversion nowadays about anything one says that even creates a minor amount of basic and genera<b> l gende</b>r differences. I don't think that's healthy, and I think it only perpetuates the things it tries to prevent. The sense I get from many of my female friends isn't a longing for a job in these fields while being discouraged by t<b> he sexi</b>sm, most of them just don't actually have any interest, which is totally fine. Likewise, while there may be forces at play keeping a man from being a Kindergarten teacher, I wouldn't say it's at all unfair to say that men are probably less likely to even want to be Kindergarten teachers in the first place out of the intrin<b> sic gen</b>der differences leading females to pursue that job and men not to.\n\nCertainly, based on the actual objective information you presented here, there is a definite and preventable problem that could be keeping women out of STEM. Whether or not it is, it needs to be fixed. Regardless, I think that using a guy's shirt as a catalyst for that discussion makes the discussion sound trivial, and will only lead to further the divide between genders.\n\nLike you said, the <b> most co</b>mmon reaction was annoyance. When I first heard about the story, I thought, \"Ugh, Jesus, seriously?\" and it actively made me less engaged to the topic. Like I said, I think picking something like this to jump off with is ridiculous, and the discussion surrounding this whole event is totally toxic.",

Okay, I'm following you there, but then you don't bother to draw any kind of link between the shirt and the <b> gender </b>disparity in STEM as though it's just obvious that shirts depicting the female form are obviously an example of why that disparity exists. I don't buy that one follows from the other. The disparity is important, and worth thinking about. The shirt, unless you can draw some valid causal relationship, is not. That's the point.

So it's not a personal fashion choice as so it is a gesture of friendship to Elly Prizeman to wear the shirt she made for him. Now there is very little that can be proven that just because this man is wearing the shirt would repulse women to seeking employment in scientific fields. I would even question the level of intelligence of a <b> woman </b>who is offended and gets deterred because of \"misogynistic\" undertones purveyed by men in the field.\n\n\u00a0I don't understand why we must pay attention to women or men who seek to divert attention from one man's achievement to something as meaningless as his shirt. We are stunting women's growth by consistently lumping individual adversity to collective adversity and putting efforts to remove them both. Which this brings back the campaign Bossy, which was to promote to ban the word \"bossy\". It was made for the the benefit to women to not be called bossy and for the world to fall in line with it. Which is contrive because who really says bossy? I can think of another mainstream word that starts with a B that just as accurately defines what a<b>  woman</b> is being when she is \"bossy\". This is an example of individual adversity. You as a person, man o<b> r woma</b>n, must struggle through adversity to ultimately climb the latter to better your career and to shape the person you dream to become. The video \"Ban Bossy\" contradicts itself because all these women testifying being called bossy are actual women who ARE successful.\n\nAnd if it's meant to empower women then why not focus on the individuality aspect of the campaign rather than the collective. Women are their own worst enemy, it's not the job for men to stroke their self-esteem, it's women who have to put more effort to praise women intelligence in the media, which you rarely see, and frankly I doubt we will ever see in the near future. Women need to fight through the stereotypes rather trying to arbiter what is appropriate to say or play the victim game.\n\nSo what I am trying to say is: it's just a shirt man, get over it.",

Do you think he's trying to exert the male dominance in wearing that shirt or do you think he thought his shirt was sick and he loves it? Do you think that everyone who is annoyed at people criticizing his shirt just feel threatened by the fact that someone is taking away their tool of sexist dominance or do you think that they are angry that someone who they consider a great man is being attacked for wearing a shirt he thought was neat?\n\nI believe that the reason there aren't as many women in STEM fields is basically that graduate STEM degrees are pursued by nerds (not in a denigrating sense). STEM fields isn't sexist or culturally acceptable shirts, it is grueling hours examining logic circuits, memorizing Bayenesian statistics and quantum thermodynamics. It is wave probability equations and arrow pushing chemical reactions. It is nerds who pursue these fields and, I believe, there are a lot more male nerds than female nerds (look up any typical 'nerd' activity, be it Magic: The Gathering tournaments, DOTA 2 International attendance, robot hobbyists etc... you will find that the<b>  gender</b> ratios are skewed). I'm a graduate student in a science field and I'm a huge nerd and so is everyone else (men and women).\n\nWhy are there more men nerds than women nerds is a completely different question and definitely deserves examination (who knows, there may b<b> e sexis</b>m in the roots of it). STEM fields aren't about machismo, aggressiveness and assertiveness or a male culture (some report investment bankers are this way). STEM fields are about nerds studying nerdy things.",

Pinup art is and has mostly been made by women anyway, so I find it absurd that somehow women would be exploiting themselves, and I'm not a bit surprised that the author of the shirt is a pinup model. Sexualized women do not exploitation of women's sexuality make. To get a feel for it, I asked my female friends what they thought of the pattern on the shirt, and they didn't mind. One of them even said it would look good on a dress before I even explained to her the situation. The only one who thought it was sexist was my feminist friend. So, far as I can gather the shirt isn't offensive to women, just some feminists who don't like the aesthetics of scantily clad women.\nPerhaps Dr Taylor's shirt was inappropriate, but there is <b> nothing </b>wrong with embracing human sexuality such as the babes o nthe shirt. Had they not made such a big deal out of this I'd find the shirt quirky much in how Richard Feynman wore Hawaiian shirts. While oversexualizing women in the media is a problem and I would like to see less of it, if this shirt in particular offends someone's sensibilities I think they're a prude.",

I belive that in an alternative universe where women would be as respected as men, a shirt like this would not have been problematic and hurtful, but unfortunately <b> sexism </b>is still alive and going strong. And why do I think that Kim Kardashian posing naked isn't a problem? because it's on her own terms! She has every right to present herself sexually, just as men do, I just wish that society could appreciate women's body/beauty without questioning them as valuable human-beings,Seeing women being<b>  sexual</b> isn't a problem itself, the problem is that some men have trouble comprehending that <b> a woma</b>n can be more than that. And considering how man created and upho<b> ld patriarc</b>hy and benefit from it strongly, they have no right to sexualize us further contributing to our oppression.\u00a0\n(I'd like to point out that english isn't my native language so this may not be on point at all)",

            "commentText": "I think the main difference between your side and the anti-SJW side (stripping away all the emotion) is that SJWs treat people unequally based on their <b> race,</b><b>  gender</b>, and sexuality while the anti-SJW side mostly just wants everyone to be treated equally.\n\nThe point that anti-SJWs try to make in regards to this shirt and many other issues is that if you are allowed to criticize a man for his tasteless shirt, then you should also be allowed to criticize <b> a woma</b>n for her, let's say, overly sexy clothing.\n\nOr that if you are allowed to criticize someone for being white (I've lost count of how many anti- #gamergate \u00a0people I've seen on twitter calling for white men to be genocided) then it should also be okay to criticize someone for bei<b> ng bla</b>ck.\n\nObviously criticizing blacks for the color of their skin is verbotten and rightly so. And obviously criticizing women for wearing stuff that's too sexy is verbotten and rightly so. What the anti-SJW side is protesting is the hypocrisy. It's sort of like \"Okay, I agreed to treat everyone equally and I'm doing my best at it and it seems to be working and life seems to be better, but, what the hell, now you are attacking me because of<b>  my r</b><b> ace, ge</b>nder, and sexuality? WTF?\"\n\nThe whole idea behind the SJW mentality appears to be a mix of intersectiona<b> lity, patri</b>archy theory, and the hierarchy of oppression. While the anti-SJW side is about treating everyone equally.\n\nFeminism seems to have this vocal minority with an SJW mentality, which is why we're seeing a lot of anti-feminists and men's rights advocates pop out of the woodwork. Anti-feminism is a reaction to this SJW stuff. It's basically saying \"I don't want special privileges for women due to<b>  their </b>gender. I want equality and equal treatment for everyone.\"\n\n #shirtgate \u00a0has spawned a lot of parodies and, for me, by far the most poignant one was a picture of naked angry feminists protesting something or other with the title \"empowerment\" and that same picture on a shirt with the title \"oppression\". I discussed this image with a feminist. She claimed that the shirt, when worn by a man, would objectify the women on the picture. So I asked her what if Kim Kardashian sold t-shirts with a photo of her butt. She claimed it would be empowering, because it's her decision and she can consent to this. So I asked what if Kim Kardashian drew a picture of her butt and sold that on a t-shirt. Same thing. Empowering. So I pointed out that the person who designed Matt Taylor's shir<b> t was </b>a woman. That was two days ago. No response.\n\nIn the long term what I personally fear is that if we allow this hypocrisy of some genders and races being okay to mock and criticize, but others not, for the same exact thing, then this same logic will be carried over to other field<b> s. E.g</b>. \"black people commit a disproportionate amount of crimes, therefore we must be prejudiced towards them.\" I don't want that. I want to treat everyone equally. Not based on some hierarchy of oppression.",

I have to say, though, it seems to me that the \"anti-SJW\" movement fears something that's largely imaginary, this \"some genders and races being okay to mock and criticize, but others not\" thing you're talking about. Criticism based on <b> race,</b><b>  gender</b><b> , sexua</b>l orientation is never OK, and I rarely hear it from feminists I know or read or see. If I did hear someone calling for \"white men to be genocided,\" what do you think I'd say? We all want people to be treated equally, but that is a /very complex/ thing to figure. It begins with understanding that we can't just start with today, we have to take into account the history of oppression, how certain groups got here at the expense of others. This is the idea behind, for example, affirmative action. Like it or not, we inherit the responsibilities of our parents and their parents. I think our time is best spent trying to learn what that history is.",

                    "commentText": "If we're looking at the history of oppression, then we have to look at it with way more granularity than just the color of the skin. For example, I'm Estonian. Our people were first mentioned in an Ancient Roman scroll and starting with the earliest crusades, we were ruled by Germans, Danes, Swedes, and finally Russians. Under all these rulers we were slaves, for more than 700 years. If my memory serves me right, Estonians did not gain basic rights under Tsarist rule until a few years after the abolishment of slavery in the USA. It wasn't until the chaos at the end of WW1 that we finally declared independence, until uncle Stalin decided to grab our territory for himself. Our country did not exist again until 1991. Should I be angry at Germans, Danes, Swedes, or Russians? Should I bear some sort of ill will towards Slavic people in general? Should we ask for reparations? Would it make any sense to go up to a visiting Russian tourist and tell him to check his privilege?\n\nNone of these options make any sense to me. Affirmative action i.e. discriminating against those whose grandparents discriminated against my grandparents does not make sense to me. If an <b> ethnic </b>Russian wants to work at my company, I'm not going to tell him to go away just because his grandfather was in the<b>  Re<b> d</b</b>> Army where he invaded and occupied my people, probably killing a few of my countrymen along the way. I'm not going to treat an Austrian differently just because the legendary baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg tried to personally murder my great-great-grandfather for the crime of teaching reading and writing to his fellow Estonians.\n\nIf we continue this contest of who has been oppressed the most, then we're not going to get anywhere. We have far more <b> in comm</b>on with each other than we think. Focusing on our differences and on whose great grandparents were oppressed the most is simply going to perpetuate the cycle of anger, hatred, and violence. There will always be nutcases on all sides who take things too far and I've already seen way too many nutcases on the SJW side. Because any time you start lumping people into groups and start privileging one group over another, based on whatever criteria, you're going to see nutcases living out th<b> eir rac</b>ist and sexist fantasies to the extreme.\n\nBut, hey, if we are going to compete on who has been oppressed the most, then I'm pretty sure I'm gonna win. Because, arguably, in the context of being oppressed by other groups base<b> d on ethni</b>city, Estonians have had it worse and for far longer than<b>  even </b>black slaves in USA. Hard to compete with 700+ years of slavery, including the local lord's right to deflower virgin daughters of his subjects.",

That, when it comes to science,<b>  gender</b> should not have an impact on your credibility.\nI think that there is still some \"lag\" when it comes to the evolution of sociological matters. The new generations, who grow up with the internet that teaches them to be critical about everything may have a lot of different views about this, but they are challenged to think about it when confronted with these issues, which i think is a important first step for a change to the better.\nOlder folks(40+), i dont want to generalize, may have more of an average subconcious\u00a0misogynistic tendency which is reflected in the data that you presented.\nBut i think that while the female sience community is growing, these views will change over time and tumble the views that were normal 50 years ago. Or at least i hope so.\n\nStill to reflect all these issues on one guy wearing a t-shirt, is wrong. He may not have thought about it that way as there was no nudity on it and judging from his tatoos ect. i guess he is just used to this kind of art style and may not have looked at it from that perspective. Especially as it was a birthday gift from a female friend of his.\nI think his laid-back character, got into the way of him and caused something that he didn't expect. But to\u00a0denounce him as the reason why females have a weaker postion in the sience community is wrong, but also shows from the reactions that we still have just another sociological issue to takle.",

(And to protect against Ad Hominems: I am a 15 year <b> old </b<b> >black</b> male)\n\n\nFrom what I've gleaned,\n\nFeminism is based on the belief that women and \"minorities\" are automatically institutionally oppressed by all facets of society, regardless of individual situation. No matter how many examples that seem to prove the opposite in most of the western world, any anecdote of individual discrimination (fabricated or legitimate) mixed with the social coercion described in the above video.effectively silences all who point to the evidence of the contrary.\n\nI am a staunchly anti-authoritarian liberal. I believe in the values of of individualism and freedom (the ability to do anything as long as it doesn't harm others), in other words, classical liberalism. I don't think that any of the harms that feminists bring up (x-shaming, \"rape culture\", objectification, hurting others' feelings) warrants the limitation of the rights of others in society. But that's exactly what feminists fight for. \n\nThey want a reversal of the presumption of innocence in cases of rape an<b> d sexua</b>l assault, they want to restrict \"offensive\" speech, they seek to discriminate against innocent \"privileged\" people to correct \"historical wrongs\". \n\nIn essence, they wish to dismantle equality of opportunity in favor of equality of outcome.\n\nThey seek power. The power to enact these measures. And the capitulation of the establishment who are meant to act as sentries of our personal rights deeply frightens me. They use western culture's bias towards change and righting perceived wrongs against the interests of freedom. Through this political and social extortion, the freedoms of the dissenting are slowly eroded day by day.\n\nAnd one day, without sound or fury, those freedoms vanish.",

You make a number of assumptions and take as a given what amount to ideological assertions that have little real evidence to support them. For example, if we're going to use the word \"exploitative\" in regards to the use of feminine imagery in the media then who, really is being exploited? The well paid and status accruing model? Or the viewers of that material? Other women that respond out of a competitive drive for the social power that comes with attractiveness? Or, perhaps, the men, who, like baby birds that instinctively react to the <b> colored </b>markings on their mother's beak, that have an involuntary response to specific stimuli, who, subsequently, may then be sucked into buying certain products because they've been associated with indicators that signal the availability of a very healthy and fertile female? \n\nOr, for example, you completely ignore the disparity between men and women in University degrees being earned and focus on what? The CHOICE women make to go into fields other than STEM. Worse, this seems to be predicated on the idea that, without external influence, men and women would choose to go into STEM fields at the same rates. You point out that assumptions of the reverse may be due to cultural biases. Certainly, that's very possible. However, so, too, may your apparent assumption that this is not the case. \n\nI realize this is an<b>  old</b> video and a<b> n ol</b>d thread and these points have probably been covered elsewhere here but, just in case they haven't, here's my take.

This isn't to say men are more intelligent, just that men and women have different strengths.  Our brains are even constructed differently.\nAlso, I cannot stand when the regressive left (extreme liberals) call all men sexist and women the victims.  All you have to do is look at the statistics as a whole, and not those affecting women to see that men face just as many issues as women in society, and are actually discriminated against by law, whereas women aren't.\nI do not believe we live in a sexist, misogynystic society at all.",

To require them to think about their actions and their inactions, may feel incredibly annoying.\n\nThat's what it feels to take someone's pleasure away, a pleasure that is so normalised, so baked into our lives, it's removal feels a lot like pain.\n\nI, for one, think that it's possible to hold two lines of thought in mind at once; to marvel at the unbelievable magic of the suffragettes movements, and to lament the real contribution, however small, of one woman's lamentation at one man's fashion choice at a community of scientists, who began at a loss.",

You're never going to get complete equality of opportunity because people have different talents and abilities.  But, I think that an optimized equality of opportunity would be highly desirable.  I think that more social democratic countries have way more equality of opportunity than the United States which I would describe as a socialist plutocracy.  I would also say that a traditional caste system would have much less equality of opportunity, and that the United States in its chattel-slave economy past had much less equality of opportunity than it has in the present day.  In fact I would argue that you cannot hope to achieve any sort of reasonable equality of opportunity while ignoring historical relationships between different groups of people.  For example, when slavery was ended in the United States was equality of opportunity reached between blacks and whites?",

You make an emotional argument very well, but the truth of the matter is men are sexualized also, and that women simply have no interest in career fields like science, construction, and politics. However, what is sexist is that a women wanting a job in the sciences will be hired immediately first even if a man that was more qualified had applied. Blacks get 230 extra points on the SAT and Asians get subtracted 50. The United States has shifted from being about fulfilling character to fulfilling quotas.

After all if there is a chance your husband will hit you if you irritate him by telling him you are unhappy (and you are 100% financially dependent on him) you aren't going to admit you're unhappy are you? There is tons of research showing the less autonomy women have over their lives the more they lie to appease men.\n\nBTW men are 4-times more likely to be psychotic than women and diagnoses of psychosis have increased enormously over the past 40 years, same for autism. So maybe you should be worrying about what is making men go <b> psycho.</b>\n\nPS It is interesting that you seem to be offended by my username, that is some deep-seated insecurity/paranoia if you think a username is a threat to you... something I have noticed in only the most extreme misogynists/racists I've encountered on Youtube.",

I answered your question, which to me was nearly impossible seeing as I had never purported that men actively say \"I hate women, I want to oppress them.\"\n\nI feel that you have no interest in seeing things from any other perspective. I've fallen into your little rhetoric traps (I.e. Defending myself against your inferences)... I made my argument in my original response, which, isn't too hard to find considering that it's just US and that other guy here since. \n\nI wondered how you got to asking jovan why he was so hateful, and in doing so, I opened the door for you to put ALL of his stances onto my name...I said you can't know someone's character from some YouTube comments, and you asked if I thought all men across all ages hate women...I said I can't speak for anyone else, but determined it felt IMPOSSIBLE to say \"yes,\" which, isn't good enough for you?\n\nI said if all civilizations have crumbled, and all civilizations were patriarchal, then MAYBE that's NOT the best way???\n\nYou asked me to prove something about double standards of beauty and sexuality... You should also have to prove it wrong, but... Men being allowed to be freely <b> sexual </b>while women need be virginal is harmful to BOTH sexes.<b>  Sex</b> is emotional, and both genders should approach it carefully. But making women pretend they don't have a special appetite is dangerous, it's ,as you like to say, a \"natural thing,\" and going against is, I believe, creates a dissonance that is harmful. You are right, tho. There are no double standards in nature...Women shouldn't have to wear makeup, it's unnatural. (Addressed because I believe if beauty standards and such didn't exist, the workplace would be less hostile towards women. Not all women WANT to be home makers)\n\nDo you suggest MEN give women their \"role?\" What IS that role, you're YET to say, unless I missed it WAY earlier in the thread...\n\nGoing to reiterate that I DON'T believe that most men HATE women, and you saying that THAT is my mindset is erroneous. \n\nThe post article addresses being conservative, but does NOT identify what they mean by that. I think that extreme liberalism or extreme \"conservativeness\" are harmful. I never said women SHOULDN'T be somewhat conservative. I believe i<b> n gende</b>r roles, I simply think that if<b>  a wom</b>an wanted a job add a cancer researcher, she should be allowed to have it, and NOT be hassled in the workplace, or looked at as a \"guaranteed failure,\" as many men believ<b> e a wo</b>man in a STEM position will be. \n\nHowever....And this related to the article about Dutch women...I think EVERYONE should work part time. If women were happier in the 50's when they had a good husband and weren't a part of <b> the \"</b>race to the top<b> \" rat</b> race one should HARDLY be surprised. I think the goal of modern life, to accumulate wealth to receive power, respect, and happiness, is causing depression. \n\nYou mashed up my words about equality. I said, very CLEARLY, that I meant equal in terms of expectations to fulfill their role, regardless of what they believe their role is. Saying \"NO you can't do that, it's not the right role for you,\" will be harmful, ESPECIALLY if you're RIGHT and your mandate pushes a person further to prove you wrong and makes them stay longer in their false, non fulfilling role. \n\nI've never once said women were the same as men, I've rejected no reality. I have not indicated my belief that workplace success (presuming you mean that by \"success?\") makes women happier, so I am not attempting to counter that assurance....more of your projecting... \n\nYour meet of truth is true for EVERYONE! Less demands, more leisure time/time to do fulfilling work = more happiness....No shit, detective...\n\nAnswer MY question, what is the \"role\" for women, and where does that role come from??",

It felt like you were trying to cause some sort of guilty emotional response in me rather than bringing an actual argument to the table, because you never really elaborate on this point you deem so crucial. Also, your bringing up of statistics really make me cringe. They can be so easily manipulated that simply bringing them up isn't helping your argument in any way. I would've liked further elaboration on that as well. I must agree with the mayor of London, just because something offends someone, something so meaningless and almost non-existent as a man's preference in shirts, doesn't mean there isn't room for it in this world. I think the problem with a lot of people nowadays isn't that they're sexist <b> pigs,</b> but that they are overly sensitive and self-entitled in the most disgusting of ways. It comes off as spoiled and whiny, like they can't deal with the reality that not everything is going to please them and their ideals.

Does this mean men are discriminated against? \n\nThe reason to push more women into STEM fields goes something like this: young girls just haven't grown up enough to reach the needed level of proficiency with maths by the time they have to make a choice of university and take the entrance exams, so you push more girls to take STEM courses in the hope that they will eventually develop interest and talent into them. Or, in other words, boys' math proficiency peaks earlier than girls' math proficiency. \n\nNote how this is not about cultural norms.",

It should be mentioned that that pleasure comes at the cost of everyone else's pleasure - women, POC, <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>people<b> , disable</b>d people. I'm<b>  a wom</b>an in science - I'm studying to be a medical doctor - and that shirt didn't anger me so much as it depressed me. I was incredibly excited about the rosetta landing, but that shirt made it obvious to me that despite my interest in the sciences, and my having loved astronomy as a hobby since childhood, this man viewed me in the same way as <b> the </b>old men who would feel me up on the subway when I was 14. My interest and passion in the subject m<b> eans not</b>hing to people who only see women as objects to be consumed. It's important to remember that the reaction to the shirt isn't just a reaction to the one instance, but the lifetime of instances of people telling women that they aren't good enough, that they are only worth how attractive men find them. I believe this constitutes a systematic denial of 'pleasure' for women and other marginalised people, who constantly have to work against society in order to achieve their goals and to stay safe. For example, I would love to travel alone, but I cannot due to the high chances of being rap<b> ed. A </b>black person would love to be able to call the police without being afraid for their own lives. This 'pleasure' that white straight men get out of bigotry comes from a denial of the pleasure of so many others, and It's important to recognise that, especially when pointing out why so many people are hesitant to let that go.\nI just finished a fantastic book on <b> global </b>sexism called 'half the sky'. It's a tough read but hopeful and incredibly pragmatic and largely free from dissertation-level doublespeak, which works in its favour. Check it out:\u00a0 [LINK] ",

You've done a great job at helping me look at things from a different perspective.\nHate that this is the first time I'm posting on your channel but I've spent the entire day reading about several cultural occurrences very similar to this one and you uploading this today leads me feeling that I need to say this: I was entirely on board until around 3:05. This line of argument is what I find most annoying about these discussions. To keep in theme with your video- I feel like I'm in danger of not getting to have an opinion.\n\nWhen you bring up privilege or the <b> patriarchy </b>(both things that, I admit, do exist in our culture in one way or another) a card is being played that effectively invalidates anything I have to say. By saying I'm so entrenched in the<b>  patriarchy</b> and entitlement that I'm not even aware of my own actions not only belittles my opinion but effectively removes me from the conversation entirely. I must bow out of any discussion or else I am somehow supporting th<b> e patriarch</b>y and/or abusing my privilege. Have I been on the receiving end of some advantages that have not been made available to others? Probably. Should this mean that I don't get to have an opinion or even have the ability to engage in a debate in regards to anything involvi<b> ng gend</b>er<b>  or r</b>ace? I certainly hope not. Even if I am in fact speaking from a privileged position.\u00a0\nI personally would not wear that man's shirt nor would I ever want to purchase something like it. That shi<b> t is t</b>acky. But if it's how he chooses to express or identify himself- then I believe he does not deserve to be shamed for this. And effectively that is what's happening- maybe not a crucifixion but it is certainly attempted character assassination. We both know that there is a difference be<b> tween s</b>exi<b> sm and mi</b>sogyny but the general public doesn't. And labeling someone's attire or attitude as sexist places that person with some pretty unscrupulous company.\nSo I can understand why people would be offended by X and I can understand why people would fight against X. But what I can't understand is why if I disagree with your stance then I must also defend ALL oppression of women and/or non-white people.\n\nAny way, thanks for looking at all these comments. As I'm sure you're aware- you've opened a pretty big can of worms. Best of luck getting through it all...and keep up the good work.",

This is undoubtedly true, however due to the ages of the people involved, it will be a long time for the statistics to change due to how out of proportion they've been. If you look at younger <b> age </b>groups within large Stem companies, women are a much higher percentage of people. The point I'm making is that it takes awhile for the efforts of today to show themselves in percentages of the scale, and using it as a indicator isn't particularly helpful. I'd be more interested to know about 20-30 year olds, and what the percentages are there, and perhaps how it's changed. I think there's a real discussion that's interesting and fulfilling along the lines of women in Stem. I see in companies that are global that even the region can really dictate how these percentages work out. Clearly different biases and social pressures are occurring in each place which is interesting to consider. I think having a dispassionate discussion as opposed to an enflamed passionate one is where we can find value. - When it comes to the shirt, it's in poor taste, but it doesn't speak to a broader issue in my mind, it speaks to one individual's poor decision making. No company would allow them to wear that shirt in the workplace, and that speaks volumes for the fact this isn't even allowed in \"Stem\" fields. It feels like everyone else is having a discussion that is very distant from the workplace. Perhaps I'm wrong, and biased by working in a professional environment.",

            "commentText": "I am having a lot of difficulty with this. We often focus on only one type of objectification when we talk about it - the <b> sexual </b>objectification of women. Unfortunately, this is not the only type of objectification that exists. For example, I would argue that a man wearing a nice suit and watch in an ad could be financially objectified (and this could also be<b>  sexual</b>, depending on what a person finds attractive). We also choose to objectify ourselves at times, and this is not necessarily a bad thing, as I'm sure a model's bank account will indicate. But the point of speaking out against it is that objectification treats people as only having one defining characteristic that makes them desirable, and not a fully-developed human, as they truly are. It is bad because it takes away the agency of that person, unwillingly. (There is a interesting side note here about campaigning against judging women by how they dress, but not standing by that campaign for a male).\n\nThe question then becomes this: is a scantily cla<b> d woma</b>n inherent<b> ly sexu</b>al? and if there is some kind of image of t<b> hat wo</b>man, is it inherently objectification? At this point we start getting into the messy grey area of motivations and intent, and whether or not those matter when someone else is offended. And, to a lesser extent, how people allow themselves to react and behave when offended.\n\nThis is where I think that it mak<b> es a transi</b>tion into the subject of women in STEM fields. If we are going to ask, \"Is this shirt indicative of an attitude in STEM fields?\" then we first must figure out what the shirt indicates. I don't think many people paused to ask that question. I cannot say whether or not women are kept out of STEM research by one method or another, but I do not think that this shirt is an indicator of any particular culture than his tattoos might be.\n\nThe point is this- we must broaden our definitions of objectification, and realize that it is something we all do, on a regular basis. This will help us identify and tackle the seriously detrimental objectification (and be rightfully offended and reactionary), while leaning to let the lesser, non-detrimental act that we all do just fade away into a bri<b> ghtly co</b>lored, obno<b> xious,</b> tacky background.",

Worth a read for anyone scrolling through these comments.\u00a0\n\n\"We first must figure out what the shirt indicates.\" An interesting thought experiment might be to ask: How would you feel about the shirt if it was full of totally nude women? Or just one giant nude <b> woman </b>across the front? Would it still just be obnoxious and<b>  tacky</b>? Or would you say it's disrespectful to women to wear that on a day when you know you'll be on a webcast watched by thousands of women and girls? Would it be disrespectful to men if you had naked men on a shirt and wore it in the same circumstances? I think it would be disrespectful in both circumstances. But it feels a little funny to ask about the naked men, right? I think that feeling tells us something important. It tells us these things don't exist in a vacuum. Like it or not, women have experienced real, unforgivable, often silent oppression for a very long time. It doesn't just go away, it's systematized in our culture.\n\nSo I think that, though the women are not nude on Taylor's shirt, the effect of scantily clad women is not much different. It indicates a similar thing, that this is a boy's club. Not by itself, but along with the many other things that act as puzzle pieces to make that larger message. Maybe you disagree, and I wouldn't hold it against you, as I can see you've really thought about this. To quote you: \"I am having a lot of difficulty with this.\" These are subtle things we're talking about.",

                    "commentText": "Nudity and FCC regulations aside, we're still making a fundamental assumption here: visual depiction of certain areas women's skin is, by nature, inherently (a) <b> sexual </b>and (b) objectification (which is assumed to be bad). I'm not saying this shirt wasn't<b>  sexual</b>, and I'm unclear on whether or not it objectifies women, as this is a fairly poorly defined concept (are these real women depicted? what if it was wonde<b> r woma</b>n?). But that's my point - vast assumptions about a nebulous topic. My point here is that we should probably have the same attitude in social situations as judicial. We usually call it the benefit of the doubt. (It should be worth noting I'm not really defending the shirt here, but rather the idea that we can determine all of these things from one action and somehow use it to shape our view of not only academia but also society)\n\nI have a hard time agreeing with the idea that this shirt is an indicator of general sentiment in STEM fields, with relation to both fashion and women. I would be tempted to ask why it is that women are under-represented in STEM fields when women have also done overwhelmingly well in other fields. Certainly the concept of a boy's club (or another kind of restriction) would be an easy, and viable answer. Even though it may have merit, I think it is a lazy answer, and is too quick to pin the problem on an external force. As noted by other commenters, t<b> he a</b>ge of the sample group it quite telling. Simply looking at the end result (or progress thus far) cannot indicate equality of opportunity, nor lack thereof. If this were the case, we can conclude that nursing is a \"girl's club\" and excludes men. Is it?\n\nIt actually doesn't feel funny to ask about men, at least for me. You're right that society rarely does, though. But I'd be willing to bet that if he was wearing a shirt with objectified men on it, there would be more outcry that it harms women than men because of it's aggressive take on male sexuality.",

Will it not discourage many more to do any actual work in the STEM field if your choice in fashion vastly outweighs you scientific achievements? Also, as you got in on in the video, if we compare how much attention the act of landing something on an asteroid got to how much attention the \"break the internet\" thing got. As before, it seems to me like scientific achievements are fairly forgotten in the most popular corners of the internet and in mass media. \"Break the internet\" will probably not be featured in any serious newspapers but we are still bombarded with the latest gossip and fashion tips there instead of anything with any scientific value whatsoever. Granted, there are magazines devoted to science but those are not the ones that are read by a majority of the population. I believe that is a much larger problem and sends a lot more signals than Dr. Matt Taylors shirt did.\n\nTL;DR; I believe that the fact that mass media and the most popular corners of the internet favor fashion, gossip and \"reality\"-tv over science, is much more detrimental to science and all related fields of work\u00a0than any shirt Dr Taylor could possibly have worn.",

Plus im sure that anyone seriois about a stem job isnt going to be put off by a guys shirt considering the fact that the jobs themselves are hard to do. Im not saying no women want to do the job but we are a sexually dimorphic species. Women and men will have different interests in jobs. Those that are discouraged by this shirt (which i doubt anyone was) would just as easily be discouraged by the workload or any other factors that dont make it easy for them to do the jobs. Stem jobs are more suited, in a purely physiological way, to human men anf to blame other factors for the employment numbers is to ignore this fact. On the same way you dont see as many men in the care industry. Noones rallying to get men into female dominated jobs because most men dont want those jobs on a purely chemical level.",

There are a lot of people out there who like to get offended for the sake of being offended I guess.\nEDIT: On the other hand I admit that women are discriminated in these fields, but going all out over a shirt is just too much.",

Showing a billion different examples of how American culture objectifies women and how these people should stop contributing to this culture when you wear a shirt, show an ad of scantily clad women, Kim Kardashian shows her ass, etc. Or empowering our children and women to be aware of this cultural pattern and teach them that you can tell the establishment to fuck off by becoming the first female president as one example.

I agree that yea, it was inappropriate, but it did not warrant the degree of criticism, or more specifically, the reactions it garnered. The internet has become a giant hive mind. I do not believe at all that most people who've come to criticize Dr. Taylor on the tweets or whatnot  fully thought about the problem, not as much as you have. Not everyone, especially on the internet, approaches problems in an academic sense. It was pure and simple mob attack by an inquisition of social justice warriors on the internet despite on whether their side was right or not.\nIf the whole internet cared that deeply about the subject of <b> sexism,</b> as they seemed to have been in the case of Dr. Taylor, then they would be up in arms against every misogynistic imagery in Hollywood, mainstream media, etc. and even in their own background, the internet. We would have seen the same degree of reaction, but we haven't.\n\nIt's clear to me then that this particular instance has only come to this point simply because it's gotten a lot of coverage and exposure, and everyone decided to mindlessly jump into the scene",

I think it would be degrading if people saw women as purely <b> sexual </b>objects, and I can see how many people could misinterpret that shirt as enforcing that cultural standard. But I think we're looking in the wrong place, I don't think the problem lies in that action. The problem lies in the fact that people THINK this is degrading. Why is wearing a shirt with a<b>  woman</b> showing off her body degrading? If <b> a woma</b>n actually wanted to do that, then I say go ahead, they are allowed to make their own choices. There's this belief that being very open with your body or sexuality is \"bad\" for women, and in my opinion, we should work to destroy that notion. It's okay to work in a STEM field if you want, it's also okay to be a pornstar if you want, it's also okay to be a musician, or whatever you want to do with your life. But enforcing the idea that<b>  a wom</b>an showing off her body is shameful will ultimately make close-minded individuals who will also end up thinking that showing off your body is degrading. I <b> say wo</b>man should have free choice deciding on what they want to be, and that this shirt isn't degrading because if some people want to be strippers<b> , or</b> sex-workers, or pornstars, or models, and show off their body then that is okay. I think the mindse<b> t of \"</b>woman are only go<b> od f</b>or sex\" is disgusting, but I don't think the way to solve it is to label something like that is degrading.

If a<b>  woman</b>'s ambition for a STEM career is put off by a man wearing a shirt with sexy ladies on it, then she was never than passionate about STEM to begin with, or simply has <b> a menta</b>l health issues (se<b> xy wom</b>an phobia).\n\n3. You assert that sexy women is denigrating and exploitative of women, and that it asserts male dominance over women. The reality is that women who dress alluringly and provocatively (like the women on his shirt) are asserting th<b> eir sex</b>ual power over men, as well as other women.\n\n4. To claim that images of sexy women is denigrating women is ITSELF denigrating women.\n\n4. Every day millions of women exploit men's hard wired attraction to women's bodies, by dressing provocatively and putting on make up which mimics fe<b> male se</b>xual arousal and ovulation. This literally affects men's brains and physiology in ways men have no control over, and is thus a form of mind control over men. Therefore to frame women as the passive objects in this equation and men as the active exploiters is not only inaccurate, it is stripping the agency from women, which is itself a form of objectification of women.\n\n5. Men and women are mammal<b> s and s</b>exual objectification/ manipulation/ flirtation/ admiration/ exhibitionism is a natural component of social behaviour for adults. This is a scientific fact. Anyone working in STEM who cannot cope with basic biological realities of male and female sexuali<b> ty and </b>sexual expression is obviously not mature enough for a STEM career. \n\n6. What feminists did to Matt Taylor was despicable. They reduced him to tears in front of the whole world on what should have been the highlight of his career and his life. That was nasty, vindictive, cunty behaviour on their part.\n\n7. The hypocrisy and utter lunacy of feminism is astounding. One day they are parading topless demanding 'free the nipple' because flaunting your female sexuality and nude body is empowering to women...... and the next day they are trying to prevent women from posing topless for The Sun newspaper because  flaunting your female sexuality and nude body is degrading to women. So which is it?\n\n8. If the shirt had said \"Beyonce Official World Tour 2015<b> \" on it</b> nobody would have said it was sexist or offensive. They would say it was empowering and free expression.\n\n9. Whole science departments have had to close down after feminists cajoled young women to signup to STEM courses (pushing men out to make way for them), and then these women all dropped out during the cour<b> se to d</b>o gender studies or psychology or journalism.... which is what they wanted to do all along before being arm twisted into STEM.\n\n10. Men and women are wired differently and have different career and lifestyle ambitions and skills. It is just a fact that men are more drawn towards STEM careers. Young women especially have so much advantage when it comes to extrovert jobs which rely heavily on image, socialising, networking and 'selling yourself' .... plus young women like jobs which offer social networking so they can look for a husband before their eggs go bad, Being stuck in a lab surrounded by nerds is just not appealing for most young women.\n\n11. The main deterrent for women getting into STEM is feminists FALSELY claiming the field is full o<b> f sexist, m</b<b> >isog</b>ynist pigs. The opposite is true. Women are likely to get special treatment, especially if they are in a minority.",

Is this the NORM for THEM? Is this really what women in the field are exposed to on a regular basis? Is Matt Taylor just one of many men that have that kind of fashion sense?\u00a0It sure would be helpful if we actually asked, ya know, ACTUAL WOMEN IN STEM about what they thought about all of this...\n\nBut no, everyone's too busy participating on a baseless witchhunt against an innocent man for the sole reason of pushing their own agenda. The only thing anyone is \"threatened\" by is Female Sexuality. That's the most <b> common </b>cause behind all of these \"You Blew That Way Outta Proportion\" thinkpieces that clutter far too many terrible clickbait blogsites.\n\nAny female body that shows more than an \"acceptable\" amount of skin is immediately slut-shammed, and any male that may take a fancy in said female is deemed to be some deep-rooted sexist that should feel ashamed for it. For whatever reason society seems to be slipping back into this Puritan Virgin/Whore, Saint/Sexist paradigm, and all that's going to encourage people to do is try and police/restrict free thought and expression. To form an angry mob and demand he conforms to what THEY find suitable because some people had their \"feelings\" hurt about it. Ignoring the fact that that alone gives the finger intellectualism (mah feels > logic and reasoning, apparently), but that goes against the entire idea behind art to BEGIN with. To use an Eriq La Salle quote: \"Art should offend people because it should challenge people.\" Art SHOULDN'T be made just to appease every little Special<b>  Snowflake</b> out there, and this guy's T-shirt should be no different. Sam Pepper committed an ACTUAL CRIME so HE should be expected to apologize. Matt Taylor should not have been been needlessly slandered in order to get one out of him for exercising his right as an American citizen to express himself the way he chose to.\u00a0\n\nIt doesn't matter if people weren't offended? Well it doesn't matter if people WERE offended, either. Freedom of expression means that you aren't going to agree with SOME people's expression. If you feel like presenting logical/reasonable arguments to PERSUADE them to your line of thinking, that's fine, but rallying up an Internet mob to bully people until they submit to your line of thinking is where I draw the line and where you yourself are killing free expression. You might as well hand out handbooks on how we're all \"supposed\" to act so no one will ever get offended again. I mean it's not like thinking like a hivemind would bring annnny negative consequences to society or anything.",

But honestly, their counter argument might sound like this, \"Cause Kim is a product of a society that has taught her that her body is the only valuable thing she has, so she unknowingly does this, cause it's the only thing she thinks gives her value.\"\u00a0\n\n\nBasically saying Kim, due to society, can't have power, agency, or control over her life, but yet again, is a victim, like every other<b>  woman</b>, and incapable of true free will. Now maybe there's a little bit of truth in that, but holy shit, they are now just trying to replace religion in saying what people can and can not do, which religion has been doing for thousands of years to us. They are still bossing people around, telling them what they can/can't wear, show, say, write, and behave, just like it has always been. This is not progressive in my mind, this is archaic, and this is ironically sexist. In fact, in the past, women weren't allowed to show much, and in parts of the world today, they still aren't. Maybe some parts of feminism aren't so pro women after all. \"\u00a0Satan\u00a0disguises himself as an\u00a0angel of light\" and yeah, kinda funny using a bible quote.",

It's natural human nature to judge a personal on there looks before engaging with them even if we don't want it to do it. Many are objectified as a job and not necessarily a job about there looks to do with looks, like a sports player is an asset for there physical attributes. Even when it is about there looks like when a model will objectify themselves as a walking mannequin and that isn't sexist, he/she serves the purpose of showing off the cloths.\n\nThe harm in objectification is when some-one who doesn't what to be, is, when a normal person is stripped down to their looks even while trying to present what he/she is as a person. For example a sexist boss hiring a person because he/she thinks that person is hot and wants them in the office, but not because of the person qualification for the position.\n\nThis shirt though isn't sexist. The <b> woman </b>on it (which I think is the<b>  woman</b> who made it) isn't trying to present her personality or who she is, shes presenting her human form as beautiful an<b> d sexua</b>l. No-one is being wrongly presented and hurt by it so no-one is sexist.\n\nThis next bit is my perspective form a STEM centered town could be different based on someone else's personal experience.\n\nYour telling me that a shirt is important enough to make<b>  a wom</b>an not want to join stem, that is a bit ridiculous. I that is her passion this one guy's shirt has no effect. There is no stereotype<b>  of sex</b>ism in STEM I have ever heard about. they're just is more men in STEM. The reason for there being less women is I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT A GOD. I have never heard that STEM is sexist till now. I know a lot of people in STEM.\n\nThere is no barrier to entry for women at least where I am (A very STEM centered town, mostly engineering). In my former high school less of the women chose to be in engineering I don't know why I am not them (though about equal amounts in AP science, anecdote doesn't prove much proof). The women who were there didn't care that there where more men. We where people in a STEM class not men and women. Everyone was there because interested in the topic.\u00a0\n\nIf you made it this far, sorry about the grammar, dyslexic is my bad excuse.\n\nLET THE PARAGRAPH COMMENTING COMMENCE",

However, there is a difference in how male/female sexuality is represented and used in media, and more-often-than-not female sexuality is shown as \"something to be gained\" while male sexuality is typically shown as \"something to aspire to\". Both generally cater to the male gaze, but one is for the sake of possession while the other is a model for how a man should be.\n\nKim Kardashian has gone on record saying she did that photo-shoot for herself, but the images still emphasize and conflate her \"attractiveness\" as a person to her bodily features, solely; whether or not this is for parody's sake is another question entirely (because her curves are pretty much the center of media attention anyways), but it still reduces her person to body parts for our consumption. Rarely is Ryan Gosling, or other male celebrities, put in the same position (and when they are, it arguably draws attention because of how \"out of place\" it seems).\n\nAnd as was said in the video, the shirt that scientist wore merely represents the attitude of a \"boys club\" within the STEM field. The content of the shirt is problematic, certainly, but it seems like the \"time and place\" for wearing the shirt is being criticized for the most part.",

And they don't report harassment because I don't think you realize how difficult that can be. First off, it's a your word against mine scenario most of the time and<b>  nothing</b> can be proved. Second, even if you prove it, a slap on the wrist is usually all the punishment that gets dealt. Third, you have to put yourself in the spotlight as a victim, everyone will know and think about you differently. It's unfortunate and one of the problems that we need to address as society as a whole, but people do treat you differently after you've gone through that process. For most people, unless it is a more serious harassment, it's just not worth it to go through all of that. It's easier to just ignore it, and deal with it as something that \"just happens.\" It's heartbreaking but I've heard those words from so many women that I've talked to about this. \"It's OK this is just something that happens.\"\n\nIt's easy to just say be strong and don't let people harass you, but this is the problem with that- A, that is a sort of victim blaming. We shouldn't have to teach women how to deal with harassment, we should be teaching men not harass. That's a deep cultural problem that will take generations to fix, but yeah, it exists. B, people tend to view harassment as something that comes from boogeymen on the street or the scummy guy at work that everyone agrees is scummy. Truth is it comes more often from friends or colleagues that are otherwise good people. So when they cross the line it can be difficult to press charges against them. Example- You're in line for a promotion and your boss makes it obvious what he wants you to do to get it. Obviously giving in to that is no solution. If you press charges, everyone will treat you differently and it could make the whole workplace uncomfortable. So most just choose to brush it off. This sounds like a movie scenario but this kind of shit or similar happens all the time.\n\nIt would be great if reportin<b> g sexis</b>m and being strong would work in our current society, but it's really not that simple. I recommend the book Lucky by Alice Sebold if you want to learn more about how skewed against women the justice system really is when it comes to harassment, or in the case of this book, rape. And it will reveal to you better than I can in a comment what the backlash is from society and what that can do to a person. You're right in that we need to encourage women to report it and discourage backlash, but in order to actually do that will involve changing the way society views women from it's core. Not so easy.\n\nAnyway, I'm not really arguing about this in the context of just STEM. If anything STEM is a better environment than most. I'm talking more generally. It's a larger issue that affects women everywhere and filters down to include women going into STEM.",

This shows nudity is not intrinsical<b> ly sexu</b>al, and neither is revealing clothing.\n\n\nRather it is the attitude that is the issue; how we bring up children and the  gendered roles that they are told to abide to, both by the mediasphere and by their parents who don't know better.\n\n\nIf you can't accept the reason why less women are in places of authority are because of the reasons stated, what do you believe is the reason?",

Dildonik  \"that's what men evolved to do.\"  That's a disgustingly incorrect and sexist remark.\n\n\nIt is true that men are generally more physically able in many respects.  And sure, in agricultural times physical ability was relatively important, and before agriculture, hunting demanded even more crucial physical ability.\n\n\nBut in today's service sector economy there is no natural advantage to be a male worker.  There is, however, a cultural advantage, because of people like you believing that men are simply just better at working.  This is completely unfounded.\n\n\n\"The more \"equality\" women get, the more depressed they are as a whole.\"\n\n\nDo you have any reliable sources to back that up?\n\n\n\"Meanwhile, men make up only a tiny fraction of people in college (30-40%), and male jobless rates are soaring.\"\n\n\n30-40% is not a \"tiny fraction\".  And male unemployment has never been significantly lower than for women.  Anyway, this is a digression.\n\n\n\"This generation of boys growing up today will be the most oppressed class of people since the Civil Rights movement.\"\n\n\nDo me a favour; find the most intelligent person you know and tell them you think that boys are the most oppressed \"class\" of people today.  They will burst out laughing, and then a look of disgust will slowly replace the laughter when they realise you are being serious.",

Everyone is not physically attractive and unattractive in the same way, and how somebody looks tells a story. Their clothes, piercings, tattoes, hair, makeup, lack thereof, facial expressions etc. It makes us ponder their profession, lifestyle, income or personal interests. We may not know anything about these people but we still look upon them as people.\n\n\nAlso sports figures are not really objectified, they are idealized. They are not things you want to own, they are people you want to be. Women throughout a lot of media are presented as literal or metaphorical trophies for men. Watching a show like Always Sunny In Philadelphia (which I love) there are many scenes where they bring women in so they can stand there and puff out their chest and generally act as objects of <b> sexual </b>desire for the men. You're not meant to want to be some<b>  dumb</b<b> > bimb</b>o who has accomplish<b> ed nothi</b>ng other than being an object<b>  of sex</b>ual desire, and who says or <b> does not</b>hing except whatever the men happen to want them to do at any given time, you are supposed to want to have her, for a party, or for you<b> r own s</b>exual pleasure or whatever.\n\n\nThis is not to say that men are never objectified or that women are always objectified. It is just muc<b> h more </b>common for women to be objectified in this manner. Any one given photo or video objectifying women is not going to do anything on it's own. The theory is that all of them combined together colors societies perception of women into a \"trophy wife\" type of mentality, where men are the ones who accomplish everything and women are basically a reward to men.\n\n\nI don't know how much weight this theory holds, and I don't give a shit about that guys shirt or Kims photoshoot. I also don't think art should be censored based on it's moral implications, but I do think it is good for us to have a discussion about this. As a cis-gendered white male there are a lot of atrocities that could easily fly past my radar otherwise.\u00a0\n\n\nI would also say that while not irrelevant, your own experience in your community is anecdotal. It would be just as false to say all STEM communities reject women as it would be to say that all STEM communities are entirely free of sexist prejudices. Kind of like how just because my personal community of gamers welcomes women, does not mean that all gamer communities welcome women. Statistical evidence showing that female scientists are less likely to be acknowledge for their work is more compelling to me than \"but in my town we're not like that\". Although I would have to verify the study to make sure it's not a bunch of baloney.",

When Ryan Gosling has his chest out, its typically showing him as dominant, strong and in-control sexually. \n\nWomen on the other hand, are more often than not represented in more submissive, passive positions and roles. Considering that this forced submission and passivity has been the central fixture of the oppression of women for literally millennia, these representations can have the effect of \"keeping women in their place\", or ingraining the idea that women are to be taken, chosen, dominated, etc.\n\nThis is not to say that all <b> sexual </b>representations of women are objectifying or denigrating, in fact I would argue that many are empowering. Its in the subtleties though, and I think it only takes a common-sense approach to thinking critically about how these images communicate meaning to differentiate between them.",

If women are measured by their waist-to-hip ratio, they will value that over finding a prominent career--in this case, it's STEM field.  It doesn't just discourage women, but it also sends a message to men, who don't see women in the STEM field. And some people truly believe women just aren't as smart as men. \n\nHow does this matter? Women go into lower-paying careers. The pay <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>is 78 cents on the dollar because of, yes, denigration. There are less women in the STEM field, which of course means the average would make less than the average men. \n\nThe little things matter.",

It's wonderful to celebrate your body but they are invoking idolisation of something that isn't real. They've had multiple surgeries and implants and fillers and this and that. They are not real and that's the real issue that society celebrates and tries to attain things that aren't real and average men, and women themselves, hold average women at ridiculously high, unattainable standards. It IS different for women than it is for men and that's what most men don't see because they just can't understand. Not too long ago, women were property of their fathers who could be sold to their husbands. They weren't entitled to higher education, they couldn't own property or vote. Their brains were even thought of as smaller than men. They were treated and thought of <b> nothing </b>but an object for male pleasure. Embracing sexuality is great but sexualisation of women where human beings are reduced to breasts, vaginas, a hot body, a pretty face, a score etc. are harmful to women and do take away from what they can offer to society in an intellectual capacity and to appreciate them for just who they are as people.",

However, when you essentialize a women as a <b> sexual </b>object that is where the harm comes in.  There is<b>  nothing</b> wrong with bein<b> g sexua</b>l and embracing being sexy and nudity  but it does not end there in most cases. Women get the idea that their worth as a person depends on the<b> ir sexu</b>al appeal ...as if that all they have to offer. And it goes both ways, our society will objectify men as well, but historically, women are the more likely targets. And while some women may not be affected by this, the demographic that is most concerning is young girls who do not know better and are learning about the world they live in through these means. So I think the point is that there is potential for harm in self concept and in how it limits girls. Also we live is a hypocritical society where these images are everywhere and we are expected to be sexy but not 'too' sexy, or we are ridiculed and shamed (slut, h<b> oe, t</b>hot, ect)",

If we don't care about your political viewpoint then that is our business, you don't have the right to go and tell me what I can and cannot look for in a <b> woman.</b>\n\nIf I, me, me as as individual, only care about a<b>  woman</b> based on her looks, or don't want any sort of relationship with one (friendly or otherwise) outside of <b> a sexua</b>l one, then that is my business and no one elses.\n\nThere is a difference between saying \"I only care about womens looks\", and saying \"the only thing that matters is what<b>  a wom</b>an looks like\". One is a statement about ME, the other about an ent<b> ire gen</b>der.\n\nExample, lets say there is a famous football player whose real interests lay in classic ballet. Now the fact that I don't care about the fact that he does ballet, the fact that the only thing that I care about concerning this person is his football skills, in no way invalidates the rest of his existence. I am not saying a football player is all he is, or that his love for classic ballet is useless, I am only saying that MY interest are elsewhere. \nAnd if that football player defines himself through what I think about him, then that is just pathetic and weak, and he's making an object out of himself. \n\nThe exact same thing goes for women and their apparent constant need to be respected. Here is a hint, we don't respect men either, we barely notice their existence. For most people, the amount of time or energy spent \"respecting\" any single man is about as much time as is spend on acknowledging the individuality or \"personhood\" of the dude taking my order at macdonalds.\n\nYou know why we sometimes tend to care more about what an actress looks like than we care about how she acts? When we don't do the same for men?\nBecause on the scale of how much I care about certain aspects in life, the quality of actors rates no higher than a 3 out of 10.\nWhile millions of years of evolution have <b> made</b> sex and beautiful women score a solid 10/10.\n\nSo yeah, if you don't like having your physical appearance appreciated, tough luck, evolution screwed you over again, just like it did with periods. Personally, I work out every day and I fucking WISHED women would look at men the same way we looked at them, it would be a privilege.",

And when it comes down to your individual decision on what to pursue in someone - whether it be looks, <b> sex,</b> money, etc - I agree that is your prerogative. My point lies in the fact that:\n2) Everyone desires to be respected and valued for who they really are. And in order to have a real love, meaningful connection, and healthy relationship with anyone it is necessary to at least understand this. If you are not interested in someone in their totality or their own unique essence, thats fine. Sometimes we just want<b>  sex</b>, or whatever, and we all end up using people as a means to our ends at some point in our lives. My concern here would be with honesty.\n3)The real issue I have with this topic i<b> s gende</b>r portrayal in media.

                    "commentText": "@Madison Healey\nThe problem is that even the media is simply following human behavior. Why do companies use <b> sex </b>to sell products? Because it works.\n\nThe same freedoms that apply to my actions also apply to theirs, and are in a way a reflection of my own. I am free to want what I want, and they are free to oblige, anything else would be tyranny. It would be the same morality policing that religions have so often tried to force onto the populace.\nIt is insulting as well, by saying that the media (too broad a term for this conversation btw) can't portray something in a certain way you are not only engaging in censorship, but you are also implying that it is somehow wrong to be that thing.\n\nI study game design, and once again, it is entirely up to me what I create. And what we create is a combination of what we enjoy and want to create, and what sells.\nIf I want to create for instance a fighting game where large breasted women fight in bikinis, and someone else wants to buy that game, that interactions is entirely between us.\n\nTelling me I have to create something else just because you want me to is the epitome of entitled. No one is entitled to having the content they want. I wish there was more metal on the mainstream media, but I don't get to force eminem to make metal, or force a radiostation to broadcast it. I just have to accept that I can't always get what I want, and that if I really want it, I should go out and create it myself. That is what an agent does, an object just complains about it and assumes others will fix it for him/her.\n\nThere is also a problem with the term \"portrayal\", it implies that the product is pretending that a certain character reflects what we think a certain<b>  gender</b> is in real life, or \"should\" be. But this is almost never true, take princess peach. Some people like to complain about how this portrays women as damsels in distress. The problem with that argument is that princess peach wasn't designed to reflect a female stereotype, but instead to appeal to a male stereotype fantasy.\nThe fantasy of being a hero who risks his life to help women. No one designed princess peach and went \"well, what should she act like, well, she's <b> a woma</b>n, so let's reduce her to a damsel in distress\".\nNo, what happened is that the game was created and the designers needed a goal for the target audience. And what motivates a bunch of men most? Seeing<b>  a wom</b>an in distress. The trope directly reflects, utilizes, and perpetuates a (potentially harmful) M<b> ALE gen</b>der identity stereotype, not a female one.\n\nHowever, I don't think complaining about this does anyone any good, because it's insulting. It's basically saying \"you are such a weak object that you can't make decisions for yourself. Instead you are a slave to the media, you are so weak that being called \"bossy\" will prevent you from becoming an engineer\".\nThe only really negative portrayal of women is by people who act as if \"women are not strong enough to handle a world where strong male agents have desires and preferences.\"\n\nI also dislike this notion of society as an outside construct, enforcing their will on women from above. it obfuscates the issues and relieves women from blame, which ironically plays into and enforces the \"women are objects\" stereotypes. Why are women portrayed as beautiful in the media? Because WOMEN want to be beautiful. Why are men portrayed as strong? Because MEN want to be strong. Hell, more than once my girlfriend has stopped watching a movie because she thoug<b> ht a w</b>oman in it was so ugly that she honestly didn't want to see it.\n\nWhat we call society is just the mishmash of individual male and female actions and preferences which results from their freedom to express themselves. So when people want to change society my first question has to be \"ok, so you want to socially engineer society, whose freedom do you want to take away first?\".\n\nI dislike the fact that men are always \"portraye<b> d\" a</b<b> >s fa</b>t dumb idiots whose wives are too good for them. But I don't get to tell people what to watch or what to create.\nThe only portrayal I really find offensive is when there is another anti-domestic abuse campaign and men are again the aggressor. Portrayals that actually try to reflect reality and are sexist in doing so. \n\nSo where does that leave us when it comes to complaining? After all, you can complain about a movie being crap and not have it be some sort of breach of the directors rights to make that movie. And I agree, you do have the right to complain about some of this stuff. But I advise against it, it is a waist of time, arguably immoral, and will make you miserable.\nIt's a waste of time because you can't change biology. It's immoral because if the only fix for what you are complaining about is tyranny, then you are directly contributing to helping tyranny get a hold, at the very best you are simply annoying people who just want to be left alone. And choosing to fight things you can't change instead of embracing them will only lead to misery. For you and the people you infect with your way of thinking.\n\nthere is only one correct response to deali<b> ng with</b> gender stereotypes. It's not by trying to force them out of existence, you can't, because they are descriptive, not prescriptive. \nThe correct thing to do is not to pretend that some people aren't different from the norm, but to teach them that it's ok to be different from the norm, teach them the<b> y're n</b>ot weird, they're special.",

                    "commentText": "@Madison Healey It's not a straw man, I am not saying that you are consciously advocating for tyranny or censorship. Or that your argument is that those things are good. I am not trying to misrepresent your argument, but show how this line of reasoning either leads to those things, or shows an underlying system of thinking that is unintentionally oppressive.\n\nFor instance, there are currently people who think salary negotiations should be removed because men tend to hold out for more money, which is unfair towards women.\nNow in no way are they directly arguing that women can't compete with men, but the belief that women can't compete with men is a direct requirement for that argument to make sense.\n\nI have noticed that this <b> gender </b>stereotype of women being weak and in need of protection is a fundamental aspect of nearly all the arguments of modern day regressives.\n\nOne obvious place this underlying belief emerges is when we talk about representations of men and women in media.\nIf men and women are free to make content, and represent themselves and each other in whatever way they want. Then the only reason to regulate in any way how one<b>  gender</b> is portrayed is because you believe thi<b> s gende</b>r has a natural disadvantage. Why would yo<b> ur gend</b>er need a leg up if they are fundamentally equal?\n\nYou say you don't want to impose certain standards and that's great. But by going out and perpetuating a culture where there is currently a sort of social morality police that cracks down on things they find offensive, those standards are certainly being imposed.\n\nYou yourself talk about how women are \"portrayed\", the underlying belief there being that these portrayals impose on women that they should act in a certain way. So if you accept that rules can be imposed that easily, then surely you must accept that this social morality policing also imposed on the freedoms of the individuals who just want to create content.\n\nSo the big picture I see here, condensed into a few sentences, is this.\n\n1: It is wrong to tell people how to live their lives.\n\n2: Other people living their lives influences me, and thus tells me how I should live my life.\n\n3: Therefore, I should tell them how to live their lives.\n\nI agree with the first part. But when we get to the second part, I have problems with it. It is technically true, but it is the attitude of an object, people who do this fail to hold themselves accountable for their own actions. This does not encourage them to better themselves, which encourages mediocrity, which in turn causes them to do less well in life, which they can then in turn blame on others, creating a vicious circle.\nBut mostly I object to it because it leads to point 3, and most people don't see that. You can't stop society from telling people how to act, by telling people how to act.\n\nThere are two ways in which society can tell you what to do. As an example, take hair length.\nSociety can tell you directly \"women should have this hair, period\" like in north korea. People can tell you directly, \"you shouldn't be allowed to do this because I don't like it\".\nThis is direct oppression and should not be tolerated.\nThen there is the secondary or indirect form. Which comes in the shape of \"Women feel like they should have long hair because other women tend to have long hair\" or because \"men are more attracted to long hair\".\n\nThe reason this should be accepted is that fighting it means enacted the first type, direct control of what is and is not acceptable.\n\nLong story short \"You shouldn't have long hair because I don't like it\" is not ok, \"you can choose whatever hair you like, but I am not attracted to short hair, do with that what you will\" is ok.",

I'm a <b> woman,</b> and I work in a STEM field (Software Engineering). I never used to think there was any<b>  sexism</b> in science. I couldn't see it. It used to seem clear that the problem lay with girls who were not used to being outnumbered by guys.\n\nI thought that even after the first few times I was told that my experiences weren't valid because I was a girl. I now have to wonder at every problem and every promotion whether the problems would still be there if m<b> y gende</b>r was different. More than once I've thought I had a good working relationship with someone and then, when I voice a view that is valid but out of the ordinary, I get told that I don't know anything about that subject; or that most people (meaning the men they know) don't do things that way.\n\nI have fought for a long time to be seen as a good programmer. And then I see young male grads come in already believing they're the best and getting validated for that belief. I get questioned on my authenticity as a programmer regularly: \"Do you know this framework'', \"Have you ever programmed this obscure language\", \"Have you even used this operating system\". Mostly the answer is yes. But the men surrounding me are never grilled in such a way. My experience should be able to be inferred from my position in the company.\n\nThese are just personal views and experiences. And that is the big problem with discussions about sexuality a<b> nd sexi</b>sm. Is that none of these situations would be remarkable on their own. But when it's continuous (and I know many women with the same stories) it seems remarkable to people who can see <b> the sex</b>ism that it's not noticed more. That shirt is frustrating because I fight every day to be seen as a programmer before people notice I'm a pretty girl. Shirts like that show me that men want to look at pretty girls rather than work with them.\n\n(Again, sorry for being far too late to this conversation.

And I'm sure if he knew beforehand the drama it would start he never would have worn it.\nStop creating boogeyman that don't exist.\nIf it's YOUR opinion that something is offensive guess what that's YOUR opinion. Just because you feel it's offensive doesn't necessarily mean it is, it may mean your just a weakling. Not every <b> woman </b>is so weak that a t-shirt makes them cringe and go weak with fear. Some actually step up and fight REAL inequality not fake first world feminist issues.",

Pointing out that people get raped does not prove the existence of a rape culture, only the existence of rapists.\n\nWhat determines whether or not there is a rape culture is how we as a society look at the act of rape. Do we condone it? Act as if it's ok? Do we encourage it?\nAbsolutely not, we as a society seem to be oversensitive when it comes to rape, as soon as it happens, all rational discourse goes out the window.\nYou want to do the slightest examination of how the act came to be, or even give advice on how to protect yourself? \"VICTIM BLAMING!\".\n\nEven joking about rape or portraying it in the media can apparently cause mass hysteria.\n\nIt's gone so far that the mere accusation of rape can ruin a persons life. NO ONE is saying rape is ok.\n\nNow compare this to for instance murder. \nYou could say we live in a murder society, half our movies are about people killing other people. Half our games are about us killing each other. It's an act that is arguably glorified.\nWe even sometimes deal it out as a punishment. Everywhere you look online people go \"they should shoot this son of a bitch\" or \"I would kill the person who did that to me\".\nHell people dying is a <b> common </b>subject of laughter.\n\nLook at game of thrones, half the cast gets murdered or mutilated, with penises being cut off everywhere. But as soon as one castmember gets raped there are cries of<b>  misogyny</b>.\n\nThis is not a rape culture, it's a rape hysteria culture, and it's getting worse by the day.\n\nThere is one area where you could argue that there is a rape culture btw. Against men.\nWho, when they get raped, often get a chorus of \"nice\". People act as if it's no big deal, as if he should be happy. There have been definitions of rape that even exclude male victims. Male victims have been made to pay child support to female abusers. When men go to prison, \"don't drop the soap\" is <b> a commo</b>n warning outed with glee at the prospect of them getting RAPED!\nAnd in movies, men getting raped is most usually depicted as comical. \n\nNow if despite all that, you want to pretend that women live in a rape culture, go ahead. But don't expect people to take you seriously when you do.",

You are not telling me what a rape culture is, you are telling me where I can find one.\n\nLet's sum up this conversation.\n\nYou claimed that there was a rape culture.\nI assumed you used the standard definition of a culture that normalized and condones rape.\nI clearly showed how that example does not apply to modern western nations.\n\nThen you made a complete non sequitur by ignoring the classic definition of a rape culture and instead trying to prove rape culture exists by stating the amount of rape that occurs.  Moving the goalposts from \"does culture condone rape\" to \"do rapes occur\".\n\nWhen I proved that stating numbers of rape with no context makes no sense, and proved that the number or rapes in our culture is extremely low (using YOUR number mind you). You ignored the question I posed you about how low the number of rapes in 100.000 has to be before you admit that there is no rape culture. Instead you suddenly and conveniently tried to switch back to claiming that our culture does promote and condone rape, but since you lost the culture argument, you now switched to sub-culture.\n\nNow we are getting somewhere I thought, you are already starting to understand that our culture hates rape, now you just need to put the last few pieces together in your fragile little mind and understand WHY these people have to hide away. But no, you completely threw up a <b> mental </b>roadblock to avoid having to admit that you were wrong.\n\nNow, in all this I have repeatedly asked you to define \"rape culture\" and you have not done so. You have gotten no further than to claim that this rape culture (whatever that means to you) exists in some sort of subculture.\nA claim so vague and broad that it's even less specific or relevant than saying \"some rapes occur\".\n\n\"there is a subculture in our society that is a rape culture\".\nIf there were literally 2 people in our society who say to each other \"you know what, rape aint that bad\", then that sentence could still apply.\n\nCongrats, you've made such a mockery of this conversation that it's lost all meaning.\n\n\"Go see some people who are victims and ask them\"\nDon't you fucking dare, I've spoken more about this to victims than you will ever know. There are women I love who were raped repeatedly together with their sisters from when they were 4 until they were 14 by a family member. Don't you dare tell me I should just talk to victims. I know better than you ever will what kind of effect something like that can have on a person.\nI refuse to let sexist assholes like you denigrate their experiences by pretending that what happened to them is just part of the female experience, or that it is somehow comparable to someone who had<b>  sex</b> and regretted it afterwards. By some of the bullshit definitions I've heard people use I was raped, hell I was raped by every girlfriend I've ever had if I had to use feminist standards.\n\nI will not use those standards, I will not compare real victims of horrible crimes to entitled bitches why refuse to take responsibility for their own actions.\nHow dare you.\n\nI refuse to continue this discussion with you, it's clear that I can't change your mind since you are not open to having it changed. \n\nLuckily I don't have to, I'm glad others will be able to read this reply chain and see how disingenuous your side is.",

                    "commentText": "I believe that the key point in this argument that in most first world countries, it is the legacy of patriarchal attitudes that live on, not the attitudes in their entirety. Traditional portrayals of women in stories like Cinderella and Snow White have had immense impacts on today's culture, as seeing or reading the stories even once as a child has the potential to cement in that young mind what their <b> gender </b>makes them \"inclined\" to do. Stories like these make up a sort of mythos that is supplemented later by news stories and advertisements and eventually real world examples that suggest to us that those stories had an element of truth in them. We grow older, unknowingly carrying on these values, and eventually pass them on to our children, starting with the fairy tales. \n\nThis is where the distinction between institutionalized<b>  sexism</b> and de facto, everyda<b> y sexis</b>m becomes clear. Our roots as a society are so deeply grounded in sexist attitudes that nearly everything we do or touch serves to in some way affirm what we were predisposed to believe. \n\nIt is in this context that I believe that this shirt is insignificant. Attacking a man for what he wears is not going to change the fact that nearly everyone in the United States received their first bit of education abo<b> ut gend</b>er from fairy tales, or from their parents directly (see Leave it to Beaver). I honestly have no idea how to fix such a problem as this, where the issue has become so intertwined with the society that it seems to be an integral part of it. \n\nAs a final aside, I would like to point out that, a<b> s a r</b>ace, humans have often tended towards distinctions base<b> d on ge</b>nder. As hunter-gathe<b> rers, s</b>exual dimorphism made it excee<b> dingly </b>common for men to hunt and women to gather. Nearly every society I can think of thought of women as lesser of fundamentally different from men. My question to you is this: why? The fact that this sort of distinction between men and wome<b> n is so</b> common, even in societies that never made outside contact, suggests something, but for the life of me I don't know what to gather from it. Are we simply predis<b> posed t</b>o sexism as a species?",

Objectification is treating someone like an object. Seeing as how objects are not sexually attracted to anything and how<b>  sexual</b> attraction of humans is a human exclusive thing, how exactly does one 'objectify' a human if they are engaging in a dimension exclusive to humans? This is like the ignorance behind asinine buzz words like 'homophobia'. Do you know what a phobia is? It's a psychological condition-anxiety disorder....do you have anxiety disorder because you don't support suicide or pedophilia? But I digress,<b>  'sexua</b>l objectification' is an asinine, nonsensical term wi<b> th ze</b>ro application used purely by moral busy bodies to feed their pathological desire to attack others and feel righteous in doing so.\n\nYour example is comparing apples to oranges and even then is deeply flawed. If aliens exist, and it's been DOCUMENTED that 60% of blue aliens eat humans, 0.1% of green aliens eat humans and 0%<b>  of<b>  </b</b>>red aliens eat humans, <b> which </b>alien population would you feel the least threatened by?<b>  Which</b> alien species would yous end your<b>  3 y</b>ear old daughter alone to? Yes there is 40% of blue aliens that do not eat humans, but to claim that someone who says 'I don't feel comfortable being around something that eats my species' is unreasonable shows a remarkable detachment from reason. Not to mention, if <b> I were</b> a woman I would be offended. Moral busy bodies assume women are no more intellectually or emotionally capable than infants, unable to use reason. Why is it that romance novels and female fantasies can be created with impossible 'standards of masculinity' and men<b>  have t</b>he mental capacity to understand fiction and are not affected.<b> ..but</b> poor dumb women are as helpless children, unable to deal with male fantasies? I thought your big thing was women and men are 'equal'?\n\nYour statistics seem like bullshit. Citation needed.Even this biased paper claimed 20% of the STEM degrees are held by women....a VERY different story than the nonsense you claimed-that women hold the majority of ALL STEM degrees.  [LINK] \nIf women already have most of the STEM degrees there wouldn't be a need for STEM push in educational institutions because...they....already....have....degrees....in....STEM. So your picture is this:\n'We need to ENCOURAGE more women to get into STEM!!!'\n'Most of STEM already ARE women, but because they have the EQUAL working conditions as a man they run away!'\n-__-\n\nI hope at some point you realize the hypocrisy in your line of thinking. The mere fact you want maternity leave shows that there cannot be the sort of 'equality' you lot claim to clamor for between men and women. Know why? Men do not have child pay leave. If men do not have it, then why do women? Answer? Because men and women are different-they are not the same. Yet you want to (when it suits you) force 'equality' in everything. Men and women are not 'equal'. 'Equal' means the same. One side cannot have ANY differences to the other......biology already proves me right, but you people like to ignore reason and reality. If women have maternity leave, men should get paternity leave. You get paid leave for a number of weeks when you are expecting a child, regardless of what genitals you have between your legs. THAT is equality. I do not hear anybody arguing for paternity leave.\n2=2 \n2+2=4\nWe are different. We are of equivalent worth, we are complimentary, we are not the same. Maybe there are less women in STEM for the same reason there are less men in behavioural sciences (which I do not see any initiative to force parity in female dominated fields, btw)-men and women are attracted to different things. The problems with your ideology is you have things backwards. You think the traditional expectations are forced on both genders, rather than the traditional expectations being formed from long term observations OF the general characteristics of both genders.\n\nWhy bother...you people just blame everything on other reasons, are never satisfied and throw temper tantrums when someone disagrees with you. \n\nWant to blame the media for police offers be<b> ing wa</b>ry of black peop<b> le (an</b>d I am black btw, though not an nor living in America)? How about you deal with the fact that despite being 14% of th<b> e popu</b>lation, black Americans are significantly more engaged in criminal activities than whites who greatly outnumber them?  [LINK] \n\nWant to blame 'society' for STEM not having a 50-50 split? Why aren't you complaining about female dominated spheres not having 50-50 splits like nursing (>90% !!!), teaching, psychology, vets?  [LINK] \n\nWhile we're on professional parity, can we have more women sweating in the hot sun doing manual labor in construction and more men in nice AC office jobs?  [LINK] \n\nCan we also try to get more women to commit suicide so we an have a 50-50 split as well?  [LINK] ",

None of the <b> gender </b>differences we have studied today existed before agriculture, and many of them didn't exist until very recently. Before Victorian times, men were stereotypically emotional and women were sterotypically logical and rational. Talking about feelings was considered masculine before the Wild West movies of the 50's popularized the strong silent type. The behaviour of animals varies so wildly from species to species that you can't trace any real<b>  sex</b> difference trend across them, though some people certainly like to cherrypick events that look similar to moder<b> n gende</b>r differences.\n\nMo<b> st gend</b>er differences in our culture can be traced back to the division of labour that occurred when agriculture began 10,000 years ago. Before agriculture, men and women traveled together, hunting, trading, raising children, and there was no division of labour. Agriculture required that some people go out to hunt and trade while others stay behind to tend the home and care for the children. Since women get pregnant, they were relegated to the latter. Evolution occurs over millions of years, not a few thousand, so this cannot have made anything hard-wired in our brains.\n\nAs for STEM, considering all the studies that keep showing that people discriminate enormously against women in stereotypically male fields, and all the companies who have reported that their female and minority hires shot up once they started blacking out names on resumes, it's clear that we aren't free.  We are following unwritten rules that were made up thousands of years ago, which are obsolete now and cost us enormous talent. It's not individualism to constantly blindly follow obsolete rules. Think how far we could have come as a society if we were utilizing all of our talent!",

Also, a lot of the statements you are making are just false. \"Why are the women in action movies always sexy and rarely useful?\" Really? They are rarely useful? You should name the action movies you are talking about. Give statistical evidence. Stop spouting lies. Also, men are in underwear plenty of time. I can't think of any female heroes who are only in underwear, but I can immediately think of a male one: Hulk. And lastly, no one is forcing you to watch movies you don't like. If you want to see more \"female-centric\" films, then go make one yourself. Or take the time to watch an independent film rather than the endless sequels to stupid Marvel films.",

They are choosing to monetize their beauty. You seem to think there's something wrong with that. 3. If you really care so much about seeing ugly women in films, why don't you find other people who agree with you and you can start a kickstarter page and make a low-budget movie with lots of ugly women. If people like it, and it becomes a box office success, Hollywood will surely emulate it. 4. (and most important) You can just choose not to watch movies that sexualize women. MOVIES ARE NOT A PUBLIC GOOD. They are made BY PRIVATE COMPANIES for PRIVATE, PAYING AUDIENCES. Are you saying people who want to see hot women on film should not be allowed to?",

Surely we can extend the same to the scientist.\nThere is a different discusion to be had though about the impression the shirt gives of STEM generally. but like i said, surely that falls into it being bad taste rather than anything more insideous.

The \"Women earn 60% of all graduate degrees, yet hold less than 25% of STEM jobs.\"\u00a0\n\nFirst of all that seems like the kind of statistics that kills off a lot of sports programs across the country, because schools have trouble getting as many female students to go for some sort of sports, and some morons have decided that true equality is that both sexes share the same interests. Ergo the female whatever team needs to be as big as the male team. The lack of reason and logic behind that thought is amazing. What if... What if women tend to be drawn towards other things than STEM? ..and again: Why would you think that this man's not so great looking shirt, would be worth fighting against? If it keeps women away, they had no business in STEM in the first place. They have no business in the real world tbh.\u00a0\n\n....and.. How come we only hear moaning when it comes to lines of work/study/whatever, that's dominated \u00a0by men? How come noone speaks out against the areas where men aren't as represented? Basically the answert is: <b> Sexism,</b> disguised as feminism.\n\nHonestly..<b>  Woman</b> aren't weak little fragile things, unable to make it through the day if they see a few cartoon women on a shirt. Not real women that is. This hooplah is bullshit.",

I am disgusted by ideas of male <b> sexism,</b> when most of the time it is either false statistics, biased \"facts\", or ignorance. This feminist movement has gone too far, now it is a monster that's sole purpose is to destroy men. As a man myself, I used to get angry at feminism for taking blinded throws at what is \"equality\", but now I am just disappointed that people could be so ignorant and not even try to come to the light that they are simply uneducated on what is really happening with all that they believe is wrong with the world. Whenever inequality towards men is brought up it is quickly shot down and spoken over by feminists who think that anything a man does is evil. They feed on statistics \"against them\" because it \"proves that they are oppressed\" and it is disgusting to see the world succumb to this kind of nonsense.",
