        "postText": "'The French Senator, who serves as the co-chair of the Senate Brexit Committee, admitted several sectors would take a severe blow once the UK quits the European Union. Despite Emmanuel Macron having voiced his opposition to further delays to the Brexit deadline, Senator Cambon warned Brexit would have catastrophic consequences for France's economy due to the close relationship Paris and London share. Speaking to S\u00e9nat in Action, the Senator said: The departure of Great Britain is something catastrophic for a series of professions.', 'Our farmers, our fishermen, our businesses, and the regions of Normandy and Haute France. It will have consequences for all these areas and for the whole of the EU, it could even give other members some ideas.', 'That\u2019 s why we want to follow the process step by step while abiding by the competences of the Senate.', 'Members of the French fishing industry have indeed voiced their concerns over the risk of seeing their access to British waters cut off due to either a no deal Brexit or radical changes to current agreements with the UK.', 'Pas-de-Calais Senator Catherine Fournier suggested 75 percent of the fishermen living in her constituency could lose their  total revenue should they not be able to fish in UK waters.', 'Ms Fournier said: Around 75 percent of fishing taking place in Haute France takes place in British territorial waters\u2013 75 percent.', 'It\u2019s vital to fishermen, it\u2019s their total revenue. What will be of them? What type of agreement could they get? When you invest on a fishing boat, the investment is huge. ', 'Trawler Eric Gosselin said members of the fishing community in northern France have been fishing in British waters since the Middle Ages and Brexit could force Brussels to agree to changes to the Common Fishing Policy(CFP) regulating fishing across the bloc.', 'Mr Gosseling said: It\u2019s been generations \u2013 I\u2019m part of a community that has been fishing in British waters since the Middle Ages.', 'It\u2019 s the rule of relative stability which has been regulating access since the EU was formed, which has regulated the repartition of quotas, the percentage according to which the quotas should be distributed.', 'The fact we have a country withdrawing could suggest the relative stability rule should be renegotiated.', ' He continued: There are countries, like Spain, who have been urging for a change of the rule and other countries who claim they have been catered to badly.', 'Truly, France has been favoured by this rule of relative stability. ', 'But the chief executive of the British Ports Association Richard Ballantyne suggested Brexit offers fishermen a once in a generation opportunity to help relaunch Britain\u2019s fishing industry.', 'The fishing communities in the UK have long lamented the limitations imposed by the CFP which regulates access to waters in the bloc and imposes strict control on the number of fish fishermen can catch.', 'Mr Ballantyne said: \u201cFor the first time in 40 years the UK will soon be setting its own fisheries policy.', 'This could be a once in a generation opportunity for UK fisheries.', 'Above all, it is critical that a transformational fund is put in place to support this transition towards prosperity and that Government policy is put to work to support coastal communities by ensuring that more seafood is landed in the UK.'",

Some times you can have a boat that after it gets to a certain age it actually slowly increases in value every year.But like all ways to enjoy yourself messing about on the water, wait until you see the annual bills for repairs and renewals on it, you will wish to just to have the annual depreciation instead.",

And - no - it doesn't necessarily depend on the vessel's age in regard to commercial fishing, as an older vessel could catch as much fish as a more recent one of equivalent design and recover its initial investment easier than a more expensive newer boat. In the case of trawlers, it was the equipment - particularly the trawling equipment and nets - that were the largest ongoing liability. The fact remains that late registered vessels in excellent seagoing condition sold for as little as a twentieth of their cost price and were snapped-up by foreign buyers. Even then, the fleet had been so large that many had to be simply be scrapped. I was there, I saw it happening. Where were you?",

The rest of us, looking for the trade, but having poor quality politicians also grabbed into the eu. The yanks do power but money as well, similarly chinese but strange politics, us lot were like lesser copies of yanks, but on same route - this eu plan seems to have turned it all upside down. Seems its power, like control is its aim, at same time doesnt seem to need / want money to fund it, so it either skints us all through taxes, because its not doing enough biz or else its going pop, IMO.and screwing uk for the privilege.

Leaving gives the UK the opportunity to do its own, scientifically based plan to protect UK waters and to protect and encourage best practice by the UK's soon to be growing fishing industry. A plan that ONLY has the UK's interest at heart, but until the UK fishing fleet recovers I am sure there will be room for EU vessels in a carefully coordinated way to fish some of our waters for a while. This will give the EU time to support diversification of employment in their coastal communities. Difficult - yes, catastrophic - not necessarily.",

Whereas the other part of their economy takes the shyte and the farmers too, even though the handouts are there. Its probably a parallel to uk - but over here we know our lot are mostly ankers at the job and aces at milking us the taxpayers and yet, even democratically, haha, wew also, can do nowt about it. Also the french people are getting stirred up as the details come home - so who better to implicate than the ros - bifs and their <b> brexit </b>- and geez if the press word it right, they can convince average pierre its like waterloo - and thus diverting whats really happening in their own economy that their bureaucrats are...ing right up for them, now. Remember well pre<b>  brexit</b>, lots of frenchies came here - so we must have something right, and over there, for them its still wrong!",
