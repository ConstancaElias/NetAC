        "postText": "Channel 4 has expressed \u2018regrets\u2019 over news presenter Jon Snow saying he\u2019d \u2018never seen so many white people in one place\u2019 at a pro-Brexit rally in Westminster. But should it be apologising?', 'Ofcom revealed there were over 2,000 complaints about the unscripted comment, which demonstrates an underlying issue of how uncomfortable white people can be about being called \u2018white\u2019.', 'This is perhaps largely because they are used to being the default definition of \u2018people\u2019. Everyone else, however, is labelled \u2018BAME\u2019, \u2018POC\u2019 and \u2018non-white\u2019. Those are the nice words.', '\u2018Whiteness\u2019 has been scrutinised more in recent times than ever before in the UK and the majority, \u2018host\u2019 population had largely been able to live without thinking about race, which is a privilege in itself.', 'Saying \u2018white people\u2019 may be taken as an insult because it seems to generalise a large swathe of people.', 'Race and ethnicity lecturer at the University of Southampton Rima Saini explains: \u2018White people have not, until relatively recently in this country, had their race used as a homogenising collective descriptive.', '\u2018This has coincided with a rise in discourse on racism, white privilege and power in all areas of society.', '\u2018The critique around the Jon Snow incident also reflects a growing backlash against this [conversation on race]. There is a sense that the racial majority [should] have legitimacy conferred on them by default, as the \u201cindigenous\u201d national population.', '\u2018But by referring to them as a collective and problematising their racial status, a lot of deep-seated emotions, whether resentment or vehement denial, about the very real racial inequalities that abound in the UK today are raised.\u2019', 'So, in short, resistance to being called \u2018white people\u2019 is related to what \u2018they\u2019 feel is a legitimate claim to the land. Like how \u2018Indian food\u2019 in India is just called \u2018food\u2019, because it comes from there. In this way, it seems white people don\u2019t need to be referred to as such, they belong. Everyone else is just a guest or an added extra.', 'Some felt Snow\u2019s comments didn\u2019t have any relevance to the pro-Brexit demonstration and had he said, \u2018look at all these black people\u2019, it would\u2019ve been considered racially insensitive. But he was drawing attention to what he saw as the elephant in the room \u2014 the lack of ethnic minorities on the march. That\u2019s good journalism.', 'Framing this as reverse racism against white people fails to acknowledge the power dynamics so key to the whole subject area.', 'Grouping white people \u2013 as ethnic minorities so often are \u2013 is necessary to see how \u2018whiteness\u2019 is complicit in racism.', 'Examining white people as the dominant majority and how they affect the lives of everyone else \u2014 and why this is a problem \u2014 seems to be perceived as a threat. Frankly, it is a threat to white people who want to retain the advantage they have built up over hundreds of years.', 'So, Jon Snow isn\u2019t the enemy and neither are all white people. Ignorance is the enemy. And part of that ignorance is failing to see race.', 'Everyone is affected, it\u2019s just a question of whether you recognise that. Then assess whether your racial background and make-up are working for or against you.', '\u2018White people\u2019 reacting defensively to the issue is a clear example of white fragility on race issues and does nothing to further the conversation. Part of that conversation is being able to say \u2018white people\u2019.', 'We need to have an honest discourse to dismantle conscious and unconscious feelings of white supremacy.', 'Being white is something to be aware of, not ashamed of.",
