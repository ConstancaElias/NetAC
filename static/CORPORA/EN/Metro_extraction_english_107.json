        "postText": "People of colour are used to having their skin described as food items.', 'We\u2019re mocha. Caramel. Chocolate.', 'And you know, that was ok back in 2003 when there were only about three shades for anyone darker than alabaster and the beauty industry hadn\u2019t had its Fenty revolution yet.', 'But in today\u2019s day and age, naming every darker shade after something edible seems backwards to say the least \u2013 particularly when it\u2019s done by a company which specialises in \u2018showcasing the latest makeup swatches on underrepresented complexions\u2019.', 'NYC-based beauty company Cocoa Swatches released a picture of a 35 shade foundation palette, ranging from very pale to deep brown. And while the selection of shades was great, the names that accompanied the colours left a lot to be desired.', 'The lighter hues were called things like \u2018cloud\u2019, \u2018pearl\u2019 and \u2018warm nude\u2019, but as soon as the colours became more brown, the names changed to \u2018honey\u2019, \u2018butter pecan\u2019 and \u2018tiramisu\u2019.', 'And you know, people weren\u2019t here for having their skin described as a dessert.', 'In fact, one Twitter user suggested that if the company insisted on naming darker skin tones after sweet treats, then they should also rename their lighter selection after pale foods:', 'if you\u2019re going to make 90% of the darker shades food names i want the same for all the pale shades. give me cauliflower, potato, tofu, chickpea etc idc. https://t.co/0J5oNXELNI', '\u2014 private hijabi (@faaaaadumo) June 16, 2018', 'Beauty brands have a duty to ensure that their products are empowering, both in their ranges and their marketing strategies \u2013 which makes this food-based fetishisation of skin tone seem way out of touch.",
