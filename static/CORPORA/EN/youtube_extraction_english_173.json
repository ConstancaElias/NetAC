        "postText": " Since you're on the Internet right now you've probably already noticed that this space is pretty much dominated by a younger crowd. You've likely heard them referred to as 'Millennials'. Or is it Gen Z? And how are they different from Generations X and Y? And how can you make heads or tails of which one you belong to, and what defines your generation? . According sociologist Karl Mannheim, it all comes down to 'generational location,' meaning that all members of a generation share a similar collective experience.. . TIMESTAMPS. The five generations 0:57. The Traditionalist generation 1:49. The Baby Boomers 2:30. The Gen Y 3:24. The Millenials 4:30. The Gen Z 5:31. What Millennials and Centennials have in common 6:35. . Music: . https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/.... . SUMMARY. -As of now, there are five living generations in the US: the Traditionalists, who were born before 1945. Then there's the Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964. Anyone born between 1965 and 1979 are considered Generation X, while Millennials, or Gen Y, were born between 1980 and 1995. Finally, there's Gen Z, or Centennials, who were born from 1996 to the present.. -Most Traditionalists value hard work, commitment, and practicality, and they don't like to be wasteful.. -Boomers started out liberal, when they were involved in all the political and social movements, but then grew more conservative as they aged.. -Gen X got to experience the aftermath of all the changes the Boomers made. The use of computers also took off during these years, making Gen X more entrepreneurial than their parents and grandparents.. -Other generations complain that Millennials are selfish, entitled, narcissistic, addicted to their phones, lazy, impatient, impulsive, overly sensitive, weak-willed, and the name-calling goes on and on.. -Gen Z also tends to value collaboration more, in both school and work. They have a very different relationship with digital devices than previous generations.. -Millennials and Centennials share the most similarities and collective experiences out of all the living generations, so there's a lot of debate about the exact range for each of them.. .

My entire life is characterised by Gen X instead. Lock & key. Minimal adult supervision. Peer oriented.  We had the easiest access to tertiary education, when compared with previous generations. The computing industry took off. And everyone I know who was born in the 60's says the same thing. The Boomers lit the way for us. But we're not of the same cloth. We can't relate to Woodstock or the hippy culture either. Instead, our entertainment was defined by discos, Michael Jackson videos & Atari games. Whilst at work, we wore power suits with giant shoulder pads. And giant hair do's. None of which the boomers liked, let alone participated in. I think they need to re-define Gen X & baby boomers. They're totally different animals.",

However, if I actually saw it on TV, I would have remembered it even today, cause my memories start from 99 onwards. My vivid memories start maybe from 2002 onwards give or take a few months on either end. God decided to not make me watch tv cause he knew it would have scarred me for life, especially the part where the two towers have smoke coming out from the top of them and then minutes later, they both collapse one by one. Who would want to remember that? If remembering that is the only way someone can become a millennial, then who would want to become a millennial? Also, I dont remember Hurricane Katrina on the news and I learned about that only in third grade. The hurricane happened when I was eight the summer before third grade, and I can remember that summer even today. So there ends everything. I lived through both of these disasters as a kid, so thats what counts. Even a person born as early as 1992 may not remember 9/11, but they are considered millennials in every source.",

If you do a quick search online or do research for yourself, you'd find that Pew Research Center is regarded as a VERY reliable site since it was created in 2004. Pew Research Center has an excellent reputation for being fair, accurate, and reliable. It is a 'nonpartisan, nonprofit, and employs high quality researchers who generally use the best possible practices'. Unfortunately every generation has a cut-off year whether we choose to disagree or not. Let's say someone was born in 1965, that represents 'Generation X'. Though he may relate to someone who was born in 1964 which is the cut-off year for 'Baby Boomers' doesn't not make them still categorized as being Generation X. Its more based on societal events, then technological events.",

            "commentText": "Personally I disagree that gen z should be 1995 - present, because with the expansion of technology and the influence of it on our everyday lives I think groups with collective experiences are smaller than before. For example, I was born in January 2001, my nephew was born February 2011, and I can see very clear differences in our childhood experiences, I didn't grow up with a tablet or online games and youtube, I grew up with cartoons and PC disc games. I'm sure in other generations they have people who feel like they cant relate to others who are supposedly in their generation, but I do think that with technology taking a more active part in our lives collective experiences are becoming more of a niche thing and that the generation timelines should take that into consideration. Like there is a lot of people who think that 1995-around 2003 should be their own sub generation because we do have very different life experiences to the younger end of Gen Z",

I consider myself a strong cusper (inbetween) millennials and Gen Z but more on the millennial side for a few reasons. One, while I didn't have memories of 9/11, it was not ancient history for me because I was alive when it happened. Two, I definitely remember a time before iPhones and modern technology that really took hold around 2010. Three, I have never been able to relate to those younger than me, only people older. Between me and my sister (born in 2004, almost 2005) there's a stark difference between how connected we are to our friends and to the world, even though we shared many experiences growing up. Despite not having social media, my sister is deeply in touch with modern trends and stuff, while I seem to be behind on everything. So I consider myself and others born late 1990s to early 2000s (probably 2001 at latest) cuspers if they share my thoughts.",

Whatever you personally define the word \"millennial\" to be the word itself was coined by Neil Howe and William Strauss in 1987 to label the children born in 1982 estimated to be the first high school graduates class of 2000.  Look it up.  I remember the year 2000 was a huge deal and hype surrounding the year 2000.  Y2K, computer bug scare, the world would end etc. etc.  2000 is still a millennial year.  We left the 90s behind.",

I do not need machines to have fun..multitasking is a principle..i get lazy or tired if i only gave one or 2 things to do and especially if they are from the categiry i do not fancy so much..so having it all doing it all..now not next year..be myself is it..i think i am not compartimented as all these conditioned people are..i never allowed myself being pushed in any box..that helps..but i do love to share..so there i go..and am tolerant to all gen's.\n:-)",

So I have decided to take it upon myself to make the definitive statement as to who is and isn't a (real) Gen Xer. Any form of protest will not be tolerated and there can be no appeal.\nA true Gen Xer must meet the following prerequisites:\n1. Born after 1960\n2. Grew up during the height of the Cold War, and therefore has\n3. Distinct memories of Comrade Brezhnev standing on the balcony of the Kremlin overlooking the May Day parade in Moscow.\n4. Will say that they grew up in the 70s and 80s and not the 80s and 90s\n4. Had attained their majority ie turned 18 by no later than December 31, 1989\nSo basically if you were born after 1971 you're not a true Gen Xer so stop riding our coat tails\nGod does exist and His name is Billy Idol\nLong live the revolution.",

And they've had several: Kiddies, Hippies, Yuppies... etc.\nSo, growing up being told things like \"Your vote matters\" and then having every election decided by Boomers is why we're cynical. But, we have something special that Millennials and Gen Z didn't have an opportunity to have: we remember a time before computers, before cell phones, before school shootings, before endless war. I'm not saying we're better because of it, just that we have resources and recollections from experiences they don't have.\nMy heart goes out to Millennials and Gen Z because their upbringing has been overshadowed with so much violence. They have numbers we, Gen X, don't have and they will be the catalyst for change over the next 10-20 years.",

I don't know how any of us survived growing up: no seat belts, riding in the back of pick up trucks, drinking from a water hose that had been laying on the ground all day waiting for the hot water to run out so we could drink the cold water, playing from sun up to sun down, riding our bikes with no helmets or knee/elbow pads, playing on<b>  monkey</b> bars, sometimes falling and getting hurt. I don't ever remember anyone getting sued over it. Losing at something at school and having to deal with it. Failing a test at school and having to live with the fact that it was an F. But let me tell you we had sooooo much fun growing up. I wish times were the same. RIP good ole days!!!",

The first iphone came out when you were 6, but they werent widespread until like 2012. I remember before cell phones, laptops, and internet became widespread. I was 8 before introduces to any of those things. Of course, these things existed before the oldest millennials were even born.",

A generation must be given enough time to grow up and have children.  15 years isn't enough for that (a few teen pregnancies notwithstanding).  So youbhave to give a generation 20 years minimum, and maybe a few more.  Obviously we don't reproduce all at the same time but the basic concept is that each generation are the descendants of the previous generation.  You are thinking of cultural eras.",

The most revolutionary decade BY FAR was the 1960s and even they wouldn't be considered their own generation. Ironically, streaming 4k videos to  your phone in the middle of nowhere is not <b> common </b>yet at all today. Whereas 50% of American households did already have the internet by 1998. It was DEFINITELY<b>  common</b> by 2000, and not hard to access at all. Google and Ebay were exploding in 1999 and in 2001 Wikipedia got thrown into the mix.\r\n\nYour first device may have been a black-and-white Gameboy in 2007 but the first black-and-white Gameboy came out in 1989 and was an instant hit. And by 2004 the Nintendo DS had already come out which is the second best selling system of all time behind the PS2. And to someone who's older like me honestly there's not that much of a difference at all between a Nintendo DS and an Ipad. Both have touchscreens and both have kiddie games with 6th-gen-ish graphics.\r Add Tamagotchis to that and childhoods changed way more during the 90's than during the 2000's.\n\nAgain, ironically, the difference between someone born in 1940 and 1970 is HUGE dude, not at all \"the same toys and upbringing\" as  you said. Kids in the 40's were playing with wooden toys and maybe some board games, and if they lived through WW2 in Europe they probably didn't even have that. Meanwhile kids in the 70's had freaking video game consoles like the Atari 2600, legos, audio books, plastic Star Wars toys, action figures, easy bake ovens, doll houses, play phones, widespread access to arcades, and let's not forget the impact of Disneyland.\r\n\nAs someone who lived through it all, the rise of HD, easy-to-access online gaming, and smarphones cut the 2000's in half for me. 2004 feels a lot like 1997 and 2008 feels a lot like today. Trump's Election an<b> d Brexi</b>t are also bigger events than 9/11, reversing cultural trends that have been going on since the 1960's. The collapse of the Eastern block from 1989-1991 was also a bigger deal than 9/11. Overall, it just doesn't make much sense to define 2000-2010 as its own generation like you did.",

I'm glad I didn't, because I could avoid cyberbullying and all this stuff. I had enough at high school to give them more chances to annoy me. I could enjoy doing other kind of things and hobbies. In my opinion, teens shouldn't have a phone until they're mature enough to understand all risks which technology can bring. It has advantages and disadvantages and we have to take into account both sides. I'm writing as if I was an <b> old </b>adult, but I'm not. I belong to \"Generation Z\" too. I'm just worried for the premature use of technology without enough knowledge.",

            "commentText": "Born 1983 and I would say that people born in the early 80's can go either way (Gen X or millennial) or maybe even a sub category somewhere between the two. \nI relate more Gen x than millennials. Didn't have MySpace account etc. I have Facebook and YouTube but don't use Twitter or snapchat or instagram. I have several childhood friends (same <b> age)</b> that aren't on any social media at all and we communicate via calls and meeting in person, occasional texts but they're not as keen on texting. On the other hand I have other friends the same<b>  age</b> who fully are in the millennial category - in so many ways and as I get older I notice the differences more and more between the two types of people. It's odd because we are the sam<b> e ag</b>e and went to school together but it's like one group has fully embraced it and the other group not so much. \n\nWe were pretty late getting (dial up) internet in our house, I'm sure I was 20/21 by that time and getting ready to leave home anyway. I did have a mobile phone at 18 though - basic calls and could store 10 text messages max type of thing. \n\nI still have my original email account I set up when I was 18 - it's on yahoo.\n \nI still have a vhs player to watch all <b> my o</b>ld tapes but also have an extensive DVD collection. I don't download movies as I like to keep a hard copy when I've spent my money on something. Same goes for music. I still use and buy CDs. I've only downloaded about 3 albums in my life and have recently be repurchasing some of my worn out CDs. I also have<b>  an </b>old cassette player that I use to play <b> some</b> old concerts and stuff I taped off the radio when I was a teen. \n\nMy phone is over 3 <b> year</b>s old but still runs fine so I feel no need to replace it yet (it's an iPhone SE from when they first came out - I'm sure they are a good 5 newer models out by this point). I don't feel like I always need the latest tech and things which I do think is a millennial trait in general.\n\nAll that said I do think I'm pretty Internet and computer savvy. I know how to do stuff, I am aware of memes and what they are but don't really find it all that funny. I get the references and jokes made most of the time but I just don't find it all that funny. I do watch YouTube a lot, and a lot of the YouTube channels I watch are by millennials so I must relate to them in parts or I wouldn't follow them. I am attached to my phone a bit more than I would like to be and would be upset if the internet dies tomorrow.",

                    "commentText": "I think there should be more generations. The digitalisation, like social media, rapidly created types of generations. \nI would even say 95-00 are the ones who have grown up with Facebook and ICQ, name them how you want. The term \u201ememe' wasn't widespread, although there were comedic doodles like Trollface and Me Gusta, \u201eDinosaur with funny captions' type memes, Nyan Cat, This is Sparta/Remix, Caramel Dansen (the beginning of Weeaboism), Smoyoho\u2018s viral autotune songs. You watched Spongebob when it was still good and had advanced and hidden dirty humor. When you already watched Youtube back then, then you'd probably watched Pewdiepie in his early phase, playing Minecraft, Amnesia and A-Oni etc. And most impactful Minecraft! That's why i would call this generation \u201eMinecraft'.\n\nBut there also were annoying things i hated the most, these were \u201eCoD montages'. A buddy of mine showed off his Youtube account to me in 2008 showing his CoD 4 noscope montage made on his cracked Sony Vegas.\n\nNow as time progressed and the 05-10s came (i know i\u2018m very specific, but there\u2018s really a divided between people of those timeperiods, having developed such a distance like characteristically Babyboomers to millenials etc. ). \nThese are growing up, knowing the term \u201eMeme' already, because it's such a popular topic nowadays. They have our today\u2018s modern memes, Shrek memes, N-Word pass (Which i love them for, because they can make fun of socially forbidden topics, which we were too scared to even think about), Scatt-man, Gunga Ginga, Indespicable Me memes and TikTok (i find their humor hilarious when they prank superficial people there, because again, it's a heartly and ironic humor). \n\nAll in all, i can see how well our mew generation is developing in their social aspects. They say no to social platforms which trap them socially like Facebook did to us, (remember the news saying that Facebook is unhealthy for bullied people, and it stresses the social hierachy even more?). Instead they went on TikTok and trolled the people which tried to superficialize the platform like the teens did to Facebook showing off their looks and intimidating uglier people. Which i find perfect, the trolled people are mostly the people which would've developed a Napoleon complex in my generation, but the internet enabled more and more kids to stand up to them as groups, which could be good and bad.\nAnd most especially, they play Fortnite. You can't judge them though, we played Minecraft, and people before our generation hated the game and hated us for playing it.",

For the past 5 years with the rise of Social media and everybody using the same apps, new terms, it kind of  creates a sense of sameness and <b> age </b>gets a bit lost on the internet...10 years older than me or 10 years younger than me honestly it just doesn't make much difference  if we both shared similar upbringings during childhood. I feel you will always feel in the middle, for me a completely different generation would be anyone who was in their teens in the 80's and anyone born after 2010, most likely my future children's generation.",

Came home from school as a latch key kid and saw Freddie Kruger, Michael Myers, Jason Vorhees over and over again. Now I have two teens in Gen Z..

There WAS NO millennial generation yet to claim to belong to and that term was unheard of at that point. I was born in '84. My aunt laid it out like this...The Greatest Generation, The Baby Boomers and then me, Generation X. My aunt also worked in retail. There was a clothing brand that she sold in the store she worked in, exclusive to that store called \"Gen X\", sold in the Juniors department and geared toward my <b> age </b>group, which I also owned some of their pieces as gifts from her. If I was not Gen X or classified as such, then why would this even exist?? This \"Millennial\" term and demographic did not become a thing until my generation started having kids. Millennials are products of Generation X. I refuse to be called a Millennial when I remember the Gulf War, can work a rotary and payphone, tape players, record and 8-track players, can drive a manual vehicle, grew up on NKOTB, Debbie Gibson and The Bangles and 80s/90s hard rock. I grew up rolling windows up and down and locking car doors with NO power. I also grew up using one of the first<b>  Apple</b> computers available to the public (hell<b> o blac</b>k and green screen, prompts, code and hard disks!) And I'd also write this all in cursive, but Millennials wouldn't be able to read it. Ugh. I AM NOT A MILLENNIAL!! Millennials would be MY children!! Children born anytime AFTER Y2K are Millennials because it was the start of the new \"MILLENNIUM\". All these made up terms are starting to get on my nerves.",

However, the term Millennial (according to the 2 people who coined it) was called that as these were the first generation born who would graduate in the new millenium (year 2000). This makes Millenials technically start at 1982 (High school graduates of the class of '00). Also if you are in the US the census bureau classifies Millenials as starting with birth year 1982. Personally I go with this date as the people who coined the term do as well.",

Earliest memories of the world are the a Vietnam War and Watergate - being cynical and questioning authority is hardly a surprise. But the technology that the youngest generations are dependent upon (that's right - not tech savvy, but tech dependent) were developed and implemented by boomer and xer entrepreneurs. This generation is about a lot more than grunge, hip hop and the aids crisis and 9/11 had a much more profound impact on them. They have been online from the start and using computers (often that they built themsleves) since Jr High. While not all of them may know what makes a good meme or what it is to be meta, plenty do, so don't assume.",

Because anyone who is born in the late 90's and early 2000's had completely different childhoods from kids who are born in the 2010's. I classify my generation as: \"the generation who didn't have a smartphone as their first phone\" or \"the generation who still knows what a VHS is\". I'm born in 2001 and in my childhood i used to have a VHS player, my first phone was a Nokia with a number pad instead of a touchscreen and i had a Nintendo DS if i wanted to play video games on the go (most people had GameBoy Advance). While kids today (which i do not relate at all) don't know what a VHS is and they play mobile games and Fortnite.",

While millennials were introduced to Technology at an <b> age </b>they can remember, it is literally part of Gen Z's everyday life. Gen Z sees the global strife for many things as irrelevant, as it is something that will go on forever. Gen Z is less for government or commercials telling us what to do and believe, and are more realistic and individualistic.\n\nMillennials see travesties going on around the world as a means to take action, as they feel the world is getting worse, while gen z sees travesties as something that happens everyday, and they either want to release the burden of caring or they become depressed. \n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean that we are more or less apt to try to do our part, but it is usually used more as a learning experience than an act of sheer good will.",

We didnt have a computer until I was like 5, and got home internet when I was in third grade, and before that, never saw internet before. None of the computers in my school had it.

So when I was in my early teens & wanted to talk to my friends, I would pick up the phone. If someone else in the neighborhood was talking to someone, I would hear their conversation! Then I wouldn't be able to talk to my friend because the line was busy. Imagine if someone in your house was texting someone & you couldn't send a text until they were done.",

I would say that maybe the FIRST MILLENNIALS have similar upbringings then those born in the late 70s (even the very late 70s such as 1979) since 1979 is still technically Gen X but almost on the borderline of being a millennial. However,  the majority of millennials didnt grow up with the same things that Gen Xers have as kids. Even the late Gen x'ers.  I have seen different articles on this the the majority of them say that the millennial generation starts with those born in 1982. \n\n\nFor example, those born in the late 70s never had the internet or a cell phone available to them through out their entire child hood. While most millennials did.",

For example...I'm sure those born in the 90s have seen an <b> old </b>rotary phone but GENERALLY SPEAKING, people born during that time doesnt even know what a rotary phone is. The ones that know what a rotary phone is probably saw one from their grandparents.\n\n\nExample #2..I've met people born in 2000 and watch<b>  old</b> tv shows such as Three's Company or The Jeffersons.  But again, GENERALLY SPEAKING, people born during that time wouldnt have a clue what those shows are\n\n\nI was born in the 60s so I've used rotary phones, had <b> a blac</b>k and white tv and in my opinion, life was better in the olden days since we interacted face to face and played outside all the time.

And by then, late 70s babies were already technically  adults........(Those born in 1979 were technically kids until 1997).....Does this mean that people didnt use the internet or cell phones between that time period that i just put? Of course not. there were exceptions..but generally speaking, the majority of people werent using the internet or cell phones    until the early 2000s which is when it became popular in many house holds. In which the late 70s babies were already adults. So again,  how do you figure that people born in the late 70s \"grew up\" with technology? When technology became popular, the late 70s babies were already grown up.  I guess if you're definition of \"technology\" in those days  is having atari, nintendo, arcade games and pocket games then I'd agree with you. But certainly not the internet and cell phones. Perhaps maybe in another country but certainly not here in America. Sorry my friend but there are some differences. Especially when it comes to technology. Look it up for yourself",

The latter? Gen X. I was born several years after JFK died, and I was 4 when MLK, RFK died. I was about 7 when the Viet Nam war officially ended. So, many of the key things that defined the Boomers either predated me, or I was far too young to be a part of it. For later born Gen-X'ers, no worries, you were past Watergate, but there was always ABSCAM and IranContra. \n\nI remember when the first mention of us was calling us the 'Baby Busters'. Then came 'Slackers'. We didn't get 'Generation X' until Douglas Coupland wrote his book, in 1991, by which time, we were from the teens to late 20's.  I'm actually surprised we got mentioned in this, and I'm less than surprised that in your timestamps, we're mislabeled. laugh Pretty par for the course.",

If their parents were parents in the early 60's, chances are they were liberal as parents and their children developed the liberal mindset growing up.  If their parents became conservative later, it was probably after their children moved out.  I've ran into a lot of aged liberals that are in their 50's and 60's.  They hold respectable jobs, yet they have a left leaning and more open minded mentality.  They are their own generation.  They are often parents of the millenials.",

Yes we did grow up with the benefits of out parents, however we grew up during the height of the Cold War, we saw the Berlin War fall, we don't remember the moon landing. We grew up during the emergence of IT, so we are not collectively familiar with technology as our children. Yes we grew up with music videos, but when we were growing up we tended to listen to the music of our generation, not our parents. No one in his right mind who grew up in the 1980s would dare admit that they listen to the Beatles. Unlike, later generations who are happy to listen to the music of their parents generation. It is different now we are grown up, things changed in the 1990s. Hence in many ways we are a lot more like boomers",

The Greatest Generation (1910-1924) are the ones who worked through the Great Depression and nearly all of them fought in WWII. These guys were the ones who really experienced the hard times. That is how they got their title. The Silent Generation (1925-1944), only the older ones of this generation had to experience WWII while more than half didn't because they were too young. Yes a good portion of them were around for the Great Depression, but they were kids at this time. It didn't effect them like it did the Greatest Generation where they were working through that time. Both good generations but you are called the Greatest for a reason......",

I am 33 years <b> old </b>and find myself between both worlds of the millennial and Gen Xer. Yes, I related to much of what the video described of millennials, however I am less tied to media and technology than the typical millennial younger than myself. I remember the<b>  age</b> of no internet and having to sit near the wall to have a phone conversation. I remember getting excited for the super long phone cord my mom purchased for our phone that allowed me to stretch it to my room. I remember playing outside until the street lights came on, writing essays by hand or on my mom's typewriter when I got into my preteen years. I remember using huge floppy disks and popping records onto my moms record player. I, also, remember winding tapes with a pen, waiting as I rewinded back to my favorite songs, or pressing the record and play button simultaneously to record myself or songs on the radio. I remember cartoons and shows from the 80's as much as I remember shows from the 90's. I was filled with imagination and my childhood was less electronic and filled with make believe play, reading, writing and drawing. Yes, when the internet became a thing in my preteens, I was there for it exploring Yahoo, spending my free time on aol message boards and chat groups. Writing my stories by hand became typing them on our computer. I remember walking into Sam Goody's and the front half of the store slowly getting smaller for tapes, and the back half of the store being dedicated to CD's. Or walking into Blockbuster and them having the VHS and DVD versions on opposite sides of the store or next to each other on the shelf. I, honestly, feel like I am a part of th<b> e transitio</b>n years between millennial and Gen X, and am neither wholly one or the other. I think that t<b> he bla</b>ck and white classification of generations is erroneous and <b> the transit</b>ion is, more so, a blending of cultural shifts and values. Hence why the video states that the last 4 to 5 years of those classified as baby boomers find themselves not entirely relating to baby boomers and feeling an orientation towards Gen X. Same for the early classified millennial.",

And yes I got my first phone when I was 16 and it was a Nokia 8210. Technology is not bad I'm a techie myself but drowning yourself and getting depressed in the virtual and fictional world is a huge problem with teens nowadays. That is what concerns me.

I was born in 94, i just turned 7 when it happened and I have no idea where I was when it happened or the immeadiate after affects. I hated when every history class growing up asked us to write about how we experienced 9/11 because I didn't remember I always made something up. I think growing up during the technology boom of the early 2000s is wild. I got my first phone in 5th grade, it had snake, a text was a nickel a letter and my grandma got me minutes for it every month. It was only for emergencies and to check in when id go to a friends house. Technology grew faster and faster, through jr high and high school I got a new phone almost every year. (Thinking about <b> old </b>phones I'm gonna say that sliding keyboards need to make a comeback). I really don't remember butterfly hair clips, but I was obsessed with Britney Spears, Barbies and then Bratz when they were a thing. I was in high school when rage comic memes were huge and I joined MySpace just in time for everyone to leave to facebook about a year later. Personally I dont think generations should have such a broad range. I read somewhere that my moms birth year was at the beginning of the 'millennial' generation and I was born at the end (she was a teen mom). If I told her that she was a millennial shed probably argue and get mad.",

So I have the peer development and toughness of Gen X which I developed early in life, and the tech savvy of Gen Y which I developed later but while I was still young enough to adapt.",

My mother was the only gen x in her family of 4, the others were all boomers. I appreciate my technology, but I think we need to be careful what we do with it. I am glad that I never got addicted to social media or my phone. My peers complain that I am impossible to reach, I check my email once a day and social media 3 times a year. I check my phone like once or twice a week. My peers want me to check every thing twice a day.\n \nThere are some traditionalists like my some of my aunts and uncles who use technology more than I and even my boomer aunts and uncles use it more (for the aforementioned things) I might still use technology more because I am a hardcore gamer, but they still use social media more than me.\n\nI am amazed at just how amazing the generations are, like my grandfather (dad's dad) was born 1906 and  my grandmother was born like 1902. One was 94 and the other was 92 when they died. My grand parents were part of the Lost Generation, they had some awesome stories. My Traditionalist Aunts and uncles had some awesome stories too.",

Generations usually run across aprox 16-20 years. You don't connect with under 13 because those are literally children right now whereas you're a teen or young adult, but it's still the same generational span. Like, When older millenials were your <b> age,</b> the younger millenials were children, and totally unrelateble to them, but still millenials. Get it? This is more of an<b>  age</b> (childhood vs teenage/adulthood) than generation.  But in like ten years you'll see it very clearly how much it is the same generation, and also there just  isn't enough GENERATIONALLY  different between someone who's currently 18 and who's currently 10",

Boomers were born between the 1940s and early 60s (dates vary depending on which source you follow). The confusion stems from the fact that Gen X (MTV generation, forgotten generation ) is largely ignored bc society is obsessed with Boomers and Millennials. Millennials come after Gen X.",

What does and does not really matter is completely subjective, but in this case it's casually presented as being absolutely objective. I wonder why? I wonder how many nations share this \"factual\" perception? We can easily observe the adherence to this \"fact\" in Western Europe, regardless of public sentiment. ( having unelected \"representatives\" in an organization like the EU tends to render the will of the people irrelevant ) Still, I wonder if the much larger remainder of the nations of the world deem their borders to be something that \"doesn't really matter?\" I don't recall ever seeing much evidence of this.",

Both are straight A's students since grammar school to present, all in advanced classes, do lots of sports, After school activities & join the gym with me twice a week, do volunteer once a week on Sunday morning at the temple for 2 years But stop last year which was 2018. My younger daughter is a sophmore & the older one is <b> senior </b>and getting scholarship to Northeastern University & Umass of Boston. I'm hoping my younger daughter will get scholarships as well. You just need to be straight A's student & take lots of advances classes, get really high SAT score (almost perfect), do volunteer works, do lots of productive activities, write really good essays & be really active in school -- those are some of the qualities to get scholarships. \n I raises them up well, great manners, helpful, loving, kind, friendly, giving & positive.  I'm very hopeful that generation Z will do much better than Millennium & other generations.  My daughters also learning programming & coding at home besides all these school works & activities.  As a mom I put all my heart & mind into my kids, all my investments, earnings to my kids unlike the selfish baby boomer generation parents expected their children to give them all their pay checks & or allowances while they know their children still owe college tuitions& credit cards debt.  I'm a generation X.  Thank God/Buddha that I had my life plan out well even with all the obstacles I overcome everything years ago & could be able to give my kids a great life since they were little kids.  I hope generation Y & generation Z don't give up.  You guys have better technologies & you're really smarts & can do anything if you put your heart into it.  Good luck",

However, having parents born in the late sixties as well as growing up in a conservative and low-income household, I find my experiences to be much more similar to that of millennials than other Gen Z-ers. Like they said in the video, I obviously don't remember the events of  2001, but my family also didn't have a computer in the home or internet access until I was 9 or 10, more comparable to many millennials than children born today who are so much more submersed in technology.",

However I was using the internet to look up game guides and/or cheats probably as early 7 yo in around 2004.\nIt's interesting because my lil bro didn't take to tech anywhere near as much as I did, despite being born in 2001, however, my little sister born in 2016 has essentially been watching youtube since birth.\n\nCould well mean that my lil sis may fall lean into a Gen Omega if you were as a child who grew up with youtube since they were a baby, and touchwood me mum's expecting a 4th in July so it'll be interesting to see if they too go into this next generation.",

Then, I was raised by my Millennial Aunt for the last eleven years of my life. All the while, my biological uncle(b. 1980, may be a Gen Xer or Millennial, we don't know bro), had a small part in raising me. The result was me: a surprisingly progressive thinking person with standards and knowledge beyond his years. I can use technology, but only as a source of entertainment. Any other way, and I'm probably not gonna follow through with it. I have also become very \"ambi\" in nearly every way possible except for dextrous. Ambiverted although I had to acquire extroversion, Logos(logical mindset) and Pathos(emotional mindset) although I had to acquire Logos, I can read people, and can help people find the words for what they wanna say.

It conveniently espousing that technological advancement is synonym with 'social advancement' which is codified as 'left leaning' it carefully weaves positive terms like 'progress' 'sharing more' with and 'collaboration' of the recent generations while dismissing any criticism of the millenials as totally unfounded because the same criticisms can be applied to all generations.  Those criticisms, which are almost always related to work ethic and entitlement characterised by lack of appreciation are in fact self refuted in this video which qualifies hard work as a notable value in older generations due to tougher socio economic situations, war, banking collapses, austerity measures due to geo political tensions etc.\nNice bit of propaganda. Try watching Daysofnoah channel or Jonathan Haidt videos, Simon Simek for a non politicised newspeak liberal agenda supporting version of generations.",

People fight for their country in the 90s baby boomers fought in the gulf war but that really depended who you are. My father which was born in 1964 haa had bad times. He felt like his family was struggling for money. So in highschool he worked at a radio station and would always be late to class because of early underaged work. But even him got paid unfairly. And now present date he is an airforce veteran of the gulf war and works for the FAA and also builds stuff. The millenial hating boomers is only a stereotype.",

I believe that the people who played outside when they were in elementary school and got flip phones (that could only make emergency calls to 3 set numbers, of which were memorized) just leaving elementary, are defined as Millenials. If part of your childhood DIDN'T involve physically going to your friends door, knocking on it, and asking their parents if so and so can come \"out to play\" then youre not a Millenial. If you DIDN'T use Windows 98, or Windows XP then you're not a Millenial. These simple things are what I feel defines my generation and friend group... MUSIC is a whole other story hahahaa",

The bad part is how ignorant some people are when they say, \"young people are attached to their phones,\" when in a room full of them, but no one is actually on their phone. People take this stuff to heart when they should really just use it to gauge how different it is to live now than how it was then.  Don't complain about the differences either. Be happy there's innovation, it shows progress in society.",

Most people from Gen Y have no idea what I'm talking about when I recall things from the past.  People born in the 90s, even those who are only 5 years younger than me most likely didn't use a floppy disk, record songs off the radio with a cassette player, call #8531212 to get the time so you could set your watch when you didn't have a clock, or turn the knobs on a television set because it had no remote.  There was also no online gaming.  I had to use a landline phone, the one with a spiral cord attached, to call my friends and ride my bike to their house just to play with them.  I told all this to a Gen Z'er the other day and their mouth dropped open.",

Guess people born in 1996 like me are the ones who have a tough decision to pick which Gen they are, and if they want to be the baby of the Gen Y, or Seniors of the Gen Z.  Some day scientist will reveal the real cut off line of generation. I love learning about the different generations anyway.",

It really affects their personality. \n\nThey become dependant of technology. Heck, my brother('07 kid) doesn't even know how to spend a day without his phone/play station/TV. I remember playing outside with my neighbors, but not my brother.\n\nAlso, I think the kids born between 2010 - 2018 should belong in a new category. They're the ones that were literally born with touch-screen phones and VR headsets. They're born in the world of social medias, tech, influencers, etc. I keep seeing 2nd graders posing for pics, and the poses weren't really appropriate for a 7 yr <b> old.</b> Tik Tok really made a difference.",

            "commentText": "I personally think that Generation Z starts with 1995, but I know a lot of people born in 1999 who still think they are Millennials, which, in my opinion, is not the case. Like all generations, there are certain events that will take a toll on a generation and influence their personalities and how they act. I think the main ones for Gen Z (ignoring the technology aspect because that's all everyone talks about) are growing up in the aftermath of 9/11 and the 2008 recession. I think a lot of people tend to think of Gen Z as current elementary and middle school aged children, but this is not the case. Most Gen Z'ers are actually graduated from college and high school or still in high school currently (I also believe Gen Z stops at 2010).\n\nThose born in the late 90s and early 2000s, often referred to as those born on the \"cusp\" of generations, have a lot of similarities to each other, so I think they deserve to be grouped in the same generation. With regards to the US, I don't think most people born in 1995 have an accurate memory of exactly what they were doing on September 11 because, quite frankly, they were only 5-6 years <b> old </b>and likely weren't told the news when it happened because they were children. Of course, this all depends on physical proximity to the attacks. A 6 year<b>  old</b> who lived in NYC and possibly lost their parents, family friends, or many classmates lost parents in the attack is much more likely to remember the day itself. \n\nAlso, none of Generation Z was in the workforce when the 2008 recession hit. Most can't even remember it (myself included). The oldest in the generation would have been 13, and while they may have had some money to spend, they certainly weren't faced with a personal economic crisis and worry about their jobs and futures. Of course, their families likely went through this, so I believe this has shaped Generation Z to be a more realistic generation, especially with their money. We saw the aftermath of the recession, so I think most Gen Z'ers today are more practical with their future career choices, opting for a job that will pay well and will always be in high demand over a job in entertainment. I also think Gen Z is currently seeing Millennials with piles of student debt, so many of us want to find alternatives to college that will be the best for our future careers. Gen Z will \"settle\" for a college that maybe isn't as good as another simply to save money. \n\nI also think that, if you're talking about technology, Gen Z'ers born from the late 90s to the early 2000s have MUCH more i<b> n commo</b>n than those who are born in the late 2000s, and would possibly even call for a reclassification of Gen Z to just span from 1995-2005. This may seem short for a generation (since they are usually around 20 years long), but I think with technology changing so rapidly, the spans of generations are getting shorter. Information is being accessed much quicker now, and things change much faster.",

She saw me getting other people's opinions as weak and consulting others at proof that I didn't understand anything. But I did understand things. I just wanted to  continue to improve. Anyway, I left that job.\n\nAlso as a millennial, I feel like I'm constantly wanting to learn about new things. Even when I'm not in school, I'll enroll in short online classes to get better at different things. I'm constantly wanting to absorb information.",

We have a higher expectation of what we can get out of life compared to traditional gen x'ers, but still have a high degree of cynicism. We represent the hopefulness, and reinvestment into the American dream that came out of the uncertainty of our spot in the world post Vietnam, but prior to the end of the Cold War.

I was always Outdoors, I grew up in a small town with farmland and forests, riding my bike, building forts, trekking trails to hidden water falls. When I wasn't in school or outside, Saturday morning cartoons was that time we look forward to. I am glad I didn't grow up with internet, smartphones, dependency for Wi-Fi and the constant need to look at a screen. If work or everyday life didn't require me to have this technology now I wouldn't use it. I would still be okay with the landline and if I'm elsewhere find a phone booth. The dependency on technology could be a downfall, cuz if the system crashes... OMG what will we do.",

Contrary to the clich\u00e9, the vast majority of millennials did not go to college, do not work as baristas and cannot lean on their parents for help. Every stereotype of our generation applies only to the tiniest, richest, whitest sliver of young people. And the circumstances we live in are more dire than most people realize.\n\nhttps://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/poor-millennials",

As adolescents and young adults, they were dubbed the \"MTV Generation\" (a reference to the music video channel of the same name In the 1990  they were sometimes characterized as slackers, cynical and disaffected. Some of the cultural influences on Gen X youth were the musical genres of punk music, heavy metal music, grunge and hip hop music, and indie films.

YOU can make the good things happen. It all comes down to making good choices. CHOOSE to be just a little bit more positive! I am 64. At times, I felt just like you do right now. I found positive things that i liked to do with my family and friends. I chose a career that I loved and was very rewarding! The FUTURE IS what you make it! YOU can change your perception of society by doing something small or great everyday! Do something good for anyone-maybe a someone that is not even aware! There is something very Promising about the future and the coming generation!!!     WITH LOVE!!!",

While I do believe in self-sacrifice, the importance of choice and responsibility, and serving the <b> common </b>good, I fear many of my peers do not. From my observations, many of them seek a life of hedonistic pleasure rather than true purpose and meaning. Perhaps there is always that group in every generation, or perhaps this is a new consequence of modern society. Either way, only time will tell if my generation will rise to face the challenges that represent themselves or cower to a place of comfort and security. I will certainly play my part in making a better future. I cannot speak for the rest, however. \n\nOn another note, while positive thinking is a very useful tool, it must be balanced by skepticism and critical analysis, less one desires to be a target of deception and manipulation. \"Speak of the good, notice the bad\" is a personal motto I feel works well for most day-to-day situations.",

As far as some of the things your are noticing, I don't believe those traits are really characteristic of our generation. If you are a student of history, you might notice that the values and standards of ages long past are much worse than those of today. I actually regard today's society to be the most positive in human history, which has always been a struggle to survive with challenges that faced entire civilizations. However, at no point in history was there ever a culture that surrounded the world of global interconnectedness and cooperation between countries like there is now. It's still far from perfect with a lot of conflict a head, but we are moving to still brighter futures.",

What I find interesting is that Americans almost ALWAYS bash, belittle and/or ridicule the generation after them. Why do we do this and where does this apathy come from? I feel like it's inherited behavior. Because I find myself doing the same thing with \"Centennials\"",

Seriously different sources classifying generations differently. For example, some experts classify Millennials 1977-1995, 1980-1995, 1982-2001, 1980-2004, etc. Some experts classify gen z 1995-2010, 2001-2021, 2001-2025 etc. There are no exact year when generation begins and ends. So Gen X can be range from 1961-1984, Millennials 1977-2004, Gen Z 1995-2025. So whatever you decide which generation you identify with, there is no clear border on when generation begins and ends",

Remember that on september 11, I was watching fox kids and there was a text that an airplane has hit the first twin building, I ran to my mother and she said that I must have misread it, and I even believed her, then the the second hit was announced through text on the screen and my mother still didn't believe until 3 min later what they stopped my favourite kids show to show us how they are falling like sand castles pushed by child's finger. I remember the constant wars in Middle East and I like hip hop but despise the music from the 80s and up till late 90s. I don't remember the fall of the Berlins wall because I haven't been born yet and in my country actually this is the biggest deviation from the generations. I believe everybody born before early 90s has some real insecurity issues because of the unstable times they needed to work in. For Eastern Europe I would was that deviation is the followin: generation before 1887, gen between 1887 and 1920, 1920 till 1945, 45 till (landing on the moon), gen ~1960 till 1975, 1975 till 1990, 1990 till 2005, from 2005 till 2016 and from 2016 till now.",

Siblings born 10 to 15 years apart from the same parents are still the same generation. Much of their life experiences would be similar but a little different. One, say a person raised in the late 90s, would remember the turn of the century, 9-11 and the end of the hip-hop rap era.

They say we grew up attached to screens, but we really didn't. Only the super spoiled or super rich millennials maybe. \n\nI played outside and rode bikes when I was a kid, none of my friends had computers or cell phones, tablets didn't exist yet, Netflix didn't exist yet. iPods were brand new and technology like that wasn't considered suitable for kids by our parents. I listened to cassette tapes and CDs on my walkman. Watched VHS and later on DVD. Used a landline phone that was attached to the wall with a twisty cord. That was technology in my childhood. \n\nThings started to change when I was in middle school. I got my first video game system, we got our first family computer which I had very limited access to, it ran on our phone line so we couldn't be online very long bc my parents didn't want to miss important phone calls. \ud83d\ude02 A few of the lucky kids got a cell phone, but I didn't. \n\nFlash forward to my 10th and 11th grade high school years and this is when things start to change rapidly again. I get my first cell phone which was a flip phone that only does calls and text lol, we get wifi, I get my first iPod the iPod Nano, we get cordless house phones which were so cool and new to me, then we suddenly have video game systems with cordless controllers, and then Netflix. When I'm in 12th grade I get my first laptop. I don't get my first smartphone until I was in college and bought it myself and again I didn't have a tablet until a few years later when I bought it myself. \n\nBut all this new technology came around when Millenials were in their late teens or early adulthood. I am towards the very end of the millennial generation. Now we have all these smart devices and bluetooth too which I've only jumped on within the past year or so. But this stuff didn't exist when I was a child or my family just didn't have it. I remember my parent's first DVD player they ever bought and remember thinking that was such cool technology at the time, no more rewinding tapes \ud83d\ude02 We had a huge collection of DVDs and CDs even when I was in high school. Now we just stream everything. My high school years were probably very different from past generations, but my actual first 14 years of childhood were not really that different compared to generations before me.",

So yes, Clerks is a very late Gen X movie and almost a Millennial film. That is why Breakfast Club sits better in the Gen X zeitgeist.",

Gen X, in 2018, is now being given a range of 1965 to 1981 (16 years) and the Millennial range get (1982 to 2002).",

            "commentText": "I'm Generation X. Born in 1967. I remember when the term Generation X was coined. I remember certain aspects of the early 70's like movies and TV shows, but I don't remember the Vietnam War raging or Nixon as president. I was oblivious to politics and news. First president I remember was Gerald Ford. First movie seen in a theater was Snoopy Come Home. Glad I grew up in the times I did (but I wish I was a young adult in the late 60's into the 70's). I easily adapted to the new technology cropping up. 70's and 80's were an awesome time to be a kid. The 90's was what I call the 'last gasp' decade living off the fumes of the 80's (at least in terms of 'pop culture', movies and music). Downhill ever since. It's great everything is at your fingertips nowadays, but it removes any and all 'magic' and 'mystique' of a lot of things.",

The 1970s would always be my favorite Decade. The early 1980s were great the 1990s were hanging on by a thread. 2000s eh and nowadays well,Its all over with and this is my opinion but my profile name sums it up.",

The way i see it, I consider 1960 as the first gen x and 1959 as the last boomer. Like someone born in 2004 relates better to someone born in 2010 than someone born in 1999. In my experience, those born from 2000 onwards are different from those born from 1999 and before. Who knew the turn of the millennium makes a big difference between two people born in two consecutive years?",

Your high school years would of been from 96-00 when pretty much the Core X Culture from 85-90 was long gone. You're an Older Millienial like I'm and Older Edger but Generation X main youth culture was those from 67-76 Class of 85-94, like how Millenials main youth culture r those from 84-93 Class of 02-11 your youth leans more to the Gen X Culture but your adult hood leans more to the Gen Y Culture",

We had a computer when I was in grade school in the 80's. I lived through all the gaming consoles from Atari to nintendo, sega to playstation. We watched the space shuttle launches in school. We had internet in the early 90's. Someone born in 1965 didn't have the same experiences at all like me. My parents were still growing up in the 60's. Most of my life computers and cell phones have been around and I saw the technology improve. As a teen I was cool and had a \"pager\". Idk maybe I'm my own generation. Lol. Any other Xers have Boomer parents and can relate?",

It's like the media is obsessed with millenials and boomers and even gen Z now,  but they rarely ever talk about Gen X,  they get so much overlooked. It's <b> weird </b>because people in 40's - 50's are a relevant <b>  age</b> group,  they are or will be  in charge of much of the world, especially now that boomers are retiring or dying off but the media still won't pay them much mind and I rarely ever see stuff marketed for them.\nThis combined with the fact that lots of people just use millenials as a a generic world for 'young ' people that a lot of times is just incorrect since they think any teen is a 'pffft millenial' when they clearly are not. Millenials are over colleg<b> e ag</b>e now and  Most  are pushing 30, or over it. Those kids doing fortnite dances and eating tide pods ARE NOT milleniialls, but people call them so regardless.\nThat other poster who said that its probably simply because Gen X were a less numerous generation is probably right, it's all down to marketing and numbers. Plus Gen Xs supposed cinism probably made them into a more 'lay low' generation naturally. I don't think grunge type people were trying to hog attention and would be  take selfies to put it on social media, quite the oppossite. Kurt Cobain would be vomiting at that thought... but that attention grabbing narcissitic nature is idiosincratic to both millenials and Gen Z, probably thanks to social media",

(Moreover, I watched a documentary about that, it said we were generation Z).\nIt depends on the person, some people of my <b> age </b>would say they're Millennials and they're right. In my case, I've seen Millennial  and Generation Z series, but I grown up with more technology than my older brother (he's 5 years older than me). And I've more younger friends (13,14,15years).\nIt's just... I don't see myself as a 1985's person XD. They're 33 years<b>  old</b> and I'm a childish teenager. \n\nAs we're a mixture, some people fit in Generation Z and another people fit in Millennials.\nSorry for my English :)",

I'm just barely a GenX'r yet I graduated 2 years early...if I graduated on time you'd have me in with millennials! My kids were born in 96 & 2000 respectively. Yet I was born 20 years after VE day in  WW2, with the day of my birth my only brother went off to fight in Vietnam...neither of which makes me a babyboomer! Or a Millennial! \nIt is my impression ( as well as how I was brought up with my peers ) I know more fit as a Boomer than I do a Millennial!\nIt seems to me the origin of Millennials\n keeps being pushed back to where many of these countries values started to go into chaos... Thereby shoving all of the discourse and responsibilities onto these bright, passionate young people who very well, given the chance and maybe a little direction could turn the \"America\" we have today back to the \" United States\" we all were once proud of.",

I happen to like Gen Z Culture and members more than Millenials but I do like the 2000's-Early 2010's more then the current life now so it's up to us to decide",

I especially loved Saturday mornings, watching Thundercats and Silverhawks (we also watched a lot of the cartoon classics from the 70s and earlier during that time), me and my cousins stuffing our faces with cereal and burning off our sugar high while watching Soul Train and playing outside afterward.  And you took me back with Video Soul.  I loved that, Video Vibrations, Rap City, and Yo MTV Raps too.",

Depends of perspective and point of view. Also many people were influence by their older siblings and grandparents.

Of course, we caused this. Our parents didn't throw us themed birthday parties or cherish our every word, so we wanted our children to have the childhood we never had. Hence, the Millennials were born. This is a generalization of course, but I recall childhood being miserable enough that I wanted to be an adult. I remember being ignored as a kid and how my opinions and desires didn't matter. How things have changed!",

I think everybody who doesn't remember the late 80s and very early 90s should be Millennials (AKA a world without The Simpsons or the USSR). I mean... I grew up watching The Transformers, GI Joe, Back to the Future, E.T., The Neverending Story, Poltergeist, Ghostbusters, Terminator, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, ALF, different strokes, Facts of Life, Who's the Boss, The X-Files, Family Ties and listening to Roxette, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Madonna, Guns 'N Roses, The Cure, R.E.M.",

I'm <b> old </b>school and grew up on cd players and mtv when it played music videos and without technology til i turned 18 and had my first AOL account and 56K dial up to go with it lol. I grew up on Nirvana, Alice in chains and and the whole grunge movement and post grunge ordeal. This video is so far off its not even funny. The first demographic i read awhile ago said Generation X is from 1965-1985 then Millennials 1986-1996 then Generation Z is 1997 til present day or Centennials whatever they call it. My point is you're totally correct though we definitely are Generation X or from now a new study says we're Xennials.. it's a micro generation that goes from 1977-1985. We're caught between gen X and Millennials. But again I do not relate with millennials as i'm sure you do not either.",

But I did remember listening to it to, and understanding how it evolved, since I am a born-and-raised New Yorker from Alphabet City. Even though I'm not into Hip hop many of my friends love it, and the genre has the best dance moves I have ever seen! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4c",

Millenial technology for the first consumer cellphone in 1983, & that required eliminating channels 70 - 83 from the UHF dial for cellphone use.  The first digital cellphone was millenial technology, & the current color screen cellphones, & smartphones are Gen Z technology.  USB drives I have considered Gen Z technology.  When that came out, & became affordable, I liked it (still like it) better than any floppy drive that came out.  Floppy disks are magnetized, and have to keep away from magnets.  5.25 inch disks were double sided, but hold very little in the way of data.  The 3.5 inch floppy disk is only 1 sided, & didn't hold that much more data.  The flap on the disk was to keep dust out, and prevent magnetizing the disk, but doubt that happened.\n\nAs for computers themselves, it's hard to say where each type of computer ranked in generations.  Computers as we know it have slowed down, & not advancing as much.  instead, computers themselves are being integrated into phones, some TV's (Smart TV's are not really  computers, but internet streaming TV's),  and sadly, even cars (as in to operate a car)",

The cartoons were Rocket Power, Rugrats, CatDog, and The Wild Thornberries... I'm from a generation that grew up watching Sesame Street, The Puzzle Place, Allegras Window, Gullah Gullah Island, and Bananas in Pajamas in the AM- and The Big Comfy Couch and Tiny Tots before bed \ud83d\udd25 Back in the day, kid's programming was LEGIT for kids! \nI remember the first episode of Sponge Bob... It had to grow on me at first tbh lol. I flipped back and forth to Disney that night, so I missed parts and the next day, everybody at school was talking about it and I was like \"huh?!\"",

                    "commentText": "The term \"Lost Generation\" is misleading to many. Originally the term \"lost generation\" was used to describe the children left behind in Europe after WW1 or the Great War, as the Europeans call it. Between 1914, after the war, and the early 1920s children were very scarce in some countries. Since then the \"Lost Generation\" has been overly used by popular culture to describe children left behind by working class families, also know as \"latch key kids,\" during the late 1950s and 60s. During the late 70s and 80s the term changed, used by then elders before the baby boomers, to meaning \"hopeless generation\" describing the children of drugged out hippies. Today the term \"Lost Generation\" is overly used by an older generation to vilify or to put down a younger group. This type of bullying has no place in our current society. One would as to stop using this dated term.",

            "commentText": "I'm a Gen Z person/Centennial! I was born December 28, 2000. My parents are from Gen Y, and most of my half-siblings are Millennials. \n\nDespite the fact that the younger people are from Gen Z, I've noticed a lot of differences between people born in my year and people born a few years after. Although I can't remember 9/11 despite being alive, me and my peers have grown up with 90's and early 2000's cartoons, and relate more with late 1990's people as a result. The majority of people my friends and I have met that are a few years younger than us seem to have a different attitude and approach to social situations like school. While most high schoolers aren't very respectful to begin with, each new class of students gets worse in the behavioral sense. I'm not saying this is the case of everyone, but based on the majority of the freshman during my <b> Senior </b>year of high school, they seem to think they're entitled to acting<b>  crazy</b>, that they don't have to have manners, and thinking they're better than everyone. I don't know if it's because of the influence of the louder and more disrespectful individuals that are in my class, but it's sad either way.\n\nSorry for rambling, I wanted to notice the differences I've seen despite the closeness i<b> n ag</b>e. I can't believe that my class in going into college already. As this new generation grows up, a new one will eventually be born. Only time can tell how they'll be, huh?",

Its because of illegal immigrants that we haven't seen raises like we should. We have a competing work force that accepts lower wages and doesn't pay taxes yet its trumps fault? It democrats policies that have you struggling not the economy and not the president. The economy is good because we have the lowest unemployment rate ever and our GDP is at an all time high. You want those raises, build the wall and quit screaming for more illgals and open borders. Its really that simple. Get rid of that competing work force and your employers will be force to pay you more.",

There are lazy, entitled and nasty people and there are respectful, humble, hardworking people in every generation. One thing I will say is that you would think millennials would have been taught to have the same core values as their parents. I know I was and a lot of my friends were. We were taught to work for what we want, to be respectful and to remain humble.  If your child can't even be respectful then you failed them. I know plenty of people who had parents that gave them everything they wanted and are now entitled, as parents you need to set boundaries with your children and set them up to be successful at a young <b> age.</b> Teach your kids what you know instead of complaining about them. With the new<b>  age</b> of technology, we need each other. I have to ask people a few years younger than me how to do stuff because it's so hard to keep up with the times. My parents taught me how to balance checkbooks, write checks, etc. I taught myself how to invest, I set myself up with an IRA and learned to spread my wealth on my own. I try to teach what I know to others so that they can set themselves up for success as well. I knew that I didn't want to struggle in life so I did what I could to set myself up for success at a youn<b> g ag</b>e. However, I am still like most millennials, I have debt, but I work hard for everything that I have and work to pay it off. There is research to backup Jenny's claims, I'm not sure about the economy part. It's easy to discredit the struggles a generation is going through because you went through times that you believe were harder. Things were hard for each generation in different aspects.",

Fact of the matter is that in general the USA is known for its \"me me me\" attitude. Your education, health care, and housing is overly expensive and your wages don't increase with inflation as they should. You're okay with people working jobs below minimum wage because if their wage would increase it could mean that you'd have to pay a couple more dollars on your bill. You don't want minimum wage to increase because \"a burger flipper shouldn't make a living wage, it's a student job after all and you shouldn't stay in that job your entire life\" even though those may be the only jobs a person has access to. You don't want a single payer health care system because \"why should I have to pay for your illness\" disregarding the fact that it would end up being cheaper then having to pay for insurance dispite taxes being increased by a couple %. But you're okay with the fact that a single illness that's beyond  your control can mean you lose everything you've worked for your entire life. In the meanwhile a huge portion of your taxes are spent on the military, in order to fight wars you shouldn't be fighting, invade other countries for their recourses, and in general stick your nose into businesses it doesn't belong in. \n\nYou can blame other generations, you can blame illegal immigrants, you can blame Trump, and Obama. But if the attitude of the country would change to a more social approach instead of \"me me me and my wallet\" and if you'd cut back on your military expenses (might be difficult now that you've made plenty of enemies around the world) your country could be so much better than it is now. A booming economy is not working if only the top 1% feels it, a booming  economy isn't beneficial untill all layers of society benefit from it.",

So, it's actually one of the rare opinions that actually DO matter to others.  The area of responsibility that you have shown yourself to be lacking in with your comment is summarily that you haven't put much thought or educated yourself about how the government and world works. To put it simply-when a president comes into power, they can't immediately affect change. In fact it's hard for some to affect any large, tangible (to the general public) changes in their first term.  So when you attribute the current economy to Trump, you are making it glaringly obvious that you were not paying any real attention to politics or the economy trends before Trump got into office, and you probably still aren't...But if you feel that you have been wrongly accused here, the best way for you to school me is to tell me what he has done to make the economy the way it currently is, and if you could explain how i'm wrong that the economy was already in recovery from Obama, who left office, but anything he put into action didn't go home. It kept doing what it was intended to do, and Trump just hasn't been able to ruin it because our gov't is designed with a system of checks and balances. .",

The difference between us and the generations around us is this: the generation before us thinks respect is forced through domination, power, and control. The generation after us thinks respect is a given and is super offended if you don't behave the way they feel you should. Our generation, however, is more about obeying obvious social protocol and otherwise just letting each other be their selves. Big difference. But because we don't make a stink about it like the two surrounding generations and don't try to impose our own personal view of how we want respect given and aren't as controlling and demanding about getting respect bc we are more comfortable just letting everyone be their self, people think we aren't about being respectful as much as other generations. <b> Common </b>misconception. \ud83d\ude18\u2728",

I'm off to making the comment to my girls that are 23 and 14 years <b> old </b>but I am so glad that I did not grow up with all of this technology. I get a lot of questions about what did you do before Google. I just laugh and tell him how easy it is for you to find out things now as it was not so easy back then. There's definitely pros and cons to each generation. But I will say that I am so glad I was the baby of the 80s! No better decade and definitely no better music than back then!  Good job bright side!",

My teenage years, though, were the emergence of the tech boom. I got my first cellphone at <b> age </b>13 and it wasn't even a flip phone! It was a brick with everything on the front. My family got our 1st computer when I was 8 [because my bro is gen x and was into electronics]  and I remember It had a total hard drive space of around 2-3GB. For 1998 that wasn't actually too bad. A \"good\" computer could have as much as 6 to 8! A supercomputer top of the line MIGHT have 16. \nCheck out this article written in 1999 about computer harddrive space, it's hilarious. \"by year 2000 we expect to have 25-30GB drives for around $200!!!\" \n [LINK] ",

When I was a kid in 1984, we got our first computer (an <b> Apple </b>IIc) and I started learning computer programming.  We had computers in school also and experienced boomers trying to teach computers when the kids knew 1000 times more about them. Yes it wasn't as advanced as computers now but we used to be able to access the base programming, alter it, and write our own programs. It was more fun than being locked out and having software control everything. We had internet access at home and school in 1991.",

If you were to define generations your way, then actual generations wouldn't even be close to keeping up with the dates of the actual generations. A generation is a group of people a similar <b> age </b>who have similar experiences and living conditions. It has<b>  nothing</b> to do with your parents. Besides, literally every source or whatever suggests or outright says that Millenials' children are going to be Generation Alpha while children of Gen X parents are from Gen Z.",

We like to shame people who disagree with us, we have a weak understanding of how the world really works, no understanding of history, politics or economics, only what fits into our ideology. Its good that the new generation look like they will be the opposite to us but unfortunately because of us we have created future problems that the new generation will have to pay and fix. Speaking as a Millenial I am so sorry.",

You have Generation Y people in their 30's that had a very different upbringing compared to that early 20's crowd, The media never focuses on Generation Y or millennials that work 2 or 3 jobs, served in the military, working the farm or whatever else because that's not the sexy story.",

I actually find most of the negative stereotypes people have of us come from those who think these 22 and unders are millenials and are using what they see in gen z to classify us.  Psychologists have even noticed that millenials and gen z have very different social media patterns with us having less accounts than gen z....prob cuz we were born in a world without social media!!!",

Gen-X is relatively small comparative to the Boomer generation. The Boomers were the ones who were able to graduate high school and get a job that could support themselves without going on to further education.  They're more likely to think that millennials aren't applying themselves when looking for jobs or thinking that avocado toast is the reason that they're not buying homes. (really?) Anyway, Gen-X is the first generation to follow the Baby Boomers who did not get the same economic advantages that the Boomers got. Also got called entitled and lazy after graduating college/university and having to work low paying jobs because those were the jobs that happened to be hiring at the time. Meanwhile it was the corporations that were sending the jobs offshore. Considering that very few Gen-Xers at the time were seated on the board of directors of these corporations I doubt Gen-X were the 'selfish pricks\" who made those decisions Django Marine.",

For example, a kid born in 94 and a kid born in 95 are friends growing up, they share similar values and concepts, similar experience in life. They grow up, are still in touch, but find themselves having more in <b> common </b>with peers a year older/younger than their cusp friend. 94 kid finds his new friend born in 95 shares more of his views etc. While the same is true for 94 kid finding more things in<b>  common</b> with his 93 friend. Of course, this is all on averages for mass scale, and there will always be outliers, and more of them regarding cusps. This is just how the cookie crumbles for modern generations, where behavior and observable change is increasing each year thus resulting in much more frequent and more dramatic generation transitions.",

I do apologise as it was never my intention to offend or look down upon any generation.  In fact, it was the opposite.  You must have not learned about Socrates yet.  He was one of the most famous philosophers ever.  I was attempting to use his quote to underscore the fact that every generation is guilty of looking down on the ones that follow.  However, apparently you are an exception.  As am I.  You appear to be close in <b> age </b>with my grandchildren.  It is my belief that every generation has great strength...as well as weakness.  As we all do.  I should have been clear that they were not my words.  You express yourself very well and I am impressed.  Keep it up and you will go far in life.  Have a great day/night guys and gals.",

All because things like canned biscuits came out and people no longer had to cook for hours! \n\nMy grandma on my mom's side worried about my mom becoming lazy because they had washers and dryers in homes and she'd never understand the value of hard work. \n\nEvery generation will complain about the newer generation. I was born in 89. My daughter is almost 3 and she already knows how to work a tablet better than I do. And of course I've said, 'I'm worried she's going to be entitled, and demand instant gratification!' Haha we all do it. As technology gets more advanced, aspects of life become easier (which is amazing). But for those of us who knew life before (insert item here), we become fixed on what we know and have experienced. We can't understand yet how huge changes will affect future generations. But the truth is is that it doesn't do any harm. People will always have to work for a living. We may not have to work as hard, but that's a good thing. I'm thankful that my child won't have to drop out of middle school to take over the family farm like my grandpa did. All generations will complain about something. One day generation Z will complain about the new kids on the block \ud83d\ude02 what we need to do is realize that these labels don't really mean much, and have the maturity to open our eyes and realize that everything in life is about perception.",

I grew up playing gamecube on an 18 square inch portable TV with a built-in VCR that my parents bought for my brother and I to watch movies in the car (before DVD players were a feature cars came with, y'know? Did cars even have built-in VHS players?). I also moved around a lot and lived in the middle of nowhere for quite a while, so I might blame that for my early-year technological incompetence XD My Gen X parents raised us listening to John Legend, the Police and Fleetwood Mac, so I'd like to think I appreciate the music's \"golden years\" along with the new-age current stuff. I didn't get my first smartphone until I went to Europe in my junior year of high school, and didn't own a laptop newer than 2003 until college XD",
