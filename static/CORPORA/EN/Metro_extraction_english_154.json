        "postText": "A charity supporting rape victims say they have received \u2018abusive phone calls\u2019 after Tommy Robinson shared a picture of their leaflet.', 'The Rape Crisis pamphlet addressed black, Asian and minority ethnic women who had experienced sexual violence and urged them to seek support.', 'It then offered a phone number, telling victims that Punjabi, Hindi and English support workers are available.', 'Far-right campaigner Robinson shared the leaflet on his Facebook page on February 14, writing: \u2018I guess it\u2019s ok to rape white women then?\u2019', 'Rape Crisis Wycombe, Chiltern and South Bucks said that since then they have had a \u2018significant volume of abusive phone calls, messages and emails\u2019, many of which were of a \u2018overtly racist nature\u2019.', 'Workers have reported the incident to police and slammed the callers for \u2018disrupting much-needed service provision for victims and survivors of sexual violence\u2019.', '\u2018Rape Crisis (Wycombe, Chiltern and South Bucks) recognises that some groups of women who have survived sexual violence and abuse can face additional barriers to accessing services, including related to language and to the fear and/or past or current experience of racism and racial discrimination,\u2019 the charity said in a statement.', '\u2018As part of its commitment to accessibility and inclusion, it therefore offers a specialist service for black, Asian and minority ethnic women aimed at overcoming some of these barriers.\u2019', 'The charity blamed Robinson\u2019s \u2018misleading caption\u2019 on social media for the torrent of abusive messages and calls.', 'It added: \u2018Rape Crisis England & Wales supports Rape Crisis (Wycombe, Chiltern and South Bucks) and all its member Rape Crisis Centres in the provision of fully inclusive, accessible services, including specialist work with specific groups of under-served, minoritised or marginalised victims and survivors.\u2019', 'Some of Robinson\u2019s one million followers had commented on the picture of the leaflet calling it \u2018horrendous\u2019, \u2018discriminative\u2019 and \u2018out of order\u2019.', 'One wrote: \u2018Think we all need to phone the numbers advertised & put in a racist complaint.\u2019', '\u2018Is it our turn to play the racist card now,\u2019 another added.', 'But some Facebook commentators did defend the charity, writing: \u2018Good grief, It\u2019s an additional phone line.', '\u2018Tommy doesn\u2019t seem to understand, or want to understand, that there is a cultural stigma that brings shame on both the victims and their families so they are less likely to report it.', '\u2018The helpline is English, Hindi and Punjabi and operated by a worker who understands those particularly difficulties.\u2019', 'Another said: \u2018It\u2019s a specialist line with experienced and trained translators. Hardly rocket science.\u2019', 'Robinson told Metro.co.uk he had \u2018asked a valid question\u2019 as \u2018the poster excluded white people which is becoming more frequent\u2019.', '\u2018I asked a question \u2013 it was not a call to action and I did not ask anyone to contact the organisation,\u2019 he said.', '\u2018If anyone has harassed the organisation then that is 100% wrong.\u2019",

Every single article ever written about him starts with the almost Tourettes like ''Former leader of the EDL Tommy Robinson, also known as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon......'' so what, EXACTLY, are you talking about when you state he 'hides' his name.Don't worry, I know accountability and logic won't be your things so not expecting any sort of cogent reply. Maybe just play the victim because I called you a dickhead but......you ARE a dickhead.Who exactly is ''attacking'' the charity? Has there ever been a left-wing narrative that you won't unquestioningly climb aboard? There is one phone line - where is the evidence for ANYONE having ''clogged it up'' (another narrative eagerly swallowed - I must have read it 20 times). Calling a charity out for focusing on the colour or <b> ethnicity </b>of rape victims when it should be entirely irrrelevant to the issue isn't ''attacking'' anyone no matter how you try to spin it into victimhood....it's just not. It's a stupid, divisive idiotic thing to do.",

A far-right activist called Stephen Yaxley-Lennon wouldn't be taken seriously, so he picked a name that made him sound working class. It doesn't matter that we know his birth name, he continues to use his chosen name, and hide his former identity behind his new one. Unless you're saying he greets new people with \"I'm Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, but everyone calls me Tommy Robinson.\", which would be ridiculous. For someone who claims they have read this story \"20 times\", you seem to have missed this paragraph; \"Rape Crisis Wycombe, Chiltern and South Bucks said that since then they have had a \u2018significant volume of abusive phone calls, messages and emails\u2019, many of which were of a \u2018overtly <b> racist </b>nature\u2019.\" This would be the unnamed people attacking the charity, although you probably call it \"fair criticism\". This particular poster was created to highlight a specialist helpline for women who might not use English as a first language, or who may not feel comfortable talking to a white person about suffering rape, thanks to all the anti-immigrant rhetoric going around at the moment. Finally, you can call me a dickhead all you want. I've been called worse, and for so long that insults no longer bother me. I wonder if your parents are disappointed in you. They should be. To the point they regret your existence.",

Metro, nor any other news outlet, is required to provide \"exact numbers\" in their reports. The figure likely stayed between the charity, and the police, so Metro printed the information they had, and printing a figure not provided to them would be falsifying information, and then someone would go to jail for it. Stupidly expecting them to have such information gives you your second strike. Finally, believing what Tommy Robinson says, and then demanding Metro show evidence, is hypocritical, and<b>  dumb</b>, not recognising he's clearly backtracking after being caught making a huge mistake, claiming he's defended himself, and \"shot down the article\" based on his insistence that his question was valid, gives you strikes three through six. So basically, well done for making yourself look incredibly stupid, and then doubling up on your stupidity.",
