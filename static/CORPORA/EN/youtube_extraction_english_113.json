She should have died a natural death in a couple of years but was deliberately forced to remain barely alive with adrenalin shots and other forced things.    Normally this racket would have let her die when the money ran out, but a Hospice doctor came to this luxury place and happened to see her tied up.  He examined her and said she should have passed away 2 or 3 years before.   He had her placed i Hospice where she passed away.\nThis medical kidnapping is <b> common </b>when there is an estate.    My father left his entire fortune to her with my brother as power of attorney.   My Dad thought money could secure her with good care...please, if you read this....money can't guarantee much in this world accept the friendship of those you help with it...Jesus said that.   No institution can be trusted.   If you have anyone you love in a home, a school, or anyplace....show up often in person...be a nuisance.    Thank the Lord for that Hospice doctor.",

Understand you've already lived through certain experiences meanwhile a child is new to the world and barely beginning to understand the world. Love goes beyond the depths of what we think we comprehend. Love is more than \"I provided you with food and shelter\". I am only sharing my own opinion from personal experiences. I understand we all have different backgrounds and I will always acknowledge there are those less fortunate than me. I just know certain things weren't right when I was growing up.",

But when their family did visit, the light and joy that shone from their faces was worth all the sadness I felt for them. Sure you are told not to get attached to your clients, but I wouldn't have wanted to do a job caring for<b>  old</b> people if I didn't feel it in me to care and that they matter. They were less concerned about their ailments than not having family around.",

            "commentText": "My mom just passed last week but she did so at home with my father and I holding her hands till her last breaths when she died peacefully in her deep sleep with her loved ones by her side as it should be. Six years ago she was given only months to live but she defied the <b> doctors </b>and defied the odds and stuck around and mainly because she was loved and cared for by our family. My father and I took care of her and had to learn to deal with an amputee with dementia .We had a care giver come over during the week but not round the clock care . After 6 years we were tired and my mom had started getting worse with congestive heart failure and her diabetes was getting bad along with her kidneys failing finally after having to deal with a UTI and a C-diff infection . Her body just couldn't fight back anymore . After her last trip to the hospital they gave her only 24 hours to live and we wanted her to pass at home but the hospital fought us .They said provided she makes it through the night maybe they'll release her to us . She managed to hold out another three days without food or water or anything else at all,which gave us precious time to get her back home to die with dignity and respect with her family by her side .\n A social worker who only worked one Saturday a month just happened to be working that day after she was given one day to live and got her released for us .We lucked out in that way and my mom fought to give us this time . Putting her in a nursing home was never an option for us .She had been in one for a while while recovering from major surgery following an amputation 6 years prior and was always getting ill or infections and hated being there .\nAs soon as we were able to get her out we did so . Things have to change with our society and we should honor our parents wishes as they did for their children . I realize not all situations are the same and some just don't have the option to do this as we did . It's because of love for her we fought so hard and sacrificed so much and made this happen because she would have done the same for any of us . Love can be an amazing power . I'm convinced that love alone kept her going when all others gave up on her . She passed a day prior to Mr. Stephen Hawking a great physics professor and another fighter who defied the odds and persisted . \nWe picked up her ashes today and brought her back home where she belongs which was her wish .\nPerhaps it's just me but I truly believe love is what matters the most in this world of ours and that everything else is negotiable but not all that important in the grand scheme of things . We get too hung up on trivial nonsense and forget why we're all here . Fortunately I was raised to see what matters the most and to cherish what life can be. My mother pounded that into my head ! Lol \nMay she rest in peace 12/21/41 to 3/12/18 \ud83d\ude22",

            "commentText": "The thing is, these materialistic and greedy mindset has pervaded the western culture and in turns, corrupted their family value. Children were forced out of their home to seek out their fortune by any means necessary with no cares of who they'll hurt, as if they're still stuck in a colonial era. Generations after generations, parents never taught their children first how to be a decent human being to his fellow man. Instead, they keeps breeding the selfish, uncaring, unattaching attitude into their sons and their son's son. In the end, the children lose the capability to respect and love, not only to fellow man but to their parents as well. A pitiful cycle.\n\n Finding a person to blame will not stop this downward spiral. This ice cold barrier of apathy can only be thaw with warm heart of man. Start respect and love your elders. Set yourself as an example for your children to see what its like to be a human, not a machined cog in the wheel of cold, uncarring system. So one day they would love you back the same way.",
