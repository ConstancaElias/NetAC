        "postText": "The perception of black hair has seemingly come a long way in recent years.', 'When I was growing up in the 90s and noughties, short sleek haircuts with finger waves and long weaves seemed like the only hairstyles that black women could wear, that were also accepted by society.', 'Afros were still seen as unkempt and unprofessional, while cornrows were synonymous with the word \u2018ghetto.\u2019', 'Now, thanks to the internet and social media,I, along with many other black women, have learned to embrace my afro with confidence.', 'It would be easy to believe that employers have become more accepting of black hairstyles, but discrimination still exists.', 'A few days ago, a story emerged of Cheyanne Arnold, a 22-year-old student in Birmingham who had recently applied for a role with TempTribe, a hospitality staff supplier based in London. Arnold was rejected for the position because she wore dreadlocks, and that particular hairstyle did not comply with the company\u2019s standards.', 'She even found a presentation guide for workers that banned employees from wearing braids and dreadlocks.', 'Unfortunately, Arnold is not the first black woman to be rejected for a job because of a hairstyle that didn\u2019t conform to white beauty standards.', 'Last year, it was revealed that a black woman seeking a job at Harrods via an external job agency was told to chemically straighten her afro for the role, in order to look professional.', 'In 2015, Lara Odoffin had her job application withdrawn, due to refusing to take out her braids.', 'On a positive note, social media platforms dedicated to black hair, and YouTubers who deliver masterclasses on how to style afros and braids, have caused a seismic shift in the beauty industry\u2019s attitude towards black hair.', 'This has resulted in more product choice for women who want to show off their hair\u2019s natural texture, and more black women with afros featured in beauty campaigns.', 'But the change in attitude is undoubtedly also due to more black celebrities such as Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Solange Knowles proudly wearing their afros and braids on the red carpet.', 'I felt amazing as I watched YouTube clips of Maria Borges when she became the first black supermodel to walk the Victoria\u2019s Secret runway with natural hair.', 'I felt a sense of pride as I saw Serena Williams\u2019 long-length braids sway in the light breeze and accessorised with a peach fascinator at the Royal Wedding.', 'I felt joy when Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2019s afro glistened as she walked onto the stage to receive her Academy Award in 2014.', 'But, as much as I am in awe of these hair choices, incidents such as Arnold\u2019s ordeal remind me that society accepts black hairstyles on these famous black women because they have bank accounts and accolades that transcend the redundant notion that certain black hairstyles are unrefined.', 'It\u2019s as though these hairstyles are great for fashion photo shoots, beauty campaigns and runways, because they fit a certain aesthetic for a brief moment in time. Black hairstyles are still treated as novelty looks and costumes that are appropriate for the cameras.', 'Yet, in everyday life, black women like myself go through a constant internal battle of whether we should or shouldn\u2019t wear the styles that suit the very hair texture that grows from our heads, because our choices could threaten our livelihood.', 'With workplaces viewing black hair in a derogatory manner and forcing black women to wear weaves and use chemical straightening products known as relaxers, we also need to understand that these racist beauty standards are affecting the physical health of black women.', 'It\u2019s no secret that both relaxers and weaves can lead to hair loss, but a recent study also shows that harmful ingredients within relaxers are linked to cancer, hormone disruption and reproductive damage.', 'It\u2019s beyond unfair that black women who work in 9 to 5 jobs need to put their health on the line in order to gain work.', 'While I have been blessed to never have faced workplace discrimination due to my hair choices, I did however once take out my braids days before an interview for an internship. I did it so I\u2019d have enough time to install a straight weave for my potential employers.', 'But then again, I\u2019ve spent the majority of my career working as a freelancer, so unlike many other black women, I\u2019ve never had to worry if my hair looks white enough.', 'With Arnold the latest in a long line of black women to have lost out on employment for wearing hairstyles such as braids and dreadlocks, I\u2019ve been forced to have a brutal conversation with myself on how much progress society has really made in terms of the attitude towards black women\u2019s hair.', 'If acceptance of afros and dreadlocks hasn\u2019t filtered down to black women who, like me, work everyday jobs in offices or occupy service-based roles, then maybe we haven\u2019t changed the perception of black hair as much as we thought.",

I hope one day soon the natural hairstyles and just the natural hair growing from our heads can be accepted, rather than evaluated under the white gaze.
