        "postText": "A primary school has decided not to teach lessons about LGBT rights and homophobia after parents protested outside the school gates.', 'Parkfield Community School suspended the No Outsiders programme after parents reportedly withdrew 600 pupils from lessons on Friday.', 'Before the suspension of lessons, Alum Rock Community Forum accused the school of \u2018undermining parental rights and aggressively promoting homosexuality\u2019 and said \u2018dialogue, petitioning and protests by parents have been repeatedly and arrogantly ignored\u2019.', 'The school denied it had U-turned on the decision and told the BBC the No Outsiders programme is still an \u2018integral part of its ethos\u2019.', 'Friday was the culmination of weekly protests at the primary school, which has about 740 pupils aged three to 11.', 'Deputy head and author of No Outsiders, Andrew Moffat MBE, has reportedly had death threats as well as being nominated for the world\u2019s best teacher.', 'The school sent a letter to parents confirming the protests had been successful, The Guardian reported.', 'The letter said: \u2018Up to the end of this term, we will not be delivering any No Outsiders lessons in our long-term year curriculum plan, as this half term has already been blocked for religious education (RE).', 'It added: \u2018Equality assemblies will continue as normal and our welcoming No Outsiders ethos will be there for all.\u2019', 'The move came after Andrew Warren, the regional schools commissioner for the West Midlands, along with parents, the trust, and Liam Byrne MP, held a meeting and decided a full consultation was needed.', 'Last month Metro.co.uk reported how an angry mob picketed the school in Saltley and left Mr Moffat feeling \u2018very threatened\u2019.', 'The cief inspector of Ofsted Amanda Spielman has repeatedly backed the school in teaching about LGBT issues, she said children needed \u2018to know about families that have two mummies or two daddies\u2019.",
