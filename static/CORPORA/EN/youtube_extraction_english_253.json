America, thousands of years ago, was formed under life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We don't have that anymore. Now, all you see is our families getting killed, beaten, or jailed because of how we look. The superstitions are not always true. People of color are just as human and just as good of people as whites. It's sad that this young girl is so understanding of the unfair racial treatment and is having to live through this with tears and pain.",

It truly is absolutely heartbreaking, as she so strongly shows. Every community is praying that it comes to an end!",

Like I'm actually Muslim but people make memes about our God and it upsets me. I think my school treat my unfairly because I'm Muslim.. Like I kicked a ball and got in trouble but a Christian boy kicked one and he was not in trouble. I have anger issues so when I hurt someone I got detention but a girl who swore at me didnt even the teacher heard. Muslim&Blacks need rights fast..",

Two sides debating an issue that should be and is over with (atleast where i live). However the issue still rages on. Why am i commenting you ask? Well because im sick of this entire issue. Humans are quite the trivial species we continue to do stupid shit despite it not working. Were an insane species. \n\n1. Every <b> race:</b<b> >black</b>, white, asian, hispanic, etc can be rascist. \n2. There are laws in place that make rascism illegal. However theres also a thing called freedom of speech. So if someone makes a crack at you<b> r rac</b>e its on their conscience. The only true time it should matter is when they tread upon your human rights. People say stupid shit. Debate what they say in a civilized manner. (It makes your cause appear more worthy and thus attract more individuals) or dont debate at all and continue on with life. \n<b> 3. bla</b>ck lives do matter. But so do all lives. \n4. Dont play the victim card. Your ancestors were treated as slaves. However so were alot of peoples. Remember them but dont play it as if your ancestors are you. You and them are seperate individuals. Unless YOU were abused physically to the extent they were then you have no right to say we have been slaving for the white man. Etc.etc. because you havnt.\n5. Feel free to dispute my points. Just do it civilized im sick of petty arguments. Humans need to wise up before were our own undoing....\n\nThe girls brave. I dont know what shes seen (or if shes just been told what to say. unfortunately in our world some parents are just sick enough to do that) what i do know is that was brave. She gets a plus one for her bravery.",

We've seen this on news how they through bricks , Mess up cars, call police Killers just because they are doing their job. This knowledge doesn't make sense to me.  You don't want a<b>  race</b> war but go ahead and attack white police men for no reason? not all White people ar<b> e racis</b>t and not all White police men are here to kill. Instead of attacking innocent White People , Think about how That'll make t<b> he Bla</b>ck life's matter movement look. All life's have the same value and no one's life is greater than anyone else\n\n#alllifesmatter",

By pounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by the Whites we can mould them to our program. The terms \"Colonialism\" and \"Imperialism\" must be featured in our propaganda. In America we will aim for subtle victory while inflaming the <b> Negro </b>minority against the Whites, we will endeavour to Instill in Whites a guilt complex for exploiting the Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise to prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sport and entertainment. With this prestige, the Negroes will be able to intermarry with the Whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause.\"",

I can't go school without a student treating me differently to their white frineds. I can't remember the last time i didn't have to think about why the white kid next to me thinks im not smart or a normal human just like him/her.\n\nSorry if i offended anyone with MY opinion but I'm just stating fact, real life and my everyday experience. \n\nWho ever is reading this i dont care who you are...If your a boy, girl, trans<b> , lesbia</b><b> n, <b> g</b</b><b> >ay,</b><b>  fat, s</b>kinny, ugly, pretty, <b> smart</b>, dumb, poor, rich, muslim, christian, hindu, seek, <b> jewish, </b>african<b> , asian</b>, indian, jamacan, austrailian, american, English, Scottish or anything else...i just want you to know your special and you should make other feel like that too!",

Ask yourself:\nDo these people, when they die, take the skin color, the organs, the eyes with them? The answer is no.\nWhen they have diarrhea, halitosis, vomits is that different? Does it smell different?\nWhat will they take with them when they'll die? The answer is \"their spirit.\"\nSo we are not our skin color, hair, blood, organs (by the way, they look alike, only compatibilities differ to save each other's lives. It may be that Whites save Blacks and vice versa). All this will stay in the coffin and be food for larvae. WE ARE SPIRIT.\nIf you can tell God to make it clearer in your mind, you no longer need to feel different or inferior. Keep it in your mind.\nGod bless you.",

We have reasons to act or do something. Our looks or skin Doesn't identify who we Are. Nor do our friends. I Can't Stand it when people dont understand that America Is not just white people it is a Mixture of everything. It's a free country so we can do what we want and speak what we want. If your gonna be like ' OH YOU ARE BEING RUDE BECAUSE YOUR TALKING TRASH ABOUT ME IN MEXICAN LANGUAGE!' first think! America is a MIX OF DIFFERENT RACES WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FREE it's not just English it's Portugal Spanish Arabic Chinese Dutch etc; Our world already has enough problems and I think that being Nice and equal is the easiest thing to do to make the world a better place.",

Why. Why does it always boil back down t<b> o blac</b>k slavery. If I could stop it I would back in history with a time machine, but we can't.

Secondly,  international trade is the whole reason why many countries in Africa who supports free trade moves out of poverty. Moreover, getting our factories abroad not only is cost efficient, it also provides many opportunities for local residence in Africa. Due to the fact that our factories provide machines that will increase productivity, which will increase the wages of workers. On top of that, international trade also gives Africans a bigger market which will provide them with an opportunity to sell goods to other countries. Finally, more competitors means more goods and better quality of goods for consumers all around the world.",

She needs to be shown facts, facts like the truth! Truth that she is more likely to be murdered by someone of her own skin color than a white person. Fact that she will not spend a day in jail if she does not commit a crime.  Fact that if she keeps cracking them books she can go to college and be whatever she wishes in our great country! Fact that it's not donald Trump or some other white man keeping her down, it's her own people keeping her down. Telling her she doesn't have as much privledge and that she has to try harder to make it in \"white America\".",

Perspective can be changed with education, not ignorance. There's a direct correlation with living in poverty and violence. That has  more to do with lack of opportunity, police-profiling, means, poor public schooling, incarceration for non-violent offenses, and overall environment. I'd recommend reading Cory Booker's \"United\" for some perspective on this from Cory's time in Newark, NJ.",

And 'Blame' is the wrong term to use when you're in our shoes. Clearly we're not playing the blame game since we're the ones that are trying to change and take a knee during the stupid national anthem and protest and say<b>  black</b> lives matter too. Oh yeah that's reaaally blaming white people. Give me a break<b> . Blac</b>k people don't complain about anything. Hell we don't complain ENOUGH cause y'all still treating us like we're not equals when we all ble<b> ed <b> r</b</b>>ed. Yet you say we're the ones that should be complaining' about what? Due to the privilege that you've been born with what is there to complain about? Blacks and Latinos have been treated like we're the lowest species in<b>  the na</b>tion yet you think you should be complaining?! Wow you're really full of it but you know what? It's ok though cause we're living in the last stages on earth and the most high sees everything. He's been watching the way blacks have been treated and he got us right under his thumb. Come judgment day you're gonna feel so guilty but there won't be anywhere for you to hide cause the dark will come to light, soon you'll see.",

Also, 28% of freed <b> African </b>Americans(at slavery's peak) owned slaves, so they shouldn't be totally blaming white people. What we did was terrible, and I'm not trying to justify that, but we shouldn't be held accountable for our ancestors sins. That's like if my great great grandpa killed someone, should I have to serve jail time for him? Also,<b>  black</b> people have the same rights as everyone else, and although they still may be overall more impoverished, we have worked to give them equal(or more) opportunities, like with Affirmative actions.

Rather than accepting that police officers are here to \"serve and PROTECT\" ALL people! They're shouldn't be ANY cases of police officers murdering anyone because it's specifically their job to protect and not destroy . Random <b> Black </b>people aren't employed by the government and in such authority when they kill each other just like with the white community committing mass murder which no one seems to point out .",
