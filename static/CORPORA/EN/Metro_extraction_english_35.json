        "postText": "My name is Stacey Clare and for over 12 years I have worked as a stripper. I\u2019m also a feminist.', 'The fact that these two features of my life may seem completely incongruous and out-of-step to some women, and yet so obviously compatible to others, reflects the ongoing deep divides within the gender equality movement over the sex industry.', 'As 21st century feminism advances through the #MeToo movement and the Time\u2019s Up campaign, unless we can have meaningful, circumspect and evidence-based dialogue around the facts and lived experiences of sex work, this discord will only become more uncomfortable.', 'All too often, the subject is hijacked by hysteria and stereotyping, making such conversation impossible and counter-productive.', 'I have identified as a feminist for as long as I have been a stripper. I began dancing as a student to pay my way through higher education, which nowadays is an expensive pursuit.', 'My own alignment as a feminist is based on a woman\u2019s right to choose.', '\u2018My body, my choice\u2019 sounds like an obvious paradigm, but it shouldn\u2019t be underestimated how fundamental it is to the feminist movement.', 'The right to bodily autonomy is what gave women access to safe abortion and birth control.', 'It therefore seems contrary for one woman to campaign against another woman\u2019s right to agency over her own body. We shouldn\u2019t get to cherry-pick which groups have the right to which freedoms, we either all have it or we don\u2019t.', 'But of course, I get it. It\u2019s on the question of genuine agency that we all fall down. Do strippers really have agency in a job where they have virtually no employment security or workers\u2019 rights?', 'There isn\u2019t a stripper in the UK who will claim there are no problems with the way sexual entertainment venues are run. I\u2019ve worked in clubs that are incredibly unfair to their female workers.', 'Equality of the sexes when the economy of a strip club is stacked against the predominantly female workforce and in favour of the venue operators (the majority of whom are male) is a running joke.', 'But this is not a unique problem to our workplaces. Current UK regulations fail self-employed contractors in many industries, with gig economy workers being exploited in droves.', 'Plumbers, delivery drivers, cleaners, and security workers have all joined the battle against exploitative business practices over recent years. And if the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up campaigns have revealed anything, it\u2019s that sexism is not limited to my industry, but an endemic problem that women in all areas of society face daily.', 'Throughout my dancing career, I have worked in a range of venues, from high-end \u2018classy\u2019 establishments, to more down-to-earth bars.', 'I found myself working in The White Horse, a traditional East London boozer, for a few years, run by a family of women. Working conditions there were surprisingly amenable to the dancers, but in 2016 it closed due to the relentless gentrification of Shoreditch.', 'One night, a feminist customer took up camp at the bar, and after a couple of hours glowering at the dancers and staff she decided to \u2018stand up\u2019 for the sisterhood.', 'Having identified the female business owner, she started yelling accusations of trafficking, pimping, exploitation and abuse.', 'As she was being escorted outside by security, she even went in for a physical assault on our boss, managing a slap in her face before being booted off the premises.', 'This is a classic example of feminism in crisis. Had this moral crusader bothered to stop and ask us about our experiences, she may have been surprised to hear that the women working there were treated more fairly than almost any other venue in London.', 'The moral panic over sexual objectification of women has gone on for too long, and it\u2019s not progressive.', 'The 21st century feminist movement needs to update the agenda to include people (of all genders) who consent to sexual objectification in return for money, within a capitalist system that turns all labour into a commodity.', 'We need to have serious conversations about what happens when strip clubs are shut down and sex work is criminalised.', 'We need to acknowledge the disastrous economics of austerity that have pushed more women into sex work in the first place.', 'We must accept that putting women out of work and taking away their methods of financial independence puts them in even more precarious circumstances.', 'I\u2019ve seen for myself how \u2018agencies\u2019 and rogue operators crop up in place of clubs, taking full advantage of the financial insecurity young women face.', 'I\u2019ve felt the effects of the Policing and Crime Act 2009, a law that was fought for by the radical feminist left, but has in fact had a devastating effect on working conditions for strippers.', 'That law was supposed to end exploitation and \u2018clean up\u2019 the industry, but in reality exploitation has increased thanks to unreasonable licensing conditions, club closures, and a systematic failure to address the issue of dancers\u2019 employment rights.', 'We must understand how, by driving stripping and sex work off the high street and underground into private, unlicensed and unsafe flats and hotels, we actually feed the patriarchy.', 'We must not forget that male power and dominance has thrived for thousands of years by denying women their self-determination, and so by removing women\u2019s choices, even to do sex work, we undermine true feminism.', 'The genie won\u2019t go back in the bottle, sex work is here to stay. The real debate is how safe or dangerous do we want it to be for those of us who choose it?",

And how can anyone call themselves a feminist who is also happy to be 'sexually objectified' for money. The meaning of the word is now just bandied about and lost!",

Second to that, plenty of women work their way through university doing a wide range of jobs, so yes, stripping was a choice.",
