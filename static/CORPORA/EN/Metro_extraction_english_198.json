        "postText": "Youtubers Joel & Lia, owners of the Being British channel, have posted an apology after causing an uproar with their recent upload Which ares of London are Dangerous?', 'The video saw them claiming areas of London with a higher percentage of Black, Asian and minority ethnic residents made them feel unsafe, while making disparaging and seemingly racist comments.', 'The pair were heavily criticised for the footage, which at one point saw them say they had come to realise people with head scarves are \u2018just normal people,\u2019 and telling viewers they felt areas like New Cross and Lewisham were unsafe, joking that they would be robbed of their Macbooks.', 'They were further criticised when they removed the video from their channel.', 'Joel and Lia have since taken to Twitter to apologise for the tone deaf video.', '\u2018As some of you may be aware, we posted a video about a month ago titled \u2018Which areas of London are Dangerous?\u2019 after many of our viewers requested it,\u2019 they wrote. \u2018Yesterday it was brought to our attention that this was highly inappropriate as many of the places we mentioned have high BME percentages. We are so sorry for ay offence that it has caused.', '\u2018It truly wasn\u2019t our intention at all and we know that on this occasion we got it wrong. We have let our followers down. We will work harder on providing more educated opinions in future.\u2019', 'The apology was met with support from a few fans, who responded saying the video had merely been their \u2018opinion\u2019 and shouldn\u2019t cause offense, however, the original post caused severe backlash for their \u2018racist and classist dog whistle rhetoric\u2019.', 'One user on Twitter said: \u2018They picked places with high BME %s and were using coded language throughout the whole video. just be racist with ur chest [sic].\u2019', 'The channel Being British is described by Joel and Lia \u2018as a little corner in the internet where we talk about British culture, compared to other cultures, accents, and life in the UK.\u2019', 'In their trailer, they warned: \u2018If you are easily offended and everything triggers you, then don\u2019t subscribe.\u2019', '\u2018But if you have a winning personality and love all things British and you are not an a***hole then this channel is for you,\u2019 Lia added.",
