So proof that with a good education anyone of any colour can get paid!\nParents try preventing your kids following BLM and the pop culture that will brainwash them into wanting to be the best singer, dancer, rapper or celebrity... This is what's holding back our<b>  black</b> children today, the false image of getting rich quick being presented to our babies... This will destroy them!\nWe need to take responsibility for our kids, both parents should have equal part in raising a child.\nPlease stop worrying about skin colour and fighting for<b>  \"blac</b>k\" rights? Why not start to make money in this rich society, I can almost guarantee eve<b> ry bla</b>ck child that is told to get studying instead of partying will be successful and just as rich as my kids and them \"white people\". \nBless\u2764",

I think that you don't fucking care whether your neighbor has a job or whether they're able to feed their fucking kids.  I think you'd let them fucking starve just because of your hatred for Donald Trump.  I bet you'd kill people just to satisfy that revenge.  Why do you hate Trump?  BECAUSE THE MEDIA HAS FUCKING LIED TO YOU.  It's fucking sad.  All of your hatred is based on falsehoods.",

A white man will never see a non white man as equal, they won't say it outright but deep down they believe the pseudoscience as it's ingrained in the very depth of most white men's psyche, this psyche manifest's itself in an innumerable amount of ways.  White men want to preserve their position of power for as long as possible. They are so scared because they know diversity is an inevitable part of the homosapien cycle.",

Your burning hatred for any resistance to white supremacy says a lot about you. \"Violent and <b> Racist </b>left\" pathetic. The paradox of tolerance was described by Karl Popper in 1945. The paradox states that if a society is tolerant without limit, their ability to be tolerant will eventually be seized or destroyed by the intolerant (eg. Nazis).

Second, do you agree or disagree with the fact that car insurance is more expensive for men, and if so, could you point out the reasons why?
