        "postText": "'The actress slammed bosses for caving into pressure and axing the practise of females escorting male darts players to the stage.', 'However, the 38-year-old is not alone, as a petition to reverse the ban has already garnered more than 30,000 signatures.', 'It\u2019s a well-paid job, Kelly commented, after her own experience as a flag girl at the Formula One.', 'It\u2019s one of the best jobs I ever had, the model continued during an interview on Loose Women.', 'Kelly added: You dress glamorously and obviously it\u2019s about being presentable but I never felt I was taken advantage of.', 'It comes after The Women's Sport Trust posted on Twitter: We applaud the Professional Darts Corporation moving with the times and deciding to no longer use walk - on - girls.Motor racing, boxing and cycling\u2026 your move.', 'Meanwhile, This Morning aired a heated debate between a feminist and walk-on girls Daniella Allfree, 30, and Charlotte Wood, 29, last week.', 'The latter said the darts had accounted for 60 per cent of her income prior to the shock move.', 'It\u2019s a very enjoyable job, Charlotte commented, as Daniella continued: It\u2019s scary where it\u2019s going.', 'But writer Sally Howard said what they did was demeaning broadly to women.', 'Charlotte went on while speaking to BBC Radio 5 live: Everybody chooses to do a job, and I feel like if I 'm being told I can't do this job, then my rights are being taken away.', 'I go to work, I put on a nice dress and I escort darts players on to the stage. I smile and that is it. I don't honestly see what the problem is.', 'She added: Where do we stop with this? I would be immensely proud if I had a daughter [doing the job of a walk-on girl].', 'World number one Michael van Gerwen, however, believed the tradition should end.', 'Predicting it last year he told AD Sportwereld: The PDC wants more people to see it as a sport.It does not interest me[walk - on girls].It is just a sport.'",
