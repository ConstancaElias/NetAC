And to me honestly, if we can't see or understand that the problem comes from both sides,   that's the problem,  it's the reason for all the nonsense.  My point is instead of completely shutting down any ideas brought by the congresswoman ,  why not solve the problem?  The Jewish state ain't perfect!! It has many flaws,  in Israel,  I heard you can't even preach other religions publicly for the sake of the Israel state religion.  Israel is a great country,  lots of good things about it but there is a problem.  There is conflict between Palestine and Israel and there ain't anything perfect about either side so that's why we need diplomacy,  that's why we need proper negotiation, this is why it's so stinking ridiculous why we can't just make a stinking agreement,  or a peaceful one for a STATE that protects both JEWS and PALESTINIANS AND NOT ONE OVER THE OTHER,  after several decades of crap negotiations that went nowhere.!! And to completely take one side on the issue without considering the intent of the other is nonsense!  We should just work together and get the diplomacy going,  what's taking so long? It's almost been a hundred FREAKING years why can't we just MAKE diplomacy happen!!  Where's the peace,  where's the conversation we're all SUPPOSED to be HAVING!   Let's make it happen.",

He was a pedophile little boy raping little boy dick sucking pillow biting pantywaist <b> faggot </b>of a prophet. Just like every man in the Muslim faith they all suck cock and take it up the ass. So being that Ilhan Omar is letting her brother impregnate her and shitting out his children isn't that bad when you look at how disgustingly sick the prophet Muhammad was. and if Rashida tlaib and ilhan Omar could suck Satan's cock their self they would in a heartbeat so would every man of the Muslim religion they love sucking cock just like every<b>  faggot</b> at CNN and MSNBC",

            "commentText": "It is shocking and disgusting some of the comments that the Trump trolls are making here. No one in Congress had the guts to stand up to the criminally insane and tyrannical government of Israel except one <b> woman.</b>.. A Somalian<b>  refugee</b> who came to America for a better life for herself and her family and now is braver than any native-born member of Congress in standing up to basically the government of Israel which i<b> s nothin</b>g but window dressing for the Illuminati which in case anybody doesn't know or just the world bankers who own and control the rest of us... Kudos to Omar and Talib they are more patriotic and believe in our constitution then 95% of the Kool-Aid drinking, illiterate and dysfunctional morons that the CIA counts on to continue its control over all of us! Go ahead and take your best shot at me guys...because a thousand of you couldn't muster enough courage or brain cells to bring Homer Simpson or Archie Bunker back to life... what is really sad is when she stands up for the Palestinians she is actually standing up for everybody including all you dumbasses who blindly follow Trump<b> 's raci</b>st tweets and his divide-and-conquer strategy basically counting on Americans turning against each other while they continue to pick all our pockets. Just think about this people... the Israeli government runs a 10 billion dollar a year Surplus and we have given them in the last couple years 150 billion dollars in foreign aid. What do you think we could have done in this country with that 150 billion dollars...? I will tell you a couple of things we could have done with that money: we could have completely paid off all student debt and had tens of billions of dollars for massive infrastructure programs as well as funds for health care and education and still had money left over... just like Tulsi gabbard talks about in many of her speeches if we take the money from regime-change Wars which is a lot of the Israeli foreign aid goes to believe it or not then we would have all the money we need to take care of our own people without raising a single penny and taxes here but creating trillions of dollars of New Wealth by investing in our people. All you guys know deep down inside that I am right you are just somehow so infatuated with this moron in the White House and I'm sorry he is a moron and very manipulative human being all he worships is the almighty dollar and he will use anybody S and ends to his means to line his own pockets and take care of the people who bailed him out for decades from all his financial stupidity but he's not that stupid because he was able to get in the White House and basically create an even bigger Network for his criminal Enterprise he is no better than the clintons or the bushes they are all the same pimping the system to take care of themselves and their cronies we do not have a two party system in this country we have a two-class system here the oligarchy and the rest of us who are financially enslaved to them with a few exceptions... I posted a few videos demonstrating the war crimes of the Israeli government right now and even how our own country participates and gives Israel whatever it wants including changing laws in our own country which puts the Israeli government above our own citizens and if you think things are bad now... Give it some more time and it will be much worse if Netanyahu and his Rothschild Mafia have things their way right here in the USA... the Israeli government does not need a two-state solution... They already have a 50 state solution... think about that...that's really fucked up isn't it...? If you guys never have seen this video before there are many like it but mr. Grant really does a great job in explaining what's really going on and the history of it if you haven't seen this before or understand anything about what Israel has done behind the scenes to our own government you are going to be very shocked and incredibly freaking pissed off... especially some of you Trump supporters because Trump blindly follows Netanyahu around like a little puppy dog because Trump basically is controlled by this group of people in after you watch this entire video you're going to look at everything a little bit differently and you'll realize why Trump moved our Embassy for Netanyahu and also Trump recognizing the Golan Heights is being Israeli Sovereign territory against all International laws and decency and after you watch the first video then you will be prepared to see the second one because it will make a whole lot more sense and especially if you are a veteran and never knew this because your government tries to keep this from you then you will be so angry you probably won't sleep too good for a while especially you vets but I digress and I will let the following two videos speak for them self instead of wasting time spoiling hatred on all these threads just sit there and watch these two documentaries and I will guarantee you if you really are a patriotic American who loves his country you will never be the same after watching both of these documentaries and please come back and let me know what you think after watching these two documentaries I would appreciate the feedback and see what people think and feel when they have never known the truth about these things or probably never knew about them at all... God bless and save our Republic!\n [LINK] \n [LINK] \n [LINK] \n [LINK] \n [LINK] \n [LINK] ",

America needs to wake the F up and stop this lie, Like seriously what happened to us, why are we supporting this lies, those Arabs who live in Gaza and Israel today are from neighboring countries and it has been proving they have no connection to the philistines, the philistines themselves don't have a single connection to Israel, they fought Israel because they wanted to conquer the land and failed, the philistines came at 1250 BCE to Israel from the Aegean sea, i don't see any Arab mentioning that, also the philistines are greeks they are Europeans they have <b> zero </b>connection to Israel and btw the Israelis who were sent to the diaspora by the Romans are the same jews who came back so I can say if the Arabs claim themselves as philistines then they are the Europeans LMAO. The Arabs of today don't share nor the culture nor the language of the philistines America needs to End The Big Palestine Lie, I'm tired of this shit.

Mouvement-Quebec's website basically calls Canada's Constitution a \"Myth.\" Basically, they claim that The French weren't included in the talks when Canada's Confederation was signed in Charlottetown, P.E.I in 1867 due to The Treaty of Paris. Of course, even through The Canadian Encyclopedia, is was mentioned that Prince Edward Island didn't even sign Canada's Confederation until 1873, so why would The French sign it after France lost to The British after The French/Indian Wars (The Napoleon Wars)? Of course, if it wasn't for The French supplying munitions to our Separatists during The American Revolution, our U.S. Founding Fathers would have never won The American Revolution. I have to wonder about all that as well, and Quebec's Sovereignty Movement did spring back into action last year.",

            "commentText": "Ya know....when President Jimmy Carter wrote about The Balfour Declaration of November, 1917 which led to the re-establishment of Israel in 1948 that Baron Lionel Walter Rothschild signed as mentioned as well through The Encyclopedia Britannica, did anyone question where a Jewish Rothschild Banker that uses the term, 'Baron' in front of his name comes from, because the first person I thought about was \"The <b> Red<b>  </b</b>>Baron\" from WWI. I had to know where they come from.\n\nOf course, Lord Baron Jacob Rothschild gave an interview on YouTube about his family's involvement in restoring Israel in Palestine due to Baron Lionel Walter Rothschild who signed The Balfour Declaration of November, 1917. Of course, Baron Jacob Rothschild was a Lord in The House of Lords.\n\nDid you know that it was mentioned in The Jewish Encyclopedia published in 1906, Vol. 10, pp. 490 that Mayer Amschel Rothschild was an agent of Prince William Landgrave IX of Hesse Cassel (sometimes spelled with a \"K\") who funded British Troops against The American Revolution? Of course, it was also mentioned in The Journals of The House of Commons published in 1803 by The Parliament of Great Britain that Prince William Landgrave IX of Hesse Kassel married Princess Mary, the daughter of King George II from Great Britain. There are also other sources on Prince William Landgrave IX of Hesse Kassel who married Princess Mary. \n\nThrough Histor<b> y Do</b>t Com, they mentioned The Royal Marriage Act of 1772 which led to Queen Victoria's Matchmaking of her nine chilldren's 42 grand children - quote: \"Eventually, seven of them sat on European thrones in Russia, Greece, Romania, Britain, Germany, Spain and Norway\u2014and all would take sides during World War I with disastrous consequences.\"\n\nThe Rothschild Banking Barons worked their un-welcomed way back into The United States through August Belmont, and they even mention August Belmont on The Rothschild Foundation's Website. I believe that was around the time that President Andrew Jackson stood against The Rothschild Bankers after taking over President John Quincy Adam's Anti Mason Party formed in the early 1800s after Capt. William Morgan was murdered at Lake Ontario after writing the book, \"Illustrations of Freemasonry.\" Capt. William Morgan's Tombstone at his Memorial also mentions in stone that he was killed by Freemasons. August Belmont also promoted Salmon P. Chase according to books written in the 1800s, and Salmon P. Chase became upset over the accusations made against Simon Wol<b> f, A</b>be Lincoln's Jewish Attorney who was threatened with arrest by a U.S. Colonel Baker from The U.S. War Department for espionage. Simon Wolf was supposedly caught trading with Southern Jews during The Civil War. Mr. Wolf also wrote a book proclaiming his innocence titled, \"Presidents I Have Known 1860 - 1918,\" and The Jewish Historical Society of Greater Washington wrote about Simon Wolf as well who was also a spokesman for B'nai B'rith formed in October of 1843 & a member of The Washington Congregation of Hebrews. \n\nOf course, there are also books from the 1800s talking about Simon Wolf and The Rothschild Banking Barons. Simon Wolf was impressed by The Rothschild's mansions and castles, and The Rothschild Bankers did deal in Slavery through The Freshfield Family out of London. Of course, Colonel Taylor worked w<b> ith </b>Abe Lincoln to come out with \"Greenbacks\" at \"No Interest\" which could have been seen as impeding on The Rothschild's business affairs. Of course, George Peabody received huge loans from British Bankers after The Civil War ended before working with Julius Spencer Morgan to form J.P. Morgan & Company known today as J.P. Morgan & Chase, and The Biography Channel also mentioned those British Loans through their documentary on J.P. Morgan. Of course, Glen Beck was fired after mentioning The Rothschild Bankers after interviewing G. Edward Griffin about his book, \"The Creature From Jekyll Island,\" which is about when The Rothschild, Rockefeller, Morgan, Warburg, and Chase Bankers met on Jekyll Island in 1910 to discuss the creation of our Private Central Bank called our Federal Reserve Bank. Of course, The Federal Reserve Act was signed on December 23rd, 1913, two days before Christmas, two months after The (ADL) Anti Defamation League was formed, and one year before WWI broke out.\n\nOf course, people forget about Canada's History on when The British controlled Upper Canada after The Battle of Quebec in 1759 and The Treaty of Paris in 1763-1783. There was also The War of 1812 when The British burned down The White House, and The Aroostook War 1838-9 in Aroostook County, Maine which was a border skirmish/dispute between The British and The United States. Of course, even through The Encyclopedia Britannica, The Canadian Monarchy is known as The British Monarchy. The Bank of Canada is a Crown Corporation controlled by The Crown of Canada, and The Queen of England sits on The Crown of Canada. Rent Subsidies from Crown Land in Canada still goes to The Crown of Canada. Of course, Crown Land is Public Land in Canada, and The Queen of England is all supposed to be symbolic. Canada also still has a Privy Council just like Great Britain. Ireland got rid of their Privy Council in 1933 due to The British meddling into their political affairs after Ireland gained their sovereignty from The British. Of course, who looks into ties between The Rothschild & Sons Company in Canada (large shares in TD Trust) and The Queen of England?\n\nOf course, England did join Scotland to form Great Britain in 1707. In 1901, Great Britain did join Northern Ireland to form The United Kingdom. The United Kingdom later joined Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, & Sweden to form The European Union. 28 countries in all. I find all that rather interesting and questionable. I believe everyone else should question all that as well. \n\nOf course, France fought The British in many battles before The Napoleon Wars. No more battles between France and The British followed The Battle of Waterloo that U.S. General Mark Milley, today, likes telling his cadets to remember at The ROTC at Norwich University while he talks about 'Little Green Men.\" 12 years after The Battle of Waterloo, France & Britain became allies at The Battle of Navarino, or was that all due to Mayer Amschel Rothschild's son, Nathaniel Rothschild, who connived his way into winning the bid on the loan for The Reparations of France after The Battle of Waterloo with Napoleon as depicted in that 20th Century Fox Movie from 1934 called \"The House of Rothschild?\"  \n\nOf course, I could mention other things I question involving cover ups, and I'm a direct descendant of Reverend George Wightman (Baptist Encyclopedia), brother of Reverend Valentine Wightman (Baptist Encyclopedia) who married Susannah Holmes, the great grand daughter of Roger Williams (Encyclopedia - The Founder of Rhode Island in 1636). Of course, Roger Williams was a Puritan, and The Mayflower came in 1620 with a boat load of Puritans after The First British Colony was established in 1607 in Jamestown, Virginia after Capt. John Cabot discovered North America after reaching the shores of Newfoundland in 1498.",

Erdogan is the biggest threat to the world, he strifes to create an islamic empire, to crush the western infidel countries and to take control of all. Since Russia isn't western he has found a natural ally in Putin. People like Erdogan will lead the world to world war 3, and that will bring the western world in danger. The Kurds were fighting this evil, they are peace loving people who fight for freedom. Trump has lost his mind and you should vote for another if you love your country.",

From news reports from every outlet you can think of sticking up for both sides and criticizing both sides ive come to the conclusion that Israel is opressing the Palestinian people and trying to take as much as they can with illegal settlements and using its power to not find ways to come to a 2 state peaceful solution. There have been individuals on both sides who have tried but they get assassinated. Im not condoning anyone who says death to Israel and wishing they were wiped off the earth just like i dont condone the very blatant mistreatment of Palestinians by Israeli soldiers. Ive seen cruel things done by those soldiers. The statement i was referring to that Rep Omar said was the very huge israeli lobbyist group giving huge money to American politicians to get things passed in their favor. This statement is true. Israel and many other lobbyists pump money into the American political system so much so that the system has become corrupted.   I have not heard Omar say she supports a boycott of Israel or that she supports islamic countries that want to kill anyone that doesnt agree with their views. Im reacting to her statement about republicans supporting Israel because of huge money given to them by Israeli lobbyists. This is true. Only one being boycotted is Omar by Israel  baning her from entering Israel. That doesnt sound like democracy to me. What i dont like is that any criticism of the Israeli government and their policies or disagreeing with Netanyahu in any way is met with you being called an antisemite. That is bullshit. Im not saying all palestinians are doing the right things but to me America especially with Trump in the White house is favoring one side way over the other. I know..your shouting israel is our one and only democratic ally in the middle east right? Well they are not treating palestinians very democratically. My friend in my eyes watching those walls and fenced in check points set up by Israel and how the Israeli soldiers are treating the palestinian people i see resemblances of how the <b> nazi </b>gustapo treated jews back in the 1930's and the 1940's. Rep Omar is a democratically elected congressman. I want to say if you dont like it you can leave this country but that would be stooping to Trumps level so i wont say you or anyone should do that. In a true democracy the statement love it or leave it is said by idiots who usually are<b>  racist</b> narcissistic and dont know what democracy is. Basically Trump but thats another whole story.",

These women do not represent America, only a small portion of Michigan and Minnesota.",

Of course, people do call Lord James Meyer Sassoon, The Rothschild of The East. I'm not sure if the reason for that is due to the fact that Lord James Meyer Sassoon along with Lord Baron Jacob Rothschild met with The H.E. Chinese Ambassador at The Chinese Embassy a few years prior to when Lord Blackheath made what people called, \"his odd statement\" in The House of Lords, or if was due to the fact that Lord Sassoon is or was The Chairman of The British Chinese Business Council? Of course, The NY Times and Rolling Stones Magazine mentioned The HSBC Bank in their articles titled, \"Too Big To Jail Banks.\" I wonder if that is all connected? Besides, why wouldn't Lord Blackheath mention the foundation he was talking about unless that foundation hit close to home?",

Of course, there are also other books from The 1800s and 1700s talking about Prince William Landgrave IX of Hesse Kassel out of Germany that married Princess Mary, the daughter of King George The II from Great Britain. \n\nYou should also look back into Canadian History, because The British controlled Canada after The Battle of Quebec and Treaty of Paris. Of course, there was also The War of 1812 when The British burned down The White House and The Aroostook War in 1838-9 that is also in The Encyclopedia Britannica as well. Tell me....who are The Loyalists and who are The Separatists? Should I talk about August Belmont who was an agent of The Rothschild Banking Barons during the early 1800s when The Rothschild's slimmed their way back into The United States like the slithering snakes that they whose family probably vowed to retake control over The United States. Of course, Pastor John Torell stated that he found a link between Jacob Frank, The Rothschilds, and Prof. Adam Weishaupt's Illuminati that Adam formed while attending The University of Ingolstadt in Bavaria, Germany on The 1st of May, 1776 when The Illuminati was founded.",

Susannah Holmes was also the grand daughter of Obediah Holmes (Encyclopedia) whom <b> Abe </b>Lincoln falls under except<b>  Abe</b> Lincoln fell under Sarah Bowne, Susannah's 1st cousin. Reverend George Wightman's son, Reverend John Wightman who married Jane Bentley, was the father of Mary Wightman who married Capt. Samuel Boone Jr.. Capt. Samuel Boone Jr. was elected as a Captain through The North Kingstown Company before The American Revolution broke out. At th<b> e ag</b>e of 59, Capt. Samuel Boone Jr. refused to allow his sons to join The American Revolution. General William West was responsible for weeding out Loyalists in the state of Rhode Island before the war broke out. I believe he was responsible for stripping Capt. Samuel Boone Jr. of his title, place of birth, and 600 acre lot of land in Exeter, Rhode Island before Capt. Samuel Boone Jr. fled to Canada along with 50,000 to 70,000 other Loyalists. His siblings and sibling's wives also left with him. Of course, Capt. Samuel Boone Jr. was buried in Lancaster, NB while his wife, Mary Wightman, remained behind and died on The Boone Lot next to Boone Lake never to see her husband or children ever again. Afraid for their kids lives they were. Of course, The Boone name was long ago known as 'de Bohun' according to The Boone Society, so I guess that makes me a descendant of The British Royals as well. Of course, so was Daniel Boone who did join a militia in The American Revolution. Humphrey De Bohun (Encyclopedia) had his head split in two by Robert The Bruce after William Wallace fought against King Edward The 1st. Yeah...I'm a descendant of The British Royals just like The Queen of England. Of course, I'm not rich like they are, and I grew up believing in what our U.S. Founding Fathers set out to create, so I guess that means I'm not a Loyalist like my direct ancestor was. Of course, I have other ancestors who did fight in The American Revolution. Of course, there is a lot of lineage in a person's family tree, and you all need to ask, \"Who is a Loyalist and who is not?\" That is the only way you'll ever solve this whole mess we're all living in.",

Lots of players...Of course, G, Edward Griffin's Book is rather interesting, because David Rockefeller built The United Nations according to The NY Times, and The IMF and World Bank were created by The United Nations. The IMF basically bail out country's National Debts with 'interest loans' prolonging the inevitability of widespread famine that follows Hyperinflation as taught through community college textbooks like \"A Survey of Economics\" which is a book they use at NMCC in Presque Isle, Maine. Of course, one only needs to research deeper at their local library when it comes to widespread famine that follows Hyperinflation. Who are the ones that suffer then?",

No they're not\".\nI'm assuming you are referring to the fact that you believe White Jews think they are the only ones that are Semitic. \nWell first of all,  \"Semitic \" actually comes from \"SHEM\", or \"of Shem\".\nIt's \"Shemite\".\nAll peoples who have come from the lineage of Shem,  Noach's son, are Shemitic -of Shem. \nThat lineage goes through the male only, because the male is the one with the sperm,  and the sperm carriers the blood,  and the life is in the blood.\n\nThe tribe of Yahuwdah doesn't only consist of Caucasian...or a fair skinned person,  but if we want a better clarification,  we would not neglect to the following Jewish lineage: ETHIOPIAN,  <b> INDIAN,</b> MAORI, INDONESSIAN, RUSSIAN, GERMAN, YEMEMITE, LIBYAN, BRAZILLIAN, ARABIAN, ARGENTINIAN, VENEZUELAN, CHINESE,  JAPANESE and more. You are seeing what the world states as Ashkenazim or Shaphardism. Have you even seen the diversity of Yisra'el? \nThis<b>  woman</b> omar for instance, a Somalian, can't trace her lineage back 2900 years,  she can't even make any references to who married who 2900 years ago. \nOver 3000 years,  peoples have assimilated, intermarried, been carried off in wars as slaves,  been displaced,  had uninvite<b> d sexua</b>l relations,  been forced to convert to islam or die, converted to other religions because of persecution etc. \n\n\n\nSo please don't speak of something that you can't be bothered doing in-depth study on. \nAnd please don't do study based on the \"Anti -Jew\" direction.",

The disgusting comments being made by poorly educated criminals are not Anti-Semitic. They are anti-Jewish. How Anti-semitism works is when some uneducated fuck says I wish the \"A\"-Rabs and \"Jews\" would figure out their stupidity (I am half-Palestinian). That would be an Anti-Semitic statement. Semites are people from Semitic background. Arabs and Jews. A comment is usually Anti-Jewish or Anti-Arab. The need to redefine words is on the same poorly educated level as Americans renaming the country of Iraq as \"EYE-RAK\". Educate the masses.",

It's sad to see our soldiers fighting and dying for Israel's wars. If Congress and any politician feels such loyalty to Israel, then move there. So on to another point people. No matter who you vote for President, they will NEVER change the policy in the Middle East always favoring Israel. Their campaign slogans are \"change\" or \"country first.\" In reality, it should be NO CHANGE and \"ISRAEL FIRST\"!",

I don't care what side of the fence you represent if you speak lies then you must suffer. One the other hand if you speak the truth and those who know the truth you spoke retaliate with BS then not just freedom of speech doesn't exist but speaking from one's own heart should be banned as well.",

            "commentText": "I agree that what has become the norm is that any criticism of Israel is considered anti-Semitic. However, to stay silent when Israel's snipers aim at medics during demonstrations has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt by many external investigations and I have watched and seen the results of the line of fire.  We have to speak out and demand that the one or ones who gave the order, or if it was the sniper's own choice of target, we need to see some sort of punishment or at the very least an acknowledgement of fault. When you fire at medics the goal is to increase casualties because no one with any skill is there to aid the fallen. I have supported Israel through thick and <b> thin </b>over the years but with the emergence of new violent hardliners who want to create a country for Jews alone when they have a significant number of peaceful Muslims living among them is worrisome. It needs to be an open discussion and I know that many American Jews are concerned about the direction that Israel is taking.",

There are many ways to interpret what the scriptures says about Jews.\n \nSome have debated that Israel is Jesus's \"spiritual kingdom\" and not the real physical kingdom on earth. Others believe that the real Jews are gone and that today's Jews are imposters; or are even the Pharisees (who some believe engaged in degeneracy).\n\n\nSince nearly 2000 years, The Bible and related scriptures have been re-translated and re-interpreted many times. It is possible that the Bible today may not accurately represent the true Bible taught millennias ago due to meanings/messages lost in time. It also doesn't help that the original creator(s) of the bible are long dead.",

            "commentText": "Israel was the first country to recognize Ethiopia.  It also does more for Ethiopians than any other country including Kenya.  Even in Kenya they have an affinity for Israel.  Both of these countries are Muslim btw.  But when it comes to Ethiopia all their refugees all go directly to Israel for alot of reasons.  They alow them to recover their strength for a few months and then they give them over $1000 and send them on their way to whichever country that will grant them asylum or passage to Europe.  \nWhat are they fleeing?  Islam ....it's what she represents and it's why they have this anti Israeli POV as Israel has taken in many Ethiopian political rivals of the Ruling party which are violent Islamists.\nIt's how Ilhan Omar ended up here when her family fled the war and famin. Remember the Ethiopian choking on a piece of rice joke your heard as a kid?\nYep those were Jews and Evangelist advocating for her people.  She is ungrateful and entitled but also a criminal and a foreign agent.\nBut she claims Jews have loyalties to Israel and not the US, that they only do it for the money, and that the only reason they participate in our government is to help Israel maintain it's power over the world.  \nHow could anyone question American Jewish loyalties? \nHas any of these people taken an actual inventory of what Jews have contributed and cost this country?\n\nI bet if you take an inventory of Ethiopians you won't find that much at all. Actually it's safe to say they gave taken alot more than they have given back. \nJust like every other group who is aggressively critical towards Jewish people and Israel.   \n\nYou catch people the same way you catch a fish.\n\n~Old Jewish Proverb\n\nLoL",

This does not mean she is an out and out anti semite. \n\nI would say the implications of her tweets are in poor taste, that they may inadvertently reinforce antisemitic tropes, but to throw antisemitism as a charge against her personally is very serious.\n\n\nOne question I have for my fellow Democrats though is this. What in the fuck  did you expect to happen in this situation?\n\nOur 1st Muslim congresswoman makes a comment about a Jewish lobby, off course there is going to be outrage and misunderstanding from every freaking angle. \n\n80% of Evangelicals (of all different ethnicities) voted for President Trump. These are Republican Christians. It does not take a damn rocket scientist to understand that such people would be pro Israel.\n\nChristians also struggle with antisemitic tropes because of certain texts, streams of tradition, and history, from within their own movement.\n\n There are many and diverse facets of Christian identity  which tie themselves to that tiny patch of land in the middle east as a matter of identity. \n\nOn the flip side, Is Rep. Omar supposed to supress any opinion she may hold due to her cultural frame of reference, her upbringing, her faith, her experienxes, the contentious relationship of recent times between Jews and Muslims? \n\nI mean, who is suprised? <b> Nobody </b>who pays attention.\n\nI mean, the Democratic party always talks about horrors of white privilege, toxic masculinity, and bigotry, and lauds wanting to embrace diversity, tolerance, and diverse views, and ways of life, but now you are stuck in a quagmire around the very thing you say you cherish because in this situation, you will have views that are mutually exclusive, that talk past one another.\n\nYou cannot please everyone of every background,<b>  ethnicity</b>, orientation, and perspective, especially when there are fundamental divisions in identity and perspective THAT ARE KNOWN to everyone. \n\nYou cant expect Jewish Americans to be happy about Omar's statements, but you are suprised she made them, or surprised at the reaction of Islamic communities?\n\nThis is the problem with hinging things on identity rather than policy.",

            "commentText": "If we define anti semitisim as literally any criticism of Israel at all then it is indeed a usefull diplomatic tool unavailable to the majority of <b> nation </b>states. If Israel can effectively exclude non jews from citizenship (which it does) and prioritize white European jews in selecting potential immigrants (which it does) then criticism of the state, of Zionism or of any aspect of the Israeli government is by definition anti semitic. It is in effect an ethnostate and 'theo-state' (yeah, there's probably an actual word for that, but I haven't got a thesaurus) with an inbuilt defence against external critique. So 'what's her name' basically said that the US only supports Israel because of political donations. Well... so? The whole US political system (and most other outwardly democratic systems around the world) run on political donations. Pointing out that all our favourite political parties are essentially hoars for cash and uncritical coverage is not a cogent argument, especially if you are a registered member of one of the two worst offenders. Neither is it criticism of the state of Israel or jews individually or in plurality. Not actually anti semitic. \nIf white supremacists finally establish their ethnostate they should take a leaf from Israel's book. Criticism of the white government would then be simply a case of<b>  racism</b> against the maste<b> r rac</b>e. Don't like Australian immigration policy? Anti antipodean. Don't like French trade policy? Anti Mime wearing a beret and eating baguette. Upset with British foreign policy? Anti person who says sorry a lot and likes drinking tea. Uggh. Its not the same though. To use this cheat you need an ethnically and theologically homogenous population. Not fair!",

            "commentText": "This\nnational discussion over Omar's anti-Semitic remarks didn't result in her\ncondemnation by the House. To the contrary, the House majority revealed itself\nto be deeply divided on the question of how to handle blatant anti-Semitism.\nOmar has said far worse things in the past, but she gets a free pass from the\nDems and the news media and Twitter. Instead the Democratic party focuses on\ndefending Jihadists and their calls to wipe Israel\noff the map. Omar came here as a <b> refugee </b>from Mogadishu\nin 1995 and now wants to tell all Americans how the Country should think and\nlook like. How did a she get elected, marrying her brother to allow him to be\nin the states. \n\n\nBill\nClinton's legacy: \n\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the U.S.\nState Department began bringing large numbers of Somali nationals to Minnesota,\nassigning them<b>  refugee</b> status due to the civil war and general violence and\npoverty which still grips Somalia\ntoday.\n\n\nBy the end\nof 2010, the U.S.\nhad admitted 83,991 Somali nationals, with roughly 40 percent of them initially\nsettling in Minnesota.\n\n\n\nMany more have since been allowed to immigrate legally, and many others have\nentered the country illegally as well.\n\n\n\nOf course, there is also a large concentration of these refugees in Maine\nas well, and like Minnesota,\nit's not the frigid temperatures that makes the state so attractive, but its\nextraordinarily generous welfare programs( Socialism ).\n\n\n\nWhat has been the result of this massive relocation of Somalis? In 2018\n(267,703) voters in Minnesota District 5 voted a Somali Muslim Socialist, Ilhan\nOmar, into the U.S.\nHouse of Representatives! BIG MISTAKE...Thanks to Bill Clinton\n\n\nIlhan Omar\nstated that she should not be expected to \"pledge allegiance/support for a\nforeign country,\" but does pledge allegiance to the Council on American\nIslamic Relations, which funded her congressional campaign and was found to\nhave ties to Hamas. \n\n\nThe\n'compromise' Democrats finally agreed upon was a resolution that not only\nlumped in the question of the moment \u2014 the effort by one member of Congress to\ndelegitimize Jews and supporters of Israel\n\u2014 with a laundry list of other hatreds. And they failed to single out Omar for\nher actions. BIG MISTAKE !\n\n\u00a0\nIt was a\ndisgrace display of Democrat partisanship that we saw yesterday by\nDemocrats\u00a0 passing legislation to condemn\nhate. Americans already condemn hate. \n\n\u00a0\nThey don't\nneed legislation to tell them that. What is at hand is anti-semitism. \n\n\u00a0\nDenouncing\nanti-Semitism especially when it's coming from a congresswomen. But in a\ndespicable display of partisanship, and to avoid ongoing embarrassment of the\nparty, Democrats decided to address the issue by attempting to pass an\nanti-Semitism bill (one that directly names the congresswomen) but instead of\ndoing so, Democrats decided to pass an anti-hate bill. A bill to include hate\nof any kind.\n\n\nMost see it as an attempt by Democrats to deflect blame away from the Congress\nwomen's controversial tropes against Israel\n(as Democrats call them) to a sweeping bill to condemn all type of hate.\n\n\n\nInstead of condemning the congresswomen and holding her accountable, Democrats\ndecided to pass an anti-bigotry bill.\n\n\nThe\nbeginning of the end for Omar....That this exercise was blatantly insincere was\nevident not only from the wording of the apology but also because of Omar's open\nsupport of the BDS \u2014 boycott, divestment, sanctions \u2014 movement against Israel\nwhich routinely traffics in anti-Semitism\n\n\u00a0\n\nSince the\nmass immigration some 100 years ago, Jews have become richest religious group\nin American society. They make up only 2% of US\npopulation, but 35% of 400 wealthiest Americans. How did it happen, and how\ncrucial is their aid to Israel?\n\n\n\nJews in all centers of power\n\nLauder is\ndefinitely not the only American Jew funneling money to Israel\nwhile influencing the country. Many Israeli adults used to receive a parcel\nfrom \"the rich uncle in America\"\nduring their childhood. Thousands of organizations, including hospitals and\nuniversities, receive billions of shekels in donations from the US.\nA Hebrew University\nstudy found that they make up about two-third of all donations in Israel.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSome 5.6\nmillion Jews live in the United States\n(not including half a million Israelis) \u2013 about 2% of the population. Most of\nthem reside in rich cities: Miami,\nLos Angeles, Philadelphia\nand Boston, and\nmainly New York. A recent\nstudy from 2008 found that Jews are the richest religious group in the US:\nForty-six percent of Jews earn more than $300,000 a year, compared to 15% among\nall Americans. Another Gallup\npoll conducted this year found that 75% of American Jews enjoy \"a high\nstandard of living\" compared to 50% of the population and more than any\nother religious group. \n\n\u00a0\n\nMore than\n200 of the 400 billionaires on Forbes' list of the wealthiest people in America\nare Jews. Seven of the 20 leading venture capital funds in the US\nbelong to Jews, according to Forbes. \n\n\nGoogle\nfounder Sergey Brin has a Jewish father, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is\nJewish, as is his deputy, David Fischer, the son of Bank of Israel\nGovernor Stanley Fischer. The ex-chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Shalom\nBernanke, is Jewish too, as is he predecessor, Alan Greenspan, and the Fed\nfounder, Paul Warburg. \n\n\nChoose your\nwords carefully Rep.

Pretty sure the US was prosperous well before Israel was even established. Cash and oil are the real gods, a US economy underpinned by cheap gasoline. Capitalisim is interested in a strong ally in the region, not messianic prophesy. Oil is the main reason anyone wants anything at all to do with the entire region. Once renewables kick in and oil is no longer as critical... will Israel still be supported? I fear that faith in capitalisim and US exceptionalisim may be short term thinking. With religiosity waning and secular politics becoming more popular, people will actually look at how nations (including Israel) interact financially and not automatically align themselves according to <b> race,</b> faith or a shared history. Screaming 'anti semite!' and claiming God's backing may no longer be a guaranteed free pass. Without US military aid, Israel will sit in a region amongst hostile neighbours, all deprived of oil revenue and all scrounging for water amongst the rocks. And all with a long list of grievances. Will the US still be there for Israel?",

The Palestinians didn't do anything to the Jews in WW2 and neither did the rest of us in the world and I don't see why we should betray our conscience for the sake of Israel and their immoral ways. We and the Arabs are NOT guilty of anything and the Israelis should abide by universal humanitarian standards, of their own will; The world around Palestine and the rest of the world should not be in danger because the Israelis no longer acknowledge Peace and the universal brotherhood of Man. The USA should not be held hostage for their sake. They need to come to the table and give up their sinful thieving and dishonest ways. PERIOD.",

                    "commentText": "@Erzsi Rodgers Oh Erzsi! I couldn't agree more. Comparative theology is so interesting. But I've moved on somewhat. As your witty post relates, the idea that someone could actually think that one of the three Abrehamic faiths rejects the <b> Old </b>Testament is both hilariously ignorant and hipocritical in the extreeme.The<b>  Quran</b> says that\u00a0the Torah, the Psalms and the Gospels as being revealed by God to the prophets Moses, David and Jesus. Like jews, they just don't like the christian copy of the same story! Its a bit like three farmers arguing about who's pig will graduate college first. Since the Protestant, Eastern Orthadox and Catholic bibles are all similarly in conflict it seems just a little academic. Muslims do at least treat Jesus as a prophet... much more generous than jewdaisim who consider him an abomination. I was especially amused by your pun regarding belief... that a modern christian has actually read th<b> e ol</b>d testament is not just unlikely but also a prerequisite for maintaining any regard for its value. The idea of placing any value on what is basically a bron<b> ze a</b>ge witchcraft manual would be amusing were it not so utterly sick. Being an observer to the clash between faiths is only mildly entertaining... after all, one can only watch 3 monkeys sling faeces at eachother for so long, and 2000 years is perhaps long enough. Like me, I imagine you have mixed feelings regarding the inevitable fate of the church. The child rape conviction of the 3rd m<b> ost sen</b>ior cardinal in the entire catholic church marks a new low on the descent of that institution... seminaries are empty and unable to replace this soon to retire generation of priests and the vocation of 'nun' is close to becoming non existent. Anglican congregations are fatally split and in decline. The loss of these traditional denominations is culturally regrettable but disasterous in the light of their replacement by business driven mega churches, McChurches if you will, an extension of morally corrupt TV evangelicals and sham clerics. It was inevitable that bystanders would eventually tire of the monkeys and their stool slinging, the spectacle no longer worth being spattered with filth. After all, we now have \"Game of Thrones\".<b>  The</b> old testament was a little too perverted for mass consumption anyway. Perhaps we all should believe in G.O.T instead? Seems a little more credible.",

If she could contribute to the destruction of Israel I'm certain she would.\n\nAOC: \nIn her Opus Magnum, the \"Green Dream\", which can be summarized as a series on outlandish, nonsensical statements, she has put in display for all to see her profound and vast ignorance not only of the planet and environmental sciences but also of economy and geopolitics. Her \"Green Dream\" has becoming the de facto \"Manifesto\" of the Democrat Party. \n\nRashid: \n\nHer sentiments are not too different than those of Omar. They both try desperately to outdo each other on their hatred for America, our form of government, our values, our beliefs and our heritage as <b> racist </b>and downright evil.\n\nWe need to encourage them so that they may continue on their warpath.\n\nBut wait, let us not forget the supporting cast, equally valuable in their important contribution to the mission:\n\nMaxine \"Auntie\" Waters \n\nHer main contribution is and has been her metamorphosis of the definition of <b> \"racism</b>\", which now includes every White person that does not conforms to her views and accepts them, no matter how idiotic they may be. Auntie Maxine's apparently gets paid to d<b> o nothin</b>g but utter one word incessantly: \"Impeach!\" Only in Washington one can get rich with a job like that!\n\nKamal Harris \n\nHer advocacy to legalize pot and prostitution, speaks volumes of her moral compass. Apparently she believes that prostitution elevates the dignity of women (guess that tenet is also part of the Me Too movement). She is also calling for reparations and, would not hesitate to name Louis Farrakhan as her running mate in h<b> er ra</b>ce for the presidency.\n\nMazai Hirono \n\nWell, she just knows men are evil and should stay home on election day. If she could drive them into indentured she probably would. In the meantime, she struggles to understand the law and find out how she will get back to Hawaii when AOC does away with aviation and fossil fuel.\n\nSo let's hope and pray that this \"winning team\", these beauties, stay the course and become more determined to continue spreading their message.\n\nin the meantime their chorus of supporters will continue hoping that Special Counsel Muller will  come down from heaven with a divine indictment lest in 2020 the American People ask them what did they actually DO to make ours a bet<b> ter Nat</b>ion...and Trump will once again be our President for yet another term!",

They voted in Hamas and use children as human shields. They don't support human rights like <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>rights and women's rights. Also to note, do you know all the financial aid Israel grants to the Palestinians? They also offer citizenship there for them. Let's call it as it is, without aid from the US Jews would be slaughtered by their neighboring countries. They hate them not because of occupation but because of ideology. Don't let them fool you. Antisemitism  is rising all across Europe, what's so wrong about them wanting a small state to call their refuge? They tried to be peaceful but the palestians immediately hated them because they were Jewish. This can be proven due to the fact that the Israeli government was trying to be peaceful with compromise.",

I think if they were to turn things around start telling the truth and stop being the enemy of the American people, the company would prosper.  Yet they feel they have more to lose by changing things and somebody with deep pockets will make more money by fake news and leave things the way they are.  The money the station makes is peanuts compared to what they make changing laws flooding countries with bad people and telling Americans that they are doing this for our own good and if you say anything, you are a <b> racist.</b>",

Democrats are another reason to promote a Constitutional Monarchy in the U.S. THis is not to say that the Republicans are clean, as they have just as much corruption as the Dems. Again, the seat of this CHRISTIAN <b> nation </b>should be APPOINTED by a MONARCH. Democracy (yes I know we are not a democracy, but I'm using that as a blanket term) is always going to bring more corruption than a Democracy would. We the people, will not let our great Fatherland/Motherland be dictated by Shariah Law. She should be ashamed and step down from her office. Hail Columbia!",

I would go so far as to say calling her anti Semitic hurts all Muslims and is anti Islamic hysteria by corrupt Jews in Congress who have used Jewish donors money to <b> black </b>mail congress. Muslims should unite at grass roots level to use these similar  Zionist crocodile tears  to deny Democrats their support. \nJews have been using this 'ant Semitic ' cliche like chewing gum becoming trite now. So hyperbolic! Guess a mosquito pricking a Jew is anti Semitic, tornado hitting Jewish area  is anti Semitic, guess God is anti Semitic for sending Mohamed, etc. \nthe worst American traitors are corrupt Congress taking  American first amendment right and free speech away to appease and finance Televiv for under the table election donation.",

First Judaism is a religion and Israel is a state or so-called \"country\" so if I attack the Jews themselves just because they are Jews I would say yes that's anti-Semitic, but attacking Israel state \"country\" that's not anti-Semitic or anti of any shit. Another point I want to address is addressing Judaism or Christianity or Islam it's not anti-Shit also, People have the right to speak and to address issues whether its a country, religion, culture, politics or anything else. THATS CALLED FREEDOM OF SPEACH ASSHOLES",

The sooner the Democratic leaders start taking a closer look at what Israel has been up to in the past 20 years, the sooner we can stop supporting the inhumane abuses it is imposing on a very weak and battered group of people.  After what the Jews went through in the 30's up to 1945 when they were saved by the U.S. military, you'd think that they would be concerned to never impose that kind of abuse on anyone.  Are there governments that would like to destroy Israel?  Sure.  But should they blame EVERY PERSON in those countries for the hatred of a few?  No, not ever.",

What I will say is that you MUST BE brand new and don't quite understand how it is done here. No one uses \"cash\" to be corrupt here anymore, silly. It's considered vulgar. Where have you and yours been for the last 100 years or so?  If you are trying to argue that one place's corruption is better than the other because of HOW it is done than you should be ashamed of yourself for being a hypocrite. Corruption is corruption. Period. \nAs for one religion over the other you need to step out of your bubble and go travel the US and actually see how fine and terrible the people can be, irrespective of <b> race </b>and religion or maybe because of<b>  race</b> and religion. The religion, regardless of what it is, is simply a mechanism of affirmation which justifies  that persons good or bad behavior with their neighbors.  Rather than say you kno<b> w nothin</b>g I choose to call you naive, happy to be here, and maybe a little afraid that you if say the \"wrong\" thing here you might get sent back to where ever you come from, because of course this also what certain Americans will push to do. Hmmm, with that in mind and if you are being honest? How safe does THAT make you feel?",

The US has its issues with corruption - that is a fact 2. All Corruption is bad, which is something it seems you should agree with and 3. if you agree that corruption is bad - you should be against it occurring wherever you reside.  \n\nI'm not sure what you mean as the not being on the \"same footing like people criticized the US. but still living here\" Are you talking economically?\" \n\nAs for deporting people... didn't you hear about the Trump administration's recent internal conversation over birthright v. naturalized citizenship and how the current administration is reviewing the paperwork of people who had been already made citizens?  [LINK]   [LINK]   It has <b> nothing </b>to do with whether or not you are law-abiding, it's about whether or not the powers that be want you here and the lengths they will go to get you out simply because you weren't born here AND because they don't think you fit anymore. \n\nI agree, more Americans do need to travel abroad. My point is that more Americans also need to travel the US. I suggest that you do that too. Travel by car, and depending on how you sound and what you look like you'll see both the beauty and ugliness of the US. I've traveled both and have experienced both. It has been a blessing to do so considering that many can't afford to and I will be the first to say that the US has gotten many things right - but it still does many things badly and it is our duty as citizens to try to achieve that dream we all want as citizens. For everyone born here or not.",

The Trump administration is reviewing the paperwork of naturalized citizens who are law abiding and did not break the law as part of their application process or at any point prior.   With that being said I'm glad you are here and I do agree that the US''s involvement in Vietnam was horrible. Most Americans feel that way. It had a negative impact on many Americans lives and has affected generations. Allowing you rufugees in is the least they can do.

A basic reading of the Koran (it's not that long), shows what the core belief of Islam is, and Ilhan Omar simply is a good representative of that ideology. \n\nIlhan Omar is the new face of the Democratic Party, a party that promotes opening the flood-gates to all Latin-American migrants, and their access to American welfare state. This is feeling-based \"thinking,\" and not practical. It will ruin the finances of America, as the crap-filled streets of California.\n\nIlhan Omar represents the Democrats as CNN represents the mainstream media. Both represent \"diversity\" -- however anti-American a person is -- and an open call for population replacement in America. European men, whose principles built America, are out of style -- feminists say.\n\nIt is important for feminists to shame Western males in America in the most extreme way. CNN represents this excellently, with their predominance of female,<b>  ga<b> y</b</b>>, and non-Western anchors and personalities. CNN represents the degeneracy of America, and aids and abets its destruction.",

I find that her use of the hijab a slap in the face and lack of assimilation into American Democratic society and customs. It is not required by the Koran, but sponsored by a well-financed effort by conservative Muslims to dominate modern Muslim societies. This modern-day movement spreads an ideology of political Islam, called 'Islamism,' enlisting well-intentioned interfaith do-gooders and the media into promoting the idea that the 'hijab' is a virtual 'sixth pillar' of Islam, after the traditional 'five pillars' of the shahada (or proclamation of faith), prayer, fasting, charity and pilgrimage. However, mainstream Muslim women, born in Egypt and India, the spectacle at the mosque was a painful reminder of the well-financed effort by conservative Muslims. This interpretation is rejected by forward thinking contemporary Muslim women that the 'hijab' is merely a symbol of modesty and dignity adopted by faithful female followers of Islam. This modern-day movement, codified by Iran, Saudi Arabia, Taliban Afghanistan and the Islamic State, has erroneously made the Arabic word hijab synonymous with 'headscarf.' This conflation of hijab with the secular word headscarf is misleading. 'Hijab' literally means 'curtain' in Arabic. It also means 'hiding,' 'obstructing' and 'isolating' someone or something. It is never used in the Koran to mean headscarf. It is insulting to me as an American.",

The US was a supporter of Israel long before Muslim monsters attacked the US people on US soil. (And all over the world!!) Im curious - how are Jews treated in the Middle East and Muslim led countries?? Be honest with yourself. Wake the hell up!!  \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",

            "commentText": "There is plenty about the Democrats to criticize but I don't believe that any criticism of Israel is necessarily anti-semitic.  You could point out that Jewish Americans are represented in certain well-compensated and desirable professions many times over the proportion of their numbers in society.  Is it anti-semitic to allude to this situation simply because it might be embarrassing to many Jewish Americans who have realized the benefits?  Something like a third of the richest Americans are Jewish while they comprise a mere 2% of our population. Is pointing out this peculiar situation engaging in anti-semitic speech?  I obtained those figures from an article written many years ago by a Jewish author who was bragging about how superior he thought Jews were to the rest of us and used such details to bolster his argument, which I considered Jewish bigotry.  Shifting to <b> black </b>people, only ten percent of the population, who now have an outsized influence on our culture due primarily to fifty years of Affirmative Action policies.  Most boxers, 90% of professional basketball players, and far more than 50% of football players are<b>  black</b>.  Perhaps they are better athletes than their white counterparts, perhaps the realities of economics makes them more driven to succeed in an area now wide open to them, yet those issues don't readily explain or account for such a skewed reality.  I'll give you one that next t<b> o nobod</b>y ever states:  Why is it wrong for a man to want to ha<b> ve s</b>ex wit<b> h a wo</b>man  when she doesn't <b> want</b> sex with him, pushing the situation widely considered attempted rape, yet w<b> hen a </b>woman wants t<b> o ha</b>ve sex with a man and he does not want <b> to h</b>ave sex with her, he obviously suffers from \"performance issues\" or<b>  mu<b> s</b</b>>t be gay?  How many times have you heard in the media that a man must \"perform\" in several ways in order to<b>  satis</b>fy a woman, yet her \"performance\" is never discussed at all?   All she has to do is lie there, I guess.   By the way, why are white men excluded from Affirmative Action set asides while everyone  else has benefited from them  for decades?  You may as well refer to America as the United States of Abject Hypocrisy, with Democratic women and minorities and homosexuals leading the way on every front.",

I live in Palestine. I have never committed violence against anyone, Israeli or non-Israeli, nor do I know anyone who has. Yet, and despite me being a very smart guy with a lot of potential, a humanitarian, and a pacifist, I've had to live all of my life confined within a city that is getting more crowded every day with no way of expanding or developing because we, as Palestinians, were deprived of all of our natural sources, including ALL bodies of water (rivers, lakes, and the sea), we're not allowed to have an airport, we're not allowed to develop our own technology, and most importantly (and the one that truly hurts my heart the most); we have absolutely no freedom of movement. I've always wanted to go camping, for example. However, going camping would basically be a suicide for me because, even in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority, if I go to the mountains that are less than a Kilometer away from my city, I would be risking getting shot by the Israelis and the settlers who have occupied ILLEGALLY every mountain top in the West Bank (this is the area that was agreed upon to be under the control of the Palestinian Authority). And even if I just want to go visit my friends in nearby Palestinian cities, I would have to go through multiple military checkpoints, with guns aimed at my face throughout the way, and with the risk of being stripped and searched, and possibly not even being allowed to pass through and told to go back to my city.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is, am I anti-semite for seeing the Israeli Government's policies regarding my ordeals (as well as every other Palestinian) as being wrong, inhumane, humiliating, and cruel? And if my view is justified, how come you very easily label anyone in the US as anti-semite for seeing this reality that we live in and pointing it out? How is that considered anti-semtie? And if it is, what exactly does anti-semite mean in this context?\r\n\r\nThank you :)",

I am not getting brain washed by Evangelical zions. I know who it meant its talking about time when jews accepted all the prophets sent by god , god blessed them but today they rejects jesus. This are  People who call jesus as a bastard child of a roman solider  in their Talmud yet bring bible at U.N to get support form Christians that they land belongs to the jews in bible but don't say what this political zions did to jesus just like what they are doing to Palestinians for land . Why would they be gods chosen people if the rejects him? They elects our president by lobby than sucks our tax money dry. make us fight their enemy who fought arab israeli war with lies. iraq has weapon of mass destruction, Syria kills their own civilians. they left egypt and jordan alone because they have peace treaty with israel. Its  all about politics not about Judaism. Go read the bible careful and see what they did to jesus and who god is talking about in what time, this are not the same middle eastern jews. Most of them are European white are they rejects jesus. If bible is talking about people who rejects jesus,  you must be <b> crazy.</b> Your don't know who god's people really means. This people are cursed by god  they were killed, beat up in europe and kicked out form their own land since they rejected jesus remember that and god did<b>  nothing</b> to save 6 million jews. And people like you make them steal lands, kill babys without checking facts what they believe or why shit  happend to them, they are the most hated country in the world.",

You do realize many of the Christian myths were stolen from pagan religions that are thousands of years older than christianity, right? The story of Noah's ark was written by pagans and stolen by men who wanted to put it into the bible. Noah's ark is actually the epic of gilgamesh written thousands of years before your bearded wizard was even invented. Atheism is not a religion, it's quite the opposite. That's like saying creationism is a form of science. Many of your Christian holidays were present in ancient Egypt and samaria long before christianity was invented. The myth of the resurrection of jesus... stolen from ancient Egyptian mythology, but dont take my word for it do your own research. If fairytales work for you, bro, I'm happy for you. Most intellectuals tend to grow out of the fairytales once their brain fully develops and they begin to question religious motives. Do some research on how christianity was invented and evolved from the older religions. You think your story book was ordained by the wizard? Wrong again. A group of men just like you decided which stories to put in your good book. They borrowed myths from older times and grouped them together.",

No!!!\n\nGod called every religion and their teachers, \"you hypocrites\", you honor me with your lips but your hearts are far from me following the Commandments of man and not keeping the commitment of God.  \n\nDevil came in by religion, and has divded the people and has blinded the minds of the people who sit in darkness, of truth of God's Holy scriptures. All God commanded for all humanity is for us to \"Follow Him\" and \"keep my commandments.\" \"Love one another.\"  And judge not unless you be judged.\nAnd We are Christia<b> n Natio</b>n who is found in Christ Jesus, the Great I Am. anyone who does not believe in the Lord thy God we'll meet him one day either as their personal savior or meet him as the judge as in Judgment Day.\nEveryone must obey God law, or die by His law.",

She looks like someone who knows they're being bombarded by questions that were twisted to be turned against them, with no \"right\" answer to those questions, and that as soon as she says what she truly believes she will be constantly attacked, smeared, and standing against numerous lies from all the major media outlets who get paid by...no other than the \"good guys\" that she's being truthful about: AIPAC.\n\nInstead of writing a baseless and utterly non-constructive comment, why don't you put a bit of effort and actually SEARCH for the other side of the story and see which one's more convincing: the multi-billion media outlets that keep repeating the same bullshit over and over again, who spin their words and try to justify wars and the killing of millions even after they have been proven wrong about every single war they're propagated, or the independent media outlets that show you the FULL story and don't cut/paste parts of speeches and interviews just to make people believe a certain agenda while covering the truth.",

                    "commentText": "@suijurispeacemaker  Let's dissect your argument, shall we?\n\n1- \"It's all about the Benjamins\" is a very smart sentence with 3 different layers of meanings, and it is far smarter than some of the \"humorous\" remarks and comments that most American politicians make. In her sentence, the Benjamins refer to both $$ and Benjamin Netenyahu, both of which are very related to her argument regarding AIPAC and how they're buying off politicians. On the very surface, the sentence has a cultural appeal and grabs attention because of its relation to the rap song. This is called smart commenting, and in an <b> age </b>where millennials are the future, she's using the language that appeals to them instead of using the same<b>  old</b> boring, less meaningful, deceitful, and misleading language that most politicians use.\n\n2- If you want to learn about why she supports BDS, you can search it to find an answer. She's in no way obliged to tackle all aspects of her argument based on a series of back and forth tweets that smear her and label her as anti-Semitic. She's a smart lady, and she knows that the best audience to target are intellectuals; those are people who are willing to seek the truth on their own without anyone else shoving \"the truth\" down their throats (which is what the mainstream media does and wants for all people).\n\n3- When you have a corrupt government that is fucking up every aspect of the American society, who lies so blatantly, and that has been proven wrong on so many different occasions in the past 20 years, the people in this government lose their credibility. Their opinions about who's right and who's wrong becomes obsolete. It's like letting a murderer be the judge of someone else's trial who's being accused of committing the murderer's crime. Besides, your politicians criticize each other left and right all the time, why doesn't it mean anything except when you want it to mean something? This is called cherry-picking in an argument. It's a<b> n ol</b>d and very misleading and misguiding technique, and it only works on people who aren't smart or who lack any will to put some effort into learning the truth.\n\n4- Should I even comment on her using the congress as a social media? You argue that she fucked up because Trump said so. Trump...TRUMP! Have you even seen his Twitter account and how he uses it? Again, you're cherry-picking. You're smearing her for using social media, but you trust the opinion of your president, who uses social media more than any other politician in the history of America!\n\n5- You're saying she's putting Islam first and that she's not doing anything to bring Americans together. Can you back this up with ANY facts or evidence? Because I can easily say the same about literally any other politician, and it wouldn't mean shit without any evidence. You can say that it's your opinion that she's doing that, but you can't state it as a fact without evidence. This is what the mainstream media does, so I don't blame you for being brainwashed to think it's an acceptable argument technique. But, in reality, it is not, and it mea<b> ns nothi</b>ng but a fictional sentence as far as I'm concerned.\n\nI would appreciate a thorough answer and a constructive argument without misleading and deceitful techniques, if you don't mind, and if you intend to reply :)\n\nThank you.",

                    "commentText": "@suijurispeacemaker But the thing about US politics is that it affects people all around the world, as well as the American people, and the only way to make any changes in that is by being a part of these politics in order to change them.\n\nYou say she should speak about America and its people, but that is what she's doing. Here are two ways to look at it:\n1- She's talking about AIPAC, which is a US based Israeli lobby that does, in fact, affect America and its people by influencing and controlling the policies that govern them.\n2- When she talks about foreign policies, she's also talking about something that drastically affects America and its people. America's foreign policies have two very major negative effects on its all Americans:\nA) The regime change wars that the US is committing against countries in the Middle East and in Latin America are effectively increasing the number of people around the world who hate America, who can in turn become terrorists, and who might then attack Americans in the US or in other countries around the world. The US has <b> nothing </b>to do with other countries' politics or regimes, and it has no place in policing them, especially when Americans don't want people from other countries being part of their government or affecting their policies. This is called sovereignty, and the US government should respect it in other countries as it wants other countries to respect it for them.\nB) The American government spends more on military than the other top 9 countries in the world, and for what? To change regimes in other countries and increase the amount of aggression that others have towards the US? This is severely counter-productive when you think in terms of National Security, so it's logical to think that there's an agenda behind it (war is a very profitable industry, and the biggest profiteers are the same people who pay millions of dollars to US politicians to sway their opinions and affect their policies, but that's an entirely different topic that we can talk about if you want). The point here is that all of this money that is spent on counter-productive \"national security\" could be easily spent on drastically improving the quality of life for all Americans, provide free health-care and education, and drastically raise the level of minimum wage for US citizens. That is the main reason why Ilhan Omar, as well as many other emerging US politicians are trying to take part in US politics and are actively speaking against wars, and it is the exact same reason why they're being attacked by both the left and the right, who are both profiting from lobbies who in tern profit from the wars that the US is waging all around the world.",

So, please bare with me, and I hope you don't mind reading all of it:\n\nI am a Palestinian. I live in Palestine. I have never committed violence against anyone, Israeli or non-Israeli, nor do I know anyone who has. Yet, and despite me being a very smart guy with a lot of potential, a humanitarian, and a pacifist, I've had to live all of my life confined within a city that is getting more crowded every day with no way of expanding or developing because we, as Palestinians, were deprived of all of our natural sources, including ALL bodies of water (rivers, lakes, and the sea), we're not allowed to have an airport, we're not allowed to develop our own technology, and most importantly (and the one that truly hurts my heart the most); we have absolutely no freedom of movement. I've always wanted to go camping, for example. However, going camping would basically be a suicide for me because, even in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority, if I go to the mountains that are less than a Kilometer away from my city, I would be risking getting shot by the Israelis and the settlers who have occupied ILLEGALLY every mountain top in the West Bank (this is the area that was agreed upon to be under the control of the Palestinian Authority). And even if I just want to go visit my friends in nearby Palestinian cities, I would have to go through multiple military checkpoints, with guns aimed at my face throughout the way, and with the risk of being stripped and searched, and possibly not even being allowed to pass through and told to go back to my city.\n\nSo, my question is, am I anti-semite for seeing the Israeli Government's policies regarding my ordeals (as well as every other Palestinian) as being wrong, inhumane, humiliating, and cruel? And if my view is justified, how come you very easily label anyone in the US as anti-semite for seeing this reality that we live in and pointing it out? How is that considered anti-semtie? And if it is, what exactly does anti-semite mean in this context?\n\nThank you :)",

To answer your question, no it is not Anti-Semitic to be against Israel and it's policies. I believe in a 2 state solution for Palestine. I said in my comment I don't see the comment Omar made here as particularly Anti-Semitic. Anti-Semitism is a real concern and is defiantly real. I hope you can go camping some day and are free to roam ! When that time comes, have a marshmallow for me !",

This amounts to over $10 million per day to a <b> nation </b>which currently provides universal health care to its citizens, offers 15 weeks to new mothers in paid leave and guarantees a higher education to all citizens at extremely low cost relative to U.S. standards. We are not allowed to even dream of such a social safety net for ourselves or our children, yet our taxes go towards securing those programs and more elsewhere. CNN is complicit in this great American robbery each time they fail to report these things in full context. Make no mistakes about it, corporate media are bought and paid for by the same corrupting entities that have captured our democracy. CNN's reporting here is<b>  nothing</b> short of journalistic malpractice of the highest order.

However, I think it is safe to say that based on everything I have seen her post on the subject that her beef is with money in politics, whatever its source. It just makes sense in a system where the Supreme Court has equated money with speech that those with more money have more freedom of speech. Omar's mistake, it would seem, is that there is not enough money backing up her position. So she must lose this debate. Lobbyist organizations, of which AIPAC is only one example, will use whatever tools at their disposal, including public shaming of individuals who don't support them, in order to maintain their power and control. This can be the only outcome of a system where money equals power and access. I support Omar for her timorous courage in taking on the behemoths in our corrupt system. I do think she could have approached the subject more skillfully, but Twitter does not lend itself to skillful speech. She did rather poke the bear.",

In my view it's a sign that the part of the American public that is still capable of independent thinking is far more mature, intelligent and humane than the Establishment political parties. It's wonderful that there is this fresh and dynamic new generation that is involved in politics and that actually gets elected, like Omar, AOC and others, who aren't afraid to speak out against the <b> old </b>taboos, like criticizing capitalism and Israel's<b>  ethnic</b> cleansing policies toward Palestinians. It's also heartening that even the mainstream media are beginning to deal with these issues. Maybe in the end Trump's presidency isn't all bad because its sheer disgustingness has unleashed this healthy wind of change.",

How can the republicans, democrats and trump call for her to resign when this president makes more <b> racist </b>rants in one day and the lawmakers don't say boo. Hypocrisy at its finest. Our politicians back Israel without reservation. The idea that a Junior senator voicing her personal opinions is ridiculous.  \nSo much for the first amendment.  Apparently the idea of freedom of speech is to much for people to handle. Whats next, loss of freedom of expression? Or does that pertain to only those of the catholic religion. You can't expect only some of the people to act accordingly when the leader of the country can act, say ,or doing anything that they want without repercussion. The rules apply to all .",

I am all for protecting everyones rights be you jewish or otherwise,  but I didn't see an anti-semetic statement here.  I saw an anti - Isreal one,  and I'm not sure she is wrong.  A big part of why we are allies with Iran is because we make a good deal of money from their country. Is that just not how trade works?  We make money from you,  you make money from us...?   There are also military advantages that are being overlooked in her statement though.   Being a Jewish country doesn't have anything to do with it as far as I can see.  But that is just my opinion.",

Last week, the Senate passed a bill sponsored by Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) that would permit state and local governments to deny contracts to corporations and government entities (such as public universities) that use their financial muscle to voice opposition to the government of Israel through boycott, divestment, or economic sanctions\u2014'BDS' for short. It's no surprise that Senator Rubio's bill\u2014known as the Combating BDS Act of 2019\u2014has drawn criticism from the ACLU and other groups that oppose government impingement on freedom of speech.  \n\nThe BDS movement is a legitimate boycott against an apartheid state. Israel has become exactly like the former South Africa with its own Bantustan in Gaza and the West Bank. The only solution is the type of boycott that changed South Africa.",

Jesus was teaching the Jews the right way to be saved. some Jews followed him and became Christians others countinued their own beliefs and thought him as a prophet but not the Son of God. Now in Revelations it says that when Jesus comes down then the Jews will know he is the Son of God and they will bow down and ask for forgiveness and will be foregiven and be saved. His word was spread around the world and that's how Christianity was spread through his disciples and then the Christian faithful followers.",

Tou havent seen their ,and I'm dead serious here, submarines, you havent seen how the mules swallow drug filled balloons,  you havent seen how they fill items in cargo containers on freighters? My point is with so much money to be made in selling drugs , the resources wasted on a wall is idiotic at best, and criminal at worst. If you're serious about stopping drug smugglers, just legalize all drugs. Instantly cartels will crumble, people will be happier, jobs will be created, prison population will decrease, tax revenue will increase, Overdose deaths will plummet, police forces will shrink, and addiction rates will drop. Yes , I know it sounds counterintuitive that addiction rates will drop but it's TRUE. A lot of the resources gained can be allocated to free treatment facilities. This is a no brainers. The main reason certain drugs are illegal is ignorance and lobbying by big pharma. Fact is, only 20% of EVERYONE who tries cocaine becomes addicted. No one who tries marijuana becomes physically addicted, pharmaceutical companies created the opioid epidemic for profit, if heroine was legal that would have never happened. Most psychedelics actually have beneficial <b> mental </b>health effects and none are addictive. So can anyone explain why a substance used for recreational purposes can be made illegal?",

The things I was referring. to were mentioned in previous tweets.  1 of them was \"America will not be for white people\"\nAnyway, she has a lot of anger in her and a lot of hate. She doesn't seem to have a great political mind.  Things that are obvious to most people seem to be way above her.  She's relying way too much on her Somalian voters in Minnesota and should be thinking about the future of the Democratic Party.   It makes no sense to me to piss off every <b> race </b>of voter and 80% of the party who I guarantee are thinking about ways to get rid of her.  She causes way to much damage and the reason Pelosi keeps on defending her is not because she likes her, but quite the opposite.  She might be voted out or maybe they will restructure her district or maybe try and get her impeached through the tax fraud thing she got caught for.  But who knows, she might become the new leader of the Democrat Party.  I don't care for her because America saved her from a pretty shitty situation, but she doesn't feel privileged with her new Country and amazing job and great Salary.  Seems to come off as a bitter person who is entitled to not only be here, but feels we should feel lucky to have her.  Again, Im talking past tweets about the bad place  America is but not a word about the countries people are fleeing from, so it's really hard to take her seriously.  Sounds like  America is not the worst Country in the world but in the top 5.  I'm not sure if she said this, but you should read her tweets, if there is a<b>  race</b> she hasn't offended it would be Somalian Blacks.  I don't think she can get away with this for much longer.  There is a line you don't cross, and she's crossed them all.  It is entertaining though.",

Yassir Arafat  has talked with Israel but made no peace. But King Abdullah II of Jordan has made a peace treaty with Israel, and fully recognizes Israel. So does Egypt. Hate is not the answer.

The Jews are considered lesser beings because they're successful, well-educated, and have the only western-style democracy in the Middle East.  Therefore, they cannot be a member of the dispossessed in the U.S.  That leaves open season for<b>  lunatic</b> fringe radicals, from Socialists to antisemitic Muslims, to launch constant attacks against them with Nazi-style tactics.  The pro-BDS movement isn't just about pushing the right of Muslims to wipe Israel off the map, but also boycott Jewish businesses and communities - a tactic pushed by Hamas (terror group) and admittedly lifted from Hitler's playbook.  The only time the Democrats give two fucks about Jews is when they can use them as a club to bash Republicans.  They tell Donald Trump to denounce antisemitism, with his Jewish son-in-law, Jewish daughter, Jewish associates, American Embassy moved to Jerusalem, and declaring Jerusalem the capital.  But Ilhan Omar and Talaib get to throw out all the antisemitic, pro-terror propaganda they want.  AOC gets to pal around with Jeremy Corbin, a rabid antisemitic prick.  Linda Sarsour still leads the Women's March, accepted by Democrats, and everyone gets to hang with Louis Farakhan, who openly called Jews \"termites\" and vowed support for those who would kill them.\n\nFuck you, Democrats!  Fuck you, Socialists!  Fuck you, BDS Movement!  And most of all - fuck the Intersection Coalition and their Victimhood Hierarchy, that allows people to be openl<b> y racis</b>t against anyone lower than them on the totem pole!",

These bullies roll all these criticisms into one category and accuse Israel's critics of being Anti-Semitic.  They paint the critics with the same broad brush they would use to paint a <b> Nazi </b>with two objectives in mind: \r\n\r\nThey want to intimidate Israel's critics into silence to avoid being ostracized as bigots.\r\nThey hope their hominem attack will confuse those who might listen to the critics and cause them to discount anything they say.\"",

And if u want to talk about hitler let's talk about hitler. Hitler was a Christian if he really loved Muslims and wanted Germany to be an Islamic State then he would've been a Muslim. In Islam killing means ur out of the religion... in fact hitler did not want Islam to spread in his country. And if u focused in ur history classes he believed that only Christian Caucasians deserved to live and most Arabs are light brown.... ur point about hitler is just some fantasy shit that everyone knows is not right....",

And over their civilians are found and they were given the job by hamas. If u want to call that human shields it's your opinion but I don't. Plus they also bomb schools but they give a 5 minute notice on Twitter for gazans to evacuate how humane right ? And hamas bombing Israel they will obviously bomb Israel because Israel bombs them and the target of hamas is to bring back Palestine and give Palestinians their homes back from the river to the sea and all Palestinians want that actually most of the world except the super powers. And no they never stopped any election in fact fatah is the one rejecting an election on the west back because they know 100% hamas would win because hamas is the only group that has the target of giving every Palestinian his house back.",

No they don't, If they stopped the occupation and let the Palestinians vote they would easily be the majority in the region and just oust them by vote. That's what Israel fears the most. And Israeli refuge should not come in detriment of others basic rights or by annexation! Didn't the US sanction Russia for annexing Crimea? There is no argument there. It's a world consensus except for Israel and the US",

Also, as said before, they need to defend themselves, which the UN just wants them to have their hands tied. No one would accept the Jews back in after the holocaust. It was dangerous because of the remaining anti semitism. Therefore, they wanted a place to call their home which is an insanely small portion of the land.",

That American politicians are being bribed to benefit other nations?\nIt cannot be proven easily or directly; otherwise, it would have already been a scandal. \n\nLiberal or Republican, you need to know where your loyalty lies and what American interests are. It does not matter if politicians were bribed or not, what matters is the fact that unconstitutional laws are being installed by representatives from both sides of the political spectrum. \n\nAnti-BDS laws will not only allow laws that limit boycotting Israel but it may also allow American companies to ask for the same limitations on consumers. These policies are not in the United States' interests (especially if you're a citizen).",

She was right by criticising the awful country called Israel and their many violent actions against humanity, but tweeting about it in that way did not help the cause and it could have caused grief among Jews in America. Israel has a history of being connected with the USA because of their Jewish culture. Saying that the US only supports Israel because of money is hurtful to not only Jews in the USA but Jews from all around the world.",

Started in on Israel right off the bat and then forgot about her constituents back home and the problems we face here in Minnesota. Okay, I'm not real happy with the Jewish State of Israel either (treatment of Palestinians) but at this time she needed to build a collision with others in Congress before putting her foot in her mouth.  She wanted to make a splash like AOC...Should jump that train instead and maybe after she will get the help she needs with Israel.  Too bad...I liked and voted for her, maybe this is too much, too soon.  Try not to overreach in the future or we will have to find a new person for your seat.",

CNN'll pump that onto the air and everyone at the airport will hear it because for some reason the airport tubes are tuned into the drivel channel. CNN.

The hatred against Jews in general and Israel particular is <b> old,</b> and the orchestrated strategy against Israel in particular goes back to 1973, when the Arab states realized they just could not defeat Israel militarily - so they launched propaganda campaigns against Israel (and if you are not Arab, you have taken the bait).\n\nThese are the same countries that never accepted Arabs living in the area which is Israel (subsequently called \"Palestinians\" by Yasser Arafat, the founder of the Palestinian movement in the 1960's), by keeping them in<b>  refugee</b> camps without citizenship. Note that the same number (just over 1/2 million) Jews moved from Arab and Nort<b> h Africa</b>n countries at the time Israel defeated its neighbors and to become a country itself back in 1948. \n\nPalestinians continue to be used as a pawn in order to try and destroy Israel as a Jewish state. It's a shame, because all that energy could have been (and still can be) used for the development of technological/medical/other advances that help everyone. Israelis moved past the negativity, and continue to produce for themselves and anyone who is willing to cooperate.\n\nOh, and you talk about \"atrocities<b> .\" Nothi</b>ng Israel has ever done to the group now called The Palestinians (or Palestinians have ever done to Israel, for that matter) even compares numerically with <b> the Bl</b>ack September 1970: When the Jordanian leadership slaughtered 14,000 Palestinian loyalists after they had committed plane hijackings and other crimes.

The deal that Obama signed before leaving, gave Israel an extra $800M/year but required all of it to be spent on U.S contractors instead of only 75% of it as in the previous deal. No matter the president, it boils down to the U.S government saying we wont arm you, but we will give you money to buy weapons from us. So if you think about it, a good chunk of the $50 billions/year we spend on foreign aid is really money going strait to corp America.

Also to note, do you know all the financial aid Israel grants to the Palestinians? They also offer citizenship there for them. Let's call it as it is, without aid from the US Jews would be slaughtered by their neighboring countries. They hate them not because of occupation but because of ideology. Don't let them fool you. Anti demotion is rising all across Europe, what's so wrong about them wanting a small state to call their refuge? They tried to be peaceful but the palestians immediately hated them because they were Jewish.

The thing is Islam is the fastest growing faith/ideology so it should be taken seriously if appr 300 million people are so radical and on top of that many other muslim although wouldnt kill anyone but would happily live under Sharia and perhaps even if it means disclepine the jews.\n\nSide not im not religious at all.

Further, the American people should be extremely concerned about elected officials and/or Pres appointed positions to those with dual citizenship. Ex: Israel & US citizenship. Questioning Israeli policies does not equate to anti-Semitism. Further, for those who are unaware, Arabs are Semites..  the word Semite does not apply to the Jews only, therefore, the Jews cannot patent the word Semite as their own. Lastly, Ilhan called for Saudi Arabia's policies.. calling for a boycott against the Sauds. Does this make her a \"Self Hating Muslim\" too?",

If you were able to verify Wolfowitz was Jewish, you are capable of looking up what countries allow dual citizenship. I could go into Raum's and Chertoff's family backgrounds, but did not. Also, I could go into their current business ventures, but did not.

Let's look at their contributions to their citizens- the world- and world peace.. I wonder why we are not hearing more about that from her. You want her to speak the truth!? Lol, You never will. She is a sheep perpetuating victim hood. Her own comments start to congress of how she is such a victim. Wow. Jesus fucking Christ. Go move somewhere else then,Unless she has a complete transformation and educational overhaul she has no place in American politics. Convince me otherwise. Go!",

More research needs to be done on that. Sensitivity is slightly reduced, but the more sexually sensitive areas of the penis are the glans (head), and moreso at the shaft's underside just below glans. The advantage is reduction of bacterial, fungal and viral infections - and it is the viruses (if not adequately washed under the foreskin) that put female partners of uncircumcised males at risk of developing cancer of the cervix. \nFGM is practiced in different forms but the most extreme entails removal of the clitoris, which (you may know) is the female embryonic equivalent of the penis itself. Girls have prolonged (but variable) pain, followed by loss of sensitivity, followed by the inability to achieve orgasm or any real <b> sexual </b>arousal. Thanks for asking. I can elaborate further, but that's the gist.",

Yes, her own shithead dirtbag countrymen ripped their own shit apart. The US didn't get involved until 1993, and that was because the civil war had degenerated into medieval warlords shit, and the skinnies were starving. We tried to save the rat skunks from their own shittiness, and we got the bodies of our soldiers dragged through the streets as a thank you.\n\nIt's amazing how these assholes can just flat out lie, and, not only doesn't it get held against them, they're lionized as heroes for telling the bold and brave mistruths which support the fictitious anti-American narrative. \n\nIt's fucking disgusting.",

By the end of the 80's their were dozens of political action committees or PACs with no formal relation to AIPAC but whose leader was often a member. The Wall street Journal further reports that in 1987 that at least 51 of 80 pro Israel PACs were operated by AIPAC officials.\n    Furthermore, between the 2000 and 2004 elections the 50 members of AIPAC's board donated an average of $72,000 each to campaigns and PACs.\n     With regards to paid lobbyists. I can name one..Howard Kohr, executive director of AIPAC, who in 2009 stood before the House Committee on Appropriations' Foreign Operations Subcommittee and requested that Israel receive $2.775 billion in military aid for fiscal 2010.

If she would spread the hatred around a little then you would have a point and say she's just sticking up for Americans.  But she always picks on the same people or on  all the usual suspects.  She seems to think she's invincible, because she always gets away with it.  I mean it's a stupid move politically and she's putting too much faith in her Somalian voters thinking they will always support her.  Maybe the Democrats will get so sick of her, that they will say,  you know that small voter base we have in Minnesota.  I think California needs a new congress person there more than Minnesota does.  After all, Mexicans are the future more than a few thousand  Somalians.  They probably can't do that but either someone will get sick of her or maybe they can put a way more popular candidate to run against her if they feel she's a threat to their party with her extreme left wing bias.",

There is <b> nobody </b>on the other side I think is not either deep state or a globalist. <b>  Nobody</b> has any concern over the border issue and they think that's what the voters want.  Unfortunately I think the border issue is a main concern for Republican voters but I think Dem voters it is not a concern and should not be an issue for the party to bother with.  Besides, unless you live in a southern state it probably doesn't seem to affect you.  People from all over the world coming in to the country illegally is ok, and it would b<b> e racis</b>t to not let them in.  But this is a little different than in the passed when you see mass immigration all over the world all happening in the last seven years all at once it's pretty obvious to me that somebody with money is changing the way America was and this change does not benefit the Americans  When you bring the 3rd world to your country, you become the 3rd world.  Remember the people make the country, the country doesn't make the people.  There is a bright side, that when this happens immigrants will no longer want to come.",

Some support the Israel gov because they want anyone who is Jewish to have a safe country they can live in if they want to. Some because they believe the bible says it is theirs. Some because they believe the bible says that the Jews need to control the region and have a huge war with Iran in order for Jesus to return. Those with that belief don't care about who dies in the war because they think Christians will be safe in that case. Some are for Israel because they are full on antisemitic and want segregation. Some support Israel gov because of lobbyists. Finally, some just want to avoid being labeled as antisemitic but they don't care about any of the other reasons. I'm sure I've missed some, but that gives you an overview. On the flip side, there may be just as many reasons that someone may be against the Israel gov. Not all of them are because someone is against jews or the jewish religion. You really need to look at why someone is for or against to understand.",

I have seen some of the most disgusting, openly antisemitic comments on here from supposed \"liberals\" in solidarity with Ilhan Omar, that it honestly puts the dirtbags at the neo-Nazi rallies to shame.  The neo-Nazis are fringe of the Right, and they're absolutely treated like the fringe.  I have never seen comments like I've seen on here, where people are just parroting neo-Nazi propaganda in the guise of supporting Ilhan Omar.  Ilhan Omar has been disgustingly antisemitic for a long time, so there's really no defending her on that issue.  I just find it detestable at the level of antisemitism that the left is not only willing to tolerate, but how much of it is actually gripping people here on the CNN page.",

I was born in indonesia and grew up there for 20+ years before i moved to another country. The amount of ridiculous hate towards israel and jews is astonishingly HIGH\nout of pure ignorance, nearly all of them don't even check on things on, say, how the occupation starts, etc\nthey just act , with their ignorance , to be pro palestine and extremely anti semitic with jews and israel, without even meeting a jew (no viable jewish community in indonesia  at all)\nso their stance exist solely because of: their islamic affiliation, and ampified by the very very biased reporting to demonize israel and victimize palestinians and hamas\n\nall in all, you can check it yourself no? things like\n- how did the occupation starts? (arab muslims own action, they invaded and lost, twice ganking and them and lost twice)\n- israel has been proposing 2 state solution 5 times since their indepence, after they won the muslim arab coalition invasion. Who rejected all of them? palestine (in the early proposals they even proposing to go back to the original british given lines, for CO-EXISTENCE)\n- while israel is not perfect itself , have you forgot to compare it to nearby muslim nations in the region? under their hand, israel becomes the most proggressive and advanced <b> nation </b>in the whole north african-middle eastern region. Their citizens are mainly secular, and muslims here (20% of israelis are arab muslims) are living a live with better quality and freedom than muslims in islamic nations nearby. Do you see that to be the case with , say,  christians or hindus in those islamic nations? far worse, let alone to jews\n- even after winning both wars, israel RETURNS its gained land to jordan and egypt (large area too) just for the sake of CO-EXISTENCE with them, even after those nations literally tried to vanguish them before and they lost. Israel propose this as a WINNER in a battle those enemies started, not as a loser, and they still do this for the sake of peace\n- in early 2000s, they actually pulled back from gaza strip, giving them more liberty for that. What did those palestinians in gaza did? elect HAMAS group (which clearly stated their main goal is eradication of israel), as the governing power. So much for peace-lovers and co-existence eh? With this situation, is it surprising that they become more wary about leaving west bank when the other part simply use their gained freedom to attack israel? \n\ntell me, which islamic nations in the region do it better? the closest you can get is lebanon but thats simply because half of them are christian arabs",

Trump is also a SYMPTOM of a profoundly dysfunctional fear and hate-based malignant segment of our society who, in a constant state of self-pity, blame their own failures on all of the 'unfair' people who caused them to fail. \u00a0 Trumpites FAILURE to take responsibility for their circumstance is the foundation of their misfortune. The following are symptoms of their DISFUNCTION:\u00a0 Q-anon, Alex Jones, White Power, <b> Nazi </b>sickos, Worshiping \"Stongman Trump\" (so laughable), and worst of all, the HYPOCRITE Christians who say Trump is a friend of Jesus (Why insult Jesus! so disgusting!).",

I will provide but one response, so as not to waste one second more than necessary **what items are you referring to. How can you accuse me of lacking a response whilst in the middle of your first response to me**: the quotes by Martin Luther King. Most of us consider him a fairly accurate judge of what is right. He supported Israel as a Jewish <b> nation.</b> As referenced, you did not comment on that. \n** What you have a country do that disagrees with another countries policies? Countries sanction each other so show disapproval** no major argument there. The problem arises when Israel is singled out for criticism in international bodies, while much worse offenders are not even referenced due to collaboration with those with similar interests (Muslim majority countries, for example). \n** Sanctioning Iran and Russia didn't collapse due to our sanction and neither will isreal** many countries have sanctioned Israel. They are building coalitions with countries such as India and Brazil, but still do need to the political backing of the US due to the asymmetric coalitions (by raw numbers in international bodies) in order to remain secure. \n*What about the existence of Palestinians? Their land is occupied and being built over. Their villages are being demolished.* I also empathize with the Palestinians. Just think, they were given the entire Gaza strip, replete with infrastructure that included Green Houses for agricultural development when Ariel Sharon forced Israelis out of there in 2005, in order to see if they could put together a productive society. Instead the Palestinians destroyed much of it due to being \"Jewish\",  elected Hamas, and their government subsequently set of a strategy of attacking Israel via rocket fire and tunnels. This is the same story of Palestinians attacking Jordan from the West Bank via<b>  terrorist</b> acts inclusive of plane hijackings in the 1970's. The difference? Jordan responded with th<b> e Blac</b>k September (1970) massacre of 14K Palestinians. When it is the Palestinians that never were granted citizenship in any Arab state after the 1948 war (98% of Mideast land mass), while Jews from other countries were granted citizenship in Israel to join other Jews and endemic Christians and Muslims. One group of people accepts all religious faiths, while another does not....that's why the reference to the growth of the Christian population within Israel.",

You need to go put your cellphone down and read a book, any book. First go read about the history of Jews in middle<b>  age</b> Europe. If you do you will see how Christians systematically segregated Jews in ghettos. Burned them out of said ghettos, stole their property, killed them and scape goated them for the governing state's malfeasance,  REPEATEDLY. It was Christians sweet heart who did this for close to a thousand years. Hmmm let's take a look at present day India and it's conservative Hindu majority prime ministr who was  complicit in up what amounted t<b> o ethni</b>c cleansing in Gujarat in the 2002. Or how followers of the Dali Lama's sect of Tibetan Buddhism have assassinated followers of its rival sect. Bottom line, no one religion has monopoly on righteousness nor evil. It's the people and their ambitions and fears that drive those misdeeds. Stop being so simpleminded it just makes you a tool for those who don't have your best interest at heart..",

Where have you been? Seriously. Meanwhile you have a self professed white christian man that slaughtered Jewish worshipers in a Pittsburgh, PA synagogue. A white Christian man who slaughtered<b>  black</b> worshipers in their church before that both of whom probably would shot you too simply for being Chinese and an atheist. As for climate change - that is pretty simple you eat less meat, use less plastic, walk or use public transit, stop throwing things away and repair them, stop wasting water, stop shooting fire works (one of the best things the Chinese government has done which the US needs to follow suit). As far as the situation with the Ujigars, you reap what you sow and know that your descendants will pay the price of brutality exercised by their parents in their names.
