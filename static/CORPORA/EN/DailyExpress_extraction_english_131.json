', 'It's staggering that Corbyn's Labour see fit to lecture people about race and faith while they are investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for the rampant anti-Semitism in their ranks, she added.', 'Mr Corbyn faced an exodus of MPs over his failures to tackle anti - Semitism in his party. ', 'Ahead of his speech, he said: Labour is the party of equality and human rights. Our race and faith manifesto presents our unshakeable commitment to challenge the inequalities and discrimination that has faced too many communities.', ' Whatever your background, wherever you are from, whatever your faith or religious belief, you should have the chance to use your talents to fulfil your potential.Labour will tackle head on the barriers that have unfairly held back so many people and communities.'",

Since capitalism was necessary to make any form of trade work i.e. currency his utopia could never come about, it sort of works on collective farms but trade still needs to take place which always creates capitalism. We have to separate the Marxist RELIGION  from what is an academic paper no better than Sigmund Freud's , or Darwinism which Eugenicists who never in fact read or understood the work took it out of context e.g. in Darwinism, the belief is in survival of the fittest when Darwin had evolution based on cooperation.",

            "commentText": "Frederick Douglass was most impressed with the colour blindness of the British. In all public conveyances, inns and restaurants he was received on equal terms with whites. In contrast to the United States where he was caricatured, scoffed, scorned, mocked and maltreated with impunity by anyone with a white skin. In England he met <b> nothing </b>to remind me of my complexion. He discovered that the British measure and esteem men according to their moral and intellectual worth, and not according to the color of their skin. While in England he raised $710 and purchased his freedom which he was unable to find in white America, the plans he had for the future could only be carried out by a free man! In 1845 his two year lecture tour here was received with enormous praise and popularity, often speaking for two hours, sometimes to thousands of people who would line up to shake his hand after each event. Here he was able to denounce the Englishmen acting in concert with southern slave holders, stress human brotherhood and argue that slavery was the<b>  common</b> enemy of mankind. This will not help the Marxist lectures Corbyn has in mind and the bondage he will project onto us as a result ",

The greatest trading <b> nation </b>the world has seen and the country that gave the world the Industrial revolution. All these countries are still incredibly grateful about what we did for them as I have found out from my working life travelling the world as an engineer. The greatest inventions and discoveries have come from this country. Todays youth and all the people educated by the left wing teachers at schools and Universities also need some of these truths exlaining to them all the good we did as well as the bad things we did. I 'm sick of these people and wish they would get out of my country, the greatest country in the world. Why is it illegal immigrants and asylum seekers pass through many european countries which are safe to get here ?",

Unlike Mr.Corbyn I have been to many countries in Africa.On a number of occasions I have been told by locals that they wish the British would come back, especially in Sudan, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana and Gambia. This is because, since these and other countries have gained independence, they have been beset by corruption, oppression, failure of public services, infiltration of terrorism, military posturing, etc. It is the evils of socialism that should be taught to children.",
