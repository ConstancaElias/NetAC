        "postText": "Ms Swinson believes the live TV debate is an \u201cestablishment stitch-up\u201d made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman said it \u201cwould take a miracle\u201d for the Remain MP to walk into Downing Street on December 12. She said: \u201c You\u2019ve said this is sexist. Isn\u2019t it the reality that it\u2019s not sexism, it\u2019s realism that the two main credible candidates for Prime Minister are the ones who should get the scrutiny in a head-to-head debate?\u201d', 'Speaking to Channel 4 News, Ms Swinson said: \u201cI\u2019m a candidate to be Prime Minister of this country.\u201d', 'Ms Newman interjected: \u201cYou\u2019re a candidate but you\u2019re not going to get there, are you?\u201d', 'Ms Swinson continued: \u201cThat\u2019s not up to you or to any other journalist, that\u2019s up to the voters or this country.', '\u201cWe\u2019re in a very volatile time in politics and I just say to political journalists, are there any predictions in the past few years that have been spectacularly wrong?', '\u201cMany people didn\u2019t think Jeremy Corbyn would become leader of the Labour Party or that Donald Trump would become president.', '\u201cBack in the 2015 election we saw the SNP go from 6 to 56 MPs in Scotland.', '\u201cSo we\u2019ve not been a stranger to political surprises.\u201d', 'Ms Newman added: \u201cThe polling average, Conservatives 37 percent, Labour 27 percent, Liberal Democrats 17.', '\u201cPut that together with the electoral system, it would take a miracle to put you into No10.\u201d', 'Ms Swinson responded: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely possible. If you look at those polling averages they are actually very similar to where we were polling in the 2010 election.', '\u201cYet in 2010 we had leadership debates that were three-way debates, Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg - three men.', '\u201cWhen it comes to a similar polling situation, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, I\u2019m excluded.\u201d', 'Her comments come as ITV has planned to host a live TV debate between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn in the run-up to the election.', 'Ms Swinson labelled the move \u201csexist\u201d and is considering legal action against the broadcaster.', 'Sky News have proposed plans to hold a debate between all three leaders.', 'Ms Swinson has already agreed and called out the others on Twitter.",
