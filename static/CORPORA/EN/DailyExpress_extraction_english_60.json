        "postText": "'Tui has been accused of encouraging gender stereotypes with free stickers onboard.', 'They were handed out to children on a flight from Bristol to Paphos, Cyprus last week.', 'Dame Gillian Morgan, 65, noticed at passport control the stickers which had been given to each gender.', 'She admitted that, while the stickers themselves were gender neutral, the way they were handed out created the problem.', 'She told Metro: We desperately need more women to do science, maths and engineering but little things like this take us backwards by providing restricting roles.', 'Morgan wasn\u2019t the only one frustrated with the move, as others took to Twitter to complain.', 'One user remarked: \u201cLovely touch by @TUIUK flying out to Corfu Friday by giving children TUI stickers and activity sheet.', 'Not so lovely that all the boys were given \u2018future pilot\u2019 stickers and the girls \u2018future cabin crew\u2019?! Sexist much?', 'Some didn\u2019 t agree, with one commenting: Oh come on, the stickers are for children, they don 't know about sexism. It's adults that cause such nonsense.', 'Tui, formally Thomson Airways, issued a statement on the issue, advising it was not intentional.', 'They explained: We\u2019re sorry to hear a small number of customers have been upset by this', 'We think it has just been a simple mix-up since our future pilot and cabin crew stickers are designed for use for any child regardless of gender.', 'The stickers are part of our activity packs which are intended to be used by crew to interact, engage with and create special moments for our customers on their holiday.', 'The feedback we\u2019ve had so far this summer has been overwhelmingly positive.', 'Children fall in love with flying when they go on their holidays with us and we want to encourage their dreams of becoming future pilots and crew members.', 'A woman tried to sue an airline in 2016, citing sexism when travelling to Israel.', 'The elderly woman stated she was asked to give up her seat at the request of a man on the plane who was ultra-orthodox.', 'Their religion states that they are not allowed to touch women, and he was uncomfortable sitting next to her.', 'She stated that she was then told to move due to this despite it being her set.', 'The airline later said that discrimination between passengers is strictly prohibited.'",
