        "postText": "\u2018My cousin will be so shocked when I tell him I\u2019m dating a black girl!\u2019 my ex said shortly after we started dating.', 'There I was, wondering whether I\u2019d accidentally taken up with a polyamorous hippy when I realised to my surprise, that he was actually talking about me.', 'Me \u2013 the most beige of people. The person with skin the colour of korma. As close to a Simpson as you could get.', 'I mean\u2026I am a bit black but that\u2019s not immediately obvious. It was a confusing moment.', 'Being ascribed an identity that doesn\u2019t belong to you is an odd experience. It makes you doubt how you act and whether you see yourself vastly differently to the way others see you.', 'And it\u2019s especially tricky when it comes to race.', 'It\u2019s not as if you\u2019re being insulted \u2013 it\u2019s not an insult to be called black (unless you\u2019re a member of the KKK). And there is some truth to it \u2013 you are partially black. But it\u2019s lazy and it suggests that that part of you overrides all else.', 'For me, it added an element of exoticism to the relationship.', 'I\u2019m sure he liked me for me, but it made me start to think whether I was fulfilling some kind of sexual quota \u2013 a liberal white dude experimenting with shades of black, starting with beige and working his way to burnt sienna.', 'Call me paranoid, but there we are.', 'And he\u2019s not been the last guy to describe me as being black.', 'On holiday a few months ago, I was having a heated discussion with a bloke from Hull who asked me if anyone could call him a racist when he was willing to have a drink with \u2018a black lass\u2019.', '\u2018When did you have a drink with a black lass?\u2019 I asked, baffled by the non-sequitur.', 'Yes, I was the \u2018black lass\u2019 that he was willing to have a drink with. Nothing shouts \u2018I\u2019M NOT A RACIST\u2019 like someone telling you they\u2019re ok with hanging out with you, while getting your race wrong.', 'It can feel sometimes that when people find out that you\u2019re partially black, it\u2019s like they give up on finding out anything else about you.', 'In my opinion, it\u2019s a particularly American problem which seems to have filtered across the pond.', 'The American slave trade was built upon shades of blackness.', 'There were Sambos (3/4 black), mulattos (half and half), quadroons (1/4 black), octoroons (1/8 black). All were black, all were enslaved. All that changed was where they worked on the plantations. The blacker you were, the more awful the job. The lighter you were, the more likely that you\u2019d be a nice lady\u2019s maid or butler.', 'Despite the US\u2019 love of racial ambiguity (Kim K and kids are basically America\u2019s first family), they\u2019ve still got a massive racial problem and alienation of minorities is endemic. Promoting otherness is their meat and drink.', 'In this country we\u2019ve had our racial problems but they\u2019ve never been anywhere near as extreme as America\u2019s.', 'And on the whole, our history of racial integration has been a lot cleaner.', 'In America, many slaves were raped or entered into relationships with owners, producing generations of brown people. Blackness had to be extended to accommodate for many different colours.', 'But here in the UK, the influx of immigrants has been more recent and more clear-cut \u2013 and as a result, our mixing and digesting of their identities has been more precise.', 'Mixed race children may have been called black back in the 50s and 60s but we\u2019re generally clearer about dual heritage because people have an easier time of telling where they\u2019re from. They can say that their grandfather was from West Africa or wherever.', 'To simply lump everyone together \u2013 including those who are of very light skin and who do not see themselves as \u2018black\u2019 \u2013 can be quite offensive.', '', 'It can throw all kinds of uncomfortable questions up about one\u2019s identity and relationship to it.', 'How can someone as light as me be assigned the same label as someone with an experience of blackness that I can never relate to?', 'In beauty, fashion, relationships, careers \u2013 everything \u2013 our experience of race plays a role.', 'Not only is using blackness as an umbrella confusing for those of who are not fully black, but it downplays the significance of that experience for those who own it.', 'Black people have enough to worry about without us beige folk trying to share the stage.",
