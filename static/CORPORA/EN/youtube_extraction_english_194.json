Their political, social and economic standing makes them the most powerful generation to have ever lived. David suggests that our attitude towards later life needs a reboot at every level and that we have locked ourselves into a culture that is anti-age.   David is the founder of the media and research company AGEIST, whose purpose is to reinvent how life after 50 is lived.. Learn more at http://tedxasburypark.com/. . . It is well-documented that people over 50 are living in radically different ways than their parents, and those who are 50+ are now a critically important demographic. Their political, social and economic standing makes them the most powerful generation to have ever lived. David is the founder of media and research company AGEIST, whose purpose is to reinvent how life after 50 is lived, experienced, and understood. He says this is best achieved through design and modern media tactics rather than legislation, and until this is embraced, we will fail to see the real economic, humanitarian, and cultural benefits of increasing longevity.  David suggests that our attitude towards later life needs a reboot at every level. He says that we've locked ourselves into a culture that is anti-age and it is evident throughout media, organizations, and even in the language we use.
