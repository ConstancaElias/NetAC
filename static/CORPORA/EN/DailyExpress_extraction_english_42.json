        "postText": "Rachel Riley, 31, is famous for her stunning looks and brainy maths skills on Channel 4\u2019s Countdown, but viewers are concerned that she could be set to lose her job after the recent confirmation that models will no longer play a part in Formula 1 or darts.', A statement released yesterday by managing director of commercial operations at Formula 1, Sean Bratches, said that the practice no longer felt \u201cappropriate or relevant\u201d to the sport.', '\u201cOver the last year we have looked at a number of areas which we felt needed updating so as to be more in tune with our vision for this great sport,\u201d he said.', '\u201cWhile the practice of employing grid girls has been a staple of Formula 1 Grand Prix\u2019s for decades, we feel this custom does not resonate with our brand values and clearly is at odds with modern day societal norms.\u201d', 'In response, Countdown fans have taken to social media concerned that the impact could affect Rachel\u2019s role in the show.', '\u201cThey\u2019ll make Rachel Riley redundant for looking hot in Countdown,\u201d one fumed, while another said: \u201cSo I suppose Rachel Riley will now be asked to \u2018dress down\u2019 on Countdown. Let\u2019s wait and see\u2026\u201d', '\u201cRachel Riley wears similar clothes on Countdown as the walk-on girls,\u201d a third commented. \u201cWhere do you draw the line?\u201d', 'A fourth irritated social media user appeared to feel that the overall position of attractive females in the public eye was under threat, saying: \u201cFeminists trying to remove all good looking women from public view.', '\u201cFirst the darts. Now the F1. No one forces these women. Who\u2019s next? @KateAbdo on #SkySportsNews? @RachelRileyRR on #Countdown?\u201d', '\u201cWill @RachelRileyRR be replaced or forced to wear overalls and a crash helmet?\u201d another quipped, while one Twitter user lamented: \u201cRachel Riley will be next #KickGlamourOut.\u201d', '\u201cNow let\u2019s get rid off models and god knows what else,\u201d another chipped in. \u201cThe world has gone crazy. Next it will be Rachel Riley in Countdown.\u201d', 'The decision to stop the employment of grid girls at races has caused controversy among motorsport fans.', 'The news comes after Belgian-Dutch racing driver Max Vetstappen and German racer Nico H\u00fclkenberg both defended the tradition.', '\u201cThe grid girls must stay,\u201d Max said, while Nico insisted: \u201cIt would be a pity if they took the eye-candy from the grid.', 'Earlier this week, the Professional Darts Corporation revealed that it had axes walk-on girls after a request from TV bosses.',  'Express.co.uk has contacted a representative for Rachel Riley and Channel 4 asking for comment.",

There are plenty of examples of models showing more than needed and were some designers who just used naked models so how it that any different than girls working for darts or formula 1?",
