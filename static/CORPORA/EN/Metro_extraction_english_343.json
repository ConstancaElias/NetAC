        "postText": "Boris Johnson refused to bow to pressure from the prime minister and the Conservative Party leadership to apologise for his \u2018offensive\u2019 comments about burkas.', 'Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson has caused outrage with a newspaper article comparing women in the face-covering veils to bank robbers, with Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis ordering him to apologise for the remarks.', 'But the standoff continued even after Theresa May added her voice to calls for him to apologise \u2013 although she swerved questions about whether his comments amounted to Islamophobia.', 'With no apology forthcoming, founder and president of the Conservative Muslim Forum Lord Sheikh told the BBC the party should take \u2018severe action\u2019 against Mr Johnson.', 'He said: \u2018Take the whip from him. Why not? He\u2019s not a super human being, he\u2019s a member of the party.', '\u2018The party chairman, the prime minister has the right to take the whip\u2026 that\u2019s the thing I\u2019d like to see.\u2019', 'While former Conservative parliamentary candidate Shazia Awan-Scully accused Mr Johnson of \u2018pandering to the extreme right\u2019, comparing his comments to Enoch Powell\u2019s divisive Rivers of Blood speech, and said he should be sacked.', '\u2018If you cast your mind back 50 years to when Enoch Powell gave his Rivers of Blood speech, he was sacked from the shadow cabinet immediately,\u2019 she told BBC Newsnight.', '\u2018He was ostracised from his party immediately. Boris Johnson can say anything and get away with it.', '\u2018These comments are Islamophobic. They are against Muslims and I would urge any Muslims to not vote for the Conservative party because of their stance towards our community.\u2019', 'But The Conservative Woman co-editor Laura Perrins, appearing alongside Ms Awan-Scully, claimed Mr Johnson\u2019s remarks were taken out of context.', 'She said: \u2018This idea the man should be run out of town is exactly the kind of authoritarian nonsense we must resist. It is not responsible.\u2019', 'Conservative peer Lady Warsi accused Mr Johnson of adopting the \u2018dog-whistle\u2019 tactics of former Donald Trump aide Steve Bannon in the hope of attracting support from right-wing Tories for an eventual leadership bid.', 'Before Mrs May\u2019s intervention, a source close to Mr Johnson made clear he was not retracting his comments.', '\u2018It is ridiculous that these views are being attacked \u2013 we must not fall into the trap of shutting down the debate on difficult issues,\u2019 said the source.', '\u2018We have to call it out. If we fail to speak up for liberal values then we are simply yielding ground to reactionaries and extremists.\u2019', 'Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips tweeted that Mr Johnson was \u2018just a racist\u2019 in response.', '\u2018Happy to arrange debate with BJ (Boris Johnson) about all the actions I\u2019ve taken to stand up for liberal values including challenging things considered to be culturally sensitive.', '\u2018I\u2019m not afraid to do that, I do it daily without being a racist.', '\u2018He\u2019s done nothing to help he\u2019s just a racist.\u2019",

The reality is, of course, that no God of any religion created us with clothes at all. They are a practical necessity made by humans and concepts of shame and offence caused by nudity are cultural evolutions borne out of practicality over time.E) Not all Muslim women observe their faith by wearing either Niqab, burka or hijab.

It\u2019s ridiculous, everyone here commenting on how they should be banned and that he should be allowed to say what he likes are idiots , can\u2019t have someone like that leading the country .  And in the grand scheme of things, the argument of terrorism has little weight considering that The government know who is a potential risk to the country , it\u2019s just that they choose not to act until it\u2019s too late . I\u2019m a Christian but I feel that he was wrong to say what he said .     I\u2019m 17 , but seems to me like maybe the older generations have not yet got over the fact this isn\u2019t ; and never will be, a \u201cpure white/British\u201d country anymore.   Shame ,  but it\u2019s okay because when you all go , at least the CHILDREN will grow up to be decent humans , who know how to treat others .",

Reality Corbyn supports anti Jewish fringe extremists  whereas Johnson doesnt feel a burka allows someone to integrate and causes concern to most of us, both of which are facts.  He doesn't wish to ban like a large part of europe has either.  I suppose Dr Taj Hargey, the imam for Oxford Islamic community should apologise for potential future allegations being made of Islamophobia too because he has stated there is 'no Koranic legitimacy' for the Burka and it is 'a nefarious component of a trendy gateway theology for religious extremism and militant islam'.  Reality Corbyn panders to Islam extremism as he did the Irish extremists.  Labour to a lesser extent pander to Islam as over 80% of Muslims vote for Labour (source Sky news).",

A lot of Muslims speak out against Christianity and Christians for example, or home grown Brits, but no one criticises them; in fact, Christians are murdered in some Islamic countries. It is a fact that Islam is barbaric in many ways and if some people want to criticise that then they should be able to with impunity. Seems there's one law for Muslims and one for everyone else. For those who haven't seen it, look on youtube for British Police Go To Hell video.",

But why is it WE in the West from all stripes, seem to be so offended by a very practical honest and truthful reality.  The women who cover themselves like this DO NOT BELONG IN OUR COUNTRY.  It aint rocket science..Go back to where your culture is happiest and leave us to move forward.  Democracy should have been smart enough to see this coming and made provisons prior to landing.  i.e. like NO FACE COVERINGS and if you emigrate to a Western land, then you really must integrate fully..and that would include clothing attirs suitable for modesty without hiding who you actually are.",
