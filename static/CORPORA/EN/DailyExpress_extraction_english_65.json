        "postText": "'Ms Swinson used her campaign speech to call once more for the revocation of Article 50 and for Brexit to be cancelled. She also took at a swipe at her political rivals ahead of the December 12 ballot. The ardent Remainer took the opportunity to berate not only Boris Johnson but also Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Addressing supporters, she said: And Jeremy Corbyn, where do we start ? ', 'Jeremy Corbyn will not give you a straight answer on the biggest issue facing this country.', 'It is clear a vote for Labour is a vote for Brexit.', 'Every single time Jeremy Corbyn refuses to say whether he would back Remain or Leave it is clear that Remainers cannot trust Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Ms Swinson also claimed staying in the EU would produce a\u00a3 50 billion Remain bonus that could be spent on public services.', 'She said: Any type of Brexit will damage our economy, will cost jobs and starve our public services of the resources that they need.', 'So we know that that Remain bonus will be\u00a3 50 billion that we can spend on our public services, investing in our schools and in the welfare system to help the poorest in our society.', 'So every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Brexit and invest that \u00a350 billion in our public services.', 'Speaking in Westminster, Ms Swinson, who courted controversy on Monday for suggesting those refusing to debate her in TV leadership hustings are sexist, said the election could be a moment of seismic change where a new and different politics could emerge.', 'She told the audience: Change is possible and you get to choose.', 'Ms Swinson latest intervention comes after she was grilled over her accusations of sexism after she was denied a slot on the ITV leadership debates against Tory leader Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.', 'Ms Swinson believes the live TV debate is an\u201c establishment stitch - up\u201d made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.', 'But Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman said it  would take a miracle for the Remain MP to walk into Downing Street on December 12. ', 'She said: You\u2019ve said this is sexist.Isn\u2019t it the reality that it\u2019 s not sexism, it\u2019s realism that the two main credible candidates for Prime Minister are the ones who should get the scrutiny in a head - to - head debate ?', Shortly after Ms Swinson had finished her speech the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg grilled the Lib Dem leader on her bid to thwart the will of 17.4 million people.', 'Ms Kuenssberg asked: You said this morning you want to bring the country together. But how would you do that if your plan is to disregard the vote of millions of people in the referendum of 2016?', 'Whether that\u2019s campaigning to stop Brexit in another referendum or if you achieve your dream of a majority, revoking it all together without even having another vote?', 'The Lib Dem leader replied: As Liberal Democrats, we are standing up for what we believe in and we are very honest and straightforward about that. I recognise that there are differences of opinion on this issue and I think people recognise and appreciate that we are consistent and we are firm in what we are standing for.', 'I think it\u2019s also true that there is very little reason to have confidence that there is a majority in this country for any specific Brexit path.'",

Firstly this is predicated over a 10 year period and second and more importantly does not take into account the way the EU calculates the fee you pay. In 2021 I believe the Lisbon treaty takes effect and that will mean within a year or so our rebate will be removed and our yearly payment based on her premise that we will be better off will go up. So loss of rebate around \u00a34 billion and an increase in payment will take that \u00a35 billion yearly windfall we will supposedly gain, and have to give it back to the EU Her logic is cockeyed, not having to pay in \u00a312 / 14 billion a year is a gain to us and no one has attempted to calculate the increase in GDP we will gain from doing business round the world without the EU strangling it.The EU is a protectionist empire in the making, and will collapse soon due to the level of debt that is being created by QE. Our only hope is to be independent from the EU, so when the credit crunch comes around as it will, we will be able to do things ourselves that will help us to over come that scenario.No chance of that if we remain in the EU ",
