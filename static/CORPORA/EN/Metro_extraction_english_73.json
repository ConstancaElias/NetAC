        "postText": "A new seafood restaurant has tweaked its dress code after people branded it as a way of deterring black people from visiting.', 'Among the list of \u2018strictly prohibited\u2019 items at The Choptank included excessively baggy clothing, backwards hats, athletic attire and beanie hats.', 'The restaurant has since made minor changes to the rules after people branded them as \u2018racist\u2019, but they insist other places in the neighbourhood have similar rules.', 'Also on the list of banned clothing were trousers worn below the waist, shorts below the knee, work and construction boots and back packs.', 'The Choptank found itself in a social media storm when journalist and author R. Eric Thomas tweeted a picture of the dress code sign.', 'He asked management to explain its \u2018blatantly discriminatory\u2019 dress code and was instead blocked by the restaurant in Baltimore, Maryland, US.', 'Thomas said the restaurant later unblocked him but didn\u2019t answer his question about their clothing rules.', 'A picture of the sign was originally shared on Sunday by photographer J.M Giordano, who said: \u2018Dress CODED sign at the new Choptank restaurant in Fells.\u2019', 'Responding to his tweet, The Choptank said they only implemented the same dress code standard used by several other restaurants in the area.', 'People were quick to hit back, accusing the restaurant as a thinly veiled attempt to keep black people out.', 'One person tweeted: \u2018Everyone else\u2019s dress code is extremely racist so ours is as well\u2019 is not a great answer.\u2019', 'Another said: \u2018If you were just trying to follow neighborhood standards, why block people asking?', '\u2018Maybe acting in a way that looks like you\u2019ve got other motives, intentions, and cares isn\u2019t the best bet.\u2019', 'Another said the note saying \u2018rules enforced at the management\u2019s discretion\u2019 was another way of saying \u2018of course we don\u2019t care what white people do\u2019.', 'But others defended the restaurant\u2019s right to have a dress code and said they\u2019ve seen plenty of white people wearing baggy clothing, bandannas and beanies.', 'They questioned why people would automatically associate the types of clothing described with ethnic minorities.', 'The Choptank has since made some minor changes to its policy \u2013 allowing athletic wear until 10pm and changing \u2018excessively baggy clothing\u2019 to \u2018pants must be worn at the waist\u2019.', 'It also added religious exemptions to brimless headgear, changed \u2018strictly prohibited\u2019 to \u2018house rules\u2019 and removed the part about enforcement at the manager\u2019s discretion.', 'They were grilled over a previous twitter post showing band members wearing backward hats performing for their opening weekend.', 'Management were also criticised for sharing a photo of their patio, featuring a gaming area including pool, ping pong and table football.', 'People questioned how they could play sports if they had to wear a \u2018tight fitting tux just to get in\u2019.', 'I dress like a my Mom taught me so  my clothes will be just fine as will my forward facing Trump2020 hat.', '\u2014 Ron Folds (@FoldsRon) September 19, 2019', 'In a statement Atlas Restaurant Group, which owns The Choptank, said many other places in Baltimore have stricter dress codes.', 'It added: \u2018In fact, Disney has its own dress code, as does M&T Bank Stadium and the Baltimore City School System.', '\u2018This is important to the environment and experience that each institution is trying to create, whether a learning or dining environment.\u2019', 'The company said it employs more than 1,000 people, two-thirds of whom are ethnic minorities, and described itself as \u2018one of the largest minority employers in Baltimore\u2019.', 'It added: \u2018Furthermore we spend half a million dollars on local entertainment, the majority of which are minorities.', '\u2018We have one of the most diverse and inclusive customer bases in Baltimore. Diversity and inclusion is incredibly important to our company.', '\u2018At a time when Baltimore needs as many reasons to cheer as possible, it is unfortunate a brand new, beautifully restored landmark in the Fells Point neighbourhood, which has created more than 100 badly-needed jobs for the community is under scrutiny.\u2019",
