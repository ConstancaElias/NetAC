        "postText": "A toddler was subjected to a horrendous race hate attack by a total stranger as he sat in his buggy with his mum.', 'Mum Lisa was pushing 18-month-old Ryan down the street at around midday on June 25 when a woman walked up to her, leaned into her baby\u2019s pram and screamed \u2018n****r\u2019.', 'Lisa \u2013 who has chosen not to give her second name \u2013 said she was horrified and has spoken out after five of her six mixed race children have now experienced racism.', 'She told BBC Radio Ulster\u2019s Talkback programme the attack was not only a hate crime, but also called it \u2018child abuse\u2019.', 'Lisa, from Ballymurphy, west Belfast, described how she had been shopping at Sainsbury\u2019s on Falls Road with her son before the attack happened.', '\u2018It has just been shocking. I thought she was a passer-by and she screamed all over the road the n-word,\u2019 Lisa said.', '\u2018I said to her \u201cexcuse me?\u201d she continued to walk on and I was expecting a confrontation.', '\u2018She was about 45-50 and not a care in the world she just walked on, it was horrible.', '\u2018I put the break on the pram and followed her up the road a bit but returned to the child, I wanted to challenge her.\u2019', 'She added: \u2018It\u2019s a hate crime. I\u2019m in a mixed race marriage. We have six children and five of them have experienced racism at different levels.\u2019', 'Lisa shared her message to urge other victims of hate crimes to speak out and for wider society to challenge it.', '\u2018What I\u2019m afraid of is people become victims and it becomes normal and they become numb to the fact, it isn\u2019t acceptable,\u2019 Lisa said.', '\u2018It\u2019s amoral and it\u2019s a criminal offence. It\u2019s child abuse.\u2019', 'She revealed that the family had previously been forced to leave their home due to racist abuse.', 'Writer Tim Brannigan drew attention to the attack on Twitter and told Metro.co.uk the response has been \u2018phenomenal\u2019.', '\u2018The large majority are people who have been appalled,\u2019 he said.', 'The incident is currently being investigated by the Police Service Northern Ireland and is being treated as a hate crime.', 'Police said the attack was carried out by a woman in her late forties/early fifties, who was 5ft7 with auburn shoulder length hair.', 'She was wearing a long skirt or maxi dress which was blue/purple in colour.', 'Anyone with any information about the incident is asked to contact the PSNI on 101, quoting the serial number 984 with the date 26/06/2018.",

            "commentText": "Racism is a two way thing, some <b> black </b>people will never like white people (i've witnessed their name calling too), and some white people will never like<b>  black</b> people. However, there is now way police can deal with it every time someone calls someone a name. With all the serious crime going on i.e. killings, rapes, paedophiles etc i'd rather police time was spent investigating that. It was very unacceptable to shout at a baby (or anyone), it's a shame she didn't take a photo of th<b> e woma</b>n to shame her.",
