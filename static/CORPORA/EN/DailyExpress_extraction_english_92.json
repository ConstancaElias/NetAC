It is disgusting that you use suffragettes and what they fought for against the voice of the same people today. May i advise you to listen to the people instead of turning of their voice.",

Clearly with \"hate speech\" laws on the British books this is no longer a free society and so pressure will build inexorably until those who imposed this evil on us are swept away in the tidal wave of indignation as the controls become ever more petty.",
