        "postText": "A shopkeeper in Derbyshire has refused to stop selling Golliwogs because \u2018there is nothing racist about them\u2019.', 'Matlock Bath General Store in Matlock Bath has come under criticism for selling the dolls, which are now widely regarded as racist caricatures.', 'Many stores such as Hamleys in London no longer stock the toys, while even their own creator described them as \u2018a horrid sight, the blackest gnome\u2019.', 'But the manager of the general store in Matlock, who did not give his name to Metro.co.uk, blasted critics of the dolls and was adamant that he was doing \u2018nothing wrong.\u2019', 'Defending his decision to sell them he said: \u2018There is nothing racist about them. They are very popular.', '\u2018I sell them to all minorities. I\u2019m doing nothing wrong.\u2019', 'He argued there was nothing wrong in what he was doing because he gets he gets the Golliwogs from suppliers \u2018all over the shop, from all over the country\u2019.', 'But one source, who did not want to be named, was shocked to see a number of the different dolls on sale, saying it was like the shop was \u2018caught in a time warp\u2019.', 'The 30-year-old, from London, told Metro.co.uk: \u2018It was a general store and had a shelf of golliwogs of different sizes for sale, which was quite a shock to see.\u2019', '\u2018It isn\u2019t something you expect to see in this day and age.\u2019', 'Golliwogs \u2013 black-skinned dolls with exaggerated red lips and frizzy hair designed to look like minstrels \u2013 are based on a character created by Florence Kate Upton in the 19th century.', 'Upton\u2019s character was, in turn, based on a blackface minstrel \u2013 a white person who painted their face black, had exaggerated frizzy hair, and wore bright pink lipstick in a racist caricature of black people.', 'Earlier this year Andy Wilkinson, owner of shop the Upstairs Downstairs in Kent vowed to continue selling them despite complaints from neighbours who called his store \u2018an embarrassment to the town.\u2019', 'While in February senior Labour councillor Lynn Sterry came under fire for supporting a campaign to \u2018Bring Back the Golliwog,\u2019 arguing the offensive dolls reminded her of a childhood toy.",

I have 2 friends who come from Barbados and still live there named Pitt, I have another West<b>  Indian</b> friend of over 40 years who lives and works in West London name Whitney Blackwood who works as a housing officer. He too does not use FB. His mother still lives in Harold Hill in Essex she doesn't even own a computer. I have a great aunt who lives in Australia she doesn't use FB either.Very few of my white English friends use FB either and if you'd really checked my FB friends you'd have seen that 99% of them are relatives and not all of them by any means and of the others, some have died, or are friends from my tee<b> n ag</b>e years.Amyr Minhas is a ve<b> ry o</b>ld dear friend of mine from my college days who lives in Liverpool &amp; works as a Parole Officer, he too doesn't use FB, but did use Friends United. I could go on, but you get my point.Oh! nearly forgot my mum was married to a W<b> est Ind</b>ian called Ken Hogan. He stabbed her. He didn't kill her and she divorced him, but you can see why he's not on my FB friends list either.My FB friend list only covers about 10% of my real life friends and family. I checked your FB list!!!!!!! not too many there.If you manage to read this far in my reply then Peace and understanding that not all things are what they aqt first appear to be.:-)",

Also while you're at it please look up the definition of context and intent. Calling someone a golliwog doesn't make it a slur, if you are doing so to cause offence then you are at fault (not the word) because in that context you are purposely using it with the intent to be derogatory towards someone based on their<b>  ethnic</b> background. Out of that context it's literally the name of a bloody children's toy. It's no<b> t racis</b>t, it's not teaching people that a particul<b> ar ra</b>ce is inferior to others, it's a doll. Move on with your l<b> ife snowfl</b>ake.",
