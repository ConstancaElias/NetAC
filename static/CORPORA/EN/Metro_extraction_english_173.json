        "postText": "A British woman has said she was racially profiled, misgendered and asked if she could \u2018even speak English\u2019 while shopping in a London cosmetics store.', 'MonBelle, 33, claims she was closely tailed by a shop assistant the moment she entered East End Cosmetics to buy hair moisturiser on August 6.', 'The business owner, who has lived in Dubai for over 10 years, then attempted to purchase her items with a United Arab Emirates debit card.', 'But as she tried to pay, she said the cashier became increasingly aerated because the card was rejected and denied it had worked when it finally went through.', 'MonBelle claims the woman then demanded to see her ID, which was back at her hotel, before asking her where she was from.', 'She told Metro.co.uk: \u2018I\u2019ve travelled all over the world with my card and I have never ever had a problem.', '\u2018My bank is connected to my phone and I immediately got a text that showed \u00a312 had gone to their shop. I tried to show the woman but she wouldn\u2019t believe me.', '\u2018She took my card off me and kept asking whose it was, asking me if it was stolen and telling a male worker to block the door because she was calling the police. It was ridiculous.', '\u2018That\u2019s when she turned to me and was like: \u201cDo you even understand English? Where are you from?\u201d.', '\u2018I\u2019m thinking: \u201cWoah. Okay. This is a different vibe, this is not right\u201d. She\u2019s telling me I\u2019m foreign, that I shouldn\u2019t even be here, all while using male pronouns.', '\u2018It\u2019s weird because she was Asian herself, which is completely not an issue, but for her to tell me I don\u2019t understand English, in broken English, was bizarre.', '\u2018I eventually snatched my card out of her hand and left the store. To be honest, I felt a bit traumatised by the whole thing.', '\u2018I\u2019ve never had this before, anywhere, and I least of all expected it from the place where I am from.\u2019', 'MonBelle, who was born in Bradford, was excited to be back in the UK and visiting friends and family who live around London.', 'But the CEO, who owns Dubai events and entertainment company Those Guys, said the \u2018offensive\u2019 nature of the incident in store reduced her to tears.', 'A member of staff also prevented her from taking the items she\u2019d bought, meaning she left the shop empty handed.', 'MonBelle said: \u2018When you\u2019re black and someone is threatening to call the police, even if you know it\u2019s such an insignificant thing\u2026 [You might think], \u201cAre you joking? Sure, let them come. I\u2019ll talk to them.\u201d', '\u2018But there\u2019s still a part of you thinking: \u201cWhat if the police come and I have to go through the same battle with them. What if the wrong police officer comes and it\u2019s another whole story\u201d.', '\u2018It made me feel a bit worthless, like degraded. Nobody, regardless of where they\u2019re from or what their orientation is, no one should feel like that.', '\u2018Disappointing is not even if the word. It\u2019s disgusting behaviour.\u2019', 'When approached for comment, Shabir Bhanji, owner of East End Cosmetics, denied MonBelle\u2019s transaction had gone through \u2013 but said she could call her bank for the money if this was not the case.', 'He told Metro.co.uk the cashier had been following till instructions to withhold the card and claimed MonBelle had become \u2018offensive and aggressive\u2019 as a result.', 'Mr Bhanji said: \u2018There are so many scams going on, there so many cards that are stolen and being used in the city.', '\u2018We\u2019re doing a job that is not our job. It would have been easier to just give the card back, even if the till tells you to keep it.\u2019', 'He continued: \u2018We treat all the customers very fairly, although a lot of my staff get a lot of abuse. Retail is very tough. I was told this customer wasn\u2019t pleasant at all.', '\u2018I have rules in place I make my staff follow. Don\u2019t retaliate and don\u2019t become aggressive back. If you feel threatened, call the police.', '\u2018Why would my staff, knowing how strict I am on customer service, be rude to a customer?\u2019', 'Mr Bhanji said he would not apologise to MonBelle and also denied accusations that she had been racially profiled while in the shop.', 'He said: \u2018When somebody says to me you\u2019re racist, I say listen, I\u2019m from Africa.', '\u2018Racism is not within my company philosophy. We are all migrants ourselves. I employ people in the company of all ethnicities.\u2019",

Even in anger it still means 'do you understand moron', its an insult in that context but its stil<b> l nothin</b>g to do with raceMost of what was said is wrong but dont turn it into<b>  a ra</b>ce matter when it isnt, you harm others by doing that. Its a dispute not a hate crime, one that I think you should pursue but dont play <b> the r</b>ace card unless its a<b> bout </b>race!!!!",

Don't be attacking me , just read the thread of comments yourselves and even if any white males feel I've stepped out of line by stating what I observed from their comments and decides to start bashing me, I hopefully will not read it b'cos it was just a coincidence I read this. article. An Asian person can discriminate against a<b>  Black</b> person, considering India/ Asian<b> s natio</b>n have a longstanding historical system of discrimination (disregard, humiliation against e.t.c) against dark-skinned people (colorism caste system).  the fairer your skin, the more privilege &amp; respect &amp; pure, unpolluted touchable you're.  If  darkers skinned (aka untouchables) in India Asians communities experience colourism, how much more that expressed again<b> st Bla</b>ck people who are non Asian/Indian people.",
