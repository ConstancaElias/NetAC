The food was awesome, the places we stayed were amazing, the culture was beautiful and colourful. We sailed up the Yangzee River, and walked along the great wall, and you know what it was great. So yes if you are giving away free tickets can i request 4 please but this time It would be nice to travel either fisrt class or business class, that little extra leg room on the plane makes a big difference!",

Countries that invest heavily in education and research and development create more. There is no <b> ethnic </b>factor in that. Just money. That is why you now see continents like Aisa and starting to catch up, and India is beginning to invest in R&amp;D more too. If you think about it, to find those rare minds that can reinvent the wheel, you have to educate everyone and look for those with exceptional abilities. The middle east was doing that before Europe was (hence their advances in science and maths) until Catholics took it upon themselves to disrupt it with crusades. Free thinking education and investment is the key here. Where you have that, you have innovation.",

            "commentText": "Except that isn't really true. \"White men\" did not create our world. Humans first evolved in east africa about 2.5 million years ago. Some of our greatest achievements and philosophical thoughts derived from the greeks and the romans. Incas, aztecs, egyptians and the chinese all were evolved civilizations long before Britain.If his issue is with immigrants well we are descendants of many different \"races\" thanks to the significant number of invasions that have happened during the existence of our little island. 55 and 54 BC caesar invaded and the romans invaded again in 43 AD. Vikings invaded many times between the 8th and 11th century. The norman invasion in 1066. In fact there have been so many it is hard to keep track. Even our language is evidence of invasions by immigrants as we have a west germanic language with influences of latin. So when we were invaded their language became ours and the language that we claim we created is technically a combination of early german and italian (in the crudest explanation possible). So our \"white british heritage\" is actually nordic, german, italian, greek and <b> african.</b> And, whilst I appreciate that is a gross simplification of the last few million years, I sort of felt anything more intellectual would be too hard for that bigot to understand. Oh! And his little bit about letting women run the world. Let us not forget that the two longest reigning monarchs of this country are women. And why shouldn't women have positions of power? Some of the greatest moments in history are thanks to the triumphs of women. Amelia Earhart was the first<b>  woman</b> to fly solo across the atlantic and did it faster than the first man who did it three years before (averaging out the miles traveled within each hour). Marie Curie won two nobel prizes. Elizabeth 1st was one of the most feared people on the english throne. If you ask me, women are pretty amazing.",
