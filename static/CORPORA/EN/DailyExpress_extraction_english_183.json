        "postText": "'The pro-European party\u2019s first female leader, who took over from Sir Vince Cable this year, had hit out at ITV for excluding her from their debate. Sky News has proposed the debate for Thursday November 28. The network had originally planned to include only the prime minister and Mr Corbyn.', 'Announcing the line-up on their website, Sky noticeably left out Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage.', 'The Lib Dems have threatened to take legal action against ITV if Ms Swinson is not allowed to appear on their general election leaders\u2019 televised debate, scheduled for November 19.', 'Ms Swinson has said if she is not on the stage, the Remain vote would not be represented.', 'She also pointed out that there would be no woman present to tackle the prime minister and the leader of the opposition.', 'Responding to Sky 's invitation, Ms Swinson took to Twitter to publicly challenge both Mr Johnson and the Labour leader to face her on live TV.', 'She said: I'm in. Will you show up @BorisJohnson and @jeremycorbyn? #DebateHer.', 'Earlier, a clearly frustrated Ms Swinson said if Mr Johnson and Mr Coryn shied away from debating her it suggested that they are sexist or they are scared or possibly both.', ' She also accused the two men of being part of an establishment stitch - up. ', ' In a passionate speech outside Parliament, flanked by female Lib Dem MPs, Ms Swinson said it was nonsense to push aside the Remain voice. ', ' She told reporters: The TV debates about who will be the next prime minister of our country cannot and should not exclude the only woman leader who is able to be the next prime minister.', 'I stand as a candidate to be prime minister and as the leader of the biggest and strongest party of Remain. ', ' It is a nonsense to suggest that this should go ahead as Leave versus Leave, with no voice for Remain whatsoever.The voice of the millions of people who voted to Remain, who want to stop Brexit and stay in the European Union, must be heard in those leaders\u2019 debates.', 'As Liberal Democrats,we will take any action required to make sure that that voice of Remain is represented in those debates.', 'A spokeswoman for the party said a legal team has been instructed to be prepared to launch legal action if ITV does not change its decision quickly.', 'Ms Swinson said she is delighted to lead a party which is made up of 50 / 50 men and women MPs.', 'She said it is so important that in 2019 Parliament and politics properly represents the country that we are here to serve.', 'She recalled a previous televised debate which featured the leaders of the Lib Dems, Labour and Conservatives.', 'Ms Swinson said her party have had meetings with ITV, adding: We will be following up with letters and legal action, and we will of course keep you informed about those steps as those actions progress.', 'ITV has said it was already organising a separate live debate which will feature seven party leaders and added that Ms Swinson, among other leaders, had been invited to take pat in a live interview programme on the same night of the Johnson-Corbyn debate.', 'An ITV spokesman said at the weekend: ITV intends to offer viewers comprehensive and fairly - balanced general election coverage.', 'This involves a wide range of programming, including a live debate programme in which seven party leaders are invited to take part, as well as a live debate between the Labour and Conservative leaders.'",
