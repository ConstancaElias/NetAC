        "postText": "'Haringey Borough's FA Cup fourth qualifying round clash with Yeovil was abandoned after the home side's goalkeeper was allegedly racially abused.', 'Yeovil fans reportedly threw an object at home goalkeeper Valery Douglas Pajetat as Rhys Murphy lined up to take a penalty in the 64th minute.', 'Although Murphy scored to make the score 1-0 to Haringey, the hosts soon walked off the pitch at Coles Park Stadium.', 'It soon emerged that Pajetat was apparently subjected to racist abuse and even spat at by away supporters, with the keeper's team-mate Coby Rowe among those furious during the incident.', 'Rowe had to be restrained by security while both sets of players opted to leave the pitch in solidarity.', 'If we get punished and thrown out, I don't care, he later told BBC Radio 5 Live.', 'Yeovil captain Carl Dickinson approached the Yeovil fans with the referee also speaking to the contingent of travelling fans.', 'The match - contested for a place in the FA Cup first round proper - was paused for over 20 minutes as fans remained inside the stadium and players sat in the dressing room.', 'But it was then decided that the match would be officially abandoned, with both teams returning to the pitch afterwards.', 'Haringey Borough said on Twitter:  Sorry for the late update but wanted to make sure we gave correct information.', 'Game has been abandoned following racial abuse. Horrendous afternoon. It must be said that 99.9% of @YTFC fans are also disgusted by what's happened as much as we are.', ' One club, one community.', 'Football's anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out declared in a statement: These reports of alleged racist abuse aimed at goalkeeper Valery Douglas Pajetat yet again means players are continuing to receive discriminatory abuse while doing their job.', 'The Haringey manager and players took swift and decisive action as a result of the abuse, similar to that taken by the England team out in Bulgaria.', 'Kick It Out has informed The FA and will support the club in identifying the offender(s) to ensure appropriate action is taken and strong punishment issued. ', 'We would also like to offer our full support to Douglas and all at Haringey Borough FC. ', 'In a statement, the FA said: We are deeply concerned about the allegation of discrimination from an area of the crowd towards a player during the FA Cup fourth round qualifying match between Haringey Borough and Yeovil Town, which resulted in the fixture being abandoned. ', 'There is no room for discrimination in our game and we are working with the match officials and the relevant authorities, as a matter of urgency, to fully establish the facts and take the appropriate steps.', 'The Metropolitan Police have launched investigation into the matter. ', 'MPS Haringey said on Twitter: Police are investigating reports of racist comments made during a match between Haringey Borough FC and Yeovil Town on Saturday, 19 October. Officers are also investigating after items were reportedly thrown onto the playing area. No arrests; enquiries continue.  ', 'The incident comes after members of the England national team suffered racist abuse during their Euro 2020 qualifier with Bulgaria.'",
