I understand the intent behind it though.  There are plenty of festering sh!tholes out there with sharia law where, in theory, muslims could be perfectly comfortable in the absence of any non-muslims who might threaten them with awkward questions or basic hygiene.  They certainly didn't need to bring that sh!t here, to a country that is comparatively recently recovered from hundreds of years of idiotic christian shenanigans... let alone go around acting like criticism of their medieval ways equates to<b>  racism</b>.And to think a few decades ago it almost seemed like Britain might finally be free from religious superstition and the repugnant cultural baggage that goes along with it.  Back to the drawing board.",

You deliberately take the difference of view as <b> racism </b>or \u201cislamophobia\u201d yet you show yourself to be the odd combination of a bully and a victim. You have to decide what sort of world you want. One where people can have differing view or one where everyone has to have the same opinions. We seem to have successfully done away with heresy laws but now we have new ones. Criticism of any characteristics of Islam or progressive values has become blasphemy.",
