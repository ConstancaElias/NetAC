Three-fourths of older workers blame age discrimination for their lack of confidence in finding a new job. So we set up a fake business, giving out free gift baskets, to shine a spotlight on the barriers and ageist assumptions that older workers face in the job search.

All of the business risk is shifted to the drivers.   \n\nHow does it feel that every worker has been turned into a commodity?  We are no more than cogs in a machine.  \n\nThe reason I referenced some greats in civilization is simple.  People don’t get worse with age they get better.",

I almost cried every day while driving to work but stuck it out for 5 months without calling off until I found a job I love. I was blessed that my new boss actually preferred older workers because they are reliable, less likely to play on their phones while working, more accepting of constructive criticism, don't usually collapse under pressure and would never even consider asking for a mental health day! Older workers know how to work hard, don't need constant affirmation and have enough life & work experience to handle most unusual situations.",

I was let go, not because \"I was a bad RN, I just didn't fit their company\" haha, because I showed up for my work and did my job. I think one of the young RN supervisors couldn't handle my work ethic, don't like someone that makes them look bad. I had another job by end of week. 😂",

The sad truth is, no one under 20..or 30..or 40 (pick your favorite number, doesnt matter) wants to have anything to do with anyone outside of their immediate peer circle. They feel they dont have anything in commmon; they dont fit in, they dont belong.\nBut the reality is, thats not how society works. When you go out into the world, you will find that a community is made up of all different kinds of people, from various backgrounds, ages, races, etc.\nIf we are to survive in this life, we all need to learn to work together and help one another. If we approached civilization as we did personal relationships, society would be strictly segregated into countless groups, each with a common thread and strong divisions keeping us apart.

If the previous generations dont set the younger up for success, it is the failure of the older, and all generations suffer. \n\nThe older generations have continually driven civilization into the ground. Who is more to blame, the generation that failed to build a system that lasts and failed to mentor their own youth, or the generation that recognizes that the system is a failed one? \n\nYounger generations should prepare for the collapse and rebirth of civilization rather than keep failing as our forefathers and mothers have. Good luck all. Maybe think of how to not support the system of exploitation and debt slavery anymore. Maybe quit the identity politics of the globalists, that our forebarers created and realize we're all in the shit together.",

It's awful and some of the residents that had been there were leaving before I left but I really  loved them and they loved me! I took care of them like they were my grandmas and grandpa's!  I actually knew a handful of them from church and from when I was in middle/ Jr. High school and  Elementary School.  So they were very close to my heart and the bosses seem to only care about their paychecks and getting home to their parties or get togethers!   Once years before we had two bosses that were at the same place but they left because of how they were being treated. Those bosses we had were caring and cared about the nurses and CNA's and they would come in, in the middle of the night to help do the CNA work  or nurses jobs but the new bosses would not even answer their phone's!  I should have reported them but  everyone knows everyone in town so I didn't want to go down that road. One of my friends that's an RN  had a job for me but I broke my left foot in two places and it took a long time to heal and I'm still limping to this day. I love people but dislike drama from any age person like I was dealing with!  Yes I'm trying to do my own P.T. by myself  to strengthen my foot! I'm telling everyone if you know you've broken any bones in your foot then get to the doctor or hospital right away don't listen to anyone. I had to go 7 weeks with the broken bones and no one was listening to me till I got ex-rays on my foot.  Going to a podiatrist is much cheaper than a hospital and they can tell you what you need.   Thank you for caring.",

I don't like saying anything bad about a place but they were going down hill but after I left I kept seeing notifications that they were hiring all the time like they couldn't keep cna's.  It's  just to bad because  my mom's friends and  my friends that all work either in the hospital or doctor offices and so people  I don't know all said that the assistant living company's I are all going down hill.

        "commentText": "@Jennifer Vieira you'll find a way. May I make a suggestion that might seem strange? Give it to God, put your trust in Him and He will provide. I was the head chef and kitchen manager in a job at an independent living facility and I adored my job. My company lost the contract and I was asked to stay by the facility but the way they took the contract away was sneaky, underhanded and just downright mean to my bosses. I declined because my bosses had become my friends and you don't stab your friends in the back. Was unemployed for 7 months. Didn't understand why because I have the skills, I rarely call off, my bosses gave me great references and I have a lot of experience. Realized it was my age, I'm over 60. I ran out of unemployment and used up my tiny savings. While driving home from my sister's one day I was praying for help and began to cry. I thought, I've done all I can. Put in applications almost daily for the past month, updated my resume and sent a customized cover letter with every application. There's nothing else I can do so it's in God's Hands. Then I prayed again, giving it to God, putting my trust in Him. Felt better and actually stopped worrying knowing the Lord had my back. Within 2 days I had 3 job offers! Ended up taking a nursing home job and when a new company took over and cut my hours, I went to another nursing home and it was the job from Hell. Used to ask God why He sent me to 2 places that didn't work out, but I persevered. Stuck it out for five months then finally found my dream job working for a charity feeding the elderly poor. They hired me because I had nursing home experience! God knew what He was doing! It all started when I put all of my trust in Him. Every time I'd start to worry I'd tell myself, God's got this and my fear and worry would slowly vanish. I'll keep praying for you! There's a line from a song on KLove, \"Trust in the Lord and never give up hope, you're gonna do great things I already know. God's got His Hand on so don't live your life in fear, forgive and forget but don't forget why you're here.",

She need's her hair done & need's some glasses that aren't the type generally given to institutionalized people/Prison & Psych patients. Also, a good attitude might help instead of complaining...she might ask what she might do to get a more positive response. I had an employer once that treated their people like family. They might ask to use your car to go to lunch or go look at a new car for them...so they knew how the people who worked for them would be treated. The vehicle at the very least would come back with an oil change and a full tank of gas or maybe new tires. No, I'm not joking. I once was called into the office and the owners were there with arm's crossed & said that they had been watching me...OK, I'm in the office...!! They said that they still couldn't figure out how I was able to tell someone where to go with such elegance and have them smile and agree with me while I was doing it. Had many other wonderful experiences and Never got fired or laid off from a job in my lifetime",

I have been offered jobs at jobs I've been working at.. I'd be given a business card and be offered new employment. Another situation is when I was at a small local store years ago and & couple came in from the lake. The man in swimming trunks and I think her in a swim suit & cover up, I don't know if they had shoe's on or not, but it's where people live on the water. The cashier got snotty with them and I was behind them. The cashier was telling me that she had a job interview the next day and she would be so happy that she wouldn't have to work there anymore. The couple she was so rude to paid for their things. The man looked at the cashier and told her that he was the owner of the company she was supposed to have the interview with & she just failed/she didn't need to go because she failed!!! That's the point.",

The young are more likely to spend less wisely, and therefore have more available disposable income. This trickles down to a general distorted perception in society. This btw is unique to western culture, where newer is always perceived as better. This idea has lead us to become a more and more vacuous society. Most now value characters, as opposed to having character. The Kardashians being famous for no reason is a prime symptom.",
