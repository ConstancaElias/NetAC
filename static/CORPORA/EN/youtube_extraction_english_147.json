That's called a double standard. Basically, it is only a problem if it effects you, right? Yes, you can be assumed incompetent if you are young, which is wrong, but that is <b> nothing </b>compared to how we marginalize older people. Getting older is almost always seen as undesirable in our culture, while being and looking young forever is the eternally illusive (and pathetic) goal for many. Young people trying to make<b>  ageism</b> all about them is asinine and completely self-centered.",
