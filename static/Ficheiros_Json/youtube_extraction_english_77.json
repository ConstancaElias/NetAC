        "commentText": "Leigh G like I said age got its rights just like time it's coming and going whether you like it or NOT'👊 plastic surgeries how many for how long?!?!!! We is humans wait !!!🤣🤣 grow up and change and behave our age all I'm saying is life would be easier for her if she accepts the fact that that we at Alder ain't no need to cry and get more plastic surgeries as you get older ' especially in your mid-50s . What else do you want live your life be happy and enjoy every moment smile when you see another year be happy you're alive you're around your family friends or whatever you like doing not living 50% of my life I dedicated to plastic surgeries and try to stay looking young 4 ever YAHH. She probably be judging da fuck out of young women. Someone like her the biggest fear she got besides getting older or having a gray hair is for some young kid saying that old lady over there I guarantee you that would break her heart that probably would be the straw that broke the camel's back. Especially if they're at the restaurant and the waiter says yeah them older couple there are next she wants to stay looking young but it's not going to work even if you have a billion dollars and why is she trying so hard she wants to impress people she don't want to look old is her friends I'm the youngest looking one out of all my friends people think I'm like in my late 20s or maybe like 33 because all my other friends don't take care of yourself they you have nice clothes they are clean oh they're very smart they graduated college but you know they just don't take care of their looks. You can make any story you want in your brain and connect search up with it as long as it's a lot old yes a subject where old people are involved or when you will think someone will call her that old lady over there for example some to get somewhere just anything like that so I can go on forever but I felt like for flying until you for example because it looks like you're going to head that way so if you are not her then do yourself a favor don't grow up to be like her live your life yeah married have kids have grandkids don't be sitting next to your daughter and her kids which is your grandkids will be confused my grandmother got awesome flows that would look good on me that's what 18 year old would be saying LOL she probably would be telling people you believe that's my daughter now that's my sister but she cancelled my mom it's not working and like I said even if it does it will always you McKay Bruce Kardashian if that's his name Bruce from that trash  Kardashian life or tv or some shit.. it's amazing how you got to be is a whore and you get famous and make money these days WTF I thought the Kardashians were some actors or some Hollywood producers just cocksuckers and stepfather who became a a stepmother that's what's wrong. Also in this community of our country this new generation so many fathers are not around but also so many mothers are evil bitches that want to keep the kids and some I'm not doing it for money not all females want to keep the children so she can get child support some females don't even want child support they want the father to stay away and that's their mission but some mothers can't stand the father but they still want him to have a relationship with his kids even if he doesn't have a right on the court gives you 100% full custody she still will try to let him meet his kids and be there for them if he wants but unfortunately that's only a small percentage so do do that major collapse of Mother's keeping the kids especially the boys yes especially the boys being around a bunch of females since day one and only gets to see his father once a month some don't even get to see their father at all what happens then by the time they are 10 years old they're gay when they're eight they start behaving gay they grow up they become gays because that's all they seen his kids and that's who raised them a woman Can't Raise a Man they used 2 but.not this age. She keeps men around as she and her friends try to raise a couple of boys out of three 100% one will come out gay 70% to will come out gay but yes  90% of the reason why a lot of boys grow up and turn out to be gay because they were raised by a woman who had other woman around her who was always getting dressed up and getting her hair done and had other kids who was girls so that boy gets confused and wants to do what they do so by the time he's old enough he will have a boyfriend by the age 18 he would have been slept probably with 5 other guys then he can marry another man LOL and he sure did his part of spreading disease STDs. ' why do you think they are spreading around faster than a wildfire because of the bisexual men which is the worst if you want to be gay just be gay sleep with men only there is nothing worse than a bisexual he sleeps with a man they poke each other in the ass. Yes they turn that butt crack into a sexual Place . I place in your body where you shipped from where you get that diseases out your body which is called shit poop then they take their penis and try to wash the poop off of it I don't understand and don't wanna but I do know when you do that you sleep with a guy then you going to sleep with the women so you had your penis in some guy's butt a dairy whole then you go and sleep with a girl then the girl sleeps with another guy and so on chances are you have now spread of disease and its a 70% chance yes scientifically studied so if science is trying to explain to you and tell you and the medical world and the technology we have how that's how you spread diseases that's how you get AIDS that's how all these guys are getting AIDS and they still try to say you're born that way or my favorite they try to act like they are the cleanest people in public why do you think they do that try to dress nice and stay clean because they know how nasty and there they are in bed so you just grow up and learn as you grow up",

She goes on chat apps and other social media to meet somebody new. Constantly bringing in strangers to their shared place. Sometimes it’s a new guy every week or another ex she’s dumped previously and has decided to start up with them again. \n\nFather of my coworkers daughter is starting to get lonely. So he starts using social media to find a new love interest and he actually finds a steady relationship....WITH A MAN! 😂😂😂\n\nSure enough my hussy coworker sees this stable relationship and starts getting to know her ex’s new boyfriend and starts developing feelings for him. YES, FEELINGS FOR A GAY MAN! \n\nNow all 3 of them and the little girl live together under 1 roof in a 2 bedroom apartment and sometimes her new bf lives with them and is about to bring his newborn child he had with another suicidal psychotic woman who is currently locked up in a mental institution. \n\nAnd yes they do have orgys together. Even after she got her baby daddy’s bf a job where she works and he belittled her in front of others and then stopped showing up for his shifts. \n\nSo much more to the story but I don’t have enough time to type it all out. 😂😂😂",

    "commentText": "Way too over-dramatic for my taste.  I would never buy a property from her!  The baby is too cute though!!  And she completely over-estimated the selling prospect of her property.  What she has is a co-op not a condo which means is that she doesn't really own her own property but a % share of the whole building and in order to sell the property, she has to get the approval of the entire building and because of that it's extremely difficult to sell co-op type of property.  This type of property is very common in New York especially the older ones.  She's a \"billion-dollar\" real estate broker and I can't believe she didn't know that.  Well the listing history exactly proved my suspicion.  She first listed her property in 2013 for $24 million and then just kept dropping the price further and further and further and further down to $17 million and she still couldn't sell it after THREE years.    https://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/central-park-west/the-beresford-211-central-park-west/apartment-1718J/sold/A222127.  In 2016, it was finally sold for $3 million from her ex to her.  My guess:  They finally have had it living with each other and she paid her ex $3 million for him to move out!  LOL  If I were the ex, seeing how attached she is to the apartment, I would've extracted more money than $3 million from her, at least half of $17 million.  That property was supposed to be split half and half if it had been sold and it's not the ex's fault that the property is co-op and is tough to sell.",

That she's the one paying alimony... that means her earning potential is much more than the husband, that's good, it's so nice to see stories like this.

I don't feel one bit sorry for them, they are living like kings & queens acting like a bunch of fools putting their kids through hell & they prob don't think twice about others less fortunate than them living on the streets of NYC right out side their very polished door! Poor them.. To have such problems they created themselves when instead they could have used their time, energy & money to do good, be a positive example for their children & help & give back to their community!",

No longer just HERS so they just wanna do the guy in like that because that's all loser girls do anyway they take everything a man worked his life for long before getting married and then these little girls wonder why a shitload of us men are MGTOW now..

If he is so responsible he can move out and would still get proceeds from the sale but he is a bum who wants to continue to suck off of what she earns. He is not even helping to pay for upkeep of the house. I guess that means he is RESPONSIBLE huh? Dont you see it is HE who is trying to take what she has made? She is not even blaming hin for that...she just want him to move out. He is only staying to spite her. No serious man is that stupid. He is entitled to something since he was around while she was making HER money that SHE WORKED HARD FOR but to try suck more out of her? Karma is a bitch...he will get back everything he doing to her and much more when he get his 10 million and some young girl leaches herself to him ALL IN THE NAME OF LOVE.",
