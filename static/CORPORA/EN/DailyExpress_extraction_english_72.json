        "postText": "'The upmarket chicken caesar roll in Heston Blumenthal's range sparked outrage and ridicule on social media for marketing itself as a choice for males.', 'The \u00a33.80 sandwich contains pulled smoked chicken, smoked bacon, parmesan and anchovy mayonnaise, similar to gentleman\u2019s relish.', 'The packaging shows a cockerel dressed in fishing waders and carrying a fishing rod.', 'Campaign group \u2018Everyday Sexism\u2019 was told about the butty battle, with Sadiq Khan\u2019s night czar Amy Lame tagging the group in her tweet. She said: I never knew sandwiches were gender specific. I\u2019m female but thankfully Waitrose let me purchase this anyway.', 'Peeved males replied to her tweet saying they happily eat Pink Lady and Granny Smith apples.', 'One wrote: Wait till you hear about Gentleman\u2019s Relish and Ladyfingers.', 'Another said: I\u2019m male and I love to eat Pink Lady and Granny Smith Apples! I also liked what was on the front of Woman's Weekly should that not be renamed 'Persons Weekly' Waitrose have apologised! Whatever next! Ridiculous.', But a number of women were irked by the packaging writing: I\u2019 m female and I used to read Men's Health  magazine - and I ate all of King Edwards potatoes (when he wasn't looking).', 'Following the outcry, Waitrose said it would change the name of the sandwich.', 'A spokesman said: It 's never our intention to cause offence - we're not dictating who should eat this sandwich - we hope anyone who tries it will love the distinctive flavours.However we are planning to change the name of the sandwich soon.', 'The call to cut the sandwich was similar to Nestle\u2019s Yorkie bars which kept a slogan It\u2019s not for girls for 10 years much to the annoyance of women around the UK.', 'They eventually dropped the slogan in 2012.'",
