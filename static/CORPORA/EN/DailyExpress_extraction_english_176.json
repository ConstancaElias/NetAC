        "postText": "'Even by the increasingly jack-booted, idiotic measures of the modern left it was some insult. But, insulting as it was, it was even more baffling. If the left truly finds modern Europe fascist then we can only conclude they really need to get out more. Here's what we know about western Europe \u2013 classical Europe, the Europe of Rome, Paris, Madrid, Berlin and of course London.','The people largely do not tolerate racism, the political system is largely democratic. Women are not routinely treated as second class citizens and members of the LGBT community do not face being put to death or jailed for life for falling love with someone.','You may feel there's something to be celebrated there, to be treasured perhaps, or to be fiercely protected.','And yet VDL was labelled fascist for even mentioning it.', 'Fascist.', 'As insults to Germans go that's as aggressive as it gets.', 'But, depressingly, it's not surprising. The left in Britain and Europe is becoming increasingly intolerant and the politics increasingly angry. The left's bid to thwart Brexit and basically get its own way at home and abroad is both breathtakingly furious and, so-far, dangerously successful.', 'Seriously, they are so angry it's befuddling their brains.', 'The press release on VDL's 'Vice-President for protecting our European way of life' had barely hit my in-box before the knee-jerk, dog-whistle stuff was barrelling in from all the usual corners.', 'Jean-Claude Juncker led the charge fatuously claiming I don\u2019t like the idea that the European way of life is opposed to migration - not that anyone, anywhere, said it was.', 'French Green MEP Damien Careme, called the move an abomination\u201d and environment campaigners Friends of the Earth called it facist thinking. Even Amnesty said the move sent a worrying message.', 'It's that sacred cow of migration you see.', 'Now, any sane person knows that migration not only keeps life culturally interesting and healthy but is vital for economic prosperity longer term. No-brainer. But any sane person also knows that not all people and not all nations and not all cultural norms are created equal.', 'But even whisper this and you are likely to invoke the knee-jerk incantations of racist and/or fascist.', 'So I would just ask the detractors, those who would determinedly attack our way of life to have a quick gander at this list:', 'Afghanistan, Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Nigeria, Pakistan, Qatar, Sudan, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia.', 'That's where you will be stoned to death or hanged if you're gay., 'No Holland, Germany or Spain there you'll note., 'Not convinced?', 'Try this list:', 'Egypt, Qatar, Oman, Uganda, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran.', 'That's where life will be very difficult if you are a woman \u2013 you'll be lucky to vote, extremely lucky to be educated to any meaningful level, and often be told what to wear and how to behave.', 'Again, no sign of Sweden, Greece, or Belgium.','Western Europe, tolerant, intelligent, and successful has much much to be proud of and we should celebrate this rather than berate ourselves for not being perfect.', 'There is always work to be done fighting racism, sexism and homophobia and we should never let our guard drop for one moment.', 'But sometimes, just sometimes, can't we allow ourselves a quick pat on the back?', 'The late Kurt Vonnegut was apt to note when things are going good don't forget to notice.','It remains good advice.'",

In fact, none were asked and no consent sought to make the radical changes imposed on the UK and wider Europe by self-serving politicians. We can't just blame the Left, though. In the UK, businesses and the politicians who represented their interests loved immigration and its ability to keep wages and working conditions down and training costs at a minimum by importing people from the 1960 s onwards.The Left are relative newcomers, but they too now revel in importing 'grateful voters' to keep themselves in power, as they \"rubbed our noses in diversity\". If like, me and my partner, you have moved from areas of high and very high <b> immigrant </b>population to one where the percentage is relatively low you will see at first hand just how much immigration has cost our society in every possible way.",

I mean I wouldn 't because i think the whole thing was a cynical grab for votes and to ally themselves further with groups that hate us and western values. But if we did it for a thought experiment;i.e allowing people from very poor and backward countries to come here for economic opportunities, mass immigration STILL doesn't make any sense. There' s about 5 billion people that would want to come to the West for economic reasons. Even a tenth of that number would completely destabilize our societies. No another way must be found and it is being found as the West evolves we bring everyone up with us, slowly. we can also trade more fairly and stop propping up dictators and engaging in speculative wars. But this globalist multiculty thing is probably even more dangerous than communism and fascism combined if we don 't resist it!",

The fact that you are a lying b 'tard and made up porkies enroute still encourages  support - the irony being today, that very few of the support are actually hard up - I'd even suggest to most of the hard - ups, this new lot look very similar to the ones the hard - ups believe are causing them to be hard - up. Then overlay all this with the media / reporting / etc - the biggest conners of the lot getting their oars in -so any <b> old </b>thing is in play.IMO.",
