        "postText": " She's so sexy!  Clearly a complement, right?  Terri Vescio discusses how well performing women can be threatening and are often sexualized in ways that can make women feel psychologically and physically unsafe. Theresa K. Vescio is a Professor of Psychology and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality studies. Her research seeks to understand the factors that facilitate and temper the expression of sexism, racism, and heterosexism. Dr. Vescio has two lines of research that are funded by the National Science Foundation \u2013 research on the underrepresentation of women in masculine domains (e.g., science, technology, engineering, business) and her research on masculinity. Dr. Vescio has published numerous articles, edited a volume on The Social Psychology of Power (with Ana Guinote), served as Associate Editor for both the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Interpersonal Relations and Group Processes and the British Journal of Social Psychology, and served on the editorial boards of Psychological Science, the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Attitudes and Social Cognition, and Social Psychology and Personality Science. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx ",

For one thing we objectify all women not just powerful ones. And it's wrong but those pics aren't that bad. The women look like athletes with hair and makeup. I think most women would do that if they were having their photo published in the magazine. As a matter fact Oprah makes a point of doing that on the cover of a magazine, I don't think a man did that to her. Ironically it's a little bit sexist for her to assume that the women don't have agency over their own image . But her thoughts on men are very profound to me.",

In fact, this is such a neglected Buisness branche that some of my friends have built independent Buisnesses around it, that are highly successfull without even having a mentionable reach. I, by the way, do believe this also goes both ways.

Honestly it's ridiculous wanting to redefine something unless you realize it was defined wrongly in the first place. They realize that it's integral for almost all men to consider themselves masculine. They don't like masculinity and don't want men to be masculine. So instead of telling men to be feminine instead of masculine they want to \"redefine\" masculinity letting men live under the illusion that they're still masculine. They want to redefine masculinity as femininity or a mixture of both.",

Unfortionalty, she didn't talk about what men face the full extent, which is just as bad, and that leads to a problem; women feel more afraid, and men can't get help. I would note that most male rapists are also victims of paedophilia form older women. The fact of the matter is that women get so much more support though sexist harm and that is mainly because of mainstream feminism and talks like this. I am not saying that these talks should go, I am saying they need to take into account the full picture. I have a feeling most of us agree on this issue, but due to movements like 3rd wave Feminism and to less extent MGTOW we are held apart, you can't poison half a well. Why must we identify with a side here? I support<b>  gender</b> equality. Feminism and MGTOW are not only not that, but they are activly are hurting equality.",

Then D\u00e1vid Danos replies giving some potential reasoning to justify the structure choices that the presenter made.  You then come along and accuse ether Wyatt Davis or D\u00e1vid Danos (not clear which it was) of being defensive.  I may be jumping to conclusions here but in my experience when some one accuses someone of being defensive and it is unclear as to why this blame is being made, that is usually a sign that the accuser them selfs are feeling defensive.",

You talk about women having a \"hive mind\". Do you mean that we tend to stick together more? Everybody finds safety in numbers, this is true for everybody and if you do not feel safe or heard (like women or minorities) all the more likely you'll stick to that group. If you look at the men's clubs that have been everywhere in society, wouldn't that also count as a \"hive mind\"? And isn't accusing a <b> woman </b>that she had those sexist comments (or worse) coming because of what she wore also slander?\nThis speech is not an attack on men, she talks about<b>  sexism</b> on both sides. Men are being discriminated against, just like women and that's why we need eachother in this fight. Because this fight is not against any of the sexes, this fight is for humanity. \nThere is another TED talk that might be an interesting point of view that explains why it's important to stand up for women: violence against women\u2014it's a men's issue: Jackson Katz at TEDxFiDiWomen",
