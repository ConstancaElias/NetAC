        "postText": "European officials are meeting today to discuss the length of the latest delay to Brexit with the choice between a three-month wait and a two-tier exit.', 'However, they may not actually decide today and a result could be expected on Monday.', 'It has emerged that France is leading calls for the UK to leave within the next two weeks after Boris Johnson lost crucial votes in Parliament, leaving the decision over a delay to EU leaders.', 'European Council president Donald Tusk has said that he would push for a three-month delay.', 'However, French President Emmanuel Macron is said to be leading a rebellion that includes Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and possibly the Netherlands calling for a shorter extension. Mr Tusk has the backing of Germany and Ireland for the longer extension.', 'The Prime Minister challenged MPs to back his call for a General Election on December 12 in return for more time to scrutinise his Brexit deal as he tried to break the deadlock.', 'Mr Johnson will need Labour votes if he is to win the attempt on Monday, with a \u2018super majority\u2019 of two-thirds of MPs required to get an election under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act (FTPA).', 'Jeremy Corbyn said his decision would come after inspecting the terms of any extension to Article 50 granted by Brussels, which he was expecting to come on Friday.', 'The PM said the outcome of the announcement was \u2018likely\u2019 to be the delay until January 31 which he was compelled to request by Parliament.', 'Though his latest gambit, which saw him shelve his pledge to deliver Brexit by the October 31 deadline \u2018do or die\u2019, could have provoked the EU to rethink and delay the announcement.', 'In a threat interpreted as the Government effectively going on strike if it loses, a spokesman for the PM said: \u2018Nothing will come before Parliament but the bare minimum.', '\u2018We will pursue a General Election every day from then onwards and do everything we can to get it.\u2019', 'A No 10 source said this would include the scrapping of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which is required to ratify the deal.', 'Mr Johnson was compelled to ask for the delay by the Benn Act after he failed to get approval for his Brexit timetable at Saturday\u2019s special sitting of Parliament.', 'But in a move to win over MPs, he has offered them until November 6 to debate and vote on his deal.', 'Then Parliament would be dissolved, paving the way for the first December election since 1923.', 'If Mr Corbyn does not back the FTPA on Monday, it will be the third time he has been offered a General Election and refused.', 'He said: \u2018Take no-deal off the table and we absolutely support a General Election.\u2019', 'Mr Johnson said it would be \u2018morally incredible\u2019 if opposition MPs refused to go along with his plan now.', 'But they lined up to reject his proposed timetable, criticising it for still giving too little time for proper scrutiny of the Bill in Parliament.', 'The SNP, Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru, all roundly refused to give their backing to the Mr Johnson\u2019s plan.', 'Dominic Grieve, one of the 21 MPs exiled from the Tories by the PM, also said he would not back the election plan, describing it to BBC\u2019s Newsnight as a form of \u2018blackmail\u2019.",
