When the goal is reached, they will be \"lined up against the wall\". \n\n [LINK] \n1984 interview with a former KGB agent and Soviet diplomat, Yuri Bezmenov.\nReminds me of the many reports regarding American and Canadian daughters of a bitches in America and Canada which is an overboard political correctness cultural marxism country which we Russians created to destroy the American and Canadian family. destroy the family then you destroy the brick of society, destroy many bricks then the entire building goes down. \n\nThat building is the American and Canadian<b>  nation</b> and we of the former KGB now known as the FSB are very proud of what we just did and you Canadians and Americans think you won the cold war? No! We russians won the cold war for we have destroyed the western family! Destroy the family then society collapses, when society collapses then the economy collapses, when the economy that supports the military collapses then all U.S and Canadian militaries collapses.\n\nWe Russians won the Cold War for look at your societies, over 50% divorce rares, out of control insane feminism, indiscrimination against the while caucasian mal<b> e gende</b>r in all walks of life, the feminization of education in order to destroy  the intellectual a<b> nd ment</b>al potentials of boys and men by deliberately ignoring their educational and intellectual needs by ignoring the difference of thinking pattern between male and female, open and outright  indiscrimination against male co-workers in the work place and places of learning, etc.\n\nPolitical correctness is TYRANNY WITH A SMILE. PC particularly serves mediocre politicians and the bureaucrats they appoint.  It is used to hold on to jobs, silencing critics and threatening anyone who questions their abilities.  If the offended party can strike back with accusation<b>  of rac</b>ism, discrimination, prejudice, and hatred, then PC has done its job.  PC is a way of covering up incompetence and corruption.  It has worked well in the U.S. for decades: attack the accuser.  Benjamin Jealous, president of the NAACP, wrote, \"Let me tell you something about political correctness: when politicians start overdoing it with PC, rest assured they're either hopeless at what they do or have screwed everything up big time.",

In regards to <b> woman </b>doing the same jobs. Your forgetting men simply are able to push themselves more Pyschically Eg male builders can lift more and do more and there body is capable of outputting more energy as a result the muscles and body can be more tense and painfull than the female equivalent.\n\nI know what your trying to say but it just isn't 'Equal' like you want it to be because men and women are different females doing the same jobs you mentioned are not capable of doing them as well outside of say office work or multi task based jobs in which they can exceed men.",

The majority of men could also not vote as it was very difficult to vote usually required lots of time money and extra effort.\n\nObvisouly this is wrong as giving everyone a chance to vote was a massive achievement towards true democracy.\n\nWhat I am saying is everyone has less rights not just women.

The balance of the natural order has been turned upside down deliberately, by some of the most evil people the west has ever known. The more subtlety used, the more evil it is. Never has their evil been so subtle or so many people been so taken in by it. So many men see no hope in society. Their jobs, good character, financial security, and finally, their dignity, have all been taken off them and given to women. At the same time, women are encouraged to deprive men of their children, home, jobs and again, with all of that always goes dignity. THESE are the reasons the despicable TV panel lead discussion  shows deliberately ignore, and patronisingly say 'poor men' without helping in any constructive way. Feminism and the <b> misandry </b>that ALWAYS goes with it, and gynocentric biased law systems are DESPERATELY EVIL. In countries where abortive murder and even live abortion is legal, these things are not surprising. These things are also the real reason for the very high numbers of men's suicide.",

I am actually going to go into a library and ask a female librarian for a book on women's rights. She'll probably smile that a man is interested in the subject. I will then place it in the correct section ie. the fiction section. Then go and tell her that it is now in the correct section and enjoy watching her smile melt into a frown.",

Some other man knocked her up, but I need to give up MY seat and I'm not even the one who hit that? Nah, son.",

Did she want the seat? With how far women take equality this equality that these days I won't be surprised if she actually had a go at a few of the for offering her seat and is she the only female there? If not is it not sexist for only males to get picked on? I honestly think there is more to this story than just the question asked because I can't honestly think this would happen in the house of commons of all places for no reason.
