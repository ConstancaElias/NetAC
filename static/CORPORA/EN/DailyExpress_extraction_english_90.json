She revealed this truth when she left the house and it was, well, right there on her head.', 'It is glorious because, same.', 'The author of the article goes on to explain that she also has grey hairs, adding: Every few weeks I see a grey hair sprout up on my head, inevitably glinting proudly right on my part.', ' It seems like the colourless ones grow faster and more determinedly than my non - grey hairs, but that 's beside the point\u2014every time I see one, I think what do I do with you?', 'But even though the article was not cast in a negative light, it sparked outrage online. ', 'One Twitter user wrote: Hopefully God will forgive Meghan Markle for committing the unpardonable sin of having a grey hair.', 'Thanks Marie Claire for confirming that I'm not missing anything other than everyday sexism by not buying your magazine.', 'Another said: Shame on Marie Claire for this nonsense about Meghan Markle and a grey hair.','One woman wrote: That 's disgusting in my opinion. Marie Claire as a women's magazine has to support women.It is totally normal to have grey hair.', 'Some users took to the social platform to joke about their own grey hair.', 'Another furious tweeter wrote: Seriously Marie Claire this is not what a strong confident modern woman wants to read about!', 'No wonder I stopped buying your magazine!I 've way more important things to worry about than another woman's grey hair!', 'One person said: So I guess Marie Claire posted an article about Meghan Markle's one grey hair., ' * Clicks on Twitter.Sees that Marie Claire has tweeted about Meghan Markle having ONE GREY HAIR.Closes Twitter again, thinking dark thoughts.*', 'I\u2019m seven years younger than her and I've got a head full of them.NOBODY CARES.', 'One comment read: If Meghan Markle 's lone grey hair on her head is news, my grey pube is available for interview.', 'While another sarcastic user wrote: I can't believe Meghan Markle 's grey hair is single. IT'S A TOTAL CATCH!'",
