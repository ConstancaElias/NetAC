You think America is going to be resolved overnight anyway, if we left with WTO tomorrow?, no its not, that alone will take 12 to 18 months minimum to put in place, so why not kick off the american negotiations and keep Free Trade with the EU whilst we are doing it? You say the Transition period is undefined, thats not the case, its 1 year, with the option of a 1 or 2 year extension, but with the conservatives now saying, end of December 2020 or we leave on WTO.",
