        "postText": "Far-right activist Tommy Robinson is recorded making a racist slur and brags about getting drugs \u2018everywhere he goes\u2019 in a video that has emerged today.', 'The founder of the English Defence League, who has several criminal convictions including for cocaine possession, is seen in the video claiming:', '\u2018No matter where I\u2019ve gone in the world I score, I\u2019ve gone to f***ing Qatar, to Doha, and scored gear on the sesh while they\u2019re all praying.', '\u2018Everywhere mate, every city I\u2019ve gone to\u2019.', 'The video, obtained by the Sun, shows Robinson, taking a stroll down the Italian city of Bologna last month.', 'He then appears to make racist comments while asking for a taxi, which he describes as \u2018little P*** that drives a car\u2019.', 'In the drunken video recorded on his phone, he also shouts about being the \u2018king of the whole Islam race\u2019 and fighting for Israel if war broke out with Palestine.', 'Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, went on Facebook to respond to the publication of his video, claimed it was shared with friends in a private group.', 'He went on to claim that he was \u2018very drunk\u2019 when the video was made and that his comments were \u2018banter\u2019.', 'Today he denied he had bought drugs in Qatar, claiming it would have been near impossible for him to do so.', 'Robinson is currently in the middle of a row tearing Ukip apart, after its leader Gerard Batten appointed him as a \u2018special adviser\u2019 last year.', 'His role reportedly includes specialising in the areas of \u2018rape gangs\u2019 and prison conditions.', 'Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the party faced \u2018total and utter marginalisation\u2019 for working with the far-right campaigner.', 'Youtube suspended adverts on Robinson\u2019s account last month, saying he breached rules which prohibit the promotion of \u2018hatred, intolerance and discrimination\u2019.",
