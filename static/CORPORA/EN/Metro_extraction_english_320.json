        "postText": "A kidnap gang tortured and shaved a transgender woman\u2019s head after she refused to pay them extortion money, activists have claimed.', 'Shakeela, 27, was allegedly taken during the first day of Eid last week and held against her will for three hours.', 'She says she was threatened with further violence if she did not pay the gang one million rupees (\u00a35,200).', 'Shakeela has come forward with Pakistan\u2019s Trans Action support group to put pressure on local police to investigate the attack.', 'Pakistan is a deeply religious conservative country and homosexuality is illegal, but last year new laws were introduced letting people self-identify their gender on official documents.', 'Despite the recent progression, Farzana Jan, the president of Trans Action, told Metro.co.uk that transgender women are at the mercy of gangs in the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.', 'Farzana, who was the first Pakistani to have a gender-neutral \u2018X\u2019 passport, says 64 transgender people have been killed in the province since 2015, while more than 600 have been tortured.', 'She told Metro.co.uk: \u2018There is an organised group of criminal gangs who specifically target the transgender community because they are more vulnerable.', '\u2018They\u2019re involved not only in the sexual exploitation of the transgender community but they extort money from them.', '\u2018They are seen as weak and easy targets.\u2019', 'Farzana said Shakeela, who works as a dancer in the city of Mardan, had paid the gang twice before.', 'She said: \u2018Initially she paid 40,000 rupees and then 50,000 rupees.', '\u2018It\u2019s a kind of safety money which you pay and you can work and dance in the area.', '\u2018Now they have demanded a huge amount. They\u2019ve asked for one million Pakistani rupees.', '\u2018It\u2019s impossible for Shakeela to pay this money.\u2019', 'Farzana said attacks like these \u2018are not new\u2019, adding: \u2018This is happening throughout Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.', '\u2018These organised criminal gangs are active all over the province.', '\u2018We see a large number of people who either pay money or don\u2019t and they are killed or tortured.\u2019', 'She claims some arrests are made after attacks are shared on social media but they never lead to convictions.', 'She said: \u2018The violence is high on the ground but the prosecution and conviction rate is zero.\u2019', 'Pakistan passed the transgender persons protection of rights act in May 2018, but Farzana says \u2018the progress and implementation is almost nil\u2019.', 'She added: \u2018Yes, there is some kind of change at the grassroots level but the challenge of the transgender community all across Pakistan, and especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, remains the same.\u2019",

Most women don't even wear a hijab like they do in actual Muslim conservative countries and in case YOU are forgetting wasnt a <b> lesbian </b>couple attacked in London last week?? Is this place conservative and Muslim? No. More Muslim bashing with your pathetic journalism. Men walk round holding hands in Pakistan as it is a sign or friendship and respect. The term 'Hijra' which is a very<b>  old</b> word for th<b> e Transgende</b>r community, if anything, are considered a group of people that bring good luck. As for talking about homosexuality being illegal - yet no laws actually being implemented - this was a law brought in by the BRITS when under colonial rule. Like with many countries, there are still people with a very backwards mentality so this is not a 'Pakistani' problem but a worldwide one. So put that in your idiotic pipe and smoke it.",

                    "commentText": "If Pakistan is such a wonderful places and  one of the most beautiful countries in the world, why do we have so many Pakistanis living here? I assume you live in Pakistan, so maybe you could answer why so many Pakistanis came here pretendinng to be Syrian refugees? Homosexuality was legalised in 1967, in Britain, so why is there such hate by so very many Muslims towards <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>people? There are attacks here agains<b> t g<b> a</b</b>>y <b> and lesb</b>ian couples, appalling but relatively few.  In Muslim countries, including Pakistan, few would dare to say they ha<b> ve a se</b>xual preference for the<b>  sam</b>e sex. Is it not against Islam and so from the 7th Century, than anything to do with the British invading? This is why w<b> e n<b> ee<<b> /b</b</b>>>d LGBT education in British schools because there are so many of our schools with large numbers of Muslim children and it is good that our children benefit from the education and much of that will be set in the context of their family values and beliefs. It is apparent by the Muslim parents protesting against this, that those Muslim children will be denied any choice o<b> ver the</b>ir sexual preference and yet there will be Muslim girls who have already had no choices and undergone FGM, here in Britain, which is illegal here in Britain and yet there is a NHS clinic in London for those girls who are butchered and who need skilled medical treatment, There have been only 1 or 2 people charged, why? Because Mulsims keep this butchering, in the name of Islam, of baby girls and little girls, secret. There will be girls who will have no choice over a husband and will be married off fr<b> om 9</b> years old onwards, which is also illegal here in Britain, but do not let them be edu<b> cat<b> ed<<b> /b</b</b>>> about LGBT's. It is not acepted in Islam. The religion of no choices? It is an ideology, how things 'should be'.I think there are many levels of mentality and it will be dependant on culture, to some degree, but any culture that lets FGM and child brides be acceptable, is a very backward culture, in my opinion and that it happens here in Britain, is appalling.

You might want to have a word with your<b>  racist</b> colonial ancestors as to why half of the world's population has ended up in the UK. You might want to educate yourself a little better as th<b> e Lesbia</b>n couple that were attacked in London last week were attacked by 4 white teens. Most likely people like your kids considering how insideous<b> ly raci</b>st you are. It wouldnt be suprising if you had raised people the same way. Full of spite, hatred and idiocy. Pakistan is part of the Commonwealth. You will rarely get refugees from there. Exactly what would they be seeking refuge from? The invisible wars they are involved with? FGM is a cultural issue not a religious one. From predominan<b> tly Afri</b>can nations. Again your lack of education is at best, comical. As for child brides. I think you will find that the US is the biggest culprit. You know, the US? That massive MU<b> SLIM na</b>tion. Get off Google, your pathetic reaching and actually get out there ANNE. There is no Sharia Law in the UK and no calls for it. Again your stupidity is a joke. Jimmy Saville was a Muslim was he? Was Gary Glitter too? No they were one of your people ANNE. The only backwards one is you. What an embarassing cowardly individual you are. Be a <b> proud r</b>acist and say it with your chest. Although considering literally everything you said was made up, i would keep it to myself if I were you for fear of being the laughing stock that you actually are. ANNE.",
