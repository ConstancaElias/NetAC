        "postText": "Another week, another Twitter storm over \u2018PC-mad\u2019, \u2018virtue-signalling\u2019 advertising.', 'Before I watched the latest Gillette advert, I was dubious.', 'I\u2019d read a lot of angry comments on Twitter and assumed the brand had gone and \u2018done a Pepsi\u2019 (the campaign involving Kendall Jenner, which was ridiculed for co-opting civil rights protest movements, and was eventually pulled).', 'When brands reference social movements in their advertising, the tone can sometimes be way off the mark. But this razor advert is cut to precision.', 'If you haven\u2019t watched it yet, please do. It addresses issues of toxic masculinity, bullying, sexual harassment and the objectification of women, claiming that the brand \u2018believe[s] the best in men\u2019 and that \u2018it\u2019s only by challenging ourselves to do more that we can get closer to our best\u2019.', '', 'The advert is a celebration of change in a post-#MeToo era. It shows men sticking up for women, sticking up for each other and includes a clip of arguably the most masculine man on the planet, actor Terry Crews, calling for men to \u2018hold other men accountable\u2019.', 'Who could possibly fault a message like that?', 'Thousands, apparently. The advert has over 846,000 dislikes on its YouTube platform, and the comments underneath are disturbing.', 'Some of these men claim to be \u2018boycotting\u2019 the brand, arguing the advert is part of a \u2018war on masculinity\u2019 and taking offence at the \u2018PC agenda\u2019 of the film.', 'Presumably they miss the adverts of a bygone era when three blades were sufficient and having a smooth face would help you \u2018get the girl\u2019. It won\u2019t.', 'But being an honest ally to women and stopping others from treating us like garbage is a step in the right direction, regardless of your relationship status.', 'The outrage caused by this advert justifies the need for its existence. Protesters describe it as an attack on their masculinity.', '\u2018You can\u2019t grow a beard anyway, mate\u2019, is an attack on masculinity. Discouraging sexual and physical assault is not.', '', 'Boycotters feel that by appealing for all men to do better, Gillette are suggesting all men are to blame.', 'This is obviously a gross misunderstanding. Not all men are culpable, but all men are capable of making a positive difference.', 'People moan about politically correct culture as if it\u2019s some sort of totalitarian regime. Being \u2018PC\u2019 is essentially about being polite and considerate. Neither of which are particularly political.', 'There isn\u2019t much in our current political landscape to help guide our moral compass.', 'If recent Brexit discussions show us anything, it\u2019s that not one person in politics knows what on earth the correct thing to do is.', 'However, if we are going to truly fix the issues identified in the Gillette advert, we can\u2019t simply dismiss the opinions of those who oppose it. There\u2019s obviously something still missing.', 'For a group of people to feel emasculated by such an advert suggests a feeling of misplaced disenfranchisement and anger that should be ignored at our peril.', 'To witness a large group lashing out at such a positive message is concerning. But how do we bridge that gap?', 'As addressed in the advert itself, the advertising industry has profited from the objectification and sexualisation of women for decades. For a global advertiser to turn around and ask individuals to pick up the pieces is bound to evoke a defensive anger.', 'It wasn\u2019t so long ago that Gillette themselves advertised their logo across the latexed arses of grid girls. And let\u2019s not forget, the advertisers they paid for the campaign aren\u2019t stupid.', '\u2018Wokeness\u2019 sells just as much as \u2018sex\u2019 nowadays, and it\u2019s done its job at getting the brand into the headlines, so there\u2019s reason to be cynical. But if we look at the bigger picture, at least a platform so far-reaching and influential is being used to promote vital positive change, no matter the motivation.', 'I get it. I\u2019d be pretty angry too if, after years of showing women drooling over a scantily clad window cleaner/gardener/pool boy, Diet Coke released an advert telling women to stop being such a bunch of perverts and look the other way.', 'My anger would probably stem from the fact that I hadn\u2019t questioned it before, and that I didn\u2019t call them out first.', 'Advertisers prey on insecurity \u2013 it\u2019s their currency. But here we have a campaign that does the opposite. I want men to feel secure enough to hear an adjective like \u2018toxic\u2019 and not feel threatened by it.', 'To the men who do: I\u2019m sorry.', 'I\u2019m sorry you feel so disconnected from the benefits of a movement that you view it as oppressive. I\u2019m sorry you feel intimidated instead of empowered by it.', 'I\u2019m sorry that you may not feel any tangible privilege in your own life in a world that tells you that you should.', 'But this advert isn\u2019t a threat to a man\u2019s right to be masculine, it\u2019s a celebration of it. It is not an attack on your behaviour, but an attack on a system of oppression that has been around for so long we need all the help we can get to change it.', 'This is a call to arms. Not against us, but with us.', 'We must help educate each other and future generations, because becoming a man is about more than just learning how to shave.",

The fact I am secure in the knowledge I'm a nice guy is the very reason I find it offensive being chastised by a souless global corporation trying to pander to militant feminism. Neither of those groups are qualified in the slightest to judge my behaviour. Why don't I go around telling women not to be moody, money-grabbing, attention-seeking naggers? Because it's an extremely offensive generalisation which is exactly what this advert is!! That feminists like you are trying to justify it is utterly disgraceful and devalues your movement immensely.",

We all can and should improve so I hope their next female ad points out where women can change for the better too. How about changing their self image and promoting their natural selves instead of living behind filters? Or will it be the usual perfect models dancing to a classic in bikinis like the Venus ads? This company has too much to answer for in how they have historically promoted <b> gender </b>stereotypes so maybe they should have apologised for their own influence before demanding men apply themselves.",

As a NEWS organisation I am sure metro is wise to this and is therefore complicit in this viral marketing. Non of this is news, not the reaction of feminists nor the offended men, not the \"journalism\" on display here. Its advertisers laughing that they have managed to get their brand into all the newspapers and center the conversation on themselves. Its criminal that this is allowed to pass for news.
