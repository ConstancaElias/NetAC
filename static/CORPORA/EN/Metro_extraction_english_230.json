        "postText": "Hobbit Humphrey and Jake England-Johns have revealed that they\u2019re not revealing the gender of their baby.', 'They are so protective over Anoush\u2019s gender that they did not even tell the 17-month-old\u2019s grandparents. It was only when one of them changed the child\u2019s nappy that they discovered what gender they are.', 'The parents, circus performers and members of Extinction Rebellion living on a houseboat near Bath, use gender-neutral pronouns \u2018they\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 and dress Anoush in both boy\u2019s and girl\u2019s clothes.', 'Hobbit and Jake said that they took the decision not to reveal their baby\u2019s identity because they don\u2019t want people treating them differently.', 'Instead Anoush, whose name was changed to Charlie for BBC One\u2019s Inside Out last night, will be able to chose their own gender and pronouns when they\u2019re older.', 'Hobbit said: \u2018So much of gender bias is unconscious. When I got pregnant we then were having a discussion about how we were going to mitigate the unconscious bias.', '\u2018And we figured that the only way we could do that was just not to tell people.', '\u2018To use the they/them pronoun for as long as we can, and create this little bubble for our baby to be who they are.', '\u2018Eventually they will get told by somebody that pink is only for girls and blue is only for boys, and you can\u2019t play with that because you are a particular sex.', '\u2018That\u2019s still a thing that happens these days. We\u2019re just trying to protect Anoush from that.\u2019', 'Jake said: \u2018Gender neutral refers to us trying to behave neutrally towards the child, rather than trying to make them neutral.', '\u2018We\u2019re not trying to make them be anything. We just want them to be themselves.\u2019', 'Hobbit\u2019s mum Camille, 64, said: \u2018It was a struggle, but as with any learning over time it became embedded and they became \u201cthey\u2019.\u2019', 'Jake added: \u2018We are quite good now at holding space for people\u2019s discomfort in us saying, \u201dActually, we don\u2019t tell anyone, we\u2019re not telling anyone for now\u201d. We\u2019re just letting Anoush be a baby.', '\u2018Anoush is the most lovely little human. They\u2019re into everything, they\u2019re really active \u2014 just a delight.\u2019', 'Hobbit said: \u2018It was tricky at first when not only were we new parents, but also new parents who had the problem of people getting upset about our baby being gender neutral.', '\u2018But in the end it has proven to be a really beautiful thing and we\u2019ve had a lot of important conversations from it.', '\u2018It has had the effect we wanted, of letting our baby develop its own interests regardless of gender. So, for example, while they love having a doll\u2019s tea party every morning, they also are really fascinated by motorbikes and machinery.', '\u2018Eventually once our baby is old enough, they can obviously decide for themselves what gender they want to be, but for now we just want them to be able to grow up in their own little bubble.\u2019",

I had \"alternative\" parents my sister climbed trees and did whatever she wanted she never felt held back but also enjoys her femininity. You can't force equality but making everything the same, viva is difference I say. Doing this does not show freedom it show an abuse of a position as a parent, we shoulf be there to guide them not force this cr@p on them",
