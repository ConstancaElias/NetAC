        "postText": "There are some ridiculous people out there who still think it\u2019s OK to \u2018black up\u2019.', 'Like this man, who was filmed wandering around Ibiza covered in black paint in a bid to resemble an African sunglasses vendor.', 'In the shocking clip, the man \u2013 who was on the island with a number of friends \u2013 can be seen wearing a monkey toy around his neck and an umbrella hat.', 'The footage was branded \u2018racist\u2019 and \u2018ridiculous\u2019 by hundreds of people on Facebook before the uploader pulled it from the internet.', 'In the video, crowds can be heard chanting \u2018looky looky\u2019 as some other men call over an actual vendor and tell them to stand together.', 'Despite friends of the man finding the clip funny, commenters online did not.', 'Simone Adele Brathwaite commented: \u2018So racist. He could\u2019ve done this without having to do black face.\u2019', 'Paul McEvoy said: \u2018What is going on here? Can nobody see this clear is racism and insensitive yet everyone is tagging their friends thinking it\u2019s funny?\u2019', 'Fayo Ibidapo added: \u2018This is disgusting! I hope all the people liking this and commenting monkey emojis know that this is blatant racism and blackface. You need to check yourselves. This is unacceptable.\u2019', 'The video comes just days after Alan Sugar sparked outrage after he posted a racist tweet about the Senegal World Cup football team.', 'Writing on Twitter, the host of BBC show The Apprentice wrote: \u2018I recognise some of these guys from the beach in Marbella. Multi tasking resourceful chaps.\u2019', 'Alongside his caption, he shared a picture of sunglasses and handbags on sale on what appears to be a beachfront to his 5.47million followers.', 'His tweet led to hundreds of people branding the 71-year-old entrepreneur \u2018racist\u2019. Yet despite this, Lord Sugar, who is the 95th richest person in the UK, defended his tweet and asked people what was wrong with it. In response to one person who called the post \u2018terrible\u2019, he replied: \u2018Why?\u2019",
