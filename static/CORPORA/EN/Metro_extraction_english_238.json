        "postText": "Anti-LGBT protesters were drowned out by a \u2018loving resistance\u2019 musical counter-protest when they returned to a Birmingham school.', 'Around 20 campaigners demonstrated near Anderton Park School, in Sparkhill, yesterday.', 'They were complaining about lessons where pupils learn about gay relationships and LGBT rights.', 'But this time they were met with resistance from gay mother Katy Rose Bennett, a local resident, and her friends who sang defiant songs of love, including A Beautiful World and Over the Rainbow.', 'Musician Ms Bennett said she decided to act after having to put up with protests at the school gates since January.', 'She said: \u2018We believe in love and harmony and everyone getting along and being equal. Love conquers hate.\u2019', 'Resident Philip Coker added: \u2018Their children are the future, but they just do not want them to have a future that is different from theirs.', '\u2018They are giving their children a terrible message.\u2019', 'Lead protester Mr Afsar said they returned because he didn\u2019t want the school to think they had gone away.', 'He said: \u2018We will not back down. Parents want us to continue to press for the school to heed their request, consult with parents and stop going against their wishes.\u2019', 'Fellow protester Amir Ahmed added: \u2018They say this is about equality and tolerance. There are other ways to teach equality \u2013 this is a sexual and gender ideology.\u2019', 'Birmingham City Council will again request a permanent injunction around the school to ban protests at the gates when it goes to court on October 14.', 'A temporary injunction, imposed in June, bans Mr Afsar and other protest leaders from organising a demonstration or abusing school employees inside an exclusion zone.', 'Anderton Park School was targeted along with Parkfield School in Alum Rock.', 'Anti-LGBT protesters started their demonstrations in March.",

However, I think you're right to point out that one doesn't have to believe all the doctrines of Islam, in order to disbelieve the silly doctrines of the new <b> LGB<b> T <<b> /b</b</b>>>religion that contradict what orthodox Muslims, Jews and Christians <b> in comm</b>on believe, and quite a lot of atheists to boot.I feel quite snubbed that the Metro didn't bother to mention me, along with Amir Ahmed and Shakeel Afsar, now that I'm a defendant too, in the High Court in Birmingham.It was a pretty biased piece of reportage, don't you think?  Shakeel especially deserves better press than he gets.I am surprised that so few newspapers even get as far at expressing the core dispute, easily expressed in the slogans, \"Our kids, our choice\" and \"Let kids be kids\".  There is a torrent of misinformation.  It is as if all the world's press were owned by the same individual, who happened to be a ra<b> bid<b>  L<<b> /b</b</b>>>GBT-ist.",

So your question is logically fallacious. What you really asked is: why do you think that your/anyone's religious beliefs carry more weight than other people's beliefs. And the answer is that noone's beliefs carry more weight. So be careful of logic.",

No one is teaching them about the ins and outs of <b> sexual </b>intercourse, just that sometimes men love men, women love women and some children have two parents of the same<b>  sex</b>. The problem is that children are taught discrimination from a youn<b> g ag</b>e by their families and schools can at least provide an alternative, more socially acceptable, counteracting viewpoint. Take a look at the picture above of those women with their heads and faces covered. My mother used to teach in a nursery school where the majority of children were Muslim. One girl asked her how she got to work and when she said she drove herself the girls thought it was strange and funny that she would. These were four ye<b> ar o</b>ld girls who'd already been tought as part of Muslim upbringing that women shouldn't be going out on their own and driving themselves to places because they had to have the supervision of men. I worry about children being pushed down the road of believing they<b> 're transgen</b>der and using puberty blocking drugs. I do think children should be allowed to be whoever they feel they are without concern for whether their physical bodies and feelings<b>  fit ge</b>nder stereotypes. However, the problem here is clearly those who choose to follow a religion objecti<b> ng to s</b>exual orientations, that aren't a choice, being portrayed as an acceptable part of life and something that should be respected. They want to teach their children that homosexuality is wrong and lead new generations down the path of intolerance and hate. That's something modern education has a responsibility to fight against.",

Each of these is a well known series of books written to teach children about good and evil and morality and how to live a good life. If you believe you know what is best for children, you should be more familier with the works of J.R.R Tolkien and J.K Rowling which are influential for them. I'm not suggesting you should know all the characters from something like Paw Patrol, these are books that have been around for some time, especially Tolkien's, and everyone with an awareness of the world ought to know they exist and have some idea what they are.",
