As long ago as 2003, the European Court of Justice ruled that EU finance ministers were negligent in allowing France and Germany to continually ignore eurozone GDP deficit rules. Nothing happened. France then breached the 3%\u00a0rule every year from 2008 to 2017. It scraped under at 2.9% last year, but Macron\u2019s capitulation to the gilets jaunes makes it certain that France will break the the rule again next year. France has never been sanctioned nor has Germany. As the FT\u2019s political editor wrote at the time: \"France and Germany won. The message was clear: the European Union has rules, but not everyone has to obey them.\"",

What\u2019s more, they were supported in this action by the UK otherwise known as the country that like to lecture others on fiscal discipline. Gordon Brown was chancellor at the time. So whatever point you're trying to make that took place over 15 years ago in the light of our decision to pursue a ridiculously damaging brexit, and smear the EU, ECJ of dishonesty, it had our uk's full compliance and support right? What matter most is what is happening now, now in 2019, and what safeguards are now in place since that time, which has nothing to do with brexit and should never had influenced your thinking into supporting a leave campaign sold to our uk on a damaging false prospectus. I mean no disrespect but you should have been far more objective instead of subjective in your thinking and research of those events and should have treated them as a separate matter not meriting an abrupt over reactive response in abdicating our european seat and position, throwing our membership in the face of the EU27. So what else have you got to tell everyone here about something happening over a decade &amp; a half ago man?",

For a start, it is the UK, not the EU that is breaking the rules by not nominating a Candidate Commissioner and by breaking the terms of a contract with the EU27. At the moment the UK is in breach of is duty of sincere cooperation and of the prohibition of hindering the functioning of the EU Lisbon article 4 and is violating the extension agreement of 29 October 2019. The outgoing Juncker Commission applies EU law and consequently launched the infringement procedure that may lead to fines for the UK Lisbon Article 258, ex 226 TEC as national government cannot become an obstacle for the functioning of the EU. You seem to think it is unlawful for the EU Commission to convene without a Commissioner from the EU.It isn 't. The Lisbon Treaty article Article 246 permits to maintain a\u00a0posts vacant if a Commissioner leaves before the end of the mandate by resignation, compulsory retirement or death\u00a0I suggest you also read article 17 5 and 7 So, tell us: which law is the EU breaking ?

That's a FTA.Does not cover complex services and still requires customs controls.- Customs Union Trade Agreement if you want to also lift custom controls, you have to enhance your FTA with a <b> common </b>external trade policy.That 's called a customs union trade agreement.\u00a0- Single Market Trade Agreement if you want to freely circulate all four factors of economy goods, services, capital, labour you all have to play by the same rules because services etc are not hindered by tariffs but by differences in regulations.Such a full alignment is required to set up a single market.That 's why there are so many rules: to sustain the free circulation of all four factors of economy. Example When you want to do a FTA with the US, you will have to level with the US rule book to set up a level playing field with the US so that WTO schedules can be lifted. The EU has the following trade deals with non - EU states: -287 bilateral, sectorial and multilateral trade deals - 72 FTAs - 3 customs union trade deals - 4 SM participation trade deals ",

I say to all BREXITEERS if you have NO BP candidate to vote for and your tory candidate is one on my list do NOT vote for them, indeed SPOIL your ballot paper. Some have fled already. Tory MPs who are PRO EU, ANTI UK and ANTI democracy in the UK. The names are: Heidi Allen Guto Bebb Richard Benyon Nick Boles Ken Clarke Jonathan Djanogly Sir Michael Fallon George Freeman Justine Greening Dominic Grieve Sam Gyimah Phillip Le Sir Oliver Letwin Nicky Morgan Robert Neill Antoinette Sandbach Sir Nicholas Soames Anna Soubry Ed Vaizey Sarah Wollaston Philip Hammond. Do NOT vote for any of these who REJECTED DEMOCRACY but stand in THIS one. ",

At the moment the UK is in breach of is duty of sincere cooperation and of hte prohibition of hindering the functioning of the EU.The outgoing Juncker Commission therefore launched the infringement procedure that may lead to fines for the UK. The national governments of all 27 EU member states agreed that the new commission can start, as soon as it wins a vote of confidence in the EU parliamen article 17.5 and 17.7 while article 246 says that a Commission post can remain vacant for a short period under certain conditions. Anyone can indeed challenge the Commission 's decision at the ECJ but everybody is fully confident that the case for starting the Commission with 27 members is legally sound.",

Mr Farage is not unique in his views, and has no monopoly on his views and beleifs regarding leaving the EU. Mr Farage is good at getting publicity for his cause, relieving rich and not so rich people of their money, to advance that cause, because Mr Farage is a politician, and that 's what politicians do. I for one am sick of hearing about Mr Farages express wishes, and I voted No the first time, leave the second time and to paraphrase the odious Bercow creature, \"I don't give a flying flamingo about the gentleman's opinion\" whether it is expressed from  a sedentary position or otherwise. Saint Nigel ran up the white flag on the basis of a proven liars sole tweet. He was either bribed though I doubt it or someone somewhere had leverage on him, in other words he was nobbled. ",
