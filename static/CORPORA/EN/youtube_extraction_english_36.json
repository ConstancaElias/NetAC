Not a video about someone interpreting someones greeting as bigoted,<b>  racist</b>, sexist...etc \n\nBut real events in which you were actually descriminated against that I'm sure was a real eye opener for some.\n\nI particularly enjoyed this because mos<b> t sexis</b>m against men is from other men as well from my experience and I think alot of people need to end the battle of the sexes and look at themselves and what prejudices they have.",

So it's not really reasonable that had her stories been about two sexist men, you'd feel personally attacked. It's ok for anyone to call out <b> sexism </b>as long as they don't attack whole genders over the behavior of individuals. I haven't seen any stories of<b>  sexism</b> on YouTube where all men were attacked so maybe... stop taking such stories about men personally like they're about you or all men.  That's not fair to people with stories of sexist encounters with men. No one should have to hide their story o<b> f sexis</b>m because members of t<b> he gend</b>er it's about will get unreasonably upset.",

I feel for you too on this because I worked at a skate shop and no guy that would come in would ask for my help. I always told them that I've been skating for years but they wouldn't care. It honestly made me super angry... But the best part was younger girls would come in and let me set up boards for them. After any board I would set up I would tell them and their parents to go kick the other boys butts in skating cause they can be better any time any day. thank you for being awesome right away.",

From  what  little  work  I've  done  in  retail,  I  have  run  into  a  few  examples  of  the  north  end  of  a  south  bound  skunk,  but  never  that  blatantly  prejudice.  Come  to  think  of  it  though,  I  did  encounter  something  like  this  from  my  neighbor  once,  directed  at  her  own  granddaughter  of  all  people.  I'm  decently  handy  with  tools,  so  my  neighbor  asks  me  to  help  out  with  a  set  or  eyeglass  screwdrivers.  I  grab  my  set  and  walk  over  to  her  home  and  her  granddaughter  needs  to  swap  out  a  laptop  battery.  Her  granddaughter  is  only  a  couple  years  younger  than  I  am,  and  from  the  few  interactions  we've  had,  she  knew  eons  more  about  computers  than  I  do  and  is  way  more  qualified  to  do  this,  just  lacking  the  tools.  She  goes  to  take  the  screwdriver  set  and  her  grandmother  insists  that  I  do  it  since  I'm  a  guy  and  I  apparently  \"know  about  these  things\",  so  she's  forced  to  sit  there  and  watch  while  I  puzzle  over  how  to  open  this  thing  without  breaking  it  to  replace  the  battery.  I  tried  asking  her  for  help  a  couple  times,  but  it  was  so  <b> weird,</b>  like  her  grandmother  thought  that  if  she  touched  it  it  would  stop  working.  Her  grandmother  wasn't  mean  about  it,  she  just  seemed  oblivious  to  the  situation.",

I played games but wasn't a total expert... but these two employees had fun testing me and when i got the answer wrong when i got the man names from the \"Last of Us\", and they said \"sorry, but we want gaming experts.\" and heard one of them say \"That was fun. But i wouldn't hire her.\" SOOOOOO i have go to an half an hour shop away from the town centre where my local GAME is to shop for games there.",

So mostly, we just wrote notes. :,D (And don't get me started on the granny that lived near me who I was never able to understand. So I would just nod... alot.)",

I often got told on gta back when i got my xbox360 i was like... 12? or 13? and GTA5 was kinda new and it was actually my first game 100% online with people i didn't knew? (i mean... i played a lot of minecraft, perfect dark remaster and other game i was playing online with ONLY friends of mine) but i mean... it was almost the first time i was meeting so much random players and it was kinda scary at this point to join a random chat and having to speak english (considering im french) and like... REALLY OFTEN i was insulted for being the girl of the group? they were asking me to go back in the kitchen or you know... make them a sandwich... or even they called me bad name u knooooooow and anyway... it was feeling really bad for young me trying to have fun and just... learning that apparently, because im a female i was not supposed to play video game? i mean... ok?\n\n\nand in real life i ALSO got a looot of comments from girls? both girls and boys. i mean... everyone kinda have this clich\u00e9 about only boys being sexist but no? at school multiple girls were saying to me that i was going to die alone and that boys doesnt like to date kiddo, they like mature womans? but i was like... WHAT IS THE POINT? XD its not because im a gamer that i am not mature? and i mean... if you actually consider video games being an immature activity, you actually consider that all gamer boys are immature too? so... why as a mature girl i would date an immature boy anyway? better being both immature at this point ;) \n\n\nbut with all that said... this is just really insulting to not be recognized as the person we are in general... i prefer playing video games as a girl and seeing a boy put makeup on than not doing what i really love.",

But cause she looked obviously older than me, people used to think that she was more professional (which was the case by the way but...). Of course she knew more things than me about the products that we were selling, but I remember one time, a client asked me some details about one plant that we were selling, I tried to answer his question and I did quite well, but because I was young and may be I didn't give him the informations with enough self-confidence, he did ask the same question to my mother WHILE I WAS STILL STANDING THERE (and of course she did answer the same as I did hehehe).\n\n\nJust to say that, may be these women weren't trusting you in the first place because you were young (and maybe *then*, because you are <b> a woma</b>n), the other sellers could have looked more reliable because they were older and more professional.",

I go to the shirt section and, basically I don't know anything about the specific sizes male shirt could have(and all the shirts were packed). But the only seller present is a women. First, she looked at me really<b>  weird</b>, then, I asked her what I wanted. She grabbed me an oversized (like XL) ugly shirt for me to \"try their smallest size\". I saw between it a nice, small shirt, plus it was white. I asked: \"And this one, it seems it would fit me perfectly.\" She was looking at me more and more with disgust and I couldn't know why. She said roughly: \"No, try this one.\" Pushed me to the cabins with this horrible thing and made me wear it. I feeled so out of place and humiliated, like I, as a female had no right to buy something here. Plus, she gave me an already unfolded shirt some customer already put on: She didn't wanted to sell me anything in the first place, she didn't wanted to unfold one for me. Long story short, as all the sellers were females here and as I was shy at the time, I leaved. The same situation happened to me in another male store: The female seller was looking at m<b> e weir</b>d, like I shouldn't been here I leaved as quick as I could. In stores were male sellers are present, I was NEVER bothered, they helped me with finding me a fit shirt and been real nice to me.",

Maybe if you did more saving than consuming then you'd actually have a concept of value instead of just asserting everything is way too expensive when you're just a cheapskate who want's free access to luxury goods. Literally it was about 2 decades ago when a Microwave was considered an expensive luxury good instead of a necessity. If you want cheaper housing then buy a cheaper house, if you want better pay then take jobs with higher risk that require more labor, if you want affordable healthcare then accept that they can't supply you with free shit for a lower price, God's sake UNDERSTAND VALUE!",

So there were these female employees walking around and their outfit for just this week was a skirt, instead of pants, and the regular t-shirt and the employee wanted to help this couple that was standing across from us and the mom just cut her off from the beginning and said \"Look, we need real help from a guy and not from some slut that was hired to look pretty.\" So the employee was pissed and her boss overheard it and just started yelling at this lady saying things like she isn't a slut and who are you to judge she knows more about washing machines (we were standing at the washing machines) then most of the guys in this store so please leave immediatly. The employee then helped us out, but me and my dad were just a bit in shock and started to apologise but we didn't even know why but that lady was just so awful. Also the couple later tried to enter the store but got sent out immediatly by the boss who send them out earlier which was pretty funny to see.",

Looking at one of you girls the wrong way is supposedly<b>  sexism</b>, while you can get away with almost anything<b> ! Nobod</b>y takes charges <b> of sexu</b>al harassment seriously, if the harasser i<b> s a wo</b>man and the victim a boy or a man!\n\nEDIT: Ok, I agree that that is sexist - but then again if you don't confront that ASAP (cause a scene if you have to, letting others disrespect you is never good! You have a right to be treated normally!)...still, don't you think the same wouldn't happen if a guy worked in a clothing store? Women probably would think he doesn't know his way around clothing (especiall their clothing!) and they'd look for a female shop-assisstant!\n\nAs for \"toxic masculinity\" no, such a thing doesn't exist! Toxic PEOPLE (be they male or female!) do exist, but an en<b> tire ge</b>nder is not toxic! It's the same if I accused all women of being bitchy and bossy and being bitchy on steroids when PMSing, but most women - thank god (damned, need another way to say this...saying: Thank god as an athei<b> st is </b>weird!) - have that under control! They might not actually appologize if they were a bit more on edge around their period, but they also normally don't take it out on you either! So stop saying this, please!",

I've had the \"Where are the games for girls?\" and a female customer say \"Games aren't ladylike\". Way, way more sexist comments from women for sure. \n\nOne of my colleagues had been trying to answer a question about a game to a male customer and he completely ignored her and tried to get the answer from one of our male colleagues who simply turned to her and said loudly \"Hey (Name), does your vagina get in the way when you're playing games?\" \n\nThe worst thing a manager has ever said (from another branch) is that they hire attractive girls, even if they don't know anything about games because \"You can teach people games, but you can't teach charisma.\"",

He has some prior experience in retail, he has a good way of wording things, speaks clearly and came in looking put together and freshly bathed. \nSo I have him fairly high on my list of new hires. I thank him for coming in, since i have a few more interviews and several possitions to fill I will be in contact by the end of the week. \nHe should have said thanks and left, he would have had the job. \nInstead he starts telling ne what I should do, and ends with \"Well, I wouldn't expect much from <b> a woma</b>n, its why they should have had a man doing this\" \nI crossed him off my list and tell him to leave. \nDude had the nerve to complain to Higher ups that I was the sexist one. \nthe only other time, I was working the floor, filling in (it was a seriously bad time for my stores, we lost alot of people, the company made some horrible calls.. i was doing some serious overtime) when i see thing young man debating the xbox game line up, so I ask if he needs anything and he responds \n\"Yeah, Someone who will actually know about games. not some girl\" \nnext to me was actually another costumer, a teenage girl who looked ready to blow up herself. \nI was going to have a fight on my hands. I had several options, either hand him over to one of my other employees to deal with (most in this shop WERE girls) toss him out, smile and deal with it. \nI. Did. None. Of. This. \nI smiled brightly and slapped my hands on my face and went \"OMG!  I didn't think you actually existed!\" \nNow, the girl beside me looks confused, thd young man looks confused and nearby I hear one of my employees snort cause they know me. \nhe says \"What?\" \nI indicated him \"A fake gamer boy! Boys who still think girls don't play games. I thought you were just legend, like bigfoot or unicorns\" \nThe girl cracks up, the guy go<b> es <b> r</b</b>>ed and says \"I want to speak to your manager!\" \n\"Unless you want my district manager, I'm regional, how may I help you?\" I don't think I could have grinned any wider.. \nMoments like this I suddenly realize how right my friends are when they call me evil...\nhe turned purple and left.",

It was always the girls being judgy and acting like I didn't know about computers when they had an issue. My co-workers were mostly men and treated me like a competent human being. Some of the guys were a little hesitant but I think that had more to do with not being comfortable talking to a girl rather than being sexist.",

But then, all of my friends to this day will call me for advice on animal husbandry. Sure I DO have a lot of experience with animals, but it seems both men and women are more likely to ask me about medical or other \"soft\" questions and very few ever call me up to ask about engineering stuff even though that is MY FRIKKEN DEGREE!\n\nExcept for<b>  my elde</b>rly neighbors.

I was shocked but politely replied 'Ahh well sorry I interrupted but *Mark is new here and he's not fully trained on this product yet' and Mark backed me up and said 'Yeah sorry she knows way more than me on this!' and she just looked me up and down and said 'Oh. Okay then. Well thanks but I think i'll have to come back with my husband'.... Which baffled me. Why didn't she give me a chance? Why did she need her husband now?

I couldn't work out what advantage the more expensive one had over the pack of two batteries so I went to ask the staff for some advice. There was a guy and girl at the till, I would have preferred to have spoken to the girl but she was busy so i went up to the guy and asked what was the difference between the packs. He stood there for about two minutes just reading the back of the boxes (something which i'd already done) and gave me an incorrect answer saying that the cheaper batteries could hold charge for 3 hours. The back of the box didn't say anything about holding time, it instead said it had a 3 hour charging time. The girl finished with her customer and offered her assistance and once i told her what i was confused about she immediately told me that the single battery was more expensive simply because of aesthetics and i'd be better off buying the pack of two batteries.",

He started with the boys first since there is 14 boys in my class and only six girls. When he got to the girls, only half of us wanted to do sports. This one kid was like 'girls don't do sports, they just cook and do chores'. Everyone in my class told him that was sexist and wrong while the teacher told him to shut his mouth.",

It's mainly a generational thing but it's also a problem with people from certain countries or people who have a traditionalist family who have held onto the prejudices and preconceptions. As the decades go on it gets better but hasn't died out yet like other things have yet. I'm mean there are still racists who believe <b> black </b>people are less intelligent. In the end there are still people who will believe this prejudice bullshit. \n\nI also kind of feel sorry for those women as it means they don't think highly enough about there<b>  sex</b> o<b> r gende</b>r to believe that they to can understand what some people call boy stuff. Even though back when game consoles were coming out they were pitched to the whole family. It was only the video game crash that forced companies to target children and then they only had the money to tragedy either boys or girls. In the end they chose boys. So in another world the games industry could have easily chosen girls as the target market for games consoles.",

The reason why less women are interested in software development is that society tells them that women shouldn't be interested in software development. <b> Common </b>stereotypes influence people's choices.\nAlso IQ as a measurement of intelligence is basically meaningless. It was invented to determine whether school children were ready to graduate to another class. The reason why it became as big as it got was that people just like the thought of an objective measurement for intelligence existing. The only thing that it tells you is that you are better or worse at solving the specific problems featured in the IQ-test.",

He said 'I bet Wonder<b>  Woman</b> is your favourite superhero, because she's a girl' I said 'actually, I really like Spider-Man an<b> d Blac</b>k Panther, but the Wond<b> er Wom</b>an movie might be my favourite movie because of the amazing representation, although the representation<b>  in Bl</b>ack Panther is really good too.' He just goes 'I don't like it when a character is a girl and it makes no sense' so my girlfriend and I just hesitantly asked 'when does it not make sense?' He lists off a bunch of super masculine, punch first, talk later characters and said 'it wouldn't make sense if they were girls' I said 'actually, that would be awesome' I won't go into it too much more, but he didn't let us get a single word in\n\n\n\n\n\nLike I said, I'm not friends with him anymore, I won't go into it, but was just causing me stress, and he was starting to get really offensive all the time",

After listening to the student's request, which was something incredibly simple like a password change or something else we did dozens of times a day without thinking, Hero told the student: 'That's a pretty technical issue and I think Laura should deal with it as she has more skills and experience than me.'

You are the same person, only the customer changes. Armed with \"what you know\" you take arsehole customers in your stride and after a while they barely bother you (well unless they are being aggressive). There comes a time when you can play them like a fiddle because they are so predictable and you can just push their buttons and sit and enjoy the spectacle you just made themselves turn into. If you work in retail and EVERYONE pisses you off, get another job. Customer focus isn't ever going to work for you. If you are getting a real sense of enjoyment in helping people, you are doing everything pretty much right. I'd still be doing it but the unsocial hours and salary sucked.",

But I think it's because I mostly play fantasy MMOs or RPGs and I find that when I go over to playing FPS games like CoD or CS I find more who are the stereotypical \"gamer-girl\" which I find quite interesting. Think it's because those games generally have a younger audience because those that grind fantasy RPGs are most likely to be hardcore fans of Tolkien and maybe even classic horror which probably makes it harder to find thirsty guys lol.\n\nBtw I'm sorry if my grammar is off (english is my third language) and this comment is not supposted to be negatively directed at the girl in the video.",

I remember going back to school and in one of my lessons there was this boy telling everyone about how he got a Switch for Christmas so I went over and said 'oh you play on Switch?' and he said yes and started explaining what a Switch WAS! I told him I knew what a Switch was and maybe he could add me, but because he was sexist he said something along the lines of 'wait you play Switch? Wow' I asked why he said wow and I don't remember exactly what he said but it was something to do with him thinking I'd be more interested in makeup than game consoles and that really pissed me off and I ended up ignoring him for about a week",

But this is the issue. It's mothers who tell their daughters not to play games, because it's a thing for boys.\n\nAgain, amazing video. Great representation.",

The 2 people weren't actually (I hate using this term) \"gamers.\" a mum and a grand parent. probably the reason that they thought that \"girls can't be gamers\" is because that's the stereotype. That gamers a all sweaty manchildern living in there parents basement and not just regular people with a hobby. and while there are people who do fit the stereotype but it isn't everyone. But when someone is getting a game for there kids they don't think that someone who is so far from the stereotype is going to know anything about it and it sucks that people think that way. but Luckily as more people start to play game hope fully things will change for the better. And I mean it's <b> nothing </b>compared to the pain people who have to suffer through people being<b>  racist</b> or sexist or homofobic to them on a daily basis.",

It was a \"man's job.\" She purposely ignored her job to wait for person with a different genitalia to do her job for her. Also she was signed up to stack ice but it was too unpleasantly cold, heavy, and dangerous so she waited for me or my other guy coworker to do it for her. Because it's \"men's work.\" She was even more taller than me so I don't see how I could stack higher. There is more examples but gosh was she the worst.\nI eventually talked to my boss about it and I wish I did earlier. I didn't had to pick up her slack anymore after that.\nLadies and gents don't be afraid of confrontation if you are being treated unfairly. Go to your boss and try to explain.",

No- No thank you'\nAnd as I was walking towards the BOY section (I usually go to the boy section since I like the hoodies etc there +I'm none binary)\n\nThis lady decides to grab my arm with my mother rushing after me! I was trying to get out of her grip but she straight up borrowed me! \n\nThen she stopped by a pink fluffy jacket and smiled at me\n'This is where you should go!' \n\nMy mother then gave her a glare and we went on trying to find that one hoodie. We didn't see her again when we were in that shop.",

Seems I've been given the wrong number\"\nMe: \"No sorry\"\nHer: \"Can't you google it!?\"\nMe: \"No sorry, I am at my place of work, can you not google it?\"\nHer: \"I don't have a stupid computer, I need to make a call to Tesco Butcher as they haven't delivered my turkey!!\"\nMe: \"Ok.....Well I hope you get that sorted, sorry I couldn't be more help, take care\"\nHer: \"<b> Fat </b>lot of good you were, goodbye hangs up \"\n\nGot tons of other stories as well :') if I could animate I'd do something like this but alas I suck at that sort of stuff.",

I can't walk into EB Games without \"CAN I HELP YOU FIND ANYTHING?! ^_^\" from one of the girls (I almost never see guys in there, not for a good 10 years, they were informative, but dicks). It's to the point where I'll try to go in, try to locate one of them in my peripheral (so as to not make eye contact), and try to just go about my businesses (literally just checking prices, titles, reading backs of games, sometimes looking them up on metacritic and reading reviews too, I like to be informed, I only spend 5-10 mins in the store if I'm buying for myself). But no. Every single time I get someone approach me, it's just a matter if it'll be instantly or about a minute after I'm in.\n\nSounds like it could be fine, right? Ask them for details on the games? Not a chance, at most they know 3 hit games, and that's it. So if I already own a couple of those games, and maybe I don't want the other, they can't help me with the 40 other possible games on the shelf anyways, so it's just a waste of time for everyone involved. If someone's looking at a game, and you can't even tell them how many players it has then maaaybbbeee leave that customer alone until they're looking at a game you know.\n\nI can't hate on all the stores though, just my local one. They used to have one girl who seemed informed, but after blatantly lying to me about a product, I didn't trust her anymore (I also didn't see her there a month later, so she probably did it to a few people, probably being stressed out by the job, and I'm assuming quit). And then after a dude in another city was useless with helping me with the Switch, the girls helped me find everything I wanted, and knew everything about everything I wanted lol.\n\nPeople need to realize that in game stores, some people won't care about their job, some people go in because they love games. Male or female, doesn't really matter, it's majorly a demographic of people who apply because they're at least somewhat interested in what's being sold. Sorry to write a whole story here, I was just shocked at how people treated there because you're a girl. In the context of game stores, I actually never considered that older people might not quite understand how different our generation is.",

Saw this appear up when I went to your channel and paused it for a moment going like \"Great... a creative youtuber who for a moment I liked and might just be another feminist \"games are sexist\" person.\" Note I said might. Because I am not so closed minded and petty as to see such a thing and run away, but instead said \"Let me see what this is about!\"\n\nBut you were talking about actual, legitimate sexist beliefs held by people who treated you terribly. I want to say my apologies that you, a great young mind, were ever mistreated in such a way as well as apologize for thinking you might do such a thing as post like the stereotypical \"feminist gamer\" just from seeing the video name. Never judge a book by its cover. Here in Texas, these things are well-known. Sadly with the current migration of people evading their own terribly chosen political stances wrecking their own economy from a particularly blue state though we are beginning to be overrun by legitimate sexists and racists. I guess these things will sadly be expect-able soon even for me.\n\nI want to say that this was indeed a superb video, I enjoy the way you introduce things and how you come off. Your art style is fun and playful, simple yet attractive.",

            "commentText": "I think my fav story in my experience as a women gamer was when I went to best buy to purchase i new gaming keyboard. I had researched what I wanted and their site said they had stock so i went after work to get it. IMMEDIATELY several empolyees were like \"WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?\" and I was like I just wanna grab a keyboard. So they \"hand me off\" to a man who is in the keyboard section and he goes: \" So... you were told to get a keyboard; do you have any more information?\" and he was in front of me, leading the way, and I did probably the most \"WTF\" face of my life. So i respond with \"Well, I prefer my keyboards to have backlighting and mechanical switches, cherry reds preferably but not Razer brand\" AND HE SPUN AROUND SO FAST I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA BREAK HIS SPINE. Then he completely swapped gears and was like \"Oh yeah we have lots like that, blah blah\" and I immediately pick up the one I researched and he's like \"Already know what you want eh?\" *nervous energy intensifies*, \"Yup! Thanks, have a great day!\"",

            "commentText": "Wow, this is so accurate it's painful. I work at the biggest chain of game stores we have in the Netherlands and Belgium, and I deal with this on a daily basis. Customers (male and female) who act totally surprised when I go into detail about the mechanics of a game. \"Oh, you actually play games?\" Well yes, they wouldn't have hired me otherwise... Or customers who completely bypass me and walk straight to my male colleagues (I'm the only girl in my team). Luckily I have amazing colleagues who can get just as worked up about this as I can, and they often put the offending customer in their place by saying \"oh I'm sorry I happen to know <b> nothing </b>about this game, but my colleague here can help you out.\" or \"She's the expert on Xbox, let me ask her.\" but I'm sure not everyone is that lucky. I am proud to say that the ratio of men and women working at our stores is heading towards 50/50 and I hope that in the long run that will make people see that girls are equal in every way to guys, also in the video game world. Thanks for making this video, I'm definitely gonna share this!",

I know there are women out there who are considered 'a <b> woman'</b>s<b>  woman</b>' and they tend to not know much about gaming or systems or what the little boy is talking about. And that's fine. If you are <b> a woma</b>n and don't understand games in any real depth, that is totally fine. But just because you're like that, that doesn't mean you get to assume eve<b> ry wom</b>an is like that. That is just not okay. It's rude and sexist. If you ar<b> e a wo</b>man and realize you do this, please recognize wh<b> en a w</b>oman is actually being competent about these things. It's very rude when you ign<b> ore a </b>woman for trying and what would have been succeeding to help you if you had just looked at her and thanked her for being so nice to put up with your previously rude behavior.",

I used to work in a store called CEX which sells mostly second hand games and electronics and also had a few encounters where customers wanted me to get a male co-worker to help them (UGH!) Especially the part of the lady with the kid cutting the line! ARGH so many people did this and it was so annoying! Never the less I had an awesome few years working there and a lot of girls were happy having a girl helping them as I was the only female worker there at the time but my god this video felt so relatable!",

I got a lot of crap for being active in male dominated sports such as competitive weight lifting (it's a big thing where I live), but not from the dudes. The dudes thought it was hella dope I could keep up with them. Nope, the people correcting me were mostly women asking me XYZ about whether I was concerned about appearing masculine, telling me to pick a more feminine sport, and those just straight up refusing to believe a girl could lift weights without toppling over and begging for help like the women of Victorian times.\n\nSide note: the majority of women I dealt with were in their thirties or older. The women around m<b> y ag</b>e were mostly hella supportive that I rocked that sport. Just an important note I thought I'd add",

I worked at Gamestop in the US for 8 years and managed one for 5 of those years, and I saw this with my female employees way to often, and yes while we did get some sexist men, honestly it was mostly older women and moms who were down right rude and sexist to them. I could not believe it, so when they would come ask me the same question they had just gotten their answer to I would deliberately redirect them and point out that my employee was correct and she can grab that thing you want. Obviously if the employee did not want to deal with that individual anymore I wouldn't make them, but they usually enjoyed having a smug look of satisfaction when they still got the numbers and got to make the person look like a jerk.",

Thanks, Kyle, thanks Tanner, you guys are the coolest!)\n\nAs odd as this seemed, none of the people I interacted with judged me that way, but I have seen it before...but instead of a female being put down, but being placed up above because she was a female gamer. Thankfully, all of the staff at my local Gamestops are very levelheaded and are great conversationalists (seriously, you'll be talking all day!) and treat everyone as equals. The only ones they don't seem to get is the parents that let little Timmy buy GTA 5. Them and close-minded people who are so sure of their \"research\" that they are right and the staff is wrong.\n\nI am sorry those two women were uber nasty to treat you like that. It's fascinating that older women seem to think ONLY men seem to know all about video games. It must be a generation thing...or didn't play as kids themselves.\n\nIf a <b> woman </b>shows interest out of the norm of the fashion world, makeup tutorials, or doesn't mind blood or dirt on their knees, the women who ARE in that stereotype<b>  gender</b> role look down at her because \"she's not one of us.\" It's high school cattiness. Even in the Navy, I faced this, because I was that one female that LOVED all things video games and dirty jokes and aking the boys laugh. The women spread constant rumors about me because I wasn't one of them. Thankfully, I had my nerdy guy friends to keep me up when I needed it, but it still hurt. And to top it off, all of these women were M<b> Y ag</b>e! Not older! It's very hurtful that we women are not...tolerable of other personalities within o<b> ur gend</b>er.\n\nI'm not a girly-girl, but if someone is, I don't hate them (maybe be a bit stand-offish because<b>  my tom</b>boy personality WILL clash with it, but will try to be nice). It really does suck that we as females CAN'T seem to get along and are within cliches in our<b>  own ge</b>nder.\n\nHell, if you are a girly-girl, fashion police, makeup artist, live-for-gossip, or totally tomboyish, I won't hate... but, if you hate on ME, then I do~ Simple as that.",

And then there's my aunt, she would forbid my mom to get me games because \"girls aren't or shouldn't be interested in a thing for boys\" so she'd have to smuggle them into the room her and I lived in. I got grounded several times when my oldest cousin (I was older than him but sTILL) would find the games and tell then show his mom, and she'd tell my mom she's \"ruining me by raising me to be a man\".

Everytime I'd call about a preorder and a <b> woman </b>picked up for a, \"Mr Male Sir Man,\" they'd BERATE me for calling! \"Who are you, whore!?\" They'd go off on a tangent thinking I'm some hussy from a corner that their whipped manbaby gave his number to. Absolutely ridiculous. Moms are the worst though. It was usually just me and my manager, who incidentally was a stripper for a while, and they'd always ask to talk to a man. We'd just point them to any man in their life who has the hobby, and they'd gawk, \"they let ladies work here ALONE!?\" it's so good. I love women in game stores, they're a riot.\n\n\nEDIT: also I remember one time this women came in carrying a bunch of games and a very rare<b>  re<b> d</b</b>> wii, I think? She stole them from her, \"cheating piece of shit\" boyfriend and tried to do a trade in for around $50. She could get around $200 online for the wii but refused, she just wanted to trade in his shit, didn't care about money. We said we can't do that, now that she's admitted to theft, and she tried to get us to SYMPATHIZE, \"you know men, it's just us girls,\" etc. like holy sh<b> it wom</b>an, get out! We had to call the cops. \n\nA lot of moms try this too when they bring in their adult child's games, \"men don't need these after 18,\" nah lady that's not your shit in that small sandwich baggie, and even if I typed in all titles and entered them for trade in (by HAND because they don't know what CASES are) you'd get like.... a dollar.\" ... \"But these were $40-60 when I got them!!!!\" yeah, well, no one wants to <b> buy </b>old scratched up Maddens for more than five bucks.",

For me it's men most of the time who are skeptical about my knowledge and skills. It used to bother me, like \"what is wrong with you, I'm capable and you would see that, if only you cared to listen\". Today I'm like \"*shrug* Well, go on your way, then, I see you don't want help on the spot. Your problem, not mine.\" I've also had young guys fret over the fact that I know certain things they don't, because they're men and a girl shouldn't know better than them. This feeling can also magnify significantly with a girlfriend standing next to them. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 Well, these things happen, but you get to brush them off after a while. \ud83d\ude09",

Anyways, we had a special promotion one month that involved the XBOX 1 or maybe it was the S, can't remember now.. anyways, at this point I had just been promoted to manager, so I didn't get to interact with customers anymore unless it was a concern, however I happened to be walking by a register when a <b> woman </b>and her son were asking the (FEMALE) cashier questions on how to win, how to compete to win the XBOX 1, however.. as soon as i walked by I noticed the<b>  woman</b> look at me like I was a Knight in shining armor, and immediately I heard \"Oh I want to talk to HIM.\" and she pointed at me, now I'm not one to turn a down a customer.. however not only did I find this rude, as she dismissed my employees knowledge but she essentiall<b> y gende</b>r sniped me. She even actually said \"You look like the nerdy type, you should be the one talking to people about this\" I was honestly kind've breathtaken, considering I actually don't know about XBOXs. I'm a PC gamer, always have been! I owned a PS4 once. that was it. I immediately explained to t<b> he wom</b>an that I didn't know anything about XBOX as I played computer games, and she said \"Oh that doesn't matter, you're still smarter on the subject than some\" again, this was just.. wow. The cashier tried explaining she actually owned the Xbox 1 and <b> the wo</b>man straight up said \"I didn't ask for your input i asked for his, he knows what I'm talking about.\" It was.. quite the opposite. I didn't knowing anything other than what I was trained to say on the XBOX 1 promotion, this cashier girl knew everything considering she owned one. Needless to say I told the customer I was sorry, and that if she couldn't listen to the cashier then no one here could help her better. She was fairly angry and left. Whoops.",

Women, by nature, are more emotional. They get offended more easily, they're more envious and petty and overreact way more than men. Which naturally leads them to be more prone to crying over things way more often than men. Ever seen a dude cry over literally everything? No because it's <b> weird </b>and unnecessary. Not to say men aren't allowed to cry because all humans cry, naturally anyone with<b>  common</b> sense would acknowledge this. But you seem to think people actually believe men can't cry, how logical. If need be and a man happens to find himself in an awfully tragic situation, then he'll cry. Like if he loses a relative. A true man can feel manly but still acknowledge his emotions and cry every so often. Crying all the time and overreacting about everything is a reall<b> y siss</b>y thing to do tho, and such behaviour should not be encouraged.",

                    "commentText": "@l u c k y I've read a lot of your comments across different videos and I don't usually read comments.\n\n\nLet's first just straighten this about feminists. If you live in places like America, the UK or Australia, you are, by default, going to be a feminist. I know you're emotional over it, but I don't actually think you're against equality. \n\n\nNext. I have never seen nor heard nor would subscribe to this 'feminist movement' that gets your goat so terribly. I also don't subscribe to UFO conspiracy movements either. Those people are obnoxious, <b> weird </b>and a margin minority compared to anyone else on this planet. The rest of us breathes a sigh of relief. We are in fact agreeing with you.\n\n\nWhen you want to rebut a comment about the 'pay gap' you might want to 1. Consider that they may in fact have an actual pay gap in their country.\n2. Check what they're actually talking about. Someone may simply be commenting on the fact that they checked out a census graph about working people and added up the part time and full time together to get to their conclusion. A political rant isn't really an appropriate response and neither is saying it's fantasy. It exists, and there's not much to do about it.\n\n\nThere are legitimate reasons in life, living and psyche, that across the full census demographics in an equal pay society ends up with 'women' ultimately getting paid less than 'men',  yes. Yes. YES-BUT:\n\n\n1. Can anybody fix it by complaining? No. Whinging? Eh, if it makes them feel better. They're not hurting anyone.\n2. Can anybody improve it by sticking up for themselves and considering their self worth a bit more? \nSure, some cases. I'm guilty. I never walked into my manager's office directly asking for a pay rise. Sure that's evidence that I have an arrogant superiority complex over men right there. -_-\nI remember my first job; I worked up this huge logical debate before I went in just asking for extra hours. Who knows how many people could actually get a pay rise in their position if only they had the balls to do it but 'eh, it's okay... I don't want to put strain on the finances. I could just go find another company who pays more outright instead if I really wanted'. (Notice I said 'people' there. My memory tells me you're going to miss it in favour of being emotional about the fact that there are bound to be some men in this pit as well.) \nIn other cases, no. My mum asked for help in her job after it literally wrecked her arm and got yelled at by her manager for being too weak for the job. When she quit they replaced her with two men, not one. My mum was doing the work of two men with a damaged arm and it was her that was weak. Sure that's evidence that my mum has an arrogant superiority complex over men right there. -_-\n\n3. Now, blanket stating because I didn't do the whole detail backtracking here, (care factor 2/10) but 'the rest of the cases' are basically lifestyle choices. It's well and sob arrogant for the rest of us (M+F) to look down at a census graph and go, 'hey, you're wrecking Australia's equality look! Go dump your two toddlers in highly expensive daycare and get a job to pay for someone else to raise your kids while they're still in their informative stage you worthless no good<b>  bum</b> of a single mother.'\n\n\n\nAs for women being selfish, well, I just told you a couple real stories where that's not a factor, so, do you mind and quit villianising a whole demographic because of some minority Ahole extremists. I appreciate extremism goes for a healthy debate (and who doesn't love Maleficent) but it's not great when you start classifying all females as extremists and dis-include yourself from the category you fall into. You live in a democratic country where women vote and you don't even have a problem with them getting 'equal pay'.\n\n\nI love you really. Not everything you've said annoys me.\nMy vague notion of you suggests you're no<b> t g<b> a</b</b>>y. May I suggest logically reconsidering it? In My Asexual Opinion, you might be suffering undue pressure to 'like women' for 'a particular reason'. I feel you. I have Eminem CDs (way back when CDs were a thing) and they're all subtitled with 'you don't want no bf because your standards are fn2 high'.\n\n\nPlease chill. Give it a break. N'I'll probably meet you again in another few months and reiterate like Jafar's parrot again. Oh. btw my arrogance. I'm an Australian and I'm <b> too </b>old to know any less.",

                    "commentText": "@VAPX007 \nIt is not a feminist thing to just think equality should be the norm. This was established decades ago. There are many people who believe an obtrusive hierarchy is annoying, I refuse to be lumped into the feminist category just because I believe what most normal people believe. To say that the only possible way for you to want everyone to just get along normally is to be a feminist, is absolutely ridiculous. And what actually defines a feminist, do explain, because the meaning seems to vary these days. A feminist could be someone who wants female supremacy, a feminist could be someone who's pro choice, a feminist could be someone who wants women to be treated like men, it goes on.\n\nQuite frankly, when I mention how nonexistent the pay gap is I am, most obviously, referring to the West. And since I'm writing in English and getting replied to in English, you would assume the people I'm talking with are Western folk as well. It's <b> common </b>sense really...although there may be the odd bunch that are foreign. Feminism is mostly a problem in the West, it's not so extravagant in other countries...so wouldn't you assume that I'm referring to the West? Come on now I know you're not that dense.\n\nAnd look sorry about your mum, but her being weak isn't really an attack on her for being a<b>  woman</b>. Have you considered that maybe her boss thought she was weak as a person and not just as <b> a woma</b>n? Or maybe he just didn't like her? Don't you think it's a bit sexist to assume she was labelled weak due to h<b> er gend</b>er, <b> and gen</b>der alone? \nAnd regarding my sexuality? Although I find it awfully strange of you to mention it, I am indeed straight. I don't see how I could reconsider liking women in that way tho, I thought people were <b> bor<b> n</b</b>> gay? Also I don't really know what you're getting at with those Eminem CDs...I'm glad you enjoy his music?",

Just let me look for a little bit and then come ask me. Especially in a store as small as LUSH can be. And the fact that generally one LUSH employee will ask if you need help, you'd think the others leave you alone for the most part but generally I'll have left the store and every person in that store tried to help me. I do appreciate their service, but as an introvert it makes me really consider whether or not I even want to enter the store or just try my luck ordering online.",

I had a female manager during a paid internship and she was passing around dry erase markers (different colors so we knew who wrote what) and all the male interns got to pick whatever color marker they wanted but because I'm a women I had to pick either pink or purple. She went on to get on me about how I had to wear dresses (even though in the dress code it said you could wear formal pants and literally no other manager ever had a problem if I wore pants) and how as a women I shouldn't rest my elbows on the desk like the men cause it was \u2018unsightly' and so on. And at my regular job I had an older women ask me why I was the one moving heavy boxes around and if there was a man around to do it because I'd be \u2018better off in the kitchen preparing lunch'. \nNot to say I haven't ever had issues with men, but the issues I've had with men weren't sexist issues. (No, the problems I've had with men usually involved getting in my face and yelling at me, or locking me in a closet (long story), or just wasting my time so I couldn't finish whatever task I had started in the first place).",

By my third year I was lucky that some of my teachers were fed up with it too and try to make it stop to little success, but when we got a new history teacher he shut it down on the spot in his very first lesson.

So I worked in Debenhams and I was employed to work in fragrance but was typically moved around different till areas etc. So one day I was on the busiest till and an older guy comes up with who I presume was his wife and they're buying full length jumpsuits. So trying to get these customers served quickly I folded their stuff up but as doing so the guy was making comments like \"God can she not fold those better\" \"A child could fold this better\" I was really angry and due to my anxiety I felt sick too but I just went through with the transaction not saying anything but ofc I forget to remove a security tag on one of the items. So another girl comes of bringing them with her and once again he insults how they're folded. I believe he said something about girls being incapable too which urgh. But over this happening my manager overheard and spoke to the man and guess what. HE BULLSHITTED ME TALKING TO MY COWORKER! Yep, he claimed I was rude and spoke to my coworker the entire time. I was so pissed off fucking jumpsuits are so difficult to fold, cunt",

In fact, now I think about it, a lot of blokes would ridicule me for playing them sometimes as well, naming it geeky. Now it's unusual for anyone (Millennial and younger) not to be playing them and playing with women on games is proper cool. \n\nLast time I was in Game, buying one of the new blockbusters, as I was buying it at the counter, being served by a younger lady, I was blown away by her knowledge and passion for the game and it's genre. I guess my surprise meant I have an archaic sexist attitude towards gaming (sorry about that), perhaps fostered in my upbringing in the 90's, but the fact that I wanted to marry her at the end of her opinion hopefully means it was just a learning curve lol. She looked about 20 though so way to young for me lol.",

Being a female who knows computers intimately enough to build my own, I would say I know well enough to help anyone pick a computer that is right for them. For some reason though I get quite a few customers who, when I ask them if I can help them find something, they gloss over me, tell me know, then turn around not even a minute later and ask one of my male co-workers where they could find what they were looking for. Needless to say it frustrates me to no end. Apparently having boobs qualifies me as brain dead about technology :D",

If you're over 35, you'll probably think it's strange that women are getting into positions that men mostly occupied during their upbringing. It's a natural but slow process that can make certain people impatient (like SJWs, who are people that I personally find annoying). I'm sorry that happened to you and hope that you don't have to deal with this problem TOO much. :/",

Me and my brother head into our local GameStop, I want to preorder SCV, and my brother just wants to know what the upcoming games are. So I walk up to the registers(because it was dead silent), and my brother follows because the list for the new games is there. a clerk makes his way over to the registers and goes through the store shpeal. I guess we startled him, and he didn't realize anyone was in the store. So i just tell him I'm interested in pre-ordering the new soul caliber game on xbox 360. and the clerk turns his head to my brother and goes \"Yeah the game is really great. I love the graphics and combo styles for the new characters.\" and my brother just smiles and nods, and I add \"I hope they still have my favorites like Talim,Tika and Mitsu\" the clerk glaces over and goes \"they're in it.\" and starts asking my brother his favorite character. He looks over to me and goes \"who's the one with the rapier?\" and the clerk butts in and goes \"Oh! Raphael! He's pretty nice.\" and my brother just look at the clerk and goes \"I dont really play the game much, my sister loves it though.\" and the clerk turns <b> red<b>  </b</b>>like a beet and rings up my preorder and we both walk out.",

I asked a stupid little teenage guy if they had anymore and he said \"Oh, those are limited edition\" I'm like, \"Okay. Yes, do you have anymore in the back since the cabinet is empty?\" And he again stated that they are limited edition and started to explain to me what \"limited edition\" was. I'm getting pissed off like \"What the heck?? I KNOW what \"limited edition\" means, do you have anymore?\" And then when he tries to say \"No, they're limited edition\" I've had enough and went to a different, slightly older teenage guy and asked him if they had more. He was super nice and went to the back. He found 2 boxes with 3 in each! He even took the one I want to the front for me to put on layaway. I was so pissed at the one moron who I guess seemed to think I was a moron who didn't know what limited edition meant? But thank God the good worker actually helped me. People are ridiculous.",

It's sickkkkkening. I hated it. Thank god I only had to do it sparingly, but even then. Holy shit was it awkward for me and everyone coming in. Fecking hate it.

You even have to answer the phone with some garbage about pre ordering some games before saying \"can I help you\".  As for the lady and her son, She was probably annoyed that you couldn't understand her son. Saying lets talk to one of the men could easily be the easiest way of saying \"anyone else in this store\" as you were probably the only female. The <b> old </b>guys wife probably doesn't like her husband talking to young ladies. I worked there for five years, my manager and assistant manager were female, my now wife worked with me there. She saw no sign of what your talking about. Christmas shopping customers were the worst, they are stressed with crowds, don't have any patience and will always try to be insulting. Like you say, the staff are fantastic, it was like a small family.  Working in a shop would be great if it wasn't for customers. If that kid had a swnsea accent then you were probably in a store near me, i worked in bath, bristol and cardiff.",

End of statement. \n\nThat being the case, would my intervention be appreciated or cause further upset? \n\nI know if ask ten people (or the entire internet as in this case) I'm going to get ten different answers but it would be interesting to know.\n\nAlso the lady with the young boy: This annoys the crap out of me... I'm trying my best to take a real hard look at any of my own incorrect attitudes and make sure I'm being fair to everyone I meet, largely because I have two daughters and I don't want them to grow up with anything but confidence that they can succeed in any endeavour they should try. And here is a lady ensuring that her son probably won't give my daughters the respect they deserve simply because they are women, or will be women....you know what mean. Grr! \n\n\nThanks",

I mean, those are actual human beings, not some doll you can just drag around however you like. If you don't like dealing with people that want to make their own decisions, horrible video mom (and whoever else may not know that), maybe don't have kids.",

We're raised with this plan in mind \"finish school, get a job, get married, have children\" or something similar and we're just led to believe that that's the only thing that matters and that will make us happy so many people don't even really think about it. They just blindly follow the steps without, well, turning on their brain and wondering if that's really what they want.\nAnd I' sorry, it's awfully cliche to say, but we are a bit like cattle in that respect.\nNot that I'm saying that something is wrong if you WANT to do things that way, but I feel like people often don't really want to do things this way and just do it because everyone else does it which is a really horrible reason to be doing something, especially if it affects others (like said children these people will make).\n\nMaybe some do it because they want to feel powerful, but maybe some  also do it because they blindly followed the plan and now feel like their life has been taken away from them and like they can't ever really do what they want so they try to make their kids life out their dreams not fully realizing that they are their own people and need to have the freedom to figure out what they want (if only so they don't continue the circle of mindless childmaking).",

I didn't get a shirt or anything because I was one of 3 (only one was there a day) . The only thing I had was a trainee badge. I get it people are hesitant as you are a trainee but when I went to help a <b> woman </b>who was walking around for like 10 minutes. She wanted to know about 3 games (I can't remember what they are). One of the games was Forza 7 and since she was stood in the playstation side I asked what console she had. When she saw I had a trainee badge she rudely said \"Obviously playstation 4 why do think I am at the playstation games. What should I expect you're a trainee so you know<b>  nothing</b> about games.\" I politely explained that Forza 7 is for xbox only. All i got from her was a response that I'm a trainee and I kno<b> w nothin</b>g. I don't often like talking about myself much especially in work as its unprofessional in this case I thought it might diffuse this situation. I told her that i'm here on work experience from my course in game design so I know about game. I tried explaining once more about the games she interrupted me almost instantly saying shut the fuck up you know jack shit about any games now get me a proper employee. Since this was the day of CoD WW2 there was another person on the shop floor and he saw I was uncomfortable and he let me know to tell her another person would help her after he checked something. I told her that another person will help her in a minute. I went to help those behind me as they was wanting help. Not 1 second after turning around all I heard was her screaming (keep in mind this store was busy as all hell) how dare you turn your fucking back on me you are helping me who the fuck do you think you are you total and utter asshole. She kept saying things along that line for about 15 seconds while this was going on her body language was getting more aggressive. I was scared while this was going on. This ended with her being kicked out. After this I helped the other person out and went into the back and a 16 ye<b> ar o</b>ld me who never have experienced customers like that before was on the verge of a panic attack as in the past I had experience with abuse and that gave me flashbacks to it.",

Great animation and I applaud you for tackling the side of a topic that doesn't seem to get much headlines and with more potential backlash. \n\nAs one of the older generation gamers out there (don't make me wave my cane in your British direction), Thank you for being you.  This video alone has made me hopeful and proud that the younger gen Y/Z nerd gamers out there are brought up with a good head on their shoulders. Thumbs up and a subscription.

There are asshole guys and fuck em, but why are there women doing same things? One day at work I encountered two girls that, while waiting in line, but basically next to me, were grumbling and gossiping loudly at some girl from their class, presumably, that my ears wanted to curl inwards... I was blown away by the level of \"ghetto\" in their conversation. Also at one job I was dubbed the \"rude guy\" for asking a mother to make her kids stop playing and running around the tables with computers, power wires and near windows... meanwhile all fathers I encountered over the span of 3 years in such situations would be like \"gotcha\" and proceed to calm down their kids and explain why it's dangerous. Worst case was when I had to handle situations where one partic<b> ular w</b>oman was very disrespectful to my co-worker, to the point she cried and ran away... and the moment I stepped near the counter to sort the shitstorm ou<b> t the </b>woman started acting all polite, smiling and like a<b>  swe</b>et old lady from the movies and was like \"oh how wonderful, this smart gentleman will help me perfectly\"... why",

Earned the subscribe!\n\nI found it interesting that the women portrayed in this video were older women who were likely unfamiliar with video games and the gaming community as a whole. It makes me wonder about <b> sexism </b>trends in England. Is gaming mostly viewed as \"for boys\" there? Are social barriers present for women doing things that are meant for boys? Are Tom boys (girl who likes things boys usually like to do) frowned upon over there? Is the female gaming community very small in England? I'd be very interested in hearing from you on this.\n\nThe most English experiences I've had were my friends showing picture and meeting a dude in New York City who gave me 2 pounds saying my first tea is on him when I visit so I wouldn't exactly know.",

            "commentText": "I can totally understand this I work in a pretty heavily male-dominated field. And I don't hold that against the guys who work there. it's just when people think of the Jolly Chef they usually always think male and loud. A good majority of the time <b> nobody </b>really takes me seriously. It's mostly because my<b>  age</b> but also m<b> y se</b>x. \n\n So when they want advice about anything they always go to my male co-workers. Even though I went to the French Culinary Institute ICC and specialize in  French cuisine, pastry and farm-to-table. But when somebody sees<b>  a chub</b>by girl who's a chef they automatically assume she only makes cupcakes.\n\n That is literally only a small portion of my job. So one time I was working at this restaurant and some person ask to see the chef because the food was amazing. So they called me out and I worry. But the say it is was someone complimenting me. After that I was pretty flattered that they wanted to compliment me. I was still a student at the time so this really lifted my spirits. \n\n That was until I actually got to the table. The ol<b> der wo</b>man states \"no, I didn't mean for my dessert I meant for my food.\" And that is when I said \"I made both actually.\" She was flabbergasted at this. She says to me \"I suppose the abundance of whipped cream on my dessert makes sense now. It's okay dear. Us girls love our dessert. I'm sure your children will enjoy that\" She made me feel so uncomfortable. this wasn't the first time something like this happened it was usually older women. one of them even accused me of flirting with her husband because I put an extra strawberry on his dessert. I just remembered that he always asked for an extra strawberry whenever he came for brunch. So I put one on before he asked. When you're 30 y<b> ears</b> old and people treat you like you're a baby<b>  it's </b>weird.",

It just burst right out of me. It said right on the case: \"Grand Theft Auto.\" Which is rated M for mature. And as such, Hollywood had a policy of not renting out such games to minors without adult supervision (much like their policy regarding R rated films). Meaning that the kid handed her the game and said, \"I want this!\" Mommy proceeded to get him this. Whoever was behind the counter when Mommy got him this probably explained that the game is rated M for mature, and she probably scoffed and rolled her eyes and handed him her credit card. And then later she went home and was shocked to discover that a game titled \"Grand Theft Auto\" involves property theft and violence.\n\nThe funny thing is, she was in fact shamed by that. Once I blurted out my reaction, it was obvious that she wasn't going to get away with subjecting a minimum wage employee to a scathing storm of criticism over his... working for a store that she had rented a mature game from, in spite of how insistent she was that this was someone's fault other than her own. She just left the game and fled with the kid in tow.",

            "commentText": "A really important story to share. I worked at a Fish and Chip restaurant to pay off my student overdraft (I love being a student, I promise :|) and routinely female customers would get quite aggressive and overly rude with female waitresses. If a male colleague came and explained the exact thing which the female waitress had explained, they would be content most of the time. If they weren't content, they would come to the kitchen (where I worked, hooray) and would demand an explanation. Our explanation would always clarify the problem and the issue was instantly resolved. I don't think my authority on the subject was questioned once, for any reason. \n\nAnd then for one month, one of the kitchen staff was female. And that poor girl got roasted by female customers for absolutely no reason, and we had to explain that she was correct multiple times to other women. It really opened my eyes to the fact that <b> sexism </b>towards either<b>  gender</b> can be directed at anyone, by anyone. Absolute clusterfuck. Before that I hadn't really encountered it myself either.",

Feminism means different things to different people. There is assholes that call themselves all sorts of things. Feminism covers such a broad spectrum of political ideas that imho it's just naive to say \"feminists are ____\" it would be like me saying \"people named Alex are ____\" it only creates the question of \"which?\"",

It's just that more dudes just so happened to play more games when the older generation was growing up and so some people in the older generation think it's strange to see women play video games.

Now all we have to do is wait for the older generation to die out and the newer generations to take a hold of society. Why even try to push a useless, made up agenda that won't do anything but hinder the very things we've already accomplished?

You still don't seem to get it. social change happens over the course many years NATURALLY after activists change the law. Let's talk about how <b> black </b>people finally got equal rights. Did<b>  racist</b> people suddenly go 'oh, I guess they're not bad people after all'? NO! They made the KKK! But guess what? The KKK aren't as present as they use to be since then. Why? Because the generation after the civil rights movement grew up in a society that SOMEWHAT accepte<b> d blac</b>k people and then the generation after that generation grew up in a society that got a lot CLOSER to accepti<b> ng bla</b>ck people and now generation z is growing up in a society that MOSTLY acce<b> pts bl</b>ack people. This is natural progression. I believe in activists changing the law, not changing social opinion. And yes, politically, everybody is equal. We h<b> ad a b</b>lack president to prove that.

Tome being a feminist is about working towards an end toward<b> s gende</b>r discrimination. That means I work towards and end towards trans discrimination, non-binary discrimination, male discrimination and female discrimination as well as all the places where they intersect. I do this through my role in my work. So yeah I don't care if some internet trolls think I'm a 'feminazi' but it does frustrate me that people think feminism is a homogeneous ideology... Because it just doesn't work that way. It's na\u00efve to think it would be. \ud83d\ude0a",

It's the same with mens rights activists. I don't see these people actually helping struggling men and women. I just see them complaining about feminists and the word feminism. I feel like certain people get hung up on the name feminist and rather than actually trying to make a positive impact with their lives they just tell everyone how much they are pro equality because they noticed how feminism has 'fem' at the start. Like I honestly don't care what you call it but do things that help people. You could call it shitism and I'd be for it if it involved not being a dick. Y'know what I mean?",

                    "commentText": "AP P Feminism has always had a conflict-rich history that pre-dates the so-called First Wave of feminism during the early 20th century that is often cited by radical and liberal feminists. Feminists have always existed in counter to societal and cultural disadvantages places upon women, some arising as early as 18th century Enlightenment-era Europe. It's gone strong before then, and has no signs of stopping today.\n\nMovements and ideologies don't end just because they grow big or because of dissenting voices. Historically, they've consistently created sub-ideologies or grow outwards to form their independent ideologies inspired by their parent philosophies. Which is exactly what is observed in current feminist affairs. This isn't a death cry, it's business and usual for any political/philosophical movements. In fact, having diverse voices in the discussion should be seen as a good sign that a movement has grown to included additional thoughts. A sign of a healthy movement, even if chaotic.\n\nThe thing about it mixing Marxist and socialist ideology is that feminism sprouted from and was inspired by a lot of leftist ideals, which share a core philosophy of anti-hierarchy. This is because a central element of feminism is combating sex/gender hierarchy in society and culture. If a hierarchy is unjust and subjugates people according to their sex/gender, then that is a problem for feminism to tackle. This isn't a flaw of feminism, but merely it's nature.\n\nAnd even if you disagree with Marxist and socialist philosophies, there are branches of feminism that don't embrace those ideas in their movement.\n\nI'm curious to know who or what you're hearing this from, because your source and the context matters. From my experience feminism has done what it has always done since the beginning, it's just that some people will disagree (sometimes violently) and always view feminism as an inconvenience.\n\nIf you're interested, because It can help help, I can recommend some reading materials that can give more context on feminism. There's a lot of misunderstanding that happens, sometimes from people of bad faith, that go and discredit feminism as a whole despite its nuances. It's better to expose and understand the source material, and it's people, to grow perspective from there.",

If a man is sexist to women odds are he's not going to get a mate, but a <b> woman </b>being sexist to other women is beneficial as you can make another<b>  woman</b> seem worse than she really is to a man and odds are tha<b> t woma</b>n may not get the man you want leaving that man open for you to take. Yes, I'm leaving out homosexuality due to the simple fact that it's not <b> as comm</b>on as heterosexuality, but I am not saying homosexuality is a bad thing.

I have pondered a<b> bout se</b>xism and Homosexuality and trust me it gets complex. \n\nWhen I say Statically I'm also meaning on Average as well. Of course, there will be men who are sexist.

WHY? b/c voting equaled being drafted into a war if needed and if you don't think that voting and being drafted are connected then just look at the 26th amendment of the USA constitution on March 10, 1971. The entire reason for that amendment was so that draftable aged men (18) could vote. Due to the fact that Voting equaled being drafted meant that women didn't want to vote. I'm not saying women shouldn't vote. I think they should be able to. Whether you want to believe it or not boys were sold off to <b> old </b>women and men to be child husbands just like girls were sold off to<b>  old</b> women and men to be child wives. That wasn't a gendered issue back then it was a child issue with Pedophilia. Men in porn objectified just as much as women are. I won't say that the past doesn't affect the present as it does, in fact, affect the present, but there are things in the past that we have done to correct ourselves on. Let's say there is a score balance system of things we've done wrong in the past and that was at a score of -1 and then we fixed our mistake and put it at a 0. Tell me why we need to push forward more stuff to correct things we've already corrected like the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (looking at an economic point of view and knowing that women are just as capable as men to do a job I think if I was able to pay women less I would hire women over men and by doing so making it where women are paid more than men overall).\n\nDon't be putting this on me YOU DON'T KNOW ME AND YOU CERTAINLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT I HAVE BEEN THROUGH!

The Funny part about all of this was the fact that youtube didn't notify me about your comment until today. Again I just want to repeat myself I think women should be able to vote. I can't wait until This Equal Rights Amendment gets amended b/c then you will see that men and women weren't treated equally before, not just women. If you have any daughters you will see them being scared of getting drafted into a war they didn't want to be in like the men in WW1&2 and the Vietnam war. You will also see that in divorces with children it will be 50/50 instead of women winning full custody over the children most of the time. I can go on and on how men aren't treated equally in our society. I acknowledge that women aren't treated equally in some circumstances just like how men aren't treated equally in some circumstances, but I see that you don't even acknowledge that men aren't treated equally in some circumstances. \n\nI also think it's funny how you only pointed out the women's suffrage out of everything else I have said. If you look in what I said before I did take what you said personally and I still do. You saying I don't know how to take things personally is a personal attack within itself.",

Both genders have their struggles. The important thing is that the law now sides with both genders and one does not have a legal advantage over the other. In this sense we are equal and have the chance to fight any injustice caused by any individuals or corporations (Edit: Figured it was important to mention that I live in the USA).",

It gets a little tiring when you see so many on social media do it blatantly for the views/likes. You have to admit, identity politics gets out of hand at times and it's promoting a lot of victim mentality to the point where people are almost on the lookout for even the slightest sign of<b>  sexism</b> o<b> r racis</b>m just so they can call it out on social media for likes/views. But when I heard this video in it's entirety it was her explaining her experience in detail and she wasn't preachy about it; She wasn't making any demands; Nor was she generalizing any groups of people based <b> on gend</b>er. She was frustrated and understandably so. I'<b> m a wo</b>man and if I were in her shoes it would frustrate the living hell out of me too.",

I then asked if they could order it and I was brushed off and told no in a bitchy undertone, as if I was an idiot.\nTo this day, I have no idea what the fuck that was! Why were there no other employs? What the hell was the scene that I was witnessing? How did they let staff like that work there? But that day, I kept wondering on what I did wrong. \n\nWell afterwards I went to another store (same brand), where I was immediately offered the option of ordering any edition with a discount! Which kind of made it worthwhile, but I'll just stick to steam from now on.",

            "commentText": "5:50 and 9:04 It is not <b> sexism.</b> It is logical. Most women don't play men's games. Most \"female gamers\" are on the mobile market, if you eliminate it, you are left with a weak 20%, not even... and if you only take FPS, survival, strategy and such... females? What is that?... So when a mother tries to get a toy to her boy, seeing you she will make a proper risk/probability assumption. She has a little boy and fucking the gift up could be a monumental bummer. As such she needs to find someone who is at least likely to know about games and to know about games that interest males (it is not cultural, it is biological). As such, not knowing you are a<b>  tomboy</b>, she goes looking for the one she thinks is better suited to give advices.\n\nAlso one very important thing: Females do that to you because they were at your point once in life. They know better than anyone how to get a job and advantages because of their pussies and know even better why they would not employ themself... As every fucking day, I have to put to the trash and rework entire codes of my female workers who are here only because of affirmative actions. They can't code for shit, create not wealth but troubles and TROUBLES only, and I have to pretend to do my work while I also do THEYR fucking work without telling anyone. The boss knows about it, I get wealth, under the fucking table... because if I leave the entire thing will crumble to pieces as many of our competitors... but I don't know how much I can handle, I don't know how long will Europe last until we take back the vote for women and educate them as to be loving brides instead of the ugls, gold digging monster we let them become.\n\nThere are competent women. Rarer than the already rare enough competent men... but here we are killing the competents in favore of parazites. I will and do honor women who deserve it, not more not tess than they need to be, compared to their male counterparts, on an individual basis. but kno<b> w woma</b>n... that this is n<b> ot sexi</b>sm you experiance. It is people who don't know you and as such take the best, probability wise better solution. They assumed you were here because of your vagina, because of affirmative tyranny.",

I've only ever had a sexist moment once while working in retail, (in an awesome place that rhymes with Tar-gos) when I was chatting to a dad and his kid because he was looking for<b>  age</b> appropriate games for his 8 yea<b> r ol</b>d but also some cool games for himself that were OK for family, and his wife/girlfriend/whatever rolled her eyes at my suggestions and kept tutting and looking on her phone. It wasn't until later after I'd talked to the guy for a bit, suggested Crash N Sane trilogy and the uncharted games that his partner let out a huge sigh and told him \"We should just see one of the lads they'll sort us out.\"\nI was all \"..whut? Cause I dont got no penis doesn't mean I don't know games, lady.\" But obvs, being in retail, you just scrunch your face up and smile through it.\nI think I won though, the dude bought Crash n Sane trilogy and Uncharted 4 and the dlc game lol \n\nBest thing that ever happened to me though was this kid who was really sad because he'd just found out (after spending 20 minutes looking) that Cuphead ISN'T a disc, but download only game (Feckin shame at that, it should totally be disc.) His second and third choice games were out of stock, or simply didn't exist on disc and were download only. He was only like.. 11 but he started to cry a bit because his dad owned his xbox and he was away working out of the country, so he couldn't buy games on the online store until he got home. The kid was there with his nan, who looked absolutely clueless about games and kept suggesting he buy toys that were not in h<b> is a</b>ge range (bless her) and on top of all of this, it was the kid's birthday! So he wasn't getting a present that day. \nI asked them to wait a few minutes while I clocked out of my shift and then caught up with them after and told the lady to take her kid to a certain shop in a certain town, because although they dont have the games the kid wanted, they DID have merch of Cuphead, bendy, fnaf games etc which I think would've made the kid super happy. \nShe turned up a few weeks later and thanked me and said her grandson went home with some toys afterall! haha :')",

This isn't a defence, it's a reasoning. Personally, I never deal with the salesperson, the conversation normally goes;\nMe browsing Xbox one games\nGAME employee: \"hi, you looking for anything?\"\nMe:\"no thx, just browsing\"\nEmployee:\"Anything in particular?\"\nMe:\"No, thank you\"\n\nOr , if I'll ask if they sell certain things, I was advised by a game employee when I asked whether they sold 1TB hard drives (ext) for xb1 to not buy it and instead they gave me websites that stock 2tb hard drives , I'll ask for a personal opinion on games, and often I get into discussions, whereas gamestop tries pestering people in store to buy games, GAME is the complete opposite, they're quite laid back , and it's not just my seaside town one , i've gone to the one in London and Norwich, and it was the exact service there",

You'll see asshole backstabbing women 50-100 times more than a murderous rapist men (that you would even encounter once in a fucking lifetime if not never). Also because of blatant brainwashing medias, sexist and <b> racist </b>men are almost completely nonexistent only if they were just being sarcastic. I know a lot of men are just avoiding women now entirely. Why would we need to suffer for this 0.0001% chance of happening excuses or reason? Where we are surrounded by toxic, narcissistic, and entitled women left and right? Why would we need to suffer by you assholes that are just angry for us existing? It's like what this video shows, women are the worst enemy of other women. You hate each other because of your insecurities and jealousy. Why would us need to suffer for that? Why would us men need to blame for what you are completely lacking and need to work on yourselves. We men worked our issues with only ourselves! Why would you need someone's approval like the medias and other beta simps to solve your issues. No wonder you women became spoiled like this. If there's a question about who's the most coward and selfish people on Earth, I would never answer that specifically. Because I met a lot of women hundred times worse than the men I hate, it's almost like if their<b>  gender</b> bend their crimes would be worse than death. I'm sorry for being sexist but it is what I encountered and experienced. You women were just children in an adult body.",

She's 9, but Call of Duty is one of her favorite games to play with me, but she doesn't know which ones are better than others. As I'm explaining to her why we should get Modern Warfare instead Advanced Warfare, some guys came up to us said word for word \"First of all, why are explaining Call of Duty to her? She's a little girl. Get a game more suited for her. Second of all, don't you know that girls aren't exactly good at Call of Duty or even fps games in general?\" I was about a.half second from decking him in the face, but a store manager overheard the confrontation and made a wager. If me and my sister could beat the other guys in a round of Team Deathmatch on Modern Warfare, the guys had to apologize and my sister and I could buy Modern Warfare and get a second game for free. We walked out the store with Modern Warfare for $15(used) and my little sister was holding a free, brand new copy if Battlefield: Bad Company 2. It was a good day.",

Seeing that he was experienced, I'm going to guess he didn't give a shit.

Also being watched and monitored (because you obviously wont let them see something like nudity or whatever). I mean, I'm a girl and 14 but I've never liked barbies or dress up and stuff. Still don't. I love to play COD and other shooting games with my older nephew and older brother. When I was very young my parents started teaching me the importance of gun safety and how to properly handle a gun and disarm a dangerous situation in case of attacks or anything. I was taught that guns are not toys and can take lives. I went to the shooting range at a young <b> age </b>and still do. I'm the youngest in my family but am the best shooter and know gun safety better than all my siblings. I'm a girl, but that doesn't mean I HAVE to like make up and dolls. I love video games and target shooting. I won't let anyone take that from me.",

Sorry, but this kind of inconsistency is why you don't get to make this decision. You're a child, you want to play these games because they're fun and cool, but the reason you're being told you can't is meant to be for your own good. You might even be ok, totally unaffected by it, you might be mature for your <b> age,</b> you might be able to easily draw a line between fictional violence and real life. Not everyone is the same though....you've said yourself, you think a little bit of nudity in a game is bad and only 17+ should be able to play it.....why? Because it might affect their views on women? Why, then, can you not see the obvious parallel with violence being inappropriate for children?\n\n\nSage of Fire - When everyone but a 14 year<b>  old</b> is calling bullshit on your argument, I wouldn't be too proud of that. \n\nAlso, having their parents say it is ok doesn't make it right.

There is a substantial amount of evidence from studies that prove games don't cause violence and none to support that it does cause it. how ever it is Illegal to sell any game rated M to any persons under the <b> age </b>of 17 in most countries and the few its not it's instead illegal to sell it to those under 18. So that's what people are saying.\n\n It's the same problem I have with the media saying that games like Call of duty cause violence in children and I mean beyond the mountain of evidence to prove they don't. Because Every game they claim causes child violence is a game Illegal to sell to children. A game for adults who are never in these big news stories because adults generally know better and aren't as impulsive. A problem with the child and the parenting not the game.\n\n It's like saying it's Illegal to sell a hand gun to any persons under the<b>  age</b> of 21 in the USA. So the mom and dad chose to buy their 5 yea<b> r ol</b>d a hand gun for hunting in the woods behind their house. Then they act surprised and that they have no responsibility when their child does somethi<b> ng du</b>mb with it and say stuff like its the guns fault not mine for skirting the law. No one would fucking buy that so why do they do it with games. \n\nIt's a matter of parents wanting to avoid responsibility with raising their children not the games. And while I do think what media you let your child consume is up to the parents discretion <b> the </b>age ratings are there for a reason. you can't show your child a rated R movie then claim it was the movies fault your child had a bad dream why do people think you can do it with games.",

That has the exact same content as Call of Duty, but it's rated T so that it can be on a Nintendo system. Call of Futy should be rated T if you ask me. It has shooting and cursing. You know what else has shooting and cursing but only gets a 13+<b> age </b>rating? Action movies. I know the MCU has tons of killing and cursing, just like CoD, so why is CoD so looked down upon when the ESRB clearly just wanted to make the game look like more than it actually was?",

You let her get a call of duty game at 9?\nThat's either a disaster or YouTube video waiting to happen. Far too young (in my opinion) to play call of duty. I'm still cross about some kids ruining my experience with their toxic behaviour. \nI ain't accusing her of being like them, if you trust her enough to get that game for her then she must be an angel, if so then congratulations for being a good parent.\n\nBut to say the least, not nearly as sexist as you'd think when you look at it from a different point of view.",

I love all the comments \"disavowing\" actual hatred of men...oh wait...they don't exist.  Only in the mind of Rose.\n\nAnd then we have Julia with her \"no true scotsman fallacy\" saying how THE ACTUAL REALLY REAL Scotsman...I mean feminists actually don't hate men.  \n\nThis is literally the same goddamn responses I get all the time when I point this shit out.  \"It's just a joke, you missed it\" or \"REAL FEMINISTS do this\".  No, I am sick and tired of the same song and dance.  Take responsibility for your goddamn ideology.  Hell I will give MGTOW credit, at least men who follow MGTOW don't go \"oh that's not real MGTOW\", they take responsibility when they say the radical line of \"the government needs to take women's rights away\".  They OWN that level in insanity, however feminists don't own their insanity and push it off onto someone else.\n\nGet a new trick, and you morons can start by NOT attacking the ones who are being critical of your ideology.  You want me to believe that feminism is \"for everyone\", then go after the majority that's clearly doing your brand of feminism wrong...but good luck changing anyone's mind.  \n\nI need to bring this up again so they truly get it, Rose Juliette thinks #KillAllMen was just a silly joke everyone, no need to get offended for people wanting to kill half the world's population.

Yes there are feminists who actually want equality, but the majority of feminists are doing more harm than good and use the same patterns to try and make men look like terrible little demon shits that need to be wiped off the face of the earth simply by triggering the men as much as possible then blame the men for reacting with anger after an half an hour to an hour of BS and constant pushing by the feminist.\n\nTL;DR you are using the same pattern as every feminist does and Simpleton Apollo is right in every point he has made even if it was a rage rant.",

You say things like 'most feminists' but have you met most feminists? Have you read any large survey results of popular feminist opinion? If I was to give an example... One of the largest feminist organisations in the US is 'NOW'. They have existed since the 60s and have worked with so many people to petition for; <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>rights<b> , disable</b>d rights, an end to system<b> ic raci</b>sm in employment, and what may be a surprise to you... They fought to <b> end gen</b>der discrimination towards men in child custody laws. I'm not saying that assholes don't exist. I am just questioning what is clearly a stereotype of feminism. I think raging on the internet at people who barely mentioned feminism is a bit of an asshole thing to do. You say he is right but I don't see anything backing up that opinion. Just restating stereotypes and then accusing me of being just like them. It seems like an us Vs them mentality. That doesn't align with the work I do or the people I know. I've never met man hater personally even though I do know they exist.",

Its happened so much I learned what they do all the time without even wanting to know, some things you learn out of experience, and feminists are all over the internet posted by the people who got in the feminists way and the feminist tried,, and in some cases succeeded, in destroying the poor mans social life by acting like the victim after pushing the man or men over the edge into doing something reactively and instinctively.\n\nSo dont tell me theyre just generalisations if you cant be bothered to do a quick search of feminists on youtube, hell even news stations cover it and help in destroying the guys life by siding with the feminists that walk up to a random stranger and start to push buttons as much as  possible.\n\nthe usual  femisits will walk up to a random man, who is doing his own thing not bothering anybody, and start ranting off about how men are the worst and that they should be treated as a slave \"For their crimes\" or some shit, then theyll make themselves as irritating as possible and push as many buttons till they get a reaction, once they get a reaction theyll make the biggest scene they can and dramatically act as if the man did it for no reason, knowing full well that most men are physical beings to begin with.",

Not to mention you can pretty much always tell if theyre faking it or if theyre not just by studying their voice, the stuff they say, what theyre doing, and compare all that to others and theyd do in the same situation, or at least a very similar situation.\n\n2) yes men have their own emotions, but at the same time when you go up to a group of <b> black </b>males preaching about god and jesus and suddenly a feminist walks up and starts harrassing them and pushing their buttons as much as possible, its not their fault at that point. the feminist clearly went out of her way to try and ruin the groups social life in that instance. And to be frank, you may control your own actions but if someone is going out of their way to manipulate the situation into doing something you'd not ever dream of doing at any other time I wont be blaming the<b>  black</b> guy for shoving the feminist, ill be blaming the feminist for instigating and antagonizing the group that were doing no harm, and manipulating the situation into getting the guy to lose his shit half an hour later of constant button pushing and reacting badly after losing control",

I doubt men would have much more rights than women in those places as generally speaking those countries have a distinct lack of human rights to begin with, so it aint just women who have these issues.",

I worked at GAME from September '17 to June '18 - also initially as a Christmas temp. I received numerous sexist and rude comments from customers (predominantly male). \n\nHere are some of my best moments:\n\n1. Trying to find some games from one of the lower drawers behind the counter & the gentleman I was serving says to my male colleague that he must 'love to see me on my knees'. I should add that he had his grandkids with him & I can't imagine what wonderful habits they're picking up.\n\n2. Being asked by a customer what I usually play. A male colleague butting in saying that I mainly play JRPG. Then getting called a fake gamer and being told I shouldn't be working for a games store. \n\n3. And much like your experiences mentioned in the video, the countless times I had both male and female customers saying they'd rather speak to a male employee because they would know more. One <b> woman </b>I had to deal with was borderline trying to make a complaint about me despite me and the manager saying the exact same thing to solve the issue she was having. \n\nMy team were nice but the customers were a huge reason I didn't enjoy my time working for the company. Although the gaming industry is making moves in terms of less<b>  sexism</b> directed towards women, it's sad to see that even a few years after your experiences, the same issues are still prevalent. \n\nThank you for sharing these experiences. It's oddly comforting to know that I wasn't the only one who was mistreated by others due to being <b> a woma</b>n \u2665",

I approached the till where a young <b> woman </b>was and asked the guy sorting the shelves behind her whether the wired Xbox360 controller would work on PC. She was the one that answered exactly how it would. She wasn't angry she just answered my question to be helpful, but I eventually realised what I'd done. I didn't think of myself as sexist at the time, but I guess subconsciously there's more to grapple with. I still have that controller, it's pretty robust. Hopefully realising my mistake has since helped me not make more serious mistakes.",

I work at Homebase (soon to be \"worked\" since our store is one of the ones shutting down) so you know, tools, gardening equipment etc. Quite a few of my colleagues are women and have been there for much longer than I have and generally know what they're about when it comes to our stock. I, on the other hand, am just some guy who works behind the till. I have no interest in gardening, painting/decorating or DIY and only really know the location of items not how they're used or which tool fits which job. Yet time and again I've seen and heard customers pass over my more experienced female colleagues who are ready to help, to \"ask one of the guys\" (often me) to which I've had to respond with a weak smile and a \"Sorry, I'm not sure about that.

They LITERALLY pat me on the head as in, \"aw look how cute, you're playing board games with the men\" and then proceed to explain the game. I keep trying to politely interject with I've played this before, but my dad gives me the \"don't be rude, let them finish look\". \nCut to the end of the game, during which they tried to give me constant advice that i frequently ignored, and I fucking beat them.

Similarly, the most expert people in the sewing shop up the street are not middle-aged women but cosplayers of various sexes. The time I visited such a shop with middle-aged women working there, several knew <b> nothing </b>about sewing. So the mistake is assuming that someone who works in a shop knows or does not know something based on external qualities... fact is, all of them unless they're new ought to know the merchandise and hopefully know a little about how it's used. \n\nI guess I'm saying, it's really<b>  weird</b> to pick something so irrelevant as a means of judging. Some people don't know their stuff but it certainly isn't because of who or what they are.",

Not only did I ADORE the animations and way you presented this video, but the topic that you spoke out about was actually interesting and not what I expected :) I still play <b> OLD </b>games, like we're talking Bioshock and Deus Ex back on the 360 and I have been in Game quite a bit to buy them... and some of the stuff you talked about was very relatable and real. This video was such a nice change from the usual video game rants that plague the internet. I loved it and I am so happy I found a new channel which I will now binge every video for :)",

It draws us in with its stupidity until we respond to it as though it is real. It isn't. That's why you don't often meet these people in the real world.

Yep so very narrow. It's not like this has been a reoccurring theme in resistance to change for like decades. \"It's political correctness gone mad\" they cried whilst making up stories of oppressive hippies in the 60s. \n\nAlso urban dictionary is not a good source of public opinion. If you could provide me a source that shows that public opinion aligns with urban dictionary I will eat my hat. Urban dictionary was created to document <b> dumb </b>internet terms in a satire way... Plus did you even read the sources? I swear this is one of the most lackluster conversations I have had in a long time. It is really disappointing when the level of argument is just making shit up and saying the other person doesn't make sense. \n\nYou create an enemy that has so broad a definition and is so undeniably unlikable that rather than actually engage with the conversation you just accuse the other person of being part of that group in the hopes that counts as a refutation. And by pointing this out 'clearly' I'm just an SJW too. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nI don't even have to say anything even related to social justice. I just have to challenge your narrative and I'll be framed as an SJW... Which was the point I made in my initial comment. Outrage at hypothetical SJW and Feminazis who hypothetically would be making irrational arguments and shouting at people. No actual reference to people who do this and identify as these people. Just a strawman cast in the general direction of those you would hypothetically disagree with.\n\nSo yeah framing people as SJW and Feminazis is<b>  dumb</b> and irrelevant to the video. It's just a way to pat yourself on the back for not having the opinions of hypothetical assholes who are angry a<b> t nothin</b>g... Only you are angry <b> at nothi</b>ng because those SJW and Feminazis aren't here.\n\nI don't know how many other ways I can explain this to you. Either you can show that there is reason to be outraged about real people and that it is relevant to this video... Or you can't and it is just more unnecessary outrage towards hypothetical people who you claim to be unnecessarily outraged. \n\nWhat'll it be? \ud83d\ude09",

If you are so sure of your opinion how come your own \"sources\" (and I use that term very loosely) disagree with you. Here are some quotes from the definitions you linked to. \n\nSJW\n\"the term has continued to evolve. While the previous definition sometimes applies, it's now often used simply as an excuse to dismiss things other people say without having to think about them at all, regardless of whether or not they have a valid point. In other words, it's increasingly used as if it's a \"get out of jail free\" card for insulting entire groups of people. This watering down of the meaning is slowly turning the term into a meaningless insult.\"\n\nFeminazis\n\"the idea of conflating a liberation movement with Nazism is just deeply ignorant. It's self-undermining, because it's so over the top\"\n\nMy dismissal of your source wasn't because it 'proved' me wrong. Both your sources reiterate things I have already said. I just think it's silly to use an urban dictionaryn definition as a proof of existence. Especially since it also defines SJW as a skeleton jazz wizard. \n\nI sent you a video that displays a concrete example of how SJW are imagined by people to generate marketable outrage. Since you have not already absorbed that I will recommend you give it a watch.\n\nI dunno maybe you are really young and inexperienced or something. Maybe you haven't developed a good understanding of how evidence based argumentation works. Maybe you are just headstrong and unwilling to reflect on your own opinion. It's certainly something that happens during people's teen years. This sense that there is an objective truth that only you and those who agree with you can see.\n\nUnfortunately, so far all you have done is claim a group of people exist and are doing something bad and then shown a definition of them. This is not a proof it is a hypothesis (and I'm using that word very generously here)\n\nThe fact is you haven't shown me these people. Where are these people? Are they a minority? Are they prolific? Are they relevant to this video? Are they really doing the things you say? Do they identify with the terms you use? Can you provide evidence of them?\n\nThese are rhetorical questions at this point as this conversation is over for me. I hope in the future you will learn to substantiate your arguments and acknowledge legitimate challenges to that argument. It genuinely is a pity that you failed to understand the principles that could have made this discussion worthwhile. \n\nSee you later \ud83d\udd3a\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f",

I've had one complain about me to a coworker while I was right there and how he would be better suited to work the shop floor. The best part about this so far is the look on their faces when I have conversations with their children about games.",

You want to rid of that stigma? vote out affirmative action after all were equal so why do females need special treatment in the hiring place?. If affirmative action is gone the stigma will go away and yes their are ALOT of female workers that dont know how to do their job and were there thanks to affirmative action.

Ah I miss when game stores were about big halls with roads of roads of amazing games.\nI loved Game, I still got my Game card. But sadly it closed down and Gamestop is mostly merchandise and not half as big as the previous room just two stores next to it's current location. Also you're awesome. Amazing pony art for the kids to enjoy. Also you talk about an issue from the other side. And you're not trying to paint a message, you're just telling the truth and make a valid point. I love that in people and to be enthusiastic about yourself. Too bad I feel like too many people are terrified inside of their comfort zone of other's influence on how they should act. I always smiles and walk like a rainbow is up ahead but everyone else just look like orcs just lost the jackpot and <b> nobody </b>seems to have a reason to live their life, just accepting that their shit is permanent and don't try anything to fix it. It's sad, glad honest open people exist on the internet and express their true selves, maybe a little too much in the wrong way sometimes",

                    "commentText": "@kumagin yurier You're being completely disingenuous. When people complain about videos in which women lie about being abused, you suggest men simply ignore the videos and stop complaining about them. Is that really what you think? That it's okay for people to lie and anyone who has a problem with dishonesty should turn their head?\n\nThere are genuine victims who talk about genuine problems they face. However, you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater when you dismiss all criticisms of people claiming they were abused. Some people have legitimate stories, others have been caught lying. We can support actual victims while calling out frauds, we don't have to always support claims of <b> sexual </b>abuse or always oppose such claims, we can look at the evidence and judge all stories individually. \n\nFurthermore, your claim that if men really cared about abuse victims, they'd advocate awareness of male abuse. This is a false dichotomy. Many people genuinely care about abuse victims, yet they are mostly familiar with female abuse, which causes them to overlook male victims. There are also plenty of people who do spread awareness of male abuse. RAINN.org does a great job addressing all forms of<b>  sexual</b> abuse and it's a great example of awareness done right.\n\nThere's plenty o<b> f sexis</b>m in this world, but you're only looking <b> at sexi</b>sm women face. W<b> hat sex</b>ism men face you either ignore or blame on men.\n\n\"After all, women's takes on issues are only worth anything if they're opinions palatable to guys\"\n\nOr, maybe, your sharing flawed opinions with men who have a good head on their shoulder. You claim they're criticizing you because you'<b> re a w</b>oman, but really they're criticizing you because you're wrong. Rarely do I hear legitimate examples of women having their opinions brushed aside due to <b> their g</b>ender. Usually, their opinions are brushed aside because their opinions are wrong. It's like claiming the world is flat and that all the men correcting you are simply being sexist when they say you're wrong.",

I worked at gamestation at the same time also as a Xmas temp we had to ware the <b> fat </b>Chris T-shirts oh how I hated the T-shirt and the adverts, just before I was did a free years work through school and they kept giving me bs we wanted you to go college and kept hiring awful people over me I basically was you but male haha told to basically attack them when they stepped in but I always choose to do other work let them try themselves then swoop in if they needed help dealt with language, education and<b>  age</b> barriers I was good as long as dancing, singing or sports games didn't pop up haha but the only bad thing I ever did was trying to trick <b> a woma</b>n who I knew was the mother of a friend I almost got her to buy him a pink PSP under the disguise of it being cheaper I almost had her and was waiting for the jokes punchline \ud83d\ude11 but I was weak, but even though at the time game bought gamestation I always thought there was a difference like when I went into a game store to just ask some questions about the \ud83e\udd22 Kinect sensor I spoke to a girl who clearly wasn't a gamer and was there for the paycheck she said I don't know  so I went to the assistant manager as that was the only other person on the shop floor at the time gave me some pr bs speech then roped the girl into it saying I have my pre-ordered what about you then she agreed with everything said she had it pre-ordered as well and all I could think was how could someone pre-order something they didn't know what it was so I just learnt to never go near the girl and guy ever again but learnt the guy only ever play FIFA and formula1 which I never consider games hell it was basically our generation of pong but then sadly gamestation lost staff that were replaced with game staff when both stores were shutting store and then in my area there were no real store that could give detail information there was like two employees but he and she were always working on my education off days so I was never was in town on those days, then the ultimate fate happened young people couldn't get temp jobs there it was full of 40 and 50 year olds that didn't game which I ask  they were forced into the jobs by the government and so I stopped applying and I almost sounded like a conspiracy nut at the time saying they are out to stop me from buying the games haha",

It gets the point across without complaining too much, dragging on the stories, and thankfully keeping your voice sounding cheery the entire time. I've noticed how ignorant some people can be when it comes to how they treat the people helping them through stores, regardless of <b> gender,</b> and it's quite frustrating. When it comes to something along gaming, a lot of people say that men/boys are better at knowing everything about games, but I completely disagree. Nowadays, it's actually quite<b>  common</b> that I run into women that know just as much about video games as I do, even more sometimes, and I don't mind. It's not like games ar<b> e gende</b>r specific, just like how really everything shouldn't be, even though some things are just pushed into being that way. Coming from t<b> he <b> LG<<b> /b</b</b>>>BT community, I see conversations about stereotypes all the time, and I hate hearing them. It's one of the reasons why I wish people would just shut up and listen sometimes, because not everyone fits into the \"Oh, I'm<b>  this g</b>ender, or this type of person, so this is everything that I'm allowed to do, while this is everything I'm not allowed to do\", because the real world doesn't work that way.\n\nWhile I am in no way a hater of women's rights movements, I believe that (by what I've seen and by what I've been shown), that a lot of the feminist movement (or, more so, those that try to spearhead the movement), have treated it as if men are the issue, and while I'm not turning that down, that yes, there are some men that are complete jerks and don't consider women to be humans, and mere objects, there are a lot of men that wouldn't treat someone, if anyone at all, like an object. I've stuck to being as respectful as I can, because I'm aware that women are just as capable as men are at many things, even if stereotypes have attempted to paint them in a worse light. I've seen women capable of doing things that I couldn't even dare to try, and that's impressive to me. I wish that more people realized this, and that people would try to shut up and listen for a few minutes. Is it too late into this comment to mention I'm from the Americas?\n\nEither way, you did an amazing job recapping the stories, and it's great to hear how you deal with it now, than having held a constant grudge over it for all this time, while still showing that it is something that is an important issue to address. It's not often that I watch anything like this, due to how YouTube handles recommendations of this type of stuff, as well as hating how negative everything is in those types of videos normally.\n\nThis was longer than I wanted this comment to be, but hey, screw it. Thanks for the entertainment. Keep up the good work.",

He brings over about 5 different scrubs (only one had the right consistency) and starts slathering them onto my hands!! I'm autistic and HATE being touched, especially by people I don't know. I quickly decided on the most <b> coarse </b>scrub just to end the trauma, and promptly went to the till to pay for my way overpriced scrub. I'm never walking into a Lush store again.",

But what she would complain fairly regularly when women would come in looking for something for themselves, or for their husband/s.o., and would blatantly tell her to her face that they needed a man to help them because she couldn't possibly know what they need.   \nOne of the things I learned there was that a lot of men are assholes to everyone, but a lot women were much more offensive about sticking to<b>  gender</b> roles.",

            "commentText": "Not gonna lie, from what my female friends told me, other women hammer them down more often than sexist dudes. I met this girl and she just went through a break up and it was ugly, so I helped her. FYI she's <b> gay<b>  </b</b>>so I stand no chance in getting poon for being a \"nice guy\". Just clearing that out of the way. Anywho, I basically helped her reorient her life and goals and shit. Instead of \"She was my world Dx\" I managed to convince her to change her mindset to putting herself in the center of her world, not someone else that might up and leave and leave her weak and useless. Shit like that, shit we learn after making that same mistake. \n\nSo, after like a year, she was doing great. She's a go-getter, owned her college assignments like a baws, doesn't rely on people and became someone people can rely on, dudes got wow-ed, doesn't break down as often, she look like she got her shit together. I was proud of her. And then her female friends came to destroy what I helped build. They discouraged her attempt at self-sufficiency, feeding her shit about being <b> a woma</b>n and rely more on men, be dependent and meek and clingy and sappy and all that sexist shit. She got shook, questioning her progress,  because deep down inside, she's still insecure about herself. While she did get back up again instead of returning back to the soppy mess from before, it really pissed me off that her female friends see her rising out of t<b> he gend</b>er stereotype as something bad. Worst part is they managed to sound like they did it out of worry and love. \n\nThere's also <b> the </b>old hags that can't keep up with the times. The shit they said about career women when they gossip, worse than the shit I said about my worst enemy behind his back. Even my friend's fiancee thinks she should quit her job after they get married even though her career is on track and she'll be hitting the big bucks in 5 years or less, all because \"Well, I<b> 'm a w</b>oman. Women aren't suited for executive jobs like that.\" which is funny because both her mom an<b> d her </b>elder sister each runs their own business.",

You know, like what the entire rest of feminism talks about. Feminism is stupid, btw, did I mention that? Als<b> o, sexi</b>sm against men is important, let's not forget that, while we're here, watching a video abou<b> t a wo</b>man being discriminated against by men because of<b>  her ge</b>nder.\n\nGosh, you know.

Orders were going fine. Some stupid chavy teenagers went to rob the store by just taking a game off the shelf and running off with it but they don't realise that each game even preowned games that are displayed are just game cases no actual game disc. I saw some of them who returned at a later date got banned from the store and police were summoned.\n\nI remember helping alot of people with finding the right game for them or explaining a game's design etc. The most memorable one for me was this kid came to me with the PS2 case of Dragon Quest 8 asking me why do these characters look like dragon ball z characters? I told him the Dragon Quest series is art directed by Akira Toriyama the creator of the entire Dragon Ball Series, Chrono Trigger and Blue Dragon I remember telling him it was a open world and pretty  well detailed RPG with goofy characters and he bought it at the pre-owned price of \u00a313.\n\nWhen I saw your video i was like \"Oh man. Abusive ahole workers again?\" which is pretty<b>  common</b> fro<b> m sexua</b>l to verbal, not so much on physical harm. But it's pretty ignorant that a female customer would think that only men would know what game to get or system.\n\nAt the time I always keep up with the trends. My problem is that I talk too much I didn't know when to shut up at work.",

They were talking about hot girls and I was giggling and agreeing because I was a closeted bi, and all of a sudden they asked me if I had a crush. I said yes, and that he was really cool. They started to laugh and asked if I was <b> gay<b> .</b</b>> I said no I'm a girl. It was silent, before who I thought was my close friend started to hoot and holler and told me to get the fuck off. I was shocked and asked them what's the difference, that before they knew I was a girl they didn't act like this. They told me I was an attention seeker, for being bi, and liking games. They kicked me off the party and unfriended me. I never saw them again.\n\nAlthough I had found a new group that didn't care and were normal fucking human beings, that experience scarred me. It made me wary of when to speak in games. I know that they probably were just shocked to know the person they had been playing with had been totally different to what they imagined, so they lashed out but they shouldn't have gone so far, and done so much to begin with. I've forgiven them in my heart, even though they probably felt bad after.",

Growing up, those ladies were probably raised to believe guys knew about all video game stuff and girls only knew about barbies and such. I think we're much more progressive nowadays, but older generations just haven't all caught up. (Some of them, anyway).",

I used to work in Sports Direct, it was my first day and i was manning the Football Boots section. \n\nA lady brought her kids in to buy some new football boots and she had no idea what she was looking for. The kids obviously wanted the most expensive ones but in this case she wanted some advice. My colleague ( who was a <b> woman </b>who had worked in that section for 3 years and could easily be considered an expert) approached them as she was looking a bit lost. The lady completely dismissed her, said I need that mans help, walked right past and came to me asking for advice. \n\nThe look on the lady's face when i went straight to my colleague to ask HER for advice was amazing. It was like she couldn't believe what was she seeing. I hope she now realises that women can be experts in things considered 'boyish' too.",

But Im sure that both of us wish we were the lucky Americans with th<b> eir cr</b>azy good stocks. Anyways I do agree with your storie<b> s on se</b>xism, because I used to work at a firearms store, and I was usually just there to help  female/firstime  shooters pick a good gun that had light recoil so that they could use it. But what really happened was that when I told my female customers about the guns, they acted as if my male co workers were more gun savy,  so most of them, just stood away from the counter, and waited for a male worker,  I mean its not the worst thing that has happened to me on a job, but still I can pull my own weight just as much as any dude. So anyways sorry If i seemed rude in my comment about your working conditions,  I did not realise that you are in the uk, and have more economic problems then Canada and the Usa, but I will say this, thanks....for responding. . . it actually made my day, Im glad I just found your channel and cared about my stupid ideas enough to respond....so yeah thanks again. \ud83d\ude05",

            "commentText": "I work for [removed so I don't get fired] and I think this is just an issue with people in general and their attitude towards people they view as inferior - Sales people in shops -  rather than any fault with [removed so I don't get fired] themselves (which I acknowledge you seem to agree with me on). The vast majority of people I've worked with have been great (as are the majority of customers too!) and I've been doing this job most of my adult life.\n\nOutside of the typical inappropriate comments women likely get no matter what they're doing or where they are, they also have to deal with socially inept young men who don't get to meet women very often, focusing a lot of attention on them because the <b> woman </b>is a captive audience when she's at work. I imagine this is the case for women in any customer service role but I think in gaming focused retail, you get particularly socially inept men coming into the store - it's rarely sexually aggressive (Although it can be) but it's still uncomfortable for said employee. In my store, one of our female employees has several customers who come in every day, quite often specifically to talk to her for extended periods, many of them just come to talk to her because she's charming and funny and great to chat to about games (and she enjoys talking to these customers) but some of them clearly come in because she's a girl who will talk to them and mistake that for something more. As she's quite shy, she doesn't want to offend them and also doesn't want to potentially cause an incident at work with a customer - it hasn't been made clear in our training at work how we should react in these situations so we generally will call her into the stock room to do some work in there until the customer leaves. It can be very awkward and several customers have had to be asked to come to the store less often and not to speak to her as often because it makes her feel so uncomfortable. I really do not envy women working in retail, in particular in any kind of \"nerdy\" shop.\n\nI get flack infrequently from customers because I'm Jewish (Maybe once a month if that). Obviously, it doesn't come up often but sometimes customers will ask about my plans for Christmas and I'll tell them I'm Jewish or a colleague or regular customer will mention it - sometimes when people overhear in the queue, they won't be served by me (people of... ahem... a \"rival\" religion or people - generally students - who I assume do it out of anti-Zionist fury) or will make comments like \"Typical Jew\" when I try and upsell a product. I can laugh at myself and I can give as good as I get so I don't mind when someone makes a cheeky Jew joke just like if someone made a friendly joke about the colour of my hair or the phrasing I used in a particular sentence but some people are just outright antisemitic and it does always make me sad when it happens. This is something I face in general, in fairness, and isn't specific to my work - my colleagues in store would always defend me (but the know I can fight my own battles and don't need them to) and I'm pretty confident that the business at large would also have my back on this issue were it to go any further (when a customer described me as Jewish in a complaint made about me, they dismissed it outright and were professionally curt in their response).\n\nRetail, eh? It sucks and I can't wait to get out of it next year when I move abroad.",

I dunno how many times I was called up and was straight up told to transfer to a male tech before I had a chance to resolve anything. Internal transfers were prohibited on these grounds so thankfully it had the built-in revenge of the customer needing to go back through the automated voice routing system.\n\nEventually I got onto a conract so small that every member of the team was within koosh ball throwing distance. Calls could take eons because techs on the other end sometimes needed to <b> hike </b>between the printer and router. Oftentimes someone like this would call in, debate furiously about how I should be able to transfer them to a guy, hang up, go through the routing system again and ping the next available tech... Me.\n\nI once had a guy go three times around and boy was he pissed. All other techs were on massivly long calls and I had the fortune of just getting a bunch of short burnout calls (cold reset, re-seat it, still not working, here's a new one). The guy was every second call three times in a row. Demanded he be transferred to a manager who did have the power to transfer calls between agents but the manager refused to transfer him based on sexist bull (he was an awesome manager). The manager told him that all the techs are equally capable of solving his problem and that if he wants to he can play ring-around-the-routing system all bloody day as far as he was concerned. The guy hung up and called back and got THE ONLY OTHER FEMALE TECH ON THE CONTRACT. At this point we were all aware of the drama unfolding and laughing our collective asses off with mute button employed. The guy gave in, worked with the tech who cleared his problem in 7 minutes. Each time going through routing probably killed between 5-10 minutes.\n\nIt was a little insulting but damn was it ever funny.",

For me it was mostly guys that I had issues with, but it wasn't that <b> common.</b> The best justice was the one time a guy came in wanting to buy a new game system to play with his bros. I starting talking to him and tried to see what he wanted (basically he wanted to play sports games and shooter games and playing DVDs was a bonus). My other co-worker (a Nintendo fanboy) chimed in and started pitching the Gamecube to him. The guy immediately stopped talking to me and only listened to my co-worker. Once I realized he was ignoring me I shrugged and let him buy the wrong system. Don't get me wrong, the Gamecube is an awesome system, but not the one this guy wanted.",

I was expecting the usual politically motivated story but surprised to find a genuinely entertaining video with great artwork, about actual events! Great video.\n\nI applied for Game once, I ended up with a pizza delivery job instead. I'm glad I didn't go into retail to deal with that kind of stuff; god forbid being in your shoes in that situation, I'd be livid!\n\nNot sure if you're looking to work on YouTube full time, but the new membership feature could help you out; looks to be promising by providing the support animation channels like these need for time spent on projects and I'm sure people would be willing to back this level of quality!",

Most of the retail employees in game stores, are males, so of course there is a reason you \"stand\" out. However, the way these women treated you was hideous. I would be in my case, the granpa, somewhat sceptical, but not ignorant of someone's skills.\n\nAlso, think it that way. How many times have you walked in a PC store(not an<b>  Apple</b> store) and asked a female employee for the latest Z370 architecture in their motherboards' supply that has at least 2 PCIE lanes, or the best Intel CPU for value in the market right now. I bet the answer is either 0 or an dramatically low number, and the reason for this is that women do not actually choose to devote such a large amount of time to know such stuff for, in this case tech.\n\nIn the contrary, say how many times have you seen a male in a cosmetics store, and you particularly asked him for the best contouring option there is of your favorite brand. I believe the answer is also quite low.\n\nTo sum up, it is about career choice and human interaction motives. When someone is rooting for a certain motive, which in this situation is male employees in a game store, that someone could and might do an act o<b> f sexis</b>m. The same applies to many situations, but you should ALWAYS see an employee as a professional who happens to be male/female.",

I do agree on the whole, however I'd say that I believe knowledge is purely based on how passionate and driven an individual is about expanding their knowledge on said subject. Knowing very specific components of PCs is pretty niche regardless of whether they're male or female. If the person you're theoretically dealing with is building a PC, heck yes you should be very concerned if they don't know their shit. But if they're just staff at a store, I'd expect them to have decent knowledge, but be able to find out easily from a superior if they don't have that knowledge.\nThese women may well have just wanted to see a superior (not that it was possible, because they were all so busy) which is absolutely fine! But they did specifically ask for the men, which they may not have intended to be sexist... But it didn't sound to great out loud!",

In my case, my mother is very hardworking, and reached a peak of success where there are very few women. Just yesterday, I was buying glasses from a lady in her shop, and we were lovingly chit chatting. It happened she told me about a vacation she was going to do, and I gave her a few pieces of advice. When asked how I knew so much I explained that my mother was assigned in that region as a \"governor\", and I lived with her there for a few years... yet in the following conversation, the shop lady kept saying \"... so your father did this and that...\". It mattered not my answering with \"yes my mother\", she kept assuming I was somehow mixing my parents.\n\nI kinda of suppose this happens mostly with women for a reason: men do not really think about how hard is working for women, because they are not affected by it. Averagely, no man is really more surprised by a <b> woman </b>success than of a man success, because working is taken for granted and there is<b>  nothing</b> strange if someone is able to excel.\nYet all women FEEL the weight of the discrimination done by those that actively really hold a prejudice. And depending on the society, it may be so massive to the point that the women are the first to assume it is highly improbable for <b> a woma</b>n to hold a certain position of power, or that certain realms of knowledge are beyond reach. \n\nWe are yet to really brea<b> ch gend</b>er understanding.",

At my latest visit to Gamestop(which is the only game store left in the area) There's this mid-20's girl alone in the store. It's midday on a weekday, so no wonder. No fuss, I walk straight up to her:\n\"Hi, is it possible to pre-order the collectors edition of Battle for Azeroth here?\"\nPause. \n\"..the what now?\"\n\"Battle for Azeroth. It's an upcoming expansion of World of Warcraft\"\n\"Oh... what console is that for?\"\n\nSo, my bar for game store employees is pretty low. The one requirement I'm looking for is KNOWLEDGE OF GAMES! WoW is commonly known as the biggest mmo on PC. Been that way for 13 years. I'd understand the confusion if my question applied to a multi-platform game, but...\nI get that younger people need a job and would take almost anything, but customer service jobs in areas where you have no interests? Unlike Amy here, who did some research beforehand, it seems this girl was hired just to fill a spot.\n\nEnded up having to walk her through finding the product on the computer myself, even tho I've never worked in a Gamestop. Had she been graded, it was a class-act fail :p",

There was this older man, who apparently wanted to locate an ATM, but because of his accent, I had a hard time understanding what he was saying. But as I finally got what he said to me, and I started to give the directions to him he just pretty rudely stated: \"Oh never mind YOU wouldn't know anything about these things.\" and walked right past me, towards an employee. I actually kinda/almost started crying (because he was sorta raising his voice a bit, and that's my first reaction. I can't help it and I don't know why it happens)",

Most stores have different levels of employees wear different tops;  the higher up you are the more formal your uniform will be (usually).  Customers know this and generally try to seek out the most experienced looking person on the floor when they want advice on something.  Especially during the holiday season when people are already flustered and don't want to spend any more time than is absolutely necessary in those crowded shops.  I really really don't think this was<b>  sexism</b>.  I really really think people just labelled you as an inexperienced, junior level, young, shy employee and assumed that the men working were mor<b> e senio</b>r, more knowledgeable, had been working there longer, etc.  Now, those assumptions could be based <b> on sexi</b>sm, but I really think in this instance they were based mostly on you having <b> the<b>  ye<b> l</b</b</b>>>low t-shirt instead of the official uniform.. combined with other things I've mentione<b> d li</b>ke age and shyness.\n\nIt does suck to be in these kinds of situations though, regardless of the underlying reasons.  I'm sure you'll find as you get older and gain more work experience that you are treated differently.  Shitty situations do still happen though, especially in retail.  Hugs and empathy from me!",

Just shows how soft progressivism made millenials. I genuinely hope the newer generations wont be filled with people that get triggered by this type of shit",

When the Wii Fit was huge I had this girl who I had previously went to highschool with and wanted to either purchase the Zumba game on either the Xbox One or Wii at the time.  After explaining the differences she looked me right in the face, already had made up her mind and said, \"i don't think you know what you're talking about.\"  She really wasn't looking for an opinion.  She just wanted the Wii Fit version and that was it.  :/",

Honestly its something which just confuses me that in 2018 we're still having the same sterotype from the 1980's crop its head.\nIf somebody is working in a Video-Game store, you can assume they know some video game knowledge, doesn't matter if they're 18 or 60, male or female or whatever.",

But if a customer complained to a manager about it, we also got told off for that so it was almost like a no win scenario. I used to hate jumping on people as soon as they entered the shop because you could tell people weren't comfortable with it but if i didn't, I would be warned :(",

Our government refers to domestic violence as \"mens violence against women\", we have several extremely severe laws that discriminate against men, officials within the domestic abuse field once kidnapped a young woman; drove her around sweden and finland while keeping her locked up for her \"own safety\" and scaring her with how they were being hunted by a pedophilia ring run by \"men\",  not a big deal until you realize some of the people responsible STILL WORK FOR THE GOVERMENT!!!, the same group of people(radical feminists) also spread mass hysteria within Sweden about \"men\" kidnapping and sacrificing babies in Satanistic rituals to the point where it was a national hysteria and the police around the country would invest serious resources investigating, they also refereed to men as \"animals\" and yes they're still around today \"helping women\" from the horrors of ALL MEN, we had numerous \"psychiatrists\" and feminists manipulate their children in an epidemic of false molestation testimonies(thankfully this never got out of hand \"too much\"..), our version of metoo was so out of control an innocent man was driven to kill himself by our media, not to mention various horrible murders,<b>  witch</b> hunts by hordes of young \"feminists\" on social media doxxing and harrassing various innocent people, homes being vandalized, and the acceptance of abuse against men; i can't even count how many times women have hit and even molested me (both strangers and friends)... i could go on all day but i think you get the idea, and it's not because they're \"bad people\" it's just that the narrative is so fucking twisted in sweden that they don't see anything wrong with it and see no reason to reflect on themselves.\n\nI understand the need to defend something people view as good, but we need to realize that when we defend any label it tempts people to do bad things while telling themselves they're good because they belong to something people think of as good, it becomes a shield they can hide behind and no amount of \"not real feminism\" is going to change that :/, the label from my point of view does a lot more harm today than good, at least in the west.\n\nIf you think defending a simple word is worth it, give it some more thought.",

I had already ordered it on Amazon. But when I left some man ran down the street after me to ask if I had just tried the 3DS at Game. I said yes and he responded with \"Well they are selling it cheaper at Game Station\" and went on trying to pitch Game Station to me even thought they are essentially the same shop. I asked if he was from Game Station and he denied it but a few weeks later I saw him working at Game Station. No wonder Game Station is just Game now, they get employees to run after people on the street.",

Just yesterday I overheard a customer whining about how the store I work in didn't have any of the 4 packs of Egg Custards (If anyone doesn't know what they are, look them up, they're delicious) and because they were cheaper than 2 of the 2 packs she was asking if she could have the 2 separate packs for the same price as the 4 pack, my colleague handled it well, called a manager to check for this customer, and when my colleague got off the phone she apologised and said that the manager had told her that she couldn't reduce the price like that. So the logical response was clearly to get bitchy about how it's just not good enough and how she shouldn't have to pay more when it says that an offer is on, she complained that it was misleading advertising (It states the exact bloody product that is on offer) so yeah, some people are just <b> dumb.</b>\n\nAnother one I got was a customer handing me two vouchers yesterday, for which she had not spent enough to use them, so I checked and handed them back, apologising and making sure she knew that she hadn't spent enough to use them on the transaction, to which she started muttering about how ridiculous it was that she had to spend that much to use them (About \u00a35 more than she'd spent) but she was glaring at me as if I was ripping her off... Maybe if she'd... you know... used her bloody eyes and read the vouchers she might have known how much she needed to get, but that would be sensible...",

That'll have awesome skill-based combo action for all the boys and girls. The most hardcore fans have tournaments over who can play the way that looks the coolest. Dark Souls is good. Hard but fair. Don't let anyone scare you off. There's too many games to count honestly.",

What I do want to do is see if you can turn what happened here into something useful to you.\n\nYou just got a lot of flak about your views, which you probably view as true, reasonable, and as being opinions that you have a right to hold. So it probably sucked to read all that. \n\nWhat you can do to make this work for you is see that this is feedback, that strangers get the sense that you were acting accusative and rude. They see that and make assumptions about your character on the whole.\n\nYou have the power to change that by finding ways to talk about what's important to you in a way that comes off as less accusative and rude (or at least choose lighter topics until people get to know you better.) That would increase your chances of finding a girl who fits at least 1 of your 3 preferred attributes in a girlfriend (ie: being interested in you.) And once you've got at least one, you're closer to all 3.\n\nAll these replies are just strangers' words on the internet.

What if it was the other way around where the workforce was all males? Doesn't this invalidate the video you are commenting on? People disrespected her because she is working in a rather male inclusive sector. Also, the personality test is used by nearly everyone and the test doesn't really change all that much between companies. If the personality test truly weeded out individuals then you would see a inclusiveness form within the business. However, Google has many different communities within its company that function independently. As does every other company. One last thing, being skeptical is fine, but outright denying it and submitting your own \"truth\" is wrong as well.

I had really bad anxiety as it is and the whole situation of this didn't help it any. Not only did my store director who hired say, \"You can't call in sick or you're fired\", but dealing with all the people didn't help. Of course it's winter and people are coming in sick and of course I get sick. It was to the point I lost my voice and was panicking. I mean what was I suppose to do, my mom was nice enough to call the store(I was still living with my parents) and she read off what I was writing off. \n\nIt's bad enough he didn't care and basically said, \"He need to be here regardless or he's fired\", but he's being rude to my mom for trying to help me out. I did talk to the district manager who's basically he's boss and he got moved out of this store location and 2 months later \"retired\" from what I was told. I manage to get through that day thanks to my older sister who made this herbal drink from this book she had and allowed me to have a low raspy voice vs no voice. So thanks to her for that.\n\nI think the 2 and a half years I was there I had 3 total bad customers, every other customers were fine. They just wanted their stuff bagged, some a certain way, but no big deal and were on their way. So the first was this <b> weird </b>lady, I really don't remember what was triggering her, but she came up with 2 or 3 tomato's and I was just trying to find out if she wanted, \"Paper or plastic.\" After asking a few time she finally turned to me and glares at me for interrupting the \"conversation(yelling at him)\" cashier and says, \"I DON'T GIVE A ***, PUT IT IN ****** PLASTIC YOU LITTLE ****!!!\" \n\nI was taken aback, but just proceeded to do so. When she was leaving I just smile and said, \"Have a nice day.\" She turned and said, \"** YOU!!\" I never saw<b>  crazy</b> lady again while I worked there. \n\nSecond one wasn't really at me, but I was still in the general area and it was just odd. So there's a cafe in the store and they close at like 8pm and this person comes in at like 8:30pm. He pushed the button that calls for cafe services and one of the people who's cleaning up just says, \"I'm sorry we're closed.\" They get upset and as they leaving the employee says, \"Have a nice evening.\" and they basically get a rude gesture with a, \"Screw you.\" Me and my employee look at each other and just start laughing. I mean at this point I've gotten use to dealing with things around the store and didn't let too much bother me.\n\nThe last customer was around the holiday after I was hired, I was working the swing shift up til closing on Christmas eve and we're closing up for the evening. The manager hands the key off to one of the other Courtesy Clerks and he's a pretty short an<b> d skinn</b>y guy. So as he was trying to lock up the door this lady comes up to the door and was like, \"I need flour.\" He told her, \"I'm sorry we're closed for the night.\" This lady was determined to get the flour she needed. Before he could lock the door she forces it open and the poor guy had very little time, but manage to get out of the way and not be crushed in-between the door and rail the divided the in/out door. \n\nAs this was happening and she ran to the aisle the flour was on the night crew was maki<b> ng <b> r</b</b>>ed alert noise and sayi<b> ng, \"C</b>razy lady who need flour is on the war path for a bag of flour.\" They made more jokes about the whole thing as it was going on, to say the least, she got the flour and ran out. Like our managers that night were sitting at the cafe table watching this whole thing go on and were laughing the whole time. The rest of us ending up joining in and even the poor guy who almost got crushed couldn't help, but laugh at the whole event that transpired. Someone asked, \"Shouldn't we call the cops?\" \n\nThe two managers just ending up saying, \"Nah, it's like a 1$ bag of flour and I sure everyone just wants to go home and relax on Christmas.\"(They closed on Christmas back then). Anyway, that was really the worst of it. Sure we had our 911 emergency situations from time to time, but really beside the lady who was buying the tomatoes every other customer was tolerable. I did have a bit more stress around holidays, but looking back I think the good outweighed the bad. I left the job after my friend told me they were hiring where he worked and the pay was better. I went on my day off and due to ce<b> rtain </b>weird situation I was hired. This job wasn't bad at first, but I regret not leaving it in 2008-2009. \n\nI put to much of my health at stake with this job and the payoff wasn't worth it. After 10 years at this job I learned, never stick around at a job if it isn't worth it. Which I took the heart when looking for a new job. Was with a delivery job, unloading and sorting packages. After the first day I realized I wasn't in the physical condition to work such a job. Next day I went in, talk to the boss and told him, \"I'm sorry man, I thought I could've handle this job, but I can barely move after the one day. You and everyone here have my respect for what you go through though, but I'm going to have to quit.\" He was understanding, we shook hands, I said good-bye to the people I did work with and I left. \n\nIt sucks and I wish I didn't have to duck out like that only being there one day on the job, but I just can't do hard physical labor anymore after my last job. I'd tried going for a desk job, but basically I just don't qualify for them or places I tried when I call back after the interview(A week later) tell me they already hired someone else. So at the moment the best I can do is act as a caretaker for my parents. I don't enjoy having them pay me, but my mom is pretty much bed bounds and needs someone 24/7 and my dad really can't keep up caring for her on his own. It does have it's perks and the only stress is the lack of sleep or when my mom is having one of her bad day, but other then that it really boils down to just waiting until she need something. \n\nI know it won't last forever, but I want to try and let my mom continue to enjoy things. I try to get her out of the house in a wheel chair when she having a really good day and go shopping and stuff. I know how bored it can be get being stuck inside for weeks if not months on end, but I try to find her something to occupy her time from books to anime to movies. I'll talk to her for a bit, but I'll find out a bit into the conversation she has fell asleep. It always sad seeing her so exhausted <b> at h</b>er age, I mean being in her 60's and being like this is heart breaking. Anyway sorry about going on for so long, probably no one will even read this, but if you do thanks for doing so and I hope you have a nice day.",

I mean, I've only worked in an electrical  store for 20 years so I only have 20 years of experience of that first hand. Whereas you worked in GAME for one whole Xmas period. But then I come from a generation that knows that men and women are different whereas you come from a generation that thinks you can wake up one morning and be a cat if that's what you want.\n\nSecondly, what is a 'zee'? Is it like a zed for stupid people?\n\nThirdly, GAME stinks. No I don't want your insurance. No, I don't want your loyalty card. No I don't want any accessories. No I don't want to pre-order some crappy Switch game. Just piss off and give me what I'm trying to buy or I'm going back to the Internet.",

            "commentText": "I want to share a story with you. One time I went to, believe it or not, GAME to inform me of the \"new\" console at the time. I was looking the prices of the two consoles because, well they are priced a bit different. Mind you, I was a Nintendo kid, so I've never touched a play or any other consoles until the x-box came out. I didn't know what was the \"best\" one to buy for the price range, thus I went and stare very hard at the consoles to see what they have. A female employee ask me if I needed some help and I said \"actually, yes\". I asked a, somewhat, technical question and, believe it or not, she stared at me and said what the box said. Obviously that didn't answer my question, so I asked her again phrasing it a bit differently. The thing is, I'm from Mexico and I have a USA accent (guess why), thus I was a bit worried that I didn't phrase it correctly... but I did it. She glared at me with a face that said \"I already told you\" while repeating it again.  She asked me, \"any thing else?\", I said, \"no thanks\" and keep looking at the consoles. \n\nWhat she did afterwards was unbelievable: she went to one of her coworkers and told him what <b> dumb </b>and nerdy I was, it was just a console. Her coworker asked her what was the question and she said to him my question from A to Z. He looked at her and said to her \"go and catch a break\" (or something like that). He approached me very nicely and asked me if I have a doubt. I asked him my question and he told me the answer that I was looking for.\n\nTo make thing worse, that happened to me two more times (without the rude part) with female employees at game stores. So, what was the moral of the story? Ask google before going to a store.",

I'm so sorry you went through this. I still remember my days at Game so fondly, it was such a fun job while I was at uni. Sure there were bad customers but I was never discriminated because of my <b> sex,</b> and just as well because I would not have been able to handle it coolly the way you did.  Your story about the<b>  woman</b> who said to her husband to ask for one of the boys actually reminds me of stories my mum told me about from her youth. She used to notice that if she was speaking to a couple about a sale, th<b> e woma</b>n would always look extremely prickly and sour if she was talking to the bloke, even if the product they were looking for was clearly for the husband/boyfriend. So, my mum changed her tactic and started looking and speaking directly to t<b> he wom</b>an, and she said she noticed a huge difference. The edge would disappear and they'd be smiling at her. She realized that these women were clearly threatened by her, which was ridiculous, and so by talking just to the women it seemed to ease them up a bit.... But this was back in the early 80s! I can't believe this nonsense would still be going on....",

Usually, anyone can do these transactions but someone in store has been messing up so for a while only supervisers and above could deal with them. Two men and a boy came in with one so I had to call my superviser to do it, then one of the men roughly stated (my memory is a bit <b> fuzzy </b>on the actual words)\n\"Ahh, looks like you need a man to help you do it, this is why men are better, isn't that right boys\". The other two nodded and agreed with him. I thought he was joking around so I just faked a smile and laughed. Then he said \"That's also why men are always in charge, to make sure everything goes right. You can't trust a<b>  woman</b> to be in charge\"\nTo that I just responded, \"our superviser may be a man but our manager i<b> s woma</b>n and does very well without the aid of men\" (Well that's what I responded in my head 10 minutes later). Anyway, my superviser arrived and I walked away to calm myself.",

She is telling personal stories about her experiences, which don't happen to include genital mutilation, for obvious reasons.

I'm fact, I bet when you get a flat tire or stub your toe, you scream \"GENITAL MUTILATION!\" at the top of your lungs, right?",

One thing i don't get about modern feminism is how they only focus on problems in the west and never address the middle east who genitally mutilate women, forbid women from driving cars, and enforce oppressive laws upon. Instead the modern feminist encourages these behaviours?! Like i get that people can still have sexist opinions but systematic oppression of women is minimal and I would even go as far as say women are more privileged than men at this point. Like i get that she has experienced sexist remarks and all but to see comments in this comment section say oh this is the most sexist thing i have seen or make this seem much more horrible than it is kind of pisses me off. Compared to the shit my grandmother had to deal with it just doesn't seem that oppressive or in general bad considering i have seen this kind of customer behavior many times while out in public.",

You should've known from the start when you were evaluating the job that rude and offensive comments would be apart of it. (Don't like using the word \u2018offensive' because of it's coronation with being a privilege prick, but yeah.. it's just a word.) When ppl say 'The customers are always right.' They're actually saying 'Don't do anything that could lessened the chance of them returning.' What I'm trying to say is that you did a good job, in not doing anything about it. Except making this video, but you're a millennial so I'm probably setting the bar to high for you at this point. You're just trying to entertain I guess, or you're trying to spread a message full of BS. I can't mind read, so I wouldn't know which one it is.\n\nLastly sorry for saying my opinion and mansplaining everything to you, or maybe it isn't mansplaining. I'm not a man, just as you said a member of the challenged Z-Gen XD",

A customer, of what i believe she was a middle aged variety,  so the customer asked for a wallpaper that would suit their study and showed me a picture so I stood there and though about it and they suddenly said \"Oh what would you know about this sort of thing. I'll find a female member of staff.\" I was like \"Oh... oh well\" I carried on with my business of sorting displays and stuff. Then a female work colleague approached with a customer, the same customer, she said \"You're good at art and that stuff. What do you think would work well with this ladies room.\" and the customer looked at me and said \"I tried him before it's hopeless.\" So I quickly said \"White background lavender plant pattern... on one side facing away from the window... the other walls painted the same white as the background of the wallpaper... Light amount... enough for wallpaper... to stand out... looks unique and fashionable. Works well with your desk and window plants.\"\n\nSo I just went straight back to what I was doing and my colleague took her to get the things I listed. She was walking away like \"Oh, he must be <b> gay<b> .</b</b>>\" I was just so annoyed... I felt so useless because I felt like I wasn't supposed to know or do anything other than blindly stack shelves like a simple machine and tell people to find someone else.",

I was served by a women, around my <b> age.</b> She was phenomenal, ran me through all the upgrades that comes with a pro, the games I'd get and some extra stuff that I didn't actually know. How people can think<b>  gender</b> affects a job like this is beyond me. I get the stigma of guys being the gaming geeks but if someone works in a store unless they're new you can expect them to know most of the same knowledge as anyone else. Either way good video!",

Hell, with my experiences, if you walk into a game stop, you're more likely to see a girl working the cash register. (there are dudes, but weirdly enough, when I walk in, they're just now coming out the back)\n\nYou still got the rude-as-shit people, yes, but.... it's less likely you'll find them because NYC is surprisingly enough the nerd + geek capital of the whole damn world XD",

If the guy(s) in question specifically asks me why, I just look at th<b> e woma</b>n saying \"Oh, I'm sure she's got her reasons.\" or, \"beats me,\" or \"I'm just a girl\", or just \"I don't know nothin' bout nothin'\", or, \"my lady brain can't possibly help with this lady's question/issues, do you mind assisting the (young/polite/wonderful/lovely/gracious) little lady, kind sir?\"\n\nI've had a few women catch onto what I was doing, and tried to \"school\" me about the \"way of things\", or \"who do I think I am\", but I just politely asked them to also get me a male to help explain it further. Shiteating grin included. \n\nIf the women are more feisty and react in kind with a snippy attitude, or even outright say that I have a \"problem\", I am more than willing to play t<b> he du</b<b> >mb wo</b>man who doesn't know anything... because.. that was your first assumption... wasn't it? Precious? Cock head. Smile. Watch them smack their lips and leave. One \"professio<b> nal\" w</b>oman even wanted to brawl in the parking lot, office suit and all, because she knew I pointed her out for her buffoonery, and she got even less info from the men she thought would help her out better. She could have gotten my help, however, the person who didn't mind my help got the deal that slipped right through her fingers because she wanted to pull that mess. And I made SURE she knew it too (while speaking in my ob<b> vious</b> dumb-blonde sarcasm voice)  She lost an opportunity to save 55k that day. Oh well lady, you missed out saving 55 grand and got no help, no newer knowledge, no new connections or networkings, and you snoozed and lost while pulling your stunt. Bye...and take your bias with you. I'll be sure to give you a wave and a twitched-nosed blink and smile if you glance back my way with your bared teeth before you let that door hit you on your ass. \n\nMost women like this just give me a death glare combined with a look like they just ate a lemon coated in Warhead sugar. I know why some women do this, and I'll give you a hint, it's not often the case that they think the guy knows more either. I am MORE than willing to act like an even bigger asshole than they are. In those cases, I was nice, smiled, was professional, took time out of my day and was willing to spend my time, resources and knowledge in a certain field to help you out, and you're just going to act like that doesn't matter,  treating me all dismissive...treating me like that over something I can't control. Sometimes even trying to humiliate me for your own amusement in front of your guy friends. Oh, no. It's O-WN. Berserk button pushed. Seriously. Fuuuuuuck- ah- youuuuuuu-ah. XD",

To be fair, growing up she wasn't allowed to even touch technology, her parents thought learning how to type was useless and that girls should learn home ec, sewing and cooking and such.  Her father didn't even want her to finish school.  After internalising those messages it's hard to break free of them.  \nIt's the same for men a lot of the time.

Egalitarianism is broad, and while linguistically it is a movement, it doesn't actually have activism directly attributed to it, so it has no momentum.  There wasn't and isn't a term for feminism besides feminism. \nFeminism was never a belief, it's always been a movement, and that's why it's important. It isn't passive, and it exists to create change. \nThe hate it gets is really just misattributed fear. If you espouse any ideals regarding equality of the sexes, you're going to be labeled a <b> feminazi </b>and get hate anyway.\n\nI understand why people want to identify as egalitarians instead of feminists, but often it just impedes progress. It isn't helpful to demonise the movement that's making change, while support one that is essentially equivalent, but without momentum. It is far better to be a part of the feminist movement, while remaining critical of its weaknesses, so that you can play a part in guiding it to the right destination.  \n\nLauren is really on the right track with that.",

People don't have a bad opinion of egalitarianism because it's a simple righteous belief, and i'm willing to say ALMOST all of Americans actually believe in it. Thats why it isn't a movement. \n\nFeminism doesn't have that luxury anymore, because the movement had basically made men into their enemy, thereby already turning away half the population. And it's hard to go back after hearing radical feminists both talk about killing all men and putting men and zoos only to keep alive to breed with. \n\nOBVIOUSLY THESE PEOPLE ARE <b> CRAZY </b>AND DO NOT REPRESENT MOST OF FEMINISTS (I can find links to feminists saying this if you'd like).

                    "commentText": "+Thad Henry\n\nNo offence, but this is a horrible line of reasoning that doesn't hold up. There are Muslims who are terrorists, this does not make Islam reprehensible. The Westboro Baptist Church exists, this does not make Christianity difficult to support. There are very outspoken racists and KKK members that support the Republican party, this does not make Republicans unelectable. The reason for the terrible feeling surrounding the feminist movement is not radical feminists. Radicals always exist. The problem plaguing feminism is the well-intentioned people who choose to only focus on the non-issue of the radicals, instead of the very real issues that people are facing. \n\nThis is just an optics issue, getting suckered into a zeitgeist. Feminism has not made men into their enemy, it is actually doing a great deal for men, and is probably the only movement that seeks to help men. It is responsible for the attention that men's <b> mental </b>health is getting, and it is challenging the way we impose unrealistic ideals of masculinity upon men in a way that leads such<b>  mental</b> health issues. It is opening up our right to express ourselves the way we want. Egalitarianism isn't doing that, because it's really just a label people call themselves to say \"I'm not a bad guy\", not a movement people take action under. You can cherry pick a minute subsection of the group and heavily publicise it very easily. You can spark outrage and get clicks doing this, and inciting anger really is the best way to get attention and ad revenue. But the truth is, those people don't represent the group because they chang<b> e nothin</b>g. It doesn't matter if a bunch of feminists say to kill all men, because frankly, no one's doing that. There is no law defending it and there never will be. \n\nHowever, in blocking the progress of a movement by undermining the work that positive feminists do (the ones that actually DO make change), you aren't doing anyone any favours. You aren't changing the impression people have of those who tackle gendered issues, you're simply straw-manning a huge swathe of people and inciting outrage without actually changing anything. \n\nThe only change that really occurs is regressive. It opens up discussions for women returning to a disempowered state, which we're seeing all over the place now - and it's blamed on feminism as though it incited the backlash, when in reality, the backlash was incited by outrage journalism.",

It's just an honest debate.\n \nAnd I do wholeheartedly agree that an organization, or in this case a movement, should not be overly criticized by the actions of their most radical members, every example you bring up being a great one.\n\nAnd while I don't hate all feminists because of the actions a few of them have taken, very few people are as tolerable as you or I. And the effect caused by the radicals has permanently left a distaste that many others will not overlook.\n\nAnd you are 100% correct it is an optics problem, people shall continue to view feminism as a bad movement to follow no matter how much it changes. The <b> yel<b> low<b>  </b</b</b>>>journalism that has followed feminism has corrupted it's view too much, but it still has it's truths too. But I despise modern journalism and news reporting, from fox news to CNN it's all political bullshit, watching either will trick you into one way of thinking, watching both just confuses a person.\n\nAnd I don't believe the idea of equality needs a movement, because they can do say as much as they want do as much as they want, try to get public officials to support their cause (Which just isn't smart, as soon as the political figures start to try to fix society in their own way there will be insta<b> nt <b> r</b</b>>ed flags and backlash)\n\nAnd feminism has already been blocked. With how it is perceived nowadays it doesn't have the support to change as much as it wants to.\n\nBut I can go ON and On about it's flaws but that isn't what helps. What would help is ideas to fix the problem.\n\nIf I were to fix the movement, I'd just create an entire new one. It's too late to fix the public view of it once it is as set in stone as it is.\nDitch the name, I'm sorry but the name feminism for what it's trying to support is quite stupid.\n\n\"Here let's promote equality but having the female pronoun!\" See the problem?\n\nI would change it to humanism, it just makes more sense. It's supposed to help everyone no matter<b>  the ge</b>nder. \n\nQuit the double standards that plague both sexes, if a man says they are just better<b>  than </b>woman, ofc call him out, (but if he says something such as, \"women on average are not as strong as men\" that's a fact that you can debate him on)\nWhile at the same time, call out the women who say \"*insert radical feminist quote*\" ESPECIALLY if they say they are part of the movement.\n\nHumanism is already a belief that all people are equal. So keep it both a belief and a movement.\n\nTackle real problems, don't become like Aniti Sarkeesian and try to ruin platforms of entertainment for people. If you feel there is an issure in gaming or movies, CREATE A MOVIE OR GAME THAT IS CREATIVE, ENTERTAINING, AND ADDRESSES THE ISSUE.\n\n Promote SUBTLE diversity, don't shoehorn diversity in like the Ghost bosters remake did\n\"Watch us because we are diverse\" just no.\nDo it subtly but noticeable. Have a line that flows through with dialogue but adds exposition.",

                    "commentText": "+Thad Henry \n\nI actually do very much agree with a lot of what you're saying here, especially the crux of what you're getting at. That said, I don't agree with feminism having been blocked, nor do I agree that it can no longer create positive change. Honestly, I've been on your side of the argument before, and I do get where you're coming from - but what made me change my position was entering the discourse myself. The truth is that when you see where feminism is actually discussed - on published papers and within fields where it is needed, not on <b> weird </b>articles on the internet from attention-seeking journalists and bloggers - it has a positive impact. I'm skeptical of creating a new movement, because honestly, it just continues to create divisions and historically that has never worked out. From all sides of the political spectrum. The left wing suffers in the UK from having itself be spread<b>  thin</b> across so many different political parties. The IRA suffered heavily from its constant splintering. I'm whole-heartedly for refining a movement based upon achieving its core principles, rather than simply ditching it due to mischaracterisation.\n\nThe real need for it to be a movement and not a belief is not to instigate changes in politics, but to instigate change socially. It's to challenge our views and to refine our attitudes, so that we can look at ourselves critically. Holding a belief is static, we keep them and they're rarely changed. Most people agree that women have equal value to men, but not everyone agrees with what standards men and women should be held to. Largely they don't even notice when they're holding them to different standards. \n\nThat said, I'm not against Humanism. I think it's a far more logical approach to the conversation than egalitarianism, because it actually does instigate change, and truthfully, it is divorced from a lot of problematic stereotypes. But there's also a principle that needs to be defended - a movement should not have to rebrand itself every time it's smeared. In my opinion, people really should adopt both banners. Doing so allows you to lead by example. Radical feminists are actually disempowered by the focus of feminism shifting to positive feminism rather than extremes, anyway. Divorcing feminism from positive values will really only give them the platform to co-opt the entire movement for themselves, and flooding the scene with that brand of feminism is going to catch on to young girls who look up to older feminist heroes. I really believe they should just be given less attention, and we need more examples of people willing to take the title of feminist and display it for what it is - and what it does. \n\nI do somewhat disagree with the Anita Sarkeesian point too, though. She didn't have the best approach, her reasoning was often weak, and she was really bad at dealing with the response. She was very unclear about what she was even trying to do. As much as I dislike her impact upon feminism, there was value in what she was attempting to do, however. Exposin<b> g sexis</b>m within video games should be done with the desire to improve them. So I'm actually in favour of criticising games from a feminist perspective - because in analysing them you can open up potential ways to improve upon the formula. The problem with Sarkeesian is that it really seemed like she picked up the topic without a desire to improve it, but just with the desire to point things out. But pointing things out is not a problem if it's done with a purpose.\n\nI don't think the trend of creating all-female casts and shallow female leads that ha<b> ve nothi</b>ng going for them other than being powerful women is a result of feminism though, honestly. I think that's just Hollywood trying to appeal to demographics that they just don't understand. I think a lot of feminists would find more holes in the presentation of women in some of those movies than some decades-old movies. It's sort of the same problem with journalism - just lazy attempts at gaining attention and appealing to the public without actually having to understand them. \n\nI absolutely do agree that diversity should really be explored for the narrative and not for the sake of some political appeal. \n\nHonestly though, I don't have any qualms with co-opting Humanism in lieu of Feminism. But I am always going to be against maligning feminism, which continues to be a positive force in society outside of article headlines and echo chambers.",

But most importantly, it's influencing the way we reach out to men struggling with depression from a medical perspective. \n\nThe fact that when men commit suicide, no one ever suspected they had any problems at all is disturbing.

It never makes the claim that <b> doctors </b>say \"who cares\" it suggests that it is very easy for women's<b>  mental</b> health problems to be attributed to their nature as women without being properly analysed (subconsciously or otherwise). They cite hysteria as an example. No doctor says \"who cares\" but some are wont to not give proper consideration to the issues, whether they realise it or not. That ISN'T a claim that women have it harder than men, though, it's just one aspect in whic<b> h menta</b>l health isn't taken seriously enough through the lens <b> of gend</b>er. In all likelihood, s<b> ome doct</b>ors are likely to handwave women's problems as a hormonal issue or poor self-control of their own bodies.\n\nPlus, it's fine to disagree with some claims. You haven't really produced a counter-argument to my point there at all, which leads me to believe that you've conceded that feminism does make change. You've just zeroed in on a very specific point you disagree with, which isn't actually part of my argument to begin with.\n\nAlso, just lol @ buzzfeed. It's precisely the type of journalism I'm talking about. Notice how many views it has and how many dislikes it has. It's selling outrage. If they wanted to actually reach out to people and build a positive fanbase, they aren't stupid. They know that videos like that won't cut it. But those videos do get clicks. No one agrees with them, not even the vast majority of feminists, and they know that. Anyway, I've already addressed the point of vocal minorities anyway, so this is really just a circular argument, since it doesn't bring anything new to the table. \n\nAlso, to xrelik, the problems with The Last Jedi is hardly purple hair.",

Because believe it or not humans from a physical pov are limited beings with limited resources. Women are much less physically strong than men and they are also less intelligent. As someone wisely said: women are the most responsible teenager in the house.  Feminist have shouted loud that they can do it, but from Rosie the riveteer until now they just continuously proven that no they cannot do it . You may say there are exceptions but I say those exceptions are extremely rare like unicorns, less than 1%.  But hey biological reality, <b> sexual </b>dimorphism and science in general are all part of the<b>  patriarchy</b> , right?",

This has not been my experience. \nAlso in terms of being bullied on the Internet, feminist figures get the worst kind of constant abuse including daily death threats and rape threats.  There are trolls who follow feminist pages just to write contrary statements and abuse the OP.  \nBut it is true that feminist mobs can also be incredible bullies.  I try call this out when I see it.  I do not condone it.  But I think humans in general will always gather in mobs to bully someone they think deserves it, wether because they look different, they wore something people disapproved of or because they did something to offend.  It's disgusting behaviour either way. \n\nFor those who have said we don't really need feminism anymore... check some of the above statements by this charming young fellow who has just outright stated he believes women are inferior beings created for making babies... now imagine there are still many people who still think this many more who still believe this on a subconscious level, who are on positions of power, who get to make decisions about how much women are paid, wether we get hired for that job, wether we get that promotion, wether we get paid as much as our male colleagues.  \nSure many laws now make discrimination illegal, that doesn't mean people won't let their own warped beliefs cloud their judgment.",

It was usually women who had come in with their son or boyfriend and didn't actually play games themselves. Because they didn't like games they couldn't comprehend that other females did and could be knowledgeable about them too. A few examples, one <b> woman </b>rang up and asked specifically to speak to a man, when I asked why she replied \"because they know more about this stuff\". Another<b>  woman</b> got into a huge argument with a myself and another female coworker. She thought we were lying about being into games, because \"games are for boys\". Had a few people insisting on waiting for male colleagues when I was free to help. My colleagues were cool about it though, one even said to a customer, \"sure, you can get served by me, someone who has only been working here a few months and doesn't actually play games or by my female colleague who has worked here for years, played games her whole life and happens to be the store manager.\"",

We employees were allowed to watch cinema movies for free during our breaks or when every cinema room is occupied. Mainly so we could provide information about current movies to customers without spending our free time watching them. In the evening, a group of <b> woman </b>came into the cinema and asked questions about the movie. I watched it a couple of days ago so my memory was still fresh and I started explaining the main plot of the movie without any spoilers until one of the<b>  woman</b> suddenly interrupted me and asked if I could find a female co-worker of mine to answer their questions. I asked why and she replied that I, as a guy, am unable to find joy in romantic movies and that I would be unable to capture any of the feelings in it, so my information and interpretations of the movie and my experience of the emotions in it weren't worth anything because I'm a guy. It was quit funny actually lol~",

I know that this doesn't relate to the stories in the video, I just felt like saying my opinion abou<b> t sexis</b>m in gaming and this is just my personal experience. My brothers, guy friends, and complete strangers have all talked down to me, said blatantly rude thing to me, or just refused to play with me because I'm a girl. When I use the voice chat in games I've been harassed and after I say one thing some guys legit leave the game. I know not every girl has experienced this but I'm just a bit sick of it. And yeah it was hard to get into it as a girl and I've talked to a lot of girls that say they want to play games but it's too intimidating so they just watch a playthrough instead.

            "commentText": "It's actually pretty funny. Cause I currently work at a Gamestop here in Texas. And I had a few instances like that. Although it wasn't directed towards me, but directed towards my Assistant Store Leader who was a Female. She was training me at the time, and told her to watch her interact with customers. So she walked up to a guy and ask what he was looking for after greeting him. The guy said oh <b> nothing </b>just looking around than walked off. My ASL came back and began to show me more stuff to learn. Than the guy came to me and wanted to ask some questions. So I came up to him with the encouragement from my ASL, and started answering some questions. However, he got mad when i didn't know about a certain game I haven't play yet. So I said I would get my manager to answer this one. When I got my ASL the guy said \"Oh I didn't ask her because I figure she wouldn't know since she's a girl.\" My ASL gave one of her \"smiles\" and started answering every single question the guy had about gaming leaving the guy dumbfounded. Pretty funny to watch",

Anyways, I was just scrolling through YouTube quite late at night (as you do-) and hey, <b> ho,</b> a very interesting video popped up on my recommended, and even more odd; it has \u2018game's' striking purple colour standing out. My mind was just like;; Wait. What. How. Why is the shop that pretty much fuels my life support on the cover of an animation video ?\u00bf? So I clicked on it, super excited that there was a British animator,,, and ohmygosh I loved the video- but when it came to the part with the young boy's thick Swansea accent, my heart leapt-!! I watched the rest of your videos, all of them, even though I only found out about you a hour ago. And as the<b>  cheesy</b> minecraft accounts say, I s m a s h e d that subscribe button (someone shoot me pleaSE) and l o v e all of your content, so hella much. And tbh, your account really inspires me. Before I had it stuck in my mind that if you wanted to be a successful animator you have to grow up in America or Canada- and I was just gonna grow up to be a super welsh mum sitting down bored as fudge watching young kids sing out of tune in an Eisteddfod. But now, there's a Welsh animator. D'know what that means, * I * could be a Welsh animator. Holy hell! But, anyways, I just wanted to say how incredibly talented you are and I can't stop watching your videos sndjdjjddjjd,,,, but, that's enough for now. You should just know how much I love you,, so- Diolch yn fawr, dwi ddim yn gallu fod yn mor hapus gweld arlunydd Cymraeg \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e (I dmed you this on instagram, but I'm not sure if you reply there so-??\u00bf)",

The first day\u00a0on the job I see\u00a0these guys are having a conversation behind the counter because in game <b> nobody </b>works. I thought I would walk up as a friendly dude and start chatting and the jack<b>  black</b> looking one turns to me and says '' Stack the shelves mate we're talking about havin<b> g se</b>x with Herbie the car '' So I start stacking in alphabetical order which is pointless since people don't put them back that way. I Remember this kid that would come in everyday and scream harry potter in my face. So after two weeks of unpaid work and the staff wondering if Donkey Kong would give a good blowjob. I lost it , The kid comes in and I just looked at him when he bought this popular game at the time I took his money and went '' Oh you die in the end of this after your sidekick betrays you'' then I went up to the guys and was like '' Maybe you should ask if the mirror would ha<b> ve s</b>ex with you , Because you can go and fuck yourself ''\u00a0After that I get sent on my fifteenth made up task of the day ( honestly they should of just sent my out for tartan paint and had their laugh) so I'm now playing inspector gadget trying to juggle 4 coffees, Two subways,3 bags , and a bunch of DVDs from outside back to the store . After all that they say well you have the job and then\u00a0hire\u00a0their mate instead . Who then takes the DVDs off me sits in the staff room and goes '' Do you think Stan smith would be a good lover'' . I learnt a valuable lesson that day when you're in a GAME store always ask for something you know the staff cant find.",

I was shocked, but did as he requested and placed a<b>  senior</b> member of staff on the phone to him. The guy asked, \"I need someone to help me with my PC, can you put on the most qualified person to help with PC's please\" and my colleague more than obliged and passed the phone right back to me. The customer was then the one in shock, told me the game and I helped him through his issue. He really was apologetic and in the end, I think he learnt not to prejudge.",

She then walked over to the nearest female member of staff, who just so happened to be on her first week with the store to ask her a question. That member of staff politely apologised, because she didn't know the answer, and proceeded to bring the lady over to me to ask. The look on the customer's face was priceless.",

As for the other side, <b> nothing </b>really happens. Everybody just looks at me weirdly because I don't like girly things AT ALL. One female cashier even told me that I shouldn't dress like that because I'll never get a boyfriend (I don't even care about that. She never asked me). As for sexist remarks from males... It never happened. Every bad thing thay said or done to me was personal and not because of my<b>  gender</b>. I would check discord or some other voice chat, but I'm <b> a puss</b>y.

GAMING IS <b> GENDER </b>NEUTRAL! the stereotype that games are for boys stems from the fact that some of the original gaming systems were sold in the toy isle of shops, which at the time were devided into boys and girls\n\nguess which side they picked\n\nTHIS DOESN'T MEAN GUYS KNOW MORE ABOUT GAMES?!

            "commentText": "I work at Game! My rudest customer was when a guy came in with his son. After I approached them the dad said the kid had some birthday money to spend on a second-hand Nintendo DS. \n\nWhat you need to understand at this point is that we are not some small family owned business, we have very little power to do anything and even our managers have their hands tied very tightly with a whole lot of things. The majority of the time, it's a head office issue, and completely out of our hands. We are a cooperation, not a corner shop.\n\nThe guy asked me the differences between the 2DS, and the slightly more expensive 3DS. After explaining the pros and cons of each, he asked his son which one he'd like. He wanted the 3DS, but wouldn't be able to afford any games unless he got the 2DS.\n\nThe dad asked me \"could you come down on the price a little?\"\n\n\"O, um, sorry but I can't... that's out of my hands I'm afraid.\"\n\nThe guy gave me a dirty look. He then helped his son decide between a 2DS with games, or a 3DS without. Eventually he asked me again.\n\n\"Come on mate, it's birthday money. Are you sure you can't budge at all?\"\n\n\"I understand your situation sir, and I sincerely appologise. But it's out of my control, not even my manager has the power to alter pricing. That's all head office's department\".\n\nNow, clearly angry, he turns to his son and says:\n\n\"Sorry, if the man's gonna be mean and obviously not care, then you're going to have to choose\".\n\nUm... excuse me? I JUST told you I don't have that kind of power! I'm not being difficult, you're asking me to dig a hole without a shovel here!\n\nEventually the kid decided on the more expensive 3DS, and his dad begrudgingly paid to get a game for the kid as well. He made sure to make a scene through the whole process though.",

Except one time at Game Huddersfield...\nSo Disney Infinity 3.0 had just released so a few days after I went out to buy it with my parents. The queue was massive that day and after 45 minutes of waiting we got to the front of the queue...and it wasn't in stock so my dad said \"Why the hell is it out on the shelf then?\" And the girl behind the till said she didn't know, I had also picked up a world pack as well. And she asked me if I still wanted to by that and I think that set my dad over the edge, I can't quit remember what he said but it was something like \"Well isn't that bloody great! Also why the hell would he want to buy the add on pack of he can't buy the sodding game!?\" At that point he took us out of the store. I was so embarrassed... I apologise on his behalf to the poor lass behind the till that day",

He just asked me if I was going to play it.\nWell of course I am going to play it! Why do you think I'm buying it? To look at it?!\nWas he expecting me to say 'Nah, it's for my boyfriend.' Or something like that.\nI just really hated the surprised way he was talking to me as he did the transaction. I left feeling a little annoyed.\nOther then that, all my other experiences at GAME have been really good.",

Like you can be a dick to me all you want but even tho I'm depressed I still bet my life is 10 times better than yours so check mate. Only if the same person has continously bullied me every day for months I will eventually break down but for just a one time instance it shuldn't bother you that much, so yeah, work on ur self worth mate.

And even my coworkers, at least the men, as they would just laugh off my complaints, but that's a whole other rant. ANYway. I expected the male customers to give me grief. But when the women did it, I wanted to slap them across the face and be like, I AM TAKING YOU SERIOUSLY. A MAN WILL NOT. And more often than not, my male coworkers never knew what the women wanted/needed. I did manage to convert a few women and even had a few regulars who loved coming to me BECAUSE I was a <b> woman </b>in a male dominated department. A lot of the younger male customers like me, too, as did a lot of the older ones. It was the middle ground customers that gave me grief. I loved learning new things from the older ones, as they helped me grow without criticizing my lack of skills in some things. I'm still not sure how smart it was for this one pair of morons who heckled me while I was driving the fork lift, as I was on a piece of heavy machinery and labouring under just a big enough case of the Fukits to spear them and declare the murder charge worth it. On the flip side of that, many of the truck drivers I unloaded product for complimented my skills and said I was better than my male counterparts. When you think about how many people these guys have seen unloading trucks, it's a big deal to be praised. And no, they weren't being sarcastic at all (I'd asked). I had more good than bad in the time I was there, but gods, when the bad was bad, it was BAD. So I feel you.",

And there I've been taught to use a big paint machine that is used to tint different paints to basically any color you might want. I've had some customers there, men and women, to ask me \"if I know any men who know something about the paints.\" And though I very politely tell them that I am here to serve them, they relentlessly try to get a man to listen to their problems. Only after I tell them that all our male workers are currently busy in the electronic isle, they trust me with their questions. And they've been surprised that I actually know how to use the big paint machine and give them some good advices considering the paint they want.\n\nNot once has anyone come back complaining about the paint I've sold them. And I think that's relatively good considering I've never had any education on paints, other that what I've learned by watching and listening my colleagues and sometimes asking them some things. I've never actually even painted anything myself, if watercolors in childhood don't count, so there's also that.",

But my stepfathers new customers do not see her like that, all they do is check her out and make remarks to my step-dad about his office lady (real awkward doing that to the person she is in a relationship with tbh). When he would leave her in charge to go down the road to do things sooooo many people would walk in, go to ask her for help, realise my step-dad isn't there, say something along the lines of \"you won't know what I am talking about anyway...\" and leave! They would ring back later to ask to speak to my step-dad, what the hell. \nNow my best friend of 14 years has an engineering qualification, but so many people will not hire her because she is female. She is helping out my step-dad at his workshop just to gain experience and has already seen firsthand how sexist customers can be. Yet again customers will make sly remarks about how they think my friend is attractive (she is a 21 year <b> old </b>with curves, and has a boyfriend, the customers are older than her parents). She has also dealt with customers ignoring what she is saying and her advice and gone straight to my step-dad, or waited for him to be free so they can bug him and he can tell them exactly what she just told them. My friend has fixed so many things that have had my step-dad stumped for a while, yes he has had his workshop for over 20 years, doesn't mean he is an expert. He accepts this and will ask my friend for her ideas in front of the customers so they can see that yes, my friend actually knows her shit when it comes to engineering and mechanics. \nI guess when going into a male dominated field, you can never win, there will always be that slight bias, which sucks. \nIn my field there isn't the<b>  gender</b> bias, bu<b> t ag</b>e bias, people would rather have someone in their late 20s teach their kids English. I am just as qualified and have a lot of previous teaching experience, and I am only 21. \nOverall, it is frustrating having to deal with people having a bias and a stereotype of what people working in your field should be like.",

What I personally find sexist is that you seem to be assuming this of ALL women. Not all women are like this and that way of thinking is what keeps them from getting hired. Some women just remain single in their life and not even dream of having children. Besides, maternity leave only lasts a temporary time, it's not like women is going to produce babies like a factory, especially now since birth rates have started going down and women birth less.  Also, that traditional family thing is bullshit. While it will work on a lot of people, it won't work on everyone and women who do want to have a chance to work don't get it. Also, while this idea may seem farfetched to you some women do want to work while men stay at home. I've seen it happen, my parents have seen it happen, it happens.",

I agree with what you're saying, however I do believe that the other setups can (and do often) work. I would also be careful about a one size fits all approach. Quite often one salary is not enough to raise two children and two parents. Sometimes both parents have to work, so whilst the nuclear family is ideal, it is not always feasible.",

Besides, the point I'm trying to make is that because of these ideals, women who do go against the grain and want to go into these fields have it way harder because of this kind of bullshit. And for your information, birth rates going down is good, it's good for the overall economy and the rest of the population. Like, did you not study this? If a country's birth rate is lower, then the people live longer because the more children a family has the poorer they are. These are actual facts scientists and demographists have studied and are not bullshit percentages like \"when the man doesn't work and the <b> woman </b>does 50% of marriage ends in divorce\". It's already bullshit cause of that percentage, where did you even get that from? Google? Or did you just pull that from your ass based off of your \"observation\". Look, I completely get when you say when women aren't interested in STEM or other men related things. It's true, a lot of women aren't. But what I'm arguing about is there are also some women who are interested in STEM and even though in some cases these women are more qualified than men since they've had to work harder to even get into it, they're denied because they're chosen over a man. It's the point of this video. Clearly, she's just as much qualified to help these customers since she knows what she's doing but she's shut down for being a<b>  woman</b>. She's looked down upon for being <b> a woma</b>n. She's put into a box labelle<b> d \"wom</b>an, cannot help go look for a man\". And tha<b> t's sex</b>ism.",

Hence why they are generalisations.\n\nNo one is arguing for equality of outcome. The issue is equality of opportunity. As you correctly pointed out, women are held back by sexist assumptions. This makes it harder for some women to enter careers that they are passionate about and makes it harder for them to receive promotions.\n\nThe people who say \"men and women should be equal\" often come up short when putting this principal into practice.

If people find themselves unable to support kids relatively easily in terms of finance then choice is simple, DONT HAVE KIDS, as u said you have to think of child development.\n\nbooby ranger -  yes equality of opportunity and rn for STEM subjects women are favored over men, so women have all the advantages but still barely want to or can even do those jobs. if women are turned off careers they are \"so passionate about\" by irrelevant little comments then they arent really passionate about it at all.",

But yeah, it's really hard to be taken seriously as a girl working in a video game shop sometimes, and people can be really rude about it right to your face.\nI mean when it comes to consoles I probably know more than anyone else who works in the shop, I got the job based on my knowledge of them, but I still get people shaking their heads at me while I'm trying to explain the difference between the different PS3 models, and asking if they can talk to a man.\n\nAgain though, to anyone from CEX here, never had a problem with the members of staff themselves, they've always been very accepting and friendly.",

He'd recommended me to the store manager (thanks bro). Things were pretty great... for the first few weeks. I think it was like week 3 when I actually thought my body was going to shut down during the second hour of my shift. Here's a list of all the things That happened in my terrifying Christmas temp placement: \n1. I got called the c word because we didn't have 6 \u00a3400 record players in stock (this guy wanted 6 of them for some reason) \n2. A kid literally pissed in the shop whilst his mum filmed him \n3. A <b> woman </b>with like 800 kids refused to leave after her kids knocked over a display \n4. A customer kept trying to bash his way into the \u2018staff only' door because he wanted to see if we were lying when we said we didn't have an item in stock \n5. A 6ft guy with swastika tattoos up his arms threatened another temp on the till beside me whilst I cowered in fear \n6. We all had to evacuate due to a fire in the Wagamama next door.",

While taking carts inside of the store I heard a few <b> elderly </b>ladies ask \"Why do they always have the 'little girl' do this job?\".

It's so sincere and I find myself relating so much to what you say even though we are from completely different demographics!  Taking a job you like, the craziness that is the Overwatch chat, overzealous store employees, and even difficulty understanding what some children are saying are all things I can totally understand, especially given the chill way you describe them!  \n\nWhen you were talking about that first lady who walked away from you, I was literally thinking \"well if she won't follow me to the Turtle headphones I guess I'll just have to take the Turtle headphones to her!\"  And then you did that exact same thing!  This is the first video of yours I've seen and I'm seriously impressed and entertained. Thanks for this little slice of life, I seriously can't wait to see more!  Please keep it this real in future videos!",

Yes I a 19 year<b>  old</b> female that has changed batteries out of so many things over the years couldn't possibly know how to do that. To be fair she literally did not know how to put batteries into a remote, but you know to assume that only because I am female I wouldn't know how wa<b> s craz</b>y to me. She did let me show her how, and she did seem really shocked that i knew how to do it.

I even had a <b> woman </b>hell at me for recommending \"girl\" games even though that's what someone asked for and my general policy is that games are for all people of all kinds the subject matter doesn't matter as long as you like it. Obviously I've never been looked down on for being a male gamer, but I find it odd that people would've of still thought girl gamers don't exist I mean most of my friends I game with are girls.",

Many of these games can easy to spot because of the box being adorned with pinks and purples and has a girl or something  \"cute\" on the front. Usually they highlight specific girly activities.

Like symmetra doing 120dps at stage 3, making every second count. And spreads like sombra have like 4(?) Damage per bullet in a round of 60 bullets. However, in fortnite, the damage of spreads is random from 6-223 instead of having fixed damage, it uses RNG. RNG is fun and all in something like fire emblem(except 6, 2, and 15), but not a FPS that shouldn't relt on RNG as a core game design.",

Also my name is considered primarily female in English and French, so having part of my gamertag be my name really created some funny stories from that since everyone just assumed I was a girl since I never voice chat in game to prove otherwise \ud83d\ude02, so I know how <b> sexism </b>feels gaming wise, just in a backwards kind of way.

For example older female relatives of friends who are in other non STEM majors technically (<b> old </b>way of thinking and seeing STEM as a pre-dominantly male thing back in the day?). Some of the things I'm told are honestly just stupid and hence it \"usually gets laughed off\" like I said. Most of them happen when they go to visit each other when the semesters are over (I did mention it was my major, not yet my profession, still a couple more years till I get my masters degree in mechanical engineering). Though a decent amount of older female professors do say that is the case with them as well also with women of their<b>  age</b> and they do get bothered by it too, it's the types of thing teachers use as stories in class from their past and daily life to make a joke about it and lighten up the mood in class. It may be a<b> n ol</b>d way of thinking but even as a bad joke, STEM is still dominated mostly by a male population and hence it will take a while for this mindset to die out (both literally and figuratively speaking). Hope this clears up any confusion.",

Not long ago in Australian Parliament there was a discussion on allowing pepper spray & other self defence items to be used & decriminalised in Australia due to public safety concerns from Women & Men, about the recent attacks that have happened. One Lady Representative of the Greens Party said \"Women wouldn't need pepper spray if men weren't rapists\" (Blanket statement, implying all men are rapists {How you could interpret that any other way, I do not seriously know} & highly disrespectful to the law abiding, decent men in Australia, which make up the majority 98%). To make matters worse a Male Representative from the Liberal party responded with \"Well stop shagging men then\". The media slammed him  for his comment & demanded he apologise, yet  her comment was apparently fine. I'm ashamed that either of them are still in Parliament & haven't been sacked. But the obvious double standard on who was in the wrong, just makes me depressed & want to give up on Society entirely, some times.\nThe Suffragists would have my full support if they still existed, however the Suffragettes & their descendants (Feminists) definitely would not. Suffragists let men join their fight for equal rights & did so peacefully, with Respect & Honor. The Suffragettes were Militant Anarchists who wanted men to grovel at their feet & usually did absolutely insane things to get attention. This made it very difficult for the Suffragists to be taken seriously & actually delayed Women getting the vote by several years. Also the first action of most men after they themselves finally got the vote, even as commoners (was reserved for Lords only until 1918 in UK & 1902 in AUS), was to push for their Wives, Mothers, Sisters & Daughters to get the vote too. Does not sound like an oppressive worldwide <b> Patriarchy </b>to me, it sounds like progress against class discrimination.\nMy point is, we will never solve the problems we have by blaming others & playing victim. We need to call bullshit what it is, regardless of who it's coming from & let<b>  nothing</b> be held at a double standard. A sexist comment is a sexist comment,regardless o<b> f gende</b>r.<b>  A raci</b>st comment i<b> s a rac</b>ist comment, regardles<b> s of </b>race.\n@thats true\nSorry for the rant. Not aimed at you, just general venting & a little context, for the last half/second paragraph. It just gets so frustrating some times.",

I also know from my experiences from working in a supply store that I, as a young staff member, didn't like to be asked where stuff was. That was mostly because my job was to fill the racks, and helping customers was part of my job too, but it kept me from my main task. If I didn't finish that task in time, my boss would be angry with me, no matter how many customers I helped.

It wasn't a game store though - it was like all kinds of tech including PCs, consoles, TV's, kitchen stuff etc.\nAnd there was this one female employee in the fridges section. She was pretty much an expert in that area but most customers would ignore her and look for a male employee. ANY KIND. Even if he's working in TV section and just by looking at him you can say that he knows <b> zero </b>about fridges.\nSo yeah Amy. I know exactly what are taking about.",

There is no such thing as gynocentric society! Maybe historically or on a small tribal scale but not anywhere else. The word 'gynocentric' itself is not even correct. Just another case of people pretending that its possible to switch power dynamics in society around, solely in order for men to play victim to modern times. Sad lol. Open a random anatomy textbook, you'll most likely see a male.  Male driven narrative is found in most forms of media and in classic literature alike. Western civilization was built around the Greco-Roman culture, which was sexist, combined with christianity, which was even more sexist.    Women do not run worlds biggest religions. Medicine centers around men. Women die because people do not know that a heart attack in a <b> woman </b>may manifest itself differently than in a man. And so on. I could literally go all day.",

I had it ingrained into me that i am never allowed to openly Express my feelings as it will be seen as a sign of weakness and other men will tear me up for even showing a single sign of weakness. When it get serious gash in my arm from an accident i have to hold back my tears and say everything is fine and just walk over to a hospital. I seriously don't understand what on earth us wrong with modern extreme feminists who say men can't be victims because their great grandparents were sexists. Like sins of the father much? Then there is the false rape accusations in which a mere accusation can ruin a man's life and his reputation. This is a serious problem in korea that men are directly avoiding women in fear of the #metoo movement. There are so many problems that men also face yet i don't see a single mainstream feminists calling for changes to these injustices. Instead what do they do. They shit men's issues conferences discussing high malr suicide rates, they shut down any attempt to create male domestic abuse shelters, and then claim that male nature is to kill their fathers and to rape their mothers. I used to be a feminist left leaning kid whose teachers would always ingrain in his head that feminism can do no wrong and that conservatives are all monsters who are out to destroy equal rights. But after seeing the shit femjnism has pulled it has jaded me to the point that i am now a right leaning centrists due to fear of how extreme feminism has become especially withe their vitriolic hate towsrds trump who previous to the 2016 elections was thoroughly loved by mainstream media.",

You, right now, are being judgey of other women. If you can't find numerous examples of women being open minded and supportive, you clearly aren't looking.\n\nWomen CAN be manipulative, women CAN be catty- but then again, so can men. In my experience,  the MEN around me have gossiped more than the women. Don't fall into the trap of \"I'm not like other girls.\" You ARE like other girls, and that's a good thing, because most girls are awesome human beings. If you find yourself surrounded by toxic people like the women you've described, maybe you should find another friend group.",

I work at an ice rink, and my basic job is to monitor on the ice (like a lifeguard, except for the ice, I look out for people who fall on the ice and may have received a concussion or other injury,) and I hand out rental skates to customers who don't have their own to use. Apparently it used to only have guys working there for a long time, so the second another girl and I were hired it was confusing to customers for some reason? I'm not hated for being a girl and luckily I've never received any sort of harsh sexist remarks like you have, but I can just low key see the confusion in the customers eyes, like- 'you're a girl?? Working here??' And other times they just blatantly don't believe me when I tell them about the skates, especially the hockey ones. Not too terrible, but I definitely feel you.",

If a majority of women work at claires and a minority at a game store, you're going to assume based on prior experience that she doesn't have the same experience as the men. Sure it's stereotyping and it's lazy, but to be fair, if 99/100 people acted the same way, are you going to judge each of the 99 on an individual level just for the sake of that possible 1's feelings, when you keep seeing the same exact outcome?",

I feel bad for her son. \n\nThe wife seems like one of those judgemental women who thinks if you don't do something her way, she'll judge your entire life. I like her husband though.
