She doesn't have the background, experience or credentials of her male contemporaries to be a pundit on male professional football. How can she? She hasn't been there and done it. <b> Nothing </b>to do with<b>  misogyny</b>.  I think most males are now heartily fed up with this PC pro feminist agenda being force fed into an essentially male environment. She wants to be a football pundit? let her stick to the WSL Out of her depth as a Sky PL football pundit. An embarrassing joke.",
