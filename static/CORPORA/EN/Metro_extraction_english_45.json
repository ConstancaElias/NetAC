        "postText": "We might be living in an era of gender fluidity, but there\u2019s still one question that you get asked constantly when you\u2019re pregnant. \u2018Do you know what you\u2019re having?\u2019', 'But it\u2019s a question that women might find themselves unable to answer, at least until later into their pregnancies, because there are calls from Labour MP Naz Shah to for the government to ban early gender scans.', 'Early gender scans, known as NIPT (non invasive prenatal testing) is an increasingly popular test that takes place between 8 and 10 weeks into pregnancy and can determine various chromosomal abnormalities as well as the gender of the foetus. They cost between \u00a360 and \u00a3200 and can be done at a clinic or even by post.', 'Finding out early what gender your baby is, and getting some reassurance about any potential health issues sounds like a good thing. But Labour MP Naz Shah stated on the Victoria Derbyshire programme that she believed that early gender scans were leading to a morally wrong practice of sex selective abortions, and should be banned. She said: \u2018NIPT (early detection) screenings should be used for their intended purpose, to screen for serious conditions such as Down\u2019s syndrome. The government needs to look into this exploitative practice and enforce appropriate restrictions.\u2019', 'Sex selective abortions are a tricky, emotionally loaded area. I\u2019ve written before about my belief that all women should be entitled to abortions, whatever their reason. But even if you do believe that sex selective abortions are wrong, getting rid of early scans is no way to prevent them.', 'On the NHS you can find out what gender your baby is at your 16 week scan, assuming that the sonographer is able to make out the genitals of the foetus. Abortion is still an option until 24 weeks. So either we remove the option entirely, force all women to wait until the 24 week mark. Neither of which seems fair.', 'There is also the distinct possibility that a couple who are desperate to avoid having a baby of a specific gender would go to extreme lengths to prevent it. A sex selective abortion at six weeks is arguably better than at sixteen weeks, or even later in the pregnancy. If a couple are determined not to give birth to a daughter, is not finding out earlier in the pregnancy really going to deter them?', 'In countries where gender scans are banned there is a real problem with baby girls being abandoned. So preventing women from finding out whether their baby is a boy or a girl arguably creates more suffering. A six week old foetus does not have a central nervous system and does not feel pain. An abandoned baby however, does.', 'Early scanning works differently from a 16 week scan. The process involves scanning the pregnant woman\u2019s blood for tiny bits of the baby\u2019s DNA. It costs around \u00a3150 and is only available privately. From scanning the blood the test is able to tell whether the foetus has any genetic issues such as Downs syndrome, and to tell the gender.', 'Pushing a woman to have an abortion against her will because of the gender of the foetus is, without question, wrong. But banning the option to find out what gender the foetus is will not prevent domestic abuse, stigma around giving birth to girls or pressure for women from some ethnic groups to provide sons.', 'Banning early gender scans to prevent a small minority of people from having sex selective abortions would be about as sensible as banning candles because they occasionally cause house fires.', 'There are genetic illnesses such as hemophilia which only occur in one gender. Knowing that your child is a gender which makes it possible for them to carry an illness means that the parents have time to emotionally and logistically prepare themselves.', 'Women have a right to know what is going on inside their own body. The idea that the government wants to control what a woman is permitted to know about her own pregnancy is, frankly, terrifying.', 'For many women, finding out the gender of the baby early (typically around the eight week mark) helps them to bond with the pregnancy. Early pregnancy is often filled with morning sickness, tends to deplete a woman\u2019s energy and the change of lifestyle required can come as something of a shock. So finding out the gender can help balance that feeling.', '\u2018I felt like I knew my baby so much better once I found out the gender\u2019 said Alex*, 32. \u2018I loved not having to call her an \u2018it\u2019 once I knew that she was going to be a girl, and it helped me to think of her as a person. The gender scan made me feel more prepared for motherhood.', '\u2018I was disappointed to find out that I was having a boy\u2019 said Kate*, 30. \u2018I had always pictured myself having a girl. It took a month or two to get used to it, finding new things to get excited about and shopping for little boys clothes. By the time my son was born I was delighted, and he is the center of my world. But I am so glad I found out early so that I could get used to the idea. It was how I needed my pregnancy to go.\u2019', 'Denying all women the option to find out what gender their baby is is akin to keeping the whole class in at break time because someone wouldn\u2019t stop talking. It\u2019s a collective punishment, and it\u2019s not fair. Pregnancy is already a stressful, physically arduous experience.', 'Taking away an exciting, important moment from expectant mothers to prevent others from making a reproductive choice that we find unpalatable is sexist, patronising and yet again illustrates that we do not want to trust adult women with their own bodies.', '\u2018We believe in the right of women to access information about their bodies, including their own pregnancies, and do not support a ban on the use of NIPT to establish fetal sex. There are many reasons why women may want that information where it is available, and for many women learning the sex of their baby is an important and valued part of their momentous and life changing pregnancy journey.', '\u2018Sex selective abortion does not occur routinely in the UK, and statistics from the Department of Health do not show an unusual gender imbalance in any ethnic community in this country. We are concerned about the assumptions that are sometimes made about how women living in particular communities might use this information if access to it were made more easily available. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics report published last year, which first called for a ban on the use of NIPT for fetal sex, did not engage with any women to explore this issue with them, and women\u2019s voices were almost entirely absent from a report which was permeated by a mistrust of women and their behaviour.', '\u2018In the circumstances where a woman is under pressure to produce a child of a particular sex the ethical answer is not to deny every pregnant woman the right to find out information about her own pregnancy, but to do our utmost to challenge misogynistic attitudes, ensure gender equality and access to comprehensive women\u2019s support services so that women can make their own choice about their pregnancy free from coercion.\u2019",

Calling for these ban on IPTand citing a certain set of <b> ethnic </b>groups to argue the case is very irresponisible.Being an<b>  Indian</b> I can tell you it not as bad as she is making out. She must be politicising this for her own agenda.Yes there are a minority who are using these tests to abort girls in certain communites but that is a very small proportion and is not valid enough argument to force an outright ban.Sorry I smell BS.",
