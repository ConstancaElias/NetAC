        "postText": "I am privileged.', 'I have parents with professional jobs. I have a university education which my family helped fund. I am able-bodied. I am slim. I am relatively young.', 'These are all factors that make existing in this world easier for me than for many other people. Society rewards me for these things, which are entirely out of my control, and it effects the opportunities granted to me, my potential for success and the way people treat me in day-to-day life.', 'That\u2019s what privilege essentially is. Advantages that are handed to you on a plate without any personal input whatsoever.', 'Existing alongside my privilege are the systemic and societal disadvantages I also face \u2013 equally due to factors entirely outside of my control.', 'I\u2019m female. I\u2019m not white.', 'But then, even within my non-whiteness, my light skin and proximity to whiteness provide me with a certain privilege in the context of colourism and respectability politics. So it\u2019s far from simple.', 'Privilege is a sliding scale. You\u2019re not either \u2018privileged\u2019 or \u2018not privileged\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s not that black and white. Most of us are both privileged and disadvantaged to some extent. It is absolutely worthwhile interrogating your position on that scale and working out where you sit.', 'Thanks to the current political climate and generations of hard work and incremental progress by marginalised groups, we now, on the whole, recognise inherent privilege as a reason for the advancement and superior position of certain groups in society.', 'But when it comes to personally acknowledging that privilege, for some reason, it becomes incredibly difficult for people to do.', '', 'Plus-size fashion blogger Stephanie Yeboah tweeted about privilege this week in response to comments from slim people refusing to accept that being slim in today\u2019s society provides them with privilege.', 'Stephanie correctly identified that being called \u2018privileged\u2019 is now seen by so many as a slur.', 'She went on to say: \u2018We live in a landscape now where everyone wants to feel oppressed though, so people take it as an insult now when you say that they receive adequate treatment as human beings. A weird flex, but OK.\u2019', 'The mental gymnastics people will perform in order to avoid the label of \u2018privileged\u2019 is impressive. And this desire to \u2018feel oppressed\u2019, as Stephanie puts it, is symptomatic of a society that is reluctant to claim responsibility for its systemic inequalities.', 'If we are all adamant that we are not privileged, that we haven\u2019t had a leg up in life, then it\u2019s not possible to recognise the real injustices and discrimination that so many are facing.', 'It also undermines the struggles of disadvantaged groups. If inherent privilege isn\u2019t a thing, it suggests that their limited position in society is somehow their own making.', 'Not only that, but denying your own privilege will just really annoy people.', 'A recent Vice article looked into the phenomenon of people pretending that they are working class, when their families are actually incredibly wealthy. We\u2019ve all met those people.', 'Friends who cover their tracks when they buy new clothes and insist they got everything in the sale. Friends who don\u2019t want to tell you that it was the bank of mum and dad that helped them buy their first home. Friends who carefully omit the fact that their uncle owns the company where they\u2019ve just landed a big promotion.', 'A study by financial services group L&G found that one in four UK housing transactions in 2018 relied on a parental cash injection.', 'Parents lent or even gave their kids \u00a35.7bn last year alone. 316,600 people received help from their family to buy a home \u2013 up by almost 19,000 people since 2017.', 'So a lot more people are receiving a helping hand to get on the property ladder than are probably willing to admit it.', 'It\u2019s maddening and patronising. I want to shake these people and tell them to just admit it already. No one will hate you for having wealthy parents who can help you buy a property, but they might hate you for lying about it and pretending you did it on your own.', 'I get that it\u2019s a bit of an ego hit \u2013 people would much rather give the impression that they\u2019re completely self-made, that any success that comes their way is down to nothing more than their own hard work.', 'But being completely devoid of any privilege whatsoever is incredibly rare. Hardly anyone makes it on totally on their own: It\u2019s disingenuous and annoying to insist that you have.', 'So why are people afraid to admit that they have privilege?', 'As I\u2019ve already mentioned, privilege is out of your control \u2013 it\u2019s something that\u2019s handed to you, something you\u2019re born in to, so it seems ludicrous to be ashamed of that.', 'It would be far more helpful if people could recognise their privilege and use it to help people around them. Or, if not that, at least provide the clarity for people to really understand how and why they have got to where they are.', 'The wilful refusal to acknowledge that you have had a helping hand in life, be it due to being conventionally attractive, born into family money or the simple fact of being a white male, is so destructive for the people who have never and will never have a helping hand.', 'There\u2019s nothing wrong with being privileged. But accepting the benefits of that privilege whilst denying its existence is damaging.', 'Ignoring and refuting the existence of privilege helps to perpetuate destructive societal inequalities. But recognition, clarity and openness about the different forms of privilege is the first step in tackling the unfair disparities and redressing the balance.",

            "commentText": "Because it\u2019s an infantile paradigm that boils identity characteristics down to a singular metric, but ignores all contexts and nuances.Because it drives people to focus on their differences from one another rather than their <b> common </b>humanity and similarities.Because it drives people to illegitimately claim minority \u2018oppressed\u2019 identities in an attempt to mask their own \u2018privilege\u2019. People reject the ideology of \u2018privilege\u2019 because they instinctively understand that it does not reflect the real world in any meaningful pragmatic way.Overall it\u2019s an ideology that needs to go back to the sociology departments of universities. It\u2019s application in the real world is just driving people apart rather than bringing us together.",

The \"<b> racism </b>= power + privilege\" crap is another invention of sociology departments - a very specific definition that has been attempted to be made into the default.<b>  Racism</b> is prejudice towards someone of another based on their skin colour. The interesting thing is that people like Natalie Morris here believe the concept of privilege to be undeniable and axiomatic. And it's not. It's just an arbitrary framework for understanding the world - and not a very good one. People do not find it hard to acknowledge their privilege, Natalie, they just reject the concept outright, as they should. And you can't bully or coerce them into accepting any part of it.",
