 "postText": " Ask a straight man, How do you like your women? and it's unlikely he'll answer, Dumb and sleepy. But according to new findings, these characteristics and any other traits suggesting that the lady isn't particularly alert are precisely what the human male has evolved to look for in a one-night-stand. In an article soon to be published in Evolution and Human Behavior, University of Texas--Austin graduate student Cari Goetz and her colleagues explored what they called the sexual exploitability hypothesis.... Ana Kasparian, Cenk Uygur, and Steve Oh discuss on The Young Turks.  Read more here from Jesse Bering on Slate: http://www.slate.com/articles/health_...

    "commentText": "Hmm, this study is intresting yet valid and invaild in a way.the wording of that study was pretty unscientific, yet I see the intention behind it.\"Men find women who appear to be less witty as attractive, compared to the witty looking female\" The reason behind this is that a man would find her to be 'easy' in a way of getting laid. But this study is invalid because it states that, \" A man would be looking for a women to spread his seed. The false assumption is by that very statement, firstly a man wouldn't want to spread his seed to such a women in this day in age. He would only want to have intercourse with her and sense she 'appears' to be unintelligent she would be the best target. Also my question to the person who createdd such a false assuption would be this, \"How would you tell if a women was intelligent or not by just looking at her instead of having a conversation?\" Also pictures in the way women appear to look unwitty could also not be validated unless she were to be tested. Eiether way all men are pretty diffrent and such an assuption between apperance compared to intelligence is invalid and a women cant appear to be unwitty yet you chat with her and could tell.",

Yet if that same woman gets drunk and starts driving a car well now shes responsible and she has to face the penalty for drunk driving. Whats up with the double standard?",

The reason why I say this is because the study seems to equate women who want have sex as being stupid, as if a promiscuous proclivity is a sign of intellectual deficiency. The only way one associates women who have sexual desire as being stupid is if you are informed by twisted religious morals.",

Males have no mandatory obligation after sex (besides culturally affixed ones). Females risk getting pregnant, which is a 9 month ordeal that requires years of commitment after birth. Men who are simply trying to satisfy a carnal urge will pick who is most likely to satisfy it. But there are always exceptions in nature.",

    "commentText": "Your premise is the conventional wisdom many evolutionary biologists recite, but much research shows that prehistoric women had sex w/numerous men & had the sperm of multiple men inside them at once. In fact, many sperm serve as \"blockers\" that prevent other sperm from fertilizing, which tends to show that sperm of different men competes inside the uterus. Thus, women are not necessarily more 'selective' b/c the strongest sperm inside her wins out. Read Sex at Dawn, a great book on this topic.",

Conscious decisions, I would have to argue, do matter in this day and age. \"Spreading one's seed\" once mattered for the very survival of one's kin and therefore there was once imperative. Now, that is not the case, and sex is minimally a pleasurable act. Pleasure may have originally been to increase the likelihood that human's reproduce, but now, it is mostly the main concern for sex in my opinion.",

You can't claim that a study is flawed just because you disagree with its findings. There are other factors in play here besides the conscious desire to have sex. Genes are selfish.",

To rape a woman because she is dressed provocatively is to act on base instinct and therefore it is not the actions of a rational human being. It is not me who is de-humanizing anyone, it is you by suggesting that men have no control over there own bodies and thus will rape any woman whom they find sexually attractive.",
