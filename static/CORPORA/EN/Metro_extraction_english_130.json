        "postText": "It will always be peculiar to me how millions of black people throughout history can say something exists but it won\u2019t actually be recognised as \u2018real\u2019 until a white person deems it so.', 'Black people have marched, boycotted, campaigned and in some cases been assassinated all in the name of calling out racism.', 'I meet lots of people (sometimes even black people) who will still deny its existence, yet Prince Harry states in a Vogue feature (guest edited by his wife, Duchess of Sussex, Meghan) that unconscious bias is a real thing, and suddenly mainstream media want to talk and unpack what he could mean by this.', 'Rejoice! A white man, a prince no less, has confirmed something black people have known and experienced for centuries. It\u2019s a step forward, I guess.', 'Unconscious biases are prejudices individuals hold towards others, learned unknowingly through perpetuated stereotypes.', 'I suspect, due to Harry\u2019s relatively new proximity to blackness through his relationship with Meghan, he\u2019s facing the reality of racism, privilege and how it functions as a mechanism of sorts to hold one group of people higher than others.', 'The backlash Meghan has faced for guest editing the September issue of Vogue, is a clear example of the unconscious bias Harry speaks of.', 'Many commentators raged that \u2018royals don\u2019t guest edit magazines!\u2019, even though Kate Middleton guest edited HuffPost UK, Prince Charles guest edited Country Life magazine and Prince Harry guest edited BBC Radio 4 Today.', 'What is on display here is a dislike for Meghan because of her biracial heritage. She is receiving more criticism because her blackness isn\u2019t something that can be ignored since her mother is very much black and very much in the public eye.', 'Meghan is also working with Edward Enniful, who is the first black editor-in-chief of Vogue, on an issue of the magazine focused on women of whom the majority are black/ bi-racial.', 'Meghan should be commended for using her platform to celebrate women who are othered because of their race, not criticised. I, for one, look forward to reading the entire issue.', 'I appreciate Prince Harry is encouraging a conversation about unconscious bias, but I wish it didn\u2019t take a newly forged proximity to blackness for white people to question their privilege and the violence inflicted upon others to gain it.', 'I also wish it didn\u2019t take a white person, usually a white man, to confirm societal injustice for other white people to consider it might be real after all.', 'There is a sense of urgency that I feel when we talk about unconscious bias, because while the mainstream are still grappling with the term, it is a contributing factor to the reality that black women in the UK are five times more likely to die during childbirth in comparison to white women.', 'These biases don\u2019t just exist in a vacuum, they are harmful and affect the lives of marginalised communities in a myriad of ways. The sooner these prejudices are realised the sooner change can happen.', 'Terms like \u2018unconscious bias\u2019 \u2013 and \u2018diversity\u2019 and \u2018inclusion\u2019 \u2013 are fluff words that strip white people of the accountability they need to possess about the very real ways they perpetuate racism.', 'Racism is a thing that you can\u2019t unsee once you truly see it.', 'Dr Robin DiAngelo describes very well why some white people struggle to engage in discussions about race, by stating that white people are \u2018used to moving through a wholly racialised world with an unracialised identity\u2019.', 'Hence when I\u2019ve engaged in conversations about race some white people have felt affronted about the term \u2018white\u2019 since they\u2019re simply used to being referred to as people and no racial prefix.', 'The fragility and inability to have nuanced conversations about race is therefore a consequence of most white people never having been confronted with the reality of a system that insists whiteness is the norm and using that as justification for the inhumane treatment of those who aren\u2019t white.', 'For meaningful change to happen this emotional fragility needs to take a back seat.', 'I am interested to see how this conversation about unconscious bias evolves. Perhaps Prince Harry might use his new understanding of racial bias to critique Britain\u2019s imperialist past (and present) and how the monarchy are figureheads for its existence.', 'It\u2019s all very well talking about unconscious bias when it was a very conscious bias that lead to the transatlantic slave trade and colonisation.', 'Racism is a thing that you can\u2019t unsee once you truly see it, and it isn\u2019t a case of merely looking forward for change, but interrogating the past to truly understand how we got to this point in society.', 'We all have a role to play in dismantling structures that no longer serve us. I\u2019m continuing to do my bit by writing pieces like this as well as speaking to trainee police officers recently about racism and unconscious bias.', 'Prince Harry is starting to do his bit (in this conversation about race specifically) by waking up to the realities of racism, so I can only imagine that maybe, just maybe change might be possible?', 'I might just be getting ahead of myself here, but if you\u2019re going to shine a light of hope, I might as well bask in it.",

            "commentText": "Yes, Prince Harry is correct.The problem is, because the <b> racist </b>beliefs are unconscious, it's going to take years of long, hard, dedicated, consistent work for a white person to deprogram his mind of the decades of cultural conditioning and programming that he received growing up and replace it with the opposite.There are no shortcuts to this at all. Ignore all of the self-help and life coaches who try to convince you otherwise. The countless marketing pitches that it take 21 or 66 days to change a habit, especially all of the ones associated with something as deep-seated as unconscious<b>  racism</b>, have been proven wrong by countless experts in many different fields and disciplines.It's going to require much more time, most likely years.The first step is you have to want to do this, want to undertake the long, difficult journey.You also will need to learn how to cope with the intense retaliation from other whites who don't want to see systemi<b> c racis</b>m ended for good.Making big changes like this in yourself can cost you friendships, family relaitions, job and career opportunties, so you need to be prepared.",
