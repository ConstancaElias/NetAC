        "postText": "'French world No 31 Alize Cornet was accused of unsportsmanlike behaviour after she briefly took off her shirt, exposing her sports bra, when she saw it was on back-to-front.', 'Cornet, 28, had returned to court after a \u201cheat break\u201d as temperatures soared to 100F (38C) at Flushing Meadows in New York on Tuesday.', 'Tournament organisers last night expressed their regret at the ruling and said all players were allowed to change their shirts on court but should do it when sitting in their chair between games.', 'The clarification came after leading figures in the sport accused officials of double standards as top male players regularly remove their shirts in view of the crowd.', 'Judy Murray, mother of tennis champ Sir Andy, tweeted: Alize Cornet came back to court after 10 minute heat break. Had her fresh shirt on back to front. Changed at back of court. Got a code violation. Unsportsmanlike conduct...but the men can change shirts on court.', 'Cornet spoke later of the controversy, she said: For sure, the women are treated a little bit differently, admitted Cornet, who ended up losing her first-round match to Sweden's Johanna Larsson.', 'I think it gets much better,especially in the tennis.', 'I want to be clear about it and I didn't take it that bad. I was just maybe disturbed for 10 seconds and that was it.'",

Woe betide a fish and chip shop owner who pays a man a penny more than a <b> woman.</b>  So why are the tennis people allowed to have separate women's events?  The same with the Olympic games: if the ladies are just as good as the men, then let us just have one section of the Olympics no more men and women.  Will some women's libber explain why they are  not campaigning against Wimbledon and the Olympics?",
