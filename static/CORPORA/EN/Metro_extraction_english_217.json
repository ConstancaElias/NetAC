Secondly we don't know what the TFL member of staff said to the perpretator other than shaking his hand. What was the reason for shaking his hand when this individual has been accused of spouting islamophobic abuse. Personally I would have attempted to hold the individual there without the need for force and if he got away then at least the attempt is better than not trying. Lastly your lack of sympathy is absolutely disgusting. Imagine if it was your own daughter, niece, nephew etc etc",

I guess not. Run from my country? I was born in the UK mate but if it wasn't for the british colonizing India, none of us would be in the UK in the first place.
