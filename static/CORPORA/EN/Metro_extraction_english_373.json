        "postText": "Three teachers have been suspended after a boy with special needs was left outside in freezing conditions.', 'Levi Blackshaw, 11, was found naked and curled up in a ball outside Stanley School in Pensby, Merseyside on October 30, last year.', 'Speaking this week Levi\u2019s mum Suzanne Cole said she did not know about what had happened to her son until the day after when a witness spoke to her.', 'She said: \u2018When I found out I was just crying. I went into the school and I nearly smashed the classroom up.', '\u2018My partner had to get the social workers and I had to be removed from the building.', '\u2018I demanded to see the CCTV footage from the head teacher and it took two weeks. When we saw it I was crying and even he was crying.', '\u2018It was awful. What\u2019s really hard is how can you prove how Levi was affected? He is non-verbal, he is not like us.', '\u2018He came home from school that evening and we didn\u2019t even know. You send them to school to be protected.\u2019', 'Eleven months on, head teacher Anthony Roberts, his deputy Cecilia Maxwell and his assistant Helen Clements have all been suspended as an investigation continues.', 'Her partner Alex Kearney said: \u2018The CCTV footage says it all. As witnesses said he was curled up in a ball crying like a baby.\u2019', 'Levi, who has behavioural issues related to his Down\u2019s syndrome, had been \u2018acting up\u2019 on the day of the incident so was left in a classroom on his own.', 'He started playing with water and took his clothes off when he got wet by splashing himself.', 'It is then alleged that he was taken to a different classroom where Ms Maxwell asked colleagues to take him outside with just a towel on his shoulders.', 'After eight minutes he was given a pair of shorts but then CCTV footage shows him being left for another 22 minutes.', 'The school is investigating the allegations and parents have been informed that the head, deputy head and assistant head are \u2018not in school at the moment\u2019.', 'David Spencer, chair of governors at Stanley School, said: \u2018Governors have appointed a new temporary leadership team to take over the management of the school while a full investigation is carried out into concerns that have been raised.', '\u2018We would like to reassure pupils and parents that it will be business as usual at Stanley and staff and governors are working together to ensure that the children continue to work in a happy and supportive atmosphere.', '\u2018The pupils\u2019 welfare and best interests are paramount and we will keep parents informed.\u2019",
