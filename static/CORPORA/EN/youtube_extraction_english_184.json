        "postText": " Amelia believes when what we can or can't do is determined by our age, we are limiting ourselves and our society.  At the young age of 11, Amelia started directing commercials, short films, and documentaries. 4 years later, she reflects on defying ageism, how she has benefitted, and her hopes for the future. Amelia Conway is a film maker of short films, music videos and commercials. She is also fourteen years old, and can't figure out why her age is such a big deal. Amelia made her debut in the entertainment industry when she co-hosted a radio show on the internet station 'Little Radio' at seven years old. Since her radio days, she has gone on to make several short films and music videos. She has worked with many well-known brands \u2014 including Toms Shoes, Beats Music and American Girl Doll \u2014 and recently directed campaigns for Target and NASCAR.. . Amelia has a finely-honed taste for music and old films that has served her not only in her filmmaking, but also in her musical endeavors. She has been a member of Ryan Gosling's band 'Dead Man's Bones' in the children's choir, and traveled on the 'Railroad Revival Tour' with Mumford and Sons.. . For Amelia it's not about being known as a young director, or even a girl director for that matter. It's about being a creative director, one aimed at inspiring people of every age and gender to do what they love and pursue their passions no matter the obstacles. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx ",

The definition of any of the \"ism's\" is the belief that one group is superior to the other. Adults and the<b>  elderly</b> are superior to teens, because for one the teens don't have the intelligence and sharpness of the adults and they also don't have the wisdom of the elderly",

                    "commentText": "not going to lie the education system is much better now, therefore the younger generation is more aware and in most cases smarter and sharper than adults. Another problem is that the <b> elderly </b>stick to what they like and are not open for much to change and therefore most despise the younger generation due to a change in culture. Which in my opinion is the main reason. I dont believe any group is more superior because theres many elements that need outweighing. However it is more present that<b>  ageism</b> occurs more to teens, like i said due to the change in culture and even technology.\n\nthis is coming from a 16-year-old.",
