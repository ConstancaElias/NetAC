        "postText": "'Jacob Rees-Mogg has been invited to a naked debate by Dr Victoria Bateman, who stages naked protests against Brexit. Today Programme host John Humphrys asked: Shouldn\u2019t the other Brexiteers themselves do the same? What about Jacob Rees-Mogg? Jacob Rees-Mogg sitting in your chair naked - what do you think? Dr Bateman then challenged the Brexiteer MP: Well I would invite them to. I would be quite happy to do a naked debate.', 'I invite Jacob Rees-Mogg to do a naked debate with me and we will see.', 'We will get to the root of this issue, the issue being that Britain faces many, many problems right now.', 'From housing to the NHS, but the European Union is not the cause of those problems.', 'Mr Humphrys then concluded the interview and chuckled: I think maybe I should make no comment on that.', 'Dr Bateman also appeared naked on Radio 4 's Today programme, with the slogan Brexit Leaves Britain Naked written across her body.', 'Referring to the slogan, Dr Bateman said: It carries three important messages, and the first is that Brexit leaves Britain\u2019s economy exposed.', 'The second is that Brexit has served to reveal some anti - immigrant sentiments of a kind that we should be very much worried about as a society, and finally, Brexit exposes past government failures.', 'Government failures that left many people feeling they have nothing to lose from Brexit because they have nothing at all.', 'At one stage in the interview, Mr Humphrys asked: Do you think in 2019 that women are judged on their bodies?', 'Dr Bateman replied: I do. All you have to do is look at the online response to a two-minute section of my naked lecture that I posted online in the last couple of days and you will see people firing back with comments of the kind this woman is trashy because she has got her body on show or this woman is stupid.', 'Dr Bateman\u2019 s naked protest against Brexit is one of a handful of odd demonstrations and performances she has graced the public with. ', 'In July 2016 - one month after the referendum result - the Cambridge University professor showed up to a meeting naked in protest of the Leave result with Brexit scrawled over her bare breasts. ', 'But despite the dramatic statement on the UK\u2019 s exit from the European Union, no one in the meeting at the nation\u2019 s oldest university said a single word about her unorthodox display.', 'A source that also attended the meeting said: This was a standard meeting about the teaching of economics and we moved away from her state of dress.', 'We remained silent on that issue and managed to get through the agenda in the meeting.', 'In 2015, the feminist said denying women the right to be prostitutes was a form of sexism.'",
