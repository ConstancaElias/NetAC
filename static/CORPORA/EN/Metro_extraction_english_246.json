        "postText": "Controversial \u2018gay cure\u2019 therapy will be banned in the UK under a new government action plan to \u2018improve the lives\u2019 of LGBT people.', 'Prime Minister Theresa May said the \u00a34.5million initiative aims to tackle discrimination and the \u2018burning injustices\u2019 that the LGBT community face today.', 'The initiative follows a major government survey which more than 108,000 people responded to, and banning the so-called \u2018gay cure\u2019 therapy is only one part of the new plan.', 'The action plan states: \u2018We will consider all legislative and non-legislative options to prohibit promoting, offering or conducting conversion therapy.\u2019', 'Prime Minister Theresa May said: \u2018We can be proud that the UK is a world leader in advancing LGBT rights, but the overwhelming response to our survey has shone a light on the many areas where we can improve the lives of LGBT people.', '\u2018I was struck by just how many respondents said they cannot be open about their sexual orientation or avoid holding hands with their partner in public for fear of a negative reaction.', '\u2018No one should ever have to hide who they are or who they love.', '\u2018This LGBT action plan will set out concrete steps to deliver real and lasting change across society, from health and education to tackling discrimination and addressing the burning injustices that LGBT people face.\u2019', 'The survey found that 2% of respondents had undergone conversion therapy and a further 5% had been offered it.', 'Two in three of those who took part said they avoided holding hands with a same-sex partner in public in fear of negative reactions, and 23% said work colleagues had reacted negatively to them being LGBT.', 'The survey also found that half of those who accessed or tried to access mental health services said they had to wait too long.', 'LGBT hate incidents had been experienced by 40% of people in the survey, with more than nine in 10 of the most serious offences going unreported.', 'The plan aims to look into the scale of LGBT abuse online; improving mental healthcare for LGBT people with a focus on suicide prevention; combating homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying in schools, and increasing awareness of the services available for victims of sexual assault and domestic abuse.', 'Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell welcomed the move on conversion therapy, but said the overall plan did not go far enough and called the budget \u2018insulting\u2019.', 'Mr Tatchell, who has been invited to attend a Downing Street reception for the LGBT community, said: \u2018The biggest fail is the lack of any pledge to end the detention and deportation of LGBT+ refugees fleeing persecution in violently homophobic countries like Uganda, Iran, Russia, Egypt and Jamaica.', '\u2018Another big omission is the absence of any commitment to compensate gay and bisexual men who were convicted under past anti-gay laws.', '\u2018They suffered greatly, frequently being hit with huge fines. The \u00a34.5 million budget is derisory and insulting.', '\u2018It coincides with cuts in funding for sexual health clinics, which make it hard to get testing and treatment appointments.', '\u2018This is contributing to a rise in infections among gay and straight people.\u2019', 'Laura Russell, of the LGBT campaign group Stonewall, said it was \u2018heartbreaking\u2019 so many people had been offered conversion therapy.', 'She said: \u2018Our 2015 Unhealthy Attitudes report revealed that one in 10 health and social care staff across Britain witnessed colleagues express the dangerous belief that someone can be \u2018cured\u2019 of being lesbian, gay or bi.\u2019', 'A national adviser on reducing LGBT inequality will be appointed as part of the initiative.",
