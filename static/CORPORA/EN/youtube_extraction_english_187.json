            "commentText": "Much of what Gottschalk identifies as cultural infantilization comes down to the shift Gilles Deleuze describes as that from 'disciplinary' societies based on enclosed spaces with their more oblique disciplinary and punitive structures, to the so-called 'societies of control'. These are founded on open, interconnected systems and technologies that appear 'open' and to provide individuals greater freedom, e.g. in the form of highways or pocket-sized internet terminals, while actually multiplying power's means of control. You can see this in the traditional right-wing understanding of 'economic freedom' as synonymous with deregulation of labour laws, but also in its very specific conception of 'freedom of speech' as liberated from the cruel and arbitrary limitations imposed by experts and expert knowledge. It has to be said, the right has been very effective in selling this right to talk out your ass, especially when done by corporate-sponsored politicians, as a source of civil empowerment. And of course, Silicon Valley libertarian tech bros dream of <b> nothing </b>else but circumventing 'gatekeepers' and putting traditional news media out of business. So now we have a Twitter president who enjoys a degree of molecular control over his followers that past cult leaders wouldn't have dared dream of.",

In both cases, the government is protecting industries that are provably harmful (<b> alcohol </b>and tobacco), while denying adults the rights to use those substances, even though they are provably safer. Perhaps their efforts would be more appropriately aimed at people selling those substances to children.

Those answers simply do not exist. We need to make decisions based on the evidence presented to us. This is increasingly hard to do in a country in which there is no longer even any consensus on what a fact is. Trump provided enough evidence which, at numerous points during his campaign, should have disqualified him. We chose to ignore it.\r\n\r\nWhen I first started voting, media consisted of 3 television networks, radio, and newspapers. I'm not waxing nostalgic here. Taking everything into account, we're still much better off today than we were then. But we are bombarded with information, much of it dubious. Whether these inaccuracies stem from malice or ineptitude is, at this point, irrelevant. We still have a responsibility to ourselves ensure its accuracy. Casting a ballot out of fear and anger, then simply hoping for the best, is not a responsible act, and it puts our future in peril.",

Some of us buy toys to support our favorite shows or more of voting with our dollar to see our favorite shows get a second season like with anime considering how much money is pumped in there. As well grownups have always been buying things they don't need! When you grow up you don't just suddenly become an adult and sometimes a man child gets married; why do people pick a man child? Well because sometimes that man child makes a lot of money making him a useful mate and so on and so forth for the ways to be taught to their offspring by the father.",

I DO approve of education that prepares us for the real world, and agree that (with some exception) the American education system has been unsuccessful at adapting to modern life in the past few decades. The idea that the \"real world\" exists separate from modern, \"simple\" technological solutions that have solved previously complex problems is a total crock, though.\n\nYour guest did not take your opportunity to tell us where he draws the line between responsible application of technology and infantilization. He only implies that it has something to do with individual choice. Does he believe we should not have our clothes machine washed, because the real world contains messes that we have to clean up ourselves? Does humanity not deserve the simple solution of a Polio vaccine, because the \"real world\" is full of disease?\n\nTo advocate for discipline, and personal responsibility is one thing. Advocating for a political position by citing a conspiracy theory about computers turning society into children is an unacceptable line of argument, and I can't believe you entertained it, David.",

Modern society doesn't concern itself with teaching younger generations how to be an adult... the expectation is children will just kind of fall into it. Meanwhile, all the predatory influences within society assert their manipulations to guide those younger minds down decidedly unhelpful paths. When they do grow older and have kids of their own, they fail in the same manners their parents did, and the cycle continues.\n\nMy one critique of Simon Gottschalk is that he's overly focused on \"the terminal\" as being the source of infantalization... and I think this focus is fundamentally flawed. Rather, infantlization is permitted to happen by parrents... who themselves have been infantilized. \"The terminal\" is little more than a way to reinforce what has been permitted to occur.",

They exercise little to no critical thinking, focus only on the short-term, and have unrealistic 'Murican dreams and just reminisce about how easier things used to be specifically for their demographic. These are people that think it makes more sense that there are some sort of evil complex impossible conspiracies specifically against them than consider the idea that they're simply wrong and that they don't understand what's really going on and trying to learn. \n\n\nUntil you guys find a way to curb the power your idiots have and give power to the real adults or actually allow your idiot arrogant adult-children to grow up, you deserve to be infantilized. But let's face it - that ain't ever going to happen for the US when your elites can keep pushing the obnoxious 'you're only temporarily embarrassed genius billionaire' narratives so people's pride can perpetually run them into the ground on its own.",

We have created a society where laws and punishment is the norm and there is almost no questioning or critical thinking on how we could create systems that don't need these laws. There's a new problem in society? Well let's not ask ourselves where the problem comes from and imagine a sustainable solution to fix the root cause, let's just make a law, it's as simple as that. There are so many examples, like the simplistic parent to child solution of speed bumps or the use of drugs. We ask our parents/government why are certain substances banned while more dangerous ones are legal?? The answer is most of the time \"Because that's the way it is...\" . So you end up having two forms of immaturity, one that expects to be told how to behave and another that decides to cheat no matter what the consequences.",

These people really are infantilized I shit you not just yesterday my 70-sonething year <b> old </b>Stepdad was asking me what I thought of Acosta ordeal. I said \"if I have to be honest, it was a complete and total fucking embarrassment\" and he's sitting there saying \"the Democrats won! What else do they want? When the commander in chief tells you to sit down you sit down!\". I replied \"and you dont think that interferes with the first ammendment?\" And he shut up and changed the subject but I know I didn't change his stubborn mind. These people are perfect breeding ground for fascists.",

You can keep a wrong opinion. I don't mind. At least not so much. You're mostly just being hyperbolic. You made a good point about prescription drug addiction which is demonstrably connected to consumerism, but also a broken health system which could be still broken without consumerism. I'm not sure what the outrage is about toys.",

Which direction is the cause, and what data suggests the direction? Who gets to decide what is presented in media, and who gets to say what is appropriate? How is your disapproval any different than the late 1800s to early 1900s book bans?\n\n> \"I do not approve of the excessive commercialism we are subjected to, to buy things most of which we don't want or need.\"\n\nWho benefits from overreaching practicality? Money transfers are the economy. Without money moving there is no economy. What are people to do with their excess money? Do you suppose that those who collect do not also donate? And sure there are greedy business overlords, but many industrious laborers can't help who they work for. Could we instead promote workers unions, and have voracious collectors who support the workers with their purchases.\n\nYou even cite the rising AI issue. When the machines take over the work what do we do with our time? Complain about how impractical all the extra time is when all the practicality is taken care of by machines? If time is money we'll have it all, and we'll have none. Maybe we can complain about the AI, but nations compete, so the AI revolution cannot be stopped by simple legislation. <-- LOL ignore this paragraph. I confused some other thread with this one here. I'm leaving the paragraph because it still might be salient.",

Security contractors program the software to define restricted areas within the camera's view (such as a fenced off area, a parking lot but not the sidewalk or public street outside the lot) and program for times of day (such as after the close of business) for the property being protected by the camera surveillance. The artificial intelligence sends an alert if it detects a trespasser breaking the \"rule\" set that no person is allowed in that area during that time of day.\r\n\r\nThe A.I. program functions by using machine vision. Machine vision is a series of algorithms, or mathematical procedures, which work like a flow-chart or series of questions to compare the object seen with hundreds of thousands of stored reference images of humans in different postures, angles, positions and movements. The A.I. asks itself if the observed object moves like the reference images, whether it is approximately the same size height relative to width, if it has the characteristic two arms and two legs, if it moves with similar speed, and if it is vertical instead of horizontal. Many other questions are possible, such as the degree to which the object is reflective, the degree to which it is steady or vibrating, and the smoothness with which it moves. Combining all of the values from the various questions, an overall ranking is derived which gives the A.I. the probability that the object is or is not a human. If the value exceeds a limit that is set, then the alert is sent. It is characteristic of such programs that they are self-learning to a degree, learning, for example that humans or vehicles appear bigger in certain portions of the monitored image \u2013 those areas near the camera \u2013 than in other portions, those being the areas farthest from the camera.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the simple rule restricting humans or vehicles from certain areas at certain times of day, more complex rules can be set. The user of the system may wish to know if vehicles drive in one direction but not the other. Users may wish to know that there are more than a certain preset number of people within a particular area. The A.I. is capable of maintaining surveillance of hundreds of cameras simultaneously. Its ability to spot a trespasser in the distance or in rain or glare is superior to humans' ability to do so.\r\n\r\nThis type of A.I. for security is known as \"rule-based\" because a human programmer must set rules for all of the things for which the user wishes to be alerted. This is the most prevalent form of A.I. for security. Many video surveillance camera systems today include this type of A.I. capability. The hard-drive that houses the program can either be located in the cameras themselves or can be in a separate device that receives the input from the cameras.\r\n\r\nA newer, non-rule based form of A.I. for security called \"behavioural analytics\" has been developed. This software is fully self-learning with no initial programming input by the user or security contractor. In this type of analytics, the A.I. learns what is normal behaviour for people, vehicles, machines, and the environment based on its own observation of patterns of various characteristics such as size, speed, reflectivity, colour, grouping, vertical or horizontal orientation and so forth. The A.I. normalises the visual data, meaning that it classifies and tags the objects and patterns it observes, building up continuously refined definitions of what is normal or average behaviour for the various observed objects. After several weeks of learning in this fashion it can recognise when things break the pattern. When it observes such anomalies it sends an alert. For example, it is normal for cars to drive in the street. A car seen driving up onto a sidewalk would be an anomaly. If a fenced yard is normally empty at night, then a person entering that area would be an anomaly.",

A collector of toys could be more emotionally stable than you. To not get your paranoia up I'll say they could be more emotionally stable than me. I'm not a collector of toys. So I fit the criteria too. They cannot be automatically a \"man-child\" because they collect toys. That is a spurious claim you're making. You're mixing \"toys\", and \"man\", and calling it based on some normative view you have of toys. But that's not how it works. Toys mixed with man has not been demonstrated to be any different than not toys mixed with man. In fact I've met men who are very childish who are adamantly against such toy collection. So not toys mixed with man didn't appear to help them.\n\nAlso when did women come into this? Are you here to save women from men who collect toys? I bet you didn't know people gravitate towards people who have similar interests. And some women collect toys too. You fell on your own sword.",

I said \"grown men these days who fill their homes with childrens toys they bought for themselves\".\"\n\nI'm arguing that we do not know the <b> mental </b>disposition of collectors. A collector of something (perhaps toys) could be more mentally stable than you, or me. Emphasis should be on \"me\" if your paranoia arises again.\n\nWhat nuance in your quoted phrase \"grown men these days who fill their homes with childrens toys they bought for themselves\" demonstrates the<b>  mental</b> disposition of those men. Is it \"bought for themselves\" because from what I understand collectors do mostly buy what they collect for themselves. So if that's your point I don't see the demonstration.\n\nI'm reminded of the outrage over S&M practitioners, and the armchai<b> r menta</b>l health evaluations that non-professionals do on t<b> he ment</b>al disposition of people who do S&M. There was a study not so long ago evaluating <b> the men</b>tal disposition of S&M practitioners. In the study it was found that those who participate in S&M had on average a healt<b> hier me</b>ntal stability than non-S&M practitioners. The occurren<b> ce of m</b>ental illness was much lower in S&M practitioners. For instance there was less depression in that group compared to non-S&M people. This contradicts the normative view of S&M that practitioners of S&M are mentally unstable.",

I find the people who often complained the most were the people who often told us to \"grow up,\" to dismiss our concerns we wanted to explore in a space that encourages adult discourse. Where I practice safe space and trigger warnings in the context of <b> mental </b>health is in my women's group where these things are absolutely necessary for people with PTSD from rape trauma, etc. There isn't any initializing about needing a warning about something that could really trigger a flashback from PTSD.

Some are naturally curious... but most just think they are, but aren't.  So in short, people are inherently stupid, and never go beyond trying to fill their stupidity with non-stupid.... instead often they do the opposite... digging that hole of stupidity deeper instead.\nJust look at some of the woowoo youtube channels and flat or young earth or other such  channels.  Ideas that evidence already exists, and methods to examine evidence that exist that they apparently haven't the time.  And critical thought and understanding how to be skeptical appears to not exist with a large number of people... its usually a minority, but a large minority... about 37% to 40%.",

In my perspective <b> nothing </b>has changed much. It's just gotten faster because of the internet, and mechanized travel. If we look back in history the political environment was not much different. It's just magnified now because a regular Joe, or Josephine can publish their opinion. Even the constitution was formed under the pressure of conservative ideology. There are tons of examples in the past where it was just as bad, or worse. I don't suppose you remember the civil war where a group of states fought to preserve such ideologies through secession.\n\nI would agree that the AI revolution contradicts capitalism, but I'm not sure that is relevant to the current conversation. It appears as more of an oversight by diehard capitalists to me. Most of them would reject the idea that AI poses any threat to their paradigm probably.\n\nFascism has always been a part of society. An informal kind of fascism existed in some pre-liberal Christian sects. So that's not new either.\n\nThe environmental problems are a problem so I don't disagree there.",

Then there is the safe space in schools which I would consider somewhat infantilzation but one can argue its trying to make an environment that is safe for learning vs a space one has to fend for survival.

If you're on a college campus, a place for intellectual debate, something that rarely happens in the real world, and one of the topics being discussed is rape, that can be very triggering for a rape victim. The trigger is warranted, and the argument that you're not doing the victim any favors by giving them the warning because there won't be a warning in real life doesn't hold up, because there won't be detailed discussions and debates of rape irl either. Just gotta think about it for a second to realize that the conservative talking point doesn't make any sense.",

The reality is that we already have post scarcity (production that's vastly more than demand) but our economics prefer mass misery over sharing the results of centuries of research and development to protect the wealth of a few assholes. \n\nAnd BTW I'm an agricultural engineer, I live and breathe resource production and distribution.",

For example in farming a total replacement with hydroponics would result in a 400% rise in productivity above the current rate while also eliminating the need for some massively complex and expensive maschinery, pesticides and would lower the transport costs as you can build hydroponic farms right next to population centers.\nSame goes with housing, Technology(planned obselescense and waste of resources to deliberately make cheaper/ inferior versions of the tech, etc.), services (bullshit jobs), etc.\n\nEliminating the threat of poverty, providing healthcare to all and giving people enough with a single job so that they can pursue self actualization would eradicate a lot of sources of misery while also make a far greater amount of the population happy.\n\nOur wealth distribution is not based on productivity, wages have stagnated while productivity skyroketed in the digital <b> age.</b> Half of the planet's resources are in the hands of a literal handful of poeple, them being that productive is a mathematical impossibility. This is no bug but a feature of capitlaism.\n On top of that it's outright insane to not consider a full time job enough for a decent life at our current level of advancement/abundance.\n\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, you can still have an incentive system built in a post-scarcity economy, however you don't need to tie it into one's living standard when there is no scarcity to balance. That's a barbaric if not outright primitive practice.\n\nIf anything I'd propose a system of networked shared high living standards paired with a stystem where excellence in work is the pre-requisite to be eligible to become a politician.\n\nThat way you no longer have a barbaric system, you have incentives in place, and you have a meritocracy through wich you ensure that all of your politicians are competent and driven enough to be worthy of having their name on the ballot.\n\nThere's also the thing that by 2030 38% of jobs will be gone and 60-80% by 2050 meaning that a supermajority would have to be considered as \"failures\" and suffer under capitlaism despite an overabundance.\nIt's like having replicator technology from star trek but only allowing those who own the intellectual property to have enough money to use them.\n\nAnd if we are to add in the upcoming tech in genetic and cybernetic augmentation then we're entering a massive dystopian shithole of a mess if we keep going this way.",

In fact, your next post there confirms it. You actually think the \"some people are more productive\" argument is a good one.

Although Paul kind of did his own thing in order to bring in new members to the church. \n\nReligion is a business now but that doesn't mean we can't learn things from its teachings. And it's a fair argument to say morality predates relion and it doesn't take God to know treat others the way you wish to be treated but there are things about man that have stayed consistent for a very long time. I think the Bible is very useful in that type of study",

People would rather just make snap conclusions and pick their side of an argument without even thinking about it and instead just talking words that have no thought behind them, but if you actually stop and think logically about the specific pros and cons of permanent surveillance, the primary pro is all crimes being punished and the primary con is delusion snowflakes will think the world is watching them, (part of a larger theme of them thinking the whole world centers around them). The only people who should be arguing against surveillance are the ones who have something to hide, they are the very ones who should be being surveilled.",

I am seriously glad I don't have a college master's degree (that I actually deserved) and an I.Q. of 125 or more. I think I'd go nuts.\n\nEdit: I replaced a wrong word.

In case you were:\n\nWhile I actually hardly ever think about how things other people/institutions etc. (governments, society as a whole, the president of the city I live in) do affect me, I do think about how things I do affect other people. I'm very likely to vote against my own interests, because often this just means to vote against my and a small group of other people's interests in a minor way and in favour of important interests of a huge number of people. \n\nTo make an example: If I can either vote for your and your 100 co-workers' pathetic salaries to go down slightly and my own and my two co-workers' salaries to go up slightly or for pretty much the opposite, I vote for the opposite. Because I don't like acting like a selfish dick. This leads to me indirectly thinking about how other people's actions affect my life by thinking about how the election of a certain political candidate could affect my wish to for example not have to life in a society in which the rich get richer and richer at the expense of the poorest of the poorest. I don't want to live in such a world and am therefore willing to give up on 5 % of my income in a szenario in which I could live a good life with 25 % less income.\n\nAt least in absolute numbers there are a lot of people who think like that.",

I used to do similar, but apparently, in terms of political discourse (and not layman's dictionary per se) specifically, the stance 'centrism' means a holder of absolute moderate views. There's the whole Centrist Horseshoe thing I've read about that implies the 'official' position of a centrist is to suggest that the moderated course is always best.\n\n\nSounds good in practice, but that doesn't hold up in very specific issues. \n\n\nEG. Giving no medical assistance is bad, giving people free medical assistance is bad too, so only give them some free medical assistance is the best. Giving people no education at all is bad, giving people free comprehensive education is bad, so giving people some education they have to pay for (hitting a middle ground on all aspects) is best. \n\n\nForgive me, but I think you'd probably be okay with giving people free comprehensive education and not making them pay for a minimal one? If so, then you're not by 'specific' definition, a centrist.\n\n\nI've yet to actually see a historically-accurate politically-specific term for individuals that can make nuanced decisions specifically based on context per individual issue; decisions that can be of either dedicated left or dedicated right OR moderate should it be necessary.",
