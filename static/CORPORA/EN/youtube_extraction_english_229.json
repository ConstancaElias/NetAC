Would you tell an African-American person (for example) that they aren't allowed an opinion on being <b> black </b>because they're not dark-skinned enough? Would you tell them they don't qualify as<b>  black</b> because they're mixed? Horrible parade of hatred in these comments, under the guise of being woke. Who are you to argue with anyone's factual genetic heritage? Who made you the god of what's 'Aboriginal enough'? Smacks too much of the 'one-drop rule' kind of thinking to me. \nYes, all the people in this video happen to be light-skinned, did it ever occur to you that perhaps BuzzFeedYellow chose them specifically because they don't look like the stereotype of Aboriginal people that the video was made in order to debunk? It certainly got all of your attention and got you discussing the issue. It's a roundabout way to do things, but there are other paths of logic in the world than: \"Hurr durr light skin bad, must b<b> e racis</b>t.\"",

Aboriginal people certainly haven't.  If you wanna feel pride, start with yourself.  \n\nMaybe even travel to Britain.  You will see how much pride they actually do have and how much knowledge they have about their history, good and bad.  And because they have that knowledge about their history, they can change things for the better.  Yes they fought and resisted the Nazis and won!  That is something I am very proud of!  Look at the amazing pop culture that has come out of those countries, music, comedy, film, it is all something to be proud of.",

You should've kept the topic of the video on Aboriginal customs and traditions. On what it is like to be Aboriginal while schooling, working, etc. Not \"I am ______, BUT...\"!

Why should it matter so much to begin with it? WHY WOULD YOU EVEN BE INSPIRED TO MAKE THIS VIDEO??? Tell me about THAT! SMH.\n\n...this wouldn't make me feel proud. It'd make me feel lost...and very obviously point out that my background has  made me into someone who has to explain myself to the world.

Indigenous people are not a ubiquitous, one size fits all that the media wants us to believe they are. Before colonisation/invasion of this vast land their were over 250 different tribes / groups that occupied the land. For people to write things like that suggest any of the people in this video are not Indigenous people shows the ignorance and appalling lack of understanding that many of you have. I suppose some of the blame can be that the media and successive Govt's have chosen to not let people know the real truth behind the original inhabitants of this land. But once you do know how great a people they once were (and still are) you will look at Indigenous people very differently . I once was consumed by the stereotypes and thought negatively about Indigenous people. After doing some research in this matter I have changed my perspective entirely... Just to challenge a few people DO you know who the person pictured on the $50 note is and what they had achieved Look it up .. It was the start of my journey and hopefully yours to enlightenment",

I am not Aboriginal, as I am from an Anglo Celtic background; HOWEVER, I am very proud of OUR Australian Heritage and wish that more people who consider Australian home, would unite to celebrate the longest human history in the world.  However, did they come in one two or more waves?  We really need more evidence!  As such we are ALL humans and have participated in the creating of many societies in many areas.  Similarly WE have taken part in invasions of other peoples time and again.  Australia is the best country in the world and it is way past time that WE ALL acknowledged it as such; as well as its FIRST peoples.  Thank you for considering this plea!",

If you are a descendent from an Aboriginal person and have Aboriginal blood, YOU ARE ABORIGINAL. No matter what colour skin you have. Did you know that as a result of the genocide and assimilation brought on by the English, that the Indigenous population dropped from 1 million to 0.1 million? Our culture was dying and so was our people. But I'm glad that now, many Australians are finding and recognising their Indigenous roots, and being proud of that as the eldest civilisation on earth. You are either Aboriginal or you are not Aboriginal. There is no mix. There is no in-between. And others are not entitled to judge and make accusations as to whether these people are or are not Aboriginal on the basis of their <b> coloured </b>skin. Educate yourselves.",

When the average IQ of a aboriginal is 60 it doesn't, mean they aren't any smart aboriginals, it just means they're aren't enough of them. These people are likely more intelligent because they are part or mostly white. I'm not advocating hatred or mistreatment of anyone.

But yes I do believe that they should have got a few or at least one.They're many different nations/tribes across Australia with different cultures so don't think that every indigenous people are the same. Another thing I want to add, Indigenous Australians are generally <b> BLACK </b>because we have dark skin too in our DNA, like many others across the world. Some indigenous people are light skinned because they could be from urban places like Sydney, Melbourne and Perth etc. whereas darker skinned people and others with Indigenous features would come from the rural regions. I am an indigenous person, born and raised in the Pilbara but originally from the Kimberley and Midwest. I consider indigenous people from cities as 'city blackfullas' but at the end of the day, their ancestry counts as being part of who they are.",

People who identify themselves as aboriginal can range from dark-skinned, broad-nosed to blonde haired and blue- eyed people. Aboriginality isn't defined by skin colour but by their family/ancestors. Aboriginality runs through your blood, through your ancestors, it's about your culture and heritage. Aboriginality isn't something u can chose. These guys may be light skinned and have a little bit of white in them but that doesn't mean they're not aboriginal. They maybe be even 2% white and 98% aboriginal, but they happen to have light skin because of that 2%. It's seems as though people have an image in their minds of what an aboriginal looks like, which is often <b> black </b>with dark curly hair. You don't know their life story so please don't judge them because of they're skin colour. And before u wanna comment anything negative please take your time to understand the history of the so-called white Australia and the traditional owners of this land, the indigenous people.",

I realise now that my education has been warped by the view of a coloniser, that has created this intangible criteria of who an Aboriginal person should be. Originally I thought in order to be an Aboriginal you needed to be 'full blood', including skin colour, and still practice traditions from before the Europeans invaded. This standard is almost impossible for a contemporary Aboriginal due to the constant displacement and assimilation that has been carried out through history. It is worrying to see many views, saying they are only 'half-Aboriginal' or 5% etc, which is basically is history of assimilation repeating; where if you were 'white' enough you could blend into white society. No-one, especially non-Indigenous Australians (including me) should determine whether a person should identify as an Aboriginal.",

Sadly alot I wouldn't trust as far as I could throw them. \n\nI have a good friend who is what I describe as an urban aboriginal, she is dark skinned but is definitely mixe<b> d rac</b>e, does not know her mother as she killed herself when she was a child, and who was fostered out when she was I think 10 because her father and uncle sexually abused her. She's extremely intelligent, she kno<b> ws nothi</b>ng of her culture other than the violence it bought onto her",

They wouldn't want to be recognised as aboriginal as they didn't want to associate with such low class people who had a bad reputation.  \n\nNow the narrative has flipped and people exonerate and romanticise them they all put their hand up for hand outs. Coupled with the acceptance of narcissism like selfies it's the perfect recipe to get all the vanilla caramels to stand up and talk about how they are 'proud' \n\nWhile getting free education grants welfare etc etc. \n\nThis is is a globalists trick of divide and conquer the west with guilt narratives while pumping them with conflicting cultures like Muslims who as leftists can bandy together as a coalition to beat down the \u2018evil white patriarchy'. \n\nGeorge Soros and his banking cronies are behind this",

So yeah their skin is light, but they have aboriginal traits, like the nose. So yeah it's a shame they didn't show non-mixed aborigines. There still are a lot of them in Queensland, the North of Western Australia, or the Northern Territory. Unfortunately they must have done their interview in a large city such as Sydney, Melbourne or Adelaide where the only pure aborigines you'll see there are homeless or indeed on benefits.",

The Australian aboriginal was more mild mannered and a lot less war-like than America's native peoples, and their population was tiny, by comparison. The aboriginals were, for the most part, very isolated from other cultural groups. They were more integrated into the landscape. Less likely to be producing stuff to trade. They had/have an emotional bond to the very places in which they reside. \nDespite the efforts of white people in America, the native Americans may have retained more of the culture than some Australian groups.  There was a lot less warfare here, but a greater loss of fullblood native peoples, and a massive loss of their culture. \nCulture is mostly what you chose for yourself, so what is lost can be found again, if the will is present.  Some aboriginal groups are reviving rock paintings, stories, skills etc. Their art work, music, sporting skills are always superior.",

This device is put into the vagina and then removed, pulling away a large part of the womb. The rest of the womb is then cut horizontally and vertically with a stone knife. When this wound is healed, the girl is then circumcised and made to have intercourse with many young men. The mix of blood and semen is collected and given to frail tribesmen as a fortifying elixir.\"",

They created problems where they didn't exist, which have led to further systemic problems for modern-day indigenous people. And yet white Australians still have the audacity to deny all of this, and to continue oppressing Indigenous people, after all they have been through.",

Keep in mind, growing up in the Midwest, most of my knowledge of Aboriginals comes from Crocodile Dundee, (you know, dancing around a fire and playing didgeridoos), and an <b> old </b>Western movie I don't even remember the name of, though I do remember the Aboriginals being portrayed as the good guys/victims.\nI know that just like anyone, some Aboriginals were good, and some were bad, and these perceptions are mostly a result of the bad ones. I apologize if I came across wrong.\np.s. Though this picture was informative, you can't deny it can also be a bit morbid.\n [LINK] ",

They wiped out almost all the native mega-fauna and reduced the rainforest area in Australia by 90%. They also introduced a non native breed of dog, now called the 'Dingo' onto the landmass around 6 thousand years ago which further wiped out more native marsupial species including the Thylacine and Tasmanian Devils from mainland Australia. The reason it seems as though aboriginal people live in harmony with the Australian environment is because by the time Europeans arrived, most of the damage was already done and the ecosystems that make up Australia had mostly reached an equilibrium with the Human inhabitants (who themselves are an invasive species).",

Also excluding them in politics, culture, social systems in a world, wich belongs to them. The settlers build up their state, their system, their capital_s on human graves and installed a capitalist system, how reproduce this <b> racist </b>made distribution, wich let<b>  nothing</b> in the communities, but pain and of cause a powerful culture. In this system you don\u00b4t become rich or successful by being diligent or intelligent. You will get money, if you are selfish and join the destruction of humanity and mother earth. If you want to participate in this patriarchal system of violence and militarism, you have to become violent on yourselfe and on your people or stun yourselfe wit<b> h alcoho</b>l and other drugs. In a fair world, this imperialistic and colonial deseases wouldn\u00b4t exist. Discrimination and oppression causes all this shi*p. Props for your success brothers and sisters, but it is a wrong success in a wrong society with muderous progress under its nice surface. Your maybe really not aboriginal, when you are more identifing with a pro-capitalist white middle class life, then with your oppressed elders and children, who are waiting for a revolution. Because only the oppressed, non-assimilated are the revolutionary subject. \nSorry for my mistakes. English is not my mother tongue. Sorry for my hard words.

All I want to say is, as an Australian myself, and an Australian that has a friend that is aboriginal (and has light skin, even though her father is quite dark) I'd like to voice my opinion and say that personally, I think no matter how light one is, it doesn't conclude how Aboriginal a person is.",

Any word can be used in an offensive or inoffensive manner really, and any word could be found to be offensive or inoffensive by others for whatever reason they like. It's really about the person's intent who is using it more than anything else, as this is the only thing that they can control; they can't control which words other people will or won't choose to find offensive or how they choose to read your intentions. I for one won't be censoring myself constantly for fear of offending anyone out there who I might unintentionally offend. That's no way to live.",

It was so long ago that the islands between south Asia and Australia were connected. There was a very scary large predatory bird ( sorta like the terror bird) that existed them. They killed them all, and I don't blame them! This was a predatory bird as big as an ostrich. Can you imagine? They survived in the outback without a land rover, electricity, air conditioning, or telephones. They had fire, tools, intelligence and persistence. Most of all they had each other. Cooperation helped them survive. White man tried to kill them, erase their culture, breed them out, and destroy them. They took their land, refused their rights as citizens and gave them <b> alcohol </b>to ruin them. But, they are still here.",

So maybe they walked from India but they didn't do it in an afternoon it could have taken a couple of lifetimes, I'm sure I've walked around Aus in my lifetime.\nThere is <b> nothing </b>wrong with you being proud of something if you think it's worth it but don't go glorifying it when some research can make you out to be a numpty. You say they had each other, wow most deaths of aboriginals before the white man came and some time after we're from having the backs of their heads caved in. Men and women met their demise this way. They were superstitious and untrusting of other tribes",

This is incorrect just because you have more then one culture in you does not mean you are any less of that culture. Think of it like having two kids you don't only love each of those kids half just because you have two,you love them both fully. Also just because they have fair or fairer skin does not necessary mean they are mixed <b> race,</b>many Tasmanian Aboriginals have fair skin. Another reason is in the past and today many people of mixed<b>  race</b> are made fun of,being told they don't belong anywhere.Not real aboriginals not real white people (examples).\n\nxx",

A good example is one guy i knew, his great great grandfather was Aboriginal where as the rest of his family were European, he used a European name for himself and yet completely denied the fact that he had more European heritage in him rather than Aboriginal heritage",

It's difficult to keep alive our culture when a lot of the documentation has been destroyed from white settlers or hundreds of nations have been wiped out.\n\nWe only have 3% of Indigenous population left. We have over 600-800 languages and a massive portion of that is lost. \n\nSo, we keep our European names. It isn't about a us VS them mentality. We want to unite with the rest of Australia if the rest of Australia first acknowledges what really happened in our history. \n\nSome families have no choice having a white name bcos it's all we have left. \n\nOther families embrace it \n\nBut there are other families whose members have been oppressed, discriminated or tortured even today in some parts of Australia and despite having a white name, they often don't have a choice. \n\nYou can't simply grab any <b> old </b>Aboriginal name either. It's all connected, it has real purpose and meaning. If you're particular<b>  nation</b> is wiped out, you don't have much to go from there but to keep what we do still have left alive.",

Only two white people in their ancestry yet their skin can be changed that drastically.\n\nI know some areas like in Alice Springs there is still that stigma in some of the groups of being half white. but other tribe leaders I have met in QLD embrace everyone with aboriginal heritage and help them connect to the traditions that are part of them and were stolen from them through the disgusting practices of the governments of the past. \n\nI had a friend die at 25 because of Kidney disease passed down to her from her Aboriginal side of the family, kidney disease is very<b>  common</b> amongst the aboriginal people which I'm sure you know which is often from the quick change from hunter gatherer diets to western diets in just a few generations. Her dad was half cast and stolen generation, her mum white. Yet she still died because of the health struggles many other aboriginals struggle with. She had olive skin and very few distinct aboriginal features. Yet being aboriginal was part of her, and it affected her life in good and bad ways, her skin didn't change her ancestors and the struggles her family had been through and still go through.",

If you didn't know, Aboriginal people tend to lose colour every generation (both of my parents are Indigenous Australian yet I am much lighter then them with blue eyes I also do have a bit of German ancestry as well but I am mostly Aboriginal). If you're talking factual and more legally, the Indigenous bloodline can only go so far back for a person to actually claim they're Aboriginal (like if they're 1/4 Aboriginal or 1/8 or whatever.) However, it's most likely that these people grew up in places where Aboriginal culture is still embraced (mostly small towns that are more inland as opposed to cities.) Just because these people are white in skin colour, doesn't mean they aren't Aboriginal. They know who they are, they know where they come from and their history. So in the end, they aren't lying to themselves.",

The occupier has to distance the masses from the group of people they want to oppress. The occupier has to dehumanize the people they want to oppress. It is 2016,how are people still ignorant about how they are brainwashed by those in power.",

And what's wrong with dark skin? You are truly making having dark skin or living in a cultural hut out to be a bad thing. You look mostly Caucasian and you live A western lifestyle. That's fine, but it sounds more like The initial dream of Australian integration than Aboriginal pride. I would assume that this was an anti-ethnic thing stating that people were managing to live western lifestyles in spite of being Aboriginal. However, I have seen the older European looking gentleman before,  talking about how Australia day should have more respect for Aboriginals. Very confusing.

(an extreme example:) a homeless, alcoholic, unstable person shouldn't be treated as worthless; they should be offered all the help that they need with an understanding that those things are overwhelmingly symptoms of the destruction of their culture and their continued oppression and disadvantage. i can't be proud to be australian unless we respect and care for the least among us, especially when i benefit from the privileges of their oppression.",

Other aboriginal people were sent to camps, forced to speak English. we still have traditional - dark skinned aboriginals but only in certain places. My dad's parents were both aboriginal but my dad was with my mum. The colour stops at me. I would say these people in the videos were half casts like myself or half casts of half cast. I hope this explains enough :)",

A \"white\" looking Aboriginal person could have a full sibling who is very dark, but neither sibling is \"more Aboriginal\".  You just can't tell these things by looking at a person, additionally if you're raised in a culture and a family that is Aboriginal and can trace your lineage, you are Aboriginal.  You either are, or you aren't.  This percentages talk is just a really European construct.  I suppose you'd be surprised that Elders embrace all their mob and teach all their children, regardless of skin colour.",

Now sarcasm aside, retaliation is to be expected when doing what Europeans did to the Aboriginals. Australia is also not a continent. Just because there was no European way of proving that the land was owned by the Aboriginals, it doesn't mean there wasn't an Aboriginal way because there was. \"Enforce ownership\" you mean retaliate hard enough, like the Khoisan in South Africa?\nTo put this in perspective for you, if I raped your mother, sister and daughter, tortured and killed members of your family, burn down the TOWN you lived in, build a CITY over it. I then sell it to my cousin who did the same thing to your friends family, then he filled it with people who helped him accomplish this. And their descendants say \"You should be grateful because we built a city and you get to experience it\" How would that make you feel? I would expect a little retaliation.\nAnd you talk about how Aboriginals complain, that whole comment was you complaining\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21",

This is what the Aboriginals ultimately caused when they started killing the first Europeans. For every European killed, the Europeans then killed many more Aboriginals as reprisals only to have the Aboriginals kill more Europeans as part of their reprisals. The Aboriginals really only have themselves to blame for starting the killings, and the Europeans were the ones who finally ended them. \n\n\n\n\"AND! oooOoh, did you realise that maybe, just maybe the Aboriginals did own Australia?\"\nThey may have thought they did, by virtue of having no competitors for ownership for thousands of years. That doesn't mean they automatically get to actually own it for all time when someone else shows up who has the ability to enforce what they think of as being their own ownership. The aboriginals were just lucky to of had no one else around who wanted ownership for as long as they did. In the end they were just keeping the seat warm. Who owns Australia now can also have their ownership challenged at any time, it's just today, with geopolitics as it is, trying to change ownership now would likely result in a world war. If they won the war, though, Australia would naturally be theirs as they would have eliminated their competition. If you think about it, some <b> alien </b<b> >race</b> could probably claim the entire planet as their own if they existed and wanted to. They may even own it now and we don't even know it. Humans may think they own it, but humans may also just be keeping the seat warm.\n\n\n\n\"Australia is also not a continent.\"\n [LINK] ",

A LOT of white Australians have Indigenous heritage somewhere in their family tree without even knowing it, so obviously they have never identified as such. Then there are those who do know but don't identify, those who do know and DO identify, and those who do know; do identify and are actively involved in Indigenous culture. The vast majority of the first two options aren't identifying as Indigenous on their tax forms, however. Participating in Indigenous culture and being identified within Indigenous communities by other Indigenous people is the changing factor. So when someone says they're Aboriginal, they could be talking about two different things.",

I have worked with Aboriginal people in the Pilbara region in WA and found many of them to be friendly caring people.  My point is the people in this video should not be saying they are Aboriginal, you can by looking at them they only have a small amount of indigenous heritage.  Everything about them is Caucasian, the way they think, speak, dress, act etc.  They should have got real Aboriginal people to be in this video, people who are majority indigenous, not white people with a small amount of Aboriginal blood.",

He is actually disturbed by how  'Traditional'(sic) people see them!? He won't say full blood, because it was a derogatory term. Full bloods were considered the lowest class and then you had 'half caste', 'quarter caste' etc. Half castes and quarter castes were more likely to be given exemption from aboriginal reserves and extra privileges. He doesn't want to be put in an aboriginal class, he is a proud aboriginal person and if he has to be seen as wallowing on the bottom rung of society he will proudly do so! He loves his ancestry, revived language and cultural practices around family. By the way, he is as nearly white as the proud gentaleman in this video. \n\nAs a <b> whitey,</b> I see no difference between you and lighter skinned aborigines.

There are areas of Australia such as TSI, rural NT & WA that have a large population of darker-skinned Aboriginal people, but everywhere else we mainly look like these people in the video.

As soon as I saw the title they would have no full bloods or any aboriginals from a community and wouldn't show whats really going on. No <b> racism </b>intended it's just a shame Buzzfeed didn't show/address how so many aboriginals live. Many live in poor communities funded mostly by the government (Australian tax payers) which the people generally don't maintain to a decent standard then the government has to pay to repair/replace whatever is wrong. Per capita aboriginals get $11,500 per person from the government, compared to $3000 to than any other Australian. Now this isn't one main reason for this there are many but it mainly comes down to poor mindsets from the adult aboriginals so they don't send there kids to school which is never good. Another is poor design plans by the government after the stolen generation. It will take many years for there to be no 'gap' between Aboriginals and non-aboriginals. It will probably take a few generations for this to happen if it ever does, it's up to the people.",

It is a deep set spiritual connection with the land, it's preserving our stories, customs and traditions that would otherwise be lost if we \"don't care too much about what happened in the past\". I don't know any Aboriginal person that would hold a personal grudge towards a white person just for what their ancestors did. But I believe it's important we recognise the things that did happen to our people and become a more resilient and accepting country because of these truths. I also believe that no matter what race/culture or backgrounds we come from, we should all be proud of who and what we are as long as we also accept others for the same exact things. I am well aware that no white person today should be held accountable for what their ancestors did, but I think it's important we preserve the past of our great <b> nation,</b> the good and the bad. I am not just Australian, I am an Aboriginal Australian of the Ngembaa tribe, it is a part of my identity as a human being and to be able to say that WE ARE STILL HERE is something I am extremely proud of because of the rough past our country has.",

Here are a few excerpts for you from 'The Origins of War in Child Abuse':\n\n\"The custom of raping Aboriginal children, eating 'every second child' and making the older children also eat them is termed 'a quite favorable picture.'\n\n\"Mothers regularly forced their children to eat their newborn siblings 'in the belief that the strength of the first child would be doubled by such a procedure.\"\n\n\"The mutilation of young girls' vaginas is also practiced by the Aboriginals, 'in which <b> old </b>men roll emu feathers with a loop of hair. This device is put into the vagina and then removed, pulling away a large part of the womb. The rest of the womb is then cut horizontally and vertically with a stone knife. When this wound is healed, the girl is then circumcised and made to have intercourse with many young men. The mix of blood and semen is collected and given to frail tribesmen as a fortifying elixir.'\n\nDo you need more? How about the literal<b>  witch</b> hunts in Papua Ne<b> w Guine</b>a? These kinds of cultures are not humane and deserve to be wiped out by more civilized people.",

In many Australian schools we attempt to teach about the suffering we (the settlers) inflicted upon Indigenous Australians for hundreds of years. Education aside, this <b> racism </b>is still a massive problem in our society with the massive over representation of Aboriginals in custody, and the prejudice deeply ingrained within our politics cough Tony Abbot is scum cough. We're trying to fix the problem but sadly we aren't trying hard enough.",

Everything in the video is ultimately true but it's also made with \"city\" aboriginals when almost 30% still live on remote communities. And unfortunately the people in this video are the minority within their communities. Only 40% of aboriginals stay on to year 12, and then 20% stay on for higher education.

Not only in orphanages or foster homes, but also in the aboriginal communities, women and children to this day are at constant risk of victimization for physical and<b>  sexual</b> abuse by both aboriginal and white men, both within their family and outside their family. People ignore the issue and those accused can get out of being charged by simply not showing up to court. If people try to get help within the community they are often ignored, ridiculed, or even punished, even by their own family. Children are often forced or coerced into addiction to substances such a<b> s alcoho</b>l and petrol sniffing to facilitate the perpetration <b> of sexu</b>al abuse. Alcoholism and drugs are also a problem in Native American communities but the circumstances surrounding it are a bit different.",

Throughout Australian history, Aboriginals have been discriminated against, given fewer rights, and many of those with lighter skin were taken away from their families and forced to become maids and servants to rich white families.  Even now, Aboriginals tend to be poorer and much more disadvantaged that many other <b> ethnic </b>groups in Australia due to continuing<b>  racism</b> and and a legacy of poverty. However, their culture is extremely rich and colorful, with some of the most beautiful nature artwork of any culture in the world. I think many of the people who will watch this video won't be aware of Australian history, so here's a little background.",

My statement still stands that they are synonymous, which is all I said.\ufeff\nIt's funny you should mention research, when you clearly are uneducated on the etymology of the word \"aboriginal\" stating that the \"ab-\" at the start of the word is the prefix \"not\", which it appears you have just presumed. Ab origine is Latin for \"from the beginning\" which is the opposite of what you said it means, meaning you were entirely incorrect at the tone of your response is totally uncalled for.\nAs a side note, you're perpetuating harmful and dismissive stereotypes by assuming from my pictures that I don't identify as Indigenous Australian when you know <b> nothing </b>about my ancestry.",

The other is saying the same old; \"whittteeesss did everything, thank us for invading and giving you culture\" that they have been saying since they started their little pissing contest around the globe.\n\nIt's all a defense mechanism, it makes it easier on the psyche to exploit, ignore and attack if you believe the person is \"sub-human.\"",

                    "commentText": "+Pedro Bear There's really two reasons for this. One is that atheists -- well, the faithless in general -- are widely distrusted for no particularly good reason, even though we're more visible than we've been at any time since the Enlightenment. That's mainly because a lot of people aren't used to dissociating authority from morality and/or have a faulty concept of human nature as solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and occasionally short; the idea that humans, however imperfect, tend to be wired to look out for each others' interests as well as our own isn't a concept that fills churches, so most people don't get much of a chance to reflect on it. The other is that somewhat like feminism, we have a minority of us who don't know how to behave (for feminists it's TERFs, SWERFs, and other assorted second wave throwbacks; for us it's Randroids, Reddit atheists, and mid-20th century Communists), and people associate that with the entire lot of us. (There's also people like Hitler that others assume were atheists, but were actually religiously motivated; trust me, we don't want them either.) \n\n\nSo yeah, we'd love something like that.",

There's a reason that most scientists aren't religious. And most view creationism as a joke, along with a multitude of other miracles.

My grandmother's mother was Catholic, her FATHER was Jewish. So unless they have changed their \"qualifications\" most in Judaism would probably be skeptical of calling me \"Jewish\", and besides I'm atheist so I'd never identity that way anyway. And as for Israel, it's quite easy to stand against them. They were given a country by foreign powers and then subjugated the natives of that area as they were. They created their own problems, and I feel no sympathy at all for them. You are not obligated to support something just because you're part of a larger \"community\". Respect must be earned, not given freely.",

And as I stated before, your descent is considered through your mother's bloodline, and under those I would traditionally not be considered Jewish. As I said, if they've loosened the qualifications then I'm fine being considered Jewish, but if they haven't then many would not considered me fully Jewish. I've known this for years, as my family still remembers some aspects of Judaism, but my whole family eats pork and everything - so I doubt they'd like us much anyways. But in terms of blood fine, but in terms of affiliating with a religion, you can stop \"being Jewish\".",

That doesn't make them less. And if you knew anything about the history of Aboriginals in Australia, you would know that the British invaders were trying to breed the <b> black </b>out of them with the Assimilation Policy. In 3 generations they actually hoped that the Aboriginal gene would be \"bred out\". They would actively search for light skinned children and then sort them into grades. A-grade meant you were light enough in skin colour and your features 'European' enough to pass as a white child (then give to families who never know of your aboriginal heritage.) B-grade was when you could still be spotted for being Aboriginal if you knew what to look for, but was passable enough to be mistaken for white. Because of the horrendous nature of what the British Invaders did to the Stolen Generation, the Aboriginal community welcome anyone who has Aboriginal in them. The colour of your skin doesn't define you, your mob does because so many Aboriginals were stolen and denied their culture.",

They believed at the time they were a dying race- so they wanted to produce more white people in order to stop them producing more indigenous people. This is also why there was the forced removal of children so they could be 'protected' - but really it was the splitting up of families and white people looking after the children as well.",

The anangu people (centre of australia) are also darker. \n\nHowever, as others have said, due to the attempted assimilation by the white settlers, majority of aboriginal people today are 'lighter'.",

However when you look through history this was not universally the case. Genghis Khan in the 13th century instigated a genocide in Persia so severe that 90% of the population was killed. It was so bad that forests grew back where there hadn't been forests for hundreds of years and the population did not recover until the 19th century. Additionally slavery in the Ottoman Empire was<b>  common</b> until the mid 19th century with European pressure being one of the main factors that drove its decline. These are just two examples off the top of my head.\nWhile European treatment of native peoples in the areas that they colonized was generally extremely poor don't believe that such cruelty and imperialism was a uniquely European trait. It's just that Europe was, in the right place, at the right time to colonize.",

However when you look through history this was not universally the case. Genghis Khan in the 13th century instigated a genocide in Persia so severe that 90% of the population was killed. It was so bad that forests grew back where there hadn't been forests for hundreds of years and the population did not recover until the 19th century. Additionally slavery in the Ottoman Empire was<b>  common</b> until the mid 19th century with European pressure being one of the main factors that drove its decline. These are just two examples off the top of my head.\nWhile European treatment of native peoples in the areas that they colonized was generally extremely poor don't believe that such cruelty and imperialism was a uniquely European trait. It's just that Europe was, in the right place, at the right time to colonize.",

But I think talking about these horrific acts is the only way we can make progress. If we don't shine a light on them people will think that everything is okay when people are being targeted and some even killed. Only acknowledging that it's happening can we try to put a stop to it.

I don't think any of us have researched into any culture (bar our own, maybe) enough to criticise them and say they're categorically bad. I know for the same reason we can't say they're totally good either, but isn't it better to try to see the good side of things if you don't have full information? Not trying to offend anyone, just my opinion!",
