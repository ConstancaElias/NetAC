            "commentText": "I live in Brazil, where a so called nationalist conservative became president. One of the catchphrases, from his presidential running, was \"Brazil above all, God above everything\". He was elected as part of this nationalist wave which hit South America as it did in Europe. Now, in his first year on office, every week we know by the media about some act of nepotism or patrimonialism of  this person. As an example, he used to give some office jobs to friends and friends's relatives, made use of a national aircraft for personal reasons and, lately, are trying to give a post as embassator to one of his sons.\r\nAt this point, It would be very embarrassing someone insisting that he is a symbol of <b> nationalism,</b> haha.",

            "commentText": "Yeah. Right. In the meantime, for whatever reason, white European countries are being flooded with non-whites, and the native whites are quite understandably reacting against this invasion - this is a threat to their identity - their very existence. For their pains the media commonly refers to this as the rise of the Right - a resurgence of the Far Right/white supremicists etc.. Therefore it is the Left who are responsible. The Left cannot wash their hands of this monstrously destabilising movement, not if they insist on calling those who react against it 'Right'.\u00a0\nCertainly no relatively mono-race culture would ever willingly vote for multi-culturalism or to be flooded with other races.\u00a0\nHowever, putting to one side the generous amount of ingrained bias from Harari I applaud him on his little attempt to gulf the divide.  As he suggests, the 'Left' and 'Right' labels are not helpful references to the highly nuanced reality of things, and only serve to polarise. \nThe movement that makes us prefer our kith and kin is a movement of love. It is embedded in our DNA. We must allow for it. We must make it serve us. Opposing this movement is bound to create massive dissonances.",

Just a question; it is referred to \"some Americans hate their fellow citizens more than Chinese, etc.\" as a negative thing, but I am not sure if it really is a negative development - Is not it indicative of the fact that we are becoming more global? Maybe a fellow American has more in <b> common </b>with an Israeli, Chinese, German or Iranian than many other Americans; what is wrong with that? Maybe thinking about consequences of my own actions in one part of the world on other human beings living on the other side of the planet is in fact taking nation-state concept to the higher level, which is planet-state.",

The latter is, at the same time, the negation that overcomes and a way of keeping essential aspects of the first (what hegelian philosophers would call 'sublation'). But for this to work, he needed to twist the concept of<b>  nationalism</b>, by turning to its 'bright side' (the willing to cooperate with and help strangers that you'll probably never meet) and qualifying it as its most fundamental aspect - the true character o<b> f nationalis</b>m. Then he can say that it has its downturns as well, of course, but in essence is a good thing that can be improved. It's a narrative trick, but one for good - I absolutely agree with him that the biggest threats we now face, all of them generated and controllable by ourselves, require whole new levels of global cooperation, and would also add to his list of 'challenges' the abhorrent poverty of billions of people who live in a world of extreme wealth.",

            "commentText": "\ud83d\ude4c great shared thoughts, Mr. Harari, Thank You \ud83d\ude4f\n\nThe issue of <b> nationalism </b>I've witnessed, in my narrow experience in Oslo, Norway comes in the form of how they generate and allocate funding.\nFor example: My husband tends to believe the Green party is pulling funding towards \"annoying\" initiatives and creating problems/hindrances for those outside of the major cities (he's probably thinking of his user of multiple babies daddies sis) in the form of tolls. If I were a more gracious person I wouldn't have uttered sentiments of \"not everyone is comin to the future\" as Madonna put it in one of her latest hit album songs. Yet I understand and share his frustration because it would also perturb me if unscreened folk were allowed to reap monetary benefits in my country and the culture they're from lacks similar basic values as hold oneself accountable for personal finances, resources, hygiene on a private and public level and desire to contribute to society/humanity to Progress rather than resort to backwards practices. Advances go along the line of health promotion/disease Prevention (lifestyle practices that extend on the societal policy and physical urban design level, to even how goods are produced, packaged and distributed on the lowest environmentally damaging level). Backwards practices meaning, determining likeability of others on<b>  race</b> or citizenship when character and value one brings to the table should count as higher priorities.\nDon't they want their country to not be left behind?\nCause being ~wealthy and having beauty can only last so long when far more intelligent and organized groups are in competition or have willing participants ready to work in harmony. \nThey should nurture rather than hinder and distract their talent. Not place preference just cause someone's lineage dates back further here. It's late.... this is more of a venting than thought through post.\n\nAnyhow - so glad Yuval provided a more positive message of what should be promoted out there.\nThank you again and I look forward to what ideas Yuval will share next \ud83d\ude0a",

No. In line with Harari's argument, my experience taught me that my own \"tribe\" / my family are the most important people (I guess even nationalists might think so). But beyond that I care about people of all nations equally - not just those of \"my own country\", so I would argue my lack of<b>  nationalism</b> generally made me more empathetic.

            "commentText": "I'm surprised no one in the audience asked for a sensible definition of the term \"<b> nation\"</b>.\n\nHarari mentioned the German history of formerly separate Prussia, Bavaria, Saxon etc. which already were at a much higher level than just tribes. They were already nations. German nationalists of the 19th century tried to establish a united Germany to make progress away from aristocracy towards democracy and parlamentarism. The new organisational body of power was meant to establish a new political order. The United States of America emerged by similar principles. Modern nations often are manifestations of political ideas. And still there almost always are smaller units of power which make up the<b>  nation</b>, like a number of states or counties. The unit of a town, the Polis, is where the word \"politics\" stems from. This already is larger than a tribe.\n\nHarari somehow left out many intermediate levels and dimensions of human organization and territorial group identity. Why exactly focus on the level of th<b> e natio</b>n? And while nations, as mentioned, often are the product of political ideas, one could also take concepts like religion and science as elements of civilizatory progress. The national level actually could be totally left out, it is just a rather arbitrary backdrop. Civilization could work just as well, maybe even better, without nations at all, but just a territorial hierarchy of organization, without giving that much brand weight to the national one. How is t<b> he nati</b>on that essential? What is it that makes it special? Ironically, Harari mentioned being somehow culturally special a<b> s a nat</b>ion's quality, but this is true for territorial units of any size and hierarchical degree.\n\nWhen praising the civilizational progress a larger body of cooperation provides, the more abstract and neutral way would be not to pick<b>  out nationa</b>lism because of the struct<b> ure a n</b>ation provides, but to name socialism because of the structure a society provides. Or even communism because of the structure of communities, also transcending tribes since the dawn of civilization. Those isms went catastrophic j<b> ust as natio</b>nalism in the 20th century. However, to aim for a less binary understanding of these concepts is just as important as it <b> is with nati</b>onalism.",

Evolution is not all chaos. Life is the emergence of higher order. Central planning is what constitutes not only states, but also families, communities, companies, every cooperational effort. Your computer works with a central processing unit, processing a central plan expressed in machine code. The concept works even though there might be bugs. Don't fall into the trap of abolishing central planning because there is also corruption and incompetence. It only attracts attention when it fails, but most of the time it does not. Central and decentral planning can and must coexist; every decentral unit is just another local center.",

AOL tried this 25 years ago, driven by no other agenda than to make a well selling product, and even that did not work, because they could not keep up with the redacting and categorizing, and people failed to see why they should be restricted to the AOL-approved fraction of the Internet, that typically had not caught up to the thing they were looking for.

Who in Europe just eats his own dishes and hates every foreighner he sees on the street and just watches movies and reads books from his own country? <b> Nobody.</b> Most of todays Nationalists are quiet intelligent people who debate a lot in real life, but preferably in the internet, because there is no constant screaming from<b>  crazy</b> Antifa idiots who are the real fascists in the whole story. The european Nationalist(Called far right or right wing populists) do connect strongly together and work very closley in loads of areas and their voters dont have the slightest problem with it.\n2. What he says abou<b> t Nationalis</b>m and Democracy is true. There can not be a democracy witho<b> ut nationali</b>sm. Countries where you have different ethinc groups, where one ore more dont feel belonging to <b> the nat</b>ion are hardly democratic, but mostly undemocratic with bloody conflicts. And the big problem in Europe is, that mass imigration+ declining birthrates are exactly creating that in most Western European countries. You import masses of people who often come from complete other countries with different values and they absolutely dont identify with their new European home country, but instead with their ingroup and that leads to small conflicts at the beginning and ends up in bloodshed if that group grows further and becomes its<b>  own ethni</b>city in your nationstate. Eastern European states see that and are trying to prevent that as good as they can. Lot of people think you can overcome that simply by unifing Europe in a kind of United States of Europe, but you would just end up with having the same identity politics problem that you have in the USA today. Native Europeans would maybe stop feeling German, Italian, Swedish, Polish and so on but strongly European instead. Every minority would than start to blame the evil white man for every thing and the European white males and women would have no other choice but to hit back in a democratic way first, if not possible then with violence. You would potentaly end up creating a kind of massive European 4. Reich filled with very angry white Europeans. But most lefties a<b> re to</b> dumb to see that.",
