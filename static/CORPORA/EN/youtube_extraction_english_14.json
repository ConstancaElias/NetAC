                    "commentText": "Women already have equal rights. Feminism is based on Marxism, hence the socialist fist in the symbol for feminism. You do not have to be a feminist or a marxist to believe in equality. Thats like a religous person telling somebody that they must be a christian if they believe in god, or a <b> communist </b>telling a person they must be a<b>  communist</b>, if they believe that people should be treated equally. \n\nThe modern version of feminism has little to do with equality and is verging on being a hate movement. The historical narrative pushed by feminists is false. In the uk for example, nearly all men could not vote till about the same time as all women got the vote. Women worked less in the past, largely because contraceptives had not been invented, and they had most of the same rights as men. \n\nYou may think that the great majority of men in 1900 for example, had it much better than women. However life for the great majority of men involved engaging in 12 hours per day worth of manual labour (as nearly all of the work then involved physical labour) and periodically being sent off to die in a war. Thats not exactly something to be envied. Men and women had different roles, but it is ridiculous to argue that women were treated like slaves.",

Men were the obvious target for their vitriol...I guess because God would not respond.  Lots of men gave up on dating.  Many women now understand they were scammed out of pursuing one of the Nobel -ist of professions. That of motherhood.  And now many  are alone and ruefully regretting that they fell for the lie.   Feminism...another social experiment that failed catastrophically...or perhaps it was a grand success if the motive was to reduce the population....of a certain segment (class and<b>  race</b>) of society.",

            "commentText": "Notice how intelligent women say think instead of feel.  If you hear a intelligent <b> woman </b>speak she always says I think this is what is best in this moment.  But Left women are always saying I feel like this isn't what we should do or I feel like this is right.   It is once again women on the right use there brains.  Women on the left use emotion.  Emotion is not a good way to make a decision.  Emotion gets in the way of truth and justice.  Emotion don't care about facts!  Emotion is also a very selfish way of doing things.  Because if you judge things on the way you feel there is no true balance there.  Emotion makes you look at things from a point of view that is basically not the rule.  When it comes to be a soldier you don't use emotion.  Because emotion can lead to making a bad decision.  I love how idiots on the left believe that soldiers use emotion..  They don't, they use duty and there code to make the decisions that save lives.  They follow orders but they have a code that if the orders do not follow the code they are not to follow those orders.  But of course some idiot Left thinks that if a soldier doesn't feel this order is right he can choose not to follow it.  NO YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW ORDERS you have to LIVE BY THE CODE!!!  Emotion has no place in WAR!  Emotion can get you killed in WAR!  Being a Soldier is the most unselfish thing you can do.  Your giving your life for your bother or sister in arms.  You have to lay down your life and you have a beautiful Wife and children at home,  or a wonderful husband and children at home..  You think emotion is a good thing in that decision?  No person who has a wonderful family at home wants to die or even be away from them.  I not saying it's not emotional..  I saying using emotion to make a decision.  Everyone has emotion and it would be there.  That's why they train at the moment to follow the code and to trust the soldiers around you.   Duty is what a soldier is all about.",

You can either see people as individuals who happen to be male or female, or you can go through life believing that one half of the population are evil patriarcal oppressors, and the other half are tragic victims. Simply on the basis of the <b> gender </b>which they happen to of been born as. Feminism is marxist poison. \n\nBasically how it works is you are told that if you believe in<b>  gender</b> equality then you must be a feminist. However next you learn that if you are a feminist then you must also believe in all kinds of other crap. Its like a religous person telling someone that they must be a christian if they believe in god, or <b> a communis</b>t telling others that they must be<b>  a communi</b>st if they believe in equality. Women already have equal rights. \n\nNow its just a way of getting silly and impressionable young girls to support a political agenda, while also serving as a club for unhappy and attention seeking women.",

So did the majority of women and men in my life. I feel we should vote for the most qualified candidate, not because they are a particular<b>  gender</b>, or if people feel it was 'Hillary's turn'. I didn't think she was qualified, I didn't like how she ran her campaign and I felt she was less than honest. Add to that Benghazi and her email scam and you add even more reason not to vote for her.",

I feel like im just a person watching tv while my favorite sration is on \"the world\" i look at the world and think wow all this really happening how can i help how can i make the world a better place but i get too aftaid to speak my mind because of sterotypes and bullies sometime when im at school i think to my self how will i fit in how will i let people know that im different without offending them how can i make sure i do my part in the<b>  black</b> community being mixe<b> d rac</b>e wi<b> th bla</b>ck and Caucasian how can i explain that i am mixed i know both side problems. I have never been in real trouble i have never been in the real world i have only been working on an ice cream truck doing business since i was 1 ye<b> ars </b>old helping my mom there are days that go by when i dont think i belong i say am i real am i really worth being here i dont think about suicide i think about how i can make my self a better person so back to what i was saying about women and stereotypes. I respect women and anybody that i see but just saying now i dont wannw be seen as a person that abuses women or see them at just objects i wanna see them as real human beings but everyone in this world wants to prove me wrong but see i dont know how to deal with that because i was never taught to stand up for my self i was taught to ignore the problem and be a lazy stereotypical american so there is my opinion please comment if i left anything out or if i am wrong or if you just have questions please ask dont be afraid\ud83d\ude04",

I personally would never have voted for Trump (if I lived in the US) and I can't pretend to understand women who do. BUT, and it's an important but, I 100% respect the right for women to choose exactly what they want to do. That is the true nature of a democracy, and that is apparently what feminism is fighting for. So while I have completely different political opinions to Appell, I think she's totally spot on in that belittling people because they have different beliefs is never ok, no matter how passionate you are about your own.\n\nThe one thing that I do find problematic with it is that it's billed as a message for 'all liberal feminists'. Actually, not every liberal feminist necessarily agrees on such sweeping statements as those made by people in the public eye on our behalf. Just like putting all conservative feminists in a box would be too sweeping a generalisation, that applies to the left as well.",

                    "commentText": "@Progressive Resource Center So from my perspective, the problem isn't with men - I appreciate some people are quite ardent and give this impression and I'm sorry on their behalf and disagree with them.\nI suppose as an analogy... consider dresses. Thousands of years ago, togas and dress-like clothes were perfectly acceptable for men or women to wear. Over time, dresses became something that we associate with women and femininity. So given history, dresses aren't essentially feminine, but nowadays, if a man wears a dress, there are a lot of places in which they would be ridiculed or called a <b> sissy </b>and whatever. But my perception of it is that they're only called that because it's something that's associated with being feminine or a<b>  woman</b> in this day an<b> d ag</b>e. This isn't something that's associated exclusively with dress. Things like telling someone they 'throw like a girl' implies that women are just naturally... lesser. I'm not denying there are biological differences, but my perception is that people use being female or feminine as an insult in a way that being masculine or a man just isn't. I haven't ever heard someone be told 'you're so manly' in the slightly disapproving way that 'you're so girly' definitely is.\n\nSo for me, it's about these little things, because little things add up. I don't think that out in the open, people are generally against women. But I think there are a lot of things about the way our society have developed that we just haven't questioned yet, and it would be better for all of us if we do. I think all these ideas also put unrealistic expectations on men to be 'manly' instead of just being who they are and not living up to someone else's expectations.\n\nI hope you can understand my point of view, and I would be really interested to hear yours. I'm really enjoying discussing this - it's so nice to discuss opinions in a reasoned manner :)",

It gives dysfunctional and hateful individuals a public platform to gather/take on board like-minded people inflating destructive and mentally damaged notions. The more people of the same disposition agree with them the more likely they are to believe their bubble of reality to be reality and they take this with them into the educational system. Now we see 'teachers' pushing-their opinions on students basically indoctrinating them into their way of thinking, often through disingenuous methods. Before the internet individuals would have to interact physically with each other so destructive, illogical or antisocial views/behaviour would be contested or ignored forcing that person to reevaluate their opinions and perspective in order to be accepted and hopefully resulting in a more balanced and sociable disposition.",

I do not want to live in a <b> gender </b>neutral society.  This whole treating everyone the same should be treating everyone with respect and kindness. We are not all the same.

For decades he's  made sexist, objectifying  comments about us. If that and the<b>  sexual</b> assault allegations don't turn your stomach, I can't  understand why not. Are you too proud? Being downtrodden and lectured by others- has it made you spiteful? Are you too stubborn to even consider change? Many traditional values make no sense to me. If anyone would like to explain their feelings, I'd love to hear it.",

Oh and also, women and men are equally as smart. The global iq between men and women is identical. The reason men are usually better when it comes to IT and STEM fields is because that's usually how they educate themselves. Men and women are different, but saying that men are superior is a down right sexist thing to say.",

But something has gone terribly wrong, because the little boys are NOT becoming good obedient husbands.  As planned.   They are becoming basement dwelling, video game playing, slackers.  Many times, I have heard young ladies of marriage and childbearing ages say 'There are no good men around'.  In cities full of young males.\n\nLadies, you have released males from the massive social pressures to become husbands, fathers and providers.   Males love to slack and they are not coming back.  You blew it!  Get used to being alone!",

You should check out this goofy web show in starting (no I'm not spamming, I'm specifically saying this to you not posting this everywhere with no rhyme or reason). The first episode is just a dark comedy pilot, but the episode I'm about to post within the next few days has jokes similar to your library situation haha, and perhaps you'll like it. Either way.

If they were not placed exactly where they are then life on Earth would not be possible (scientific fact). So not only are you saying that the universe somehow mysteriously created itself (out of <b> nothing)</b> but the Earth, Moon and Sun placed themselves at exactly the right distances from one another to support life on Earth. THEN life somehow spontaneously created itself out of<b>  nothing</b>. There are alot of holes in your belief system there. Evolution is scientifically and statistically impossible therefore simple logic says that there has to be a God. Not to mention the fact that there is historical, geological and archeological evidence for God and the Bible.",

What is known now by science, would you create a religion? You see our planet as one of billions of billions planets solarsystem planets and yet everything was placed purposefully for you instead of accepting that out of those billions of planets there might be one or some, that allow organisms develope.

Traditionally, women couldn't act like that because it would be a one way trip to social suicide.  This is damaging to those women's lives and to society as a whole.

I think it's a case of them hating the men of their culture and being excited by men of a foreign culture.  They don't really care if it's a million times more oppressive.  They want to embrace it because it seems exciting and new.  What they don't know is that reality is very different from their romanticized view.",

            "commentText": "I can't believe people sometimes. This guest is saying that feminism is about rights for all women except the ones who disagree with them. That isn't true. People who voted for Trump are disrespecting themselves, because they are not making the decision that is best for the people. Trump has literally BRAGGED about sexually assaulting women, and say what you want about that, that would be reason enough for me not to vote for him. That isn't the only bad thing he's said though. He has made SO many <b> racist,</b> sexist comments that I can't even count them all, and he is locking up children at the moment but no one seems to care because they're \"not ours\" and \"the parents should have seen this coming, they came here illegally.\" Back to the topic of feminism though. Feminism is about living your live how you want to, with respect for yourself AND the others around you. Voting for Trump is not simply living your life how you want to, or having respect for yourself and everyone around you. You've heard him talk, you know what he's said, you KNEW what you were doing when you voted for him. You still did it. You have NO IDEA how many people's lives you have put in jeopardy, how many people you may have deprived of BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS. My hope is that you realize your mistake before it's too late. (by the way, I really don't want to hear all the hate comments about \"leftie feminist\" bs because I am a feminist and if you don't like it, sorry I don't live my life to please you, I live it to please myself)",

Being a man is not some easy little cake walk that they have you believe, maybe so if your born under a rich or wealthy family with good genetics and $$$ to boot.  Even those men had to get out and do something in most cases but not all.      That's the minority though.......the majority of ordinary men are people working right beside most women in today's America not making any more money then they are and they get a double standard thrown at them every single day in multiple directions.   You'll hardly ever see a avg. guy say anything bad or negative about a avg<b>  woman</b> just minding her own and doing her own daily thing.     There are so many double standards that exist from the court system that it's like watching a running punch line at the family court pat day office.    If they has a mens and womens door it would be like watching the opposite of a ball game restroom scene..................the men's line would be the one backed up to the seats lmfao",

You know, when you create a definition and an image, you have to CONSTANTLY work to maintain the good image, constantly repair the bad bits and keep pushing for making the image look good and if you belong to this group, it is yours as a group RESPONSIBILITY to keep the loud minority quiet, the ones that ruin the image. Every group has that bad loud minority, but they keep them down, while feminists keep letting those badmouthers ruin the image. So when the actions of feminists and the definition alligns, that's when it's right. That's when feminism is exactly what the definition implies. \nYou've gotta understand it doesn't matter what the definition is if more than you think number of feminists don't act it out",

It actually focuses on a ball of string in the meaning men as those women have actually believe their own lied that same is happening to them. People who actually still support feminism and think that it's still needed in the United States or actually cringe-worthy. There are no more problems for females and no more problems fo<b> r gende</b>r equality. feminism now what day has became such a joke as what they are fighting for has already been achieved by people who actually are intelligent unlike you who seems to not understand the fact that feminism has became a complete joke and it's actually ridiculously provocative and it gets the point now where people wa<b> nt nothi</b>ng to do with you if you are a feminist. that is much different from <b> the wo</b>man who fought for equal rights in the 1970s. Unlike you who probably copied and pasted a bunch of Wikipedia information and the stating incorrect facts to back up your stupid and illogical thinking. F*** off",

Almost like a propaganda against feminism. It has repeated itself throughout history, where people discredit a large movement doing good things by making the bad aspects or bad individuals seem like they are the majority or all that the movement stands for, and that simply isn't true. Feminism is about equality between the sexes, fighting against toxic masculinity so that our men don't suffer, its about<b>  race</b> equality and general human rights because without things like that, how can women be equal? There are so many women out there, ones I know, that have dedicated their lives to bettering society and helping both men and women gain equality. Not once have I met a \"pop feminist\".",

Your movement has been hijacked by misandristic women who hate men and have only agenda, Male subjugation. The narrative has changed, attitude has changed. Nowadays feminist cannot tolerate opinions of the opposite end of the spectrum. The attitude is either my way or the high way. They blame everything on men. I am a doctor by profession, and as a humanist the idea of subjugation of a group, playing group identity politics in order to create a division in the society which alienates men from women for political mileage is unacceptable to me.",

Like hey people we are equal to boys, we aren't their children",

The liberal feminists are technically more feminine in the way they act (they're squeamish, girly, and rely on others to protect them) whereas the conservative women all think they're men and try to do everything we do. Where I live we have \"country girls\" who go hunting, fishing, hang out with the boys and try to do everything we do without realizing that they're making themselves appear more masculine and in turn, less attractive.\n   A <b> woman'</b>s place in society is to be fragile and delicate, to be motherly, loving and caring. To appear weak, yet strong enough to stand by (behind) her husband against all odds. Bottom line, women belong in the kitchen, wearing a skirt, and doing the hardest job in the world which is being a house-wife. That is what makes a<b>  woman</b> strong, when she accepts the fact that God made her the weake<b> r se</b>x, and salvation is through her husband; hence the biblical reason she takes on the man's last name. \nIt even says in the Bible that women are emotionally weaker, and are more easily tempted by the devil to destroy man's relationship with God. That they would become confused about the differences between men and women, and attempt to become men themselves without realizing that they are only destroying their relationship with their children who no longer see them as their caring mother. The end of the world is coming, you can tell just by watching the world around you, and not soon enough if you ask me.",

This is the reason so many of us democrats voted for Trump and more of us are jumping on the Trump train every day becouse of the lies being told about him in the media. Also the democrats are in attack mode instead of creating policy. Add to that the socialist movement within the party and we have Trump getting re-elected",

And the reason you keep getting lectured about it is because everyone tried to warn you that this was NOT an intelligent choice but here you done fucked up and do it anyway and forces us all to put up with this circus for 4 years based on YOUR ignorance that you took to a voting booth.\n\nYou wanna be viewed as intelligent?  Then try making intelligent choices.  I agree that everyone in Hollywood can absolutely go f off, we don't need their damn validation for anything.  But that's not what it's about.  It's about how the overwhelming majority of actually smart people screamed from every rooftop not to do this for more reasons than I have time to list and yet here we are anyway thanks to your bitterness, nihilism, and disillusionmemt.\n\nTrump supporters may not actually be stupid or low IQ or whatever.......but many of them are/were \"disaffected\" or disillusioned and succumbed to a certain flavor of kool-aod too.  You say you don't want to be told what to do........well why The he'll did you let Trumps bombast and demagoguery fool you into voting for him.  I don't have to respect it.  If you were given a multiple choice test with choices A through D.....and NONE of them were the \"correct\" choice........you are still obligated as a citizen to at least not choose the WORST of those just because you want to watch others get mad and because you just view the whole thing through the lens of hopeless nihilism.  \n\nAnd the reason people get so \"triggered\" about it is because to those of us who saw it.......we saw it within 2 minutes of hearing Trump talk about literally ANYTHING.  I don't need to be a clinical psychologist to tell you the guy is not of the right mix of attributes for president REGARDLESS of any of his specific political stances.  Yet no matter how we tried to explain this we all still let this drag on and on.  We thought you'd see it for yourselves at some point during the campaign, that we wouldn't need to worry, his lunacy was intuitively obvious, that reason would won the day and so we blew him off like you should do for any clearly unfit candidate...........and yet here we are.",

They both suck, but man, it just seems like it would've been worse with hillary..  Most of the hillary or trump voters were just confused lmao, because it indeed was the weirdest election and full of surprises. If I was american, I would be lost as to what to vote for.. I hate that trump is pro-war on drugs, and while the liberal left could have gone to that side, they have radical fems which are way more scary.",

She is only 12, and probably didn't know what she was getting into.\nSomeone who is capable of doing this, but not getting into trouble for it (if you search it up by the way there's not that much evidence you can find) is definitely capable of lying straight to the audience, and winning the whole election, just to go on and do something completely idiotic and <b> dumb.</b>\nThey have also found that she had tried to cheat to win the election, however they didn't let her cheat that much because then it would look un-realistic.\nI am not saying Trump is amazing. I honestly think Bernie Sanders should've won the election. It's just that most people accuse him of the wrong things.\nFor example, A LOT of people accuse him of the wall, however, all he is doing is stopping countries under there from getting there illegally. \nPeople think: \"blah blah oh no trump built wall no one can come through blocking people from families\" but basically, he is not doing any thing wrong.\nIf you think about it, they are entering ILLEGALLY which means that basically, there already WAS a law that said they can't come through. All Trump is doing is making this law realistic, even if it might be in a pretty stupid way. \nThe real problem is how much money that will cost, which is why he was trying to get Mexico to pay for the wall. Now, this isn't the best idea, but a lot of bad things were happening if he hadn't done something to stop it. So he decided, since basically what they were trying to stop is Mexico coming in, and in order for this to work, Mexico has to agree. Otherwise the wall would be vulnerable as h***, so he asked Mexico to pay for the wall.\nAnd, yes, Trump has made some awfully stupid remarks before on *live TV!*, but listen. \n1. The man's 70 lol\n2. he looks like an<b>  alien</b>\n3. he was trying to make humor\n4. maybe wha he was sayin wa reeeeeeeeel? dk.",

Oh I know it was something that happened a very very long time ago where feminist at the time did not care about people of color until the second wave came around and now it's the third wave and everything is a disaster I honestly have a bad feeling it's going to take a long time for feminism to come to the countries that really do in fact need it because since we're nearing the end of the third wave which my prediction would be 2020 until the 4th wave starts who knows what's going to happen there but feminism is not about obsessing over this <b> gender </b>binary shit it's not about being a man-hater even though the third wave makes it look like that even I can admit that and feminism should not be about complaining about sexist video games it's supposed to be about equality and sadly the third wave have destroyed it also let's not forget to mention this male feminist I'm woke shit because we're already seeing all those male feminist harassing women I'm looking at you matt mcgorry with your rapey looking stare that<b>  nobody</b> seems to realize because they're to<b> o blin</b>d on how woke you are and my mom was a single parent and I'm sick of them trying to glorify it being a single mom isn't really horrible but boy was hard not to mention my father was<b>  a drug addi</b>ct and an abusive asshole but it was pretty hard for her to do it on her own so my grandparents had to help out so I really don't know how a third-wave feminist would honestly responded to that last paragraph because they would immediately react to the whole domestic violence thing but they would expect a single mother to raise her child on her own without any help that's honestly how I see them glorifying single motherhood I honestly would not glorify it even though I am proud to have a great mother honestly I would just be a feminist for the right reasons by defending other countries that need it then the west because we already have the freedoms in the west I'm honestly hoping the fourth wave cares about these issues instead of making a big deal of w<b> hat gen</b>der they are",

Why are you, Fox news who isn't even considered News playing back <b> old </b>tapes of Hillary for subject matter? This is one of many reasons why Fox isn't liked but on to this other bitch... You said \"We are tired of being told who to vote for because of<b>  gender</b>\".... Who told you that you as <b> a woma</b>n had to vote for anoth<b> er wom</b>an? Who... I need to know, provide me with you're studies and where you're getting that information from? See I'm not like most in this comment section who just accept what they're being told simply because it benefits their argument on their side which would be right in this case, I need you to give me sources where you're getting these argued points from, and secondly if at all you were being told who to vote for in terms<b>  of gen</b>der guess w<b> hich ge</b>nder would be telling you this... Guess? Yea, it would be other women, and why would they be the ones telling who to vote for? Maybe because their tired of seeing a man molest and degrade women like saying that he just grab<b> s the </b>Pussy of women, or who molested countless women (oh, I'm ready at a notice to give out my sources.. Where is yours) or how about incest views which point t towards him wanting to sleep with his daughter, how about him telling his porn star fling that she looked like his daughter before fucking her... How about this irresponsible and disrespectful nature towards marriage? Why are we dismissing these facts... Yup, facts not alternative facts but actual facts... No one, no one's wants to discuss this but hey, let's dig up countless meaningless bullshit about Hillary... A bitch no one cares about in order to bring up a story of any kind right. Fucking pathetic, and no bitch, the definition of being a feminist isn't for independent opinions you stupid... Very stupid cowardly just stupid person, last I checked it was to create opportunities for women in order to successful succeed in society. Fuck you guys are stupid is this really the source you guys get you're hype from? This is bad",

                    "commentText": "Nice one, my turn, here's my 7 COUNTERS to those. 1. A big myth, specially now in the Democratic world, where the white male can't even get a job causes he's not the following: a female or a person of diversity. Let me use a quote from a 2013 article by Hanna Rosin, she was the author of The End of Men. : \"The official Bureau of Labor Department statistics show that the median earnings of full-time female workers is 77 percent of the median earnings of full-time male workers. But that is very different than '77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men.' The latter gives the impression that a man and a <b> woman </b>standing next to each other doing the same job for the same number of hours get paid different salaries. That's not at all the case. 'Full time' officially means 35 hours, but men work more hours than women. That's the first problem: We could be comparing men working 40 hours to women working 35.\" -Slate Magazine, 2013 article.2. Is this really an argument, there's a difference between correctness and DECENCY! Also sun exposure to the breasts is not good for them, you gonna breast feed your kid cancer?\u00a0But\u00a0that still hasn't stop women from going topless during spring break or any other wild collage party.3. Now that a bold statement, people like Danica Patrick, Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova, Hope Solo (unless you count that incident with the Swedish team), would say otherwise. Also there's women's basketball, softball, women are a big part of the track and field events, Yes there's no women's football team, rugby team, or Ice Hockey(?), but it doesn't take a moron to know why, high contact sports, like Roller Derby are ROUGH, something most women can't handle physically.4. You can thank the new wave Feminism for that, before during the 20's-60's, yes it was legit, voting rights among other things, but nowadays new wave feminist want EVERYTHING to be<b>  Woman</b> owned, they want to get rid of the MALE, period. Plus the recent thing with Cosby doesn't make women look too good to th<b> e Blac</b>k Community right now, so start by fixing that.5.Women CAUSE t<b> he sexu</b>al culture in America, first<b>  by r</b>ace mixing, then making men do all the work and taking their paychecks as part of the \"child support\" deal you forced on him, when you cried to the court that he \"beats, and abuses you and your kids\" and some sad Liberal Judge feels sorry for you, then when you get the kids, fuck them they're just another asset you got, and daddy is fucked for life because of a big lie mommy told.6. Really? Both have to wear outrageous uniforms as it is, I don't see how this is also so when the PE clothing is the SAME THING, shirt and shorts. Maybe it's cause of those small skirts and thongs, or maybe those \"gangsta\" culture clothing that makes her look li<b> ke </b>a ho instead of a young lady. Dress codes wouldn't be needed if the parents stop being lazy asses and make sure their kids dressed decently, NOT IN THONGS, TUBETOPS AND SAGGING PANTS.7.Two words: W<b> onder </b>Woman, yes she was created by a man, but the idea came <b> from a</b> woman who the man saw inspiration for the creation, and just cause the female is tied up in ropes by the badguy, shes being sexualized? If that was the case then EVERY HERO would of been sexualized, specially Superman and Batman.The truth i<b> s this</b>, woman are know for destroying civilizations, how is this proven? You tried to get one into the president seat, one who know only has evidence of fucking over he<b> r fell</b>ow woman, (see Monika Lewinsky, and Mary Mahoney), evidence of her fucking over the country it's self(Benghazi) also the possible following: let a child rapist go free.

Islam as a religion I think is ok, but Islam as a law is what kills the faith itself. Im not Islamic but I have had Islamic friends, and In getting to know them, they have never shown to where they agree with Islamic extremism. Many seem to follow ever similar paths to christians.

You feel nervous since the person of a solid two feet taller and one foot wider than you, and you know that if you throw a punch or push away you'll lose the battle.\n\nThat's what this is about.  Some women are surprised to see other women endorse someone who has a history of making derogatory comments about women. It's not about party lines. If a male conservative who did not have such a history ran for the previous presidential election, this wouldn't even be a conversation. I may have even voted for them. \nIt is important to keep in mind that when you willingly vote for a person, that person is supposed to reflect you and you're values. I see that those who mentioned God and religion forget that God will not look with approval for anything that is vile. So please, I implore you, to keep these things in your mind when you are making a judgement.",

You have one party where they are for ignoring logic and basin their decisions on how people 'feel' while the other is for using logic and ignoring most forms of empathy. Both have their pros and cons but I believe that both parties would probably run America into the ground in the long run.    The fact that most of the people involved in these politics are either conservative or liberal doesn't help either because it just gives more room for pointless arguments. I try to stay away from any and all forms of politics because I just see it all to be unreasonable.",

It's none of your business, but I didn't vote for Trump. Yet, it doesn't make ANYONE less of anything if they did. You may think differently then them, but we have the freedom in the United States to make our own opinions!

You can admire and respect someone's opinion, but what about BASIC respect? Respect at a down to earth level,as in, let's say I share a political opinion on something and then people start telling me to eat shit and die, that's not basic respect.\nBasic respect is allowing someone to have their political beliefs and you have yours, and you can both discuss your opposing views on something civilly, that is basic respect, the Golden rule.\n\nI am starting to think that the term 'SJW' is also being used to shut people up,here's a scenario:\n\nA man starts screaming and berating a person who believes there are 2 genders scientifically, but you can identify as anything among a group of friends or people you talk too, but does that mean we should throw them against the wall and beat into their heads that their are only 2 genders, and not let them identify as anything else socially? No.\n\nNow, if someone screams at you something like this, 'DID YOU ASSUME MY <b> GENDER?</b>!' When you first meet him/her and don't know what they want to be called yet, just walk away.\nBut if they correct you like this,\n'Oh\u2026I'm sorry,but, is it ok if you call a (blank) instead of boy/girl?' (Or something similar to that)\nI think you should just call them what they want to be called, as long as they aren't screaming at you like a banshee.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm told by republicans that I'm an 'SJW' or 'facts don't care about your feelings' although that, to an extent, is true, but it shouldn't be used in a manner to shut people up. People have been silencing me using these phrases. There are SJW's on both sides of the spectrum, because BOTH sides use terms and phrases to shut people up. If you want to identify as something other then boy/ girl, I really don't care ok, you do you, I don't care.\nI don't know, are all republicans like that? I've had a pretty bad experience with all of the ones I've meet so\u2026are there any republicans who just like civil debates anymore? \ud83d\ude10",

The economy is better than ever, and the wall is already in the process of being built. He has stayed true to his words and promises made during the 2016 election. He even recently halted a war between America and Iran because he was concerned about how many people would be killed as a result of it. (Yet the media still had negative things to say about him.<b>  Nothing</b> he does is righteous in their eyes.) He is mostly rational with his decisions. These modern democrats are not in the slightest. Trump has done all of this and more in only 4 years.

It's a generalization of a large group of people who happen to have the occasional nut job lurking in the corner. We all knew it was Manafort as far as I can tell. Trump both fired him in 5 months and then put distance between. He was being investigated for years before the campaign. We knew it was coming for him eventually.

The second the story broke on CNN friday night, every right wing propaganda site started spewing hours of clinton bashing and speculation, including your beloved FAUX... If you missed that, maybe your fingers aren't so much on the pulse as they are plugging your ears..  \n\n\"Ya'll\" is FAUX and King Cheeto's white knighting, alt-righting, alternative facting, bible thumping, gun toting, flag waving AND wearing, tea-partying, neo-nazi-ing, science denying, <b> homophobic,</b> nationalistic, misogynistic, greedy, angry, selfish, jealous, deplorable miscreants whom instead of taking responsibility, want to swiftboat every single trump scandal... (perfect example... you believe weinstein's accusers, but not Trumps? convenient, no?..)\n\nIf you don't fall into any of those categories, don't stand shoulder to shoulder with them and you wont get caught in the cross hairs... Blaming it on a \"few nutjobs\" when trumps loudest and most prominent supporters are white supremacists and corporate America is not only some form of denial, it's recklessly delusional... The shitheads know what they stand for and what the party is about... You're the nutjob in the corner if you don't believe obama is a Kenyan Jew/Muslim born on mars and hillary doesn't run a child<b>  sex</b> operation.... again... if you don't want to be lumped in with these people, don't stand shoulder to shoulder with them... simple as that...\n\nFurthermore, I have explained repeatedly why this comment is here... but since you missed it over and over and over again, I'll repeat it for you...  FAUX took an hour longer than any other outlet to break the story Monday morning... they needed time to figure out the spin and they dropped the ball... had they not, I'd be talking about the cackling hens in the FAUX echo chamber spouting the Murdoch machine's talking points about how the national feminist movement is just evil Hillary and the democrats trying to take away your precious right to be a stay at home bimbo; when the reality is that domestic violence is a major issue in rural (ie. trumpland) America.. and libs believe getting beaten and harassed to be part of a backward, future-less culture shouldn't be women-of-the-rights only option... It saddens me conservatives see things differently.. but that's what this is all about, right? Out with th<b> e ol</b>d, in with the new... progression, ya'll... winter is coming :D",
