        "postText": "'Mr Austin, who is standing down as an MP told the BBC's Today Programme that Jeremy Corbyn is completely unfit to lead our country. He said the party he was a member of for 34 years has become poisoned by racism, extremism and intolerance under Corbyn\u2019s leadership. Mr Austin was a Labour MP for Dudley North from the 2005 general election until he resigned from the party in February this year to sit as an independent.', 'His shocking announcement today has followed Tom Watson\u2019s resignation last night as deputy leader of the Labour Party.', 'However, it can now be revealed that in 2014 Mr Austin called on the Labour Party to admit opening up borders and allowing uncontrolled immigration from eastern Europe in 2004 was a mistake and insisted the leadership should apologise.', 'His comments came after the Labour leader at the time, Ed Miliband, had been asked by David Cameron in the Commons to apologise for the 2004 decision.', 'Mr Milliband had previously said it was an error, but stopped short of apologising.', 'However, Mr Austin insisted: If you make a mistake, you should say sorry. Let's be honest about it.', 'He also called on Mr Milliband to take a tougher approach to migrants\u2019 rights and duties.', 'He claimed that they should not receive benefits until they had worked and paid taxes and that immigrants should be required to speak English.', 'The Labour veteran even argued that British citizens should find it harder to claim welfare to encourage them to compete with migrants for work.', 'Mr Austin added: When I say these things, people are surprised to hear an MP say it.', 'It\u2019s not a revelation to say that we are not universally trusted on this issue.', 'We have to work hard to persuade people on this. I don\u2019t want to be seen as criticising Yvette [Cooper, then-Shadow Home Secretary] or anyone.', 'Labour has always had to work hard to be trusted on this issue.', 'Mr Austin is a former aide to Gordon Brown and was a Treasury adviser when the Blair government decided to allow people from new members of the EU to freely enter the UK.', 'Of this decision, he said: It was a mistake. I said so at the time. I did not think it was the right thing to do.', 'Mr Austin, who represented a constituency in the Labour heartland of the Midlands, said he made these comments after holding a dozen public meetings in Dudley to ask people about immigration.', 'He said: I am not here to say this is Labour policy. I am here to say people in Dudley have raised the issue, it\u2019s my job to say something about it.', 'Mr Austin, who held off the Tories by just 22 votes in the 2017 election, warned three years before the knife-edge vote that the big parties are struggling to convince the public on immigration.', 'To illustrate this, he highlighted the rise of Ukip, which peaked at 24 percent of the vote in Dudley North in 2015.', 'Earlier this year, Mr Austin resigned from the Labour Party in the same week as The Independent Group was formed by other defectors, but he did not join, saying he disagreed with their desire for a second Brexit referendum.', 'Today, in an emotional interview with Nick Robinson he said: The Labour Party has been my life, Nick, it\u2019s been my life.', 'I can\u2019t believe it has come to this, but I have to tell the truth and I have do what\u2019s right.', 'It\u2019s a really difficult decision and I\u2019ve really grappled with this\u2026', 'But if you\u2019re not going to what\u2019s right on a fundamental question like racism, what are you going to do it on?'",

What should have happened a long time ago is that the UK should have made unemployment benefits time limited and only to those who have made tax contributions, the same as other western nations. The nanny state has now grown exponentially to the detriment of the tax payers. The signing by May of the migration pact recently means that this country is now the 'streets are paved with gold' for any new arrivals.",

An apology is hardly ample enough contrition, besides which LibDem and Tories are equally as guilty and all of that trinitys voters are the ones truly responsible for what went on!

And he has still not finished despite no longer being in office he is continuously trying to overturn a Democratically arrived at Referendum Result.",
