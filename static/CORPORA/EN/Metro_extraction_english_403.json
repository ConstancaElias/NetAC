        "postText": "It is a pretty basic concept that the only people who are responsible for promoting racism and hatred are the bigots themselves.', 'Yet this seems to be something Tony Blair does not understand.', 'According to his latest public intervention, where he offered his pearls of wisdom on how to combat the rise of the far-right, the burden is on migrants and minorities to do \u2018more to integrate\u2019.', 'His comments are a slap in the face if minorities and people of colour who, like myself, have been victims of far-right hatred.', 'He needs to learn it is the purveyors of hate that need changing, not their victims.', 'A failure to recognise this most basic of points not only shows a complete lack of awareness of how racism operates, but also whether intentional or not, legitimises white supremacists in a dangerous climate where we are increasingly told the \u2018far-right has a point\u2019.', 'By placing the responsibility on minorities to atone for the crimes of the far-right, Blair and others are basically saying, \u2018I\u2019m blaming you for what\u2019s happened\u2019.', 'The far-right cannot be appeased, no matter what, and asking minorities to \u2018do more\u2019 to try to, fails to recognise that no matter we do, the far-right will not accept us. Its ideology is rooted in the denial of our very existence.', 'The fact that a man we used to call our prime minister fails to see any of this is shameful.', 'The truth is, successive governments haven\u2019t been neutral, instead creating a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 towards immigrants and reducing opportunities for integration, while at the same time repeatedly shouting \u2018more must be done\u2019.', 'There is no difference to what Blair is saying and what the far-right thugs of Britain First and the EDL repeatedly told us during their marches on the streets of Luton: that minorities and Muslims in particular are a threat to our nation.', 'Blair has just aped their rhetoric.', 'Despite the headlines about people in Britain leading increasingly segregated lives, there is increasing evidence that cultural integration is on the rise as opposed to being on the reverse.', 'According to one study that has looked into it, \u2018Neighbourhood residential integration is increasing. Segregation, the extent to which an ethnic group is evenly spread across neighbourhoods, has decreased within most local authority districts of England and Wales.\u2019', 'Even more, the likes of Tony Blair and others who focus solely on migrants and minorities when it comes to integration, always conveniently forget to talk about the concept of \u2018white flight\u2019 from neighbourhoods like my own.', 'As soon as Asian families moved in, many of our white neighbours who had more resources at their disposal moved out.', 'Although we often hear the idea of integration being a \u2018two-way street\u2019, it\u2019s clear that the overwhelming majority of times, as proved by Blair\u2019s latest intervention, the burden is solely placed on ethnic minorities alone.', 'Blair goes on to argue that the government cannot and should not \u2018be neutral\u2019 on the question of integration.', 'The truth is, successive governments haven\u2019t been neutral, instead creating a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 towards immigrants and reducing opportunities for integration, while at the same time repeatedly shouting \u2018more must be done\u2019.', 'To name but just one example, when David Cameron threatened to deport people like my own mum for not speaking English, the hypocrisy was all too clear, for when she tried to learn, funding for English classes had been cut by \u00a345million.', 'We also have to ask what exactly are migrants supposed to be integrating into? There is no concrete acceptance of what \u2018British values\u2019 are for example.', 'I\u2019m yet to discover what the innate \u2018norms and values\u2019 white Britons already have that the rest of us don\u2019t.', 'The most tragic aspect of Blair\u2019s comments is his failure to recognise white supremacy and the very real threat of the far-right for what it is: an ideology that denies the existence and worth of people of colour because of their race, and one which cannot be defeated by legitimising their rhetoric.",

You seem to suggest that minorites are immune from criticism and forget that majorities have rights too. And your sense of entitlement is beyond belief. This really takes the biscuit -\"when David Cameron threatened to deport people like my own mum for not speaking English, the hypocrisy was all too clear, for when she tried to learn, funding for English classes had been cut by \u00a345million.\"Is it really too much for your mother to pay in full for her own English classes in order to be able to contribute and mix in? If that's the best example (and it's the only one your provide) then the problem here isn't <b> racism,</b> it's solipsism - YOURS.",

I've lived in Thailand for 9 years, the immigration laws are far stricter here despite there being no social help, the school's are privatized schools, hospitals are privatized , no free language courses, and no social housing, yet when I ever suggest that the UK could learn something from the way Thais deal with immigration (low skilled Thai workers being protected ) I've often been accused of <b> racism,</b> right wing leanings or<b>  xenophobia</b>.A large reason the genuine right wingers are increasingly gaining confidence is because if anyone ever questions mass migration they're immediately told they're either far right or appeasing them.... Just like the writer has done. For the record, Tony Blair is one of the worse offenders for allowing mass unskilled migration which the UK wasn't equipped for during the early 00s.",

Do you think it's okay that some English people in Spain don't learn Spanish? Would it be okay if they put the blame for their laziness on the Spanish for not paying for them to learn?",
