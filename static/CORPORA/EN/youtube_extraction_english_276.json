This is a distasteful low dirty tactic those<b>  remainers</b> are playing, with direct threats to British people.\n\n\nWe will have ou<b> r Brexi</b>t it's what we voted for but I see so much MSM news talking about loss of jobs and doom and gloom if we leave but that is all just talk by people who don't have a UK passport and they should stay out off what was supposedly a people's vote but now people are being threatened in all kinds of ways, these are sad times for U.K democracy.\nFord threatening jobs, Ford built trucks for the Nazis before and during WW2, after our brave pilots bombed those factories with horrendous losses, Ford claimed and won compensation for bei<b> ng Na</b>zi collaborators, we fought bravely then and we will now. \"NO TO THE U.K Being in the E.U.\"",

            "commentText": "I find many of the comments bellow damn right scary in their sheer misguidedness. \n\nNo, anti-Semitism is far from the preserve of muslim communities. A dear family friend of ours had bars fitted to his home windows to stop the bricks coming through from known BNP members, he was in his nineties when this happened.\n\nSpeaking of Leon, he had survived Auschwitz. His child and wife didn't. My grandfather never met his brother again. The historical evidence of the holocaust shouldn't need defending, how did this denial come to be? These comments alone show the serious problem of holocaust denial, the denial of six million deaths because people were judged purely on their <b> ethnicity.</b>  \n\nFurthermore, these jewish mancunians don't represent Israel and the very valid criticisms that many of them will also have. It is a shame this documentary didn't show the various views. The term zionist is also thrown around as if it is well defined. For many zionism means the eventual return to the homeland, there is<b>  nothing</b> of the theft of land from those who also live there. In other words there are many interpretations of this longing which is why self describing yourself as 'anti-zionist' plays into the hands of extremists on both sides whilst insulting a very many other people who are peaceful in their lives.\n\nIf you find yourself judging people on thei<b> r ethnicit</b>y, religion, or some other broad definition you have a serious problem. People among every community in Britain are far more diverse than the differences between the communities themselves. I really wish there was a little more self reflection, and reflection upon where people are getting their information.",

Islam is only criticised freely away from the mainstream media or mainstream society. To criticise it opens you up to being called a <b> racist.</b> Judaism is probably a bit more protected from criticism than Christianity among normal people but definitely not in the mainstream media. The media trashes Judaism all the time.",

            "commentText": "Wow. I found this so enlightening. I can see how being Jewish and exposed to anti-Semitism is so similar to being Muslim and exposed to Islamophobia, especially when you see  how such oppression can be fueled by the spread of propaganda which unfairly generalizes the extreme, violent behaviour of a few to that of an entire cultural group; be it conflating the actions of Isis to all Muslims, or the actions of the Israeli government to that of all Jewish people. I have to admit, I did not expect to see school kids internalizing their oppression; frightened because they truly believed the propaganda, that they were at risk of anti-semitic attacks from anyone who criticized the policies of the Israeli government. That was so sad. But, thank goodness the Guardian continues to explore and help us understand such complex issues. Very few of the other major media outlets make such efforts. As such, I truly believe that The Guardian is one our strongest and most effective tools in the fight to address anti-Semitism and all other forms of prejudice and discrimination around the world today",

Do you see Christians or Jews trying to establish a Theocratic state to conquer the world? Jesus was a pacifist, Mohammad was a warlord. Of course there are fundamentalist Christians and Jewish terrorists, but it's no comparison to Islamic terrorism. We've got to be able to criticize ALL bad ideas, not just the Christians or the Jews, but the Islamists who are stuck in the 9th century.

Israel wasn't re-established until 1948. Of course, Israel's re-establishment came about by a Walter Rothschild and the Balfour Declaration from November 1917, in which, President Carter wrote about through his book, \"Palestine Peace Not Apartheid.\" Of course, there is a NY Times article from July 1937 linking the Rothschild to Karl Marx by blood.",

That may be a reason why President Jackson didn't like the Rothschilds so much after taking over The Anti-Mason Party a year after President John Quincy's term ended. Of course, there was that assassination attempt against President Jackson's life when he was trying to stop The Rothschild Bankers with their plans for establishing a central bank here in the U.S. If the Rothschilds along with other bankers are behind the creation of our Private Federal Reserve Banks here in America as G.
