        "postText": "Holding hands in public for the majority of people is something that they can take for granted. And rightly so.', 'However, for a select few of us it is an issue, simply because we\u2019re the same sex as the person we\u2019ve fallen in love with.', 'My fiance is much more comfortable with public displays of affection, so there can be times when there\u2019s a bit of friction because I don\u2019t want to hold his hand or kiss him when I see him.', 'But I\u2019m not alone, with more than two-thirds of LGBT people saying they don\u2019t want to hold hands because of the negative reaction.', 'We\u2019re a normal couple, so why can\u2019t we do normal couple things?', 'My theory, based on experience, is that it\u2019s because a significant portion of the population haven\u2019t yet grasped the fact that being gay is normal.', 'There\u2019s no point in kidding ourselves, there are parts of London that are no-go zones for gay people where even my fiance will let go of my hand.', 'It is a great city and one of the most welcoming places on the planet for gay couples, but we\u2019re living a lie if any of us think that gay-bashing doesn\u2019t happen.', 'My husband-to-be and I have been walking down the street in cosmopolitan areas when we\u2019ve had \u2018batty boy\u2019 uttered at us from complete strangers just because we are holding hands.', 'You tell your straight friends about this and many of them are genuinely shocked that this is the case, even in a city as open and brilliant as London when it comes to gay rights.', 'It doesn\u2019t matter that we can walk past hundreds of people who don\u2019t bat an eyelid. What sticks in the mind is the man who deliberately walks between you in order to stop you holding hands.', 'I arrived in London several years ago and hoped that it would mean a new era for me to be who I am. Finally, I could hold another boy\u2019s hand in public.', 'However, within a couple of weeks of moving in, I had my first experience of homophobia.', 'The devastating thing about it was that we were on our way home from Pride and were crossing the Golden Jubilee Bridge \u2013 right in the heart of London \u2013 to look at the London Eye in the rainbow flag colours with the sun setting in the background over Westminster Palace.', 'But as we walked past a group of teenagers on the bridge one of them said in a loud and aggressive voice, \u2018That\u2019s disgusting. How can you be gay like that?\u2019', 'It is difficult for many who know me to imagine this as I\u2019m confident and am not afraid of confrontation, but I recoiled, let go of my boyfriend\u2019s hand and watched over my shoulder to see if they were following us.', 'Nearly a decade later, reinforced by other homophobic comments, I\u2019m still watching over my shoulder.', 'How do we stop this?', 'Keep going the way we are. Change doesn\u2019t just happen overnight, but as far as being a gay man in the modern day, there\u2019s no place I\u2019d rather be.",
