        "postText": "The biggest night in Hollywood has sparked yet another debate over race and the \u2018white saviour complex\u2019 as Green Book won best picture at the Oscars.', 'Spike Lee \u2013 who grabbed the award for best adapted screenplay for BlacKkKlsansman \u2013 reportedly \u2018stormed out\u2019 when Green Book won the award on Sunday night and I wasn\u2019t surprised nor could I fault him for it.', 'For starters, Green Book is a biopic about a black man that focuses on a white man and like Spike, I am exhausted \u2013 and bored \u2013 of watching Hollywood pat themselves on the back for pushing a \u2018black movie\u2019 while simultaneously erasing the voices of the central characters.', 'The Oscars can and must do better.', 'In case you missed it: Green Book, which stars Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen, beat off competition from the likes of Black Panther, Bohemian Rhapsody, Roma, A Star Is Born and Spike\u2019s own BlacKkKlansman to scoop the coveted best picture award.', 'In the midst of Black Panther and Spike\u2019s film \u2013 both incredible projects focused on the lives of black characters \u2013 Green Book seemed like the typical choice for an Oscar win, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the status quo isn\u2019t a problematic annoyance.', 'Directed by Peter Farrelly, Green Book follows a white man, Tony Lip (Mortensen) who drives around an African-American pianist, Dr Don Shirley, on a concert tour in the Deep South during the 1960s.', 'Admittedly it is a \u2018beautiful\u2019 watch \u2013 considering the fact that I laughed, winced and felt extremely anxious before I could even complain about the \u2018white saviour trope\u2019.', 'On paper, the movie is a \u2018good\u2019 one and Ali \u2013 who won the award for best supporting actor \u2013 acted the heck out of his role as Don Shirley.', 'But sadly the story focused on a less accomplished cab-driving Tony, his background, his awful manners, and his very racist family.', 'Don Shirley\u2019s extraordinary life and existence was the second act of his own story and the main star was the self-redemptive Tony, who somehow figured out how to go from being casually racist to learning how to have a singular black friend.', 'These are the things that get awards, I see.', 'It barely gave due diligence to the experience of Don, a musical genius, who at times was not allowed to dine with the people who travelled and paid to watch him perform.', 'In fact, the actual Green Books \u2013 aka Negro Travelers\u2019 Green Book formerly known as The Negro Motorist Green Book \u2013 that the film was named after barely got a cameo, unless Tony was holding it in between scenes.', 'Rather, whenever Don had a problem \u2013 ie getting beat up by bigots \u2013 we learned about it when Tony \u2018saved him\u2019 from the situation before gifting viewers with his shallow critique on race relations in the US.', 'Despite the tears and giggles, the narrative was as shallow as a puddle in a desert because it stripped the real-life Don Shirley and African-Americans from starring in their own story.', 'This is telling as Ali collected the award for best supporting actor \u2013 surely that in itself is a red flag that something is really wrong in this supposedly post-racial society that we live in.', 'This would be a great point to mention that when I watched the film with my best friend, we were surrounded by cinemagoers in multi-cultural London who laughed hysterically at some of the most upsetting and violently racist scenes.', 'It leaves me to ask myself whether the Academy only favours black stories when told from the eyes of a white man or woman? Of course, Black Panther or Spike\u2019s film did not have to win Best Picture, but I find it very symbolic that the Marvel film celebrated for positive portrayal of black people lost out to the biopic about a black man told by a white man.', 'Black Culture \u2013 a term I have found myself increasingly uncomfortable with \u2013 is not a monolith, so it would be impossible for me to entirely and completely understand the displeasure descendants of slaves and African-Americans felt while watching Green Book.', 'As a Black Briton of Nigerian descent, I can emphasise with Spike and I hope one day the Oscars can too.",

I think this just smacks of complaining for complaining's sake, the oscars winners were more diverse than they have ever been (oh and don't use the word problematic ever, anyone who uses it comes across as an idiot as soon as they say it)",
