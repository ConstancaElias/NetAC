Whether you like it or not women will acquire honor and status for themselves alongside men in the best fields. This is about our dignity as a <b> gender </b>and dignity is not found in low-class labor fields. I am tired of hearing comments like yours, you know just as well as I do that your male ego and pride hates to see a<b>  woman</b> in a position of status and power and your comment is intended to keep women down as men have throughout most of human history. I am fully confident that if women filled as many spots as men do in low-status grungy jobs, there will still be sexist discrimination against them for pursuing the more respectable fields. This is because men hate to see intelligent women succeed and gain status in society, men want it all for themselves. \n\n\nMen are good at waste disposal, keep up the good work. Go ahead and die in wars too, you men cause these unnecessary wars so stop calling yourselves our protectors. Men commit most of the crimes too. For every benefit, you men think you offer women, just remember that every man was given his life by <b> a woma</b>n a<b> nd nothi</b>ng beats that as far as contribution to society. If working in waste disposal buys men the respect in society to uninhibitedly pursue other opportunities that advance his career and status, then why aren't women respected in the same way for giving men their lives?",

We were not even allowed to access the justice system in the event someone committed a crime again us. We were not allowed to own our own bank accounts or spend our own savings that took years to get since we did not get paid for our labor. Women used to make all of men's clothing from raw materials and it took us weeks to make a man just one garment. We did everything heavy and dirty around the house and yet we could not even own these houses. It is about time women climb the status ladder and regain some dignity. Men can continue to work in these dangerous and dirty jobs. I have a new statistic for you, 100% percent of childbirth deaths are women. That is right, all women who are pregnant with a male fetus will take a death risk in order to give a man his life.",
