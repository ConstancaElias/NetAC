        "postText": " Deepika talks about the how men in the Indian society are suffering due to the draconian Indian Penal Code which is made for the protection of women but ignores men and their issues. She addresses the Indian Dowry Act from the perspective of men. Deepika talks of men who are victimised and sustematically abused by laws that are made for women but are abused to victimise men. Deepika Narayan Bhardwaj is a Journalist, Anchor and a Documentary Filmmaker. Her first documentary \u2018Gramin Dak Sevak' was Jeevika All Asia Livelihood Film Festival 2009, student film winner. Her second documentary \u2018Youth Count' was broadcast on India's leading News channel NDTV 24x7.

As a matter of fact it's a high-risk endeavor. Simply, 55% of marriages fail, 74% of marriages are initiated by the wife. In the divorce the man will lose half of all he's worked for  to that point and usually a lot more.\nThe wife the lawyers and the judges won't just try to make it the best they can for the children, they will label this Man a Pariah a criminal and legally proceed against him in that fashion!\nSo if you had a 50 to 75% chance of failure ripping your life apart what halfway intelligent man would participate?.",

This MGTOW movement that's going on seems to be growing exponentially. How is that going to turn out. I shudder to think. It appears that society is collapsing world wide. Couple that with the growing gap between those that have and those that have without, climate change, lack of meaningful employment, access to education, clean drinking water, food and wholesale destruction of the environment, the world is starting to look very bleak indeed. I'm not saying men are great and are not to blame, but as soon as you want to open a discourse, you are shouted down and grouped with the perpetrators of mass violence and abuse.",

Men protected women and children and women civilized men. That seems to be all gone now. The vision I refer to can seem pessimistic but I see bits if it peeking around the corner. Who would protect women and more importantly who will civilize men?

When I told the teacher she didn't believe me even though I had evidence that she had been ruining my school stuff and taking my school stuff. After that the girl provoked me and I went insane and broke her backpack and the teacher believed her that I was the reason that I broke her backpack. The assistant teacher came to me and she was the only teacher I believed in. She was the reason I didn't go to depression. Everyone in my class laughed at me and from then on I had no friends and it was the worst year of my life. I have to admit that a year later I bullied kid because I couldn't hold all the anger that was inside me. And from then on I am trying to keep it in I want to change myself and be nice.",

You can't have any expectations of decency from them and the moment things get heated up, a threat of going to the police and filing a dowry harassment case is made. I am not suffering as badly as Mr Sayed Mohammed suffered but I am certainly a victim of the side effects of these laws. The law being completely biased means that men have very little recourse if they end up marrying someone who won't adjust or cooperate or live peacefully with them. Either they suffer the indiginties quietly or get theirs and their families name dragged through the mud or go through long and hard battles while being humiliated. Its a sad sad state of affairs.",

Instead of saving marriages, the number of divorces has increased because once the wife goes to police station, any hope of compromise or reconciliation ends. Wonder if there is any data on the percentage of marriage saved due to this law. Once 498a is filed that is the end of marriage.  Rest of the exercise is for benefit of the wife and her family (settlement amount) judiciary and police.  Wish someone does analysis of the  money that is involved in completion of one case and the quantum of benefit - categorywise.",

When entire families are persecuted; children of such families grow up with complex personality and psychological issues -  what else do you expect from a <b> woman </b>who unscrupulously uses the judicial system to settle personal scores. Our leaders talk of becoming super power in near future. How? With more than 50000 children being denied security warmth and guidance of a father.  May be psychologists should analyse the situation. They would be in better position to predict India's future",

But in such cases judiciary do discriminate due to some laws as you mentioned. Ofcourse there should be someone like you who could think from other side(our side) too. Numbers you shown are really terrifying. Your video reminds me one incident just happened in train. One guy in gent's compartment of local train distributing sweets coz he got divorce. He was very happy and saying everyone is happy in his family and the pain was finally over after whole year since his marriage. I didn't get his happiness at that time but now I surely understood why was that happiness after watching all those  statistics. I had thought about such things could possible. But with such a big number. I am surprised",

Even still I believe if I called men to arms at middle of the city with a sword in hand and didn't even promise them women but retribution and vengence I feel they would show up, slowly at first, but after a while I would have a band big enough to make problems for police, about a month and I believe I could overtake country with support of those men. And I would have also support of about 40% of men worldwide. I see in I could count on guys from India to be as aggresive. Guy's you want me to create Empire built on men having enough?

I am divorced with 1/2 custody of the children. Arguments with her resulted in her hitting me, the police locked me up for being beaten. The judge said to me you are in America now you cant beat your wife like in India, I told him sir I was born in America and have never raised a hand against <b> a woma</b>n. The judge refused to accept the fact that<b>  a wom</b>an could beat a man. The family court system in the US is an abomination of justice, it is the polar opposite of Saudi Arabia on <b> the gen</b>der axis, but at least the Saudis are reforming their system. I see our system becoming more draconian where women are given counseling when they are caught in public beating their children. The thing about the double standard is that it is accepted. All of this needs to be put in the contex<b> t of ge</b>nder apartheid, it is the only way I can get through to people. I have also come to understand that democracy is two wolves and a sheep deciding on what is for dinner. I am sure this is why our founders placed a particular importance on the judicial system to ensure that the law adheres to the constitution. The SCOTUS in our system has become a rubber stamp of the legislative branch and special interests. Just like Yoda said there is another I do believe there are two more checks and balances before all is lost.",

            "commentText": "Recently, I had a discussion when I was on a long trip in a car with 2 of my friends/roommates(<b> Indian </b>males) regarding Hrithik-kangana case. They said Hrithik is at fault & that is why Kangana is taking revenge on him in media, even though there is no single proof to support her claims. I am shocked by their opinion and that they were arguing with me because of what I said. I said to them \u2018we don't know exactly what happened between Hrithik & Kangana if at all something had happened, so it is not correct to blame Hrithik if there are no proofs or evidences to show against Hrithik' .One of them said Suzanne took Rs.400 cr as alimony for their divorce because he had affair/issue with Kangana. I said how do you know. He told he saw it in media news(not any credible videos to support that, only written news, even if she had taken money the reason can be different.) then I asked him that whatever reports in media is all true?!! He has no answer for that. If he believes that Suzanne took rs.400 cr because it is reported in media then why doesn't he support that Hrithik is innocent which Hrithik himself claims in media?!! The other guy said \u2018something might have happened during some raining night', he is making fun out of it!!!! This is not funny at all, what if Hrithik is really innocent in this matter... then people like them are ruining his image in public.We had discussion like this on this topic for about 20-30 min, we stopped later. I felt inside that I had a horrible time with them & I shocked to see that some educated people like them support a girl at face value, not taking evidences or facts into consideration. I haven't spoken to them later & I probably won't in future.",

            "commentText": "When I was in college, I heard one night that a guy and a girl were shouting really bad profanities at each other. We just laughed it off and went to bed. Here is how things escalated. The guy was a <b> senior,</b> so verbal abuse was used to frame a ragging case against him. The use of profanities were used to device rape threat accusation. Of course,<b>  nobody</b> cared that the girl also shouted back awesome swears. Very interestingly, on the same day a students union group with mainstream political association came with demonstrations and all for expelling the guys. Almost too quickly a channel heavily biased towards the same political party, started flashnewsing this with his name, department & bach, native address and magically 'rape threat' became 'rape attempt' while reporting. Media did a very convincing job so that the whole neighborhood and extended family of the guy was informed that he was a criminal. Of course, the identity\u200b of the 'victim' was never revealed, s<b> o nobod</b>y (except the students in the uni) knew she (a budding young politician) was the daughter of (guess what) a very influential politician of the same party involved. These two where from the same state, so the students association of that particular state tried to make\u200b peace. Girls in the association started to get anonymous rape threat texts and phone calls, and boys got beaten up in the hostels. As per the Uni's law, she should have complained to university authorities first and then with their knowledge and approval should she have complained to the police. So she was also suspended along with the accused, since she didn't approach the University before approaching the police or media. This hurt her pride so much that she and the students' party started a hunger strike.",

If that's not the case, then it means <b> nothing.</b> These suicides could be by married farmers in Maharashtra. \nBy your own admission, people believe what's written and showed in the media. Now given that the rest of the facts you've presented are related to harassment of men, anyone watching this video, if they aren't careful enough might attribute that suicide to harassment specifically. \n\nHow to fix this: If that was just a general graph on suicides, please add a clarifying disclaimer in the video when that portion shows up.",

            "commentText": "I have been reading the comments and as expected they are quite toxic. Allow me to pump some objective truth into some of the idiots among us. Women and men are important. BOTH important to life in every way. NO one person is better or worse than the other because of his or her genitals. Every single person has the right to life, safety and freedoms that will give them a comfortable life. Things like rape or other issues that violate the rights of any human are absolutely wrong and there should be appropriate justice. Everyone has the right to justice and to be heard. That being said, history has shown us that there was a trend of <b> misogyny </b>which lead to the establishment of feminism ie: a movement pushing for the equality of both genders instead of the notion that women were overall inferior to men. Of course there are people who have made Feminism into a terrible misandrist movement and then the more ignorant ones who let the 'bad apples' spoil the lot thereby allowing Feminism to become something horrendously inaccurate and far from what it was intended to be by believing and emphasizing on the messages preached by misandrists claiming to be feminists...but anyway, Feminism is still an important movement as it truly aims for the equivalence of women and men not domination over or neglect of the other. In all honesty, I do not think anyone should object to a movement that promotes the idea of equality for the human<b>  race</b> turning <b> a blin</b>d eye to something we are born with without choice - our genitalia. If the word \"Feminism\" alone triggers you then you ought to educate yourself on its true definition and purpose rather than the perverted version by misandrists and other \"humans\" who have muddied the term out of hatred. I am yet to see the day where humans can be heard and treated as humans rather than female or male with consequential biases stemming from stereotypes. Stereotypes are absolutely worthless and do very little in the way of progression. Human beings, please learn to love yourselves and your neighbours based on who they are as a living being rather than judging, abusing and stereotyping on trivial things li<b> ke gend</b><b> er, </b>sex, preferences and weak social constructs that bring more hatred, disharmony, limitations and conflict to life. It does not take any God or great force of nature to teach you the value of human life...if it does, then you are beyond repair. Know better, do better.",

Its not that my marriage broke- but I really loved the<b>  woman</b>, gave everything for the marriage- blinded and then lost my job while going through the trauma. My parents never stayed with us- still faced a lot of shaming. But I respect women, cause thats how my parents raised me and will continue doing so. Thanks Deepika.",

This is what leads to the ignorance of assumptions that women are equal to that of men in the developed world, due to these false stats.  DV is at 90% of women victims, under-reporting is actually drastically higher with women than it is with men.  These are facts, what you speak to is completely false.  As for jails, that is men on men crime(no women are involved in raping men in prison), abortion in the USA is not medically covered, the amount of tits and ass I see on women comparative to men is astounding.  Just turn on your TV, its right in your face. Although suicide rates are higher for men that is specific to death related suicide.  Suicide attempts are far greater with women.  The reason for this is because men use much more lethal means to kill themselves than women do.",

If the parent teach their daughter to become faithful to her husband, i<b> t is not</b>hing like that. What we are talking are really modern problem, modernisation has started with modern western education. Just throw away this modern western education, which makes human being either behave like animals or take a decision of committing suicide. Women independence and Feminism are really western ideas. The traditional vedic society always respected women from any sect, because they were faithful their husband. But modern education has brought in all such issues. Instead of approaching this modern issue with modern ideas, where everyone's idea will be modernised, but approach it is a traditional way. Let husband take responsibility of wife and wife become faithful to husband. This is the solution for this.",

                    "commentText": "India seems to have had a worse problem with exaggerations in recent years.\nAccording to the <b> Indian </b>National Crime Records Bureau, in 2015 there were 34,651 rapes in 2015. Involving less than 0.006% of males in India. But this figure tends to be normally inflated due to new definitions including trivial incidents. So let's look at what rape is (in India). \nConsider a detailed six-month study of all 583 cases of alleged rape that came up before district courts in Delhi in 2013 (search for, thehindu+data+the-many-shades-of-rape-cases-in-delhi): \n20% of the cases were wound up because the complainant did not appear or turned hostile. Of the cases fully tried, over 40% dealt with consensual<b>  sex</b>, usually involving the elopement of a young couple and the girl's parents subsequently charging the boy with rape. Another 25% dealt with 'breach of promise to marry'. Of the 162 remaining cases, men preying on young children in slums was the mos<b> t commo</b>n type of offence.' And of these 162, the accused was known to the complainant in all but 12 cases. \nConsensu<b> al s</b>ex on a false promise/pretext of marriage is often reported as rape and then recorded by the police as such. In November 2014, the Mumbai police commissioner reported that 71.9% of rapes reported that year were related to consens<b> ual </b>sex that did not lead to marriage. In India, it is perfectly legitimate to pursue such cases.\nRecall the 0.006% of males in India figure; the percentage of seriously mentally ill males in India would be more than 10 times that figure, so what proportion of rapes would involve mentally ill perpetrators? This is ignored. Logic is ignored when feminist propaganda is concerned. The video on this page is feminist propaganda produced by feminists appealing for government grants.",

What I am also taking away from this talk is when a lot of people talk about women rights they don't talk about what oppression bring to the family of the women. I am encouraged to explore the lens of family. Although from my experience we still live in an era where a woman's family is not her's space once married. It will be interesting to explore the angle. I am an aware feminist (I am adding aware as a lot of people think feminism is bias towards women which is not the case as the basic definition is clearly about equal rights only). Basis of this talk, I see no point of targeting the speaker as anti-women. To me, she comes across as objectively representing facts of things not widely discussed. I should forward the talk to amateur and unaware feminists as this will widen the space to engage with the concept of equality. But some of the comments are quite painful to see. After going through the talk one says, 'finally - someone is talking sense' that also indicates the ignorance. I don't think she is preaching that all the women rights conversation are meaningless or pointless. She is fighting against false cases. She is preaching EQUALITY and not demanding that all what happens in feminsm are unjust.",

One of many examples. In fact, it would be very hard for you to find a single example where feminists have pushed for equal responsibilities.\n\nI trust this helped!",

You've assumed that because women were not legislatively, socially and culturally acknowledged for their involvement in all \"masculine ventures\" (war, business, politics, education) that they were not involved, affected or took responsibility. Just to show you how much women are deemed and have been deemed responsible citizens just flick through a \"news\"paper or ease drop on the countless conversations about how a child failing school, becoming a truant, a home breaking down, the over sexualization of society, etc. are all down to... women! That's pretty impressive for beings that have never held any responsibility. \n\nSurely arguing that all women take no responsibility is as hateful and erroneous as stating all men are spoilt child-like beings whom are too egotistical and aggressive? All humans need to take responsibility, period.",

Imagine a situation that one fine day every men on earth decide to go against women & decide to cease rights from every women , human <b> race </b>will cease to exist..... Women today forgets that it was Raja Ram Mohan Roy who abolished Sati Pratha..... It was Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar who fought for social justice for women......  Today if there is protest for acting against violence towards women you will find surprisingly more than 50% of the population is men...... I would really like to see a day when there will be a procession in road where there will be all women who are protesting against injustice towards men by women...... Relation between men & women should be like you fight for us & we fight for you....... you protect us & we protect you.....",

                    "commentText": "A few points I would answer  \n\n1) \"All those rules were made by a man, so no big deal that they ended it\" - who ended it ? you would say women. I say both men & women together ended it . For God's sake there are men in remotest part of the country who bled , lost life for women empowerment.\n\n2)  \"If you do a good deed and think someone should be obliged from it\" - These are the men who never wanted any one to be obliged from their deed, they don't need favors. But as a social, sensitive person shouldn't we learn from them ? Shouldn't we implement their thoughts? Or just call them show offs ??\n\n3)  \"but look at you people, feminism, thing you call a \"TREND\" just started some time ago and your fragile male egos couldn't take it, because all the attention was been given to us\" - Ofcourse  its a \"TREND', when a movement is not guided by conscience it becomes a popular TREND. All the attention given to you ? Who is giving all the attention? Only Women ? Are you saying this movement is happening without the support and ATTENTION of good men, like your father or your brothers ? \n\n4) \"And you're very wrong if you think that every man on the planet went against women\" - I am sorry I may have exaggerated this but that's a truth we men are brutal & history has proved that we are mass murderers. I am sorry I don't know why God has made us like this.\n\n5) \" and suddenly all those things you took for granted didn't come your way as usual and you're upset, and you ask us to be fine by the torture and tradition <b> patriarchy </b>set for us \" - Who says that things didn't come in our way ? we are not doing this for empower high society trendy women who thinks male bashing is women empowerment , we are doing it for the maid servants, economically poor strong women & we are achieving it whether you like it or not. ARE YOU MAD  to think that I am ok with women torture &<b>  patriarchy</b>? \n\nWhat I am asking is please take CARE of men who are ready to take bullets for you. We have taken bullets for you trust me, We will take care of men who would throw bullets towards you.",

Where did I say women ended it. I don't know from where you're getting it.\nAnd again I never said that I don't care what those men did for women to get human rights, all I said that it's not a obligation, it's a duty, of every human towards every human.\nAnd NO. Feminist is not a trend. I don't understand wanting to attain human rights for everyone, since when it was okay to think of it as a trend. Just becasue women had issues about being treated like animals or property, so suddenly it's a womens movement and it's a trend. Asking for human rights for anyone is a right, and it will never be a TREND. It's a movement.\nAnd again. I don't know how you got the feeling that I said that EVERY man went against women, I said a lot of them, please go and check my text.\nAnd no, God din't make you like this. You can't blame everything on GOD okay. GOD gave you a brain too, din't he, use it and think hard before you do anything, maybe then crimes like these won't happen.\nAnd first of all, get it straight kid, feminism = human rights for everyone. Okay.\nAnd second of all, no feminists think women empowerment is male bashing. We din't bash male aa a <b> gender,</b> but yea we bash. Bash that proportion of<b>  gender</b> who treats us this way. We bash that proportion of ou<b> r gende</b>r who treats us this way. It's a movement of intolerance of inhuman behavior imposed by anyone. So there.\nAnd again, no need to take bullets for people unless you're in the army, just try understanding people around without being prejudiced and maybe stop judging people over petty and insignificant things, and stop controlling people, I think world would be a paradise just with that.",

The part of the movement which is NOT GUIDED by CONSCIENCE is a TREND & dangerous.\n\n\"And again, no need to take bullets for people unless you're in the army\" - it has already been taken. If you don't believe, search for Barun Biswas of Sutia, West Bengal. It is just one of the many examples. He was not an army man. He was small poor school master. So, does that mean his contribution is insignificant? No one said that there is obligation to follow this person. Where does he stand in the eyes of the feminist? Though people like him never cared for that. As humanist don't we owe him at least Thank You ? Or is it too egoistic for no-feminist to admit & be thankful to this person.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barun_Biswas",

However, with the exception perhaps of a few movements, none of which are applicable in India, it has almost unanimously given women privileges, without any responsibility or consequences for misuse. It does not work in practice. You have a situation where men in this country can get fired for offending women with comments. They're just words, mere words. In actual fact all that feminism has taught me is that women are too weak for words, which I know is not true. Perhaps a more appropriate statement would be that feminists are too weak for words, since all women are not feminists, for obvious reasons.",

Feminism is not a people raising their voices for women rights, but consists of  people raising their voices for <b> gender </b>equality. There is a prominent difference between the two. EQUALITY is what our focus is. Both men and women are sufferers of this inequality. Their preferences and their individuality are judged just on the basis of their<b>  gender</b>. We want to eradicate this. There are people who have misunderstood the meaning of feminism for women rights and that is wrong. we are here for equality and are against the establishment of supremacy of an<b> y gende</b>r over another, and I want you to understand that",

It's not that they're too weak for words, it's like you said before, that women were given access to privileges (in law) without responsibility or consequences for misuses. I think that imbalance instantiated into law had the unintended effects of corrupting the individual women with something that appeared to them like an instant gratification or easy fix or convenience without their future repercussions having to fully be considered, which grants you social power and by being unchecked, well \"absolute power corrupts absolutely\". Or at the least, it's an unbalanced, maybe discriminatory law because it can't be applied to any individual equally in the society. That, like being rich, allows you to feel somehow more socially \"backed\", and so you more neurotically and nominatively appease your base desires on your whim, rather than living in the rational world reconciling with and sublimating the collective and individual desires.",

Intersex people already exist and they exist because genetic mutations exist.  The same is true for any hyp<b> othetic</b>al \"gender-related\" alleles.  Mutations could be - and probably are - extremely rare (i.e. intersex births are somewhere between around 0.018% and 1.7% of live births) but they would almost certainly exist.  Even a comparable rate of just 0.018% would mean that there are some 134 million atypically gendered people out in the world and some 5.7 million in the United States alone.  Personally, that's not enough to make me go around calling people \"ze\" instead of \"he\" or \"she\" but that's still a hell of a lot of people.\n\nIf you are a<b> rguing </b>that gender is intrinsic to the human soul or something, I have no argument because you would no longer be talking about what you can prove.\n\nThat said, we agree (<b> agai</b>n) that \"sex\" is a part o<b> f a per</b>son's \"gender\".

                    "commentText": "Mentalidade Logica & Chani J.R.\n\nMy earlier statement regarding intersex people should have largely explained several of these points already.  First, just as genetic and environmental factors create a whole host of intersex conditions, the same \"complex interplay\" could result in a wide variety of \"intergender\" conditions between or even outside male and female.  Asking how many genders there are is like asking exactly where the color \"<b> red<b> \"</b</b>> stops and the color \"blue\" begins in the following image:\n\n [LINK] \n\nThis is what people say when they hypothesize about a<b>  \"gende</b>r spectrum\".  I prefer to think of it a<b> s \"gend</b>er gradient\".\n\nAlso, many things ab<b> out gen</b>der are cultural.  There is no genetic imperative to wear pink dresses, watch romantic comedies, be a bad driver and/or mechanic, or have an endless craving to go shopping.  For example bein<b> g a<b>  \"drag q</b</b>>ueen\" and loving the movie \"The Notebook\" are considered unusual male behaviour except when you are a male Scottish film critic who wears kilts.  The history of fashion, for example the wearing of high heels or the fedora hat also shows that there's plenty of evidence that clothing choice is especially culture-driven a<b> nd not </b>gender-driven.\n\nI totally agree that many asp<b> ects of</b> gender could be (and probably are) determined at birth and continue to develop well into adulthood just as (or perhaps \"because\") our brains do.  Trying to change it could very well be just as impossible as turning testes into working ovaries and would probably be just as pointless as treating dextrocardia in cases where it doesn't impair bodily function. (we did find the genes for the ovaries thing in mice though.)  \n\nAnd in your own example about intersex boys - less than half continued identifying as female but this proves the absolute statem<b> ent tha</b>t gender \"cannot be changed\" incorrect otherwise all of the subjects would have transitioned <b> male.  </b>If gender were truly were intrinsic and unchanging then no amount of family or cultural pressure would convince any of them to \"stay\" female.  Once again, still I agree that \"c<b> orrecti</b>ng\" gender identity would be extremely difficult, mostly unsuccessful, probably unnecessary and of dubious help t<b> o a chi</b>ld's mental health compared to simply letting the child live<b>  as wha</b>tever gender they want to live as.",

The world doesn't come down into perfect little boxes for you to count and fill with stuff.\n\nYou might as well be asking \"How many numbers are there?\"  Not only are there an infinite number of numbers but each number is infinitely divisible - meaning there's an infinite number of numbers between each of the infinite number of numbers.\n\nFor what its worth, I believe the vast majority of the 7.5 billion human beings alive today are considered either \"male\" or \"female\" gendered but there are hundreds of millions of exceptions just like there are hundreds of millions of people who don't technically classify as having either the male or female <b> sex </b>because of developmental disorders.\n\nIn India and Samoa there are already accepted social groups considered \"third<b>  gender</b>\" and for different reasons.

                    "commentText": "The definition of <b> gender </b>can be imprecise. Trying to categorise species can be imprecise too - but species traits or characteristics are innate. Though the \"culture\" of classifying species may change over time, the species traits themselves don't change over that same time. (no, I'm not a creationist).\n\nWe have been placing the definition and cultural expression \"cart\" of<b>  gender</b> before the \"horse\" o<b> f gende</b>r itself. To further confound this, while it is true that cultur<b> al gend</b>er expression differs among cultures and time periods, there are cert<b> ain gen</b>der traits that do not differ. These traits relate to risk aversion, types of play, communication style, etc.\n\nThese are the traits we can and do easily identify in children. This is how we know when transgendered people aren't simply cross-dressing and choosing to express a certain cultural definitio<b> n of ge</b>nder.\n\nAs for the impasse in the youtube comments section. I don't usually bother, but then again I don't usually get into arguments in comments sections. You're aware that our argument centers on the definiti<b> on of g</b>ender but you then assume (wildly - amusingly, even) that this is because I'm unaware of the definition you're using. I've pointed out multiple times that I'm talking about the same definition, but you run off in a mad huff as if you were playing a game of one-up with a Creationist. You're focusing on the 'social construct' aspects of the definition that relates to how we classify expressi<b> ons of </b>gender culturally. I am parsing that sentence and recognisi<b> ng that</b> gender is something we can express. \n\nTo shorten that and tidy it up s<b> omewhat</b>; Gender describes the characteristics or traits that a society or culture delineates as masculine or feminine. Ie. the society or culture doesn't c<b> reate t</b>he gender characteristics or traits. It classifies them. When speaking of broad behavioural characteristics, these characteristics themselves are innate and present from birth. \n\nSome prefer to limit their unders<b> tanding</b> of gender to the discussion o<b> f \"enfo</b>rced gender roles\". I do not, and nor does much of science. I am aware that there are some researchers seeking to show that parents' socialisation of babies is entirely respons<b> ible fo</b>r the gender differences we perceive as inborn, but those researchers have a mountain of evidence showing otherwise to overcome. \n\nThe only question that remains for me is; do we define<b>  those </b>inborn gender differences as biologi<b> cal </b>- and thus sex differences? And, if we do, what do we then do with those infants whose chromosomal and genital type is male, but whose other traits are characteristic of those with female chromosomes and genitalia? We (as a culture or society) cou<b> ld inve</b>nt a new gender classification akin to \"man <b> with s</b>pirit of a woman\", but I'd prefer to just <b> accept </b>that their gender is f<b> emal</b>e though their sex is male. Certainly, if we were to invent a new classification, that classification would be a social construct. \n\nHopefully this has helped to illuminate the difference between social constructions and innate characteristics that I was trying to discuss. Not every social media comments exchange has to be an argument.",

I'm using the definitions I can find in the literature.  You seem to be making up your own.  It's like trying to ague with a tea-partier about the definition of \"freedom\".\n\n\"Though the \"culture\" of classifying species may change over time, the species traits themselves don't change over that same time\"\n\nThough there are several problems with that statement there are two things I'd like to point out:\n\n1) Biological traits do change over time due to natural selection.\n\n2) During the court of Louis XIV high heels were a prominent male status symbol, now they are exclusively a female fashion item\n [LINK] \n\nAs culture changes, our ideas surroundin<b> g gende</b>r change.  You and Mentalidade seem to be arguing this is wrong when it is an obvious fact.  Arguing that the traits which underlay our classification of anything are innate and unalterable seems ludicrous.  For example, take your argument that how risk averse a person is is related to the<b> ir gend</b>er.  Can you please show me a paper comparing how risk-averse cisgender women are<b>  to transgen</b>der women rather than cisgender men?  Otherwise, despite being calle<b> d a \"ge</b>nder\" difference, this is really a comparis<b> on of s</b>exual difference.\n\n\n\"The only question that remains for me is; do we define those <b> inborn </b>gender differences as biological - a<b> nd t</b>hus sex differences? And, if we do, what do we then do with those infants whose chromosomal and genital type is male, but whose other traits are characteristic of those with female chromosomes and genitalia?\"\n\nAs far as I'm concerned all \"differences of the b<b> ody\"</b> are sex differences.  Likewise all \"differences of clothing, affect, and atti<b> tude\" a</b>re gender differences.  If we simply stop using the terms interchangeably,  this simplifies the argument enormously.<b>   If</b> one's sex is no longer treated as an absolute requirement for belonging to a<b>  partic</b>ular gender then there is no argument whatsoever.  Those born with or with<b> out aty</b>pical sexual characteristics simply belong<b>  to whi</b>chever gender they feel most comfortable in.  If in time this leads to the creation<b>  of add</b>itional gender identities I see it causing very little harm in pluralistic societies.\n\nBasically, unless Mentalidade gets their way everything will sort itself out if we just stay on the road we're already on.",

Well the reason is because you lack foundation in your arguments, so I will answered for you, based on your choice and mutual agreement.\n\nThe question was how many genders are there, <b> zero,</b> two or seven billion?\n\nThe answer is it dependents on the definition and there are lots of them. However, you and I can agree that it is a term that applies to humans. I don't think you would disagree with that. We all know that there are only two sexes, aka XY & XX, (even true biological hermaphrodites have to be properly diagnosed under surgery as their lives may depend on it).\n\nSo the question then is to determine if<b>  gender</b> relates t<b> o se</b>x. This is where the problem lies, but we can use logical deduction to make a choice.\n\nOption 1) Y<b> es gend</b>er relates<b>  to </b>sex.\nOption 2<b> ) no ge</b>nder does not rela<b> te t</b>o sex.\nOption 3) th<b> e term </b>gender no longer applies to humans -case closed.\n\nIf you choose option 1), <b> that is</b> gender is re<b> late</b>d to sex, then logically there are only two possible outco<b> mes, a </b>XY gender<b>  plus a</b> XX Gender, thus impossible to have any other number. Agende<b> r, CIS,</b> CIS Gender, Bygender, etc, can not be classified as genders because there are more than two. There is no XXYXX or XYXYX or whatever, you see. Only XX or XY - period. G= XY+XX\n\nIf on the other hand you chose option<b>  2), th</b>at <b> is gende</b>r has noth<b> ing </b>to do with sex, then by process of elimin<b> ation</b> there are zero genders as far as XX or XY. Or if you prefer there are 7 billion genders, much like 7B individualists. G=0+7B\n\nSimple as that!",

I just want to know why you'd bother replying to my trolling (American?) Christian male alter-ego. There's <b> nothing </b>constructive going on there. Since we're obviously the same person (lol), talk to me instead. I don't even disagree with you. It's just that we're talking about 2 different things. One thing is the sociology study of how<b>  gender</b> is expressed by adults in a culture. The other is the exploration of wha<b> t gende</b>r is (independent of culture) and where it comes from. It studies neonates, hormones in the womb at different stages of gestation, etc. It differentiat<b> es gend</b>er f<b> rom </b>sex because the two phenomenon have different causes and are not necessarily aligned. \n\nThat said, I kind of agree with \"my other self\" that are 2 genders, but <b> that ge</b>nder doesn't necessarily align<b>  wit</b>h sex. An indivi<b> dual's </b>gender can lie anywhere on a continuum from very male to very female. A<b> nd that</b> gender is present and discernible in neonates, according to robust research. In n<b> eonates</b>, gender is intrinsi<b> c. \n\nTh</b>at gender is independent o<b> f cultu</b>ral gende<b> r norms.</b<b> > An e</b>lderly woman from a tribe that's never had contact with Westerners could correctly<b>  identi</b>fy the gender of a Western child from watching them run around interacting with others, even if th<b> e child</b> had a (gender neutral) nappy on. There's a few children for whom the answer would be \"I don't know\" and that's fine. All people should be treated with dignity and justic<b> e regar</b>dless of gender anyway. The main thin<b> g is</b>, it's not a sex difference, allowing for the children who are born male<b>  to hav</b>e a female gender, and vice versa. \n\nContrary to what's become a cultural norm in Western un<b> iversit</b>y campuses, gender isn't something that is \"figured out\" in college. That's the phenomenon of transtrenders. They're fine too, since they're adults when they dec<b> ide to </b>change their ge<b> nder. People</b> who are transgend<b> er don'</b>t change their<b>  gender</b>. They are that gender as children. The \"trans\" <b> prefix </b>is because their gender <b> does</b>n'<b> t align </b>with their sex. \n\nNothing in this should have caused such distress, nor accusations of trolling or \"non-personhood\". But, for variou<b> s reaso</b>ns,<b>  the su</b>bjects of gender and gender expression have become fraught with conflict and tension. This is silly, and we all suffer as a result.",

It also relates to Freud's Id, \"alter-ego\" and ego, if the same person. (kind of like two birds with one stone type word).\n\nI agree too (if I read you right) that faith is a form of control for the masses, the other one is <b> sex.</b> Hence why man-made religion was invented and why<b>  sex</b> has always been historically so taboo.\n\nI always believe that there are two definitions for religion, one with a big 'R' and a small 'r'. Small 'r' man-made created and supported by 'holy' books and the big 'R' is a personal connection between yourself and a supreme being. However, I do respect all small 'r' because they do serve a valuable purpose for the masses, when not taken to extremes.\n\nAdd the color pink and perfumes for men to Loui's court too.",

Is that a reference to his/her own intolerance for whatever it is they are referring to as \"shit\"? \n\nWhat actually scares me is the tendency for some to dismiss people they disagree with as non-persons. \"Not real\". It's erasure. It's precisely what's been done to transgendered and interesex children in the past, and that doesn't make what's being done to \"cis-heteronormative-scum\" now any better. The idea is to remove <b> gender </b>bigotry. Not simply flip the tables. This behaviour is what spawned this whole conversation. Instead of removing<b>  gender</b> bigotry, legislating for equality of opportunity and justice for people regardless o<b> f gende</b>r, Feminists in India simply came in and legislated special privileges for women. They gave women the tools with which to oppress and extort others, operating under the misguided assumption that<b>  a wom</b>an cannot oppress a man - even though she has institutionalised power over him (and his family) and he has no recourse. \n\nWe are all in a position to be prejudiced. When we take advantage of a power imbalance to act on our prejudice against another person, that is oppression. We shouldn't be giving those we perceive as weak the power of the State to abuse others. The goal should be to prevent the abuse of power.",

It seems that manhood is being attacked worldwide. The abuse women use is intangible, unquantifiable, not visible... so it is often not considered abuse. Men are not perfect, but women are no better than men. No amount of pain is justified in causing it in another human being; if we live this way the pain will never end. My heart goes out to those who are being wrongfully accused. Too many people don't understand that men have hearts, and those hearts run very deep. Thank you for speaking out about this.",

It's clear to me that, even if this is the case, this means that men are far more likely to SUCCEED in killing themselves than women are. But very few seem to realize that.\n\nNow, many will bring up the \"well, they have guns and such\" argument (including my own damn mother, who literally shows no shame when I call her out for being sexist, much to my frustration and disappointment).\nI think it's bullshit. Why? Well, it's indeed true that men tend to use guns more often when committing suicide, but the fact that they have guns is irrelevant, or at best, only weakly related to them committing suicide.\nIf this was true, then why aren't people with knives committing suicide at high rates? Pretty much everyone has knives in their kitchen and uses them daily. (even more often than one would use a gun)\n\nP.S.\nJust had an incident a few weeks ago in my town where a police officer committed suicide. He did it only a few blocks from where I live. It's not clear if he was going through divorce, as no officials have spoken about any of his private life or what might have caused him to kill himself.\nNaturally, I looked him up on google, and wasn't shocked when I came upon articles which celebrated his death. (Because he was a cop.)",

And yes you will have friends who always with you at your good times but ran away at your bad times.\nAnd at last you will find this cruel world that when you have deep pockets everyone is being nice to you and when your pocket is empty then you will see real face.",

Furthermore the Malala petition had the result that children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling and the petition also led to the Pakistan passing the Right to Education Bill 2012, guaranteeing that all children, aged between five and 16, have access to free education. These are just some of the things she has done. From what I know Malala doesn't even call herself a feminist, I've only seen other people call her that.",

                    "commentText": "Yes, I still live in India. Other than dowry, honour killing is a unique issue that India faces. In India arranged marriages are very <b> common </b>as its still to a great extend a conservative society and many people believe that men and women shouldn't choose their partners and that love marriages shouldn't be allowed. In many villages here, it's the parents who choose a husband/wife for their kids. So when children go against this practice, some parents kill their children and justify it by saying that they were spoiling their culture and disrespecting the family that's why they had to kill them. This practice is called honour killing. There were many social evils in India like people of lower castes were considered untouchables and were ill treated, widows were burned alive along with her husband's dead body as it was believe that there is no meaning of a woman's existence after the death of her husband. Her husband was her identity which exists no more. But these issues no longer exist. Very strict laws have been made against such practices. But honour killings continue to happen. By the way, where are you from?",

Honor killing is a crime against humanity not against one <b> sex.</b> And housewives burning is a issue in certain places but the worst thing about it is that the reason of this burnings are mostly due the mother-in-law which is ironically a female. If such crimes are committed by women too and people blame all men! It seems<b>  weird</b>!",

One REAL MAN very close to me was driven to suicide by his monster wife and all of India knows of another whose reputation has been shattered and who has been thrown into jail under what, i believe, are false rape charges under the new laws in India after the Nirbhaya case. BUT these are just a drop in the ocean when compared to the trillions of heinous crimes ranging from gang rape, infant rape, incest, dowry-burning, acid-throwing, etc. which have been happening on a daily basis in India for eons! And those cases against the little children she was tom-toming about? It was a mistake where the police made a comprehensive list of the family members which was then carelessly copied into the rape register. Were those children punished or victimised? No, the whole country laughed at that mistake, which was just that!\n<b> Nobody </b>is condoning false accusers, who have traditionally and historically been men, as a matter of fact, but who now include women too. But to seek to rewind all the hard-won rights of humanist activists over the centuries is an heinous thing to do, and to declare proudly that she is going way off the beaten track, in no way negates the harmfulness of the mission. This lady, who repeatedly says 'woman' with such carelessness and contempt, I'm sure is a nightmare to humanists and that is NOT a compliment. No doubt, she'll be getting kudos from men across the country, but bear in mind, if her wishes come true, there will come a day when she and her female progeny, along with the rest of the female<b>  race</b>, will be made to wear a carpet and stay shut in the kitchen, as opposed to being able to stride a stage in man pants.",

I suppose I will use this as a teaching moment but I know the effort to teach you people is futile. You men really think you have it bad in this world. You think you are underrepresented and abused? LMAO\n\nYour \"men's right's\" group is a reaction to a changing power dynamic. It is changing on a worldwide level and probably personal one for you. That makes you scared You all are in the middle of a divorce you most likely caused but insist on blaming the female. You are so beaten down and angry you can't even admit what is happening. It is what it is.\n\nLet me enlighten you:\nThe changing power dynamic is that men are losing power to women and you all know it. My how the tables are turning and not in your benefit for the first time in your lives. That must be a very unsettling feeling for you guys? Obviously it is.\n\nSo you guys can either be MEN and quit whining and crying about it; or do as you are now and start a therapy/support group to mourn your loss of power and control. \n\nGo on and threaten rape and beat your chests...just remember men get raped too and that shit can work both ways son.\n\nThat crying kicking and screaming is not going to change the situation. So either keep circle jerking each other off and passing the tissues or grow up and quit whining. Either way the whole world is playing the smallest violin for  your cause. \n\nYou are welcome.",

Everything from false rape allegations, to unfair child custody, alimony, and family courts.  Men are waking up to these injustices and choosing to opt out of a relationship.  People like you are free to fill the void if you want.  In the mean time we will be building our careers, making money, and keeping it, while you pay out the nose at your divorce settlement.",

They can be anything but <b> an Indi</b>an, NEVER...........Pakistan is all headed for an economic collapse, if tomorrow the liberals of Pakistan decide to join India, We will never allow it. Some Pakistanis have this narrative that India wants to reoccupy Pakistan ,why? Because People like you keep calling them Indians. Don't call them Indians,They are a disease and we much better off without them .In fact I am glad that the British gave these fuckers a different country and we were saved from the horrible disease that is Pakistan.",

If you want men to identify as feminists, then feminism needs to address <b> sexism </b>against men. I have yet to see feminism take steps to advocate for men's rights. When I see that happening that I will be more inclined to identify as feminist. Until then, why should I (a male) join a group that as<b>  ZERO</b> interest in my well-being? Please do not interpret this comment as me asserting that feminists hate men. I am not saying feminists hate men. I am saying feminists have no interest in advocating men's right. Yes, there are certainly feminists that hate men. Hoover, the vast majority of feminists do not hate men. For example, although a feminist may not desire for <b> a woma</b>n to beat a man - feminists have no interest in ending domestic abuse of men. The abuse of men <b> by wom</b>an is of no interest to feminists.",

It's a surprise that they were never given any media attention. The movement is mainly comprised of men who went through traumatic divorces, and who realized that the laws are simply to harsh on them for relationships to even be worth it. Feminism has taught women that it is okay for a <b> woman </b>to destroy a man, while a man must  simply stand there and not retaliate. If a man does dare to reciprocate, he is deemed a<b>  misogynist</b>, and <b> a woma</b>n hater deserving of destruction in every way possible. To put it simply, men are scared of women. It may sound absurd, but reality is reality. You, as<b>  a wom</b>an probably couldn't give a ** about this, but maybe this book b<b> y a wo</b>man will enlighten you.\n \"The Manipulated Man\" by Esther Vilar.",

Sadly men can't speak up about men's issues without being socially shamed and portrayed as <b> woman </b>haters or crybabies. Ironically it takes amazing empathic women like you and Karen Straughan to speak up for men, and we are very greatful for your efforts. I'm so tired of this one sided approach to<b>  gender</b> equality, and the outright hostility towards even listening to men's issues, let alone acknowledging them. Dispite the overwhelming statistics and studies backing them up. It's shameful how especially those who claim to be all about equality do their best to sweep this under the carpet. It isn't <b> a zer</b>o sum game. These issues aren<b> 't gend</b>er issues, they are social and human issues. All that claiming these are gendered issues does is feed hostilities and widen the divide between the genders, for a large part to do with attention and funding. Feminism, in the west, is big money. What else are all those professional victims going to do with their useless women's studies degrees? It's time we make l<b> aws gen</b>der neutral, which is possible for the vast majority of laws.\n\nAgain, thank you, Deepika, for restoring my faith in humanity.",

A lazy<b>  woman</b> who doe<b> s nothin</b>g but allow her husband to pay her bills for 20 years deserv<b> es nothi</b>ng if they divorce. I don't care what she has gotten accustomed to. If she does not provide material value to the marriage, she should take no material value from the spouse who provided 100% of the finances.  She kept house and raised some kids? So what.  I'd love to stay home, operate a few appliances, drop the kids off at soccer and  cook a few meals rather than work out in the snow and rain here in Alaska. Being a Western housewife/mom is a it's own reward.   It should not entitle the beneficiary of that largess to a bloated compensation package when she decided to cash in. (75% of divorces are filed for by women. The single biggest reason they give for wanting a divorce?  Does he beat you? No.  Did he cheat on you? No. Is he mean to you? No, I'm just not happy.)  Women have every incentive to divorce and no reason not to.  Is it a wonder why they do it in such huge numbers?",

Therefore, at its core and in context of Cold War, \"third world\" term refers to the poor countries that served interests of two duelling superpowers of West.

The idea that she automatically gets a piece of a man's wealth simply because she chose to have a child is ridiculous.  The man, obviously, should be partially responsible for that child's care, and that responsibility can be met financially and through the work done raising that child by the man.\n\nAs far as the idea that th<b> e woma</b>n \"raised\" the kids and deserves an income level of that of a professional nanny, let's debunk that now.  Last I checked, most women aren't professional nannies, so they do not deserve the level of income that a professional nanny makes.  Even ignoring the fact that the vast majority of women do not have the skills/certifications of a professional nanny, we find serious problems.  Primary among these problems is that the worth of t<b> he wom</b>an's raising is only a differential between the raising the man and <b> the wo</b>man performs.  For instance, if the man comes home and does a total of 25 percent of the raising of the child,<b>  the w</b>oman does not get to bill him for 75 percent of the raising of the child.  It's their shared child.  What she is \"worth\" is the amount of extra work she does over the man in raising the kid.  Her net, in this case, is 50%.  When you consider the $652 average weekly salary of live-in nannies, she's making about 325 a week at that 50% differential.  That's under 17K a year, yet we see women demanding millions/billions for child care.  Granted, some of these may be cases where the man did very little parenting, an<b> d the </b>woman deserved more \"pay\" per week, but even in these cases, it is insane f<b> or the</b> woman to be demanding millions/billions of dollars in what is, at maximum, hundreds of thousands of \"backpay\".",

Although, a lot of it is due to your complete inability to offer any actual unbiased facts.\n\nSo, ignoring all the evolutionary reasons men took leadership power during our time on Earth, are you saying that, because women were treated poorly throughout history (to our modern ideals, which didn't exist at the time), that it's okay for it to happen to men?  Do you realize this makes you a hypocrite?  The definition of 'feminism' is EQUALITY of the sexes.  As of now, we don't have equality  In this example, special laws are in place for women.  Women are more likely to be hired in jobs, simply for being women.  Women get lighter sentences than men for the same crime.  Women can vote without the need to sign up for the draft.  The list goes on.\n\nName one area in society where men are ACTUALLY more privileged than women?  And don't use the imaginary pay-gap.  It's been proven to be an earnings-gap, due mainly to sociological differences between the sexes, and isn't a valid argument.",

I think many aspects of feminism is ridiculous but men's rights movement ironically emulates the same stupidity that they accuse feminists of.

Again don't call me a feminist because I'm not. I'm an idealist who thinks society not giving a fuck about men will drive a natural selection for better educated, emotionally intelligent and kinder men to be successful with women. This essentially will lead to greater happiness between the sexes in the future. As long as masculinity is replaced by a more emotional intelligent model, <b> gender </b>relations will thrive. But only as long as society don't give a fuck about mra trolls, unintelligent men, ugly men and the type of men who probably mirrors those that have oppressed women in history.",

And, unlike women, men actually have violence hardwired into us from natural selection, so when we push back against things like this, it tends to be in violent ways.  Not saying it's right by today's standards, but human nature doesn't really care about that.  As for the sentencing gap being false, please tell me where you found this info.  If it's actually factual, and not cherry picked like most studies in this area, then I will fully concede that point.  The others however are very clear no matter how you look at it.  Hell, I literally just finished talking to one of my junior personnel who's going through a divorce to a <b> woman </b>who cheated on him.  He has email/text evidence of her harassing him, as well as admitting to avoiding the court summons after he requested the divorce.  She has demanded money the entire time (which he has payed), yet she still holds all the cards in court in this matter.  You're saying this is fair and should be tolerated?\n\nBravo if you say you're not a feminist,  but unfortunately you do share the extremist views of a feminist.  You also seem to hold to the believe that we should men should atone for what was done in the past (again, during times of completely different social structure).  The problem is that you can't punish people for their past beliefs, if those beliefs were the social norm of the time.  Someday, we'll all be looked at as bigots and backwards about something we don't even think about now.",

Not all people are so well tuned to understand the implications of the law to the full- but there is definitely someone who does instigate the \"Make hay while the sun shines\" attitude towards acceptance to sign the papers. In my case it turned out to be two layers who were playing a game together to earn a living on the carcasses of the marriage. \"Ask for all you want, he will pay up...\"; \"You have to give in on these demands they make or face criminal charges against the whole family...\". What a sham!  \n\nWhile sacrifices and compromises are done by each party to a fair level, the use of 498A is like a sword hanging on our necks at all times. \"Do this or else I shall report\" is a threat I faced almost everyday of my life even after concealment of facts was driving my life on a destruction path. In the end, I felt no amount of money is more to buy my family <b> mental </b>peace; but the ugly face of law and its practitioners has made me skeptic to see relationship in the same pious and  joyful manner I had 5 years ago.",

So plz care, understand, love,and women plz be nice to ur husbands/bf, if u get divorced with him don't accuse them of rape violence or anything! JUST MOVE ON GO FIND SOMEONE ELSE!!!!!! when she showed that video it made me think of my bf and it should make u think of hr husband/bf!!! Cuz deep down inside u still have feelings for him u still love him u still care about him! Just don't do anything mean!",

            "commentText": "1. From an early <b> age </b>the opposite<b>  sex</b> will be instructed never to hit me but I may not be given the same instructions. However, should I strike males I can expect not to be hit back and any social penalties that occur from my actions will actually fall on the male.\n2. If I'm not smart, but pretty, I can marry and achieve the social and financial level of my husband without ever working.\n3. I can produce offspring. A status which grants me an 'essential' status in our species that men can never have and which can never be taken away from me even i<b> n ol</b<b> >d a</b>ge.\n4. Regardless of my mate value society has organized fertility clinics and social welfare programs that will allow me to have children and provide for them should I choose to reproduce without a mate or marriage.\n5. I not only have the more valuable and sought af<b> ter sex</b>ual identity, but I also have complete control over my reproductive choice and in many ways over the reproductive choice of the oppo<b> site</b> sex.\n6. At any time I can abandon my parental responsibilities with little or no social stigma and hand the child over to the state or abort the pregnancy. A male could never relieve himself of this burden unless I allow him to.\n7. I am granted all the rights of a democracy without any of the burdens of military service.\n<b> 8. A</b>t age 18 I lose the protective status of the child but retain the protective status of the female. B<b> oys </b>at age 18 lose the protected status of the child and become targets if they fail to gain status after that point.\n9. When I marry a man with status I can take his name and become whoever he has spent years becoming. I need not do anything special to be worthy of receiving the reputation he has built. However, if I wish to keep my own name I can do so. Should my husband feel the sting of this insult I can simply call him a sexist for it.\n10. People will help me more when I'm in need and I will receive no social penalty or stigma for it.\n11. When I'm on a date things will be paid for me.\n12. When I search for employment I can choose jobs which I think are fulfilling without concern of whether they provide a 'family' wage.\n13. I can discriminate against the o<b> ppos</b>ite sex ruthlessly without social penalty.\n14. If I marry and quit my job and enjoy a leisurely life with light housework and then later divorce I will be given half of the marital assets.\n15. If I commit a crime and am convicted I will get a sentencing 'discount' becau<b> se of m</b>y gender. If I am very pretty it will increase my discount.\n16. If I am a partner in crime with a man I will likely be charged with lesser crimes even though I committed the same crimes even if I was the ringleader.\n17. I have the option to be outraged if my husband asks me if my behavior is due to PMS and later on use PMS as a successful legal defense for murdering that same husban<b> d.\n1</b>8. At age 18 I will not be forced to register for Selective Service and will not be penalized for failing to do so.\n19. At a time of war I will never be drafted and ripped from my employment, home, and family and forced to become a military slave.\n20. My feelings are more important than men's lives. Every precaution will be made to protect me from harassment at work. However, males will make up nearly %100 of workplace fataliti<b> es.\n21.</b> My gender controls 80% of domestic spending. We get to spend our money if we have any and we get to spend men's money.\n22. The majority of luxury apparel is designed, marketed to, and consumed by women.\n23. Seven times as much jewelry will be purchased by or for me than by or for men.\n24. I have a department of women's health whereas men have no such departm<b> ent.\n25</b>. My gender enjoys more government spending on health than male<b> s do.\n2</b>6. My gender consumes the lioness' share of entitlement programs while men contribute the lion's share of taxes.\n27. If I rape or molest a child I can expect lighter treatment in court and afterwards receive less social stigma. What's more, should I become pregnant, I can sue my victim for child support when he finally turns 18.\n28. When I divorce my husband I will be guaranteed custody of my children unless I am deemed to be unfit. Even if my husband is 'Parent of the Year' 10 years running it is unlikely he will get custody over me even if I am a mediocre parent.\n29. When I divorce I can use false accusations of domes<b> tic vio</b>lence, sexual molestation of the children or abuse of the children to gain advantage during court proceedings. If I am found out to be a liar I can expect to get away with it.\n30. If a man calls me a slut it will probably hurt his reputation more than it hurts mine, but at any rate the damage will be small and localized. However, if I call him a child molester or claim that he raped me I can destroy him completely and the damage may be nationwide.\n31. If I fail at my career I can blame the male dominated society.\n32. I may have the luxury of staying home and being a housewife but if my sister's husband does the same thing I'm likely to call him a deadbeat loser and tell her to leave him.\n33. If I 'choose' to join the military; the best military occupations providing the most lucrative civilian training will be reserved for me. I will be kept away from the fighting as much as possible to the point that I will be thirty times less likely to be killed in a war zone than my male counterparts. I will be given equal pay for less risk. I will never have to consider the fact that by joining the military and getting a plumb assignment I automatically forced a male out of that position and into a combat role that may cost him his life.\n34. If a male soldier injures himself before a deployment he can be arrested and court marshaled for it. If I deliberately get pregnant before a deployment or even during a deployment I will be reassigned and or taken out of a war zone and I will receive no penalty <b> for it.</b>\n35. My gender watches more television in every hour of every day than any other group. This along with the fact that women control %80 of domestic spending means that most television shows and advertisement are designed to appeal to me.\n36. I can wear masculine clothing if it pleases me however men cannot wear feminine clothing without social penalty.\n37. Not only is there a wealth of clothing choices designed for me but it is likely that I will be able to afford or have them provided for me.\n38. I can claim that a wage gap exists and that it <b> is the </b>fault of sexism while simultaneously seeking employment without considering income as a priority. I will probably choose my job based on satisfaction, flexibility of hours, and working conditions and then expect to make as much as the males working nights, out in the rain and cold or working overtime.\n39. I can be bigoted or sexist against males without social penalty.\n40. If I make a false claim of rape against a male in an act of revenge or in order to cover up my own scandalous behavior I may well succeed at both and he may spend years in prison. If I am found out it is unlikely I will be charged, convicted, or serve any time at all.\n41. If I abuse my husband and physically assault him and the police arrive it is almost guaranteed he will go to jail.\n42. If I am in an abusive relationship there are a multitude of social organizations to help me get away from him. There are few for men in the same position even though women initiate the majority of DV and even though men are hospitalized %30 of the time.\n43. In the event of a natural disaster or other emergency that requires evacuation I can expect to be evacuated before males. Th<b> is inclu</b>des male doctors, humanitarians, politicians, captains of industry, billionaires, and religious leaders. I will receive no social penalty if all of those people died because I was evacuated first. However, should they manage to get evacuated before women and those women died they will all suffer a social penalty.\n44. If someone is attacking a person on the street I have no obligation to assist them and I will receive no socia<b> l penalt</b>y if I do nothing.\n45. If someone is harming my children and I run away and ask someone else to help I will receive no social penalty for my cowardice.\n46. I'm immune to cognitive dissonance.\n47. I may denounce the concept of a dowry, however, I still expect a man to give me an engagement ring when he asks me to marry him.\n48. I expect a man to ask me to marry me and suffer the potential risk of rejection.\n49. If I lie it's because I'm a victim of a male dominated society forced into difficult circumstances and not because I'm a bad person.\n50. If my boyfriend sabotages a condom he can pay me child support for the next 20 years. If I secretly don't take my birth control my boyfriend can pay me child support for the next 20 years.\n51. If I'm uncomfortable exercising around men I can demand a female only gym be made for women. If any male only gyms exist I can demand membership under threat of lawsuit.\n52. If my female only gym at the university decides to close early for safety re<b> asons I</b> can scream sexism and force them to keep it open as long as the main gym.\n53. If I succeed at keeping the female gym open and I leave late at night and I don't feel safe I can demand that the university spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for more lighting and police presence.\n54. If after getting new lighting and police protection I decide I don't want to go to the gym anymore well that's just my prerogative.\n55. I'm likely t<b> o beli</b>eve that if a woman is intoxicated she is not capable of g<b> ivin</b>g consent and if sex occurs it is rape. However, if her male partner is also intoxicated he is capable of consenting.\n56. If a man is promoted over me at work I ha<b> ve a ri</b>ght to suspect sexism even though I also believe that under adverse circumstances men are more capable than women of making good decisions. (see #55)\n57. I can cry and get my husband to do something for me that he might not have done otherwise.\n58. I expect people (especially men) to be sensitive to my feelings.\n59. I can deny a man's feelings or disregard them or ridicule him for having them without social penalty.\n60. If I lose <b> my job </b>it's because of sexism or the economy. If a man loses his job it's because he's a loser.\n61. If I go to a club or bar with my girlfriends and I look my sexy best I have a right to be perturbed when men approach me and hit on me in this public place.\n62. Even though men die more from prostate cancer than women die from breast cancer I can expect that twice as much funding is given for breast cancer. The same will apply to any female specific disease or malady.\n63. If for some reason I do not get custody of my children I will be expected to pay less child support than another man in my exact same position.\n64. If I kidnap my children and I am eventually caught I can successfully defend myself by claiming I was protecting them from my husband\u2013even if my children were given to him to prote<b> ct them</b> from me.\n65. My gender makes up %53 of the voting population yet when I see more men in political<b>  office</b> I will call that sexism.\n66. If I am married with children and I want to stay home with the kids I'm likely to blame my husband for not making enough to allow me to do that.\n67. I think it is my right to work and I am unconcerned if the influx of women into the workforce has reduced overall wages to the point that it's hard to support a family on just one income, or affirmative action has kept men from being promoted even though they deserved it.\n68. I can get student financial aid without signing up for Selective Service (the Draft).\n69. I can get employment with a federal agency without signing up for Selective Serv<b> ice.\n70</b>. Restrooms for my gender will be cleaner and are more likely to have flowers or other decorations.\n71. If I'm caring fo<b> r a chi</b>ld restrooms for my gender will more likely have a changing table for my convenience.\n72. People I've never met before are more likely to open doors for me.\n73. People I've never met before are more likely to talk to me in public.\n74. If I go to a bar I can expect t<b> hat </b>members of the opposite sex will purchase drinks for me.\n75. Anytime I find an organization just <b> for men</b> I can denounce it as sexism.\n76. I believe that women should have organizations just for women.\n77. If I meet a man that I like and I give him my phone number and he doesn't call I have a right to think of him as an asshole.\n78. If I meet a man that I like and I give him my phone number and he calls me I have a right to blow him off or act like I don't know him.\n79. I believe I have a right to live in an orderly and safe society but I feel no obligation to risk my safety to secure or maintain that society.\n80. I like it when bars and clubs have drinks specials just for women.\n81. I think that organizations that offer any discounts or privileges ju<b> st for </b>men is a clear sign of sexism.\n82. If I'm white I will live 6 years longer than white <b> males </b>and 14 years longer than black males.\n83. If I'm encouraged to get medical care it's because I owe it to myself.\n84. When my husband is encouraged to get medical help it's because he owes to to me and the kids.\n85. If somethin<b> g bad </b>happens to me or just one woman I believe it is an offense against all women.\n86. I believe that if something bad happens to a man it's because he's a loser.\n87. I think tha<b> t alim</b>ony is fair when paid to a <b> woman </b>but not fair when paid by a woman.\n88. I'm more likely to believe that women who commit crimes are sick and need treatment or understanding whereas men who commit crimes are evil and should be locked up forever<b> .\n89</b>. I can criticize the opposite sex without social penalty, but woe be to the man who attempts to criticize me or other women.\n90. I can <b> thro</b>w a fit and act like a two year old to get what I want without damaging my mate value.\n91. I have the luxury of not being the filter for natural selection.\n92. I can sleep with my boss if I w<b> ant and</b> afterwards I can sue him for sexual harassment.\n93. I can wear seductive clothing and perfume to attract a man<b>  at wor</b>k but no one will accuse me of sexual harassment.\n94. If I hear a story <b> about Da</b>rfur and how men who leave the refugee camps to gather wood are hacked to death to prevent their wives from being raped I am likely to think that is proper but not likely to send money.\n95. If I hear a story abo<b> ut Darfu</b>r and how women are leaving the refugee camps to gather wood are being raped I'm likely to be outraged. I'm also likely to wonder why these women's husbands aren't protecting them.\n96. If I ever heard these stories about Darfur it is my privilege not to care or even consider that the reason the second story exists is because all the men in the first have already been killed.\n97. It is my right to maintain the belief that men oppress women despite all of the evidence to the contrary.",

Then you deserve if you are a man what's coming to you, don't condescend on women like that. They are smart and powerful enough organize and establish laws and then you think they are incompentent?

If my demand is not met, I can accuse the company of discrimination.\n\n3) Even though I'm more likely to abuse children, I am perceived as sweet & innocent.\n\n4) If I start a fight with a man, I can be guaranteed others will come to my defense - even if he isn't defending himself.\n\n5) I can go to a bar and drink for free.\n\n6) I almost never have to worry about being sexually harassed by my boss as I can take him to the cleaners if he even tries it.\n\n7) My ability to do a certain job will never come into question because of my<b>  gender</b>.\n\n8 ) I can fall on m<b> y gende</b>r as a sympathy vote if I run for politics.\n\n9) I can marry someone based on thier financial or social status like it will actually empower me more.\n\n10) I can sexually assault men and remain legally immune.\n\n11) I can go out in public wearing almost anything without being harrassed or judged as I have a lot more options in clothing, whereas men are generally restricted in their 'acceptable' dress codes.\n\n12) If I so happen to meet someone at a party, and decide to ha<b> ve s</b>ex, I would be viewed as being 'empowered' and television even promotes this with programmes li<b> ke '</b>sex in the city'.\n\n13) I can sexually mutilate my male children and deprive them of a few thousand nerves which assist greatly in enhan<b> cing se</b>xual pleasure.\n\n14) My handbag is my world and get to have groups follow me for a simple pee.\n\n15) I don't have to worry about the father's opinion if I get pregnant, it's all about me!\n\n16) I can bash men and no one bats an eye-lid, if a man bashes us women - we call <b> him a misog</b>ynist and people will shun him.\n\n17) I can date more than one man at the same time, and society would think I'm empowered.\n\n18) I can put on the television and be safe in the knowledge that women are portrayed positively while men are portayed as idiots or abusers.\n\n19) I am practically imune from legal repercussions for my actions as I have feminist groups coming to my saviour - even killing my children or husband.\n\n20) I reproduce - that must be pretty awesome for guys to witness.\n\n21) I can fake an orgasm... something almost impossible for a guy to do.\n\n22) No pharmacist can claim the right to deny me any medicines I ask for at a drug store as I can claim discrimination. Of course, if I'm underage that's different - duh.\n\n23) Even when I am acting wit<b> hin my </b>gender role, I am GAINING from it, rather than being oppressed as I can CHOOSE to stay at home and enjoy watching the children grow up while my husband (assuming I bother to keep him around) works his ass off to keep a roof over our head.\n\n24) If I go to church, I can attend knowing the folks are taught immeasurable levels of respect for me and it is meant to be mutual respect.\n\n25) I don't have to live up to expectations<b>  of h</b>ow thin I am supposed to be - feminism freed me from such pettiness.\n\n26) I get to use PMS as an excuse for murdering my children or husband.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nFeminism has given women privileges without responsibility, and men are left with no choice but to pick up the slack.",

                    "commentText": "I doubt this will get through to someone as evidently vacuous as you, but here goes, \"<b> hun\"</b> (and you will find that if one of us has the right to be condescending in our exchange, it certainly isn't you): Feminism is a tribalist ideology, and thus inherently at odds with egalitarianism, as all tribal perspectives are. It seeks to reinforce a social system of female protection and related hypersensitivity to female concerns, real or imagined, while drawing attention away from, minimalizing, or denying the issues regarding the poor treatment and marginalization of the majority of males. Furthermore, it takes human matters that should be approached in terms of general humanism and redefines them in accordance with the assumption that the needs of females are paramount, that a wrong inflicted on a<b>  woman</b> is a greater outrage than anything inflicted on a man, and that attention should focus on the impact on females above all over concerns. In general conclusion, the focus is selective, the emphasis warped. Attempts by moderates and well-meaning types to \"reclaim\" a good name for feminism are both futile and ethically suspect. The central ideology of feminism is the supposed need to focus on female provision, a long-standing bias and non-egalitarian impulse natural to tribal humans but justified as supposed equality by the feminist worldview. Because egalitarian principles are in vogue, the fa\u00e7ade of egalitarianism must be worn even though what feels right - the impulses, priorities and biases of the tribalist - is at odds with those supposed principles. The answer is ideology that creates justification; i.e. females are an oppressed class and males a privileged one, thus egalitarianism means overwhelming female focus and aid.The core concept in feminist discourse is<b>  \"Patriarch</b>y\" or worse \"T<b> he Patriarc</b>hy\", a term that feminists misuse in a sense that <b> has noth</b>ing to do with the word's actual meaning. Femin<b> ist \"patria</b>rchy\" is code for\n\"the supposed (but non-existent) privileged ruling caste of the supposedly unified male tribe, that benefits males collectively at the expense of females\". Which of cours<b> e has no</b>thing to d<b> o with patr</b>iarchy, the social system wherein familial leadership, authority, responsibility and headship is invested in the paternal figure. Society should rightly be considered in terms of the politicized groups that hold sway over it and its narratives - a) the apex male power structure, political, academic, economical, and b) the collective of females, who are the social and foundational core. The third group is the majority of males, who form a utilitarian framework in service to these first two groups, and do not enter into political consideration.\nThe apex male power elite and the collective of politicized females: society is essentially an uneasy and mutually exploitative, yet mutually symbiotic relationship between these two power blocs. Utilitarian males, the majority of males, only enter into political or social consideration when they are a) useful or b) threatening to the social order as consists of the first two groups. Otherwise they are neglected. Becoming friendly with tribalist structures like feminism will not change this, it will simply make it easier for the abuses to go unchallenged. Feminism reinforces the attitude of neglect, exploitation and demonization of lower-status males and closes the door on positive change and inclusivity. It is an impediment to social progress, a roadblock on the path to societal healing, and it exacerbates the problems it does not directly cause.\nFeminism - as the very name in conjunction with its claim to supposed egalitarianism indicates - is built on an assumption that males everywhere are part of an overarching entrenched system of selfish benefit and privilege<b>  - \"the Pat</b>riarchy\". To the point that movements and efforts to assist men and boys in dire straits are rejected and attacked by feminists and their supporters because they're seen as defending a supposed cabal of privileged power-holders. That is, we can see the justification used to maintain the fa\u00e7ade of egalitarianism over the tribal impulses to privilege the comfort, protection and provision of the female and disenfranchise the competitor males who might topple the apex, established males. This is all preconscious most of the time, but it's defence of this exploitative social structure that motivates the ideologies and behaviours of the majority. This choke-hold causes misery, anger and bitterness in the utilitarian male population in general, causing further division and social breakdown. \nA male who is not a part of one's immediate tribe is a utility at best - and you don't empathise with your labour tools, your swords and shields - or a threat at worst. Feminists hate any structure that is seen as giving males any sort of advantage or power, which is pretty much anything that benefits any individual males in any way, since their worldview depends on the traditional idea of female vulnerability and irresponsibility, and male agency, potency and power, combined with a projected assumption of male in-group bias. Hence their\nunderstanding of a supposed conflict against a potent foe whose grip on the world must be loosened. Some might say that feminism can perhaps be summarized as the sudden (culturally speaking) belief that the male sphere needs to be colonized by the female to address a supposed imbalance, while the advantages and privileges of the female sphere remain untouched, intact, and jealously defended. (Also mostly denied, for reasons both of political convenience and deeper psychology). Once again, it's best to understand feminism as a one-sided tribal power-struggle between the formerly complimentary spheres of male and female. Feminism, then, is a tribal movement in two simultaneous ways: it stems from and reinforces the traditional tribal structure of sheltered female \"objects\" and utilitarian male \"agents\", and it reimagines females themselves as a distinct tribe in conflict with an overbearing aggressor male tribe - in part a simultaneous extrapolation from, and projection onto males of, female <b> in-grou</b>p gender bias. The tribal outgroup is the supposed (in fact non-existent) \"tribe of males\" - co<b> de-named \"P</b>atriarchy\"<b>  (or \"The\" </b>Patriarchy), an inherent misuse of the word. This outgroup is considered to hold morally indefensible power over the in-group. \nFeminism, quite simply, is the pursuit of resources, power, societal status, protection or any other positive for members of the female tribe, through any means - negotiation, attack, manipulation/deception, etc. Exceptions and exemptions, opportunities and license. Sometimes what they want is legitimate and defensible, other times it isn't. But the purpose is always the perceived betterment of the \"female tribe\" at the expense of any other concern (be that concern balance, fairness, social stability, men, children, reason...). At its core (and I would challenge anyone to demonstrate a feminist action or behaviour at odds with this principle, whereas one can easily discredit such erroneous definitions as \"equality\" by showing how many feminist behaviours and initiatives conflict with them), Feminism is the lobbying for that which is currently perceived, in any given context, as bettering or furthering the interests of women who polit<b> icize </b>their woman-ness. That is feminism. Contrary to the feminist narrative of oppression and wrongs committed by other tribes, the women-as-women have always had tremendous power socially and morally, more so than most males can conceive of. It is this to which feminism owes its success. The \"female tribe\" defends what it has, and it reaches always for more. This is its imperative, as with any such group. \nOn top of this, feminism not only continues the age-old tribalist tendency for non-apex males to enter into political consideration only in terms of a) their exploitable utility or b) the threat they pose, but it has united the two, because it exploits them as potential threats - the feminist threat narratives against men, at least the outliers.",

If i say this then they call me narrow minded and they tag me being male <b> chauvinist.</b> Neither i am a anti-feminist. I do support women empowerment but for right cause. Thanks a lot for this video. There is no freedom of speech, expression for men specially when he is talking to a women. We feel that we are inferior. Respect is being demanded now a days just on the basis that they are women rather than being earned. If a women is talking to us in high tone or even physically abuses us, it is expected that we have to behave as a gentle men and reply in lower tone since she is a women, no matter how much ever we are humiliated by society or media we have to go through all. We cant even cry..I know this video will not get millions of views and it wont spread a lot. But from my side thumbs up to you and your efforst",

She stripped infront of me and started shouting as if she had some trouble just because I was going to tell my brother that she was cheating on him and it was her who had stolen my brothers mobile phone 2 months ago. Luckily she did that in front of my hostel room which had camera in gallery and at entrance. It all got recorded and I still have the recording of her first gently knocking on my door and then trying to tear her own clothes and shouting when I opened the door. But nevertheless, i got beaten up by 3 people including my hostel owner before even seeing the recording. Then the police arrived within 10 minutes and threw me into the jeep and verbally abused me asking me why I didnt respect girls and then again I was tortured and beaten up at the police station. And all this without even bothering to know the truth. They just wont listen to me. Thankfully, my hostel owner came to the police at midnight with the DVR and a separate digital copy of whole months' recordings of the hostel's cameras and paid for my bails.",

Why I felt it so much is the fact that I have already experienced the pain of having been implicated by a <b> woman </b>engaged by a highly rich man who had developed some baseless misunderstanding with me. I was charged with section 354 IPC and though I got acquitted in the very first hearing of the case, it took nearly five years repeatedly attending the Court just to get the next date, for a crime which was not committed by me at all.\n       Besides the criminal case I had to face the disciplinary proceedings as well facing suspension from my respectable job of a civil service for almost three years. I was exonerated in that case also but can the humiliation and the pain borne by me during those years be compensated ? \n        In the bargain for making false accusation against me the complaint/ so-called victim got registered as a builder and also got CST (exemption) registration with the help of the man who had plotted the conspiracy. Shameful was the role of one female local politician and few media persons, who were hired.\n           Worst was the connivance of two aides- one a relative of me, who is a builder and another a batch-mate (a DANICS officer), of me. Thank God my wife's greatness that I had no problem in my family life. On the contrary everybody supported me. But, the ordeal for five years was quite tormenting and has left an indelible pain in my heart.\n          I am a DANICS officer and my contact number is 8826707949.",

                    "commentText": "@Sambit Nayak We are born in a society where marriage is treated as sacrosanct, \nsomething which was fixed in heaven. It is a relationship valid not only\n in this life but also in lives yet to come. Nevertheless, this \nrelationship is changing and law has played a very important role in \naltering this relationship. The legislature drafted these laws to \nprotect the vulnerable women in the relationship, but while doing that \ndidn't keep in consideration abuse of these laws by not so vulnerable \nwomen. The judiciary, while sympathizing with the tears of women, didn't\n recognize the fact that these may be crocodile tears. Due to these \nreasons these laws has become a tool to harass husbands, extort money \nfrom husbands and their family, to torture hapless women of the husbands\n family. In short, these laws have made marriage more a legal \nrelationship than a social relationship. \nThe law presumes, everybody\n knows laws. Marriage is a voluntary relationship, in the sense that \ntill this point of time there is no law which can compel a man to marry \n(although in practice some women have compel men to marry them by \nleveling false allegation of rape against them. The recent case of \nsuicide by an ex-Army officer is a cse in point where the man committed \nsuicide due to pressure to marriage and in case of denial threat of \nfalse cases.). Thus every man must know the legal provisions before he \nenters into the legal relationship of marriage. If he enters without \nknowing these provisions, he cannot blame any other persons for that. \nHowever, it is the duty of legal practitioners and social workers to \nmake tem aware of these laws so that <b> nobody </b>enters into a legal \nrelationship of marriage without knowing its implications. Slowly and \nsteadily the number of law governing the relationship between husband \nand wife is increasing. One thing is<b>  common</b> in all laws- they are \nprejudiced and biased against the men in the sense that they give rights\n only to the wives and imposes duties only to the husband. Further the \nlanguage of the law is such that it facilitates abuse of these laws \nagainst the husband and his family members. And in fact also the wives \nare systematically abusing these laws. These laws were primarily \ndesigned to protect the vulnerable women in our society but the working \nof these laws suggest that they have become more a weapon of harassment \nand extortion in the hand of not so vulnerable women. The Hindu Marriage\n Act and the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act impose a duty upon the \nhusband to maintain their wife. However a person can claim maintenance \nonly if he/she is not able to maintain himself/herself. The term is \nability or potential to maintain and not mere inability to maintain at \nany point of time. However, a survey of the judgments will clearly shows\n that even when the wife was able bodies and educated then also the \ncourts have granted maintenance. Further, these two Acts are not \nsufficient and the Criminal Court is empowered to grant maintenance as \nper section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. More Acts for the \nsame relief means that the wife has more avenues to harass a husband \nthrough the process of Court. We can see that a wife has a right to \nmaintenance- but what is her duty. Law say<b> s nothin</b>g. If she abuses the \nhusband, then also she can claim maintenance. If she beats her \nmother-in-law, then also she can claim maintenance. Thus a wife has no \nduty, only rights. Just maintenance is not something to be very worried \nabout. What is more important that the wife has been given power to send\n the husband and his family members to the prison at wish? Under section\n 498A of t<b> he Indi</b>an Penal Code a wife can complain that she has been \ntreated with cruelty for dowry and name anybody in the relatives of the \nhusband. What is cruelty or what is dow<b> ry, nob</b>ody knows. A gift to \nhusband is dowry but a gift to wife is streedhan. A husband should not \ndemand any consideration for marriage, but a girl has a right to look \nfor a wealthy husband wi<b> th a</b> fat pay packet; it is not dowry, it is \npragmatism. The law says giving dowry is as criminal as taking dowry, \nthe wife screams that she has given dowry, but the law does not take any\n action against her- this is women empowerment. Under this Section \noctogenarian grand mom of husbands are being prosecuted for harassment- \nthis is power of wife. Just these are not sufficient. If your wife \ncommits suicide, invariably you will be prosecuted under Section 304B of\n the IPC. Here, even the prosecution has not prove many thing, Section \n113A is there in the Evidence Act to presume your guilt. When men commit\n suicide, the law is silent. After all men can commit suicide for so \nmany reasons- wife can commit suicide only after harassment by husband \nand his family. So what, the suicide statistics shows that more men \ncommit suicide. Once any of these cases are registered against you few \nthings are certain-like you are likely to loose your job. You will be \nmerely suspended if you are in government service. You will spend a \ncouple of months in jail before the bail. In jail too you will have full\n company of your family members. Finally, you will be granted bail and \nthe trial begins. What will happen in trial, I don't <b> know. I</b>ndian \nCriminal Justice system is totally biased against the accused. That is \nwhy making allegation in India has become an industry. It is a tool of \nlegal extortion in the hand of police and false accusers. Well, the \npurpose of this article is merely informing the worse half of the \npopulation the legal consequence of marriage and their vulnerably, if \nthey decide to marry. Difficult to imagine-even now men marry. In any<b>  \nca</b>se old habits die hard. There is no solution. We are living in Rule of\n Law and when the law is tyrannical and prejudiced, you cannot have a \nsolution. But, the risk can be reduced by taking recourse to written \ncontract at the time of marriage. It is a good idea to enter into \nwritten contract at the time of marriage with your would be wife. No law\n prohibits such type of contract. The contract can make provisions for \nexpenses of marriage ceremony, list of gifts received, the couple \ndecision regarding maintenance, child custody and all other items, which\n the couple feels necessary to incorporate in the written contract. It \nmay seem nauseating to introduce the idea of contract in marriage, but \nit is better as law has already entered into marriage. Written contract \nis just one mutually agreed way to reduce the rigor of falsehood in \ndeposition before the court. It is better to catch up a lawyer before \nthe police catch up with you.    \n      \n      \nShow less",

            "commentText": "I can agree that this talk makes legitimate points, but I have a single question:\u00a0\nIf you look at the statistics, in 2012, a total of 661 cases of rape were registered. Acquittal rate: 46%, i.e 304 resulted in acquittal. The next year, data was only available till August, which is over half the year. 318 cases were registered (less than half of the last year) and 237 acquittals were given, which lands us at a total of 75% of acquittals. So in over half the year, the number of rape cases registered fell, the acquittal rates rose, laws were changed to be made stricter after Nirbhaya (that's what Ms. Bhardwaj meant, I believe?), and yet those stricter laws led to higher acquittals. I don't understand this connection. Shouldn't tougher laws have meant more cases registered overall and lower acquittals?\n\nAdditionally, I agree that the laws should be changed to support both genders. Obviously, men need legal recourse in cases of false accusations and dowry violence too. Our long winded court system and unusual lack of investigation for confirmation can drive people to insane lengths. If we as women can't support that, we should at least support it for the simple fact that the more issues we have with people abusing the legal system, the more likely it is that necessary laws such as making marital rape a punishable offence will never see the light of day, simply because our judiciary system is too afraid of these laws being abused.",

Also, would like to add - possibly you may be aware - if these existing laws does not amend - there would be series of cases where whole family will be committing suicide - or Oppressed Men taking drastic step of killing spree - slaughtering their Wives and her family. Different People react to differently in same situation - so we cannot exclude such scenario. Men committing suicide would then turn into couple committing suicide and Men committing suicide after killing In-laws. Please highlight this point too; because it will soon be reality and Law makers should be aware about it. \"I am sure they need psychology lessons to understand such things\"",

I went to the counter alone for giving orders . A middle <b> age </b<b> >woman</b> was standing in front of me with her teenage daughter. I had a stuffy nose due to cough and cold so I was trying to breathe as I couldn't.. Suddenly tha<b> t Woma</b>n started shouting and abusing me literally by saying I was molesting her by blowing air. I was shocked, humiliated and speechless. I gave the order with teary eyes, they keep on abusing me and people were staring at me. I didnt get the power to call my girlfriend at that point.When I returned to the table, I couldn't even tell her and I started crying. After hearing the incident she ran to catch the lady but it was too late, Th<b> at wom</b>an had already left.

            "commentText": "So essentially, due to the face that for only for the past 30-40 years there are NOW laws that side with Women. Yes, we already spoke about how divorces technically at this point side with the women. These laws were created by MEN not women. These laws were created because of <b> gender </b>norms that were created from a patriarchal society to say that ONLY women can be empathetic and sympathetic enough to take care of children. Not to mention, only just recently were women just introduced into the workforce and can now have the ability to have a stable job and income. Before, this however.....marriage was essentially taken the women in as property. Women were traded in for money. By no means is this fair. There should be no rule saying that one side or the other must pay for the wedding. It is partnership between two people that love each other. That's it. If a marriage fails because of a billion sets of circumstances then it should be handled in a civil, equal, and just manner. This is why feminism is needed. Because feminism helps both women and men from breaking<b>  gender</b> norms and having the ability to live their lives where both genders are equal. There is no more saying - men must make money and the women can only take care of house and home. No more of that, which is the right direction to go to.\n\nSo, while people may be misusing it, she also said there are more laws coming out to help with this issue. That is why innocent until proven guilty exists. Also, these laws came into existence because women have had to deal with Domestic Violence and no way to protect themselves before hand. I'm not entirely certain about here statistics because I don't know the margin of error or the entity of which conducted. I did not see any comparative studies or statistical significance on her statistics.\n\nI understand her claim. I personally believe she's over reaching and when she's saying \"there is no entity helping men\" because every entity essentially helps men other wise. Th<b> e natio</b>n is built on t<b> he patriarc</b>hy and men do have automatic privilege which is why women specific entities exist.",

I'm a feminist and I have no shame in using that word because there are many unique issues that women have had to suffer from for thousands of years. But I'm also a humanist and \"meninist\" if there's such a word. I think the rights of men and women should be EQUAL and if there are laws that allow so many false cases to occur then I absolutely oppose the way they have been worded , implemented or misused. And I call upon a broader education of women to ensure they do not abuse the rights they now have, the rights delivered to them as a result of many many past years of activism by both men and women on their behalf. They should respect the vision of those activists by ensuring their actions don't make it harder for those around them to obtain the justice they deserve.",

            "commentText": "Thank you Deepika, for having the courage to speak up on this vital issue and the tenacity to build such compelling evidence to support your arguments.\nLong years ago, as a reporter in Chennai, I once went to the family court to cover a case. It was a divorce case. The husband claimed infidelity. The wife cried and cried. The whole courtroom looked at the man as the villain. At some point, the case was adjourned and everybody came out. Then, in front of everybody, the <b> woman </b>joined hands with another man, they laughed together and went away in an autorickshaw. It was obvious to any onlooker that she was having an affair. But the law itself didn't recognize it. I can never forget how pained that man was when he saw his lawfully wedded wife going away in an intimate huddle with another man.\nMore than 20 years later, the situation has gotten only worse as your cases clearly prove. The men can't talk about it because we are immediately accused for being sexist. It is women like you who can bring about change. Power to you!",

And which law actually punish the rapiest. The victimised women's lives are never returned by any law neither by society. How could the <b> Indian </b>constitution be told as the best when both the genders are just victim of it only. One similar thing is reservation. 49.5 % roughly 50% seats are reserved. Firstly this 50% for minorities shows the majority is actual minority. Secondly if 50% of<b>  indian</b> power is not in hands of capable by deeds, but capable by birth, how could India develop. The generations of freedom fighters, those whose parents ever gave the tax; more over who are actually capable are the most useless sons of the mother land. Its more over our MOTHER LAND IS CHEATING ON US on the name of democracy, elections, vote banks, power distribution etc which just implies exploitation. Wish to join .",

A crooked mind is dangerous, and that mind can be of either women or men.The dowry law is an <b> old </b>law which was made in thought of the unreported dowry cases where the true victims are women and still they dont have any evidence to prove it.Same goes for the rape law which is strong if the victim is the real target of rape but its misuse is equally unjust.But since dowry tradition has become low,there is a need of discussion on this law.No women nor men should suffer and justice should be rightly served.\nBut still after seeing and reading fake molestation and rape cases articles, it scares me to be with and make female friends.Forget dating and marrying one.",

This happens not only in INDIA but also in WB..!!\n\nScenario:\n\n17 Years girl died in hospital due to excessive bleeding from the private organ-\n\nFIR/164 by her mother says-\n\n1. Raped by school teacher and mother did not know when she had been raped.\n2. As per the FIR mother said that her kid was sick for 10 days due to bleeding and brought to hospital on 10th day and girl given the dying declaration about the incident in front of Dr.\n3. As per her mother bleeding was due to pills given by the teacher when she came to know that she was pregnant.\n\nPM Report says\n\n1.Wound in the left side of fundus(female organ),\u00a0burse in the cervix region, wound in sigmoid colon. 250gm blood clotted inside the female organ. Anti mortem in nature. -----Contradiction with 164,FIR.\n2. No pregnancy sign found.------Contradiction with 164,FIR.\n\nHospital Dr report says:\n\nIn 1st\u00a0two hospitals of total three hospitals girl was conscious and did not say anything to the Dr.\u00a0\u00a0So no dying declaration.Contradiction with 164,FIR.\n\nOur clarification:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe teacher(accused) is in bail now from high\u00a0court\u00a0after 8 months of jail\u00a0-\n\n1. Police did not identified the village local Dr( Koack) who is responsible for the wound. So that right offender will be identified( with whom girl was having the relation)\u00a0.Even we have informed to\u00a0higher police official and ordered to HIGHEST POLICE OFFICIAL to identify the person. But no action. CS (376,314,302 and section 6) was already submitted.\u00a0\n2. Can police get punishment for the incorrect investigation(false). What all are the IPCs.\n3. Is there any way to book the right offender?\n\nNote: Police and mother\u00a0demanded money\u00a0to settle the case at the beginning. But the teacher did not agreed. (No evidence) .",

This means that if she gets what she wants, women would be imprisoned if they are unable to prove that dowry was asked for. Secondly she speaks highly in favor of the Save<b>  Indian</b> Family Foundation (SIFF); an organization that is actively working to decriminalize marital rape, citing the justification that families would break down if men are not allowed to rape their wives. (Consistent with SIFF's ideology) She also subtly mentions that the law against marital rape can be misused. Well every law can be misused. Even if her concern is indeed men's rights, she doesn't try to find out causes (structural or otherwise) of problems that victimize men, but looks for instances where 498A was misused and reduces the violence against \"Men\" to the misuse of 498A. There is indeed a lot of work being done against structural oppression which victimize men. But the way in which the forms of violence affect men is much different in different contexts (eg. in prisons, i<b> n menta</b>l hospitals, in the military, and even within marriages the intersections with class, caste, disability, sexuality are necessary to be considered) and hence we \"Men\" are not generally categorized (and justifiably so) a socially oppressed group. This is not about human rights (or men's rights) but about rubbing it into the faces of women and feminists that \"Men are the victims here.\"",

You want false cases to be flagged against men so that you can extort money. You are running a women's organisation that makes good business by this legalised extortion. Feminism is shit and you are a testimony to that.",

Justice should be constantly worked upon to ensure that it is <b> gender </b>neutral. When individuals feel distressed, irrespective of whether they are a man or a<b>  woman</b>, they deserve a good system to help them overcome their problems. An intelligent society is ever evolving and impartial to both genders.",

Yes, several families are being harassed and torn apart because of 498A and other laws that were made to protect women. My father was a lawyer and so I have seen many cases where Men and their families were falsely accused (some strangers and some families we knew personally). But I have one little concern with what Deepika is doing; though I have no problem with Deepika and her work, but I have seen several misogynists using her work and activism to cover their filthy agenda of female oppression. I dont believe in Feminism and certainly dont believe in Male\u00a0(or any <b> gender'</b>s) superiority over another<b>  gender</b>, but like 498A, and modern Feminism, even Deepika's work is being abused by these filthy people to cover up their dirt. And so, I am worried that similar to 498A and Feminism (the original movement), this thing might take an ugly turn like what extreme Feminism is today. And this idea scares me!",

Now with women having much more independence in spending than men of today, the media and the major companies are interested in attracting them more aggressively. In order to do that\n\n1.they take an idea that already exists in society.\n2. blow it out of proportion\u00a0\n3.brand their products as somehow aligned/promoting the idea.\n\nIn this case the idea is that of feminine superiority. It sells very nicely in India because we already accept female divinity in form of Godesses. So they take up this idea and connect being female equivalent to being divine and then paint a narrative around it. It has become so bad that even discussion around this topic is becoming difficult in the civil society. Every time a man stands up to question this, he is branded as <b> chauvinist.</b> Every time a<b>  woman</b> chastises a man she is branded as progressive. This leads to even a lack of discussion on the fairness of the existing laws. Being <b> a woma</b>n is seen as being a brand ambassador for change, innovation, freedom. This makes it very hard being a man. The idea of marriage itself is a trap for a man. In fact the intelligent man of this time \u00a0should never get married. Because he gai<b> ns nothi</b>ng by that and looses everything. Its a win-lose(win for women).<b>  No Ind</b>ian man of today should ever fall into the trap of marryin<b> g an In</b<b> >dian </b>woman.",

Of adults, men only make up about 7% and are far less likely to die. However, it's actually often run by women. There are many factors involved that make human trafficking easier for women, a victim wont even suspect another <b> woman </b>and there are women who take advantage of that. Police also don't suspect women. There are enough evil women out there willing to make a<b>  buck</b> off other women. Men on the other hand tend to get caught. But again, I will say the consumers of female slaves are probably men.\nTh<b> e se</b>x trade in the US is incredibly bad. Something like 120k new women every year and roughly 50% of them die within 4 years.",

Many girls are filing\u00a0false\u00a0cases of rape while its consensual<b>  sex</b> just to get her revenge.\n\nGuys I would recommend not to marry till things get sorted. Till then \"apna haath jagannath\" \"use your hand\" its a big deal even saves a lot of money if u get\u00a0 what I mean :p or pump & dump.\n\nBcause of 498A and latest happenings in india I have stopped travelling in share auto with women prefer travelling with men instead.\n\nThings have to change.

            "commentText": "It is totally true. History is full of examples of how the system has been gamed by individuals to unleash their personal vendetta.\nLook, the truth is that most of the people want to live happily, want to be provided with opportunities where they can work and make life better for all around them. Women have been historically oppressed by men - by both their enemies and their friends. That is true and I empathize with that. Men should treat women better than the discrimination that is going on.\nBut, these laws and the recent surge of \"A man saw me, he is a rapist\" is making things really worse for people. It is important to understand that women too can be sociopaths/psychopaths, like many of the men.\nAs for the current situation, when I am at a public place or even at work place, I fear women. I try not to look at them. When I talk I try to keep things to a minimum, avoid courtesy and never joke. I fear women and I am very young now.\nI remember when lining up at a bank, I moved quickly to get an empty spot and a <b> woman </b>also tried to get there but I was faster so, I got there first. The<b>  woman</b> created a ruckus as per how \"I treated my sister and mother\" and the guard intervened to put me at the end of another line.\nI am an introvert, I rarely talk to strangers and I think a 100 times before I take any action and I am 100% sure, I never even looked at tha<b> t woma</b>n. But, people present there laughed at my \"sanskar\".\nI felt humiliated and stopped my tears. But, that is part of life I am fully aware of now.\nWherever I go now, I try to keep a good distance with a<b> ny wom</b>an. Sometimes, I have left my change at shops when there are female cashiers. And I think it is correct because I prefer losing some money than accepting the possibility of being humiliated for no reason.",

But no response.\n*********************** Letter to Girl's Brother***********\nHope you are doing fine. I would like to talk to you. Can I have your telephone number please. It's better not to bring notice to my brother's in-laws family that I have been contacted you. So that my brother would get tortured mentally, financially and extorted in so many other ways. They do not like that we keep contact with my brother and they also do not like that my family contact any of you. The marriage is not only have the responsibility Anamika's parents but also you and your other relatives who were in the front. My brother is not only my brother but also like my son. It is the same pain I will have if he is being tortured. The main root of all the situations are Anamika's \u00a0dad and he is making all those doing by his daughter and wife. In India every now and then Anamika use to threaten for suicide if Pradip do not send money and/or whatever Anamika wants( which is well planned by her Dad). They use to threaten via IPC 498 while my brother is in India and if she commits suicide then she will give all the blame to my Brother and trying to extorted the money as per my brother. Thos incidents happened in front of Anamika's \u00a0parents( while they are in blor) and also informed those Anamika's \u00a0maternal uncle( who is in Gujrat) earlier. You may also speak to the house owner(rented) of Blor and how Anamika quarrels with my brother and You also know the rule of America. While Anamika quarrels if anyone complaints 911 by listening this my brother will be in trouble. This quarrel stops when Anamika transfers the money from my brother's account to India ( Anamika's \u00a0Dad's account). Approximately 5 Lacs INR already transferred by doing the emotional blackmail, <b> mental </b>torture. All those incidents is not the sign of GOOD family background. Those all happens in BASTI family. My brother is so terrified that he calls us during his office time and never from the home, else he will be get tortured. Also they barely have the physical relationship. Last one year 20 times, as per my brother.\n\nAll together my brother spent approximately (INR 10 Lacks of transferring goods from blor-kol, kol- blor, Travel of Anamika's parents from Kol- blor and in USA). My brother is so much terrified that he never informed that Anamika's \u00a0family made themselves travel to USA.\n\nWe need your help to resolve this issues. You are experienced enough and educated enough to handle this situation very delicately. I am just begging you to resolve this.\n\nThanks",

So much that now even if i get signals (that is what maximum you get from girls in India, they are hardly the one who would approach first) , i just ignore them.\n\u00a0That time around some high court or the 'honourable' Supreme court passed a law which gave live in same status as marriage. And I was in one. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0I found myself hating the feminists for the simple reason that they think they have the supreme vision. Look society has flaws which have developed in centuries and to get rid of them in one shot by passing some unfair law is sad. This gives the society a chance of revolution and most of the revolutions which are fast tend to create social imbalance and this will end the institution of marriage. <b> Old </b>people don't appreciate this feminism and they are right in their perspective. So all my sisters out there, please take it slow. You may not be able to see the utopian dream come true anyway in your lifetime but when you really want to serve the humanity, you need to have dedication and the wisdom that no farmer has ever ate all the fruits of the tree he has nurtured. God bless humanity and long live marriages!!\n\nMay be 100 years or may be 200 years down the line, we will have fair and just society. But still there will be some jobs which men will excel at and some women will. Don't go so fast that we the men start thinking that it is a fight with the inner self. After-all we believe in the story of ardh-nari-ishwar. I hope that we work together like body and soul. Take something out other does not make much sense.",

                    "commentText": "Beware of marriage! We are born in a society where marriage is treated as sacrosanct, \nsomething which was fixed in heaven. It is a relationship valid not only\n in this life but also in lives yet to come. Nevertheless, this \nrelationship is changing and law has played a very important role in \naltering this relationship. The legislature drafted these laws to \nprotect the vulnerable women in the relationship, but while doing that \ndidn't keep in consideration abuse of these laws by not so vulnerable \nwomen. The judiciary, while sympathizing with the tears of women, didn't\n recognize the fact that these may be crocodile tears. Due to these \nreasons these laws has become a tool to harass husbands, extort money \nfrom husbands and their family, to torture hapless women of the husbands\n family. In short, these laws have made marriage more a legal \nrelationship than a social relationship. \nThe law presumes, everybody\n knows laws. Marriage is a voluntary relationship, in the sense that \ntill this point of time there is no law which can compel a man to marry \n(although in practice some women have compel men to marry them by \nleveling false allegation of rape against them. The recent case of \nsuicide by an ex-Army officer is a cse in point where the man committed \nsuicide due to pressure to marriage and in case of denial threat of \nfalse cases.). Thus every man must know the legal provisions before he \nenters into the legal relationship of marriage. If he enters without \nknowing these provisions, he cannot blame any other persons for that. \nHowever, it is the duty of legal practitioners and social workers to \nmake tem aware of these laws so that <b> nobody </b>enters into a legal \nrelationship of marriage without knowing its implications. Slowly and \nsteadily the number of law governing the relationship between husband \nand wife is increasing. One thing is<b>  common</b> in all laws- they are \nprejudiced and biased against the men in the sense that they give rights\n only to the wives and imposes duties only to the husband. Further the \nlanguage of the law is such that it facilitates abuse of these laws \nagainst the husband and his family members. And in fact also the wives \nare systematically abusing these laws. These laws were primarily \ndesigned to protect the vulnerable women in our society but the working \nof these laws suggest that they have become more a weapon of harassment \nand extortion in the hand of not so vulnerable women. The Hindu Marriage\n Act and the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act impose a duty upon the \nhusband to maintain their wife. However a person can claim maintenance \nonly if he/she is not able to maintain himself/herself. The term is \nability or potential to maintain and not mere inability to maintain at \nany point of time. However, a survey of the judgments will clearly shows\n that even when the wife was able bodies and educated then also the \ncourts have granted maintenance. Further, these two Acts are not \nsufficient and the Criminal Court is empowered to grant maintenance as \nper section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. More Acts for the \nsame relief means that the wife has more avenues to harass a husband \nthrough the process of Court. We can see that a wife has a right to \nmaintenance- but what is her duty. Law say<b> s nothin</b>g. If she abuses the \nhusband, then also she can claim maintenance. If she beats her \nmother-in-law, then also she can claim maintenance. Thus a wife has no \nduty, only rights. Just maintenance is not something to be very worried \nabout. What is more important that the wife has been given power to send\n the husband and his family members to the prison at wish? Under section\n 498A of t<b> he Indi</b>an Penal Code a wife can complain that she has been \ntreated with cruelty for dowry and name anybody in the relatives of the \nhusband. What is cruelty or what is dow<b> ry, nob</b>ody knows. A gift to \nhusband is dowry but a gift to wife is streedhan. A husband should not \ndemand any consideration for marriage, but a girl has a right to look \nfor a wealthy husband wi<b> th a</b> fat pay packet; it is not dowry, it is \npragmatism. The law says giving dowry is as criminal as taking dowry, \nthe wife screams that she has given dowry, but the law does not take any\n action against her- this is women empowerment. Under this Section \noctogenarian grand mom of husbands are being prosecuted for harassment- \nthis is power of wife. Just these are not sufficient. If your wife \ncommits suicide, invariably you will be prosecuted under Section 304B of\n the IPC. Here, even the prosecution has not prove many thing, Section \n113A is there in the Evidence Act to presume your guilt. When men commit\n suicide, the law is silent. After all men can commit suicide for so \nmany reasons- wife can commit suicide only after harassment by husband \nand his family. So what, the suicide statistics shows that more men \ncommit suicide. Once any of these cases are registered against you few \nthings are certain-like you are likely to loose your job. You will be \nmerely suspended if you are in government service. You will spend a \ncouple of months in jail before the bail. In jail too you will have full\n company of your family members. Finally, you will be granted bail and \nthe trial begins. What will happen in trial, I don't <b> know. I</b>ndian \nCriminal Justice system is totally biased against the accused. That is \nwhy making allegation in India has become an industry. It is a tool of \nlegal extortion in the hand of police and false accusers. Well, the \npurpose of this article is merely informing the worse half of the \npopulation the legal consequence of marriage and their vulnerably, if \nthey decide to marry. Difficult to imagine-even now men marry. In any<b>  \nca</b>se old habits die hard. There is no solution. We are living in Rule of\n Law and when the law is tyrannical and prejudiced, you cannot have a \nsolution. But, the risk can be reduced by taking recourse to written \ncontract at the time of marriage. It is a good idea to enter into \nwritten contract at the time of marriage with your would be wife. No law\n prohibits such type of contract. The contract can make provisions for \nexpenses of marriage ceremony, list of gifts received, the couple \ndecision regarding maintenance, child custody and all other items, which\n the couple feels necessary to incorporate in the written contract. It \nmay seem nauseating to introduce the idea of contract in marriage, but \nit is better as law has already entered into marriage. Written contract \nis just one mutually agreed way to reduce the rigor of falsehood in \ndeposition before the court. It is better to catch up a lawyer before \nthe police catch up with you.",

                    "commentText": "@2010\nWe are born in a society where marriage is treated as sacrosanct, \nsomething which was fixed in heaven. It is a relationship valid not only\n in this life but also in lives yet to come. Nevertheless, this \nrelationship is changing and law has played a very important role in \naltering this relationship. The legislature drafted these laws to \nprotect the vulnerable women in the relationship, but while doing that \ndidn't keep in consideration abuse of these laws by not so vulnerable \nwomen. The judiciary, while sympathizing with the tears of women, didn't\n recognize the fact that these may be crocodile tears. Due to these \nreasons these laws has become a tool to harass husbands, extort money \nfrom husbands and their family, to torture hapless women of the husbands\n family. In short, these laws have made marriage more a legal \nrelationship than a social relationship. \n\nThe law presumes, everybody\n knows laws. Marriage is a voluntary relationship, in the sense that \ntill this point of time there is no law which can compel a man to marry \n(although in practice some women have compel men to marry them by \nleveling false allegation of rape against them. The recent case of \nsuicide by an ex-Army officer is a cse in point where the man committed \nsuicide due to pressure to marriage and in case of denial threat of \nfalse cases.). Thus every man must know the legal provisions before he \nenters into the legal relationship of marriage. If he enters without \nknowing these provisions, he cannot blame any other persons for that. \nHowever, it is the duty of legal practitioners and social workers to \nmake tem aware of these laws so that <b> nobody </b>enters into a legal \nrelationship of marriage without knowing its implications. Slowly and \nsteadily the number of law governing the relationship between husband \nand wife is increasing. One thing is<b>  common</b> in all laws- they are \nprejudiced and biased against the men in the sense that they give rights\n only to the wives and imposes duties only to the husband. Further the \nlanguage of the law is such that it facilitates abuse of these laws \nagainst the husband and his family members. And in fact also the wives \nare systematically abusing these laws. These laws were primarily \ndesigned to protect the vulnerable women in our society but the working \nof these laws suggest that they have become more a weapon of harassment \nand extortion in the hand of not so vulnerable women. The Hindu Marriage\n Act and the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act impose a duty upon the \nhusband to maintain their wife. However a person can claim maintenance \nonly if he/she is not able to maintain himself/herself. The term is \nability or potential to maintain and not mere inability to maintain at \nany point of time. However, a survey of the judgments will clearly shows\n that even when the wife was able bodies and educated then also the \ncourts have granted maintenance. Further, these two Acts are not \nsufficient and the Criminal Court is empowered to grant maintenance as \nper section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. More Acts for the \nsame relief means that the wife has more avenues to harass a husband \nthrough the process of Court. We can see that a wife has a right to \nmaintenance- but what is her duty. Law say<b> s nothin</b>g. If she abuses the \nhusband, then also she can claim maintenance. If she beats her \nmother-in-law, then also she can claim maintenance. Thus a wife has no \nduty, only rights. Just maintenance is not something to be very worried \nabout. What is more important that the wife has been given power to send\n the husband and his family members to the prison at wish? Under section\n 498A of t<b> he Indi</b>an Penal Code a wife can complain that she has been \ntreated with cruelty for dowry and name anybody in the relatives of the \nhusband. What is cruelty or what is dow<b> ry, nob</b>ody knows. A gift to \nhusband is dowry but a gift to wife is streedhan. A husband should not \ndemand any consideration for marriage, but a girl has a right to look \nfor a wealthy husband wi<b> th a</b> fat pay packet; it is not dowry, it is \npragmatism. The law says giving dowry is as criminal as taking dowry, \nthe wife screams that she has given dowry, but the law does not take any\n action against her- this is women empowerment. Under this Section \noctogenarian grand mom of husbands are being prosecuted for harassment- \nthis is power of wife. Just these are not sufficient. If your wife \ncommits suicide, invariably you will be prosecuted under Section 304B of\n the IPC. Here, even the prosecution has not prove many thing, Section \n113A is there in the Evidence Act to presume your guilt. When men commit\n suicide, the law is silent. After all men can commit suicide for so \nmany reasons- wife can commit suicide only after harassment by husband \nand his family. So what, the suicide statistics shows that more men \ncommit suicide. Once any of these cases are registered against you few \nthings are certain-like you are likely to loose your job. You will be \nmerely suspended if you are in government service. You will spend a \ncouple of months in jail before the bail. In jail too you will have full\n company of your family members. Finally, you will be granted bail and \nthe trial begins. What will happen in trial, I don't <b> know. I</b>ndian \nCriminal Justice system is totally biased against the accused. That is \nwhy making allegation in India has become an industry. It is a tool of \nlegal extortion in the hand of police and false accusers. Well, the \npurpose of this article is merely informing the worse half of the \npopulation the legal consequence of marriage and their vulnerably, if \nthey decide to marry. Difficult to imagine-even now men marry. In any<b>  \nca</b>se old habits die hard. There is no solution. We are living in Rule of\n Law and when the law is tyrannical and prejudiced, you cannot have a \nsolution. But, the risk can be reduced by taking recourse to written \ncontract at the time of marriage. It is a good idea to enter into \nwritten contract at the time of marriage with your would be wife. No law\n prohibits such type of contract. The contract can make provisions for \nexpenses of marriage ceremony, list of gifts received, the couple \ndecision regarding maintenance, child custody and all other items, which\n the couple feels necessary to incorporate in the written contract. It \nmay seem nauseating to introduce the idea of contract in marriage, but \nit is better as law has already entered into marriage. Written contract \nis just one mutually agreed way to reduce the rigor of falsehood in \ndeposition before the court. It is better to catch up a lawyer before \nthe police catch up with you.",

We wouldn't be talking about the problems both sexes face because it wouldn't even be part of our reality.\n\n\"it was generally unfair for EVERYONE in the past, not just one group, if women werent allowed to work, men were forced to be breadwinners and hence do jobs that theymight not otherwise like\"\n\nyep. When one group is oppressed, it follows that the other also suffers. Since people are interdependent, when you hurt one half, the other half must be \"double\" responsible for the things the first half lacks (and vice versa) and is thus hurt in return. The benefits of each group are lopsided, but it balances itself out in the harm everyone faces. Hence, inequality.\n\nSadly, at this point in time, we'restill divided, with people on both sides pushing and fighting each other. It's a necessary step though because it serves as a lesson.",

Now a days women are the most victim of these bahu centric laws. Laws should be made to punish wrong doers and family breakers but not innocent people. Our 498A fails to test basic rule of Law which is \" Its okay to acquit 10 wrong doers but its a crime that one innocent will suffer\". IN 498A 98.99% sufferres are innocent and 498A is 5000% worst law in india.\n\nThanks again Deepika for all your hard work and help to save <b> indian </b>families!!",

It's because of feminists groups and activists.. and many of those are white Western feminists who are part of organizations like UNWOMEN, which put huge pressure of governments, and purposely ignore male victims and suffering. They even alter or \"conveniently ignore\" statistics and studies which clearly indicate that half of victims of violence, DV, and poverty are male. So maybe rather than commenting here about how feminists supposedly want equality, you should go to places like UNWOMEN and put your case forward.. \"As a feminist, I oppose the blatant anti-male policies you have in place, what you are doing is bigoted and wrong.\"",

My life is very well fortunately, unlike some poor other people who don't get the same opportunities as me. Also stop saying that feminism promotes war between men and women. Feminism wants equal opportunities for both. I've explained this to you before. If a father sends his son to study abroad, he should also do the same for his daughter instead of thinking \"what's the use, she's anyway going to get married and there' no need to higher education\" and mind you, a lot of well educated people still think like that. Men and women need to both be happy. A man should be able to pick the kind of lifestyle he wants and makes him happy while similarly, a<b>  woman</b> should be able to do the same. No one is telling a housewife to go out and party (like you've mentioned before) but a housewife should know that if she wants to, she should be able to. Most of them are forced ti remain in the kitchen by their in laws and it's sad.\n@Jonathan Small\u00a0I don't think she ever mentioned reinforcement of patriarcha<b> l gende</b>r roles, in fact quite the opposite.

Masculinity for me is not about building muscles like Sylvester Stallone. If muscles were the only criterion of masculinity then literary and musical geniuses like Shakespeare and Beethoven wouldn't be masculine. Similarly if masculinity was only about muscles, then scientists like Einstein and Hawking wouldn't be masculine. So for me masculinity is all about performing to the highest levels against all the odds. Therefore masculinity is an ideal that every young boy should strive for in order to excel in whichever field he chooses.\n\nFeminism however wants to destroy all aspects of masculinity by painting a false picture of \"toxic masculinity\". Feminists claim that ideals of masculinity is putting a lot of pressure on young men. Bloody hell! If a few cry babies can't take pressure, how will they succeed in their lives? Feminists want men to become more \"sensitive\" so that they become incapable of taking pressure in life. Such men will be easier to control by feminist lobby.\n\nThat is precisely why I don't support Emma. If she cares about men, then she must let men embrace their true identity instead of forcing them to be more feminine by saying<b>  \"patriarch</b>y hurts men\" and other bullshit.",

Whereas if he wants to be sensitive and feminine, again, completely up to him. Your definition of masculinity is a lot different from what others may think. For some it might just be the fact that they can grow a beard.\nAs for men who chose the non-masculine part, most of them are not accepted into society. They are made fun of in their own friend circle. A sensitive man could be perceived as \"girly\" and why is that ever a problem? Shouldn't any person have the right to choose how they want to be and not live a lie because of what and how society tells them they should behave?\nA man's true identity could be anything.

Masculinity is all about performance. It can be science, mathematics, music, dance, literature or anything. And I already gave examples of Shakespeare, Beethoven and Einstein. Those men are masculine but not the Arnold Schwarzenegger type.\n\nA man can behave feminine. I have no problem with that as long as he is an expert in his field. It can be painting, agriculture, sculpturing or anything he wants.\n\nNow regarding the girly part. Most of the stereotypes of \"girly\" and \"<b> effeminate\"</b> men are perpetrated mostly by girls. I have met plenty of girls in my life who believe that men should not cry. The reason why girly men are made fun of by other men is because the other men are concerned as to how this guy will win a girl. But these days that has reduced. Men are more accepting of all forms of men because we know that we are an endangered species.\n\nNow regarding sensitivity. Little sensitivity is fine. But these days people are overtly sensitive to literally anything in this world. As I said in my previous comment, if someone has to be a cry baby about every little thing, how will he/she face the real world?\n\nFeminists are the ones who want men to live a lie. Accepting feminine men is fine. But they also want masculine men to turn feminine. Feminists are the ones telling men how to behave. It is all a social engineering plan.",

But there's definitely distrust between the two genders which is only growing right now. Women have been oppressed for quite sometime and I support feminism because I've grown up with the same privileges as my brother. I am expected to learn housework like cooking, serving etc occasionally while my brother is not. And no, my brother is not expected to do manly work. If I can lift something, I do. It all depends on physical strength and the load of say the luggage or things like that. But above that, I am given the same opportunities as him and I am thankful. I don't complain about occasionally serving the guests at home or demanding that he be asked to do it. Having brought up this way, it almost seems illogical for women to be treated differently than men because I don't see any inherent differences between my brother's abilities and my own (except physical strength which he worked towards and I did not). Women are still being oppressed due to social structure that was created but it is changing and we are thankful for that. But there's more work to be done. \n\nComing to this video,<b>  Indian</b> men are particularly threatened by this particular law or any other which could b<b> e gende</b>r biased. It needs to be revised. And I say revised because even though this law is being misused, there's still relevance of it right now. Also, I think most people would rather give dowry than make a case against it. Dowry is also demanded after the marriage sometimes which might be even more problematic for the girl's family as their girl's marriage and life is at stake. So, there is a problem. But perhaps the educat<b> ed Indi</b>an girl who has had all the privileges in life should not victimise herself. Instead we should fight for those women who are denied of these rights. There's a lack of awareness about these things in illiterate families or conservative middle class families with little inclination towards education. There's only talk of it on Internet forums like this which is why there's less progress in a country like India where Internet and education is still a dream for many. \n\nWe don't need to arm up against each other. I get that you're irritated with the fact t<b> hat nob</b>ody is standing up for men but this is how women (women all over the world) felt at one point. But you see two women on this thread telling you that we do support anybody who has been wronged. That's a start. More awareness about these issues will definitely change the scenario. More women will talk about it, I promise. But you will have to wait just like those women waited for their rights and those who still do (but will probably wait all their life). If you become vindictive and women-hating like a lot of those in this comment section, it wil<b> l do no</b>body any <b> good. Mis</b>and<b> ry and fe</b>minazi ideas are not the solution. It's absolutely disrespectful towards those men who're honest and noble. There, I said it.",

Yet I was not surprised that you purposefully removed the context of what I said:\u00a0 \"Alimony is different - in Europe, it can be traced as far back as Roman times, and reflects on the natural gynocentricity all humans have (and which is what is exploited by feminism) .\"\n\nSuch actions are very typical of feminists in public discourse, so I am not surprised by this behaviour, but can you see how different what I said is when compared to what you claimed I implied? Or will you obstinately insist that what you claim I implied is the kernel of what I said?\nOf course it isn't. The central point of what I said is that all humans (hint:this means both sexes) are gynocentric. This is the naturally evolved state for mankind: value the female as primary, and protect her.\n\nBe honest when you look around you, and you'll see that everything is set up to favour, and make things easier, for the female.\n\nAnyone with even a first grade understanding of basic biology knows the first thing any male animal does is use its strength and power to protect and impress the females, and to dominate, humiliate, or even eliminate\u00a0 other males. While this is a simplistic model for human behaviour, it remains at is core. A little bit of thought will reveal the insight that having the human female as the <b> sexual </b>selector in our species, further enhances the benefits of<b>  sexual</b> dimorphousness.\u00a0 (viz. recombinant DNA advantages defences against pathogens)\n\nAnd why are such basic insights anathema to feminists?\nBecause they give the lie to the central tenets of feminism:\u00a0 \"Th<b> e Patriarch</b>y\"\u2122; women lack agency; and women are oppressed.\n\n\"T<b> he Patriarc</b>hy\"\u2122 is a myth invented out of the airy nothingness and is at the core of feminism because this mythical system\u00a0 - which is claimed to have been set up by men to ensure advantage for other men through the subjugation of women - is\u00a0 intentionally intertwined with the second myth of women having no agency, allowing for the easy establishment of the third myth of women being \"oppressed\", so as to exploit that status of \"victimhood\".\n\nThat is what feminism <b> is: noth</b>ing more than a marketing strategy, designed to appeal to human nature.\n\n---\n\nNaturally emerging systems of societal power and influence include both patriarchal and matriarchal systems - at the same time. While the publicly visible, externally-focused, ones are almost always patriarchal, it is the sub-current of family-focused, usually matriarchal systems which exert the deepest influence on society.\n\nThis is not new knowledge, it has been known for aeons, and even formal modern studies describing this have been published - since over 40 years ago:  [LINK] ",

Erin's benefactors were all men - they funded her, supported her, and enabled her initial success. The feminists, on the other hand, were apalled when Erin publicly stated that she had established that women were equally as violent as their partners, and that Erin felt battered men also merited similar support. The feminists then operated an incessant campaign of public harassment, even shooting her family's pet dog, and eventually Erin had no choice but to live in exile, for some 30 years...\n\n(It was Erin Pizzey's successful instantiation of the world's first women's shelter, which was hijacked by the feminist movement, and which gave rise to the Domestic Violence industry, which today is the gravy train funding feminism by diverting astronomical amounts of public money into women-only projects. )\n\n---\nps.

A lot of people are too ethnocentric to look through the lenses of the other person and I think thats how these<b>  gender</b> specific laws are enforced. It reminds me of the federal law in Arizona;\u00a0Arizona Senate Bill 1070 which allows police men to racially profile minorities as suspects of illegal immigrants.

Women have always as caring and nurturing and \"born mothers\" and hence no one thinks twice when it comes to handing over a child in her hands. but when it comes to the man, there's things like how will he take care of it, how can he be sensitive to the needs to the child, will he teach the child the rights manners and whatever else.\nThe only reason that is still happening is because of<b>  gender</b> biased laws and roles. Where is the equality in it? Women might have the \"privilege\" in some cases, like laws created favoring women (only because they have been exploited in the past because o<b> f gende</b>r) or having scholarships for women (because the government/organisation wants to encourage women to step into a field usually dominated by men) or allowing women free entry in nightclubs while most men have to wait outside (so that men will wait the wait and want to be with scores of women and drinks inside the club) but truthfully, none of us look at it like that. All of this is just put into place to reverse an equality that has been culturally ingrained. And instead of being thankful for the opportunity to corre<b> ct gend</b>er inequality and make it better for both men and women, a few horrid women have used these things to her advantage to gain more.\u00a0\n\nFeminists are trying to also bring into the picture that it is not women who are being raped and are victims of domestic abuse, a man is too. But then society laughs and says, how can any man be raped? A man always enj<b> oys </b>sex. And how can a man be overpowered and hit <b> by a w</b>oman? But these thing keep occurring! A man can be sensitive and can fall prey to such happenings. That doesn't make him any less of a man! When a 20<b>  yea</b<b> >r old</b> woman raped a <b> 14 y</b>ear old boy, most men commented how he should have had fun and enjoyed being with an older exp<b> erienc</b>ed woman, whereas a majority of the women were appalled. If men cannot recognize the trauma of another man, where do e stand here? Most women will recognize the trauma of a <b> victim </b>of sexual assault (male or female) because already a majority of us have been there already, may have experienced it to a small extent or may have had our friends be victims here, and we completely understand. But since MOST men don't know how it feels, they will keep thinking like they do. This is the mind set of people. If we cannot change that, we will never be happy. It's as simple as that.",

Also \u00a0according to the an article in the magazine the Economist \"Goldman Sachs calculates that, leaving all other things equal, increasing women's participation in the labor market to male levels will boost GDP by 21% in Italy, 19% in Spain, 16% in Japan, 9% in America, France and Germany and 8% in Britain.\"\n\n2) Feminists played a major role in ending the stigma associated with HIV patients\n\n3) \u00a0Thanks to the \" Rape is Rape\" campaign led by feminist activists of Feminist Majority Foundation and Ms. magazine,\u00a0the FBI's definition of rape now recognizes raping a man as rape. While the definition since 1921 was only recognized the forceful <b> sexual </b>act on women.\n\n4) \u00a0The National Organization for Women and many other social injustice advocacy groups worked towards changing the national definition of hate crime to include<b>  gender</b><b> , rac</b><b> e, sexu</b>al orientation and disability.\n\n5) With the rise of feminism the idea of what it means to be a man has changed immensely for the better. They can be loving fathers, they can participate in careers stigmatized before as \"feminine\" such as teachers and nurses, they are not the only ones responsible for fighting in the army and allowed men to voice out against violence,\n\n6) Finally without the efforts of women to gain equal rights between men and women there would not be many inventions we have today such as the jockstrap, the medical syringe, \u00a0wind shield wipers, bullet proof vests, all the discoveries or Marie Curie \u00a0and many more\n\nFeminists have been fighting for decades equal opportunity between men and women \u00a0which has positive impacts on men and social justice for both genders has made the world a better \u00a0place for men to live and express themselves",

Whenever some one tried to make these laws gender-neutral, the group that opposes them first? FEMINISTS !\n\nIn india more than half of rape cases are false allegations, some year stats show as high as 70% of rape cases being false ! Which group opposes first when someone raises a voice to punish these false accusers? FEMINISTS.\n\nAnd the secret Idea behind feminism is \"to PUSH more and more men to become live-home dads, to PUSH them to be more \"feminine\". Yesterday only, i read a interview of a prominent Feminist. Question was \"what is feminism to you\" \u00a0and her exact words \u00a0\"It means majority of men being live-at-home dads and majority of women working\". It made me sick and hate feminists even more.\n\nThere is actually no bias in job market based <b> on s</b>ex. Even after reserving many jobs for women, those reserved jobs are still lying vacant because there are many fields where majority of women are not INTERESTED ! Like majority of men are not interested in jobs which at present are interesting to women. Feminism is pushing people , just for the sake of 50-50 or even 100:0 into jobs which do not interest the individuals !\n\nFeminism is shaming men, hating them, generalizing them.

And this demeaning documentary questions the same men who stood for the victim. In the documentary maker's own words \" Sick mentalit<b> y of IN</b>DIAN SOCIETY\". A documentary made by feminist.\n\nAnd no feminism has played NO major role in anything good recently, all the they are worried about is being catcalled, Ban \u00a0Bossy, Man spreading, all imaginary wage-gap, \u00a0anti-gamer gate ! This is the real standards of Feminism . Being PROFESSIONAL VICTIM is what feminists do best.\n\nAll the anti-men laws pushed by feminists like dowry law meant to protects women are being over overwhelmingly being used as a weapon against men, and Feminists are happy to ignore it, And you claimed it is doing men good ? the world has become so feminist that whenever an incident happens men are assumed guilty unless proven innocent whereas women enjoy being treated as innocent until proven guilty !\n\nFeminists support equality when and where it is beneficial to them and drop it when it's not, why is there reservation for women in only White collar jobs and not in Blue collar jobs? \u00a0\n\nAnd what rights are Feminists fighting for? In my country India , women have more rights then men do, and i suppose it's the same in western countries. And not to mention all the billion of dollars of welfare schemes women enjoy, and even though men have many many problems, how much do they<b>  get?</b> ZERO dollars !\n\nFeminism has destroyed western world, where more than 50% marriages end up in divorces. Women rake in huge sums of Alimony and 80-90% women gets child custody. less and less men are going to colleges and are willing to get married, and what are feminists doing about it? yeah celebrating and enjoying it.. And Feminists next target is eastern world ! I am happy that more and more people are waking up and seeing the real filthy face of feminis<b> m. but n</b>othing saddens me more than seeing manginas.\u00a0\nThe day feminism is wiped from the face of earth and everyone becomes EGALITARIAN is the day true equality will be achieved.\u00a0\n\nPS: This perfectly egalitarian women's video on which you are commenting hates to be called a Feminist ! You can very well guess why.",

Like EEORA2012, Not Alone, Affirmative Action, $3.1/y Women's Health, VAWA, etc. Let's not forget the biased HeForShe or Man-Up. I see no law that makes women equally responsible for their crimes. So much for the feminist's claim for \"<b> gender </b>equality\"!\nObviously one need not to sit on the driver's seat to also have control.\n\n\"1) Feminism has allowed more women to be in the workforce...\"\n> It was never illegal for women to do so in any of those countries you mentioned.\nOn the flip side, it has made women less happy than ever before, according to a few surveys; increased typical male work related illness for women and shorten the<b>  gender</b> death gap, according to an UK study. Thank your feminism for that.\n\n\"2) Feminists played a major role in ending the stigma associated with HIV patients\"\n> Not sure what you mean.

One that is causing an epidemic fear for something that is relatively rare? One that auto assumes penis=rapist, like the UK Law? One that is causing an epidemic in India and is a concern to Supreme Court and Delhi Commission for women (PS do listen to this video and another from Spain too where some brave judges claim men are being falsely accused to exhort their wealth and health too - even Gramps are publicly protesting it, a 1st in history). One that destroys the Constitutional Right on Due Process in Not Alone and all the subsequent weired laws like the freaky Calf. \"Yes mean Yes\"? Like the Rolling Stones case you mean?\nFeminists rape=rape is a laughable but a dangerous farce too, one that makes women children and auto nails another based on thei<b> r gende</b>r.\u00a0 That's a form <b> of gend</b<b> >er rac</b>ism.\n\n\u00a0\"the FBI's definition of rape now recognizes raping a man as rape.\"\n> and also made it so that penis auto=rapists.

This is akin to Hitlerism. Had feminism succeeded, I would now be charge as a Hate Criminal. As you can see I have little faith in feminism's good intents.\n\n\"5) With the rise of feminism the idea of what it means to be a man has changed immensely...\"\n> Someone wants to define what I should be??? That's supremacy!\nDrugs boys in school to act like girls and cut off their much needed recess, sports, vocational training, etc. In Sweden, cut off the word 'he\" altogether - result a vast incr<b> ease in</b> Gender Dysphoria, non-existent before and acco<b> rdin</b>g to ABC. Tell me, do women really want a femMale, so who will have PMS and testosterone poison then?\n\n\u00a0\"They can be loving fathers,...\"\n> Feminists destroyed family - remember that\n> Tell NOW NY to stop opposing 50/50 Shared Parenthood. Men will save billions in court fees just to see their kids again. Men will also have less health problems and less suicides. That's to say NOW is helping to cause health, wealth problems for men. Tell NOW to oppose non-biologic 'dads' for having to pay child-support or go to jail (QB Supreme Court), to make Paternal Alienation and Paternal Fraud as crimes against children., per UN Human Rights\n\n\"6) Finally without the efforts of women to gain equal rights between men and women...\"\n> Even when women did not have \"equal rights\", law were always meant to protect the precious princesses, ironically feminists blame the <b> \"mythical p</b>atriarchy\" for it. Women were by far better off in the long-run. Their lack of rights in the past were to protect women, to benefit married women, etc.\n\u00a0Also using the same argument what rights do men have nowadays that women don't, aka is feminism then just as redundant as unions?\n\nGreat to see that women too invented things all in the past too, hum! What recent things have women invented thanks to feminism freedom?\n\u00a0Let's face it, most women who are on top positions, don't usually consider themselves as feminists. it makes sense too, given that feminism is all about being a victim, a<b> ka anot</b>her mental block that discourages a winning mentality.\n\n\"...social justice for both genders...\"\n> Sorry but that's a blatant lie!",

Most guys who are just becoming disillusioned with feminism still believe in the \"women were oppressed because they didn't have the same rights as men back then\" bullshit, which COMPLETELY clouds their ability to grasp how their own rights are slowly being TAKEN AWAY under this snake oil salesman pitch of \"equal rights for women\". But you actually have a more accurate account of what is actually going on. Both manginas and bitches fail to realize that rights are RESPONSIBILITIES. Men in general were granted the right to vote, but were also required to sign up for selective service and be drafted whenever the fuck the country decided to go to war. Women weren't, because men wanted to protect them. That's the reason men were motivated to go to war in the first place. Men were encouraged to be in charge of their relationships but were also required to protect and take care of the women and children who followed them. That's where the concept of chivalry came from.\u00a0 But you don't hear\u00a0 this side of the story in <b> faggot </b>women's studies classes. You hear that these societal expectations were put in place to oppress women.\n\nWhich is retarded. Because if men's intentions were to oppress women.....why would they ever stop? If men were all in agreement that women should be oppressed...there would be literally<b>  NOTHING</b> women could do to stop it. So why would men ever stop if they had such evil intentions?.....Every piece of immoral legal ground being given to women are simply that....given to them....by....MEN. They didn't go to war for their rights like truly oppressed men of the past have. Nope. Feminists complained, and they got what they wanted. Like kids whining for candy. That never happens under an oppressive tyrannical rule.\n\nAll you have to do is compare what would happen if you made a hashtag group called KillAllMen in America(people joke about it, you even have MEN coming in to say \"it'z just a joke guyz chill out, they are just venting their frustration\" to defend the cunts spouting nonsense. And cunts who supported it felt completely justified in doing so. BUT most importantly # KILLALLMEN was ALLOWED by men, the so called oppressors.) and a hashtag group called KILLALLKOREANS in North Korea(You'd wind up missing).\n\nWomen aren't oppressed, they're spoiled children who lack discipline.

In today's world, a marriage, especially an arranged one is more of a business arrangement to see who brings what into the whole relationship. I see my friend's parents looking for a men who have a high status and\u00a0particular kind of income and this happens in the highly educated homes as well as the illiterate. A pre-nup is something that should be mandatory. It's always better to chart out what will happen if a marriage fails inside of just entering it blindly and trustfully.\u00a0\nAlso might I add that the women who falsely accuse in rape/dowry are also not doing this on their own. They have a family to back them up or even put these ideas in their heads. Any father/mother gets over-protective about their children and would want the best for them, and in such cases, a few people believe revenge is the answer. So don't make it men vs women issue, because about 95% of the time, the entire family is always involved.",

They just don't seem to get that feminists want to help women gain recognition among society as equal human beings and that feminism is not about killing men. I saw some recent women's rights people standing up for men who are falsely charged. I have my feminist lecturers always warning us rights are not for comfort and misusing it could cause society a threat. most feminists I have met always say equality is not about becoming men or sending men to the status where we were or to beat them up and there are my feminist friends who condemn women who use feminism as a tool to get their things done. i just dont get it when we voice out that we hate violence against men as much as against women no body believes us and instead we are called names just because we happen to be feminists.",

                    "commentText": "@krishna G\u00a0I used feminist again and again cos we are accused of not supporting men's inequality and i needed to accentuate that the idea of men hatred is not propagated by most feminists.Though the amount of women in men's issue are less it will soon grow just like it took centuries for men to support feminism. Men's issues are not as prominent in our society due to our society's biased built up notions that a man is has no emotions and is only an ATM. If we break this idea that men too experience rapes and molestation and other evils in the society, things may be easier to understand. And I didn't suggest MRA group has women I just said feminists and many women do support that laws are biased but the idea given out by some of these groups completely shuns the idea that there are still rapes happening against women. Some of them have gone to the extent of saying rape myth is purely created by feminists. And how do we all assume that all the acquittal cases are false? And all the data showing false cases are true? Just like some feminists and media comfortably tamper the data of rapes and violence against women, people here also might be doing the same knowingly or unknowingly. We all know under pressure ppl take back cases, or sometimes to save the family's reputation, I'm saying this cos in my family I have witnessed three cases where my aunts refused at the last moment the cases of dowry, violence and when they were treated poorly by in laws, just to save the family's reputation, cos they had other sisters/sister or siblings to be married off. I have witnessed abusive women in my family but not more than abusive men, and both the cases simply overlooked cos family's reputation and society.\u00a0\nWe can very clearly see how our ideas are flawed when we only address blatantly violent issues and unconsciously overlook the psychology behind it which is more prominent in society but hardly recognized.\nThings would have been cool if these groups aimed only at the point that men's issues need support rather than insulting those feminists also who are ready support their cause. As I said earlier the second I identify myself a feminist they ask me my <b> sexual </b>orientation, or assume me as a family wrecker, a<b>  woman</b> with no feminine qualities, a man hater and even worse infant killer. I have to mention everywhere that I love kids and men as much as I love women. These are again the stereotypes that \"a feminist can be only some of these\". And believe me i still come across many ppl (men and women) who blame it on the female victim for rape but the second i mention children and men are raped they don't reply.\u00a0\nAnd we can't clearly say all courts and all the judgments are against men,majorly they are against the accused but not all of them. And false cases are serious things to be fought for irrespective of which ism they are part of or thei<b> r gende</b>r but that must not give the ppl the idea that all cases of rape, violence are false. Ppl have fought immensely to fight the cause of rape issues and hence, must be handled with care without revictimizing the victim, (those efforts should not go futile).",

( these are all the realities in this society)\nIf that is the case, how can men point out the issues, he can only point of the wrong accusations, against him that is by women to make his case. that doesn't mean men are not understanding women issues , we do. but, if there is no law that helps men and the increasing number of false accusations are causing men to commit suicide in the marriage.\nyou are saying the MRA is wrongly accusing women\n1.aren't the women who are filling the cases against men and their families ( those people who are in that group, i can assure are the people who suffered by the laws in india.who did gone through, so they may be harsh)\n2.if one group of people say women are bad, how can you assume men are all against women rights. if a women group comes out and say bad about men, we doesn't care.why can't women be understanding what exactly MRA is saying and what they might have gone through in this laws.\n\nlastly,as you said false accuse should be punished and laws should be neutral and help few good men into turning bad.else, marriage rate will go down as it happened in the west, divorce will increase (due to a small fight at that moment ) marriage is gone, children will be taken away from men, his savings and time is gone to shed.",

Like and most of friends do acknowledge, I hope most <b> woman </b>as human beings would not let happen what happened to them centuries back and would start protesting on streets. I always stand by point that anyone can get raped and rape cannot be declared as myth due to false rape charges. :) But by blindly calling all acquittal cases false would be the same what some feminists and media did to gain sympathy. We all are very well aware with wife bashing jokes, girls being<b>  dumb</b> jokes and jokes on o<b> f effeminat</b>e men also harms indirectly. A group which addresses such intricate issues cannot be pointless altogether. there are far more greater causes that feminism stands for than the minute one I mentioned (Jokes) and it was and always had been a unique movement. All it needs is to accentuate now very strongly in public arena the misuse of laws made for the interest if need<b> ed wom</b>an \u00a0and if required must protest and show equal remorse in courts to make the needed amendments. I wish I could do something in public if my institution allowed me, \u00a0till then I would educate my friends about the serious threat the misuse of laws poses. :)",

I cannot mix these same opinions on my fashion blog because it will sound like Vogue's video, one side trying to talk about women's issues and at the same time telling them how to dress up. I can't do double standards.\nAlso it's not just up to urban women to take time off and tend to the rural areas, urban men can do that as well. Also it's not easy, unless you're working with an NGO. This is \u00a0country-wide issue and we have to do it collectively. It's not blaming the government, it's asking them to help and fix the current situation, because that's what they are elected for and that's their job. We all are expected to do our jobs, whatever they are.\nRegarding clothes, when stupid people ask a rape victim what she was wearing, that becomes an issue. To set an example and say \"If I want to parade around naked, doesn't mean I want to be raped\" is trying to tell people (especially men with dirty thoughts) that less clothing doesn't mean a yes. Also, when a <b> woman </b>is beaten up in public, it's unfortunate that her clothes are always torn off, that's because men and women believe that to shame a<b>  woman</b> is to make her stand naked and \"expose\" her to the public. Would also like to remind you, before the British invasion happened, we were all free spirits and patial nudity was no big deal. It was the Brits that shamed our ancestors and made them put on clothes :-)\nIt's surprising how not a lot of people know our own country's history, watch a historic movie and see how the women and men dressed.\u00a0\nLastly, I think it's illegal for a man o<b> r woma</b>n to walk in their undergarments or expose themselves in most parts of the world.

If it's good, it's good, and if it's terrible, that's exactly what it is. The picture in the link I sent you was actually clicked by me. Tourist locations doesn't mean you have to wear underwear on the beach. Swimming trunks are appropriate. Women don't come in their lingerie, but they wear swimwear.\n1. \"Evil men world\" - and who's quote is that? The world and evilness is not bound by <b> gender.</b> The law who is greatly influenced by the government is corrupt in a lot of places and have been taking wrong stances. They decide to ban trivial things like documentaries, a word in a song and beef, but no one wants to ban evil and hate crimes.\n2. How can you be so sure there's no<b>  woman</b> doing anything? Have you personally visited NGOs that help rural people? I have white friends who have traveled from their countries to do service work and lend a helping hand to teach rural women in India and be a part of these organisations. Just because there is no YouTube video to show you this, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.\u00a0\n3. Invasion happened soon after the world wars, thanks for teaching me history. India has rich civilization an<b> d India</b>n women in the Gupta period wore scraps of cloth and beads. Most of them were topless. To know more, look at the statues from the famous caves in India. Women rarely covered the upper part of their body. When the Mughal period kicked in, there was a bit of modesty and Muslim women covered themselves and that's how we have salwar kameez. But even when women wore sarees, they did so without blouses. That changed during the Victorian period.\nYou can read more about it here -\u00a0 [LINK]  (I've particularly studied costume history)\n4.\u00a0We taught them culture but they showed us modesty :-)\u00a0\n5. These are facts that I think everyone knows.\n6. The people from Mahabharata and Ramayana wore exactly what others wore during that same time period. Don't look at TV shows and think they were well dressed. Those are costumes made to suit our modern times. I'm sure they were well dressed, but they were also mostly partially nude. They paid more emphasis to ornaments and jewelry and less to cloth.\n7. No, I'm talking about Indians from India. Our forefathers from centuries ago.\n8. I have no idea what you're talking about. No one is neglecting the state or plight of rural people or forgetting about anti-men laws. You probably just watched this video that spoke about those things particularly, and by<b>  a wom</b>an.",

Like in very<b>  old</b<b> > ag</b>e , when we were in caves, men had in general three roles to play: As a bread winner, protector and a sperm donor.But in present society as women started getting their own bread, so we lost the first job. Then with the adequate police and judiciary system our second job is not in our primary priority. So at present we left with only sperm donor and no doubt that we are confused our uses in a social system. <b> so gend</b>er equality.

It seems natural for <b> a woma</b>n to be caring and nurturing and weaker than her male counterparts. But there are exceptions and bullying those who do not fit into yo<b> ur gend</b>er stereotypes is plain wrong. This led to a lot of people (women who were manly and wanted to break out of the womanly stereotypes and men who wanted to be nurses and were sensitive) to feel bullied and led to most of them felling depressed and eventually killing themselves. So you can't really say that it's \"natural behavior\" when it clearly has been inculcated over time by society. God might have intended us to be this way, but since we're all human here. Tomorrow if you have a son and if he is bullied because he likes to wear a dress, which seems unnatural for a boy, he would probably kill himself, and I don't think you would like that.

In-justice against men does happen in more educated societies at times when some women take feminism to the level of actually thinking they are better than men because you know ovaries, and birth and giving new life, while simply forgetting to realize that a man is need to do those things as well. Like what good is that womb, when there's no seed?\nBut let's not forget, this happens even in mediocre education backgrounds. Most <b> gender </b>biased crimes are taken advantage of in these settings. I've always read about how middle class or lower class young women or even their entire families have falsely accused a man of a rape charge when he refuses to marry the girl because they don't know any better and cannot simply comprehend how they are messing with a person's life. The only agenda in their mind is revenge and that's a frightening thing. Per-marital<b>  sex</b> is a prett<b> y commo</b>n thing and while most Indians fail to acknowledge this and get uncomfortable talking about it, the false rape charges take place, because it's very easy for<b>  a wom</b>an who was consensual at that time, to accuse the man much later saying it was against her wishes.\u00a0\nAn example - I read an article in a Goan newspaper when I was there and I sa<b> w a wo</b>man accused a man of raping her. The article also talked about how they met on a dating site and she traveled from Mumbai to Goa to meet him and spend time with him and when he refused to commit or marry her, she filed a case!",

More than the<b>  gender</b> roles themselves, I think the real problem is the stigma which we attach to them. A lot o<b> f India</b>n men subscribe to the stupid principle of \"I make the money, therefore I make the decisions.\"\nNonsense. Taking care of a household, nurturing a family and providing them with three solid meals a day is, to me, just as important as bringing home the bacon. There is NO SHAME in running a kitchen. \"The kitchen\" is coming to be seen as a symbol of oppression by many radical feminists. In some cases this is understandable, I suppose, especially if t<b> he wom</b>an would rather have a career than take care of the household. But some radicals would say the only definition of a successful and str<b> ong wo</b>man is one who is financially independent. That is, money = power, prestige, sand self-respect. Ironically, in doing so, they are subscribing to the same idiotic policy as that of the men they condemn! The best way to prevent this rift from forming between the two sexes is simplicity itself: respect what the other person does, and know that it's every bit as important as what you do.",

My mother is a housewife and still spends most of her time being the amazing homemaker that she is. But she was fortunate enough to have the option to pick this life for herself. She wanted to stay home and take care of my sister and myself and was not influenced by her parents or in laws. And I can't even be bothered to clean my room well, let alone an entire house. And I really hope every women gets these same privileges. Some women want to cook for their husbands and slave in there, but as long as they want to, it shouldn't be anyone's business.\nA random guy argued with me once saying that all feminism was doing was trying to break families by telling women they need to do go to clubs and drink and not cook for their husbands.

I've worked on a few movies, and I've noticed that women on set (not counting the ones acting in the movies, but the actual crew who work behind the scenes) are very less.

If they can afford, they will surely send girl child as well. But if they can afford only one or hardly one, they will send boy child and you urself would've done so because parents too want to secure their future of<b>  old</b<b> > ag</b>e and Why shouldn't they...? It is duty of son to take care of parents from \"archaic times\" which you somehow seem to hate or dislike....... Anyway thats completely different thing.\n\nApply same logic to your Maid's children and her neighbours as well. At this time/century, everybody, even people from remote areas have understood importance of education, so they try their best to send all their children to school/college. Now if you still say that people prefer to send boy child than girl, you are pointing their \"Economic Inabiity\". \n\nAbout parents forcing their girl child to learn cooking.....Again Economic condition comes in picture. Do you see same thing in rich families...? Best, take example of yourself.\n\nMarriage is like secuing job, the more you are qualified, better one you get. So, if girl is not educated, she must atleast be good at cooking and other things......\nSimilarly, if boy is not well educated and employed, his family is expected to have good amount of wealth, to get better brid ;)\n\nBoth bride and groom has to struggle and upgrade their CV for better partner or in some cases to just find a girl LOL, and parents are helping them by enforcing things to do it :D\n\nWhen u Speak about equality, Please consider all factors\n\nBadnaam mat karo desh ko aadha sach batake, pehle hi media bahot acchi image bana chuki hai desh ki \"Rape centre of World\"",

Let me tell you that I m talking about the third wave feminists(those who want the right to roam naked in public..LOL).

Feminism on a global stage is branded as equality among genders, but it fights only for women. Equal opportunities, equal pay, equal literacy and so on. Why? Because on the scale of majority of oppression in basics, men don't feature. When it comes to the <b> sex </b>ratio, literacy, average pay, involvement in jobs, and such in India, the number of women is all less than men. In fact, pathetically less. So yes, women fight for other women. But it doesn't mean they have to hate men for it. Yes, men are being oppressed by rules meant to secure women; but it's honestly such a small number and started in recent times, so it hasn't even found its voice yet. \n\nAs someone once said, \"When men are tortured, it is oppression, but when women are tortured, it is only culture.\" So look how easy it is for everybody to blame the constitution and ask it to be mended so that men aren't oppressed. But it's not half as easy to ask to change the culture that oppresses women. Because culture is not on paper, it is ingrained. It's harder to change, so it has more supporters. Now if someone fighting for men's rights finds that unfair, I'm sorry. \n\nHow about one of you first support those against the legalization of marital rape which has been in the constitution for ages? \n\nFeminism fights for women, but it doesn't mean women need to trample over men and get ahead. It asks for equality. And when women become equal to men, it's egalitarianism too. \n\nBetter not stereotype an entire group of society as evil who want women ahead of men. And even if you do, good job,<b>  nobody</b> cares. There is no good without evil, after all.",

That movement is valid only till 2nd wave feminism, where females got the same rights as men.\n\nThere is NO NEED for feminism anymore in countries which have equal rights for all genders. Hell, in most counties including USA and India, laws favour men more than women.......feminism is redundant now.\n\nThe Feminism right now is 3rd wave feminism, whose members are autistic retards who wants special right for women and want oppression of men and THEY have to stop.\nThis 3rd wave feminism have taken away parental rights away from men in US and made laws passed in India which states that it's impossible for men to get raped, and hence men can't be rape victims.",

I am very well aware of Deepika and Jyoti and th<b> e India</b>n MRM and that famous dialogue between Paul and Anil Kumar. I have been following Karen Straughan, John TheOther's videos and stuff for quite sometime. I have known you since that pathetic East India Comedy video of manginas surfaced.

But the thing is that people don't realize that all this rape hysteria and all t<b> he femina</b>zi bullshit is intentional...Its on UN Women's agenda...its merely a depopulation agenda by systematic breakdown of the family unit and the institution of marriage under the guise of breaking down t<b> he \"patriar</b>chy\". (Hence you see the mainstream media is deliberately seeking even the most ludicrous cases of \u00a0CAW and doesn't give a fuck about the gross atrocities on the other half). Its almost complete in the first world and now India is half way through. I don't see any significant reform coming in<b>  the ge</b>nder laws in India anywhere in the near future. The campaigning might well go on , I won't hinder it, but I am active on the internet and simply can't waste energy on fighting - well that's my personal choice. Secondly what we Mgtows know is that feminism is merely a temporary phase, the real enemy is gynocentrism and marriage as an institution (both secular state contract and religious contract) exists under its canopy. The solution is not returning to the TradCon mode either.\u00a0\nYes, you are right, the moment a person with a stick between the two legs even dares to mildly criticize the Golden Vagina, it is a norm that he will be pounced upon by ferocious howling wolves and chewed up alive - what can we do - this gynoc<b> ratic n</b>atio<b> n is a Fe</b>miNazi shithole !!!!",

Like any other social norm marriage made sense in early human society and was re-enforced by religion since religion used to intervene in every personal aspect of people's lives. Marriage causes more harm than benefit today. Secondly if you look into existing apes i.e. tailless primates literally none of them are monogamous whether male or female. Alpha male's primal function was to be big and strong and function as the chief protector of his group. Those paradigms have shifted in human beings since power doesn't depend on natural assets anymore. Power is fluid because of the invention of money. Anyone with enough money and or intellectual influence can become powerful in human society irrespective of their physical size. Humans are also polygamous like other apes. The purpose of marriage was to ensure happiness by clamping down on having multiple <b> sexual </b>partners and complicating people's lives. Today in the West that purpose has eroded. Women frequently divorce and men are on the receiving end. Though a little less frequent, an<b>  Indian</b> male divorc\u00e9e is treated much worse than his western male counterpart. Therefore the institution of marriage holds no relevance today. Not that it is bad or whatever. Just that there is no point. And it causes more harm and complications than any good in the modern world.",

Make paternity fraud punishable. Fathers for ustice, etc too are there. In older times cheating women were burned, stoned to death and drowned so, a law is possible not as severe physically though.\nIn US there are some no fault states and much complicated as compared to India. As for my alpha quote, definition of alpha has changed so your beta may be my alpha. I never said alpha get all women, some like you and me have morals too.\nLaws are requied because marriage is connected not to just physical or emotional aspect but as well as financial aspect so society has to, at some extent interfere. As west is concerned I agree laws are favourable for cheaters but not in India if families are involved because you can screw your spouse but not your family, there are societial consequences for doing so which acts as deterrent.",

                    "commentText": "@Camran Manikfan\u00a0There's no need for such a law where a man needs to prove his innocence before court in India, because right at the investigation level the law presumes man to be guilty until proven innocent which goes against the very spirit of <b> Indian </b>judiciary and how it was established. There is virtually<b>  nothing</b> and I mea<b> n nothin</b>g you can do to prove your innocence in rape cases in India. Let me emphasi<b> ze nothi</b><b> ng, z</b><b> ero, z</b>ilch, nada. No way in hell are you winning the case. When it come<b> s to \"g</b>ender\" related crimes and family courts in India EVIDENCE DOES NOT MATTER. You can show all the evidence you want. The judgement cannot and will not be in your favour. It is a very complex thing to explain and a subject of another discussion so let's just leave that there.\n\nMen don't just go to jail for one-night stands here (whi<b> ch the </b>Indian law calls promise-of-marriage which is just... lol). Men go to jail after living in with someone for years.<b>  If th</b>e woman sees something isn't working out for her and goes and complains to the cops. Not only <b> does t</b>he woman cry rape because it works in her favour legally, but the law treats the case as kidnap and constant rapes for say 5 years, if \u00a0say your relationship<b>  with </b>the woman was of 5 years.\n\nHowever I understand your point about UK. You're saying that it is being coded in the law that a one-night stand can be deemed as rape. And that isn't good for anybody. Because as soon as that happ<b> ens in </b>UK, Indian feminazis are going to rush in to copy it.\n\nOne advantage that India has is that the rise of Men's Movement here was fairly timely. Misandric bills had a history of becoming laws in India and going unchallenged. When MRM burst into the scene some 10 years ago in its primitive stage, we didn't have a fast internet connection to vent out our anger on YouTube. So we started concentrating on laws and activism. It has begun fruition these days.\n\nOnly recently protests from MRAs prevented the passing of a bill called Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage or IrBM. The bill proposed that in the wake of a divorce the wife was to get 50% of the husbands property and upto 25% of the Father-in-Laws property no questions asked. MRAs took to the streets, flooded the social media and most importantly started meeting<b>  Member</b>s of Indian Parliament (MPs). (The terms used here are identical to that in British politics). But not just that we ran a detailed SMS and e-Mailing campaign against the bill. We were covering the discussion live on Facebook and Twitter which the bill was under actual discussion in the Upper House, Rajya Sabha (analogous to House of the Lords).\n\nWe did so because unlike feminists we didn't hav<b> e a </b>100 year old or any lobby inside the Parliament. So we were forced to lead the offence from outside. We took to the streets. Hell I was there too. Had me a Megaphone and everything. We picketed outside the Parliament constantly. And now the bill has begun to be retracted.\n\nThe thing here is, we have devised a way to systematically challenge specific laws that were previously going unchallenged. No one in the world<b>  can sa</b>y that Indian MRAs don't do anything except express anger on the internet. Such allegations are commonplace against MRAs in the USA and Canada<b>  by fem</b>inists. Indian feminists are really confused by th<b> e appea</b>rance of Indian MRAs because they had been playing dirty and making a lot of money from international aid for far too long. Now a community is after them to expose them, and they were simply not ready. We aren't one organization in India. We are several organizations like in Western countries. But we know how to set an agenda.\n\nWe won't allow any money hungry greedy bitch organization to declare our country the rape capital of the world, just so they can make money. And that too on falsified and exaggerated data. <b> Anger i</b>s real in Indian MRM.\n\nI was in college when I came to MRM. We have strict laws against student organizations in India because of a history of politically motivated Socialist student unions that caused more disruption than productivity in the past. No college wants organizations within itself in India. Especially private colleges. I couldn't organize and mobilize people in my college therefore. But the very fact that I existed, was vocal about men's issues and publicly challenged feminist ideas in all walks of life people knew me. Online activism on Facebook also helped. So the college was introduced to Men's Movement during my time. Now the new kids know what it is.\n\nThese kinds of social changes put feminists in a fix. That's why things are looking good for future in India. Admittedly the picture isn't very good today. But we are hoping to change that. The role of Western MRAs becomes ver<b> y impor</b>tant then. Indian feminazis are copying the idiots from your countries. If you take them down legally and socially following a due process, it's good for the whole world. You guys have immense power in your hands.",

However, they should not interfere with MGTOW but complement it.\n\nMGTOW in general, can afford to take a more distant approach, but both groups should learn from the hive of feminism how to be cohesive. I know, MGTOW could care less, well that is true for now, but there are no guarantees for the future. Examples, a bachelor tax would require an organized group to fight it (it already happened).\nThe most extreme example (still doing some research about it), was back in 20s in Ukraine where all a <b> woman </b>had to do was send a registered letter to any man, and by law he was legally married to her and pay her support. The divorce rates were close to 100% and many<b>  woman</b> became rich in the process. Don't yet quote me on this cause I'm still doing research on it.",

Of course the retards who know <b> nothing </b>about India, think they can identify what is wrong with the society without EVER learning anything about it.\nDowry was female inheritance. They banned dowry and then daughters realized that the then-existing inheritance laws kept them out, so those laws needed to be changed as well. Irony is that dowry is still voluntary, always was. It is a good thing that these social \"reformers\" did not realize that people kill others to gain things. And killing is already illegal. But can you imagine these retards coming up with \"thou shalt not have anything\" because you might kill someone for it. I know I can.",

I have to thank Deepika for enlightening me on this issue as I have fallen trap to the thinking of how women have it worse in India than men (media outlets regurgitate this). I feel extremely bad for the men and their families who have had to go through such an ordeal and may those who have committed suicide rest in peace (although it doesn't offer much help). I support any human being who has actually been wronged in their fight for justice. I am disappointed that so many women have misused the law.

I had to make a wide turn that almost made me to slip plus making the car behind me to crash into me. Wen I handled myself and asked the ladies to use footpath and not the road for chitchatting, they started scolding and abusing loud on the road attracting too many ppl against me.\n\nI was in a local train standing at the door with my college mates when at one station a lady constable arrived in and stood right between us at the door. 2 of my friends left the place and went in. I was standing way behind her. Unnoticeably with the wind few of her hair blew and got caught into my grip holding the roof of door. Wen she moved, she significantly felt the pull and turned to me with rage and got back. I was lucky not to get slapped or been taken to police station.\n<b> \nGender</b> inequality is not or at least alone an issue of women now.

It's like suicide. And we have statistics all over the place. People should open their eyes. I agree with you that men should boycott marriage, till all these anti-male laws are banished, and we have real equality. Sadly, India has always been a matriarchal society. We even say 'bharat mata' and not 'bharat pita', inspite of the fact \u00a0 pita is the one working his ass off providing for the family, and only he get's fucked if something goes wrong. Infact, it has gone to such an extent, that you don't even need to be married to get fucked by 1 false allegation. And since the society has always been biased(had a soft corner) towards women, any allegation is automatically assumed to be true WITHOUT ANY PROOF. And the accused is thrown in jail, WITHOUT ANY PROOF, but only for 1 'allegation'. That's really barbaric man. It's slavery. Marriage is slavery for men, <b> nothing </b>else. Today, marriage has<b>  zero</b> benefits for men. It's like legal extortion women and the government use against men, to transfer their cash to the women. Like Deepika said, you say 'Hi' to <b> a woma</b>n, she can accuse you of harassment.<b>  A wom</b>an doesn't get a promotion, she'll accuse the boss<b>  of sex</b>ual harassment or even rape, and that will fuck his life up. Even when all these cases are proven false, these vindictive women criminals don't receive any punishment. It's sad being oppressed like this in a gynocentric world today.",

I am all for women and their issues but I don't hold men responsible for it. Feminists advocate about how men should change their behavior and attitude but completely ignores the fact that females too need to change as much if not more. Females are equally flawed too. I guess I have said enough. How would you people like it when I start a counter theory and blame women for all the suffering men had through out history? That's the bigotry.

Are you telling me that the men who call themselves feminists and fight for equal rights hate themselves and other men? The only thing to hate here is society and how it's made us think. We have all been brought up with values where a <b> woman </b>was always the weaker<b>  sex</b> and had a different role in a family. Initially when women had absolutely no rights, that's when the feminism movement began, so that women could go to school and for suffrage so that <b> a woma</b>n even had the right to vote. And that's why it was called FEM-inism. Soon it because a movement for equal rights, for not only women, but also men. While at the same time, some fanatics took it to the extreme. They started hating men for the way they were being treated, because it seemed men slowed them down and didn't allow them to progress. But these fanatics didn't realize that it was not only men but women who were doing that as well. And these women are just not true feminists.\nAnd you got that so wrong. Why the fuck would we hate men? I personally want to find a nice man who I'll spend the rest of my life with. It's ridiculous to assume that feminism = man-hating just because some idiots have done this in the past (or still do). The only reason we would even think of hating a particular man is if he would disrespect<b>  a wom</b>an and her choices .As a feminist I see and I understand what everyone is going through. Things need to change for both men and women. Women (especially in India) need equal opportunities and a safer environment but at the same time should not be given any extra or special treatment for just bein<b> g a wo</b>man. And same with man. <b> If a w</b>oman falsely accuses him of anything, she needs to bear the consequences.\u00a0\nHere's some fun light reading about exchanges between a few ignorant men with a feminist on a dating app -\u00a0 [LINK] ",

Imagine a farmers family , now guess who is going to plough fields and who is going to cook. Pretty obvious. But wait , before you shout o<b> ut gend</b>er roles are social construct and women can be physically as strong as men, then bring equality in sports where females don't play against males. Plays for shorter durations and gets equal prize money and rank. There's so much on the other side of the perspective which you might have not imagined.

Some women have more strength than so many men, it's all at an individual level.\nYes there have been a few women scholars and pioneers, but just because they got the chance, doesn't mean all women had the same. The first women's school in India was started around the mid 1800s where as we all know that India is regarded as one of the pioneering countries and had the school system along with the ancient Greeks and Romans. What were women doing during that huge gap?\u00a0\nWhen education to women was made available, still the literacy rate of girls was not even 10% as compared to the men. Thankfully we have moved on, and now the literacy rate is between 60-85% and differs from each region. And we need to keep encouraging everyone to move on. If a <b> woman </b>wants to remain in the kitchen, that's her choice, but she should not be forced by family and in-laws to do the same.\nBecause of physique and build, it's impossible for men and women to compete together in sports. But when I was in the 9th standard, I took part in a small scale football tournament and I was the only girl who played. I was welcomed by everyone. Some boys thought they had to \"play nice\" since I was a girl and would get hurt easily, and the same men were embarrassed later on when they all lost to a team that had a girl. School can be tough, imagine how insane it will be in real life? Women complaining that men are stronger if they have to run a<b>  race</b> together especially if they lose tha<b> t rac</b>e, or men simply avoiding it so as to not having the change or misfortune to be beaten by a girl, since we still haven't gotten rid <b> of gend</b>er biased stereotypes and roles yet.",

And the poor <b> woman </b>take the offer reluctantly; then over a period of time convince herself that the madeup story is true.. and start living as if its actually true... and then fight.\n\nThis misuse is designed and planted by the lawyers who systematically push the women to complete a templated complaint/case. Its the lawyers who is making the mockery of the law and the parties involved. I think its a fight against these pseudo valueless lawyers - and men and women should together fight it.",

Laws existing to protect women will not be changed or revoked. The dangerous messages and false tears in your speech will haunt many a souls of women who were murdered due to dowry harassment and domestic violence. Women of India have come a long way and still experience 99 percent of domestic violence issues. For a mere one percent men, laws cannot be changed. I hope you will give more public speeches, in male clothing, so you stand out as the real you. It is very clear that you are an urban women and never seen or experienced the life of true rural women. Getting brainwashed by few incidents is easy. Women who hadn't seen much life can be easily brainwashed and wooed by expensive urban clothing, expensive pearls etc. They love a privileged life and speak for those paisas falling in their purses. Because in India, still most of the property is owned and held by men, they do have lot of financial resource to hire men and women who will speak for their interests. But those who work for downtrodden and raped women like Sunitha Krishnan,  [LINK] \u00a0 is finding it hard to raise money to give food and shelter to the victims. Men hold a large amount of money and power and they are not willing to donate money to protect rape victims. They just prefer to donate to Men's Right Groups so they can woo girls like you with expensive jewelry and fashionable clothing, so they can pour water on every efforts done by the invisible <b> gender </b>(women) and create laws that only favor male domination. I hope some day you will understand the fact that men who own most of the money and property in India, are just using you to make their lives perfect while not bothering about the appalling levels of poverty and<b>  sex</b> trafficking.",

MRA groups are the richest organizations. Most men facing fake cases are filthy rich men who give no fuck about <b> a woma</b>n or respect<b>  a wom</b>an. They just wanted to get a law that protects their assets in a marriage or divorce. They are largely the\u00a0men who don't want to pay compensation for the abuse they showered on their wives.

Why don't you step up your social work for them.

Now the marriage was unhappy with the <b> woman </b>facing dowry demands and domestic violence. So she sought peace and happiness outside marriage. Even according to our esteemed supreme court, an affair outside marriage cannot be considered marital cruelty. It may be wrong but not cruelty. But Dowry demands and Domestic violence are cruelty. Men are\u00a0more physically aggressive<b>  gender</b> Most convicted murderers are men, they engage in physical violence most. Apparently th<b> e woma</b>n was beaten up when the affair came out, so she had to seek help of the law. Please understand that I am not supporting the affair. It was wrong but not cruelty. But she indeed faced violence and that is why the case was in the court. Also please notice that wicked smile and drool at 4:25 of the video.",

Why dont you open \"Begging Centres\" ...that way it wud be clear to men you are after their money. And u know what....what u just spoke about my relative...i have no words for you. I have every evidence of that case but YOU don't deserve an explanation. How much money did you EXTORT from your husband? How many people did you name in your false dowry case by the way? Molestation saath mein lagaya ke nahi father in law par? Pkease do it. You would get compensated in crores then. That's the way women like you plan to bridge the property ownership difference no? Go ask your working women what property they bought after 10 yrs of work and id they did not whose mistake is it?  I am beautiful. I am bold. I am in your face. Not a troll like you who has no existence and no \"VAGINA\" ( let's be truly equal so din use balls) to show your real face. Come talk to me with your real self <b> bimbo.</b> If you hate men so much WHY marry? Why go under someone? Rear his child and then ask for alms in cute name of maintenance? Have you left your father? Why not? Leave him he is a monster.  Create your own world. Be a<b>  lesbian</b>. Have your property and bask away in glory.

And you ask women to slog away their lives. You have a love for designer clothing, which you can get a little cheaper if a <b> woman </b>stitched it than a man, because women are paid less.\u00a0Probably you hate your mother, and it seems you carry a hatred towards women who are capable of giving birth to children. I believe you have no children.\n\nApparently you must be very wealthy now, as evident from your dress code. You are well paid, well fed and well driven\u00a0by the MRAs for everything you do for them. BTW supreme court passed that judgment about the affair in favor of a man who had an affair outside marriage, but by constitution this judgment is applicable to women too.\u00a0So you are well off.\n\nIf men want asset protection laws they don't have to frame that all women are filing fake cases against husbands. Not all DV cases are fake as MRAs claim. They offer protection to violent criminals and pump money to their lawyers in the name of brotherhood and\u00a0\u00a0498A. They are working toward increasing violence against women and to protect perpetrators. You are a sad case where women prove to be women's enemy. I wish you a grant life and more vacations in future with all the money you receive even without begging from the MRAs with your cute expressions and lovely clothes and a willing mind to babble for them. That is not begging at all, That is real work, but prostitution is more dignified.\u00a0\n\nMany countries have better asset protection laws in marriages. Men's groups should work for such laws but not by hurting a domestic violence victim by framing her as fake case filer. Or better, why should men get married if what they love is their money. Women like you are always there.",

This abuse of legal support endangers so many genuinely suffering women apart from terrorizing husbands. All who complain will be seen with a suspicious eye. Crooked lawyers will pounce like wolves and take a cut of the award even if a genuine victim wins a case.\nWhat we need is an equitable law. Something that neutralizes power of one group or <b> gender </b>over another. Not merely transfers the power equation.\nWhy not protect the name of the husband also to first reduce social stress on potential non-offenders?\nWhy not instantly verify cash withdrawals or transfer details to weigh the grounds of the case and grade the severity?\nWhy not check for evidence of obvious physical abuse and grade the case as clear or unclear?\nWhy not petition media houses to show how much we hate eyeball grabbing news at the cost of justice?",

There is absolutely no evidence to show that feminism is about equality of <b> gender </b>except for text book theories and women's studies masquandering as<b>  gender</b> studies. The very fact tha<b> t gende</b>r studies implies women's studies and feminist lies shows that feminism is not about equality. If it was so, there would have been studies about men too. T<b> he gend</b>er discourse if dominated by women and men are not allowed to open their mouths. It shows what feminism is upto. On the other hand, there is ample proof that feminism is about female supremacy. The effects of feminism on men is already felt worldwide and men are losing their human rights, committing suicide, losing their confidence and more. Shame on feminists who can't stop lying. You can't fool the world by saying that feminism is about equality. If you indeed stood for that, we would never need to be here in the first place because you yourself would not allow anti-male laws. Rather you support all anti-male laws and policies actively and then claim that feminism is about equality. Its like the Alquaida and Lashkar groups placing bombs and killing people and then claiming to stand for peace. LOL",

                    "commentText": "Women have suffered enough, still are suffering just look at nayana pujari case, nirbhaya case etc. just because some laws are misused sometimes in sparingly rare cases does not mean they should be repealed, laws are misused worldwide; we need to cleanse and make sure there's proper implementation rather than repealing these laws. \nAnd excuse me lady, get your facts checked - when you talk about women you have to give 'evidence'; don't trot around saying 'when you talk about men you have to give evidence' and make such baseless, futile and ignorant statements. If that were the case the accused in Jessica Lal case, Priyadarshini Mattoo case, Ruchika Girhotra Case, Riju Bafna case all would be convicted/acquitted at the first instance without even recording/examining/assailing evidence which has NOT been the case at all. To make such statements would be making a mockery of the Judiciary and Democracy. Take a look at  [LINK]  for true statistics. \nAlso, Section 2 (q) of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005 has been made <b> gender </b>neutral as recently adjudicated by the Supreme Court i.e. by Justices Kurian Joseph, Rohinton Nariman in Hiral Hirsora v Kusum Hirsora in Civil Appeal 10084 of 2016 decided on 6th October, 2016. Be very careful while quoting examples as the law is ever dynamic and always evolving, don't make wrong and misleading statements just because you have a platform and a mike in your hand.\nI'm all for<b>  gender</b> neutral laws and punishments to be levied in case of false complaints but while making sweeping statements like<b>  'h</b<b> >o </b<b> >ho</b> ho, women's issues don't require evidence' don't be condescending and don't be stupid. In a democracy all offences in order to be proved or disproved require evidence and a proper trial. \nAlso, we are conveniently forgetting that MARITAL RAPE is still not a crime in India, as was held even in Britain in R v R (1991) in fact the current law ALLOWS marital rape. Section 375 of<b>  the In</b>dian Penal Code, 1<b> 860 -'S</b>exual intercou<b> rse or </b>sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen y<b> ears</b> of age, is not rape.' India has the world's highest number of early marriages and while fewer girls younger than 15 are being married (18.2 percent), the rates for girls ages 15-18 has increased to 29.2 percent. Waiting a year eliminates 'rape.'\nThe guidelines on preve<b> ntion o</b>f sexual harassment of women at the workplace were laid down by the Supreme Court in 1997 (yes that's right, in '97 after 50 years of INDEPENDENCE there were no laws in place to protect w<b> omen fr</b>om sexual harassment at workplace) in Vishakha and Ors. v State of Rajasthan (read about the case here- [LINK]  ;  [LINK]  and the law<b>  i.e.  </b>The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 regarding the same was laid down in 2013 (AFTER 16 goddamn years). \nNot to forget men constantly shoving, pushing, groping, ogling, pinching parts, leering us everywhere and anywhere right from the streets to railway platforms to buses to workplaces. According to the National Crime Records Bureau 2013 annual report, 24,923 rape cases were reported across India in 2012. Out of these, 24,470 were committed by someone known to the victim (98% of the cases). Fight for issues faced by women as well then, i<b> f you'r</b>e so gender neutral also, update your facts and figures.\nJust because you have a stage and a microphone you do not have the right to stand there and mock women's rights and issues. Check your privilege AND your facts before you open your mouth anywhere.",

Reality is a <b> woman'</b>s psyche works in a very self - centered and subjective way. \nWhen some one from your own relatives got affected then you had a wake up call. You even said that women are also suffering from this law. That is where your main concern lies. When women are themselves affected then only they care. You said-\" We need more and more protective laws for women and there should be more of them but not ones which could be misused.\" What about the protection of men in other cases when women related to those men are not affected? If any of your cases would have a man having no<b>  woman</b> - sister, wife, mother any, let say if he is unfortunate enough to be an orphan then what? For you then it would be okay right? Men who work in coal mines and other haphazard occupations what about them? \nI saw one case where a man's limbs were amputated he was divorced and forced to pay alimony. Of course he couldn't earn so he would be sent to jain from time to time. So that man is begging for charity and donation so that he can pay alimony to his fully capable wife. You women are mean and pathetic. <b> A woma</b>n caring for a cause is a facade. Look closely and she could have her own vested interest in that cause.",

One really needs lots of guts to say something like this where most of PPL blindly support Women empowerment and growing uncontrolled feminism.. great efforts to bring out the truth which is hidden ... the reality which is unseen.

You notice their ONLY rebuttal against Manhood Academy's debate challenge is \"you're a bad person THEREFORE your debate challenge is invalid!\" They can never say ANYTHING against what Manhood Academy teaches, but they always have a thousand things to say about how bad they are. The MRA version of debating goes like this: \"If we can DEMONIZE the MESSENGER, then we no longer have to be held accountable to the message\". Now they feel self-righteously justified whenever they CENSOR any critical views of their childish movement and BAN dissenters from the discussion. If all they ever have to do is say, \"Manhood Academy is ADOLF HITLER!!!!!!,\" they no longer have to give a valid justification for censorship. They can act like hypocrites with total impunity as far as they're concerned. This is why Karen Straughan is so frightened of debating Manhood Academy while simultaneously claiming she is soooo brave when it comes to debating feminists. She feels morally justified in mocking feminists who are unwilling to debate her and are using the same \"Demonize The Messenger\" tactic that she herself uses against Manhood Academy. She's so fucking stupid and self-absorbed that she doesn't even see the obvious blatant contradiction in her behavior.\n\nThe real test to see if MRAs are full of shit is whether or not they would make these exact same false accusations to Manhood Academy IN PERSON in a LIVE UNCENSORED DEBATE. I think we all know the answer to that! :)\u00a0\n\nSo go ahead and brag about how Manhood Academy wouldn't debate you. We all know you are a full of shit. Manhood Academy has a long track record of NEVER backing down from any critic. MRAs can't say the same LOL! :)\n\nNow make another scared little bitch accusation about \"trolls\", \"spam\" or \"sock puppets\" so we can ALL LAUGH AT YOUR UTTER COWARDICE LOLOL! :) U MAD?",

He can even lose his life, through the actions of vigilante justice.\nWhat would be an appropriate sentence for such a false accuser?\n(The only sensible action is to extend such \"rape shield\" laws to both accuser and accused, with publication of the guilty party only after sentencing.)",

People who are in crisis can often cope better and gain hope just with the understanding that they are not alone, that other people have gone through what they've gone through, and that someone out there recognizes their pain. \n\nJust realizing other people see the injustice can help.
