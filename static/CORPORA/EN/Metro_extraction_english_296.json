        "postText": "A lesbian couple have been targeted in their own home by a hateful neighbour who sent them a letter saying their relationship was \u2018immoral and wrong\u2019.', 'Vikki Parkey, 36, and her wife Stephanie, 29, were left shocked after the anonymous note posted through their letter box told them to move to \u2018a more appropriate area\u2019 of Hull.', 'The married couple, who live in Chestnut Avenue with their 18-month-old daughter, said they could not believe the letter went as far to suggest they had no right bringing up a child as lesbians.', 'The letter read: \u2018We, the residents, are not happy with same-sex couples living our area.', '\u2018Especially not when bringing up a child. It is immoral and wrong. We suggest you move to a more appropriate area osaf the city.\u2019', 'Vikki said: \u2018We\u2019ve lived here at the property for six years and never received anything like this. We just couldn\u2019t believe it. It was very hurtful, but this is just one a***hole, well hopefully, just one a***hole, who is doing this.\u2019', 'The computer-typed letter is thought to have been posted to their two-bed terraced home under the cover of darkness on Thursday evening.', '\u2018I went downstairs this morning and my wife was in tears about it and when I asked her what was up she showed me this letter,\u2019 Vikki said.', '\u2018When I read it, I instantly became mad more than anything for upsetting my wife and thinking that they have any right to pass judgement on us and most of all that they thought they had a right to even mention my daughter.', '\u2018It\u2019s two different emotions really: mad at the bigotry of it all and upset that there was nothing I could do to stop Steph being upset about it.', '\u2018We have never had a problem before, but these opinions in this day and age are just not acceptable. Whoever sent it are just cowards really.\u2019', 'Vikki says she knows her immediate neighbours are friendly so it must have been another resident who lives nearby.', 'She added: \u2018When we were going through IVF, all the neighbours were all really excited for us so we know it\u2019s not the street as a whole.', '\u2018It came through overnight so they must have waited for the lights to go out before posting it. We then saw the letter when we got up for work.\u2019', 'Vikki discovered the letter on Friday morning and reported the incident to Humberside Police straight away.",
