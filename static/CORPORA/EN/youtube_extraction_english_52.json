Take male adult actors and male models for example, some of them model and act full time but make very little money and some of them go into debt. But do you see us \"entitles\" \"mysoganistic\" males complaining about that? No because in general we are not f*cking stupid and realise that there is no marketplace for males in these fields.

The owners of these teams dump millions into their players because their players bring in millions in return, they want to seperate cheerleaders from the players because often there are scandals (false rape accusations, assult, personal life problems etc..) between players and the cheerleaders which can cost the company millions upon millions of dollars so what they do is they setup policies that state if you want to work for me, you have to follow by my rules and if you don't wanna follow my rules then you are free to work somewhere else.",

This means providing policies and rules that employees are made aware of before agreeing to join the company. I see these policies as fair because society doesn't generally view cheerleaders as wh^res where as society DOES see a girl in lingere (yes it's lingere) with a grin on her face as a wh^re which in turn makes the company look bad. My suggestion to anyone who think this policy should change is that they should start THEIR OWN multi-billion dollar company and then they can let their employees do whatever they want, hell even go out naked in public if they wanted to, it's their company and they can do whatever they want with it. This is one of the beauties of the free market, if consumers don't like a company for their policies, they will boycott that company and they will lose money. However, most rational people see through this cheerleaders bs (she just wants money for free and doesn't want to follow rules) and won't do anything about it.",

I'm aware of the fact that she has less on when shes on the field compared to her photo, my justification for this was the societal view on cheerleaders when compared to girls in lingere. So I will say this once again. It's okay for them to say \"ok go 3/4ths nude if I tell you too BUT it's absolutely horrible to go 1/4th nude on your own personal page\" because 1. It's their company 2. They made a policy that this girl was aware of before joining the corporation and 3. These societal views. I don't have an emperical data to back up what I am saying but it seems you are out of touch with how society views girls who look promiscious in lingere, for you to say that people who think like this are the minority would seem (to me atleast) very intellectually dishonest. The whole point of these massive multi-billion dollar corporations is to appeal to the majority to get as much revenue as possible, there will be exceptions to this rule but the NFL isn't one of them. Furthermore, you go on and ask my thoughts on the situation regarding the teacher. I'm not sure if you're actually curious on my thoughts or if you are trying to use some kind of shaming tactic on me. To me it seems that you are using a shaming tactic on me to misrepresent me and make your arguement look better in contrast. This is known as a logical fallacy. All I can say is I don't know, as I don't fully know about the situation. I can't make an opinion on something that I don't have a good grasp on in this context.",

It's how basic economics works (and it would be hyprocritical of you to criticize it since you abide by these basic laws) as these companies are just trying to protect themselves from losses in the millions. Fuethermore the \"problem\" isn't only exclusive to females but males. Take adult acting,modeling and even male prostitution for instance. Males get paid almost <b> nothing </b>and alot of them go into debt. Us men don't complain about it though because in general we know that there is no value in men in these fields and that's just how it is. When was the last time you've seen a girl get busted for soliciting a male prostitute? The truth men and women are equal and I would argue that men are the ones being treated unfairly as we suffer in silence. Take the family court system for example, marriage etc... There is no excuse anymore for you guys. You girls are the majority of people with an education and in the workforce.",

            "commentText": "The first time it hit me: \nA few years ago I made it the the final round of the New England Patriots Cheerleaders auditions. Not only are there 2 dance rounds, but there is a round where each girl must walk in front of the judges in a bikini while their bio is read. It seemed odd that we had to do that when we already were wearing skimpy outfits during our audition. But of course the NEPC have a calendar shoot each year, which include definitely suggestive photos of each girl in tiny bikinis. I am sure the organization makes thousands off of these calendars each year. I never understood why it was adequate to pay these women 15 dollars an hour to cheer for men that literally make millions and a team that generates an enormous amount of money each year. They sell this to us by saying that this is the big break... that every door will open for us after the exposure of being on this team. By the way, in this group there were Entrepreneurs, Ivy League graduates, teachers,  and community leader. Far from the \"typical cheerleader\" stereotype. They all deserve so much better.\n\n\nThe second time it hit me:\nSome time after the audition a professor at my University asked if I would be interested in organizing a dance team for the new semi pro state basketball league. When I met with the directors, they assured me that we would all be compensated. So I found some extremely talented women and brought them together. For months we practiced three times a week + game days and promo work. We sacrificed our jobs to be there. I thought it would be a good experience for me to coach so at first I was really passionate and excited. But when we still were not paid after months of work, I started asking questions. I found out the players were making $4,000+ per game. And that was the moment I realized that because of my <b> gender,</b> no matter how hard I worked, the odds are against me. I  could go to the gym and practice as much as these men did for basketball. I could be more talented at dancing than these men are at basketball. But in the end, we don't matter. Soon I started having nightmares and eventually resigned.  Hundreds of hours wasted for \"exposure\".\n\n\nMy heart goes out to all these women that are used and thrown away. You matter.",

I did cheerleading for a while (Competition cheerleading, not sports cheerleading) \nCheerleading is really REALLY hard. I did it for extreme competition. We had to have makeup on, we had to have (and pay for!) our own uniforms and our practice shoes and our performance shoes as well as traveling expenses. We trained for hours. \nThe NFL wants to sexualize these women for their own profit, and then slut shame them when they want create their own social media image.  \nThis isn't okay. I'm so fucking tired of women being treated like this and<b>  nothing</b> happening.",

You can work hard 24/7 and pull weeds from the ground all your life but you ain't gonna get paid as much as someone like Steve Jobs who created the future and something that we use everyday and have made a necessity. Furthermore the NFL isn't slut shaming these girls, they made a policy that protects themselves from losing millions. These girls KNEW of the policy yet they STILL signed up and STILL broke the rules and STILL had the audacity to complain about it. Society doesn't view cheerleaders as sluts, however that doesn't mean they aren't sexualized. However society does view girls in lingere (yes it's lingere) with the face shes making as something negative and the NFL simply doesn't want that image. So I tell you what, sweetheart, how about you make YOUR OWN multi billion dollar company and then you can let your employees do whatever they want (like walk around naked, poop on the streets, yell at kids, whatever i dont freaking know) m'kay?",

In my opinion, cheerleading for a men's football team is a supportive, dependent role - with inequality built into the role.  Maybe women should reconsider their role or restructure the whole thing or stop supporting men's teams in the first place.  Why can't the cheerleaders be a mix of men and women?  Why can't they wear pants?  Do we need cheerleaders?",

For many it's something related such a teaching, coaching or choreographing dance or cheer, at least in part, & I've heard doing temp work is also pretty <b> common.</b>  \nI'm not a big fan of football or cheerleading for various reasons, & am even less fond of the NFL in particular, but given the massive amount they bring in as an organization & considering how much even the lowest tier benchwarmers make it is atrocious - & imo downright inexcusable - that their cheerleaders - elite athletes in their own right - don't even make a living wage during the season.  And that doesn't even begin to touch on the plethora of nonsensical inequities & other issues that are long overdue for some serious revision.",

But they have no fucking right to tell her how can she dress or not outside of working hours nor about what she can publish in her social media. It's her life! Her privacy! She is not their property! Those women are human beings, not plastic dolls, not trophies, not things! Plus, their clothing rules are hypocritical and ridiculous considering how they demand them to dress, stay <b> skinny,</b> stay muscular and show skin on the field! That company is fucking manipulating their employees, controlling their private lives, paying them way under the reasonable pay for the amount of hours they work! And they have the audacity to refuse to even have a conversation or reach an agreement or even make a statement about the issue! I have no words to describe how shameless they are.

I can imagine how thrilling and exciting being on that field is for her. Even when I got to basketball games I always take pictures with the dancers because I respect what they do and what they love. And just in the video, you can tell she loves dancing because she helps her mom in a dance studio. Who are you to judge? She's trying to make her dream job an actual dream job and not a sexist and toxic environment.",

You need to get them to drop in on 2019 where women no longer have to stand for this type of abuse. I'm behind you all the way.  \n \nCheerleaders are<b>  sex</b> symbols and without them I doubt that the players would be making as much. The cheer leaders bring in the crowd too.   It's a big scam on the wages. You gals are not being appreciated in your roll as money generators. \nYou train even harder then the players do for next to no money. \nTime to start a cheer leaders union IMHO.\nThe money men know that if they fire all cheer leaders they are going to loose out so they try to keep you under their thumb while filling their pockets. \nThis is not a fair world so if you want the respect due you, you have to fight for it. \nYou gals may look like Barbie dolls to be played with but your not and you should stand up for your rights to your fair share of the profits.\nRemember Cheer leaders can't be replaced with funky robots or costumed clowns.\n\n\nThe League knows that,<b>  \"se</b>x sells,\" it's your ace to work with.\nLets just say that all the cheer leaders posted images in sexy lingerie.  (Not recommended for the possibility of attracting stalkers but you don't have to be a cheer leader for that anyways.)  All the fans on Instagram are going to flock to the stadium to see you in real life for a chance to meet you.  If the  money men had half a brain they would encourage this practice. \n\n\nSure you're going to feel safer if you take self defense training.

The female one is about 40 times less profitable. If you want to get paid equal you have to produce equal. People, including women, generally want to see peek performance, hence they watch male sports more than female sports. Cheerleaders do not train as hard as an athlete. Cheerleaders are pretty much irrelevant to overall profit, hence they are paid poorly. If they brought double the people, they would have similar salaries to players.

As a dancer that studied the art for over 30 years, it's more training then most athletic endeavors involve.  These gals are athletes in their own right. Practice practice practice.  We use to say it was the hardest passion to perfect and involved the most energy.  \nI was never a cheer leader BTW, (Wrong body type for the era and too many other options to work with.) \nThere was one show that ran for a few years that showed the behind the scene work involved. Sorry, <b> senior </b>moment, I can't recall it's name. \nIt all revolved around the the players and the cheer leaders. It showed the amount of effort involved in the art of cheer leading.\n\n\nIf your not good enough to be one of the very few who have what it takes to join the ballet companies, don't want to be a clown or strut your stuff in the strip joints, then Cheer leading is a well respected choice. At the wages they receive, it's criminal.  Years of dance classes for what? \n\n\nSure they are all hot gals who can land a rich husband, but it's a new century and women need to be able to control their own lives if they wish to without being trophies.

My comment was based on this \"You don't see guys complaining about this crap in the porn or modeling industry\" I assumed that \"this crap\" was pay equality because that is what most of theis thread has been about. If you intended it to mean something else, then that is cool but it is easy enough to understand why I thought that you were piggybacking on the train of thought discussed earlier by someone with a similar stance as yours. \nYou say they don't deserve it BUT they do far more than work during the games. hell, I just saw my city's cheerleaders performing at a concert for an <b> old </b>school jam. They used their official uniforms and repped the team so it was all official. They work more than 10 days a year and are pretty ambassadors for the team. No one is sayign they should be able to work it as a full time job and live in luxury just that $10 an hour and having to pay out of pocket for a lot of things required of them seems nutty given the profit margins of this particular company\nCherrypicked? You gave the example so I talked about what you talked about. How is that cherry picking?\nMen don't get paid in porn? They're doing it for free?  What exception? The exception is people who make it to top tier period. Other than that it all depends on the scenes and the person. Overall women end up paid more per film and men end up paid more  during their career due to longevitiy or at least that is what some surveys,  and articles have said. The only<b>  common</b> thing seems to be that directors get the most and that's definitely still a male dominated field. It's all over the place. \nBack to cheerleaders, they seem to do a lot on the field and off but are getting paid the same as someone in a field that requires little to no training. That seems a bit off to me. I don't get why that is such a controversial statement. It's like dudes goign on an on about whether someone is worth 10 mil or 5 mil when they're traded. You may not see their value because you're just watching the game but someone in the NFL sees it or they wouldn't bother using them as ambassadors at all.",

However, I'll just take what you said as an honest mistake, no harm done.\n\n\"You say they don't deserve it BUT they do farm more than work during games. hell, I just saw my city's cheerleaders performing at a concert for an <b> old </b>school jam. They used their official uniforms and repped the team so it was all offical. They work more than 10 days a year and are pretty ambassadors for the team.\"\n\nThis is an anecdote with no emperical data to back it up. Can you say with certainty that other organizations do this? \n\n\"No one is sayign they should be able to work it as a full time job..\"\n\nThen shut the hell up because I wasn't refuting that either. If you actually read my comment instead of skimming through it you would know that I specificaly said that they get paid on how well they do their job and how much value they make in the marketplace. They very well COULD be paid lots of money... but only if they brought in enough revenue to make them worthy of earning that type of money.\n\nFurthermore, you did cherrypick my examples because you had<b>  nothing</b> to say about male modeling. You realised that you couldn't debate it, therefore you avoided it and focused all then attention on male adult actors to make it seem like you won the arguement.\n\nThe truth is men in the \"non top tier\" porn get paid very little if not any? Where do you think Manuel Ferrera and Johnny Sins started out? Working for FREE. \n\nThere is a fundemental misunderstanding that I can spot here though. I am not talking about the adult acting industry as a whole (CEO's, crew members, casting members, camera men etc...) I am talking about the front line of the industry, the pornstars. If we take a look at the industry as a WHOLE, yes males do get paid more because.. well... they wre the CEO's and the ones in high positions, women can make their own companies if they wanted to.. but they don't. If we were to focus the attention onto the frontline of the industry, we see a much different story. Women DO get paid more then men and there ARE exceptions to this rule because there are male pornstars who get paid more than some women. It's not a hard concept to understand. In general though, males make less. Link to me these surveys and articles... as if there any reliable sources. I'd prefer buisness reports from the actual companies but whatever.",

It seems that you're not ready to do that so I will wrap this up by saying have a nice life before I mute you. \nDamn. Almost made it to the mute button but had to add that Ferrerra is quoted as saying that he did it for free because he liked fucking not because the industry wasn't paying him. Maybe he lied to have a fun interview. Random truths for a chosen few isn't the same as an industry trend, right?",

The way salaries work is, if your job brings a lot of value to the company, organization or industry, then it's big. If not, then it's shit. You may work very hard, if the value you produce is really small then it doesn't matter. That's why a construction worker gets less money than a programmer who doesn't break his back working in dirty environments. But this is unacceptable for people with a victim mentality",

Only the hours where they're officially practicing/performing are clocked, which is only a fraction of the effort they put in for the job. None of the outside practice, the dance classes, the public appearances, the physical conditioning, etc etc is included. They don't get extra pay to account for the fact that they have to practice ALL YEAR for a relatively short season, so the pay is only equivalent to a part time temp job rather than a yearly salary.\n\nPart of why sports players/entertainers are paid so much is that they're getting compensated for essentially a lifetime of putting every ounce of energy and cash into their profession. A lot of these women are professional dancers or were college cheerleaders (college cheerleading is treated like the real sport it is). They're legitimate athletes, but they're treated like Hooters waitresses (or worse, at least Hooters waitresses make decent money) because of the culture of the NFL.",

Female football and male football are both businesses nowadays. The female one is about 40 times less profitable. If you want to get paid equal you have to produce equal. People, including women, generally want to see peek performance, hence they watch male sports more than female sports. Cheerleaders do not train as hard as an athlete. Cheerleaders are pretty much irrelevant to overall profit, hence they are paid poorly. If they brought double the people, they would have similar salaries to players. In short, logic > feelings and there are objective reasons for the way things are, not <b> sexism </b>or unfairness as victims want to believe for their lack of understanding and success.",
