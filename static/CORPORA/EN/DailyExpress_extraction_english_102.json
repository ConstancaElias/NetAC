        "postText": "'The icon - who will turn 60 this summer - is one of the greatest popstars of all time, but has been constantly belittled for her performances and music videos - something she says comes down to sexism and ageism.', 'Speaking to The Cut, she said: It\u2019s an outdated, patriarchal idea that a woman has to stop being fun, curious, adventurous, beautiful, or sexy past the age of 40. It\u2019s ridiculous.', 'Why should only men be allowed to be adventurous, sexual, curious, and get to have all the fun until the day they leave this earth? Why should that only be the domain of men?', 'She continued: How do we fight this? By standing up to men and by standing up to social mores or standards that say we cannot. The more women that do it, it will just be a matter of time.', 'The hitmaker - who is expected to release a new album in the near future - has had this kind of criticism throughout her career, but it seems to have a different edge to it as she grows older.', 'In the beginning of my career, I got so much flak for using sexuality as part of my creativity and was called a sexual provocateur, she recalled.', 'Now, all the challenges that I had to face 20 years ago seem ludicrous. What I am going through now is ageism, with people putting me down or giving me a hard time because I date younger men or do things that are considered to be only the domain of younger women.', 'I mean, who made those rules? Who says? I\u2019m going to keep fighting it.', 'Ten to 20 years from now, it\u2019s going to be normal. People are going to shut up.', 'Back in December the superstar appeared to confirm new music plans.', 'Asked by Anderson Cooper on Live With Kelly and Ryan when she\u2019s going back on tour, she said: Soon.', 'Madonna arrives at China Through The Looking Glass Costume Institute Benefit Gala.2015 Amid excited babble from the hosts, she clarified: 2017 was Soccer Mom in Portugal, 2018 I\u2019m coming back baby.', 'And I\u2019m coming for you!', 'Madonna is one of the best-selling artists of all time, having sold more than 300 million units worldwide.",

She's sold records and albums using 'cex' and her body, thats it. Some of the music is good, but just accept what youve done. It is not dignified to 'flaunt it' when you are older. She was a 'cex symbol', now create music for music, not for popularity or attention",
