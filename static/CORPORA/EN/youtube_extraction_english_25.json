It will have the\neffect of infuriating even more women.  Instead of looking at all sides of this issue, they will just explode like\nan A bomb.

We call a group of people \"guys\", even when it's a group full of girls we call them guys.\n\n4. There are male pronouns in female words. Like feMALE,<b>  woMAN</b>, sHE, HEr.\n\n5. There soooo many negative words towards women like b\u2022\u2022\u2022h, sl\u2022\u2022, wh\u2022\u2022\u2022.\n\nEverything I listened here wa<b> s sexis</b>m towards women.",

Is it still okay to use the word \"<b> woman\"</b> to describe a female human?  It won't be 10 years from now.  People don't care about my feelings when they describe me. I don't like it when people say that I'm tall, but<b>  nobody</b> is doing a video on that.  I'm not even that tall.  Maybe if you don't like being called feisty, you could chill out a little. What am I supposed to do?  Get on the floor and crawl?",

Perhaps you should have a word with your fellow sisters who have no issue posing in places like Instagram in suggestive poses with their breasts hanging out? Women are the ones who are \"objectifying\" themselves, they do it of their own free will, because they gain from it.\n\n\"If there was a<b>  nation</b> that was populated by women only it would be the super power of the world for a very long time.\"\n\nI'm sure it would. I guess that's why women have been men's equals when it comes to advancements in business, technology, science, sport, literature and every single other metric you could mention. No reason why they couldn't create a \"superpower\" either!\n\nOh wait, except they've contributed precisely fuck all compared to men. And if you are thinking of given the \"women were historically held back excuse\", women are held back from doing precisel<b> y nothin</b>g throughout the Western World, and still their contributions relative to men are laughable. \n\nJust another brainless feminist idiot.",

I was trying to point out just three things. 1) We often use language in automatic, stereotyped patterns. This is worth questioning in itself. Do you want to write and speak on autopilot? 2) We often use negative language to describe a quality in women where we use a positive word to describe the same quality in men: women who assert themselves in work meetings are far more often called \"domineering\" or \"aggressive\" than men are. There is a massive pile of research on this; it isn't controversial.  3) Many \"compliments\" are not taken as such by the hearer; \"feisty\" and \"articulate\" are often taken as condescending.  \n\n Here is the argument in a column. \n\n [LINK] \n\nI'm not saying <b> gender </b>differences don't exist. I'm just saying that it's worth thinking about your language and not using it in lazy stereotyped patterns. A bonus to this is that it will make you a more original and arresting speaker or writer.",

This doesn't only happen in humans but also in plenty other natural species including our closest primate family. There will always be general masculine and feminine attributes, what we see now is a push to shape language in order to not reflect reality anymore and push a postmodern understanding of the world (we are all the same, there are no biological differences) and no, that is not a good thing, that is the opposite of a good thing.\n\nHonestly I did not expect a video of such low quality coming from The Economist.",

Insightful these days counts as a video of feminist propaganda being shoved down our throats, where we're told how tough women have it when they're referred to as \"bubbly\", a term which women themselves willingly use to describe themselves all the time. Not that that matters much to the makers of this video.\n\nMeanwhile actual, real oppression of women is happening in places like the Middle East, where they're being subject to FGM, child marriage, acid attacks, and not being able to drive amongst a litany of other horrors, but that's <b> nothing </b>to what First World women have to deal with, who have to contend with being referred to as \"feisty\". I'm sure Samira living in downtown Riyadh (who is not able to leave her house without a male guardian), is thinking to herself, \"wow, I thought I had it tough, but in New York, women are referred to as bossy! How easy I have it!\"\n\nAnd if you're talking about triggered people, the most triggered of all are the makers of this video who took the time to make this bullshit about the epitome of First World problems, and being honest, it's not even a problem.\n\nI have no idea how being fed up with constantly hearing how tough the most spoiled, pampered set of people in history counts as being \"triggered?\" I guess it made sense in your head though.\n\nPerhaps you could explain that one to me?\n\nButthurt SJW liberals?

In some countries women face the kind of prejudice that we in the western world simply fully comprehend. To say that because the word \"house\" is being associated with women is in any way offensive or discriminatory is the outrageous. And are you suggesting that if we use the word \"feisty\" as often with men as we do with women that it no longer becomes a problem? I am not sure if you've noticed but there are plenty of words (such as 'macho' or 'heroic') which are more commonly associated with MEN than with women, but yet no one cares, and rightly so. In fact, the 'study' also showed that the word 'killing' is associated with men (and it seems that I should point out to some people out there that being associated with death is more offensive than being associated with housing). However, I understand that that is down to the way in which society has been seen over the course of human history and even has some roots in nature itself. I am not going to kick up a fuss.\n\nHowever, the biggest concern that I have here is the way in which this 'issue' (and I hesitate to call it such) appears to be so prominent in society today. Those students who analysed those books could have spent that time doing something useful or in some way educational. The last time I checked, universities were places of learning and developing a further understanding of the world, not places where people conduct hours of research that proves an ultimately invalid an completely uninteresting point. The west has problems of its own:<b>  racism</b>, gun voilence<b> , homophobi</b>a to name just a few. For people to spend time conducting such mind-blowingly stupid research while these crimes are happening right outside their doors is an insult to those fighting battles for equality all over the world. How about putting those intelligent young brains to work on improving healthcare, advancing modern science or simply creating a better community for their family and friends. \n\nI apologise for my small rant, but I really do think that this kind of rot undermines those who are experiencing ACTU<b> AL sexi</b>sm. I mean you can imagine the conversation:\n\nPerson 1: I experie<b> nce sex</b>ism regularly.\nPerson 2: Same, what happens to you?\nPerson 1: I wasn't allowed to go to school and I was forced into marriage at a y<b> oung</b> age. What about you?\nPerson 2: Someone called me feisty.\nPerson 1:...........",

To further my point is looking at suicide rates, self confidence is a deciding factor whether one takes their life or not. Self confidence is often granted by words  that encourage us and in interaction. Say you get these regularly used condescending compliments, which ultimately hurt your confidence and your willingness to interact with other people. This could then possibly lead to lower self confidence levels in our women and less willingness to interact with men (and women). \nTherefore making the video valid in today's society, were words have been granted big impact through our social medias, such as twitter, Facebook, etc...\n\nIn the rant of your message you're also promoting communism, were certain fields should be limited to allow research for.

                    "commentText": "Bat Man thank you for your response. I understand that not everyone shares my view point and that will always be the case. I actually looked into why suicide rates were so high, particularly in young people. It seems to me that there are two main causes of this. Firstly, our culture and idolisation of celebrities sets unrealistic goals for young people to aspire to. Particularly girls feel as though they are somehow unworthy it they don't look like a Vogue cover star. THIS seems to be what lowers young women's self esteem, not the fact that we use different words to describe them, often in situations where would be speaking ill of them in the first place. \n\nSecondly, suicide rates in young people are actually higher in boys than in girls. It seems that men have never experienced the same discrimination that women have over the course of history, so this is a surprising fact. Perhaps this is down to the stereotypes of young men/teenagers being reckless and violent. It is worth noting that in secondary school exams, girls always out perform boys and girls' achievements are often celebrated more, possibly to ensure that schools cannot be accused of discriminating against girls. However, this has the opposite effect; making boys feel intelligently inadequate to girls, who are always considered to be the smart ones. \n\nPersonally, I believe that that these two factors play a far bigger role in suicide rates than using different language to describe a person.\n\nAs for communism, it's simple: it doesn't work 99% of the time. But that's another matter.\n\nMy point is that to invest this amount of effort (like the university of Illinois did) and focus so much on one of the smallest and most insignificant 'issues' in the world is a waste. There are plenty of problems in the world, I'm sure that everyone understands that. These larger scale and more damaging forms of discrimination should be the focus of out efforts for a better world. \n\nExactly why we seems to make such a deal out of these kinds of petty problems in the west is confusing, but I think it does have an explanation.\n\nAs people grow older, (particularly through their teenage years) they feel the need to rebel against something. This is a natural response aimed at making sure that the young leave their parents and create a life of their own; it can be seen in many species. However, in our modern world, we don't have much that our teenagers can rebel against. All of the ills in our lives in the west are on a large scale and are the sort of things that are embedded in our culture and history. Rebelling against these issues could result in upsetting a large number of people. So as a solution, people feel the need to create problems to get angry at. People invent issues like this one and bring them to the forefront of public attention to satisfy a desire to change something in the world. \n\nIf everyone gets bogged down in things like this, <b> nothing </b>of any real consequence will ever change in the world. Change requires unity. So rather than making a problem to solve, let's all focus on the problems which already exist in the world and see if we can solve some of those. There are too many issues in the world to be creating new ones.",

You're right that men commit suicide more often, but an important caveat is that the rate of completed suicide is higher among men. Women do not differ from men when it comes to attempted suicide, but they are less likely to succeed in doing so. It is not exactly clear why that is the case, but this study is interesting nonetheless:  [LINK] \r\n\r\nAs for the reasons for suicide, I agree unreasonable standards are often a main reason for it, resulting in status loss and/or <b> mental </b>illness. I disagree that this is only the case for women. We have made great strides regarding<b>  gender</b>, no doubt, but our discourse is still rife with the idea that men should ultimately be ambitious and powerful and so forth. When that is the standard you have to aspire to as a man in order to be 'masculine', it is not strange to see the link with the suicide rate (whether it is in the category 'attempted' or 'completed').\n\nI think the point this video is trying to make is that our language, which often has far more implicit meaning than we give it credit for, has been shaped in a time when life still fit thos<b> e gende</b>r roles quite well, i.e. men should be hard-working and successful and women should be caring and pretty. The conundrum we now find ourselves in regardi<b> ng gend</b>er seems to be that women are slowly moving into the more traditionally masculine part<b>  of gen</b>der roles, and are less harmed by masculine expectations but are still harmed by the feminine expectations; men, on the other hand, are not moving into the traditionally feminine very much, which means the unreasonable expectations of traditional masculinity are harming men.\n\nWe should not discount language as a force for permeating 'traditional' view<b> s on ge</b>nder. I will grant you that world<b> wide, g</b>ender inequality is still very much a different and more concrete problem, but as you point out yourself regarding the suicide rate, it can also reach into the less tangible, more abstract realm of things. The more we progress as a society, the more we will be dealing with those, it seems.",

I've never really thought of 'feisty' or 'airhead' as being associated with women. Maybe that's just me. Maybe it's a difficult situation for me to understand because I've never taken a <b> blind </b>bit of notice to how we use these words with different genders and to me personally, it doesn't matter. I find it hard to understand why some people find 'feisty' more offensive 'killing'. \n\nWhile the point you make about language having a more implicit meaning than we give it credit for is definitely true, it is important in a world so filled with hate speech that we learn to grow a slightly thicker skin when it comes to what other people say about us. Not so much so that we end up tolerating<b>  racist</b> o<b> r homophobi</b>c language (which is never acceptable), but so that we don't let the hidden/implicit meanings of words get to us.

It is not that one is worse, it is that they both entrench and permeate certain views that might not always be good for our society. My personal views, as a male feminist, diverge slightly from the mainstream in that I think the way we use our language and the way we see <b> gender </b>is not exclusively harmful to women, although it is generally more harmful to them as they have historically been marginalised to a far greater extent.\n\nI, too, am often unaware of my own biases and stereotypes, but it is nonetheless interesting to try to fight them, in a way. It is strange to see, once you notice it, that boys are more often told not to cry, and girls are more often told not to be 'bitchy', and how these subtle differences in language and norms stratify society along the lines of<b>  gender</b>. I also realise I may have treated women less seriously on an intellectual level in the past, and treated men who did not pay for their female date as somehow 'lesser' because they did not fit the role of provider. This is not universal, of course, and some may subconciously hold more biases than others, but the point is that they are often subconcious, and therefore harder to spot. Just as over<b> t racis</b>m, embedded in legislation, is often easier to see, but the more subconcious and instincti<b> ve raci</b>sm is far harder to spot.\n\nTo be critical of our language does not necessarily mean taking offense. I would be the first to argue that our biases do not necessarily mean we do not intend well. But as our conversation proves, you can both be happy, self-confident and polite within the status quo, yet still be critical of it and aim higher.",

I am sure that as a male many people use biased language to me everyday, but I've never really taken any notice and it does not effect me in the slightest.  At the end of the day, if someone calls you 'simple', then they are insulting your intelligence. If someone calls you an airhead, they too are insulting your intelligence. One is not more offensive than the other, they both mean the same thing. However this does not apply with killing and feisty. Feisty means to have a notably aggressive or active nature, and I'm pretty sure we all know what killing means and what it's associated with. I am not of the opinion that these are equally as harmful, but the again everyone finds different things to be so. Killing has no positive connotations whatsoever, whereas feisty is often associated with those women who defy stereotypes of being weak and are on a more equal level with their male counterparts. The only context in which feisty is offensive to a <b> woman </b>is if they wish to be seen as weaker or perhaps 'ladylike'. So to sum up, associating someone with killing is to put them on a level of criminals and violence, whereas to associate a<b>  woman</b> with being feisty is to acknowledge her strength and her ability to defy the stereotypes which we have held about women for too long.",

Given how personal freedom is such a highly sought after ideal, why do we choose the side of repression of speech? Is the \"right\" to be un-offended more important than free speech?\n\nNow it's great to discuss this as a matter of ideals, but when it comes to real life it's undoubtedly best to adhere, to some degree, to both sides of the argument.

Also, a Canadian Cabinet Minster recommended that workers from Service Canada should refrain using<b>  gender</b> specific words like mother and father and start using the word \"parent.\" Conservative opposition politicians mocked the suggestion by jokingly considering changing mother's and father's day to \"parent day.\" Okay, the second evidence wasn't technically forcing but suggesting, but Service Canada workers might be in trouble if he or she - I mean \"they\" us<b> e gende</b>r specific language. Dear readers, I'm not trying to scare you. I'm just saying political correctness has gone too far. In case you were wondering, Canada's leading political party is the Liberal Party and our Prime Minister is Justin Trudeau. Yes, I'm Canadian and yes, we do have free healthcare, but this is the kind of stuff we have to deal with.",

The other video was about protecting free speech and being careful not to place limits on it, that, though they may seem noble at first, would undercut one of our most important rights. That's point one. This video was presented in a very neutral, academic tone until the very end when the presenter suggests it would be a good thing to use words in an original manner and perhaps also in a way that does not give unwanted offense. That's the other point. Please explain how that contradicts the notion of free speech.

My point is that they can both occupy space in the same universe (and in your mind, if you let them) and are in no way incompatible with one another.\n\nBut what about social pressure to curb speech. Why is that a bad thing in the first place? Should we not care about whether the words we use offend people? Do you not modify your speech depending on your audience, or is it just \"all Phlebas all the time,\" regardless of who you're talking to? You can be polite while still being a steadfast proponent of free speech. Also, someone like yourself, who is clearly adept with language, can surely find any number of different words to make the same exact point. Or you can strategically choose to be offensive -- it's your call. The freedom is still yours. I think one of the things about this video I found so interesting is that some of the words we've used throughout history turn out to have an unconscious association with <b> gender,</b> and might be offensive to people without the author even realizing it.

                    "commentText": "+ConsideringPhlebas\r I was wrong about that. Sorry. But In the US we still do have prohibitions on free speech, like \"fighting words\", obscenity and incitements to violence. These all must pass a fair level of scrutiny. And as you know better than me, speech laws are relatively more strict in European countries. \n\nIf it were up to me, I'd choose not to prosecute the Youtuber you spoke of. It's obviously offensive, but I think there are better things for authorities to worry about. That being said, he's an entertainer who relies on saying offensive things to get views and instill delight into viewers yearning to hear obnoxious and offensive language they wouldn't dare say in public, or to another person. You know why? Because that's how you lose friends and make people not want to interact with you. I'm sure you can find friends that would be more than happy to partake in <b> Nazi </b>jokes with you, and more power to you guys, but you will most likely also have friends/acquaintances/family who would rather not. And that's fine as well; you would just make sure not to speak like that with them. It's that easy. You respect their opinions/sensibility and hopefully they respect yours. We have always operated by spoken/unspoken rules of conduct and civility. \n\nI understand that this is very different from codified laws that hold power to punish you. I also disagree with more vague hate speech laws that can punish speech meant to be comedic. I just think that there are more important issues that one could focus their attention on. The average person isn't going to be sent to prison for tweeting something offensive. Go on Twitter - there are millions of offensive tweets that Twitter just isn't going to bother with. You will most likely be fine. I suspect that Dankula was targeted because many users reported him, due to his large following. Through out history, champions of free speech seemed to be those defending the right to criticize governments. The worst human rights violators around the world continue to police speech as a means to squash any possibility of dissent. It seems that now, in the largely freer and more democratic nations, defenders of free speech only want to protect the right to offend. I agree that offending someone shouldn't warrant government intervention, but the average person isn't going to get locked up for a<b>  racist</b> Facebook post. \n\nI know I'm not going to change your mind on anything, but it seems that our interests are just widely different. I could think of a dozen other issues that affect millions of more lives and are barriers to progress around the world, but yet people in this comment section are getting worked up because certain words hav<b> e gende</b>r specific connotations and usages, that result in people understandably feeling marginalized or stereotyped. You aren't going to get convicted for calling<b>  a wom</b>an \"feisty\". This simply isn't an issue. You and I can both agree that Dankula shouldn't be fined, now can you agree that if someone wishes you not call them a certain word, it would be in your best interest to respect their opinion? These are two vastly different issues. And as someone else pointed out, everything except the last line in the video was just a presentation of linguistic facts and observations. Hope you have a good day.",

The explanation you gave which is the pedestrian one, which is at least slightly better than \"Wombs are expensive, Sperm is Cheap\".\n\nSo yes, the easier answer is more that conceptualization of words with men and women comes from our innate biases of which one is expressed in what is called the (Women are wonderful) effect that is a term to express behavior traits based on the innate imperative of <b> sexual </b>dimorphism that are specific to our specie. \n\nAnd the specific<b>  sex</b> differences in needs to procreate leads to results so that women are heavily inclined to lean towards tendencies of Hypo-agency and therefore we observe this and will describe with more passive wording and less emphasis on agency, since that associate to sacrifice and empathy-damping.\n\nWhereas men will have a heavy proclivity to lean towards the tendencies of Hyper-Agency and described in active wordings and less emphasis on being a observer or patient since that associates to inactivity when risks are high.\n\nAnd all of gets more pronounced in each individ the more individual freedom each can on as equal playing field there can be since then individuals to fight in th<b> e sexua</b>l market place, and have the best \"ads\" so to speak.\n\nThe basic concepts are easy but it's the devil in the detail that's interesting.",

The strength comes from th<b> e woma</b>n displaying masculine behavior... why can't<b>  a wom</b>an be strong in a female way? Is it not kind of sexist to say that the female form of strength (compassion, empathy, understanding) isn't considered strong, so a female is only 'strong' if she displays a masculine form of brute force (fighting, aggressiveness)?\n\nMen and women are capable of both types of strength but its obvious that e<b> ach </b>sex swings further in one direction than the other,  to varying degrees. I think both forms of strength have importance and the h<b> uman </b>race requires each of them.",

If the word \"feisty\" had a condescending undertone a few decades ago, that doesn't mean we should avoid it today. Words only have the meaning that society attributes to it and with time, this meaning may change. \nI don't think anyone who says <b> a woma</b>n is feisty today has the intention to come across as condescending. The meaning has changed, all that matters is the underlying intention. Words convey our feelings and thoughts and are themselves empty. The feeling or thought we wish to convey with them is the only substance they have. So it's completely redundant to look to historical application of words if the modern meaning has changed; the modern, non-sexist thoughts and feelings that it conveys is the only relevant factor today.",

Besides, I would never want anyone else to alter who they are just for my own satisfaction. Everybody should be who they want to be and the only ground norm should be to respect everyone and treat them equally. \nI also don't think we should be quick to connect the historical meaning of words to the intention of those that utter them today. For example, \"<b> gay<b> \"</b</b>> used to mean happy, now it means something else entirely. Words like \"feisty\" may have had a condescending undertone some decades ago, but perhaps those that use the word today have no intention whatsoever to be condescending? To me, it's not about the words that are used, but the underlying intention of the person that uses it. As long as the intention is sound, no harm is done. You should be superficial in that regard. As my last point, language and its variety of words shouldn't be attacked. We should not strive for a language that has only a relatively small set of words that are labeled neutral and okay to use. Language has to develop naturally in order for it to remain a healthy, living language.",
