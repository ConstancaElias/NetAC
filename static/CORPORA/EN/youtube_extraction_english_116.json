M<b> y ol</b>d boss, who lost hearing on one of his ears due to childhood fever, wouldn't dare to wear a hearing aid because he was already 40 and pressure was mounting against him.\nDuring the meetings, all of my ideas and inputs went totally ignored, until younger associates just repeated what I had just said and were congratulated by the group.\nWhen that started happening all the time, I decided to leave them and take my 'brilliant ideas' to their competitor. Luckily, my new workplace values actual diversity <b> of ra</b>ce, religion, body typ<b> es, </b>age, thinking, etc<b> .\nMy</b> old workplace just pretended that they're diverse \u2014 in early 2010s they finally started to use nonwhite models in ads, and now they even claim to support diversity. BUT only if you're <b> belo</b>w age 26,<b>  tall, </b>skinny, and Q2 personality type. (Yes, I had to take a training course on how everybody there is only Q2.)\nThank goodness I left them.",

He is clearly on the verge of burning out. Living in a cheaper city will reduce his stress levels and allow him to think more clearly about the several other options he has and that he will see if he taps into his creativity. Thinking that way is what saved my life both mentally and financially. I'm not out of the woods yet, and I certainly miss London. However I feel better overall. I wish him all the best.",

I keep hearing older people talk about the youth...the future but they don't talk about the progress of their peers. Your peers are still the future too. They are growing, learning and getting better. We need more immersive programs in adapting to new technology. Keeping up with new skills courses. Scholarships for people over 50 who want to continue their education(when i have more money and influence I will do this. Actual? I will set up a small scholarship asap to get me going). Conferences/organizations that tackle this problem. Lastly, for those younger people who don't care about this? Let me appeal to your selfish side. One day you will be in this same position bitching abo<b> ut agei</b>sm and waiting for acceptance. Think of this as planting seeds for self preservation.

What should we expect? Its getting so bad these people are growing up thinking \"They should be neglected and isolated\". We need to reconnect communities with everyone in them instead of just \"people their own <b> age\"</b> or \"people from their own neighborhood\" or, \"people from their grade\".",

Biden is more than 65.  Obama himself wouldn't fit into any of these so called hip offices since he himself is 50 plus.  \n\nI remember watching a movie called Logan's Run from the 1970s of a society that killed people over a certain <b> age.</b>  Logan himself was a police officer who when he aged out had gone on the run with a<b>  woman</b> who also aged out and they escaped into the ruins of the ancient civilization.  Their they found a man above th<b> e ag</b>e of 60.   He was active and smart and wasn't senile.  Seems like art is imitating life.",
