        "postText": "I\u2019m 27 and I\u2019ve never been in a relationship.', 'I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d still be single at this age, and it\u2019s not for the want of trying. I would like to find someone, but I\u2019m more aware than ever of how much pressure there is to \u2018couple up\u2019, and it has to stop.', 'Meeting people is not easy. On nights out, I have approached people. I\u2019ve tried meeting people through friends. I\u2019ve been openly vocal on social media about my relationship status. I\u2019ve even applied for First Dates.', 'Yet, I\u2019ve found myself in my late twenties with no experience of dating, and I\u2019ve become so used to the single life that the idea of becoming anything more than friends with someone seems daunting.', 'I\u2019ve never been close to anyone. I\u2019ve never been kissed, never been on a proper date and I\u2019ve never felt love \u2013 I\u2019m not even sure I know what it feels like.', 'Society tells us that there is someone out there for everyone. A relationship is painted as perfect and something that should be desired and achieved.', 'You are also made to feel like it\u2019s wrong to not be in a relationship, and that there\u2019s something wrong with you for being single. This bothers me a lot and I am starting to wonder, could there actually be something wrong with me?', 'After all, it\u2019s not that easy to just love someone. It has to be reciprocated; you both have to feel the same way.', 'Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I\u2019ve \u2018liked\u2019 many people. Although looking back, it might be better described as infatuation, as it\u2019s always been one-sided and never gone any further.', 'My school years were nothing short of chaotic: I didn\u2019t have many male friends and was constantly taunted for having friends that were girls and bullied about being gay.', 'It sounds silly, but as everyone was saying it, I just started to believe this was who I was. I was so confused.', 'There were a few times in school where I took a liking to a couple of individuals, but I found it really difficult to be honest about my feelings, so would just keep quiet while everyone else around me was building relationships and having their first girlfriend or boyfriend.', 'I now know that I am bisexual, but it has taken me a long time to even admit that to myself.', 'It\u2019s harder than ever to find someone with so many dating apps on the market.', 'These apps work for many but I\u2019ve had such rubbish experiences.', 'One in particular sticks out: I matched with a guy on Tinder and we were talking, flirting and getting to know each other \u2013 things were going well.', 'Then out of nowhere, he asked me about the clothes size I wear and what size waist I was. I remember thinking, what the hell, is this real?', 'We didn\u2019t meet up.', 'There is huge social pressure to be in a relationship. You are made to feel like it\u2019s wrong to have never been in one, like you\u2019re some alien creature who doesn\u2019t have feelings.', 'Sometimes I\u2019ll be chatting with friends and they will start discussing their partners \u2013 how annoying they are or how cute they can be \u2013 and I can\u2019t join in.', 'Then there are the awkward family parties, the weddings, the funerals \u2013 all those occasions when people ask: \u2018When are you going to find yourself a nice man?\u2019 or comment that \u2018you aren\u2019t getting any younger\u2019 and that \u2018time waits for no one\u2019.', 'We have to stop putting pressure on people who have never had a relationship. It\u2019s unnecessary and quite frankly no one else\u2019s problem.', 'We have to respect that not everyone will have the same journey in life.', 'While the thought of a relationship is exciting and something that I\u2019m interested in, it is really important to make sure that I\u2019m in the right place and ready for what the future holds.', 'We all need to feel confident enough to be able to put ourselves out there. It can\u2019t be forced \u2013 you have to be comfortable with who you are and what you\u2019re looking for.', 'It may take time, but surely time is better than rushing into something?', 'Personally, I\u2019d like to focus on myself for a while \u2013 get in a good head space and feel body confident first \u2013 so that I know I\u2019m making the right decisions.', 'I\u2019m just a guy wanting someone to love me, but I want to wait for the right time for me.",
