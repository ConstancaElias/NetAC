            "commentText": "if someone need the text here you go:) \nAustralia's aborigianl people have faced extreme historical persecution. so much so, that in 1998 Australia implemented an annual. \"National Sorry Day\" This holiday serves as a form of a appologi, and it raises awarensess of indigenous populations. \r\nSo who are Australia's aboriginal people? Well, Australia is home to many different indigenous populations. they include the Wiradjuri in New South Wales, and the Noongar in Western Australia. Aboriginal populations are often grouped together and referred to as \"aborigines\", however some consider the term pejorative. instead, legally, the native populations of Australia are referred to as \"Aboriginals and torres Strait Islanders\". some also prefer regional terms, like \"Koori\" in New South Wales, or \"murri\" in Queensland.\r\nRecently, a genetic study found that native Australian peoples may have left Africa up to 75,000 years ago, \"likely representing one of the oldes continous populations outside Africa\". For centuries they thrived in Australia usually in nomadic societies. some developed distinct tools like the boomerang, used for hunting, and the didgeridoo, a musical instrument whitch is still popular today. their extensive lagends and oral traditions are sometimes referred to as \"Dreaming\", and help exsplain their way of life and the world around them. by the the time eauropeans first established a colony in Australia in 1788, native populations were thought to number around 300,000, and there may have been an estimated 300 different aborigianls launguages spoken.\r\nHowever, with the subsequent colonization of Australia, new diseases, violence spurred by raciscm, and oppressive land-use policies deveastated many of the traditional societies. currently, aboriginal people account for just 3% of the Australian population. only about 75 aboriginal languages still remain, and many are in dagner of dying out completely. Up until several decades ago aboriginals and torres Strait Islanders, faced extreme <b> racism,</b> and goverment encroachment on their territories. many where not given Australian citizenship, nor federal suffrege until the mid 20th century. Altso, during the time, the Australian government supported forcibly taking aboriginal children away from their parents. (as we whatched a movie about) The reason for such policies varied but maby claimed it was for \"chil protection\" and \"resocialization\". The children taken away from their homes where eventually known as the \"stolen Generation\" and were often raised to be domestic servants and laborers. The govermant has since formally apologized for their part in creating the \"Stolen Generation\", and \"National Sorry Day\" is specifically in honnor of them.\r\nalthough in modern times, there has been a huge change in the governments's attitudes towards abouriginal people, high rates of unemployment, poverty, crime, and health problems for the populations persist. Aboriginal representation in the Australian government also remains low. And even today, land disputes between indigenous groups and the government are ongoing",

My dad bought that truck with the money he worked for ($37,250) and he is now in hospital. We are nice to them and when they walk around in groups they have no respect nor integrity. Now i don't feel sorry for them. And then when they get in trouble at school they scream out <b> racist </b>so the teachers feel bad for them. I hate how then manipulate people. This world has gotten way to soft. If Australia had its own Donald Trump i swear the aboriginies will be shipped to africa where they belong in their own environment. \n\nEdit: sorry I'm just really emotional because my mum couldn't afford rent this week. And those pesky Aboriginals keep on dumping trash all on our lawn.",

It's just a pity we didn't push back earlier & harder against your tyranny, it wasn't even until the 1960's that we were allowed to call ourselves \"Australian\" as opposed to \"subjects of the British empire\"\n\nEnough British propaganda! We Australians need to acknowledge our REAL history & unify our country! Aboriginals are a HUGE part of the culture we are today & enough of the suppression of that!",

                    "commentText": "+Dmoney Ali     The First People?\n\nIn Chapter 1 'An Aboriginal Invasion of Australia' by Queensland author Rodney Liddell he states: \n\nThe irrefutable and astounding anthropological evidence that the original indigenous aborigine of Australia was of a Papuan <b> race </b>[Ulotrici] and not the present<b>  race</b> of aborigines [Cymotrici] whose Pre-Dravidian ancestors invaded Australia from Southern India and Ceylon [Sri Lanka] and annihilated the original Papuan Aborigines of Australia.\n\nThe original Australian inhabitants, the Negritoes (the Ulotrici), were hunted down and wiped out by invading aborigines who came down from India.\n\nThe tip of Cape York was one of the major landings used by the invaders who arrived in either canoes or on rafts. Archaeologists in 1973 decided to look for campsites and other evidence on the Cape, finding fireplaces and middens. Although unreliable, carbon dating of shells and other organic matter was used.\n\nTo the horror of the investigating academics, the best they could come up with was between 600 and 1,100 years of occupation by the Aborigines. Which begs the question; What about the claim Aborigines have lived in Australia for 40,000+ years?\n\nAboriginal land claims, native title and land rights are based on a false anthropological premise and are totally fraudulent according to astounding new Australian archaeological discoveries and recent linguistic studies.",

There's a lot of fascinating documentaries, literature and films about the Polynesians and their way finding method that used celestial analysis and ocean currents for navigation. Disney's Moana focuses on this historic Polynesian chapter too. You should look at the area that encompasses the 'Polynesian Triangle' and the area they managed to cover many thousands of years ago, all without the aid of modern navigational technology. Truly mind blowing.",

Another horrible fact is in Indonesia, only the Indonesian langauge is recognized as the official language whereas the other 600 languages (50% of them in West Papua) spoken there have no recognition causing them to die out.

You see, there's no such thing as evolution, it's all bullshit from atheist dumbass god-rejecting scientists who have no idea in hell what they're talking about...Your CREATOR, Father God in heaven, who gave life to each one of us, flooded the world in 2500 BC, exactly as the Bible tells us. \nWe all came from Noah and his family (total of 8 people). Jesus came to reconcile us back to our Father in heaven. Everyone has sin in them, and none of you are able to remove it from yourself, so Jesus did it for you. \n\nIf man had been here so much as only 20,000 years, proper scientists will tell you that the earth's population would be so large that we would be standing toe-to-toe TEN PEOPLE HIGH on all the landmass of the earth, that's by calculation of normal birth-rates, it can all be counted mathematically. Count in reverse from the 7 billion we have today, by normal birth-rates in reverse, we get t<b> o zer</b>o numbers of people at 2500BC, comprendo? The flood, 2500BC! Capiche? Read your Bible and wake-up!\n\nAnyway, if you need more proof for 'creation' by God, go to...  [LINK] \n\nAlso, for your information, i'm sick-&-tired of hearing all this garbage that Aboriginals own Australia, NO SUCH THING! By any law in this universe, whether man's law, God's law or universal law, you only own what you MAKE or what you PAY FOR, capiche? The Aboriginals did not make the sun that shines on Australia, GOD IN HEAVEN DID! The Aboriginals did not make the rivers that flow in Australia, GOD IN HEAVEN DID! The Aboriginals did not make the animals that bounce in Australia, GOD IN HEAVEN DID! The fact is, the Aboriginals never made a single thing of nature in this land of Australia, not so much as a single pebble or leaf, capiche? So then how do they OWN IT??? Blah blah, let's get back to truth... Christianity and God in heaven own Australia, the Aboriginals never made or paid for so much as a single blade of grass! UNDERSTAND? So how do you own something you NEVER MADE???????? Sorry to burst your bubble, but only to clearly establish that they o<b> wn NOTHI</b>NG! Truth is better than lies. \nI am a native of a land that the British colonized too, so i'm qualified to speak on the issue, and I don't go around claiming that it's my land, or holding today's whites guilty for the sins of their forefathers, because living first anywhere particular on earth DOESN'T MEAN YOU OWN IT! Especially when you didn't make or pay for it, capiche? \nDo you wanna know the truth? Here's some truth for you... The Bible (Psalm 24:1) \"The earth is the LORD's, and everything in it, the world and all its people belong to him.\" \n\nPsalm 50:10 \"in fact, every animal of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills.\" \n\nGod gave Australia to the British protestant Christians, whether you like it or not! God, Jesus and Christians OWN AUSTRALIA. \n\n1 Corinthians 3:22 \"or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; EVERYTHING IS YOURS; and you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God.\" \n\nGame over boys and girls, time to wake-up! Truth always wins over fallacy!",

That bright shining moment dissipated as white settlement pressed further up the Parramatta and Hawkesbury Rivers.\u00a0 Conflict arose because of resentment\u00a0to white's taking the fishing and hunting areas of the locals, and the indigenous people helping themselves to the livestock of the settlers.\u00a0 It went downhill from there.",

They find some <b> alcohol </b>to ease their depression and a shitty job and then we end up at your comment! White people are completely opposite they will get good educations and live in urban areas. There is literally<b>  nothing</b> we can do about it except donating a lot of money which won't work at all or we could drag them from their towns and try to \"re-modernize\" them which may work but every human rights group in the world  would probably fuck us over and once again we will be the \"evil white people\".

            "commentText": "I'm so sick of the lies about \"the stolen generations\". While everyone can agree that the initial fighting against aboriginal people was wrong, the whole stolen generation things is frequently lied about. \n\"Aboriginal children were never removed from their families in order to put an end to Aboriginality or, indeed, to serve any improper government policy or program. The small numbers of Aboriginal child removals in the twentieth century were almost all based on traditional grounds of child welfare. Most children affected had been orphaned, aban\u00addoned, des\u00adtitute, neglected or subject to various forms of domestic violence, <b> sexual </b>exploitation and<b>  sexual</b> abuse. Historians have given Western Australia a particularly loathsome reputation, but when you examine the records you find the majority of children placed in state Aborigi\u00adnal settlements were from destitute families and they went there with their parents. In New South Wales, some children became part of an apprenticeship indenture program to help Abo\u00adriginal youth qualify for the workforce. A significant number of other children were vol\u00aduntarily placed in institutions by Aboriginal parents to give them an education and a better chance in life.\"\nAnd hardly any of us take the whole sorry day things seriously. Like really you want me to apologise to a group of people I di<b> d nothin</b>g to, and to a group of people who have h<b> ad nothi</b>ng done to them? It's history. The truth is aboriginal people get so many benefits because of this now it is ridiculous, and much l<b> ike bl</b>ack folk in the US are being incentivised to become single mothers and raise disadvantaged children, they are only being incentivised to being unambitious and unproductive individuals who live off welfare and use the money they get to buy goonbags and take taxi trips to the bottlo-O. This is a generalisation here obviously and I don't mean to say all aboriginals are like this. Of course not. But it is a large problem, which when you actually think about it, is the governments fault. \nWe need to stop handing out all this benefits and start realising that they are just Australians, the<b> re's not</b>hing extra special about them, and we need to do what the true definition of equality is, and treat them like we treat the rest of us.\nHaving sorry day and all these aboriginal programs in schools and stuff is only adding to the division. The most frustrating shit ever.",

When the British went to other countries they formed agreements with the local population. Here they didn't even try to play nice, instead they killed and raped and wiped out the aboriginal people, then proceeded to steal their children and force them to be raised to be servants. Technically aboriginal people were not slaves, however they worked for a small wage which could then be taken from them as payment for food and lodging, so they were basicly slaves.",

I have one final question for you;\n\nYou claim to not be of Arabian decent, then why do you defend and call Arabs purebred? \n\nEnglish is clearly not your native language, however your sentence structure is set out like it was translated from Arabic.\n\nIf you are not Arab, why would you hold them in such high regard?",

            "commentText": "Yep, the Brittish Empire did this sort of thing in many countries, so did the Spanish and Dutch etc. Taking land and killing off the native people has been going on for centuries, thousands of years, even in the Bible. But, no it's not right. This is closely mirrored in the USA with Native Americans, and many other countries like New Zealand, China,\u00a0South America\u00a0etc. Do some research of what people believed 200 years ago, even 100 years ago, look at the science of the time, medical treatments, what governments were doing all over the world, people were ignorant and small minded, plus every world power has expanded their borders, taken land, killed off natives. The laws have changed, rights have changed, peoples perceptions have changed. The history of this Country is marred by this, but we have grown, and are still growing and learning. But, go through the history of any country and you will find persecution, <b> racism,</b> killings, land theft and a lot more. Don't judge people by what their grand parents, great grand parents did, but by what they do! Do you judge Germany today for what happened in the early 1900's? Should the Pope answer for what the Roman empire did? How do they get away with using the word \"news\"? This channel is\u00a0digital vomit! And your facts are wrong, there were closer to 700 languages, Queensland First Australians don't like being called \"Murries\", there are dozens of tribes from Queensland, you pointed out not grouping people to avoid stereotypes, yet you ignorantly did it.",

Aborignals have hidden stories that are all over Australia as left overs the stories are myths of creatures like bird headed people, giant snakes and the Aborignals turning into animals\n7.

Yes, invasion is morally and ethically wrong, but it has been happening for thousands of years by almost every group of people on the planet since humans migrated out of Africa over 100,000 years ago. History is not as linear as you may think. And you must remember, when aboriginals arrived on the Australian continent from south east Asia roughly 50 thousand years ago, they changed the face of Australia forever, the largest extinction event in Australia was caused by the aboriginals hunting all of the ancient mega-fauna (large marsupials) to extinction and obliterating the areas of ancient rain forest which was once widespread across Australia by burning for the purpose of hunting. So the relationship between the land and the people was not as harmonious as many people think. This is not, in any way <b> racist,</b> this is fact. The same applies in every part of the world and to all people. As I grew up, lived and currently work the Aboriginal communities across Arnhem Land I have probably done more for their cause in the past week than you have done in you're entire life. \u00a0\nAnd too you're point about Aboriginal people receiving benefits because its \"their\" land... Does that mean when I visit or move to Scotland, as I am an indigenous person of northern Britain, am I entitled to such benefits?",

However you can't say that they were \"happy\" with their <b> old </b>way of life either. Happiness is totally subjective. Content, probably, as it was the only way of life they knew of. Do you think all groups of Aboriginal people were running around the continent holding hands, singing in a meadow of flowers under a rainbow of happiness or something? If you do you have an incredibly bias and warped sense of history and even reality. Life in prehistoric Australia was incredibly tough and harsh. Which is why populations were small and very sparse, as resources were sparse. Life expectancy was low and the threat of tribe vs tribe conflict was high due to said lack of resources. I am not stating these facts to belittle or degrade the aboriginal people in any way. I'm in fact doing the opposite. I greatly admire the culture and their way of life. They were able to carve out a rich culture and heritage from surviving thousands of years in almost complete isolation in such a harsh, infertile continent.\n\nOh and please explain to me how the term 'nomadic' is<b>  racist</b>. It simply means that a group of people do not permanently inhabit an area of land and must migrate to sustain their population. Many groups of people proudly preserve their nomadic way of life, such as the Mongolians and Turkic people who live on the Steppes of Central Asia.",

            "commentText": "Aussie Aboriginal culture is THE MOST complex and rich cultures i have ever been exposed too. They experienced some of the worst genocide and 'assimilation' through the stolen generation by white invaders yet the culture is still going? A lot of the culture was sadly  lost and the number of elders is decreasing very quickly and knowledge being passed on to those younger generations who traditionally become the new elders are being forced to leave there land in order to break out of the poorer conditions they are forced to live in. Even with all that and their is really no representation at all in society unless you go into these areas. As a white person I think I was exposed for about a term at school to the culture and most of it was from a white christian perspective which still has a supremacist focus. So when i got out of school and decided to learn more I was shocked at how complex it is and rich even after all of the stuff they have gone through in history and still today. Government funding goes into programs that assist in them getting a footing in modern society resulting in most of the kids still being 'stolen' from their culture subconsciously. The horrible truth is the government needs to start supporting their culture and making sure the elders are supported to sustain the culture and even help in finding lost traditions and giving them back to the people. They are very resilient people and the entire foundation of their culture is tethered to the land which we continue to take to build on which actually cuts of 'songlines' which are dreaming tracks they follow for SO MANY purposes both survival and spiritual. I can stress how obsessed i am with this culture. It is amazing and I dont get why the government is so <b> blind </b>to it. Even from a monetary point of view the aboriginal culture is a massive tourist attraction but it also could contribute alot to how to run society better. There is a wisdom about them. Anyway rant over.",

They knew about astrology better than the Greeks and recycled their \"rubbish\".  They knew how to navigate using the stars and could track any animal or person through the bush. \n\nOh and they never \"interbred\" and married their cousins like Europeans do. Matriarchal systems weren't considered bad (early feminism) \u2764\n\n\nBut the \"white man\" chopped down all the trees which created salt lakes and forced animals to relocate. Used toxic fertilizers on their farms which poluted the fresh water rivers and mass killed birds and fish. Numerous animals endangered and many extinct. Forrests and bush destroyed.\n\nOh and let's not forget how <b> dumb </b>the first settlers were to try and start a war with the Emus. Hahaha the Emus won that fight,",

Every aspect of their culture is like PNG not Aboriginals. There were millions of Aboriginal people prior to invasion, living in harmony, taking care of their country and abiding by, as well as practicing our Lore. Today, we continue to feel the effects of the past atrocities and try our best to live. The POMS (who majority of the White so-called Aussies; basically are and have descended from) have never compensated nor payed for the illegal squatting on Aboriginal land and still haven't today; they even believe they are from this country. Creating a theory of birth in Aus meaning they come from here, yet much of their so-called culture and living standards are that of England as well as Europe.",

They would have systematically eliminated every trace of you and selectively removed and eaten your livers as they did in all the islands they conquered.Then they would rewrite history so that you never existed.

Aboriginals can then join the rest of society.  Here are some examples of some organizations that assist Aboriginals.  Good luck for example trying to get housing with  Aboriginal Housing Victoria or legal aid with Victoria Aboriginal Legal Service  etc.  Do you know there are housing blocks JUST for Aboriginals? Wow.  Furthermore, Abstudy (ONLY for Aboriginals) recipients get far MORE than Austudy ( for all other Australian <b> ethnic </b>groups/races) recipients.  Don't believe me?  Look up the differences.  There is definitely racial discrimination when it comes to the allocation of tax payer resources and that is not a good thing.",

I am sorry mate but you need to change your name stupid man because you are either stupid (which is what I suspect) or you are smart but are deliberately lying because you are just a liar and cant help yourself.

Give me some examples of these stolen ideas (and please try and find something invented in the last thousand years), and for extra credit explain how someone in India driving a car invented by a white guy has not 'stolen' this from white people but a white accountant has 'stolen' numbers from India people? \nYou actually have no idea of what you speak and are just regurgitating shit people have told you.

It really really complicates what the government can do in the present day. A lot of aboriginal kids are sick with days of snot dried on their faces and stinking of piss and faeces from wearing days <b> old </b>nappies. A lot aren't wearing shoes or jumpers in winter and it's not uncommon to see a baby's bottle filled with fanta or coke.<b>  Sexual</b> abuse and child pornography became a really big problem on the aboriginal communities (government has since banned it along wit<b> h alcoho</b>l) a<b> nd alcoh</b>ol abuse is a huge problem for just countless countless aboriginal adults. A lot of aboriginal kids sniff glue, petrol, deodorant, nail glue etc etc. Anyway, my point is that numerous aboriginal kids are living in really bad conditions staying with their parents but it's too hard for the government to intervene unless they end up in the hospital or the police station. A lot of aboriginal kids need to be in foster homes but are left with their parents who many times h<b> ave alco</b>hol/substance issues to be abused, neglected, and grow up to repeat this pattern. Very complicated issues and very hard for a foreigner to understand the present day issues that Australians and aboriginal Australians face because of each other. \nKnowledge= Australian who lives in densely aboriginal populated town and works in health industry.",

In a basin of the sandhill amid broken shells, he picked up a large fragmenting, football sized<b>  lump</b> of petrified mud. protruding from one of the fragments he found a small bronze coin. Years later a Melbourne's\u00a0 Museum Numismatist would identify it as Greek, and that it had been minted in Egypt during the reign of the Greek Ptolemy Philometor the 6th, in the 2ND century.\n\nThe suggestion as to how the coin turned up where it was found is, of course, that it had been left behind by\u00a0 ancient visitors; Greek explorers perhaps, or even Arabs, Indians and Malayans with whom the Greeks traded. Similarly, in 1961 a family picnicking on the Daly river, west of Katherine in the Northern Territory, found a Gold Scarab, on object of worship of the Ancient Egyptians. How did this valuable ornament find\u00a0 its way to such a remote location? One might ask the same question of a 2,000 yea<b> r ol</b>d carved stone head\u00a0 of the Ancient Chinese Goddess Shao Lin (Protectress of mariners at sea), recovered from a beachfront\u00a0 hillside at Milton, on the New South Wales far south coast in 1983.",

Aborigine communities ( entirely funded by the government, some have about $80,000 per person per year spent on them) have massive<b>  alcohol</b>, child abuse and crime problems. There have been cases in some tribes where the elders hav<b> e sexua</b>l rights to all young women. A lot of people don't realise they get paid benefits from the government that come close to some peoples full time income. This allows them to not need to work which may sound great but it causes problems because a lot of them just drink and use drugs which once again leads to crime and child abuse. While this is a regularly the case I've also worked with several aborigines that work hard and are perfectly civil people. I think there's a better way to deal with this than throwing money at the problem because it really doesn't help.",

In these Australian states and territories, half-caste institutions (both government and\u00a0missionary) were established in the early decades of the 20th century for the reception of these separated children.\"\n\n\n\"The report closely examined the distinctions between \"forcible removal\", \"removal under threat or duress\", \"official deception\", \"uninformed voluntary release\", and \"voluntary release\".\u00a0The evidence indicated that in a large number of cases children were brutally and forcibly removed from their parent or parents,\u00a0possibly even from the hospital shortly after their birth.\u00a0Aboriginal Protection Officers often made the judgement on removal.\"\n\n\n\"In some cases, families were required to sign legal documents to relinquish care to the state. In Western Australia, the\u00a0Aborigines Act 1905\u00a0removed the legal guardianship of Aboriginal parents and made their children all legal wards of the state, so no parental permission was required\"\n\n\n\"In 1915, in\u00a0New South Wales, the\u00a0Aborigines Protection Amending Act 1915\u00a0gave the Aborigines' Protection Board authority to remove Aboriginal children \"without having to establish in court that they were neglected\"; it was alleged by Professor Peter Read that Board members sometimes wrote simply \"For being Aboriginal\" as the explanation when recording a removal\"\n\n\n\"In 1911, the Chief Protector of Aborigines in South Australia, William Garnet South, reportedly \"lobbied for the power to remove Aboriginal children without a court hearing because the courts sometimes refused to accept that the children were neglected or destitute\". South argued that \"all children of mixed descent should be treated as neglected\".\u00a0His lobbying reportedly played a part in the enactment of the\u00a0Aborigines Act 1911; this made him the legal guardian of every Aboriginal child in South Australia, including so-called \"half-castes\"\"\n\n\n\"The\u00a0Bringing Them Home\u00a0report also identified instances of official misrepresentation and deception, such as when caring and able parents were incorrectly described by Aboriginal Protection Officers as not being able to properly provide for their children, or when parents were told by government officials that their children had died, even though this was not the case.\"\n\n\n\"The report discovered that removed children were, in most cases, placed into institutional facilities...\u00a0Children taken to such places were frequently punished if caught speaking local indigenous languages, and the intention was specifically to prevent them being socialised in\u00a0Aboriginal cultures, and raise the boys as agricultural labourers and the girls as domestic servants.\"",

And as far as<b>  sexual</b> abuse in aboriginal communities goes, cite sources and compare them to other groups in Australia that hav<b> e sexua</b>l abuse statistics. Because i sure know alot of my friends who are non-indigenous who were sexually abused. and 80,000 per person per yr spent on them? where are you pulling these figures from? out of your ass!!! you are very wrong and you know you are wrong! following what government tells us? hahahahahaha the Australian government is known for lying to Australian citizens, its a well known fact!",

In that sense Terra Nullius was technically correct since the existing Aboriginal populations made no claims to ownership. They were occupiers, not proprietors.\u00a0\n\n\nBesides which, the government has a claim based on the same reason it has a claim to any authority - consensus. Most people think that Australia should be run by the government, so it runs the country by the consent of the people. That's how all forms of government work. You can't rule unless everybody else is willing to go along with it.\n\n\nThere's also the issue that you can't give the country back to the aboriginal people because there is no aboriginal people. There are hundreds of different groups which have moved around and mixed together with no <b> common </b>governing structure or body capable of being in charge. Australia simply could not exist now without all of the non-aboriginal people and the government and infrastructure they brought with them. \n\nUnfortunately ownership by right of conquest or claims based on 'discovery' were and are considered valid. You don't have to like it, but it's just the way it is because it happened hundreds of years before any of us was born and it's too late to do anything about it now. Besides, the fact that you can have this discussion on a computer instead of living hand to mouth using paleolithic tools, having a life expectancy of less than 40 and relying on<b>  nothing</b> more than hope to keep you from dying of some easily preventable disease has to count for something, right?",

Aboriginal people inhabited the land, but by their own cultural standards didn't own it. In fact it sounds like I have a better grasp of Australian history than you do. Terra Nullius was wrong in the sense that it was unethical, and the things that were done were horrible, but it was also an accurate assessment of the status of the country and frankly, if the British hadn't claimed it, some other European power would have and without the vast amounts of wealth the British Empire was able to invest Australia would have wound up like Africa. I'm not trying to justify it, because through a modern lens it's unjustifiable, I'm just saying that you should judge people by the standards of the context that they live in and by the standards of 18th century Europe, colonization was not only allowable, but actually encouraged. The people who did it believed at the time that they were doing the right thing by bringing technology and civilization to new lands while serving their king and country. They didn't arrive believing themselves to be an evil conquering army, they didn't view it as an invasion, they viewed it as the inevitable march of progress.",

This clip is closer to the latter in tone. <b> Nobody </b>disputes the shabby treatment given to aboriginal Australians, but many dispute the context in which it is placed. Is the establishment of a penal colony really the same as an invasion? Were the Eora (in the Sydney area) treated better or worse than the mostly white convicts? Is the 'Stolen Generation' (Aboriginal children taken from their parents) worse than the much larger number of white children (the Forgotten Generation) also taken from their parents for their 'protection'. Were the Stolen Generation raised only to be servants and labourers? (Some were, but many are successful people and, while resenting they were taken from their biological family, have<b>  nothing</b> but praise for foster parents who gave them a loving upbringing.) Foreigners often also tend to project their home grown ideas o<b> f racis</b>m onto Australia. One of my Aboriginal friends who did a study tour of the USA felt a lot of affinity with American Indians, but not wi<b> th Afric</b>an Americans (\"Mate, we certainly have issues, but we're just not as angry as that\".) It's a much, much more complex issue than this clip (mis)represents. A failure to explore that complexity in its fullness is one of the main barriers to its resolution.",

To me, if a kid did the crime they should do the time. So, you're relating me to the mind of a psychopath because I don't conform to this ceremonial-like empathy? This whole, \"We're sorry day\" only amplifies empathy and no real action. If you really care you would go beyond this amplified empathy.

What kinda moron are you? 1970s is modern times and it's just recently years , just few decades ago and the people of 1970s are indeed related to people of today, whites of 1970s are still alive and they have produced the generation of today...just proves that when people or whites of 1970s were cruel then whites of today must also be cruel....white immoral DNA will not change",

It was a perfect tactic for the british empire. That is why you see people from India, in Trinidad and Tobago, Belize, Fiji and Singapore. In many cases the local population are minorities or were erradicated. Much older expamples are the people from Northern Ireland, that came from Scotland, till this day they do not want to be part of Ireland.",

Some prefer to live in remote communities where it can be more comforatable and they have less people to deal with, which is absolutely fine, but that means that the government slacks on providing them resources to keep their communities, educated, healthy, connected to the internet and safe, because they are so remote, and Australia is so big, the government is trying really hard to deport all the communities into the cities on the coast, so they don't have to pay for all that stuff to be delieviered to the remote communities. If you are American, imagine Los Angeles supplying thousands of people on the east coast with all the resources they need, it's super expensive to go great distances for everything...Still, Most people, including me, think that the government should still pay the money, because if the Aboriginals want to live on their land, they have every right to, and since we are paying Tax, we want some of our Tax to be spent on keeping them connected and healthy as much as us.",

I'm from a minority (I'm white native English) and I wish I was joking, but I am not. In the last census here we became the first <b> nation </b>state in history to have it's indigenous population fall into the<b>  ethnic</b> minority class. Shame, sad but true.\nI'm always interested in people and places and never stop banging on about the promotion of native languages and culture. We English are a minority in britain. But our language is worldwide. \nIt's my opinion, all languages should he promoted. People can know many (there is factual proof that it raises people's intelegence). That is why I always back indigenous peoples, always! But as I hear from you, there are some that are liberty takers.... Once again thanks, I like to know details so I can see the bigger picture.",

Oh and before you say anything else lets not forget America During the 50's and 60's where <b> racism </b>in america was really heating up with story's like Emit Till, Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the various Sit Ins and Freedom Rides, treated so badly they had to fight back with silent protest and fight for their own civil rights and you only signed the Civil Rights Act in 1964 which wasn't that long ago and still today you still have problems with police officers and minorities especially with the<b>  African</b> american population. So before you start saying things like \"Australia is <b> a Racis</b>t Country\" you might want to look back at your own Country<b> 's Raci</b>st Pass because its the uneducated ones that follow the norm and believe what people say to them and have a one track mind, just like you.",

How many aboriginals are represented in your media? right less than 1% These are all current issues. As to your recent problems, raping aboriginal women and taking their children by force to be raised in 'white' culture to be your servants 1900-1970's aka stolen generation. Australia murdered numerous aboriginals as well.ie. myall creek massacres etc.\u00a0\n\nThe point of this particular video is, Australian white culture is <b> racist </b>and actively shit to its indigenous citizens.

What happens to the millions of people who are now refugees. how do you make the 90% of aboriginal peoples that are settled nomadic. How do you remove the infrastructure of the last 200 years.\n\n\nabove is the rest option, another option is aboriginal peoples taking over government but how. does every tribe elect a leader of which some tribes never had others no longer exists. How does a president (Australia couldn't stay part of the commonwealth is why i say\u00a0president)  work, with Australia never being unified as far as we know before European settlement. Does 97% of the population lose the right to vote or do you make it that only aboriginal peoples are allowed on the ballot papers.\n\n\nI'm just scratching the surface of how <b> crazy </b>hand back Australia to the original inhabitants would be it might have been possible 20 years into the colonization but not now. We have to deal with the ways things are now. The governments of recent history are trying to fix the mess that colonization brought but giving the land back isn't going to fix the last 200 years.",

How dare you stereotype us all,  I have been working since I left highschool,  and I bought my own house, and yes I know there is a problem,  but what have you or your family done to try and improve thing's for us Aboriginals?!

Aboriginals may statistically have lower IQ's but they were never born to be stupid. If he's going to throw that \"they only invented a stick for 40,000 years\", its because of the circumstances of the environment they live in. Australia is a harsh place. It would be hard for a human to invent a lot of things from scratch over there. Not to mention, there was little trade with outsiders so that's why they never got to build a civilization.

Furthermore, the American civil war wasn't even started because of slavery, it began because the confederacy was being mistreated by the Union, and even then the only reason why Abraham Lincoln gave Africans and African-americans freedom was because the Union needed troops and he had to think up something that would interest the slaves.\n\n\nfinally, thanksgiving day happened before the USA was even a country, and it's real meaning is thanks for the harvest and the past year, not making peace with Native Americans.",

Europe was just in the right situation at the right time for a handful of people to go colonize the new and some of the <b> old </b>world, and in the process cause horrible deaths and diseases.\nWhat to blame is not whites or any other<b>  race</b>, but the curiosity, population growth, and the greed of humankind to enslave thousands.\nAny othe<b> r rac</b>e could've done the same as the Spaniards, Portuguese, English, and to lesser extents Dutch and French did the same to native populations, if they had the right tools ad the same situation.\nThere was a slave that would've enslaved the slaver if given the chance and reason if he had not suffered as a slave. There was a aborigine or Native American that would've conquered Spain if the roles were reversed.\nBlame humanity not the white man, blame greed, selfishness a<b> nd raci</b>sm.

Their guns were also ineffective against the spears.\n\n15months after the whites had first arrived in Australia, they were desperately waiting for supplies & in serious danger of being taken down by the natives, then suddenly a pox disease hit the native colony across the harbour, a distance that is still today over 40 minutes by boat to get to. The pox disease wiped out 90% of those in that area & spread throughout the Sydney basin, taking out between 50 & 70% of the natives, while not effecting anyone in the colony. The origins are known from Banks journals as he was returning & documenting less & less natives as he got closer to the colony. Presumably if he had known the cause, he wouldn't have made these records, no other records were made (or they were made & destroyed)\n\nWe still try to deny what happened there, try to claim the disease got there some other way, try to claim the pox was chicken pox spread by a man with shingles (despite the distance & not a single child in the colony where he was living fulltime getting chicken pox) The surgeon's supply list makes it pretty clear what really happened - in his supplies were a jar of smallpox scabs! It's pretty clear that someone high up in the colony ordered those scabs be used as biological warfare & released a safe distance from the colony to wipe out all resistance from the native people.\n\nOne day, we as a<b>  nation</b> will grow up enough to acknowledge our past & maybe even have a discussion as to what the reasons/justifications in their eyes may have been. Very sad that we can't even recognise what we did, let alone take responsiblity for it",

So at the same time we should help them. But  you're right that we should not shame people for what their ancestors did. Also not every American or Australian Oh whatever country  citizen would fall under this having ancestor that did any wrong. As how many Asian Americans had oppressed Native Americans. I doubt majority  of Americans have had ancestors who were involved with harming Native Americans as most have ancestors that came after that like Italian and most German and Irish along along with Asians and Middle Eastern to name a few.",

They didn't massacre eachother, they didn't set bounties on eachothers heads and kill women and children. They did not colonise eachothers land and displaced eachother into so called resorvations. The Europeans did. I hope you do realise that Aboriginal tribes also killed eachother. Have you heard about the Maori? Still the Australians have a National Sorry day.

Like with the Huns and the Vikings, the America (and 13 colonies before that) that committed the genocide against native Americans is dead. You can't hold that America accountable for that genocide because it doesn't exist anymore, the America that exists now is notably different, though it shares a name.

And it would make a great difference, if only in attitude, considering the atrocities in America were much greater than even the ones committed in Australia. The US did give a half-assed apology in 2009, but it was buried deep in a bill of unrelated topics. Most US citizens still have no idea the magnitude of the atrocities committed against Natives, and a \"Sorry Day\" would bring attention to those historical injustices that were committed  still have an enormous effect on the lives of nearly all Native Americans (at least those who live on reservations) in the USA today. Keep in mind, Native Americans were nearly wiped out by genocide brought on them by Europeans and their plight was only exacerbated by the US Gov. If someone like Christopher Columbus can have a national holiday in the USA, it should go without question that the people who survived a genocide and had their land forcefully stolen from them by the USA so that the <b> nation </b>could exist should get at least some recognition.

Your statement harkens of a reading from the 1933 version of Encyclopaedia Britannica. There have been many waves of immigrants to this country since that time - it is no longer a British Colony. As far as committing genocide upon the Aboriginals - it would have to be the least successful genocide in British history - they were usually much more efficient.\n\n\nHad genocide been their aim - Australian Aborigines would now be consigned to dusty pages of history Much effort and monies were and still are being expended on behalf of helping Aboriginal Australians to enter the 21st Century. It is a particularly difficult undertaking to bring what was very recently a hunter/gatherer civilization up to the speed of an advance<b> d alie</b>n culture. I do agree - Australia and Australians are unique - all Australians.Thank you for recognizing that.",

They also recieve a lot of benefits we don't because they face challeneges we don't. They are prone to a lot more health issues than whites, blacks, asians, etc., so they get slightly better health care; things such as that, to try and help them live good quality lives. A lot of people just hear about the things they do get over the rest of the population, without looking into statistics and reasons why, so a lot of unfair and bias information gets shared. That's not to say there isn't a problem with a number of aboriginals taking advantage of extra treatment they get, but it happens pretty frequently in the white population too.\n\nSorry this is long and no one probably cares, but I'd like foreigners to understand that our natives aren't as awful as a lot of people try and make them out to be.",

You need to be careful with what you say or else you could find 50 million people snapping at your heals accusing you of everything horrible but the Spanish Inquisition.  I see that you've learnt your lesson when it comes to people who take things the wrong way, so the best advice I can give you is this: Speak to those as you yourself wish to be spoken too.  If you take the moral high ground in any argument, and calmly point out what you were saying without resorting to anger, anything else people spit against you only proves that they evolved from the lower end of the spectrum.  Don't forget, Trolls love to get people hot and bothered just for the hell of it.",

Is it that your ancestors may have evolved into humans in another place, but that your culture & who you are only began when you connected to this land? Is it that your ancestors came here as Denisovan & only evolved into homosapians after arriving here (science hasn't found anything to really suggest that yet, but it seems possible to me) or were their possibly some sort of apes here in the past not yet found, or am I totally clueless & if so, are you able to explain it to me, or am I just too clueless to grasp it?",
