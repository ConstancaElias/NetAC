There were more scholarships available to women only and my secondary supervisor actually admitted to me that she only recruits female applicants. Interestingly, the 4 male students, myself included worked longer hours in the lab, had less support yet produced all the first-author publications. We spoke about science in our spare time because we were extremely passionate about our subjects and technology in general. The women hardly ever spoke about science, most of the chat in the female dominated PhD office was about clothes,  lunch and who each <b> woman </b>was currently dating.",

Are men not 'welcome' in those fields (as she states women feel when it comes to the likes of Physics).  A study conducted in 2011/2012 by the higher education statistics authority found that out of 18 categories of subject, only 5 had more men than women in them (with engineering and computer science having the largest gap) - however the overall split of men vs women across all science subjects was 50.7 : 49.3 (i.e. slightly in favour of women).  It seems that women are very much engaging in science - but are choosing subjects other than physics, engineering and computer science (in much the same was as they choose not to be refuse collectors, miners etc).  The overall split across all subjects was 60.2 : 39.7 in favour of women which shows that if the education system is failing anyone - it's failing men and boys.....unfortunately such results don't pander to the feminist narrative that women are downtrodden and overlooked.",

                    "commentText": "@Cory Mck I read that study the article mentions.\n\nSeems the negative bias against resumes with female names was the same regardless of the professor's <b> gender,</b><b>  age</b>, discipline, or tenure status. In fact, it highlighted an important point: the people that were more likely to rate females lower for competency, hireability, mentoring, and salary were the people who interacted with students on a regular basis.\n\nCould it be that the reason they were rated lower was because those who interacted with students more were able to tell that qualifications of paper weren't the same as experiences they've personally had with people. Even though everyone rated likeability for females higher across the board, they don't seem to think they're as competent even with the same qualifications.\n\nIt may be that male and female professors have had better experiences with male students throughout their academic careers, something which would not be found by looking at identical resumes. Might it be that since they interact with students they've seen disparities between male and female grades and how intelligent, motivated, etc. they are in person from having conversations with them. Might it be that this bias isn't necessarily rooted i<b> n sexis</b>m and instead due to them noticing biological differences, where males are more willing to work longer hours, take more risks, be more aggressive, etc. That would mean that equally qualified males and females on paper are in fact not equally qualified in reality.\n\nA personal anecdote I have for this is recently I did a job that required a lot of running around delivering and moving stuff and then being on standby when things needed to get done. I ended up running around, moving items, and delivering things noticeably more than the females. In fact a female brought this up in a gathering saying that I did far more work than her or any others that day. We both had the same job description and requirements and we could put the same thing on a resume yet those that experienced the workers that day would notice a disparity of labour where men did more work. We were being paid the same, too, so there wasn't any monetary incentive to do more work. I've noticed this same disparity in many of the jobs I've had where men just outwork women on average. I would figure those professors that worked with students would notice this same disparity and this would be reflected in how they rate males and females.\n\nOn top of all of this and to end it, I've read other studies and seen videos referencing these studies that show females are more likely to be hired as a percentage of the<b> ir gend</b>er that submitted resumes than males. If there were 20 females and 80 males going after the job, a higher percentage of those females would be hired with respect to the males.",

Part of the environment that shapes us is social, which stems quite heavily from genetics anyway so I'd go with that.\n\nI'm trying to think of an analogy for that. Something about the seed being genetics, so no matter where an acorn is planted it's going to grow into an oak tree. The environment changes a decent numbers of properties but the most important and crucial ones for it being an oak tree are from its seed.\n\nWell ... this analogy is actually just a specific example. Not sure if that makes it a bad or a good analogy. Haha.",

Truth is, the proclivity to learn some things (at least differently) is easier for a male while others are easier for a female. I do find it funny how the chic in the video kept referring to feelings (that is, they are important to females).

Its simple really, not sexist in any way, I'm just trying to explain that women don't really have a great outlook on the sciences, and we should change that.

Men and women are not that different on an intelligence level for sure ( I think a study had men  couple of IQ points above women on average - but pretty negligible). Studies do show that most women tend to huddle around IQ averages than men, whereas men vary greatly on the IQ scale, which is why the geniuses of our society are mostly men but also most dumbasses are men as well.\n\n\nBut men and women do have different strengths and weaknesses as genders, and the compliment each other quite well.  Men tend to gravitate towards jobs with more money and more dangerous work, while women tend to gravitate towards jobs that is more fulfilling to them personally.  Men and Women have different outlooks on life - there is <b> nothing </b>wrong with this at all.  That is what Milo is saying, he is not calling women stupid, far from it.  He is pointing out women make different life choices to men.  I am sure they are choices that feminists hate, but they are CHOICES - isn't that what feminism is all about - for women to make their own choices.  And they generally don't choose Science and Maths as careers.",

That's oppressive!! That's <b> patriarchy!</b>! That's manspreading!! We must fight that till it is erased from the society!!\" Yep, feminism is totally legit in its argument and activism //rolls eyes//\n\nAnd regarding this video, Dr. Grossman herself supports Tim Hunt's statement, even though she doesn't realise it and she actually thinks she's arguing against him. She says that women in general are \"more sensitive\" and more prone to crying. She even admitted she cried after her exams in Cambridge, in which she scored higher than most of her male colleagues. She also stressed how the STEM \"environment\" must be changed to better suit female \"sensitivity\". Basically, she just shot herself in the foot and unwittingly agreed with Tim Hunt's statements.",

And in this case, Dr. Grossman isn't even an authority on<b>  gender</b> an<b> d sexis</b>m. She's a molecular biologist. So it's not even an argument from authority; it's what I'd call The Argument from FALSE Authority.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's see what Milo and Dr. Grossman are saying. Dr. Grossman states that women are disadvantaged in pursuing STEM fields. Milo countered by saying that in college, women are outperforming men on average. Not only that, there are more women enrolling in colleges and universities than men. Here's a short link on that:\n\n [LINK] \n\nThis is an unprecedented trend in history. You'd think that with so many women enrolling in college, their collective strength would force the so-called \"sexist\" STEM fields to open up to the new and vast market of potential female workforce. But NO!! Women are not flocking to STEM fields, except for biology and medicine:\n\n [LINK] ",

            "commentText": "I think this article sums up Milo as well as this argument quite nicely: \n'Yiannopoulos is arguing that men's and women's brains are different, and men are intrinsically better at the science stuff. But Yiannopoulos is a college dropout, twice over, has no background in science at all (just like he has no background in gaming, either, but then no amount of ignorance will stop him from plowing on). It's not clear what he studied in college, but it seems to have been journalism or English, not science. His male brain seems to be trained in muckracking, lying, and hackery.\n\nMeanwhile, here's the female brain of Dr Emily Grossman:\n\nI am an expert in molecular biology and genetics, with a Triple First in Natural Sciences from Queens' College Cambridge and a PhD in cancer research. I also trained and worked as an actress and I now combine my skills in my work as a science communicator and broadcaster; explaining science for a wide range of TV and radio programmes and at live events. I teach all three science subjects and maths at all academic levels (I have taught in two London schools and tutored over 180 private students) and I also work as a freelance communication skills trainer.\n\nI suspect that Mr Yiannopoulos is overcompensating. He's an ignoramus, but if he yells loud enough about men's brains he gets to pretend he's scientifically inclined, as a side-effect of having a penis.'

Norway has a scientific history that goes back centuries. Although Bangladeshi women face enormous disadvantages in virtually all spheres of life compared to Norwegian women, one thing they do not face is being raised to perceive science as a male gendered profession, since very few people of either <b> gender </b>have pursued science in any depth until recently. There simply aren't generations of notable male Bangladeshi professors who have come before them.\n\nHe doesn't even grasp that he's making Emily Grossman's point that the cultures of these countries have led to different expectations.",

All I can guess is either a) he was, since being publicly shamed, under a lot of pressure to say something. I doubt he knew what. Or b) he's speaking anecdotally from his own experiences. May or may not be true. Either way, the whole thing was blown way out of proportion.\n\n\nThis is how I, and many others, see it:\n\nApparently the audience understood it was a joke. Some journalist takes offence, removes any contextual meaning, and sparks moral outrage over the entire thing. Quite farcical really.\n\nDoes the crime match the \"punishment\" (i.e. public humiliation, effectively leading to he resignation) in this case? In my opinion no.\n\nFeel free to disagree :)",

Or the amount going for their RN rather than pre-med. Or with Feminists, how many go into Womens' Studies. One of my ex-girlfriends actually got an engineering degree, then became a stay at home mother. Yet somehow, it couldn't possibly be womens' choices... because almost 500 years ago, girls got told their brains were too soft and exercising their brains would shrink their ovaries. Even though women are independent, strong, and powerful, these comments were too damaging for them to overcome and break into the STEM fields, even with over a century of Feminism fighting for them.\u00a0\n\nMakes sense to me.",

            "commentText": "She made no sense at all. I wasn't able to count how many contradictions I've heard in her speeches. The worse thing was when she simply stated that ''girls are going to do worse (and she actually says that it has been shown they do, like there was a study proving it officially, without any numbers or methodology manipulation) when they recognize and identify themselves as females in tests/exams, because they self-reflect themselves and think they're going to fail''. WHERE IS THE LOGIC ON THIS? I couldn't process this on my mind, cuz it's simply one of the most ridiculous and nonsense thing I've ever heard in my life It's basically saying that women are extremely emotional and unable to think for themselves while facing the slightest disadvantage or difficulty. PURE VICTIMHOOD AND OPPORTUNISM HERE.\nBased on her arguments, she openly affirms that women are being disencouraged and not receiving enough support as they should because they ''feel'' diminished, not welcome, afraid, rejected. <--- Which means either they create this idea, this hallucination on their minds that they aren't mentally prepared to face LIFE with their own strenght and intelect, therefore lacking any kind of resilience or endurance towards of pression and tension whatsover or that women are fragile and need, as he says, ''extreme special care around them''. Which also means that women AREN'T worthy or capable to follow science carrers, specially the ones men dominate (its not a coincidence), and if they're not being handed everything, they can't stand for a qualification and competence's competition (which is how the freakin working market works) BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE OR PREPARED.\n\nEquality? Seriously, this is total BULLSHIT. Our generation is the most whiny, <b> fuzzy </b>and pathetic one in humanity's history. People are completely denying the idea of individuality and throwing away what merit and effort are there for, forgetting that everyone has their own situations and circumstances, all for the sake and good of ''political correctness''.\nAnd the most hilarious thing about all this, is that she doesn't realize she's being extremely hypocrite, lacking<b>  common</b> sense, logic and coherence. She destroys herself in her own arguments. Fact is, she's trying to argue against facts.\nWomen are the majority on schools and universities over men in developed countries and have different carrer/profession choices, because men and women differ almost entirely, biologically speaking, encompassin<b> g menta</b>l and physical aspects/factors. Men dominate some areas, while women dominate other areas, AND THAT'S IT.\n\nI'm done.",

            "commentText": "They both raise valid points but I don't think either of them have really reached a final rational conclusion. At certain levels women are disadvantaged and at certain levels men are disadvantaged. Girls don't want to go into STEM as often as men and their own limiting beliefs do negatively affect their performance as Dr. Grossman notes. It may be beneficial to identify where they are hearing these messages and educate them so that they do not accept them personally. Still, nowadays they get into college more easily, do better at school, get jobs more easily and are paid better up until they are in their 30s like Milo says.If they can get past their own doubts they will do better and that actually suggests they may currently have a bigger real advantage and their biggest disadvantage is in fact their own beliefs.\n\nWould accommodating women's different style perhaps by reducing competitiveness benefit women and reduce their doubts? Perhaps, but that also means that it may negatively affect men and this actually would be a rational reason to segregate them professionally to some degree. Would this be economically, socially, and politically advantageous on balance? It's impossible to say.\n\nAre men simply more naturally adept due to their biology in certain areas? Perhaps, but the science is still out. Are women more naturally inclined to pursue other interests? Perhaps, but the science is still out. It is not enough to point out that in certain cultures where women have more freedom, financial equity, or however Milo is defining \"more equality,\" they choose not to enter STEM. There may be plenty of biases in these cultures that still subtly suggest that STEM is not as feminine or there may be other legitimate social costs for a <b> woman </b>entering STEM. But given women's evolutionary role there is certainly some credibility to the idea that women's brains are different and that they may be naturally drawn towards careers whose tasks reflect those roles such as those that engage in more caregiving and empathizing. This cannot be discounted on some philosophical notion that men and women are equal simply because they can still be equal in value but have different tendencies and aptitudes.\n\nAre there stereotypes that discourage women from pursuing STEM degrees? At least in the US I think so, but what are they proposing is done about it? Milo makes a good point in that it should be an individual decision to make when determining what they really want to pursue and the onus is on them to make an assessment of their own capabilities just like every man must. Even if men truly were more capable in STEM professions, there is enough variability that that alone should not rule out all women. But some still will rule themselves out. Again, where are these messages coming from and how can we curb them? I would suggest identify the sources and educate.\n\nAre women more likely to cry? As it is, sure, but let them cry and deal with it appropriately. Don't give them special treatment whenever they cry. \u00a0Let them experience and express their emotions healthily. Maybe men need to learn ways to better handle other people experiencing their emotions without needing to get them to stop or being so uncomfortable that it affects their ability to work and treat them as they would any other co-worker. This probably will also greatly help men who have a tendency to cry and probably experience even more negative emotions surrounding it like shame since it's unmanly. Maybe women (and men who cry so to speak) need better ways to manage their own emotions, to learn to tolerate criticism without becoming overwhelmed by their emotions, and to not expect special treatment when they do cry (and by this I am not excluding a mature, empathetic response), and learn how to move forward when it does happen. So, I think it's important to identify these things, educate and train rather than broadly painting one<b>  gender</b> as the victim and the other as the oppressor, or by giving special privileges to one over the other. The goal should be integration of traditional as well as continually changin<b> g gende</b>r differences in an evolving world.\n\nBut on top of all this I think what was said and what is being debated are two wildly different things. I don't think there is anything necessarily irresponsible with Sir Tim Hunt stating his own beliefs in the way that he put them and it only hurts the case being put forward to get distracted by it and reject it outright because it doesn't sound like the ideal envisioned by activists trying to get women more involved in STEM. Certainly, the dialogue has been opened up by his off-the-cuff remarks. And in any case, it's not necessarily an ineffective idea to segregate. It hasn't been shown one way or another that it is. Then again, I think it's reasonable to believe that there are other less drastic measures we can attempt to solve any problems that arise due <b> to gend</b>er differences in the work place before resorting to segregation of any kind given it's sordid history.\n\nBesides,\u00a0I don't think what he says reflects the belief that women are less capable in STEM. He isn't saying that no women should enter STEM at all. But until people are educated and trained, until they have the skills to handle these differences there is likely some truth to his assertions that work place romances and a perceived inability to handle criticism affects overall productivity. In the e<b> nd, nob</b>ody will have the opinion to speak that women and men should have separate work spaces because they will be used to working with one another effectively, women will no longer hold themselves back with negative beliefs about their own potential, probably bec<b> ause no</b>body will be parroting that message anyway and the battle of the sexes will be waged on a different battlefield.",

Furthermore, so what if only 20% of physics students are female, for example I was one of the only males who did Food Tech at GCSE, why is that not considered a crisis. People have their preferences, if women want to take other subjects then let them. As Milo said, the structures that was previously stopping women decades ago has been worked out of the system and the vast majority of feminists that argue otherwise just don't see the system that is in place today in 2018",

So they can't know that it will be social or not social enough for them. They are simply dropping out and studying other things because... That's what they're doing. \npeople have freedom to choose what they want to invest their time in. \ufeffa lot more women are going into law than previously. At the expense of the sciences.\nNow, should we be telling women that they can't go into law anymore and instead must go into science? If they are going to invest all that time in law school, and aren't dropping out its probably  what they want to do with their lives. And that's ok. People can choose what they want to study. Simple as that. \nIf more women study law, then fewer will be in science. \ufeffif more go into nursing they don't also go into physics.",

I don't know if its due to immigration of male nurses overseas or domestic males increase in interest. Nevertheless, there is actually a silent promotion for males to go into nursing and trust me I know - I am a male nurse.\n\nHow is pushing women into STEM going to decrease women in Nursing ? There are other areas where we could transfer women into STEM like for example, there are a lot of women in business, social sciences and teaching that I think should go into STEM. There are already an too much teachers whether male or female and reducing these extra teachers could be helpful in promoting those females to go into STEM. So no, I don't think it's going to affect a lot.\n\nPeople's interests change. It's not absolute at all and is very fluid. And also at the end of day the interests of individuals have to be aligned in some way to the interests towards the economy and cultural development. <b> Gender </b>segregation in job sectors is bad for the economy and culturally we have to evolve to be motivated towards tasks that we might otherwise have found uninterested before. As human beings, genders have to evolve and start learning to share the same tasks.",

The feminist there is saying she is against what the <b> old </b>guy (Tim) said but she then goes on to say the same things.\n\nShe says girls are more sensitive (Tim said they cry easily.) Same thing.\n\nHe said girls should be separated from boys, presumably so boys and girls perform in different environments. She thinks environment in science fields should be more nurturing, supporting, etc. so girls feel alright. Well, the if men perform better in competitive environment, they should not be forced into a feminine, 'nurturing' environment. Only solution is<b>  gender</b> segregation to provide environment appropriate for eac<b> h se</b>x. Both are basically implying the same thing.\n\nShe also rejects Milo's claims about boys and girls being naturally diff, hence boys doing better in science. Yet she goes on with biological generalizations about women.\n\nShe is very confused and contradicting herself at every point.\n\nHere's what I think: In the UK (and the west in general), unis and workplaces are desperate to hire women to showcase their 'equality'. This gives women an unfair advantage. There's no institution<b> al sexi</b>sm driving women away.\n\nHowever, I do think that women might do better in a less cut throat, competitive environment. It is up to them to create such an environment. If that involves segregation and actually improves female participation, success in sciences, I wouldn't be against it at all. But I don't see how exactly segregation would work - it would be full of inconveniences. Still, it remains a fact that men have an advantage over women in sciences/maths because of being overrepresented at higher end of IQ distribution and being less risk averse.",

Why is this the case? \n\na) Jealousy\nb) For the same reason that kidnapping victims often come to defend their captor. Humans have a desire for familiarity. Some women thus may find it difficult to \"go against the grain\" and speak up against a man, in support of her fellow <b> woman.</b>\n\n2. The man repeatedly tries to put Dr. Emily into an \"inept, vengeful female\" box. He can't fathom that a female is able to have emotions, meanwhile put them aside in order to rise to the top. This is quite ignorant, though. Often behind a successful women is a girl who once learned the consequences of romance and distractions.

Where are all the women in the IT industry now? They decided to do other things instead of spending all night on the computer growing up. They studied <b> gender </b>studies or became a mom or went in to another female dominated industry. They have no excuse anymore, in fact we see the opposite now, women are encouraged in to these industries at the expense of men. Now when those same women change their minds or go to in to another industry we have a brain drain in that industry and then we all lose out as a society, all because some feminists hate men and want to encourage female supremacy all while claiming equality equality equality.",

Then I went to another student film set and the single male director accomplished more than both of the girls did and only had 1 moment where he got flustered because of equipment failure, but after 10 seconds of being emotional he brushed it off and starting trying to find solutions to the problem. \n\nI have had to work with a lot of girls in my department at school, yet only a handful would I trust to get the job done. I would trust those girls more than the average guy, but at the same time I would trust the laziest guy to do something faster and better than the average girl. \n\nNot sexist, just my experience",

It isn't fair that some men fail to make it into the military when they would have if they were being held to the same standards the women are. It also isn't fair we are sending young women to die because they pass tests that have ridiculously lower requirements than the men's do.",

Sweden still has culture stereotypes and beliefs about certain sectors even if there are no \"<b> gender </b>roles\".\n\nMy point wasn't about social<b>  gender</b> roles but the construct of STEM environments as non-social ones versus STEM in Asia where it has always been traditionally more social and open.",
