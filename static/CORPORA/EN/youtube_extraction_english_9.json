They like feeling like they're \"the man\" and having women as their \"property\" like an object and when women start taking over their jobs in society, they start to feel small because women already have so many abilities men don't. I believe nature intended us to have our part in our job like hunters and gatherers but when the hunter starts abusing the gatherer, the gatherer starts to want to go their own way and learn to hunt for themselves instead of being the hunter's slave. Women didn't start to want social equality until men took their authorities over women too far and constantly dehumanizing women became the norm. Women becoming independent today is the seed sew by abusive men in society. I think if men didn't dehumanize women so much, we'd all still be fine being the mother and homemaker, playing our part, but because they are abusive, we'd rather be independent instead of being slaves to men. The sad thing about this social development is the children born into this. Imagine your mother being an independent women having a high paying successful career but she's never around to spend time with you and teach you right from wrong and other things school can't teach. For a child, having a homemaker mother and career father is the most ideal, but overly abusive men dehumanizing women ruined that ideal family setting. My two cents.",

Long story short, my brother went to juvie when he was a teenager after causing hell in school and at home and only recently he was tamed by his awesome girlfriend who taught him what love was and has become a decent human being. If it weren't for her, he'd still be a major a**hole.\n\nThere are women who get greedy and want both children and a career but inevitably find themselves sacrificing one for the other and you know which, because bills don't pay themselves (unless they have a faithful hubby who respects them and fully support them) I personally would rather not have any kids unless I can guarantee them my full attention. While I came out okay, there are soooooo many cases where emotionally abandoned kids choose the wrong paths in life and my brother almost did, how do you think criminals are made? Children are all born innocent.\n\nI believe there are still men out there with integrity and who aren't misogynists; though less than ever. The previous few generations has spawn quite a lot of misguided kids with single moms or from dysfunctional families and with so many misleading sexist propaganda messages all over the net by older generation of sexists spreading hate, any young adult or teen would easily get brainwashed into believing them, thus fueling the <b> age </b<b> >old</b> war of the sexes, known as feminazis and masculinazi. This video is a good example of that, any misguided teenager would watch this and assume all men to be scum and young men would argue against this video and point out women as scum. I've came across many hateful propaganda videos right here on youtube promotin<b> g misogyn</b>y worst than this one and I was disgusted by all the sexist men in the comment section praising the video and adding their dehumanizing comments about women. I was so tempted to comment and argue against but realized, my input would only fuel the<b> ir bli</b>nd hateful obsessions. Like a quote by Mark Twain 'Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference.' Hate fuels hate and if you don't think before you speak, you'll end up joining the war of sexists without realizing (Both men and women) My first comment was only directed toward the sexist men in this very video.\n\nHate is born from ignorance, because it's easier to hate what you don't understand. Humans are imperfect beings and I believe some sexists will change once they are more experienced and educated. I'm no exception, I once did ignorantly think all men were scums because I was once misguided and the men in my life were just a**holes. Sorry for the long comment, it just came pouring out.\n\nP.S. Educate, don't join the army of hate.",

She had us while financially unprepared and while renting and didn't teach us anything and didn't show us any love, i'm talking about women like her. Women who selfishly have children for their own agenda and without thinking about the child's life and future.",

Second, early 20th century, WAS pretty wealthy...until the 30s. If you don't know what I'm referring to, then please don't accuse me of being ignorant. That statement is totally incorrect. Assuming you believe TED, I'd refer you to http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2000/Feb/wk3/art03.htm which shows the difference between 1950 (which is AFTER early 20th century, and still proves my argument) and 1998. One final thing. I never said that women in the 20th century DIDN'T work. That was never stated. Not once. Also, I don't get what on EARTH gave you the idea that America is no longer capitalist. Are you kidding me??? There is just as much, if not more, capitalism now than in the early 20th century. For example, think of just how much the industrial complex influences every part of out culture. Even on YouTube, how many independent channels are outviewed by things like Jimmy Fallon or John Oliver? And yes, I AM a liberal. God forbid I should have a differing political alignment than you. Learn to be more open to other people's ideology. P.S: Did the dude with \"I want to cum inside Rainbow Dash\" as part of his pic just accuse me of being a \"liberal scum\"??? Really? Bronies are supposed to be accepting of all others, aren't they? Christ.",

You know all those school dress codes saying that girls can't wear \"spaghetti straps\" and shorts have to be a certain length? Yeah, those are there because it creates a \"distracting\" learning environment for male students. Because we teach girls that we should change for men instead of telling men and boys to CONTROL their emotions. This teaches that men's education is of more priority than women's. Do you get it know? Men also get their emotions in a twist, maybe perhaps more than women. Don't use that excuse. We're all human beings.\nNow, before anyone starts with all that \"Not all men are like that!\" kind of thing, let me just tell you something.\nENOUGH ARE.",

Because men get longer jail sentences than women for the same crime. Because prison rape is found acceptable in comedies but not male on female rape (neither should be).

The homicide one is more complicated than you're making it out to be (women are far more likely to be murdered by someone close, and almost twice as much by an SO). I got <b> nothing </b>for the homeless one, but I don't see why this must be a gendered issue. End homelessness, not just (wo)men's homelessness.\n\nEverything from the sentencing to the blue collar job thing is a result of social<b>  gender</b> stereotypes feminism is trying to get rid of. So there's another reason to support feminism.\n\nHaven't heard the \"women and children first\" thing in a long fucking time. We all know it's outdated as fuck, and I haven't heard it used in decades.\n\nAny claims of false rape claim epidemics is a load of shit. Yes, it happens. My buddy was accused by his ex-boyfriend, and he hashed it out with the cops and settled the whole situation.\n\nAnd yes, look at the radicals. That's the best way to find out the basics of a movement. Look at the people you yourself have identified radicals.

It is very hard to not look at the radicals when they take up the majority of the movement. Put it this way, if a lot of people already hate the movement, what chances do they have of anyone supporting them? 3rd wave feminism is cancer. The \"women and children\" thing is still VERY relevant, if you believe that has disappeared you are misinformed.\n\nAnd why say you don't see how this has to be a gendered issue when your full argument is how women have it worse and why we need FEM inism, when Egalitarianism fights for you whether you're white/black, male/female,atheist/religious etc. Feminisms history is actually bound in <b> racism </b>and radicalism.

The second sentence proves you get most of your information on feminists from antifeminists. The answer to the third is (to put it in simple, yet bound to be misunderstood, terms) marketing. And the final one needs proof.\n\nOk, first half of the third paragraph: I was referring to homelessness specifically. Calm down. And you've also completely ignored me when I said that feminism is a necessary part of egalitarianism. It's a piece of the puzzle, as are racial equality, LGBTQ rights, rights for the <b> disabled,</b> etc. \"Feminism\" just kinda became the catch-all for<b>  gender</b> equality, because the notion that men are disadvantaged by these same systems that disadvantage women (albeit to a lesser degree) is a fairly new one.\n\nThe rest indicates that you need a history lesson.

            "commentText": "The <b> sexism </b>is there all right. But it's not in what is said. It's in what is worn: in the sexist attire that is so routine that it's INVISIBLE. It's passes for LIFE.\n\nThis is part of the denatured language of the women's movement that a radical hominism wants to deconstruct.\n\nWe can talk all we want about<b>  sexism</b> in the abstract, but if women keep dressing like that; if they keep exposing their legs and arms; if they keep adorning their bodies; if they affect pedomorphic, pediomorpihic, and theriomorphic presentative Otherness (i.e. as child, as doll, as animal, as in feline fingernails), all the pretentious nonsense abou<b> t sexis</b>m, as tendentiously defined by a reactionary feminism, will not change a thing in our society.\n\nBut the denatured language of the reactionary women's movement tries to avoid these far more difficult issues. Women prefer to attack images of femininity (implicitly blaming the men) than attack the real thing (explicitly blaming women).\n\nJust like the attack of that scientist's shirt. Women prefer to attack a scientist showing images of sexy cartoon women on his shirt, then attack real women in real life.\n\nThat's what a radical hominism means by the denatured language of feminism; and why it is not a discourse, with adequation to a real world, or correspondence to a real world, or at least reflecting a degree of coherence; but is instead an ideological language; ideology has a purpose but no real meaning.\n\nJust like accusing Donald Trump <b> of sexi</b>sm for callin<b> g a wo</b>man a slob, even though he called a man a slob too. Which proves that feminism has no real adequation, to no correspondence\u00a0 with, a real world, not even coherence; since it's incoherent to attack one use of slob but not another use of slob.\n\nIt's incoherent to attack a scientist wearing a shirt with scantily clad cartoon characters on it, but not attack women who dress like that in real life.\n\nIt's incoherent to attack a Trophy T-shirt marketed for women, but not attack women who behave like trophies in real life, that is<b> , as se</b>xual objects.\n\nEven the word \"object\" is glossed expediently, as part of a language, not a discourse. That is, it had tendentious or accusatory purpose, but no real meaning.\n\nThe opposite of \"object\" is \"subject\" in normal usage. If a person is not a subje<b> ct of s</b>exual relations, she has to be an object. Only in the obfuscatory illogical language of the women's movement is not being an ob<b> ject a </b>mental act rather than a behavioral practice.\n\nThat's why hominism calls feminism the t<b> hinkin</b>g woman's ideology: women prefer to THINK liberation rather than RISK liberation. It's easier to THINK it's wrong to be called a trophy than to risk not being a trophy by initiating a relationship with a man, asking him out, paying for the date, etc.\n\nIt's easier to THINK it's wrong<b>  to </b>be a sex object, but much harde<b> r to</b> be a sex subject. Logically one must be one or the other; there's the law of the excluded middle that the women's movement conveniently ignores.\n\nSo women create a false antithesi<b> s: b</b>eing a sex object and <b> not </b>being a sex object. But to women<b>  not</b> being a sex object means THINKING<b>  one</b> is not a sex object and perhaps ASSERTING it or writing articles about it.\n\nOtherwise female behavior does not c<b> hang</b>e. It's as old as the Second Wave women's movement: t<b> he man</b> asks the woman out; he pays for the dates; they become engaged; he proposes on one knee. Then she proclaims to all the world t<b> hat </b>she is not a sex object, not a trophy, and insists on being called Ms. and keeping her last name after marriage!\n\nThis kind of kindergarten radica<b> lism is </b>painless. Nothing really has changed. Because the language of feminism is denatured, removing all the issues from their NATURAL context.\n\nSo workplace issues are removed from their natural context<b> , denat</b>ured of the sexual status of women, and then equality is defined as equal opportunity and equal pay for equal work.\n\nMeanwhile, due to the denatured language o<b> f femin</b>ism, women's sexual status is unchallenged: she is<b>  sti</b>ll the exclusive sex object, which in a c<b> onsu</b>mer society means sex commod<b> ity;</b> men are still the sex subject; which in a consumer society means he finances relationships with women; and not only on dates, but often entire lifestyles of women.\n\nThe issues of harassment, catcalling and rape are similarly denatured by the women's movement and a false opposition with romantic courtship (dating, the dating game, etc.) when they are in fact CONTINUOUS practices of aggressive-passive behaviors that, when seen in their natural context are essentially predatory practices.\n\nThis much is apparent when dates end in date rape, clearly showing that the two practices are in fact continuous practices of predatory aggression only in one case the practice is sanitize<b> d and </b>controlled by the woman and in the other case it is controlled by the man.\n\nOne is institutionalized as \"normal\" and the other is criminalized as deviant; but in fact a radical hominism has shown their continuous relationship as predatory practices based on an aggressive-passive relationship that, in a consumer society, ultimately becomes sado-masochistic in forms such as prostitution, escort services, dating itself, which is ultimately a form of sado-masochism, etc.\n\nOtherwise the man who dates on Tuesday could not pay for an escort girl on Wednesday without being schizophrenic. Clearly the two pract<b> ices are re</b>lated for the transition to be made so easily from one to the other; from a date to an escort girl; from a date to date rape, etc.\n\nBut the denatured language of feminism has taken these practices out of their natural context; the way it has removed workplace issues from their natural contex<b> t (i</b>.e. women as financed sex objects outside of the workp<b> lace</b> and therefore seen as sex objects within the workplace, devalued as workers since perceived ultimately in their roles and status outside the workplace, etc.).\n\nTo put it practical<b> ly, ho</b>w can a man pay for a woman's bod<b> y Tues</b>day night then treat a woman as a peer in the workplace Wednesday morning? Why should he care about her wages when his wages go to supporting her\u00a0 or\u00a0 women like her, often for days, weeks, and (with serial dat<b> ing) e</b>ven years on end?\n\nSo a woman makes, hypothetically (and there is no proof for this, just women's claim) 90 cents on the dollar; even 80 cents. So she makes 80 dollars in the same period a man makes 100 dollars.\n\nSo the man spends 50 dollars on <b> a date</b> after his paycheck. The woman gets 50 dollars\u00a0 worth of food, entertainme<b> nt, et</b>c. on that date.\n\nNow the woman makes 130 dollars, while the man makes 30 dollars. Over months<b>  or ye</b>ars one can easily see the woman is making far more than the man<b> .\n\nBut</b> it doesn't stop there. The woman marries UP (women tend to mar<b> ry UP)</b>; the man marries DOWN.\n\nThe woman is now being supported by a greater income than she makes; the man is meanwhile diminishing his income with the barmaid with the long legs he married one drunken weekend.<b> \n\nThe </b>two couples get divorced. The woman gets a hefty settlement; the man surrendered a hefty part of his salary in alimony, or maybe child support, etc.\n\nKeep in mind this doesn't even factor in all the other expenses ran<b> dy m</b>ales pay for escort girls, phone sex, prostitutes, financed extra-marital relationships, etc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe goal of a radical hominism is once again to situate a genuine discourse (not a mere id<b> eologic</b>al or tendenti<b> ous </b>language) of gender within NATURAL SEX relations, which still, despite all the claims of change, im<b> plie</b>s women as attractive and lucrative sex objects and men as mere consumers of those objects.\n\nFo<b> r a rad</b>ical hominism this impacts all of gender relationships, morphing from a presentative female as Other (exhbiitionism, female practices of passivity, allure, pedomorphism, pediomorphism, theriomorphism, \"samplin<b> g\" (th</b>e provocative exposure of part of a woman's fetishized i.e. contoured, exaggerated, painted, exposed body in order to effect the sale of the rest) to an ultimately sado-masochistic exchange represented in exploitative practices of dominance a<b> nd s</b>ubmission (abusive husbands, rape, the sex trades, the dating game, marriage itself with its hefty financial settlements, etc.).\n\nThe reactionary nature of the women's movement, exposed by a radical hominism, is seen in the way women are concerned about gendered toys for children but not about gendered attire.\n\nThe reason must be that women want to impinge upon male power, but<b>  the</b>y do not want to l<b> ose </b>their traditional sex<b>  pow</b>er, that is, as sex object and ultimately sex commodity with all the economic benefits that go along with it.\n\nThis is why a denatured language of feminism, with a denatured focus on the workplace, catcalls, equal pay for equal work, and even rape, has failed. Because these issues cannot be addressed, and hence resolved, within a denatured framework but only if they are address<b> ed w</b>ithin a coherent and adequate discourse of sex role play at all levels of society, including the passive practices of women in courtship and the mirrored aggressive practices of men.\n\nOne sees this in the way that women assert (with good reason) that date rape is a serious issue, but then mock the idea<b>  of da</b>te prostitution! But what else i<b> s it i</b>f a woman assumes the man must pay for the woman he goes out with? It must be called prostitution if one uses language correctly.\n\nJust like women insist that date rape is still rape, so date prostitution is still prostitution. The fact that rape occurred during a date doesn't mean it's<b>  not r</b>ape; the fact that the man paid money for a woman on a date doesn'<b> t me</b>an it's not prostitution. Nor is the fact that sex necessarily occurred on that particular date si<b> gnif</b>icant; because obviously ultimately the goal is sex, whether on that date or several dates l<b> ater</b> that month or even many months later, as in the old days.",

This is what opponents cleverly ignore when they refer to women as victims, knowing that no-one wants to be seen as helpless.

It's why so many poorer people think it's such a GREAT idea to cut billionaire taxes while cutting food stamps and other programs to help the poor.  GOP economics have failed in Kansas, WI, and NJ, yet still people are convinced of the lie that slashing taxes for the rich at the expense of the poor is a great idea, because Fox \"News\" propaganda and lies encourages them to hate Dems.  The most ironic thing: they consider themselves the \"most\" Christian!",

Character should define a person, not their assigned<b>  gender</b> at birth or the color of your skin. Men get generalized and called out, too, an<b> d sexis</b>m in general is just so incredibly stupid. Did you know that in t<b> he o</b>ld days, people use to worry that females couldn't separate fact from fiction and feared that showing them plays and stories would lead to outlandish behavior where they thought they could be the hero or lead, in the tale? Honestly, it's sickening that people teach their kids to think this stuff about half of the population, and this goes for men and women.",

I think it's a double standard in society!\n\nAnd in regards to this whole 'beauty' debate you're so upset about. I just meant in the context of this particular video. My point was in the context of a news reporter on an influencial 'news' show, discussing this hypothetical women's position as a politician. Talking about her effectiveness to govern etc etc. I feel it's unproffessional and even sexist (gasp) to bring in comments about her appearance - as if that is intrinsinctly linked to her worth in that position. Context. I wasn't questioning the entire 'concept' of beauty - relax.\n\nI'm interested in this debate and made a comment to engage people and maybe learn something or have someone change my mind. Don't worry, I'm not some 'tumblr <b> feminazi </b>sympathiser' or what ever you're so afraid of. I mean if you're sat at a computer getting genuinely angry at YouTube comments, trying to convince yourself you're not a complete beta by 'winning' an arguement on the internet calling people 'white knights' that's fine.

I am highly trained in my chosen fields of study and employment. I work hard at everything I do, and it is reflected in my regular raises and promotions. Unfortunately, a lot of the time, when my success is mentioned, so are my looks. I have had multiple coworkers and superiors comment on my looks as being equal to or greater than my skills.\u00a0It's not that it portrays men as \"better\"; it's that it portrays women as objects. Men actually have very little to do with this kind of<b>  sexism</b> you don't seem to think of a<b> s sexis</b>m. Which, btw, this not actually a call that members of privilege groups get to make. You don't get to tell a person of colour what is and isn<b> 't raci</b>st when you're white, because you cannot fully view the experience from their point of view. You are not the one living with the oppression; they are.\n\n\nHas someone ever said about you, \"Chris is a highly skilled, super valuable employee, with a rockin' hot body\"? Or how about, \"Yeah Chris, it's very interesting that you excel at x, y and z. And I mean, you're so hot too! Beauty and brains!\"? Or \"Man, your ass sure looks nice in those slacks. You're working this promotion!\"? What about, \"It's a good thing you're hot, because otherwise you would've had a really hard time landing that job/raise/promotion.\"? Because I and almost ev<b> ery wo</b>man I know has heard things a lot like this in their field. Those are not compliments. These are inappropriate for the topic of discussion, and demeaning to me as a person. Because while I have the good self-esteem to know that I am awesome, my looks are not equal to the value of my hard work and dedication to my education and career. \u00a0\n\n\nImagine having what I just described as  your entire life, day in and day out. I have never had a single man I have discussed the subject of work with talk about anyone treating them like this. Sure some guys have that one girl who hits on them a lot, and makes them horribly uncomfortable. It's equally uncalled for, and while that is harassment, it's not quite the same thing. Because that is harassment, not bla<b> tant se</b>xism. It happens because the harasser is an awful person, not because the victim is male. This specific kind of commenting is not only uncalled for, but also revolves around the fact that it<b>  is a </b>woman being discussed, and therefore she must be critiqued by her outer appearance. I know it seems like a harmless compliment when you're not the one on the receiving end, but when it is the constant, overarching narrative of womens' lives, there is a very serious problem. And these things I have mentioned are the most blatant, easy to decry, casually sexist actions. As are some of the instances in this video, because they are blatant. Most of the aggression is subtle though, and hard to navigate for people who haven't really been there. \n<b> \n\nAs a</b> woman, this shit makes me uncomfortable, and I don't like to be treated like my looks are more important then my career/education/personality/humanity. And most women I know feel the same. We're even telling you now that it makes us feel unsafe and uncomfortable, and that it's sexist because it places value on appearance above and beyond, or equal to personal achievement.",

Yes, there are different degrees when it comes to <b> misogyny,</b> which actually means \" dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against women\": reducing an otherwise serious conversation to a woman's body parts or her physical attractiveness or lack thereof isn't as bad as laughing about harassment which isn't as bad as actually harassing or sexually assaulting someone, but they all stem from the same attitude, which is pervasive in our culture.

                    "commentText": "@ElGranPanda\nIn this case, the stereotype is true. Conservatives are \"pro-life\" - which means they believe that women should not be able to control their own bodies. They would impose compulsory pregnancy on rape survivors--yet at the same time, conservatives also believe there should be virtually no social safety net. No government help for women with unexpected babies. In fact, no government help whatsoever for single Moms. Conservatives also resent paying even an obscenely low minimum wage, and they have all but destroyed public education--all social infrastructure that benefits and protects ordinary people, particularly children and mothers of small children. The Republican/conservatives refuse to impose any kind of gun control, or even a gun registry, even though 10,000 Americans a year are killed by gunfire--literally thousands of them battered women. Conservatives don't give a rat's ass about battered women. They care about their guns, more than they care about any <b> woman.</b> In Canada, the federal Conservatives defunded aid to medical clinics in<b>  African</b> countries, clinics that frequently treated women with obstetric fistulas, a horrifying childbirth injury requiring surgery--if those clinics also performed abortions, or provided abortion information. Think about that. An obstetric fistula is a ticket to endless pain, loss of continence, social isolation--and Harper's conservatives knew this, and still stopped the aid to those clinics. The malice of conservatives towards women is boundless. The conservatives are profoundly hostile to working people in general, and campaign incessantly to weaken labor laws, even though these laws protect workers from exploitation; this has a huge negative impact on working people of both sexes, but it is particularly hard on women, who usually work in the home as well as outside it, and who still provide most childcare. Conservatives, of course, would never dream of funding day care centers. I could go on and on. The evidence is overwhelming: conservatives hate women. Actions speak louder than words.",

You presume custody of our bodies. And you don't like poor people much either; your contempt for poor people and single moms drips off every word. You lecture me about how you don't want to have to \"spoon feed\" single moms. Lecturing poor people and in particular, single moms on how they should be \"tough\" in the face of grinding poverty, is a classic pronouncement of the conservative woman-hater. And of course, you don't give a damn that literally thousands of American women are killed every year by crazed, gun-wielding ex-boyfriends and husbands; if you did care, even the tiniest bit, you wouldn't be able to dismiss the slaughter with a stupid quip about how guns don't kill people, people do. If conservatives cared about women at all, they would at least support gun laws that made sense. But Conservatives will tolerate absolutely no gun control, no reforms that might keep these deadly weapons out of the hands of lunatics and wife beaters--nothing. On every issue, you conservatives are against the poor, against working people, and against the rights of women. If the shoe fits...as I said, all conservatives, all of them, are <b> misogynist,</b> because conservatism is a<b>  misogynist</b> ideology.",

It's not the best of human.  Thankfully, most men, and most conservatives are not unlovable or unloving. This kind of behavior can happen from women to men as well (it's about power).  The women here are getting paid by a patriarchal institution (as are the men) so that influences their behavior, too.

Women aren't even allowed \nto have full ownership over their own bodies. You can still find men crying,whining and raging on the internet just because a <b> woman </b>stated \"I have full ownership over my own body\" on Twitter,Facebook,etc,trying to guilt trip her and make it sound like that statement is offensive when it's really not. Women still can't even talk about their<b>  sexual</b> assault stories without men butting in trying to guilt trip the victims for something other men did. We can't even fucking have ONE DAY of International Women's Day without men butting in with their \"bUt wHat aBouT mEn iNtErnAtiOnaL's DaY?!\". Everyday,bitch. Everyday is International Men's Day. And you're fucking kidding me right? You aren't allowed to be masculine? Why? Did someone threaten to kill you if you act masculine or display your masculinity? Bitch,you saw a few memes making fun of masculinity and suddenly you're the most oppressed group in the world. Fuck out of here with that bullshit! You retarde<b> d r<b> e</b</b>>d piller masculinazis always think masculine = toxic masculinity. Feminity has done and brou<b> ght noth</b>ing to women except used as a tool by men to \"put women in their place\" for CENTURIES !!! It's even happening in this century! We can't even do what we like to do like playing sports without getting sexualized,accused of having ulterior motives or have our ability dimissed or downplayed by men!!! EVERY.SINGLE.TIME!!!\n\nJust remember this one :-\nMen are afraid women will laugh at them. Women are afraid men will kill them.\n\nYou're not the most oppressed group. You never were. If you're in MY place,you would've comitted suicide by now. I'm being brutally honest. You're NOT oppressed.",
