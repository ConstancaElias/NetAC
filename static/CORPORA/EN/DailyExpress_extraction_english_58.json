I'm female but thankfully Waitrose let me purchase this anyway.', 'Ms Lane shared the image with Everyday Sexism, an online organisation which documents day - to - day incidents of casual sexism.', 'A Waitrose spokeswoman said: It's never our intention to cause offence - we're not dictating who should eat this sandwich.', 'We hope anyone who tries it will love the distinctive flavours.', 'However, we are planning to change the name of the sandwich soon.'",
