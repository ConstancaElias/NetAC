        "postText": "LBC host Nick Ferrari spoke to Caller Peter on his radio show after a revelation from Nigel Farage. The Brexit Party leader claimed that Conservatives were offering his candidates jobs to get them to stand down. Peter attacked Mr Farage as a predator, and also told Mr Ferrari that by voting leave, he was in league with every single racist in the country.', 'Peter said: People like Nigel Farage, they prey on the ill-informed, uneducated and gullible.   ', '   The LBC host immediately snapped back that Peter had been so rude to 17.4 million people.   ', '   However,   the caller insisted: Not all of them knew what they were voting for. The reality is even you didn't know what you were voting for.', 'You voted for Brexit on a basis of racism in Eastern Europe, and still ended up on the same side of the argument as every other racist in Britain.',    Mr Ferrari shot back: I really enjoy our conversations,   but actually that is breathtakingly arrogant of you to tell me I didn 't know what I was voting for., '   I would never say that to you, I would never say that to anyone. That, respectfully, is so arrogant.', '   How can you honestly tell me I didn 't know what I was voting for? Really?',   'Peter tried to defend his claim by referring back to past words of the radio host.',   'He said: I'   ve heard your passionate speech about the reasons you 've voted for Brexit.',   But if you would look a bit deeper, you would realise that you casted your vote in order to combat racism in Eastern Europe because you didn't want to be a part of the countries which has too many racists.,   'You have too many racists in all countries around the world, not just in Eastern Europe, but in Britain as well. You voted the same way that every single racist in the country voted.',   'Mr Ferrari was less than impressed: You<99>re now saying that effectively every single person who voted to leave is a racist.',   'I<99>m sure you<99>re a good bloke, and if I met you on Wimbledon high street, I<99>m sure we<99>d get on and have a cup of coffee.',   Please consider your language, this is exactly what we don't need at this time.,   'Everyone who voted to leave is not a racist, Peter.',   'I think we<99>ve had this argument respectfully.",

EU policy makers are not answerable to the electorate nor its own Parliament. EU issuing directives on things oddities like cabbages celex:32006R0634. EU manufacturing directives even apply to goods for export!   The EU is corrupt, its own Audit Office refuses to sign off the EU's accounts year after year!  There are over 3,000 lobby groups in Brussels and there is no oversight to stop EU officials being bribed.  The EU sets protectionist tariffs on things like sugar, just to protect minority interests like Belgium  sugar beet farmers.   The EU has record youth unemployment but the EU initiated an Open Door immigration policy,  a policy that no EU country can override.  The EU energy policy wiped out the UK's energy intensive industries.  The EU removed the protectionist tariff on Russian Aluminium that wiped out the UK aluminium industry; because the EU did nothing to compensate UK industry for the EU carbon taxes that it levied thus making them UNVIABLE.  Then the jobs the EU has destroyed in the UK, by giving grants and cheap loans to multi-nationals to move manufacturing to the Eastern EU.  Now who's the uneducated, ill-informed and gullible?  I would say its the Remainers who are mis-informed, gullible and extremely suggestible as they didn't even bother to VERIFY what they were being TOLD, they didn't check the FACTS!",

Not where I live, but in the North of the country that is a problem. Saying it's difficult to widen the argument is not true.  Personally I don't want to be a part of a United States of Europe, and I have never wanted to be in anything other than the Trading Partnership we went into in the 1970's.  I also believe the UK is being used as a Bank to support other member countries, that are milking the system.  The recent flooding of Venice is a prime example of corruption in Italy. The flood defences have been hindered by it, and the Political weakness in the country.",
