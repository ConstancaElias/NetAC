Is shopping still a wife\u2019s job?', 'Another listener, Anna Wilson, tweeted: Ewen Cameron Watt at BlackRock is very lucky \u2013 he doesn\u2019t have to shop for things because he\u2019s married!', 'Ukip leadership candidate Jane Collins added: I thought we\u2019d gone back in time with that dinosaur comment. I\u2019d be interested to know how many women are in senior positions at BlackRock and hope it is a significant number based on merit.', 'Mr Cameron Watt studied at Oxford University and served as an independent adviser to the Bank of', 'England pension fund between 2000 and 2006. He lives with wife Penelope in a \u00a32.3million Oxfordshire home.', 'BlackRock last night said it was unable to comment.'",
