        "postText": "A 32-year-old black man cancelled his date after a woman he\u2019d been speaking to on Tinder for weeks said she \u2018doesn\u2019t go to black people places\u2019.', 'Nicky Sowemimo was taken aback when he got the message, just as they were about to meet for their first date at Soho Zebrano in London\u2019s West End.', 'The unnamed white woman said she was afraid to go into the cocktail bar by herself in case there were too many black people.', 'She said she would not go to Caribbean food chain Rum Kitchen by herself again because she was \u2018nearly the only one white person there\u2019 last time.', 'A dumbfounded Nicky said: That\u2019s\u2026 a strange thing to say\u2019.', 'He added: \u2018Gonna be honest I really don\u2019t like what you\u2019re saying.', '\u2018If you\u2019re uncomfortable about black people why are we meeting?\u2019', 'His date seems unrepentant as she casually responds: \u2018It\u2019s cool we don\u2019t have to meet up then. Probably wasn\u2019t meant to be then.\u2019', 'The woman was aware of Nicky\u2019s background and ethnicity when they first matched, which left him all the more surprised.', 'Recalling the date that never was, he told Metro.co.uk: \u2018If I\u2019m honest there were a couple of questionable comments last week.', '\u2018Maybe I overlooked them and brushed them off. At the time it wasn\u2019t enough for me to assume the worst, I generally don\u2019t assume the worst of people.', '\u2018It all just kind of came out very quickly \u2013 it went from zero to 100.\u2019', 'He was just yards from the bar before he stopped in his tracks and decided to abandon the date.', 'Nicky added: \u2018It\u2019s not even a place that I would say is predominately frequented by black people so that doesn\u2019t make sense.', '\u2018That\u2019s actually quite a startling level of concern that you can\u2019t actually go into this place. You\u2019re that scared that you can\u2019t go into it.\u2019', 'Sadly, he says he has met people before who claim they are not racist because they are dating someone of another ethnicity, while avoiding places where they themselves are a minority.', 'The communications officer added: \u2018There are obviously people who date interracially but still have some quite unpleasant views.', '\u2018I think maybe it\u2019s something people don\u2019t always realise they\u2019re doing wrong.\u2019', 'He says some people treat their interracial relationships like a get out of jail free card and feel like they can\u2019t be accused of racism because of it.', 'Nicky\u2019s sister Annabel added: \u2018Often it centres on the same historic stereotypes of feeling unsafe or feeling that the space is \u201cghetto\u201d.', '\u2018It\u2019s not an uncommon issue that people are happy to date a black individual but want them to abandon any cultural ties at the front door.', '\u2018It may not seem particularly sinister until you delve into bigger issues, start raising a family and then the overt racism is evident.\u2019', 'Nicky seems to have dodged a bullet.', 'Not only was his date pretty open about her racist views, she doubled down on her bigotry after being blocked on WhatsApp and Tinder.', 'She told him: \u2018I think it\u2019s very rude just to block someone when travelling 1.5 hour. But it\u2019s okay. I wish u all the best.', '\u2018Probably one of the reasons to stay away from Nigerians. You\u2019re just on a different level.\u2019', 'Thankfully, Nicky has started speaking to someone else on Tinder who he hopes things are going well with.', 'A spokesman for Zebrano said: \u2018Although we\u2019d rather not comment on the events detailed in the article, we\u2019d still like to set our own stall out.', '\u2018London is one of the world\u2019s most multi-cultural cities and we\u2019re proud to be part of the diverse and inclusive area of Greek Street, Soho.', '\u2018Zebrano has a wide range of events from Drag Brunches to live music and comedy nights; so we feel very honoured to have a client base reflective of London\u2019s rich tapestry.', '\u2018We\u2019re sorry to hear of Nicky\u2019s disappointment, but every cloud has a silver lining.', '\u2018The Zebrano team would like to invite Nicky to have his next Tinder date on us, with a complimentary Pizza & Bottomless Prosecco meal to enjoy with a guest of his choice.', '\u2018We can certainly guarantee that Nicky\u2019s next date will be a much better experience.\u2019",
