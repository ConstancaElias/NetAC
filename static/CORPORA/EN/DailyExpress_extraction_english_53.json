        "postText": "'The newly-opened Aldi branch in Otford Road, Sevenoaks, Kent, has enraged a male shopper who accused the German supermarket chain of gender inequality.', 'Following his visit to the shop, which was launched two weeks ago, the man, who asked to remain anonymous, found upsetting that car parkings reserved to families where marked in white paint with a woman holding a child\u2019s hand.', 'In his opinion, markings should not portray any specific gender.', 'He said: Does this mean Aldi are expecting only women and mothers to go shopping?', 'Should fathers and men park elsewhere? They are happy with the child having no obvious gender.', 'I wanted to highlight the issue as its a little frustrating in 2018.', 'It seems that the onus is still on women that they must raise the family and manage this \u2013 which is unfair.', 'I guess its more of an unconscious bias that we have in us, and we are all guilty at various times.', 'It was just something that irritated me.', 'I was surprised and disappointed that a store like Aldi, who seems to want to be the newcomer to the area and market, would have an old fashioned way of thinking.', 'Aldi use Team GB to promote their brand and we are, as a society, trying to be more equal \u2013 especially within sports.', 'Express.co.uk has contacted Aldi for a comment.', 'Other supermarket chains in Kent have created parking spaces for families.', 'However, they have used markings showing genderless parents and children or have included both men and women.', This latest allegation of sexism comes after several companies rebranded a number products seen as sexist by social media campaigns and customers.', 'Waitrose has pledged to rebrand its Gentleman\u2019s Smoked Chicken Caesar Roll, as the gender specification has been perceived sexist by many customers.', 'And Kleenex rebranded one of its most iconic products launched in 1956, the Mansize tissue box, renaming it Extra Large.', 'A social media user demanded the name of the product to be changed writing on Twitter: Hi @Kleenex_UK. My four year old son asked me what was written here.', 'Then he asked, why are they called mansize?', Can girls, boys and mummies use them?', 'I said: 'I don\u2019t know and yes of course.', 'He suggests you should call them \u2018very large tissues\u2019. It is 2018.', 'Another Twitter user said: In this day and age, is it right for @Kleenex_UK to have a product that is MANsized?', 'The world is changing maybe they should too? #BOUCRY', A spokesperson for Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex\u2019s parent company, said: Kleenex Mansize tissues have been on shelves for the past 60 years. The brand has been characterised by a much larger tissue size, which is both soft and durable.', 'It was launched at a time when large cotton handkerchiefs were still very popular and Kleenex offered a unique disposable alternative. To this day, it remains one of our most popular products, with over 3.4 million people buying the tissues every year.', 'We are always grateful to customers who take time to tell us how our products can be improved, and we carefully consider all suggestions. Thanks to recent feedback we are now rebranding our Mansize tissues to Kleenex Extra Large.'",
