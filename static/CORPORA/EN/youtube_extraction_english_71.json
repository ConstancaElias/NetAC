But that was the BEGINNING of time. This is the<b>  age</b> of knowledge and understanding, a changing point. And you know women helped out in ancient and early civilizations than just gathering? Women helped fight off predators and obtain food, they helped their clans' migrate and move, shoot some even lead clans. \nBut apart of ancient history, lets get back to our moder<b> n ag</b>e. Women have just as much capability of men do. We are practically equal. Yes a few hormones and muscles may be justified but that doesn't make any significant changes. And if you think men always over power women, why don't we take a look at some of our historical women who've practically conquered men in both muscle and intelligence wise. I mean, I had the highest test scores in my district and school and I am a female.\nBut if you want to continue living in the savage ancient ages you can go to a developing country in Africa",

That's not very far from saying: That child is not my responsibility because it came from your body. Guys are often the ones that don't want kids, let them pay the price for that, imo it should be split 50/50 with your sexpartner. If you're the kind of girl to sleep around yeah, you should pay for your own contraception BUT if you're in a relationship it is ridiculous to let the <b> woman </b>take all the responsibility, you both don't want a baby? how about you both pay the price. Also: fuck those guys that tell women to use the pill just because they don't want to wear a rubber, it's been proven rubbers don't take away any of the feeling.. It is just plain bullshit and laziness. Personally i wouldn't want to get pregnant so i think the guy should have condoms at his house and i should have them at mine, if we get serious and i need to take birth-control pills we'll both pay for it 50/50 if he wants me to take them (because i'd rather not).",

I believe that all contraception should be affordable regardless of <b> gender.</b> With that said:\u00a0\nMens contraception is relatively cheap compared to women's. I have been on birth control since I was 13 because of cysts on my ovaries that could potentially grow and make me infertile, so birth control was prescribed to prevent them growing.\nAt the beginning of every year my first prescription pack is not covered by insurance due to insurance renewal. The price is 92 dollars. for one pack, which happens to be the most generic and therefore least expensive option avalible. 92 dollars every month if insurance does not cover some of it, which it should since i pay money to them for that very reason. Again i dont agree with federal taxes covering it but something does need to be done, all though i have no idea nor opinions on how to make that happen.\n\nIt is not that women feel more entitled than men to contraception, \u00a0it is that the only reliable forms are expensive for us and in many cases are also for our health, not necessarily<b>  sex</b>. \u00a0without affordable birth control available to me i would not be able to have children and would have needed surgery to remove the cysts.",

When a man complains about the <b> sexism </b>and discrimination against his<b>  sex</b>, us women do not need to downgrade their struggles just to prove that the discrimination towards us is \"better\" and more critical than theirs. We are all victims of the discrimination of media. It is true that women are more sexualized than men, but calling men out for complaining that there is not enough representation for the discrimination towards them is the total opposite of what the representation project is trying to achieve. Telling men that they do not have as much problems as\u00a0us women is making it seem like the discrimination towards men is not important or non-exist, even though it so clearly does exist, and which is just as worse as\u00a0saying that\u00a0the discrimination towards women is a myth.\u00a0Stop telling men that they are \"overreacting\" about their problems because that is just as sexist and discriminatory as if the comment was directed towards <b> a woma</b>n.",

Just because she won't fuck you or your kind doesn't mean you should taunt and tease them\nYou probably don't because the only lesbians you ever see is from a computer screen on pornhub which would make you think the only thing lesbians can do is making you masturbate and that they're just <b> dumb </b>fools who are only good for<b>  sex</b>. Maybe if you started acting like a fucking adult and being a little bit more just and civilized maybe someone will actually love your depressed self.\n\n(P.s.

I mean, in western society there are lots of things which arguably aren't that bad, compared to the third world. <b> Sexism </b>might not be the biggest problem we have, but I'd say it's big enough to be worth fighting for regardless.

            "commentText": "You guys are kidding me right? So this is your thing, you just compile a bunch of clips, all of the mean things said to women that you could find, from all of politics on the entire Internet. You take them all out of context, so it's just one line of something someone says. Then mix in some tabloid covers, some bitchy tweets form some random columnist, and a few headlines from, uh, just some random dude's blog.\u00a0\nIs that it really, this is your big YouTube campaign? Then, you just throw in any mention of appearance whether it's about a female politician or female journalist, whether it's positive or negative. That's not allowed either? None of it? Wow. Well hey, you know what, I'll let you in on something. Everyone in the public eye, man, <b> woman,</b> or teenage pop-star, is continuously scrutinized on their appearance. They haven't stopped talking about President Obama's looks since the start. \"Handsome<b>  black</b> man from Chicago\" raised no protest, well that's a nice thing to say. How about now though? Is it a problem when the discussion is \"He has aged quite a bit since he first took office.\" Um, yeah. Ha! Duh guys, of course he has. The guy has the most stressful job on the planet doesn't he?\u00a0\nBut what else do you expect living life under a spotlight?\nSo, seriously is that an issue? No?\nBut saying Hillary is starting to look like Madeline Albright is some crime against all of womankind? Hillary can't take that punch, that's what you're saying? Albright isn't even that much older than Hillary and she was the sam<b> e ag</b>e when she was the Secretary of State, but, like any of that even matters. These people are going to say whatever they want. Freedom of speech, remember? Also, some of them are obviously joking. I'm not saying it's funny, but it's obviously not serious. You do have the option to laugh that one off. But instead of showing indifference, or better yet strength, we'll just cry. Point and say sexist because you can. Becau<b> se nobo</b>dy in the very same media you're whining about is even bold enough to question if it's a fair accusation.\nWhat about when all they wanted to do was bash on Governor Chris Christie about his weight? I couldn't believe it, that shit cracked me up. They just kept saying over and over again, half pretending to be concerned, 'Oh well he's much <b> too </b>fat to be president, you don't want him to having a heart attack in the oval office.\" They even got some quack doctor to make a public statement like 'My professional diagnosis is he's, extre<b> mely</b> fat. Oh yes indeed, super<b> dupe</b>r fat gone any day now I'm afraid.' Haha! Give me a fuckin break! Yeah, he is<b>  a b</b>ig fat guy! Hahahaha. His mom is Sicilian for Christ s<b> ake the </b>doctors need one of those BMI charts adjusted for all that dope ass Italian food. That's 'God's Kitchen' man. He's probably barely over par for Sicilians. Anyway, who, the fuck, cares? He isn't d<b> ange</b>rous fat. Come on, he'<b> s re</b>gular old Sa<b> nta </b>Clause fat! But that's the whole point. He's fine. It was never even about the weight. They just don't like his politics and they're attacking aspects of his character because it's easier and it works. That's just the way that whole stupid game is played. So please stop this thing you're doing, recognize this distraction kindergarten nonsense news for what it really is, and for the love of God would you please make something that resembles a coherent political argument. Unless I missed something here.\nSo what is it then, your brilliant solution? Is it to outlaw saying anything mean about your opponent's intelligence or appearance?\nOr are you trying to say female politicians should be given some kind of special protection from insult in all public forums because, I don't know, they're women? Because that kind of sounds to me like one of those, uh... you know that thing\u2026\u00a0\nIs it 'double standard'?\nSeriously, what is the mission?\nBecause to be completely honest, I don't think you organization's top priorities are helping American women. I think you're primarily a left wing group using some emotional appeals to stir up support from women voters.\u00a0\n\nSo, after really looking for a point in your stupid little video it seems like it might actually be saying women are too sensitive to handle dissenting voices and shouldn't hold public office. You should go check on that.\n\nI disagree about film and advertising too. I'd try to change everyone's minds but I feel like it would probably just be a bigger waste of time and I've already wasted too much time. You've got a catchy song.\u00a0\n\nIt's not about reason at all anymore.",

But, talking about being carried over into real life, it is psychological effect that media has on everyone not only male or female, unless you can say that female watches more media entertainment than male. It is just a traditional role that has been taken by female are weaker and more feminine, but it takes time to push feminism in the world after all not everyone like changes even though it is a good change. But in the mean time, certain females should stop misusing the word equality and feminism at the wrong occasion.\nFemales are not FORCED TO TAKE OFF clothes, it is a choice, you can choose to sign contract with the movie or not. if females can be forced to do that, the world would be chaotic although i believe sometimes there is \"under the table\" agreement but still it does not happen now.",

Secondly, for every dollar that a man makes, a <b> woman </b>makes $0.80. Thirdly, there are very few female CEO's of fortune five hundred companies. Yes men are expected to hold doors open, but women do return the favor, and in comparison these are trivial.",
