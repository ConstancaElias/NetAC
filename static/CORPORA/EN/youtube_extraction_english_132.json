Perlyann could follow reporting protocols, Perlyann's amazing. I experience it at uni, especially when I have to collaborate, some cohorts are worse than others. This semester is a good one, last semester they were atrocious. I'm not going to dress in ripped jeans and a tee shirt to fit in.",

But as I listened, I recalled a situation where I was working in my early 40s and a<b>  woman</b> who had been retired for many years joined our team on a temporary assignment. I recall feeling frustrated with her on a few occasions but i believe my frustration was about suggestions which I felt were not realistic long term. I think people who have been out of the work force forget what it's like to be in the daily grind and the suggestions that they make live on after their assignment is done. There are some other factors that I think led to my frustration but it too long for this post. In my view when we're looking at Aging in a proud and strong way we should look at people like Maya Angelou, Jane Goodall etc... what these women had i<b> n commo</b>n was a strong purpose to make the world a better place and I think we can all do that in our own way and therefore will spend less time thinking about what people think of us.",

My last job I was terribly abused emotionally by younger workers and those my<b>  age</b> that after four years, I left, that is when I retired. It's very long to go into, but from day one I showed them up by being professional. That's how I work, from how I treat people  on the phone or in person by my demeanor and speech. They were the opposite and didn't like it, so they would make remarks, faces behind my back, the environment was very toxic. The nicer I would be, the worse it would get. For the first time in my life I called them into the manager<b> . Nothin</b>g changed. In fact, one person in particular was called into the office several times by others, but they never let her go. The stress was way too much, I needed to have left years earlier. But I had to work. So when I was at the youngest retireme<b> nt a</b>ge, I left. The bottom line was they were jealous of me and I couldn't do anything about that and I tried with all my might. Very painful memories. I don't have to deal with that abuse anymore. It's nice being retired and free. Thank you for listening. I'm sure there are many stories out there. In fact, I don't know of anyone in the work place who hasn't had experienced similar situations. It's the human factor and how individually we decide to deal with it. Stay or leave. I moved on. Thank you again for your subject matter.",

However, no one deserves to be driven out of the workplace especially someone who is professional and has lots to offer and contribute. I am particularly annoyed when I see the process for bringing a complaint of discrimination and harassment breaks down because the employer refuses to take appropriate action. In most countries, there are employment standards that overlap and integrate to address physical, <b> mental,</b> and emotional health in the workplace. Most standards are specific around 'zero tolerance' for discrimination and harassment. However, so much is still imbedded and accepted as normal. My one hope for 'younger' women in the workforce is that they will shake up the norm and protest the bad behaviour in the workplace. We, young and<b>  old</b>, need to make employers accountable for the environment THEY create and perpetuate. Off my soap box now.",
