        "postText": "Over half of Conservative Party members believe Islam is \u2018generally a threat to the British way of life\u2019 and that Trump would make a good prime minister of the UK, a new poll has revealed.', 'The YouGov survey also found that 58 per cent of Tory party members believe the death penalty should be allowed for certain crimes, against 37 per cent who do not back the return of capital punishment.', 'Some 56 per cent of members surveyed said Islam was \u2018generally a threat\u2019 to the British way of life, while just 22 per cent thought it was \u2018generally compatible\u2019.', 'The findings come as the party struggles to shake off accusations it has failed to deal with Islamophobia.', 'On Mr Trump\u2019s leadership, 54 per cent said they believed he would make a good prime minister of the UK, with 43 per cent saying he would be bad.', 'Commissioned for Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches programme, the survey also found that 42 per cent of members thought that having people from a wide variety of racial and cultural backgrounds has damaged British society.', 'The programme, which is set to be broadcast at 8pm today, highlights Islamophobic posts on Facebook from self-identifying members of the Tory party.', 'One of the members of the Boris Johnson supporters group said: \u2018I would ban all Muslim (sic) from entering the whole of Great Britain.\u2019', 'A member of the Jacob Rees Mogg Appreciation Society said: \u2018Two mega mosques agreed planning permission in Maidstone and Worcester, how we feel about this?\u2019 Another person posted: \u2018WRONG.\u2019', 'The poll also revealed scepticism about the dangers posed by climate change, with 46 per cent of Tory members saying concerns about climate change had been exaggerated, while 45 per cent said the danger is every bit as real as scientists have said.', 'Some 49 per cent of members said schools should not be required to educate children about LGBT relationships, and 51 per cent thought most people on benefits could get a job if they tried hard enough.', 'Party members will be choosing the next party leader and prime minister.', 'A Conservative spokesperson said: \u2018Those people making these posts that we have found to be members of the party, have been suspended pending investigation.\u2019', '\u2018Discrimination or abuse of any kind is wrong and will not be tolerated.\u2019', 'Mr Rees-Mogg said the Jacob Rees Mogg Appreciation Society Facebook group is not an official supporters\u2019 group, adding: \u2018I absolutely condemn such behaviour.', '\u2018Anyone who behaves in such a way is not one of my supporters and should be reported.\u2019', 'Miqdaad Versi, a spokesperson for the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), last month revealed he had documented \u2018hundreds of cases\u2019 showing Islamophobia in Tory ranks.', 'The MCB has submitted more than 20 pages of evidence to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, urging independent investigators to launch an official probe into accusations within the party.",

Yet the MCB seem to think it is and are applying political pressure wherever possible in the hope to redefine what constitutes islamaphobia. This is their latest effort, to try to imply tories are any different to another sector of society and yet they conveniently fall silent over anything damning to their agenda.",

WHY SHOULDNT WE BE WORRIED !!  We must have an official enquiry into the intentions and spread of Islam in this country. I'm a Christian my family are all Christian. Why wouldn't we worry that according to numbers   Muslims will out number Christians at some point in the future.  <b> Common </b>SENCE tells us when that happens  Christians will not be happy living in their own country. Domination by Muslims will inevitably mean our  culture will slowly be wiped out.  And we are not supposed to be concerned !!!!!!!",
