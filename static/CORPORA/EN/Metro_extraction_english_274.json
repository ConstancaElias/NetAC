Virgin then phones us in October to inform us it had been chosen to be the Pride Flight.', '\u2018They asked if we wanted to change flight which meant travelling on a different day which we couldn\u2019t do, so we went ahead as planned.\u2019', 'She said they had a \u2018fantastic time\u2019 as they celebrated with celebrity passengers including Ru Paul\u2019s superstar Courtney Act, I\u2019m a Celebrity winner Scarlett Moffatt, Strictly\u2019s AJ Prichard and Netflix star Titus Burgess.', 'Kerry added: \u2018It was brilliant, the kids enjoyed it and the eight hours flew by.\u2019', 'Tickets for the plane sold out within 24 hours and many of the passengers were travelling from the UK to join Sunday\u2019s World Pride parade in the Big Apple.', 'DJ Jodie Harsh delivered the tunes on the aircraft while passengers snacked on rainbow eclairs.', 'End of dialog window.', 'The trip was organised to coincide with the international pride event, which is commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising.', 'The flight had been adequately named VS69, to mark the year that the iconic riots took place.', 'Also onboard the special journey was Stonewall veteran and LGBT+ icon, Tree Sequoia, 80, who still works as a bartender in New York at the site of the 1969 demonstrations.', 'Mark Anderson, the Global LGBTQ+ Lead for Virgin Group, said that it was very important to mark the occasion.', 'He said: \u2018At Virgin, we take our commitment to diversity and inclusion seriously. We also know how to put on a seriously fun party.', '\u2018To mark this momentous anniversary in the history and future of LGBTQ+ rights, we wanted to do everything possible to give customers the Pride experience of a lifetime.\u2019",
